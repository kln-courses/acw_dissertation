IS AND OUGHT One of the peculiarities of political economy is the clash between the words and deeds of its protagonists. For over a century, econo- mists have repeatedly declared that economic science is concerned only with observing, describing, analyzing, and predicting events, and never with recommending, giving advice, or'prescribing.

Clark, and in our times Professors Pigou and Robbins, as well as almost any textbook on economics, have affirmed that economics is about what is and could or might be, never about what ought to be. Yet, in spite of these declarations of the scientific, neutral char- acter of economics, virtually all economists have in fact advised, recommended, exhorted, warned, etc., - and all this with the aid of arguments derived directly from the "science" of economics. It is possible to argue that for the economists in the great utilitarian tradition the distinction between is and ought is not fundamental. Like other rationalist systems of philosophy, utilita- rianism holds that ought can be deduced from is and could be. There is, indeed, evidence that the distinction between science and politics (or ethics) was thought to be merely classificatory. Economics as a science (in the narrow sense) is about facts, economics as an art is about values and policies. If this interpretation is adopted, the declarations as to the scientific character of economics amount to no more than a convenient classification into "pure" or "theoretical," and "applied" or "practical," economics.2 The difficulty that stands in the way of accepting this inter- pretation is the extreme importance which authors attach to the value-free character of economics, and the fervor with which they denounce in their methodological introductions any attempts to derive recommendations from the analysis of facts. I think they mean what they say, yet they never practice it. The sharp division between is and ought, between positive and normative pursuits, is so widely accepted today that the inconsistency of the writers in the classical tradition might strike one as either gross carelessness or dishonesty. But one must remember that the habits of rationalistic philosophies, particularly those of the philosophy of natural law and of utilitarianism, according to which values and rules are either identical with, or can be derived from, facts, have deep and tough roots. Neither Adam Smith nor James Mill believed 1. For references see Gunnar Myrdal, The Political Element in the Develop- ment of Economic Theory, pp. 3f. The distinction between programs and prognoses is taken over from Appendix 2, "Note on Facts and Valuations," p. 1061 of Gunnar Myrdal's An American Dilemma. My whole essay owes a great debt to Dr. Myrdal's ideas, particularly the suggestions in section 6 as to what should be the task of economics. I should also like to thank Mr. James Maxwell for helpful criticism, and Mr. G. B. Richardson for stimulating conversations. 2. See, e.g., J. N. Keynes, Scope and Method of Political Economy, p. 39.

On the other hand, today we accept perhaps too easily the belief that the distinction between is and ought is always obvious, clear-cut, and easy to draw. I propose to re-examine the relation- ship between these two spheres as far as it is relevant to economic and social studies. My conclusion will be that the distinction is not so clear-cut as those steeped in the tradition of Humean empiricism occasionally believe.3 II. PROGRAM AND PROGNOSIS In the following I shall make use of two key concepts, "program" and "prognosis." By "program" I mean a plan of intended action, e.g., a party program, the objectives of trade unions, farmers' or traders' associations, etc. A program is the formulation of a policy. It consists of certain objectives or ends and rules about the manner in which these objectives are to be pursued. By "prognosis" I mean a forecast of the probable or possible course of events. A prognosis is based on observation and analysis, and consists of the application to particular instances of generaliza- tions about the actual and hypothetical connections between facts and events. This distinction is related to the more familiar one between analysis and policy. "Prognosis" stresses the predictive character of analysis; "program" is a concrete formulation of policy. The dis- tinction is also related to the familiar means-ends dichotomy, but it is not the same. The means-ends model was constructed in order to salvage something of what appeared to be a normative science, in an age when the rationalistic faith in discoverable values had declined, and scepticism and relativism had grown stronger. If the dichotomy is tenable, a teleological argument can be conducted on objective 3. Hume's complaint was that "in every system of morality which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes some observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprised to find that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, it is necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time, that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it." A Treatise of Human Nature, Book III, Part I, end of Section Il.</page><page sequence="4">358 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS lines, as long as the hypothetical clause about ends is inserted. All valuations are bundled together under the rubric "ends," and the appropriateness of means can then be discussed "scientifically." But, as I shall argue below, people attach value not merely to "ends," in the sense of the desired ultimate results of a course of events, but also to the means by which ends are achieved. This com- plex of desired ends, means and procedures, and effects other than ends which may be inevitable outcomes, all of which is conditioned by valuations, I call "program." In terms of the distinction between program and prognosis much of economic analysis looks like the attempt to derive programs directly from analysis and prognosis. Critics have repeatedly pointed out that such attempts stem from a confusion, and that clear thinking requires that ends (which are a part of programs) be separated from means (analysis and prediction). The most recent formulation of this view can be found in the theory of the social welfare function.4 The social welfare function is a hold-all for all valuations, set out in a definite order, a device which is supposed to purify economic investigation of all vestiges of unscientific matter. My argument is that the interdependence of program and prognosis is in the nature of social theory, and that the obstacles to their separation are not just muddle-headedness. The purists claim that it is possible and desirable to separate sharply (a) the prognosis based on an objective analysis of a situa- tion in which programs are taken as data, from (b) the program based on this analysis. In fact, there is mutual interaction, and each is partly determined and modified by the other. My criticism of the view that independent prognosis is possible is similar, as far as I can see, to the criticism of modern physicists of the assumption that observer and observed do not affect each other. It has been found that it is inherently impossible to observe exactly both the position and the velocity of a particle, even if all experimental errors are eliminated. This discovery did not lead to the abandonment of observation, but to a reformulation of the model used. Similarly, the fact that program and prognosis affect each other forces us to abandon such models as "economics is the science of the allocation of scarce means 4. A.

III. PROGRAM DETERMINED BY PROGNOSIS Pigou prefaced his Wealth and Welfare with a quotation from Charles Booth: "discontent, to be effective, must be shot through with the colours of hope." He was convinced that in his analysis hope could be found. A program, to be effective, must take account of the probable and possible future course of events, in other words, it must be based on analysis and prognosis. Programs are altered in the light of new knowledge about the facts. Programs without prognoses are idle wish-dreams or empty protests. More particularly, analysis and prognosis can point out the implications of alternative choices, and the consistency or inconsist- ency of objectives contained in a program. They may indicate the proper policies for achieving given objectives, in so far as values are not attached to the policies as such, and the probable consequences of given policies. They may show to what extent the short-term interests manifested in a program are compatible with the long-term interests of a group, to what extent the objectives expressed in a program diverge from the actual conduct of the group in question (pointing out rationalizations and hypocrisy), and to what extent this conduct is consistent. It appears therefore that the ends are never given, in the sense required by those who believe in the possibility of a neutral welfare theory. Ends are modified: 1. In the light of fuller knowledge of the facts. 2. In the light of what is believed can, and what cannot, be altered. But amongst these "data" are the ends of other people; therefore ends are altered in the light of the programs, and the power behind the programs, of others. Many conservative recommenda- tions rest on the conviction that "you can't change human nature," whereas socialists derive hope from the belief that institutions deter- mine human nature. Disputes between revolutionaries and reformists are often about whether certain institutions can be changed. Opinions as to the factual problem of what are the constants, will condition men's moral and political convictions.5 3. In the light of other ends which develop as one set of ends is explored, and in the light of undesirable, previously unforeseen, 5. But the convictions may also color their view of the "facts." See below.</page><page sequence="6">360 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS results which interfere either with the "given," or with the newly discovered, ends. To put the same thing another way: Analysis and prognosis modify programs in the following ways: 1. Programs may become more consistent through being better informed, and thus more effective. 2. Value standards, previously only implicit, or altogether absent, may be activated as a result of the facts turned up by analysis. (See Section V.) 3. Confusions not only about the relations of facts, but also about one's own desires may be cleared up. Rationalizations and pseudo-interests may give place to knowledge of real interests. 4. Divergencies between words and deeds, action and belief, may become apparent. For any of these reasons, programs may be altered as a result of the clarification of certain facts. This relationship, however, is complicated because there is no logical connection between false beliefs about the world and valuations based on them, on the one hand, and correct beliefs and valuations based on them, on the other hand. If it were not for this complication, it might still be possible to maintain the dichotomy between ends and means. If we were given programs based on erroneous factual beliefs, we might be able to deduce logically what programs would be pursued if the errors were corrected. This is the view expressed by Max Weber in his discussion of the objectivity of social science.6 In fact, this is impos- sible. The question, how do individuals and groups react to changing insight into reality, can be answered only by psychology and sociology, not by logic. IV. PROGNOSIS DETERMINED BY PROGRAM It is obvious that a program is based on, and modified in the light of, analysis and prognosis, though not always logically. A pro- gram without prognosis is an impotent utopian dream. On the other hand, a prognosis without programs is necessarily incomplete. Prog- nosis depends upon programs in two distinct ways. First and obvi- ously, the programs of others are data for the social observer and theorist. What physical facts and events are to the natural scientist, that valuations, beliefs and programs, however wrong-headed or ill- conceived, are to the social scientist. Second, and perhaps less obvi- ously, the observer and theorist himself has something like a program which determines his analysis and prognosis. 6. Max Weber, Gesammelte Aufsdtze zur Soziologie und Sozialpolitik, p. 416.</page><page sequence="7">PROGRAMS AND PROGNOSES 361 A. Programs as Social Data Social analysis treats the intentions and plans of individuals and groups as the most important part of its data. We can forecast what is likely to happen under specified conditions only if we know what certain people will want to do under those conditions and how powerfully they will act. Not value systems in the abstract, not given sets of ends, but programs, in so far as they are backed by power, are an essential element in analysis and prognosis. An intense prognostic dispute has recently raged in Britain over the question of whether the removal of food subsidies would have inflationary or deflationary effects. Yet, the answer hinges almost entirely on the program and power of trade unions. If workers fix real wages successfully, money wages will rise and the effect will be inflationary. If they fix wages in money terms (either because they suffer from a "money illusion," or because they are relatively weak) the effect will be deflationary. B. Selection and Relevance The selection of empirical data relevant to any question under examination is subject to a judgment as to what ought to be admitted as good evidence. Factual propositions imply injunctions about what kind of events we should expect if we accept certain views about the real world, and valuations about the credit-worthiness of beliefs. Clearly these judgments are not moral or political value judgments (although they may be connected with these). A discus- sion of the nature of these judgments and rules is beyond the scope of this paper, but they appear to be in some respects like moral value judgments and imperatives. They, too, require a decision, and cannot be subsumed under clearly definable general canons. Above all, they cannot be derived from the facts, because there are no facts without them. Moreover, the element in these judgments which resembles value judgments is particularly prevalent in the social studies. Here evidence is scarce, situations are complex and often unique, and scientific experiment almost impossible. Hence the scope for appraisal and judgment is much wider than in many of the natural sciences. The importance of valuations in the formation of empirical hypotheses is brought out even more clearly when we consider probability prognoses in the form of statistical propositions. First, the decision as to what deviations in any given set of observations from a probability hypothesis should be considered as refuting this</page><page sequence="8">362 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS hypothesis, is quite independent of the observations, and determined entirely by the use to which we put the- hypothesis. The purpose of our investigation thus determines the decision to accept or reject an empirical theory. Second, when we are faced with a choice between alternative statistical prognoses, we require a program to select the best one. One such program is that formulated by Wald, which is equivalent to a Neumann-Morgenstern theorem in the theory of games, accord- ing to which we choose that hypothetical prognosis on which we are likely to lose least if it turns out to be false. Safety first bids us mini- mize the maximum of possible losses. By looking upon uncertain future natural events as if they were a partner in a game, we can apply the Neumann-Morgenstern strategy to the selection of empir- ical prognoses. Thus an evaluation of gains and losses is an essential prerequisite for prediction, where alternative probability hypotheses are available. In the words of R. B. Braithwaite, ". . . we cannot be good, or at least deliberately good, without being wise. The modern principles of statistical inference show that, vice versa, judgments of value are, in the last analysis, inextricably involved in choosing the best way to scientific knowledge: we cannot be wise without making judgements of good and evil."7 C. Models and Concepts: the Index Number Problem All concepts are abstractions. They are normative, not only in the sense much discussed recently, that they may have emotive connotations and may be used to persuade as well as to describe, but also in the more fundamental sense that a rule or judgment is required to determine what particular objects or experiences should be lumped together under any given concept. What is known in economics and statistics as the index number problem is a problem common to all thinking. But the difficulties become particularly glaring in the social sciences. Trouble arises when we mistake for concrete things what in fact are theories or models, and thus forget that there is usually a choice of alternative theories or models to explain a set of experiences. Examples of the muddles caused by this mistake are such models as "Man v. Nature," "Real Social Income," "Consumption," "the Economy," etc. A particularly apt example is the means-ends model itself. By arranging and presenting the facts in a certain way, policy questions are already implied, which would not have arisen if a different model had been chosen. (See section D.) 7. R. B. Braithwaite, "Moral Principles and Inductive Policies," Proceedings of the British Academy, XXXVI (1950), 65f.</page><page sequence="9">PROGRAMS AND PROGNOSES 363 The same is true of all important concepts in economics. To say anything, not merely about prices, real wages, national income, etc., but, e.g., about the economic consequences of the war, about the economic prospects of a country, almost anything about capital - ideas with normally little emotive content - implies nevertheless running up against the problem of choosing, hence valuing, although this fact is often concealed by our mistaking models for concrete objects. The literature is replete with declarations that comparisons between the utilities of different men cannot be made by positive economists because such comparisons are value judgments. Yet, by using appropriately question-begging pseudo-positive terms, i.e., models with implicit valuations disguised as descriptive concepts, the valuations reappear. Thus shortly after Jevons says solemnly: "there is never, in any single instance, an attempt made to compare the amount of feeling in one mind with that in another," (Theory of Political Economy, p. 14) he speaks ingenuously of aggregate and average psychological functions, belonging to groups of people, nations, or trading bodies, as if the impossible were possible after all. Similarly, modern welfare economists speak of increases in social income and welfare after having declared that interpersonal com- parisons of real income and welfare are impossible. In some instances it is, of course, possible to lay down a definite rule to eliminate ambiguity. But even then the decision will be guided by the purpose of our investigation, by the question we are asking. We shall be prepared to modify the rule according to what our interest requires. The point is that the concepts and propositions of even the most purely empirical investigation derive their meaning and significance from a purpose, an interest, and involve choice and, therefore, valuation. "National income" has no meaning, unless we specify whether we are interested in an underdeveloped or a developed society, in one with little or much state activity, in a nation's productive capacity, its standard of living, or its equality, etc. "Capital" has no meaning unless we know whether the inquirer is an accountant, a businessman, or a pure theorist who believes in equilibrium. Yet, many speak of "national income," "capital," etc., as if they were speaking of gallons of water. All this may sound too obvious to be worth saying. Yet the belief is widespread that we can confine ourselves to the discovery of facts and thus avoid choice and valuation.</page><page sequence="10">364 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS D. Inadequacy of the Means-Ends Schema In social analysis valuations enter not only at the ultimate (or initial) stage in decisions about sets of given ends, but at every stage. People do not attach value only to ultimate ends (whatever this may mean); and they are not indifferent between the means which pro- mote these ends, even where the means are technically and otherwise exactly equivalent. It is important to avoid a terminological confusion here. It is, of course, possible to define anything to which value is attached as an "end." But such a trick would not meet the purpose for which the means-ends dichotomy was constructed. As we have seen, it was meant to circumscribe a neutral sphere in which objective statements can be made, and into which no valuations enter. But if values are attached to means, the qualifications required by the acceptance of the ends become necessary at every stage. If end E can be brought about by courses a, b, and c, and if no direct values are attached to a, b, and c, a scientific discussion of these courses, which abstracts entirely from valuations, is possible: how long they take, how effec- tively they promote E, what other results E1, E2, etc., besides E they are likely to have, etc. It is then possible to arrive at the con- clusion, say, that a is the most effective course, if E is desired and if E1, E2, etc., are insufficient deterrents (or welcome by-products). This is the model commonly envisaged by practitioners of economics. But this procedure is no longer open if direct values are attached to a, b, and c themselves. For then we can only say, tautologically, choose a if you want a, choose b, if you want b, etc.; whereas before we could say, choose a, but not b or c, if you want E. Since the hypothetical clause referring to valuation has to be introduced at every stage, empirical analysis disappears altogether. The following quite unwarranted assumptions would be required if we were to discuss objectively means in relation to "given" ends: 1. People attach to means no direct value, but only instrumental value. 2. People attach to ends direct value only, and never consider them as means to other ends. 3. No other effects of means than the "given" ends have direct value. Very rarely can one reach exactly the same end by alternative, politically entirely indifferent, means. The means affect the "end" in the wider sense. Whereas the means-end model, to be useful, must assume that the same place can be reached by alternative paths (see p. 367), in fact different paths usually lead to different places in</page><page sequence="11">PROGRAMS AND PROGNOSES 365 this field. This fact greatly restricts the sphere in which prognosis can progress without assuming or committing itself to specific valua- tions almost all the time. It narrows the realm of "neutrality" and "objectivity," as defined by the means-ends protagonists. To illustrate: If consumption were the only end, and if produc- tion and exchange were only means to its achievement, certain rules about the optimum conditions of production and exchange could be laid down. The formulation of these rules has been the aim of an important branch of traditional welfare economics. But the disturb- ing fact is that neither the conditions in which production is carried on, nor the relationships generated by exchange are purely instru- mental. They are human conditions and human relations, which are valued as much as, and in some cases more strongly than, the end of consumption. Nor, of course, is consumption simply a given end. Not only are there good and bad ways of earning money, but there are also good and bad ways of spending it. The foregoing was an attempt to criticize the means-ends model in its own terminology. A different approach, pointing to the same conclusion, may bring out the argument more clearly.8 Somebody may at this stage of the argument reply: "Granted that problems of policy as a whole cannot be reduced to a means-ends model. Never- theless, means-ends problems are ubiquitous, though always involving abstractions from the total situation, and they are the only ones which an economist as such is competent to deal with. Furthermore, surely not all the deliverances of an economist will be policy deliver- ances. If so, how are the purely descriptive parts of his analysis related to the policy part?" Those who find the means-ends model helpful look upon problems of economic policy as if they were, in principle, like puzzles. There is the obvious difference that puzzles are constructed by some people in order to be solved by others, whereas problems of policy usually are not. But in both cases, granted consistent premises, there is always a "correct" solution. There is always an unambiguous "scientific" test of whether we have solved the puzzle. Thus if the end is, say, the avoidance of more than 2 per cent unemployment for five years, statisticians can tell us whether we have succeeded or not. No doubt, many problems of economic policy are of this type. If all policy problems were of this kind, not much more could be said in principle. Some people, perhaps the technocrats, believe 8. The following argument owes much to correspondence with Thomas D. Weldon. His views can now be found in his The Vocabulary of Politics (Baltimore: Penguin, 1953), esp. Chap. 3, section 7 and Chap. 5.</page><page sequence="12">366 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS that they are. It is certainly tempting to assimilate all problems to this type, and to say that a problem has been solved when certain ideal rules are obeyed. But the question, e.g., whether the avoidance of unemployment should be a primary objective of policy is altogether different. We might indeed say that absence of unemployment dimin- ishes the chances of social rebellion and is to be commended solely on this ground. Thus considered as a mere means, statisticians could presumably again tell us whether this is correct or not. Many ends are, at least partly, intermediate ends in this sense. And some theories maintain that all problems could be subsumed under one single ultimate end. But this is not a plausible view. If we believe that unemployment spells misery, loss of human dignity, and that it violates our belief in the brotherhood of men, but that some of it may at times be necessary to prevent greater evil, no simple criterion could be formulated, which would show whether, by avoiding unemployment, we have done the right thing. However, although we cannot apply simple and definite tests and present a "scientific" solution, the answer is not arbitrary. Through observa- tion, conversation, and experience we can learn to judge and appraise these matters. Although value judgments enter into our judgment of the situa- tion, they are not of the type of "ends" as in the puzzle-solving model. A good deal of political and economic discourse is neither purely descriptive, nor just rhetorical emotive persuasion, nor a combination of the two. It is more like the exercise of a skill, or an art, like playing the piano, or giving a lecture, or writing a poem. The strictly scientific aspect of political discussion, as defined by the means-ends dichotomists, is comparable to the theory of the skill: it lays down precise rules, clear tests. But the best theory can produce neither a skillful performance nor good judgment of a performance. A skillful performance can neither be tested by hard and fast standards, nor is it merely an arbitrary or subjective decision whether we judge it good or bad. An economist, like a novelist, is good not because (a) he knows the facts, and (b) has the right value judgments (political or literary). The answer to the question, "How do we know that he is a good economist or novelist?", whatever it may be (and it is not an easy one), will certainly not be, "Because his work follows certain definite canons." Analysis and prognosis and their appraisal are skills, which can- not always be subjected to the rules of the means-ends game. Although they inevitably involve judgments which have some of the char-</page><page sequence="13">PROGRAMS AND PROGNOSES 367 acteristics of valuations, they are not for that reason "subjective," arbitrary, or mere matters of taste. E. Implications for Welfare Economics There are, roughly speaking, two modern versions of welfare economics, the Paretian and the Bergsonian, Both versions depend, to some extent, on the validity of the means-ends model. The Paretian optimum conditions of production and exchange are claimed to be - in the more modest formulations - necessary, though not sufficient, conditions for an economic optimum, on certain additional assumptions which it is not necessary to discuss here. If the puzzle-solving model is rejected, according to which recom- mendations of means become a merely technical matter, and if the more empirical approach suggested in the previous section is adopted, it becomes pointless to speak of a social or of an economic optimum which is achieved if certain specifiable conditions are fulfilled; and yet it is meaningful and important to speak of improvements. But only if we are prepared to speak of an "optimum" are the Paretian conditions necessary conditions (on certain assumptions). If we reject the applicability of an "optimum," it is perfectly possible, even granted the stringent assumptions about values and facts of this theory, to envisage all kinds of improvements which do not meet the Paretian criteria. All desirable redistributions of wealth which would not allow compensation of the losers would be such improvements. The Pareto criteria would turn out to be not only insufficient, but also unnecessary. Similarly, the social welfare function is a device which makes an ordering of all possible states necessary. Given a social welfare function, the solution of the optimum is like the solution of a puzzle though it may require great technical virtuosity. But no social welfare function is ever given, at any rate in a democratic society. We never order all possible total situations according to a system of values, but have rather muddled preferences for aspects and features of a limited number of actual and possible situations. These preferences change as a result of the discussion about, and the adoption of, policies intended to minister to them. If the economist is to give advice in concrete situations, it is more helpful for him to think in terms of improvements than in terms of ideals or optima. Nobody really knows what an optimum eco- nomic system is like, but many can make wise proposals for better- ment. The fallacy of the means-end pattern of thinking lies in the belief that "improvement" always logically implies an "optimum" or</page><page sequence="14">368 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS "ideal." It may, if we judge the change with reference to a given ideal, such as the number of correct answers in a quiz where the only alternatives are "Yes" or "No." But "improvement" need not imply "optimum," as may be illustrated in the example of writing a good article. An article is never completed; there is always scope for improvement. Nobody can lay down criteria and say: "This is what the end-product ought to be like." Yet, it would be foolish to deny that there are ways of knowing when it has been improved. The mistake of fitting the "good article" into the quiz schema is analogous to the mistake of fitting all economic policies into the means-ends pattern. F. Ideologies So far we have discussed some of the ways in which analysis and prognosis depend upon and presuppose judgments, valuations, and programs, without, however, necessarily being distorted thereby. But there are numerous interpretations of facts in social theory whose function it is not to clear up muddles or to show up inconsist- encies, but, on the contrary, to justify inconsistent beliefs, to bridge over contradictions. Many well-known types of social prognosis are biased in a more or less conscious way, so as to justify valuations and the behavior that springs from them. When contradictions within a program, or between the program and certain facts, are pointed out, two reactions are possible: Either the program is altered in accordance with fuller, more rational under- standing, or the belief about the facts is adjusted to fit the program. Prognoses that are used to justify programs in this manner may be manifestations of "blind spots," prejudices, biases, or, more grandi- osely, ideologies. The distortion may range from blatant lies to the very categories of thought, which, if the sociologists of knowledge are right, are conditioned by our interests and valuations. At this stage, the philosophies of natural law and of utilitarianism are turned upside down. According to these two philosophies, values and rules can be derived from a contemplation of the facts, the natural order according to the former, happiness or welfare according to the latter. But today we are more inclined to believe that it is possible, and perhaps inevitable, that our values and rules determine the manner in which we approach, see, arrange, and interpret, the facts. It is not so much that values follow from "the nature of the case," as that what we believe to be the nature of the case follows from our values. Although in some cases a rational examination of political ideas may make them more effective by grounding them on a better knowl-</page><page sequence="15">PROGRAMS AND PROGNOSES 369 edge of the facts, in other cases rational or rather pseudo-rational examination makes them into sterile ideologies. But their power over the irrational nature of men may be thereby increased. One of the most important facts of social life is that people are often highly irrational. The critics of abstract, rationalistic systems in economics have, for over a hundred years, pointed out the historical and political value premises which underlie this type of theorizing; without, however, clarifying where they seek the Archimedic point from which to lift their own theory - the institutional or historical criticism - beyond ideology. It appears that the way towards a bias-free study of economics lies in the awareness of one's historical, political, institu- tional and moral valuations, and thus in an open recognition of the limitations of any theory, including one's own. Paradoxically, by abandoning the claim to absolutism, universality, and "pure" science, a way is opened to a more limited but also more rational, to a more modest but also more objective, approach to the study of society. V. INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN PROGRAM AND PROGNOSIS It appears therefore that programs are modified in the light of prognoses, but prognoses also depend upon, and are altered with, changing programs. Valuations depend on what changes we believe to be feasible. But the "constants" which determine what is feasible may in turn be altered by people's valuations. Faith can move mountains. It is therefore impossible to take either the ends, in so far as they enter into programs, as "given" independently of the analysis of means, or to postulate a "pure" analysis of means, a science of social engineering. Programs depend on prognoses, which in turn depend on programs, etc. It has been said that public knowledge of Keynesian analysis removes the world which Keynes analyzed, and that successful practice of Marxism removes the conditions to which Marxian analysis applies. In the following I shall try to give a few illustrations of the way in which prognosis alters programs, the transformation of which in turn modifies prognosis. A. Prophecies: Cure through Prognosis Prognosis may serve the program of changing the way of life (the programs) of others. The oldest illustrations of this are the reform endeavors of the prophets of the Old Testament. Jonah's prognosis was the destruction of Nineveh in forty days. God's pro- gram for Jonah was not to make him into a successful forecaster, but to mend the ways of the people of Nineveh. As a result of</page><page sequence="16">370 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Jonah's prognosis, this program was achieved. Incidentally, Jonah's prognosis was falsified, which may have contributed to his anger. In the same tradition of cure through prognosis stand the inter- pretations of history of Hegel, Marx, Spengler, and perhaps Toynbee. In some cases the cure lies in the fulfilment of the prognosis (Hegel, Marx), in others it lies in its falsification (Spengler, Toynbee). These interpretations contain analysis and prognosis, which are both determined by, and, in turn, determine social programs. The prognosis need not be guided primarily by the intention of improvement, but may have that effect nevertheless. The studies of Booth and Rowntree stated certain facts about poverty in England. As a result of this knowledge, consciences were stirred into action. But the methods which were taken to alleviate poverty, together with the general rise in the standard of living, led to a new inter- pretation of poverty. The poverty line, i.e., the standard condemned by public opinion, rose with rising living standards. Or, to put the matter another way, analysis and action to relieve poverty brought out a new aspect of poverty: it was considered to lie not merely in destitution, i.e., inability to afford the physically essential minimum, but also in inequality. Poverty, it has become clear, is partly relative, though not entirely, for it is possible for all to be equally poor. The idea of what constitutes poverty has changed as a result of inquiring into poverty and of attempting to reduce it. Other examples of the same process are the studies of the condi- tions of Negroes in the United States, in particular Gunnar Myrdal's An American Dilemma; Ferguson's and Cunnison's study of juvenile delinquency in Glasgow,9 and reports on living conditions in poor countries. B. Dangerous Thought: Destruction through Prognosis In other instances prognosis has the effect of destroying some of the values, and hence some of the social relations, upon which it is based. This is often neither foreseen nor desired by the prognosti- cators. Indeed, proposals based on prognosis often fail to produce the intended results, just because the prognosis alters the data on which it is based. A simple illustration would be those theories that assume the "money illusion" on the part of wage earners. The latter are sup- posed to object to a reduction in money wages while prices are con- stant, but not to a rise in prices with wages constant. Such a theory in itself may make workers more real-wage conscious. 9. T. Ferguson and J. Cunnison, The Young Wage-Earner: A Study of Glasgow Boys (London: Oxford University Press, 1951).</page><page sequence="17">PROGRAMS AND PROGNOSES 371 There is an element of erosion in almost all growth of knowledge on social relations. A good deal of our behavior is habitual, semi- instinctive, subject to taboos and conventions. Analysis, which is based on the assumption that people behave in this way, brings taboos and conventions into the open, increases people's awareness of them, and leads to the desire of conscious manipulation. But the manipulation destroys the fabric on which, according to the initial prognosis, it is supposed to work. The price for eating of the tree of knowledge is the loss of Paradise. Some objections to too much knowledge of the working of one's psyche have been raised on those grounds. In economics, the knowl- edge of the irrational, quasi-conventional character of competition led to monopolistic agreements; knowledge of the outwardly imposed rules of the gold standard game led to a desire of every nation to be master of its own fate; and generally, greater awareness of the net- work of economic relations led to a desire to manipulate it, and thus to its disintegration. Increased organization by individuals and groups led to increased disorganization at large. The social effects of birth control, of divorce, of control of prop- erty, markets, prices, currencies, and the use of propaganda, all result from growing knowledge and sophistication. The automatic adjustments of liberal society presupposed acceptance of traditional behavior, and absence of the desire to question, experiment, and control rationally. Successful prognosis seemed to make it unneces- sary to adjust ourselves to the world, and created the desire to adjust the world to our desires. But the cumulative effect was to produce an altogether new social situation, adjustment to which is more problematic than ever. We have seen above that Marxist theory, like prophecy, is a prognosis intended to create action. The theory and practice of modern state planning, on the other hand, is an attempt to meet the disintegrating pulls of a growing number of increasingly self-conscious, rational planning units. (Some of these pulls are themselves state interventions). It is possible to draw different conclusions from this tendency. Some might argue that "too much knowledge is a bad thing." There are various versions of the Japanese concept of "dangerous thought," and almost every society attempts to protect itself to some extent by restricting open discussion of its most sacred institutions. Others might argue that the trend is both inevitable and desirable. What is required is more knowledge, i.e., knowledge that takes these socially disintegrating effects of partial knowledge into account. But these questions are not my concern here.</page><page sequence="18">372 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS C. Harmony through Prognosis In many theories a fuller understanding of the facts is believed to lead to greater social harmony. This is obviously so in all theories which consider evil as a form of ignorance. But although many believe implicitly in such a theory, few do so now when it is stated explicitly. Yet, it is clear that knowledge may contribute to social harmony, and often does. It can remove opposition based on false views about reality, and a good deal of opposition does in fact have this origin. It can bring out more clearly the implications of commonly accepted standards;' and it can help to contribute to the formulation of com- mon standards (respect for honest research, tolerance, etc.). In many situations, even where short-term interests clash, it can he shown that it is in everybody's interest to co-operate, because large potential gains could thereby be realized, out of which all members to the agreement could benefit.2 A whole complex theory of welfare economics has been constructed on this argument. On the other hand, fuller knowledge may also sharpen conflicts. Harmony may rest on muddled thinking, and conflicts may be brought to light by clarification. In particular, the reluctance to make sacrifices to achieve accepted objectives may be increased. Everybody wants peace, full employment, happiness and prosperity for all. But not everybody is prepared to do all that is required to achieve these goals. Moreover, knowledge of appropriate means gives power. Given divergent values, a clearer view on policies may therefore sharpen conflicts. Programs backed by knowledge will be more powerful and, for those who do not share them, more dangerous. Public opinion polls are a simple illustration of how a certain kind of knowledge (viz., of other people's opinions) may either 1. For a recent expression of this view see Milton Friedman, in A Sirvey of Contemporar? Economics, II, 456: "I venture the judgment that currently in the Western world, and especially in the United States, differences about eco- nomic policy among disinterested citizens derive predominantly from different predictions about the consequences of taking action, differences that can in principle be eliminated by the progress of positive economics - rather than from fundamental differences in basic values, differences about which men can ultimately only fight." 2. This, of course, is the classical argument for the greatest happiness principle, for free trade, etc. In commenting on his terms of trade argument for the imposition of a tariff, Edgeworth quoted with approval a remark by J. S. Nicholson that some demonstrations are "part of the casuistry of economics, like the discussions of moral philosophers concerning the occasional justification of mendacity. Free trade, like honesty, is still the best policy." R. W. Stevens, "New Ideas in International Trade Theory," American Economic Review, June 1951, p. 375 note.</page><page sequence="19">PROGRAMS AND PROGNOSES 373 increase or reduce agreement. Knowledge as to how votes are dis- tributed may make some people switch their votes to the majority, and may induce others to back a minority. To say more about the relation between social knowledge and social harmony would require specific sociological assumptions. Here it must suffice to note that totalitarian philosophies postulate a single rigid program which must not be subject to modifications. Prognosis will tend to take the form of ideology: it will not show up, but rather will plaster over cracks in the analysis in order to justify the program. But this view is not confined to totalitarian philosophies. Pro- grams that cannot be modified by prognosis are to be found in any utopian system of political theory. The means-ends pattern fits best into these views. According to the liberal doctrine of the ulti- mate harmony of interests, either in its natural law version or as utilitarianism, conflicts result from ignorance, knowledge must promote harmony. But closer inspection shows that the harmony aspect of these theories is in fact ideology. They are usually the formulation of the aspirations of a particular group (exporters, manufacturers, e.g., advocating free trade) put forward as in the general interest. Ideo- logical concepts such as utilities, pleasures, social income, etc., are used in order to postulate a harmony where in fact there is conflict. In times of crisis or war, even in a political democracy, the situation of a single, generally agreed, program is approximated, and the means-ends dichotomy becomes a plausible assumption. But in a democratic society, in times of peace and at least moderate pros- perity, programs and the power behind them are conflicting and dispersed; and prognoses and programs become intricately inter- connected in a way which cannot be fitted into the means-end pattern. In a society that values independent research and pro- grams based on this research, and in which knowledge is widely disseminated, prevailing programs will be modified in the direction of greater efficiency and consistency, though not necessarily greater harmony. As a result, probable future social trends are altered and prognoses will have to be modified. In the light of this revised knowledge, programs will again be altered, some tensions will be resolved, others created. All groups will be aware of the possibility that their programs may have to be altered by new situations, and that they must be limited by the aspirations of others. Dictatorial programs may be justly reflected in a means-end pattern. But democratic programs</page><page sequence="20">374 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS are piecemeal, empirical, and elastic. The means-end pattern does not fit them. D. Speculation and Oligopoly The strictly economic activities which illustrate this inter- dependence most clearly are speculation and oligopoly. The pro- gram here is to make profits. The prognosis is the intentions and the behavior of others (rival speculators, or rival sellers). Every sound speculator and oligopolist takes into account the manner in which the expectations of others (their prognoses) are affected by the intentions of others (their programs), including his own. A's prognosis, hence A's program, is a function of B's, C's, D's, etc., prognoses and programs, B's prognosis and program are a function of A's, C's, D's, etc., and so on. Any prognosis affects programs, and any program affects prognoses. Policies are sensible if certain facts are true; but whether they are true depends on whether people pursue certain policies. VI. THE TASK OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES What follows from all this with respect to the task of the social scientist? It does not follow that social science is impossible, or that it must plunge at once into valuations and ideologies. On the contrary. To be useful and truthful, the social scientist, and in particular the economist, should start with actual political attitudes of people, or groups of people, not with their rationalizations and pseudo-theoretical ideologies. He should abandon speculation about "general welfare," "maximum satisfactions," etc., for at least two reasons: first, because these concepts have no clear implications and lend themselves easily to implicit interpretations and persuasive definitions; second, because, even if they had clear implications, actual concrete valuations are not concerned with them at all. Concrete valuations in concrete historical situations, or in possible situations that might arise, and the attitudes which reflect them, should form the starting point of analysis. Political programs are not good enough. They too contain empty rationalizations such as "general welfare"; and they are conditioned by the desire to reach "agreed formulae" and gloss over disagreement. Neither the party programs in the United States, nor those of the parties in Britain would provide a sufficiently concrete basis for analysis. On the other hand, the social scientist must not "go behaviorist" either. The observed behavior of groups in actual situations is not a sufficient guide to the formulation of concrete political attitudes. It is certainly a partial way of discovering attitudes, but it does not tell the whole story. The relevant attitudes to be discovered</page><page sequence="21">PROGRAMS AND PROGNOSES 375 must also refer to readiness to act in certain ways in the future, and under different conditions. And since these potential reactions cannot be deduced logically from present reactions, an altogether different method suggests itself. It is the task of social or group psychology to attempt to unify group reactions under something which is analo- gous to character or personality in individual psychology. No anthropomorphism is involved here if it is possible to discover and predict regularities and unity in the reactions of groups to different actual and potential situations. The political attitudes thus mapped out can then yield value premises which are sufficiently concrete to be used for analysis and prognosis. To map out this unity is obviously not a matter of looking for "given" welfare functions, sets of ends, etc. It is more like the exer- cise of artistic imagination and sympathetic understanding than like solving puzzles, though puzzle-solving will have a part to play. The conclusions of Section IV D are thus confirmed: problems of economic policy have a good deal in common with problems of artistic workmanship, as well as with problems of engineering. Some of the difficulties discussed in the preceding sections would still remain, in particular: 1. Values are attached to means, and to incidental consequences, as well as to ends. 2. It may still be difficult to separate professed valuations from actual ones. 3. The transition must be made from valuations derived from false beliefs about reality to valuations derived from correct beliefs. Thus ideology may creep into the theory of the personality, or the character of groups. Since the unity of group personality is neither one of deductive logic nor one of complete observation, but partly at least one of intuitive understanding, the scope for bias and controversy is enlarged. Yet an inadequate theory based on a correct view of social attitudes seems preferable to a logically per- fect theory based on an altogether false view, i.e., the means-ends dichotomy. The growing complexity of social life, and the increasing impor- tance of controlling groups, such as monopolies, public corporations, trade unions, planning bodies of various types, etc., whose activities are replacing the more conventional and automatic adjustments of the past, make it more important to study the valuations that underlie the actions of these bodies. In this analysis account should be taken of the probable reception of new theories and their social repercussions. Once we have mapped out the valuations of different groups in</page><page sequence="22">376 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS society, two types of interconnected study can be pursued. First, one might pose the question: what policies are appropriate to these concrete valuations? And second: what social factors determine the formation and the strength of these valuations? It will be necessary to revise continually the results of the inquiry into one of these two questions in the light of the results of the other. VII. SUMMARY Analysis and prognosis cannot be neutral, in the sense that they belong to a sphere of actual and possible causal relations which can be permanently separated from valuations and the programs which they inspire. 1. Analysis and prognosis presuppose programs in the sense of interests which determine selection and appraisal of evidence. To ignore this side of the picture is analogous to adhering to naive empiricism in the theory of knowledge. 2. The relation between analysis and policy, and that between prognosis and program, cannot always be adequately analyzed in terms of means and ends. The application of analysis to policy is a matter of skill, not one of subsumption under given canons. 3. Modern welfare economics, in both its Paretian and Berg- sonian versions, misapplies the means-ends model to social situations. It thus mistakenly holds that "optima" must be sought where "improvements" are appropriate and logically sufficient, and that valuations must be "given" from outside, although in fact they may result from empirical appraisals. 4. Analysis and prognosis may harbor ideologies. They may be formulated in a manner which does not bring out the facts, but which rather attempts to reconcile conflicts in beliefs and valuations. Awareness of his own valuations, and of the limitations to a claim of validity, are among the theorist's safeguards against falling into the ideological trap. 5. Although analysis and prognosis must take the actual or possible beliefs and valuations of people as data, by analyzing them and bringing them into the open, they tend to change them. A fuller analysis and prognosis will take cognizance of these changes, but the interconnection is a continuous process. Prognosis must therefore be subject to continuous revision. 6. Social scientists should attempt to base their prognoses on concrete actual or potential valuations of groups in concrete situa- tions. An understanding of the unity of complex attitudes is the task of social psychology or sociology. PAUL STREETEN. BALLIOL COLLEGE OXFORD</page></plain_text>
