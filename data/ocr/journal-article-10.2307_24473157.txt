<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT In this vast, spectacular, bizarre, and excruciatingly detailed exhibition, there was another, even more compelling exhibition struggling to get out. I'll get to that later, but at the outset it is important to say that this is one of those historical exhibitions of photography, not pegged to a particular artist, that only the French seem willing or able to do on such a scale. They really take this stuff seriously. In this case, the haunted house was the Maison Europeenne de la Photographie in Paris, with its beautiful exhibition space near the Marais. This show (titled "Le Troisieme Oeil" in French) of 123 images (actually more, since many were multiframe) is slated for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but one imagines that it will first be put on a weight-loss program for an American audience with its smaller appetite for the outre. The subject is one of the most marginal in photography but, as with so many "other pictures" (vernacular collector Thomas Walther's phrase), it is emerging from the shadows. So-called spirit photography comprehends the bogus, the accidental, and the deeply weird. It is a "documentary" genre that attended the rise of spiritualism (belief in the ability to contact the dead), first in the United States after the Civil War and later in Europe. Its heyday was the turn of the last century up to the 1920s, when scientists and famous writers, among others, enthusiastically attended seances. But as this show hints, the impulse to seize hold of spirits is very much with us still. Indeed, it lies at the heart of photography's appeal. I should confess early on my own positivist, "reality-based" bias. I do not believe that the living and the dead can physically communicate. If there is a poignancy to these photographs, it lies precisely in the unbridgeable distance they describe between this side of life and the other. As Geoffrey Batchen has pointed out, photography came into existence in large part as an expres sion of cultural desire, and desire (including the desire for profit) motivated these seekers after the unseen. The dates of the photographs betray the forces that were at work: an expanding domain of empirical science and Darwinian theory was encroach ing on the territory of traditional Christian belief, even as Ameri cans began to get their first taste of total warfare, of unredeemed death. One of the earliest spirit photographs (alas, not in the show) depicts Mary Todd Lincoln surrounded by the ghost of her assassinated husband. A spiritual void was opening up, and many strange things rushed in to fill it, including photography. The photographs in the show involve several types of ghostly experiences: "actual" spirits (usually created by double expo sures or by the temporary presence of a subject during a long exposure, just long enough to leave a photographic trace); table turnings, levitations, and other spirit interventions; ectoplasmic manifestations; auras; and "thought photographs." Of the first two categories, it suffices to ask what sort of "evidence" people thought they were seeing. Adolphe-Eugene Disderi seemed to parody the idea early (1859) in a sequence of cartes de visite in which one of the subjects, the Vicomte de Renneville, disappears, only to return in a subsequent frame as a blurred spirit dressed in an antique helmet, shoes, stockings, and nothing else. The whole thing could have been lifted from Duane Michals. The levitation of the medium Colin Evans looks like someone being tossed into a temperance-society mosh pit. 18 / www. aperture, org THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT</page><page sequence="2">By far the most peculiar images here are those of ectoplasmic manifestations. Historically, these came later, in the 1910s and '20s, after spiritualism had developed a more elaborate bag of tricks, physics had revealed the impersonal nature of the uni verse, and art had moved toward abstraction. Ectoplasm was desire shorn of anthropomorphism, thus more scientistic, as inchoate as the id, which had recently been discovered by Freud. It oozes from noses, mouths, and ears of mediums, even crawls from out of nowhere like a rubber hand toward the nether parts of one splayed female medium. I was relieved to encounter a section of the exhibition with photographs revealing the springs and levers of mediumistic performance. Thank goodness, it was all just an illusion. Yet much bogus imagery was redeemed for me by what seemed to be the heart of the show. This was the category designated as "fluid photography." The medium in question was not a person but reality itself. The photographs were attempts to capture the fugitive traces of the energies of things, whether electrical, magnetic, or spiritual. Here the image of a severed hand giving off the last spark of telltale life (probably heat) sits comfortably next to Kirlian "aura" photographs of the 1970s—a technique for capturing electric fields created by living bodies. Most of the photographs in this section of the show are beautifully abstract, and recall a fundamental paradox of photography. Although from its inception, it colonized experience under the banner of the visual, the nature of that seeing was not known. Could photog raphy offer evidence of things unseen? Did it not possibly open doorways to the invisible? Many thought so, from Julia Margaret Cameron to August Strindberg to Edward Steichen to the Futurist Anton Giulio Bragalia. And even the Modernists had their photo grams and Rayograms to explore chance and other uncodified aspects of reality. The other exhibition struggling to be born from this womb of spirits is, of course, one that addresses how Modernist photogra phy arose out of an ambivalent modernity, and beyond that, how the invisible connections were forged to the art of our time, from Simen Johan's childhood fantasies to Tracey Moffatt's gothic tableaux to Adam Fuss's series "My Ghost." These affiliations were sketched out in the 2003 exhibition "The Disembodied Spirit," at the Bowdoin College Museum of Art. They suggest that William Henry Fox Talbot's original description of photography as "a little bit of magic realized" remains alluring and not merely metaphorical, but true. © —Lyle Rexer "Le Troisieme Oeil"/"The Perfect Medium" was presented at Paris's Maison Europeenne de la Photographie, November 3, 2004-February 6, 2005 and subsequently at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, September 27 December 31, 2005.
