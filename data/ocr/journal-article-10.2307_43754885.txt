MM AND DAVE The inventor Max and the inventive Dave built a cartoon industry, W Max Fleischer was born in Austria in 1885 and came to the United States at the age of five. After some training in art and mechanics at the Art Students' League, Cooper Union, and the Mechanics and Tradesmen's School, Max sought em- ployment at the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. It is said that he offered to pay the Art Editor two dollars a week for the training: the startled editor hired him on the spot. Max left the Eagle, and after several years as a photo engraver, returned to jour- nalism as the Art Editor of Popular Science Monthly, which allowed him to pursue his mechanical and artistic interests. Encour- aged by Waldemar Kaempffert, the Editor-in-Chief, Max, with his brother Dave, attempted to develop a method to facilitate the production of motion picture cartoons by machinery, in order to cut the costs and improve the motion of anima- tion. The result of their experimentation was the rotoscope, which projected a film of a live figure frame-by-frame, serving as a guide for the drawing of an animated figure. In 1915, the Fleischers had completed their first cartoon by this new method. The film, one hundred and seventy-five feet in length, starred Ko-Ko the Clown, a roto- scoped version of Dave Fleischer in a clown suit. Cartoon in hand, Max went out in search of a distributor, and found John Bray, his erstwhile colleague on the Eagle, whose studio was the exclusive producer of cartoons for Paramount Famous Lasky. Bray hired the Fleischers to produce a series of short cartoons that featured Ko- Ko, but the First World War interrupted the association. In ,1917, the Army established a film studio at Fort Sill to produce training films. Max enlisted in the army, and due to a series of articles he had previously done on military equipment for Popular Scietice, he was assigned the direction of a series of training films. These animated films, how TO READ AN ARMY MAP and HOW TO FIRE A lewis gun (both 1917), may have been the first educational cartoons, although Bray has a similar claim. Dave spent the war in Washington, editing films for the Medical Corps. After the end of the war, Max and Dave returned to the Bray Studio, until 1921, when they began to release their "Out of the Inkwell" cartoons through Winkler, then Standard, Arrow, and Red Seal Pictures. Modeling, an early "Out of the Ink- well" cartoon (1921), begins, as usual, with Max at his drawing board. He sketches circles that form themselves into the shape of Ko-Ko the Clown, who complains that he is weak because Max uses stale ink. Max demands that the clown show more pep, and prods him into action with a sharp pen. As Ko-Ko cavorts, we see another part of the studio, where Dave is modeling a likeness of an ugly client in clay. The model complains that the bust looks too much like him, and Max, after drawing a winter scene into Ko-Ko' s world, goes to arbitrate the dispute. Ko-Ko, left alone, slips along the ice, but regains his balance and skates confidently off screen, sticking out his tongue at us. He reappears over the horizon, and traces a caricature of the model on the ice. A polar bear steals Ko-Ko's hat, and after a long chase, Ko-Ko rolls the bear up into a giant snowball, which he molds into the likeness of the model. The three men are angered by this dis- play, so Ko-Ko takes refuge in the sculp- ture. Max, Dave, and the model are hor- rified by the subsequent behavior of the bust's nose, as it begins to crawl along the floor. Terrified, they jump on the piece of clay, but Ko-Ko escapes to the drawing board. The men fight until Max realizes who is to blame. Ko-Ko sees this, and jumps back into the safety of the inkwell. In revenge, Max pours out the ink in sym- bolic filicide. In modeling, the Fleischers tried to solve two of the early problems of anima- tion: elaborate movement, and the illusion of depth. Through the use of the roto- scope, Ko-Ko was able to move in an elaborate and smooth manner through a live set. The Fleischers reveled in the free- dom their invention gave them, keeping their silent cartoons in almost constant mo- tion. modeling illustrates significant themes in the Fleischers' work. The ani- mated characters move without necessary cause, and often in a rhythmic pattern. This movement is not limited to change in location. Many things in the film change their shape or properties, such as the drawn circles that transform themselves into the living Ko-Ko, or the nose of the sculpture that crawls like a worm along the floor. These constant transformations run throughout the Fleischer silents. In bedtime (1921), Ko-Ko grows gigantic, and stalks, Kong-like, through the streets of New York. In ko-ko's haunted house (1928), the inkwell is stretched into a model house, and Ko-Ko's pet dog Fitz turns himself inside out. In harem scarum (1928), the chopped-off heads of Ko-Ko and Fitz sprout legs and walk back to their bodies. The Fleischer cartoon world is one in which everything is potentially some- thing else, with a resultingly bizarre imag- ery that finds its fullest expression in the cartoons of the early Thirties. The plots of most early Fleischer car- toons are cyclical and fatalistic.

More usually, Ko-Ko's fate is dictated by Max, his father-tormentor; the cartoon shows how the clown both tempts fate and struggles against it. In ko-ko's haunted house, Ko-Ko and Fitz are tormented by an animator who rings a gong and blows air into their model house. The characters ask Max for help, and he draws hundreds of Ko-Kos, which frighten the animator out of the studio. At times, the conflict between the real and comic worlds grows increasingly vio- lent. In KO-KO's EARTH CONTROL (1927), Ko-Ko and Fitz come to a shed, they play with the controls, and Fitz attempts to pull a lever marked "Danger! Do not touch earth control. If the handle is pulled, the world will come to an end." Despite Ko-Ko's desperate interference, Fitz suc- ceeds, and the cartoon world begins to crumble. The two characters jump out of the drawing to the supposed safety of the Fleischers' office window sill. Much to their surprise, they see that the real world is also being destroyed, as the ground shakes, and time runs backwards. Hor- rified, Ko-Ko and Fitz jump back into the inkwell, leaving the world in a state of chaos. The filmed process of drawing Ko-Ko at the beginning of almost every silent car- toon shows a Fleischer fascination with mechanics and processes that is evident in other ways. In ko-ko the hot shot (1924), Max is shown flipping through a stack of eels; in ko-ko's earth control, we see a cartoon explanation of how nature is con- trolled. Much of this fascination probably originated with Max, whose interest in mechanics brought him to animation, led him to patent more than a dozen anima- tion processes, and was to lead the Flei- schers to make a number of historically significant films in the Twenties. The Fleischers' interest in educational films did not end after their short Army film experience. In 1922, Max attempted a four-reel animated explanation of the EINSTEIN THEORY OF RELATIVITY (1923). This first-ever animated feature was played primarily for schools, and was so completely forgotten that a publicity sheet issued by the Fleischer Studio in 1938 neg- lected to mention it. the einstein theory of relativity was followed by a partly animated feature, evolution (1925), a minor sensation, made the same year as the Scopes Monkey Trial. An even more significant achievement followed. In 1924, the Fleischers, working with Dr. Lee DeForest of the DeForest Phonofilm Company, produced the first sound-on-film cartoon, oh mabel. In its first public showing, the audience refused to watch the feature until the cartoon was rerun. Oh mabel was the first of the "Song Car-Tunes," which were more generally distributed in silent versions. However, the sound prints were true synchronized sound films. In my old kentucky home (1926), a dog repairs his false teeth, plays a trombone, and requests that the audience sing along and "follow the bouncing ball," all in perfect synch. Generally, the "Song Car-Tunes" were cheaply animated in comparison with the "Out of the Inkwell" films. Most began with a stock clip of Ko- Ko and the Ko-Ko K war tette, who would introduce the song. Then the lyrics would roll by, accompanied by the now- famous Bouncing Ball. The last few choruses of the song would have a cartoon character re- place the ball, and perform amusing ac- tions as it jumped from word to word. Today, the films seem overlong with their endless choruses, but are still imaginative and funny. The "Song Car-Tunes," although popu- lar, were made only until 1926. The Red Seal Picture Corporation, never a finan- cially stable company, had undergone a number of changes of management, end- ing with Max Fleischer as president. De- spite publicity tours, and the introduction of the new live-action two-reel series "Keep 'Em Guessing" and "Carrie of the Chorus," the company closed in Sep- tember 1926, and the Fleischers were without a distributor. In 1927, the Fleischers released ko-ko plays pool through Paramount, an associ- ation that was to last for fifteen years. At first, the Fleischers produced a series of si- lent "Inkwell Imps" cartoons with Ko-Ko, but with the immmense popularity of Disney's talkies, Max and Dave returned to sound cartoons. The sidewalks of new york (1929), a "Screen Song," was the Fleischers' first sound cartoon for Paramount, and marked a return to the "bouncing ball" format of the "Song Car-Tunes." Paramount pro- vided the records or film clips, and the animators, working under Dave's direc- tion, would devise cartoon action to ac- company the music. Often, as in i'll be GLAD WHEN YOU'RE DEAD YOU RASCAL YOU (1932), they would incorporate animated characters into previously filmed live se- quences. This use of pre-recorded material was closer to today's animation methods than was the early Disney method of post-recording. At first, there was no story department at the Reischers' studio. Max and Dave, as producer and director, would receive re- cordings from Paramount, and would de- cide on a rough action outline or theme. Then Dave would go to work with the FILM COMMENT 49</page><page sequence="3">Top to bottom: Popeye's film debut in POPEYE THE SAILOR; Popeye hangs precariously from a girder in DREAM WALKING; skull-rock background in POPEYE THE SAILOR MEETS SINBAD THE SAILOR; Popeye, Olive, and Wimpy in POPEYE THE SAILOR MEETS ALI BABA'S FORTY THIEVES. We are grateful to Ivy Films, the exclusive dis- tributors of all the Betty Boop cartoons, for their generosity in furnishing prints for this piece. MAX &amp; DAVE FLEISHER CONTINUED animators. The animators were divided into units, each unit working on a different cartoon. The head animators would listen to the music with Dave, and would devise the action of the film, subject to Dave's ap- proval. This gave the head animators more freedom than the Disney animators, but not as much as the animators at Warners were to have. The new sound series was far better animated than the first, but marked the decline of Ko-Ko the Clown, who was quickly losing his popularity to Mickey Mouse. The "Inkwell Imps" silents ended in 1929, and were replaced by the "Talkar- toon" series. Max appeared less frequently in the films, and Ko-Ko was joined by Bimbo, a more anthropomorphic dog than Fitz. Bimbo's presence failed to restore the series to the success of earlier silent Ko-Ko's. In August 1930, the Fleischers intro- duced a new character, developed with animator Grim Natwick, called Betty Boop, who first appeared as a dog-like character in the "Talkartoon" dizzy dishes (1930). In 1931, after advertising for a girl "with a cute voice," the Fleischers hired Mae Questel to provide the Helen Kane- ish voice for the ne'y character. Questel's voice first appeared in betty co-ed (1931), which opens with Betty Boop as she is carried by cheering college students. We see Bimbo walking to Betty's door with flowers and candy. He is seized by two fraternity men, who bounce him into the air with a blanket. Bimbo falls into a tree, which comes to life and deposits the hap- less dog at the fraternity door. After a live-action sequence of Rudy Vallee sing- ing the title song, Bimbo gets to see Betty, and a number of shots give a satirical view of college graduation. Betty co-ed illustrates the weakness of many of the "Screen Songs." The live- action sequence in the middle of the car- toon disturbs its kinetic pace. The film just stops while Vallee sings, although it may not have seemed so to theater audiences who joined him in song. Also, at this time, the Betty Boop character was not yet fully formed, being awkwardly half-woman, half- dog. As in other Fleischer cartoons, there is a tremendous sense of fatalism in betty co-ed. Bimbo cannot get to Betty through his own attempts, but is brought to her by chance. He is tormented by fraternity members and struggles with an an- thropomorphic tree in an expression of vio- lence and mutability. Betty co-ed also contains strongly sexual elements. Not all of the early sound Fleischer car- toons were psychodramas. Some were re- vues, composed of a number of loosely- related sight gags and musical numbers. Betty boop m.d. (1932) has Betty and friends in a medicine show, selling Jippo. The cartoon is a dance of metamorphosis and death as various characters drink Jippo. An old man drinks and jumps into his grave. The entire cast marches towards the camera, their bodies elongating in time with the music. Finally, a baby drinks, and turns into Mr. Hyde. Despite the grue- someness of these images, the effect is pleasant because the characters' move- ments are so closely choreographed with the infectious jazz score (penned by Lou Fleischer). Other revue cartoons entered the realm of social satire. In betty boop for president (1932), the Fleischers parody Prohibition and campaign promises as Betty imitates a number of politicians, in- cluding Herbert Hoover. Betty boop's ups and downs (1932) is the Fleischers' Grapes of Wrath, where everyone on earth is dis- possessed. Neither cartoon has a plot; in- stead, they gently poke fun at the prob- lems of the country in a number of short, almost unrelated sight gags, and pleasant, but forgettable songs. Their charm lies in their, light-hearted approach to the subject matter, in contrast to the overpowering imagery of the psycho-sexual dramas. In 1932, the Fleischers arranged with King Features Syndicate to bring to the screen E.C. Segar's popular Thimble Theatre comic strip character, Popeye the Sailor. Popeye's debut was in a Betty Boop cartoon, popeye the sailor (1933), where he was first shown in a newspaper that announced that Popeye was now a movie star. Ko-Ko was merely a re-creation of Dave; Betty had appeared with her "Uncle Max" in a few cartoons. But Popeye was the first Fleischer character who was inde- pendent of his creator, and the only one who never returned to the inkwell. Popeye the sailor provided the basic plot of many Popeye cartoons. Popeye and Bluto are rivals for Olive Oyl's love. They compete for her favors, and Popeye even- tually wins by eating his spinach, and beat- ing Bluto in a fight. The early Popeye was a simple gruff character, but with the de- velopment of a story department in 1932, and with the later addition of actor-writer Jack Mercer (who provided Popeye's de- lightful ad libs), the characters attained a richness denied earlier Fleischer cartoon characters. In a dream walking (1934), we see de- velopment in both character and style. The film begins with a rear wiND0w-ish track along an apartment building wall, reveal- ing Popeye, Bluto, and Olive asleep in their separate apartments. Olive begins to sleepwalk, and exits through a window, upsetting a flowerpot. The crash awakens Popeye and Bluto, who rush out to save her. Olive walks along rooftops into a build- ing under construction. The two sailors struggle with each other for the privilege of rescuing her. Their fight goes on within a marvelously mechanistic geometric envi- ronment of moving beams and girders, 50 JAN. -FEB. 1975</page><page sequence="4">with the sailors using the beams and tools as weapons. After eating his spinach, Popeye wins the struggle, but Olive has walked right off the building, and is only saved from falling by the miraculous but seemingly inevitable presence of swinging beams that appear as she is about to step out into space. Popeye reaches Olive's window just as she reclines peacefully back into bed. The alarm clock goes off, Olive wakes, and thinks that Popeye is a peeping torn. As she hurls everything she can find at him, Popeye turns to the audience and says, "I saw my duty and done it, 'cause I'm Popeye the Sailor Man!" Popeye's invinci- bility is somewhat modified by his lack of success in love in a dream walking, and his endurance of the slings and arrows of outraged Olive reveals a stoic side of his nature. For better or worser (1935) combines grotesquerie and pessimism with the Fleischer cyclical plot. Popeye and Bluto live in a filthy tenement labelled "Bachelor Apts." After burning his dinner once more, Popeye says "It's no use, I have to get me a wife." He and Bluto visit a mat- rimonial agency, and both select a picture of Olive. As soon as Olive enters, in gown and veil, Bluto grabs her and tries to carry her off to a Justice of the Peace. Popeye follows, but in the struggle is covered with cement, and frozen into a statue (yet another metamorphosis). As Bluto drags Olive into Justice Wimpy's office Popeye manages to move under a pile driver, which breaks the cement and crushes him grotesquely into an accordian shape. Un- daunted, Popeye rushes into Wimpy's of- fice, takes his spinach, and defeats Bluto. But when Popeye sees his bride, looking none the better from her ord mal, he rushes back to his apartment, where he picks up an eggbeater and beats oeuf. By the mid-Thirties, the Fleischer studio was rivalled only by Walt Disney Produc- tions. Although Disney was more "artisti- cally" respectable at the time, Popeye had outstripped Mickey Mouse as the most popular cartoon character in the world. Both companies sought to refine their products in order to market more spectacu- lar cartoons, through longer color films. Many of the early Fleischer cartoons were tinted, including at least one sound "Song Car-Tune," has anybody seen kelly? (1926), but the practice was discon- tinued in 1929, because it was unprofita- ble. Disney's success with Technicolor changed that; and in 1934, the Fleischers produced their first "Color Classic", poor Cinderella. This was shot in a two-color process, because Disney's arrangement with Technicolor prevented other animators from using the process until 1935. Max compensated for this technical deficiency by devising the stereoptical pro- cess, which, he claimed, introduced a three-dimensional effect to animation. This process was a refinement of the first Ko- Ko cartoons. Previously, Max and Dave had presented their cartoon charac- ters in a real world. The stereoptical pro- cess adapted a real set to a cartoon world. A miniature set was constructed on a circu- lar table, and the eels were mounted in front of it. When the set was photographed through the eels, it appeared that the characters were moving in the set. By rotat- ing the table, the Fleischers could get the effect of tracking through a three- dimensional cartoon set. The effect was quite startling. In little dutch mill (1934), the Fleischers rotate a centrally pi- voted model of the inside of a windmill, as two cartoon children are chased by the villain. The three-dimensional effect given by the turning set gives a visual as well as an emotional, excitement to the scene. Aside from their use as technical exer- cises, the "Color Classics" were experi- ments with sentiment. All too often, though, they became exercises in the most maudlin sentimentality, outdoing Disney's excesses. In somewhere in dreamland (1936), two poor little children visit the sac- charine wonders of Dreamland in their sleep; when the children awaken, they find that local merchants have visited their hovel, and transformed it into a Dream- land on earth for the little tykes and their CONTINUED ON PAGE 53 M.

Patented Oct. 9, 1917. - 2 SHEETS- SHEET I, FILM COMMENT 51</page><page sequence="5">52 JAN. -FEB. 1975 SEX, DEATH, AND BETTY BOOP Images of sexuality and mortality, star- tling in their Freudian density, resound throughout the Fleischer cartoons. Generally, the sexual elements were stronger in the sound cartoons, while the Fleischers' horrifyingly morbid humor, worthy of the East European Starevich, was emphasized in their silent work. The silent harem scarum (1928), for example, begins with a live -action sequence show- ing a sultan as he paces the floor, ranting, "It's time that boob was here with the treasure." Enter the boob bearing a box, which he gives to his master. The sultan opens the box, revealing an inkwell, from which he produces Ko -Ko and Fitz. In one of the most gruesome moments in anima- tion, the sultan picks them up, pulls out a knife, and slices their heads off, the heads fall to the ground, blink once, and lie mo- tionless. The violence here is committed by a living character upon a cartoon character, thus violating a basic law of cartoon fan- tasy: that only a totally artificial environ- ment turns violence into humor. The Flei- schers' sound cartoons were not quite so grotesque as the silents in their use of sadism and catastrophe. When violence was later used, its impact was softened by ritualization and stylization, as in the "Popeye" series. Sexual elements in silent Fleischer car- toons were less obvious than those in the sound cartoons. In no eyes today (1929), Ko- Ko loses his eyes after he ogles a ba- thing beauty. This punishment for sexual- ity expresses a castration fear that is ex- pressed in the 1924 ko-ko needles the boss (where Ko-Ko' s weapon wilts in a duel with Max), and in harem scarum (where Ko-Ko and Fitz are chased through a harem by razor- wielding guards). In Betty co-ed, Bimbo tries to visit a temptress. His inability to see Betty by himself, and the way in which he is held by the mQtherly tree, reduce him to an impo- tent, childlike state. Bimbo's loss of masculinity is dealt with again in the Talkartoon bimbo's initia- tion (1931). Bimbo falls down a manhole, where is is invited to join the masculine, animal-like Order of Kucamunga Frater- nity. Bimbo's refusal is a refusal to recog- nize his sexual identity. The fraternity members torture Bimbo, but he escapes. Betty Boop calls "Come in, Big Boy," and Bimbo responds to this sexual invitation, following Betty down a long vaginal cor- ridor, as huge blades shash down, and traps clash, in an expression of his castra- tion fears. Bimbo finally emerges in a room filled with the fraternity members. One of them removes his pelt to reveal that he is Betty. Bimbo agrees to join, and is re- warded for this assumption of his sex role by the sight of all of the fraternity members stripping to reveal, in another metamor- phosis, that they are all Betty Boops. In the 1932 minnie the moocher, the Fleischers created a film replete with metamorphoses, sexual imagery, and fears of death and the unknown. Rowers, trees, a blot of lipstick all come to life, and Betty's nagging father is transformed into a phonograph. Within Betty's home, this mutability is harmless, but outside it can become a dangerous and frightening force. Betty is unhappy with her home life, but the sight of ghosts in the cave to which she flees with Bimbo persuades her to return home, just as Ko-Ko must return to the inkwell. In minnie the moocher, Betty and Bimbo elope, and flee to a deep cave (a place associated with sexuality in the Fleischer cartoons). Inside the cave, they are confronted with symbols of fertility and death: an androgynous walrus dances with phallic tusks and feminine grace; skeletons court each other and dance; nursing kittens consume their mothers. Betty and Bimbo are frightened not only by the ghosts, but by horrible images of their union. The visual richness of minnie the moocher is matched by snow white (1933). Pursuing Betty through a cave, Ko-Ko is transformed into a pole-shaped ghost, expressing both sexuality and death. The walls of the cave are painted with ghastly scenes of dancing and gambl- ing skeletons. As Ko-Ko progresses through the cave, his body elongates and contracts in time with his singing^of "St. James Infirmary Blues," and he turns into a twenty-dollar gold piece in illustration of the lyrics. Different elements of this scene work at varying levels. Ko- Ko' s phallic shape, and the death images on the walls of the vagi- nal cave, confirm the link with the visions of sex and death in minnie the moocher. But Ko-Ko's movements, his transforma- tion into a gold coin, and the singing of "St. James Infirmary Blues" do not fit the chase situation. The cave sequence be- comes a musical and visual interlude within the chase. The relationship between Popeye and Olive Oyl bears some resemblance to that which existed between Bimbo and Betty Boop. Whereas the early Betty Boop rep- resents a comically bohemian and attrac- tive sexuality, Olive is a thin spinsterly figure who dreams of sex with a pile of romance magazines by her bed. But dreaming is all she can do. Whenever she is confronted with the possibility of sex through an abduction by the powerful Bluto, she reflexively struggles to save her virtue. Popeye loves Olive, but is usually rendered harmless by Bluto, the elemental male. Spinach acts as a kind of wonder drug for Popeye's impotence, strengthen- ing the old one-eyed sailor so that he may win his love and beat a more vigorous rival. In many ways, the Fleischer's Super- man character resembles Popeye. Both are invincible, both series of cartoons often re- volved around a fight. Popeye and Superman are each involved with foolish women, and neither relationship is physi- cally consummated. Both characters must perform a ritual action before they gain their strength - Popeye must eat his spinach, and Superman must change into his uniform. The sexual conflict between Clark Kent and his alter ego Superman is similar to that between Popeye and Bluto in certain Popeye cartoons, such as ya GOTTA BE A FOOTBALL HERO (1935). Just as Olive falls in love with the powerful Bluto and rejects the mild Popeye, so Lois Lane rejects the mild Clark Kent in favor of the stronger Superman. Unlike Popeye, Clark Kent is never united with his love, and the sexual tensions are not resolved as they are in the Popeye cartoons. Aladdin and his wonderful lamp, a Popeye two -reeler of 1939, probably con- tains the last homosexual joke in Fleischer cartoons. The genie of the lamp is an ef- feminate character - the final echo of a series of jokes like the one in dizzy red riding hood (1931), when Betty skips mer- rily along to Granny's house, picking flowers, and singing "A flower for Granny, for Granny ..." A tree minces out, grabs her flowers, and sings "The fairies like them too!" By the end of the Thirties, the Betty Boop cartoons had undergone a considerable change. Betty had softened from a sexy actress to a responsible young woman. Her dress lengthened, she acquired a dog, grandfather, baby brother, and the duties of house cleaning and baby sitting. The character of Betty Boop was unable to sus- tain the change from the lower class sen- suality of the Depression to the middle class respectability of the films of the late Thirties. Animator Shamus Culhane, who worked for both Disney and the Fleischers, remarked that while Disney worked to perfect his art by refining character, the Fleischers perfected theirs through the elaboration of action and drawing. This would account for the kind of compact im- agery and rapid action of the Fleischers' snow white, where the musical, sexual, and morbid imagery is so dense that one experiences it almost subliminally. As sexual as the images appear, it was not the conscious intention of the Fleischer Studio to deal with sexual themes. Animator Myron Waldman recalls their surprise when a sequence of boilesk (1935) was censored in Philadelphia. In a lan- guage all my own (1935), Japanese stu- dents were consulted to determine if any of Betty Boop's gestures in an Oriental dance might be considered obscene in Japan. This conflict between the expres- sion and repression of sex by the Fleischer Studio might explain the link between sex and death in their films: death is the threatened punishment for sexual desire.</page><page sequence="6">MAX &amp; DAVE FLEISHER CONTINUED FROM PAGE 5 1 mother. The cartoon suffers further from impossibly sweet voices and a gooey choral accompaniment to the action. The Fleischers, with a few exceptions, seemed unable to deal with sentiment in an effec- tive manner, a fault that was to harm then- first sound feature. For two years, the "Color Classics" were the only Fleischer color cartoons. In 1936, the Fleischer Studio released a two -reel Special, POPEYE THE SAILOR MEETS SINDBAD the sailor, possibly the most spectacular cartoon made up to that time. The film opens on Bluto, as Sindbad, who takes the audience on a musical tour of his stereopti- cal island, where the very stones resemble skulls and beasts. Sindbad spies Popeye, Wimpy, and Olive as they sail past his island, and orders the Roc to "Wreck that ship, but bring me the woman." The Roc destroys the ship, and abducts Olive, as Popeye stoically observes, "Thaťs the big- gest buzzard I ever saw." Popeye and Wimpy swim to the island, where Popeye defeats the Roc, Boola the Two-headed Monster, and finally Sindbad. The film ends as all the beasts of the island join Popeye in the same song they sang with Sindbad at the film's beginning. Popeye the sailor meets sindbad the sailor is refreshingly free of the sentimen- talities of the "Color Classic" series. It uses the Fleischer cyclical plots but without the usual pessimism, grotesqueries, and mor- bid overtones of many of the earlier Popeye cartoons. The film also shows a concern for style and language that had been developed in earlier works. Many Betty Boop and Popeye cartoons depended on the use of verbal humor for comic effect. A similar outrageous use of language occurs in sindbad. A sign greets visitors to the island with the message: "Enter Not. Whosoever Passeth In, Pass- etti Out." Later, when Popeye combats Boola, the monster swears "By Carbonate! I make from you Chicken Fricassee Assisi!" The film also includes one of the Fleischers' visual puns. During the fight between Popeye and Sindbad, Popeye is squeezed in Sindbad' s grip. First, his face turns as red as a beet, and then actually turns into a beet - a new development from the usual metamorphosis . Most importantly, sindbad was the first true cartoon epic, impressive in length, color, and spectacle. The low- angle shots of the dark, massive Roc, and the accom- panying sound of rushing wind, give a sense of menace on a scale larger than any of the Fleischers' previous works. Al- though the environment of a dream walking had been as interesting in its mechanical expressionism as the set of sindbad was in its exotic expressionism, the gritty city streets of the Popeye series were forsaken for the exotic environments of MINNIE THE MOOCHER and SNOW WHITE. Popeye the sailor meets sindbad the sailor was instantly successful, and was often billed over its accompanying feature. It also won the studio its first Academy Award nomination for Short Subjects, but the award went to Disney for the country cousin (1936). Encouraged by success, the Fleischer Studio began work on two more Popeye specials. Before they were re- leased, an unsettling event occurred at the Fleischer Studio in New York. On April 20, 1937, the Commercial Art- ists and Designer's Union charged that Max Fleischer had refused to negotiate with the union after hearing the requests for pay increases and shorter hours. This was so. While Dave had worked fairly closely with the animators, Max preferred to work on management, development of techniques, and story ideas. He took a paternalistic attitude to his employees; to him the demands of the striking inkers, opaquers, and inbetweeners were like the demands of ungrateful children. Although salaried employees only received fifteen to twenty -seven dollars a week, this was on a par with wages at other animation studios. However, the work load was heavy, and since the Fleischers did not shoot pencil tests, there was not the margin for error that existed at Disney's or Iwerks' studios. Also, while Disney provided his staff with the latest of equipment, the Fleischers did not. As late as gulliver's travels (1939), the Fleischer Studio had only one Moviola, while Disney had many. The strike went on for many months and, although it was finally settled, the new situation did not please the Fleischers. In February of 1938, the Reischer Studios announced plans to construct a $300,000 studio in Miami, far from the labor prob- lems of New York. In the meantime, pro- duction continued in New York, and the Fleischers released perhaps the best of the two -reel Popeye cartoons. Popeye the sailor meets ali baba's forty thieves (1937), opens once more with a musical introduction by Bluto, this time as Abu Hassan, the scourge of the East, as he rides with his band through a stereoptical desert. Popeye, Wimpy, and Olive, stationed at a Coast Guard base, are ordered by radio to stop Hassan. Popeye's boat metamorphoses into an airplane, which crashes in the desert. As day turns into night, and back again, we see Popeye, Olive, and Wimpy trudge wearily through the desert, as Popeye whimsically mutters "I wish there was a boardwalk on this beach." When Olive col- lapses, Popeye pushes her into the shape of a camel, and they continue on until both Olive and Wimpy collapse. Popeye trans- forms them into a tank tread, and in this form they rush through the desert and into a town. While the travelers refresh them- selves in a cafe, Hassan and his men raid the town. When Popeye pulls Hassan off his horse, Hassan bellows "Think you're a tough guy, eh?" The embarrassed Popeye blushes and says "You can take me home for only $1.98." They fight, and Popeye is defeated. Hassan and his men leave town with Olive and Wimpy, Popeye pursues them, and cuts his way into Hassan's cave with the flame of his pipe. The sumptuous, three-dimensional in- terior of the cave has no equal in any of the Left: Betty and Bimbo sell "Jippo" to suckers in BETTY BOOP, M.D. Center and right: The Lilliputians lead Gulliver into the city, in GULLIVER'S TRAVELS. FILM COMMENT 53</page><page sequence="7">MAX &amp; DAVE FLEISHER CONTINUED Fleischers' work. Popeye proceeds ap- prehensively past brightly -colored heaps of jewels and gold, and finds that Olive and Wimpy have been enslaved by Has- san. Popeye pulls out his spinach, says "Open Sez-Me," and the can miracu- lously opens. His flexed bicep shows the form of a tank within - a typically mechanistic expression of strength. In a battle royal, he defeats Hassan and the forty theives, and returns in glory to the Arab town. Ali baba was a distinct improvement over the first two- reel Popeye. It replaces Sindbad's long, tedious musical introduc- tion, with a shorter introduction of Abu Hassan that is intercut with the introduc- tion of Popeye. Ali baba shows much more verbal and visual wit than its pred- ecessor. And it is enriched by a reference to some of the darker psychological themes of the earlier works. When Popeye first en- ters Abu Hassan's cave, he remarks: "I don't like it in here a bit!" This is rem- iniscent of the anxieties of Ko-Ko and Bimbo in the caves and hallways of KO-KO'S HAUNTED HOUSE, BIMBO'S INITIATION, and SNOW WHITE. The last of the Popeye specials was not the equal of the first two. Aladdin and his wonderful lamp (1939), a Hollywoodized version of the Aladdin story, is interesting for two reasons. First, it has a different type of self- consciousness from the silent Fleischer films. No animator appears in the Popeye cartoons, yet Popeye is aware that he is in a film. When he kisses Olive in Aladdin, Popeye hesitates shyly and says, "Gosh, I've never done this in Technicolor before." This kind of self- consciousness had occurred in popeye the sailor, when a newspaper proclaimed Popeye as a star. It was developed further in hold the wire (1936), when he temporarily forgets his part. Olive has to remind him that he is supposed to take his spinach. "I never thought of that," he replies. Popeye's self- consciousness finds greater expression in goonland (1938). A climactic battle between Popeye, his father, and the hostile Goons is so fierce that the film "breaks," and all of the Goons fall off the screen. Popeye comments, "That was a lucky break!", pulls the two halves of the broken film together, and the cartoon con- tinues. Unlike all the earlier Fleischer characters, Popeye does not need the in- tercession of an animator to control his fate. As the Betty Boop character became more domesticated in the late Thirties, her popularity declined, and when Mae Ques- tel refused to move with the studio to Miami in 1939, the series was dropped. The Popeye character continued to change as well, becoming increasingly gentle, often to the point of being foolish. In leave well enough alone (1939), Popeye frees all the animals in Olive's pet shop despite a wise parrot's advice to leave well enough alone. Popeye realizes that he is wrong when the dog catcher rounds up the hun- gry strays. In puttin' on the act (1940), Popeye and Olive polish up their routines after reading a newspaper article on the renaissance of vaudeville. Swee'pea dam- pens their enthusiasm when he points out that the paper is several decades old. Popeye's senile father, in with poopdeck pappy (1940), wants to spend his nights carousing, but Popeye worries about the old man's health. After many attempts to get Pappy to bed, Popeye finally chains him down. Popeye climbs into his own bed, turns out the light, and says "Good- night Pappy." No answer. Popeye turns on the light, and finds that he is chained to his bed, and the old man has escaped. This was a far cry from the gruff character of POPEYE THE SAILOR. Perhaps part of the reason that the Fleischer cartoons changed was the impact of "Disney fication." Many of the Fleischer staff of the Forties had worked for Disney or Iwerks in the Thirties, often moving from studio to studio. A strong Disney influence can be seen in the "Color Clas- sic" a KICK IN TIME (1940), animated by Shamus Culhane and Al Eugster after their return to the Fleischers from Iwerks and Disney. Spunky, a baby donkey, is sepa- rated from his mother Hunky - a stock Disney theme, but uncommon in the Reischer films. He is kidnaped and sold into slavery in a scene that bears an amaz- ing resemblance to the end of the Pleasure Island sequence in Disney's pinocchio. In a kick in time, the usual stereoptical pro- cess was discarded in favor of a less effec- tive approximation of the Disney Multip- lane camera effect. Also the characters were more naturalistic than the funky orig- inals developed by Myron Waldman. Many Fleischer characteristics remained, however, including a long passage de- voted to the process of harnessing Spunky, and occasional Reischeresque language, like "I'll be back in a flash with the trash."

Many Fleischer characteristics remained, however, including a long passage de- voted to the process of harnessing Spunky, and occasional Fleischeresque language, like "I'll be back in a flash with the trash." In 1938, the Fleischer Studio moved to Miami, where the staff was swollen by the addition of hundreds of artists hired to work on a sound feature, Gulliver's travels. Gulliver's travels did well at the box office, but the Fleischers were dissatisfied. Paramount, eager to duplicate the popular- ity of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, had forced the Fleischers to rush their film through production. Max and Dave felt that the film suffered, and indeed it had many problems. It lacked stylistic unity. Gulliver, Prince David, and Princess Glory were heavily rotoscoped, but the other characters were drawn in the free style of the Popeye cartoons. The contrast often made the rotoscoped characters look awkwardly lifelike, and the others crudely drawn. The script suffered from an apparent in- ability of the Fleischer Studio to make the hero or romantic leads interesting. The ob- server does not care whether the lovers are united, and one suspects that the Flei- schers did not care either. More attention was given to the subsidiary comic charac- ters, particularly King Little. Like the Popeye of the later cartoons, Little is reluc- tant to fight, but is on the winning side, and has Popeye's benevolent, slightly foolish quality. Bombo resembles Bluto in physique and temperament. In contrast, Princess Glory and Prince David are the antithesis of Betty and Bimbo or Popeye and Olive, replacing the former lower class comic- sexual relationships with a blandly "classy," sexless, over -romanticized one. Many of the backgrounds of Gulliver's travels recall - not always to their credit - the backgrounds of earlier Fleischer films. The interior of King Little's palace shows the same kind of detailed chiaroscuro as the backgrounds of minnie the moocher or snow white, but without the menacing imagery. Perhaps the best sequences in the film deal with mechanical processes. The binding of Gulliver begins with a bit of comic foreshadowing. As the tiny figures advance on the sleeping giant, they tie down a particularly noisy member of then- party. Then, by the light of the moon, they tie cables around Gulliver, construct cranes, and lift him onto a cart. Hundreds of cartoon horses are shown in heroic ang- les as they strain under the weight of Gulliver. Similar attention is given to the grooming of Gulliver with scythes and rakes. Unfortunately, more detail is given to these physical properties of Gulliver the giant, than to the personal qualities of Gul- liver the man. Some of the darker themes in the Flei- schers' earlier work are repeated in Gulliver's travels. Gulliver's pistol is taken from him when he is bound, in sym- bolic castration. He does not have the power to return home until the gun is re- turned to him. Furthermore, Prince David does not marry Princess Glory until he takes this pistol away from his father's agents. The Forties found the Fleischers without a replacement for the defunct Betty Boop series. The donkeys Hunky and Spunky, had a limited success, but a proto -Flintstones series of "Stone Age" cartoons proved very unpopular. In one form or another, every comic character of Gulliver's travels was tried out in a "Gabby Color Cartoon" or an "Animated Antics," but none was successful. Ex- penses were high at the studio, with a staff of hundreds, and this was aggravated when Paramount obtained the rights to animate Superman, the popular Action Comics character, in hopes of repeating Popeye's success, despite Dave Fleischer's protests that production costs would make any profit impossible. Superman (1941) revealed some stylistic difficulties that the Popeye cartoons did not have. Segar's style of drawing had more in common with the Fleischer style of the early Thirties than the drawings of Superman cartoonist Joe Shuster had in the early Forties. As a result, superman was an unhappy amalgam of different styles, combining Shuster's more naturalistic artwork for the heroes, with the Fleischers' more grotesque style for the villain. The "Superman Color Cartoons" were well received, but were too expensive to yield any significant profits. The Fleischers desperately needed to have a hit with their next feature, mr. bug goes to town (1941). The advance publicity for the film had an ominous ring to it. Not since the final days of Red Seal Pictures had the studio been so press-conscious. Weird publicity stunts were tried, such as an $185,000 insurance policy with Lloyds of London on the hands of the head animators. Even hangnails were to be covered. Mr. bug goes to town was billed as the first feature cartoon with an original story, although Dave Fleischer admits that he was influenced by Maeterlinck's Life of a Bee. The film opens with lyrical tracking shots through the sky, down past the buildings of a stereoptical New York, to a Left and right: Clark Kent and his alter-ego, Superman.

FILM COMMENT 55</page><page sequence="9">MAX &amp; DAVE FLEISHER CONTINUED park, where a man discards a lit match. The camera follows the match down to the world of the insects, finishing a poetic transition from the cosmic to the micro- cosmic. Mr. bug tells the story of a young grasshopper named Hoppity, his wooing of the lovely Honey Bee, and his search for a safe home for the entire insect commun- ity whose existence is threatened by the construction of a skyscraper. The insects' hopes become linked with the hopes of struggling songwriter Dick Dickens, who plans to rebuild his home where the sky- scraper is to be built, if his song is sold. The evil C. Bagley Beetle, however, has designs on Honey, and tries to thwart everyone's plans to achieve his own nefarious ends. Beetle's attempt to hide Dickens' check fails, and although the skyscraper is built, Hoppity, Honey, and the other insects find a home in Dickens' penthouse apartment garden. The connection between mr. bug and Frank Capra' s films go beyond the similar- ity of the titles. In physique, sincerity, and a faith in the future, Hoppity resembles Capra's arch -heroes, James Stewart and Gary Cooper. Mr. Beetle is the dark force that threatens the well being of the community, much like Edward Arnold in MEET JOHN DOE and MR. SMITH GOES TO Washington. Hoppity experiences the moment of disillusionment and despair that strikes Capra's heroes, but regains his faith and that of his fellow citizens at the end of the film. Nevertheless, the film does show a number of typical Fleischer features. The preoccupation with construction echoes Gulliver's travels, as the process of building the insect wedding chapel and the skyscraper show. Rotoscoping and conventionally animated figures are used more successfully than in the earlier fea- ture. Instead of producing a disunity of style, here the two styles illustrate a barrier between the rotoscoped human world and the insect world. This is similar to Disney's use of rotoscoping in dumbo, where the circus laborers are rotoscoped, but the animals are not, defining two different, but related worlds. This separation between animal and human was a fairly late de- velopment in the Reischers' work. In early Betty Boop and Popeye cartoons, the two mingled on an equal basis. The Jitterbug sequence where Hoppity gets electrified is an abstract interlude similar to dumbo's Pink Elephants On Parade sequence in its use of music and image. Perhaps the greatest weakness of both the Fleischer features is that they do not deal with the great fantasies and fears of childhood, as did the Disney films. Instead they concentrate on adult anxieties - fear of death, sexual fears, and fears of change - that could not effect children. Also, the studio suffered from a rift be- tween Max and Dave Fleischer. Since 1937, when they clashed in a per- sonal matter, the brothers had refused to talk to one another. Apparently, they were able to function in this manner. Dave di- rected the films, and Max handled techni- cal and administrative matters. Early in 1942, Dave resigned, although he retained his share of the company, and within the year he was producing "Color Phantasies" and "Color Rhapsodies" for Columbia, some of which were remakes of earlier Fleischer cartoons. In the meantime, the returns on mr. bug were not as good as had been hoped. Due to the war, the European and Japanese markets, which had made up a great part of the Reischer audience, were cut off. It also seems as if Paramount wanted the Fleischer Studio to founder: the Para- mount publicity office had actually sent advisors to Disney's studio to help prepare publicity for bambi. Max was now so deeply in debt that he was forced to sell the company to Paramount. In mid -1942, the studio was renamed the Famous Studio, with Fleischer employees Seymour Kneitel and Isadore Sparber as studio heads. The staff was pared drastically, and the studio re- turned to New York, where it was to pro- duce cartoons that continued to decline in quality. After losing the studio, Max developed a gunsight recording mechanism for the army. He worked for the Jam Handy Or- ganization, a Detroit concern that pro- duced advertising films and educational filmstrips, and then returned to the Bray Studio. In the Fifties, he was involved in a short-lived "Ko-Ko" cartoon series for television. Dave remained at Columbia for several years, and then joined Universal as a special effects man, where, he recalls, he painted cracks on someone's glasses for thoroughly modern millie. Max Fleischer died on November 12, 1972. Dave lives in semi- retirement in Hollywood, California. The brothers never did speak to each other again. MR. BUG GOES TO TOWN. Above left: the insect world.
