<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS A. J. Greimas and J. Courtes. Semiotics and Language: An Analytical Dictionary. Translated by Larry Crist and Daniel Patte and others. Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1982. 409 pp. Price: $35.00. Semiotics and Language is one of the most significant translations of A. J. Greimas' work to date. (In Februrary 1984 a translation of Structural Semantics, trans. Daniele McDowell, et al., Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1983, ap peared.) Previously there were only a handful of his articles available in English scattered in various journals. This book serves three important functions: 1) it is the most concise presentation of Greimas' own work in narrative semiotics; 2) it is an extremely useful overview of semiotics as a discipline; and 3) as semiotics is an outgrowth of structuralism, the book is also a valuable dictionary of structuralism. Published in 1979?as Semiotique, dictionnaire raisonn? de la th?orie du langage (Paris: Classiques Hachette)?Greimas and Courtes' dictionary was then state-of the-art semiotics. Their stated goal was "to review and evaluate the various theories of language and simultaneously to present a synthesis?or at least a partial one?of the various attempts that have been made to establish [language studies] as a coher ent discipline." They define language in the broad sense of "semiotic system(s) and/or process(es)," a definition that places them in opposition to Ducrot and Todorov, who use the more traditional sense of language as natural language in their Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Sciences of Language (trans. Catherine Porter, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1979), a work which Semiotics and Lan guage in some ways supersedes. Greimas and Courtes' dictionary contains over 650 brief articles on concepts con sidered germane to semiotics as a discipline. For example, there are articles on deep structure, synchrony, diachrony, achrony, synatagmatic, paradigmatic, culture, and ideology. This list gives us a sense of why the book serves very nicely as a dic tionary of structuralism. Each term is presented in its historical development, so that if one were to look up "phatic," for example, one would find not only how the term is used by Jakobson in his communication model, but also its prior use by Malinowksi. The range of theorists covered in the dictionary is impressive. In giving a sense of historicity of terms, the authors refer to L?vi-Strauss, Barthes, Hjemslev, Saussure, Benveniste, and Lotoman, to name just a few. The historical perspectives are not always as complete as one might wish, however. For example, the article</page><page sequence="2">196 COLLEGE LITERATURE "Intertextuality" cites Bakhtin as the originator of the concept, but overlooks Kristeva's significant work on the subject. For the reader interested in narrative theory, there is a wealth of information in Semiotics and Language. There are references not only to the structuralist Propp and the semiotican Bremond, but also to all the components of Greimas' own narra tive semiotics in readily accessible form. There are lengthy articles on actants, the narrative program, the modalities, and the semiotic square. Greimas' particular metalanguage for describing texts is sometimes recondite and self-consciously scien tific, so that as a guide to reading Greimas, the dictionary is indispensable. On the negative side, the book has three problems of increasing significance. First, there is its self-referentiality. In each article, every word that is defined in the dictionary is marked with an asterisk, and at the end of each article the reader is generally referred to several other articles. Since almost every noun is marked with an asterisk, one could, quite literally, read the whole book to follow out all the ref erences. The second problem has to do with the language. Although Greimas and Courtes intend their dictionary to be "an immediately accessible research tool" and at the same time "a more general introduction to language theory," the level of technical discourse renders the dictionary more suitable to the former rather than the latter purpose. A reader approaching the dictionary without some grounding in either structural linguistics or structural analysis would be daunted (and the diction ary's self-referentiality would probably only add to that reader's frustration). It is on this score, then, that the Ducrot and Todorov dictionary, which is less technical, has an advantage over Semiotics and Language as an introductory guide. The third and most crucial problem again has to do with language. The technicality of the language used to present the terms gives the definitions a kind of authority which perhaps even the proposer of the concept did not feel. There is a gap between the way the concepts are presented in the dictionary and the way the concepts were formed. The definitions and models are presented deductive ly, while the way in which these concepts were developed was unpredictable. The matter-of-factness of the definitions tends to mask an important ideological choice involved in using semiotics. The ideology informing semiotics is a rigorous, apolit ical, scientific neutrality (which the language very readily reveals) and anti-individ ualism, a quality semiotics shares with a number of post-struturalisms. This anti-in dividualism manifests itself in literary studies by Greimas' dismissal of character as "one of several terms used in literature and reserved for human beings [which] has been progressively replaced by two other concepts, more rigorously defined in semiotics: actant and actor." Character for Greimas is merely a discursive con struct, a meeting place of several smaller units, crucial to narrative, which we are blinded to by the apparant unity of anthropomorphic representation. Actantial analysis denies this unity, taking instead a decentered subject as its object of study. This is clearly a choice the interpreter must make. While I am sympathetic to efforts to get beyond such banal classifications as Forster's round and flat characters, the finality with which terms such as "character" are tossed off can give those unsym</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 197 pathetic to semiotics a chance to reject it out of hand. It would perhaps make more sense to view actantial analysis as a development in character study rather than its replacement. Ultimately, the largest implication semiotics has for literary studies is the shifting of the focus from aesthetics and poetics to ideology. In their article on poetics the authors write: "To state as initial postulate the literariness or the poetic ity of a particular class of discourses is to put the cart before the horse. There is a common stock of properties, articulations, and forms of organization of discourse which it is necessary to explore before attempting to recognize and determine the specificity of a particular type." This assertion can be a very uncomfortable for someone whose career has been based on aesthetic description. There were several changes made in the translation of the dictionary from French to English. The translators claim to have "consciously overtranslated." And they do well to provide notes when a French work has connotations that are absent in English. For example, the article "Historie" is translated as "Hi/story" with an ex planation that the French word encompasses the meanings of what in English are two distinct concepts?"story" and "history." However, their claim to have chosen "a considerably simpler style" by shortening sentences and changing diffi cult syntax, seems largely unsupported. In the entries I checked against the original French, the translations appeared quite literal. The English version of the dictionary has a necessary appendix of French head words and their English equivalents with those liberties taken by the translators duly noted. An important improvement in the English version of the dictionary is the inclusion of a selected bibliography of texts significant to the formation of semiotics. John N.
