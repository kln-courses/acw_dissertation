TUSHINGHAM Diringer, in his fundamental study,2" arranged all the impressions known to him at the time in three categories on a typological basis, i. e. Class I-flying scarab in a more or less naturalistic rendering; Class II-the same motif in a schematized form; Class III-all the winged sun-disk symbols.25 He listed, but did not make a clear choice between, the alternative suggestions as to the identity of the second symbol. His chronology, however, seemed to favour the "flying scroll " theory for he felt that the classes of stamps, as typologically ordered, coincided with three successive epigraphic periods-the break between Classes I and II falling about 700 B. C. and that between II and III in the reign of Josiah.26 The modifications to which Diringer's original proposals have been subjected are well summed up by Lapp. Lapp then proceeds to study the published stamp impres- sions with a view to discovering the number of different seals from which the stamps were made. He made the surprising discovery that three seals were responsible for Class I stamps, five seals for the Class II stamps and ten (possibly to be reduced to eight) for the Class III stamps. Furthermore, observed resemblances between the seals within each class led him to conclude that it is "difficult to think of more than one craftsman and perhaps an expert copyist" as responsible for the making of the seals of Class I and of the seals of Class II. "Further, it is highly unlikely that the same artisan made the class 1 and class 2 seals." 2" After weighing the archaeological, historical and palaeographic evidence, he concluded that the first two provide little specific data on which to date the impressions of the various classes; the third, however, " suggests that the two-winged impressions belong to the late seventh and early sixth centuries B. C., and that the four-winged impressions are earlier. Whether the four-winged impressions date from the reign of Manasseh or go back as far as Hezekiah's reign cannot be determined on palaeographic grounds." 28 Aharoni, discussing the question anew on the basis of his studies of royal stamped jar handles at Ramat Rah.el, took up Lapp's suggestion about the number of original seals responsible for the many impressions and fitted the Ramat Rahel material into Lapp's framework. The resulting statistical tables 29 indicated that only one additional Class I seal and three Class III seals need be added to Lapp's list to account for all the impressions. In his report on the 1959-60 seasons, Aharoni noted that only one seal each for Ziph, Socoh and M-m-s-t was required to account for all the impressions in Classes I and II.30 Aharoni then argued that, if we accept a date for the Class III stamps "in the period of Josiah, it would be unbelievable that from Hezekiah during the long reign of Manasseh one and the same seal was in use" (i.e. of the Class I and II types which are assumed to precede the Class II type). Aharoni, further, is inclined to deny the validity of the palaeographic argument as presented by Lapp and, by so doing, appears to destroy any possibility of ordering the various classes of stamps on epigraphic grounds. More positively, Aharoni claimed that the archaeological evidence from Ramat Rahel supported an earlier dating for the stamps, i. e. to the reigns of Hezekiah 24 David Diringer, "The Royal Jar-Handle Stamps of Ancient Judah," Biblical Archaeologist, 12 (1949), pp. 70 ff. 25 Lapp, op. cit., points out that it is possible to subdivide Diringer's Class III into two on the basis of greater or less stylization. 26 Diringer, " Royal Jar-Handle Stamps . . . ," pp. 76 ff., 84 ff. 27 Lapp, op. cit., pp. 14 ff. 28 Op. cit., p. 21. 29 RR 1959-60, pp. 46 ff., slightly modified in RR 1961-62, p. 33 f., 61 ff. 30 RR 1959-60, p. 52. 23</page><page sequence="2">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research and Manasseh, for " specimens of all classes of royal stamps (were discovered) beneath the floors of the Iron Age citadel." "' That the citadel of Ramat Rahlel came to an end in the early part of the sixth century seems probable judging from the pottery lying on top of its latest floors.32 This citadel rested on an artificial platform created by heaping fill behind a great retaining wall.33 "The composition of the filling enabled us to come to the important chronological conclusion that the outer defence-wall was built in the last phase of the Iron Age, exactly as had been found to be the case with regard to the inner citadel. Both of these structures were thus part of a single building programme executed by one of the last kings of Judah." a' Aharoni suggests that the king may have been Jehoiakim on the basis of the words of Jeremiah 22:13-19 35 but a slightly earlier date, in the reign of Josiah, is possible.36 The artificial fill of this citadel engulfed an earlier building which Aharoni ascribed to Stratum VB and dated to the 8th-7th century B. C. The majority of the royal stamped jar handles at Ramat Rahel apparently came from the artificial fill enclosed and retained by the wall of the Outer Citadel,37 but others were definitely found on the floors of the citadel.38 As Aharoni points out that the pottery from the artificial fill (Stratum VB) is essentially the same as that from the floors of the citadel (Stratum VA) 39 and the extraneous pieces are probably to be assigned to the earlier building, it appears unwarranted to assign all the stamped jar handles, whether found in the fill or on the floors of Stratum VA, to the earlier period. This is, of course, theoretically possible but there is no stratigraphic evidence to indicate that they are earlier than the fill which contains them and this, as Aharoni admits, belongs to the period of the construction of the citadel-i. e. the end of the seventh century. To the extent, then, that Ramat Ralhel adds some archaeological evidence to that summed up by Lapp, it is to the effect that the stamped jar handles were in use before the construction of the latest pre-exilic structures at Ramat Rahlel; as the pottery of the fill which contains them is almost indistinguishable from that which rests on the floors and dates from the final use of the citadel before its destruction, probably in 586 B. C.,40 neither the pottery of the fill nor the stamped jar handles can be dated much earlier than Aharoni dates the construction of the citadel-i. e. in the reign of Jehoiakim or possibly Josiah. Finally, the palaeographical evidence appears now to lead to the same conclusion: not only is there no basis for spreading the seal types over a period of over a century on the basis of their script, there is strong support for assigning a Josianic date to all of them.41 Lance 42 adds significantly to the evidence concerning the dating of the stamps in his observation that, while in general the stamped jar handles are confined to the Kingdom of Judah, they have been found also at Gezer and Jericho. Both of these cities were part of the Northern Kingdom of Israel and, after its fall, were incorporated into the Assyrian Empire. The best explanation for the presence of the royal stamps at these sites is the assumption that they were " liberated " by O10p. cit., p. 51. 32Ibid., pp. 40 f. figs. 25, 26; cf. also RR 1961-62, pp. 29 ff. and figs. 16-21.

That they should be found at these sites and not, so far at least, at other northern cities such as Bethel and Megiddo should pose no problem. Apart from the fact that the evidence is negative, i.e. no jar handles have been found (or recognized) at such sites, it is probably too much to expect that in the very short time at his disposal, Josiah was able to organize the former Northern Kingdom and fit its administration into the pattern established for the Southern. Gezer and Jericho, lying on the very borders of Judah and astride roads leading up to Jerusalem from west and east, would demand early attention and they obviously received it. Whatever the reason or reasons for the present lack of evidence for the stamped handles in other Northern sites, there appears to be a convergence of evidence for the dating of the stamps to the reign of Josiah, viz.: a) The archaeological evidence is not decisive but certainly can be interpreted (particularly that from Ramat Ralhel) as favouring the assignment of all jar impressions to the last forty years of the Southern Kingdom, beginning no earlier than the reign of Josiah. b) The palaeographic evidence accords best with the view that all the royal jar impressions, whichever device they bear, four-winged scarab or winged solar disk, come from the same period and that the period is the reign of Josiah. c) The small number of actual stamps responsible for the impressions favours a short span of use for them, such as is supported by (a) and (b). d) Finally, historical probability (the best explanation of the occur- rence of the seal impressions at Gezer and Jericho) favours the reign of Josiah. If we are correct in our argument that the royal device of the Northern Kingdom was the four-winged flying scarab with sun-balls clasped between its front and hind legs, its presence on the royal stamps of the Southern Kingdom from the time of Josiah lends strong support to that historical reconstruction of the last half-century of the Southern Mon- archy which sees in Josiah's actions-both political and religious-the logical outcome of a positive policy of restoring the Davidic state. While Hezekiah, earlier, may have conceived of himself as the heir of the imperium exercised, before the fall of Samaria, by the kings of the Northern Monarchy, which was an illegitimate secession from the Davidic line in the eyes of Judaean political and religious leaders, the incorpora- tion of the northern territory into the Assyrian Empire made any overt attempt to seize it impractical. But the weakness of the Empire after the death of Assurbanipal, and its rapid decline under the pressure of enemies on all sides, provided what must have seemed a God-given opportunity, and Josiah seized it.43 His use of the royal insignia of the 43See M.

If this is the meaning to be assigned to Josiah's use of the four-winged flying scarab motif, we may have a clue to the interpretation and signifi- cance of the other device used on the royal stamped jar-handles-i. e. the winged solar disk. It will be well, therefore, to look once more at this and seek a closer identification of the motif, an explanation for the exceeding crudeness of the representation of both motifs (four-winged scarab and winged solar disk) and a consideration of the circumstances under which two symbols would be used on royal seals of the Kingdom of Judah. The identification of the second motif as a winged solar disk still leaves certain details unsatisfactorily accounted for. Lapp notes that "there do not appear to be close affinities to the upturned wings and bird's head." " We must, therefore, attempt a historical treatment of the motif, if only to attempt to seek the probable source (or different explanations) for these apparent anomalies.45 There seems to be no doubt that the winged solar disk had its origin in Egypt, where it was a symbol of the god Horus of Edfu."4 As the Pharaoh was the incarna- tion of Horus, and the symbol was always closely associated with him, it would naturally have a particular attraction, because of Egypt's prestige, for the monarchs of foreign lands. " The earliest ascertainable example""7 of its use in western Asia is probably the seal impression on tablet no. AT/39/73 from the Level VII temple at Alalakh,48 i.e. from the first half of the 17th century B. C. It recurs on other seals and seal impressions of Level IV from the same site,49 i. e. from no later than the early part of the 14th century, and down to the very end of Alalakh's existence, 50 about 1200 B.

The main lines of development, however, should become clear. 46 The earliest depiction is apparently that on a comb of the First Dynasty, illustrated in J. Vandier, Manuel d'Archdologie Egyptienne (Paris, 1952-55), I, p. 849, fig. 566 where a solar boat bears the Horus hawk and in turn is supported on out-stretched wings. The earliest winged sun disk was found in the tomb of King Sahu-re, cf. L. Borchardt, Das Grabdenkmal des Konigs Sahu-re (Leipzig, 1910), pl. 9. I am indebted to my colleague, Dr. Nicholas Millet for these references. Other examples occur in the Twelfth Dynasty (cf. the stela of Sesostris III illustrated in JNES 12 [1953], pl. LXV [with pendant uraei], and on scarabs, cf. H. R. Hall, op. cit., nos. 114 and 233) at which period, no doubt, it was first introduced into western Asia. But, like the two-winged scarab, it found its greatest popularity in the New Kingdom, especially from the reign of Tuthmosis III, cf. Hall, op. cit., nos. 405, 410, 523, 524, 790, 792-804, etc. Its later use is demonstrated by its appearance on a scarab of the Pharaoh Taharqa of Dynasty XXV found at Nimrud and illustrated in Mallowan, op. cit., vol. II, p. 599, fig. 583. 4 R. D. Barnett, Nimrud Ivories, p. 38. 41Ibid., p. 36, fig. 2, and Sir Leonard Woolley, Alalakh, An Account of the Excavations at Tell Atchana (Report no.

Stylistically 26</page><page sequence="5">Number 201 February, 1971 The winged solar disk appears in Hittite art of the Empire period 61 and continues in use in the Syro-Hittite kingdoms which succeeded it after 1200 B. C.52 For the Empire period at least the motif appears to serve preeminently as a designation of royalty, whether the personage represented is a king, a queen or a god. The device has also certain peculiarities of form which are distinctive. In most, if not all, cases under the Empire, the symbol has the strange form which characterizes our Josianic device-each wing has a double curve, more or less pronounced, and the tips of the wings turn up sharply. This feature is preserved in some cases in the post-1200 successor states (cf. for instance, the Malatya example referred to in footnote 52) but, in general, the representations of the sun-disk symbol of this period have wings with a more or less horizontal upper line--no doubt a result of direct Assyrian (or Syrian) influence which is so evident in these sculptures in other respects. The peculiarity is not derived from Mitannian influences, as far as we can see,53 nor from Mesopotamian sources generally."5 In the Hittite form of the winged sun-disk there are also other peculiarities. For instance, the sun-disk appears to be supported on the wings, instead of being treated as the body from which the wings spring; in fact, the upper edges of the wings, towards the centre, are curved down and around to fit the disk's lower edge. Below the disk, and forming as it were an appendage, is a slight projection the exact form of which does not appear to have any chronological significance. Its shape may suggest only that it represents the joints of the wings at their point of joining the body,55 or these may be accentuated and drawn down to form volutes." Some- times there is no appendage at all.57 Most usual, however, is a slight projection similar to no. 124, and dated to the same period is seal 991 published by Briggs Buchanan in Catalogue of Ancient Near Eastern Seals in the Ashmolean Museum, Vol. I: Cylinder Seals (Oxford, 1966) ; cf. also, nos. 888, 889, and the " Hyksos" cylinder no. 905. 51On seals, cf.

The depiction on the Malatya orthostat (cf. Akurgal, op. cit., pl. 104 top) may be a late survival of this; the volutes in the Karatepe orthostat, ibid., pl. 149, are vestigial. Such volutes may have evolved from the pendant uraei common in Egyptian depictions (see above, n. 46). For possible further development, see below, n. 84. 57 Cf. the bronze illustrated in Akurgal, op. cit., pl. 47 upper, in the figurines, ibid., pl. 53, upper row, and in the Megiddo ivory referred to in n. 51. 27</page><page sequence="6">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research downward, the curving sides of which converge towards the bottom or are parallel but do not flare; r if the curving sides, in fact, are drawn as volutes, there is an obvious flare.59 In such cases, when the seal impression is without details,6O the combination of wedge-shaped appendage and wings with upturned tips is strongly reminiscent of the Judaean royal stamps. Finally, there is apparently a combination of volutes and "tail," 61 but in these cases we must probably look for the origin of the " tail" not to the downward projection of the Hittite motif, which we have just been discussing, but to a Syrian source. All of these versions of the appendage below the sun-disk, except the last, follow established Hittite traditions; it is, however, not possible to establish any chronological priority among them for all appear to be in use during the late imperial period. There is one other feature of the Hittite sun-disk motif that should be noted: sometimes there is a second disk 62 which stands above the first and is apparently a duplicate of it, insofar as size and ornament (" spokes") are concerned. This second disk does not occur in all seals of the imperial period and does not appear at all in the Syro-Hittite or later representations; in other words, the Hittite sun- disk motif appears to be complete without the second disk and normally has no features above the wing line. If, in fact, there is some connection between the Hittite form of the winged solar disk used as a symbol of royalty and the impression of the royal Judaean stamps, it should be possible to trace its passage both chronologically and geographically through Syria. Unfortunately, the evidence is, to say the least, ambiguous, probably for a very good reason. It was in Syria and Palestine that Egyptian influence was most strongly and directly felt; it is not surprising, therefore, that in the use of symbols, especially those which had an ultimately Egyptian source, the forms these would take would be close to the Egyptian models.63 In spite, however, of the s Cf. the seals drawn in Akurgal, op. cit., p. 61, fig. 1, upper left and centre, lower right; see also the seal of Suppiluliuma illustrated ibid., pl. 45; for many more examples, cf.

In the Tell Halaf orthostat of ANEP, no. 653, there are also vertical " feathers" but the "tail" rests on a "pedestal " decorated with four rosettes. The Til-Barsib stela (ibid., 532) has also seven vertical striations (feathers) and volutes while the Zinjirli stela of Akurgal, op. cit., pl. 130 has only two vertical lines with volutes on either side. It is probably best to consider all of these as accomodations of Hittite elements to a predominantly Syrian version of the sun-disk motif; cf. the Yehawmilk stela from Byblos, illustrated in ANEP, no. 477, where the sun-disk has a tail made up of vertical elements but no volutes, and n. 84 below. 62 Gilterbock, op. cit., part 1, p. 63.13B C and p. 64.36 (both Urbi-Tesup) ; p. 67.52, 53, 56 (Tudhaliya). 63 E. g. the rock carving of Ramses II at Nahr al-Kalb, north of Beirut; cf.

While a presumed Hittite inspiration could best explain the double curve of the wings and the upswept wing-tips of the symbol on the Judaean royal stamps, there are other features in the latter which perhaps demand another source-or at least influence from another direction. In spite of the crudeness of all the stamps of this type, it is obvious that the wings are attached to the middle of what might be called a "body." In the middle, on the horizontal line of the wings, there sometimes appears the vague outline of a disk.66 Above and below it extend appendages with squared-off ends and straight, but slightly flaring, sides; both, in fact, look like very stylized tails and the vertical lines which appear on one or both of these "6 suggest very strongly the treatment of the tail in those earlier examples already noted.68 It is difficult, however, to see here the representation of a bird. McCown's statement, quoted by Lapp, and the latter's even stronger assertion overstate the case."6 Even conceding, as we do, that the motif is a form of the winged solar disk, it must be denied that the upper part of the "body " bears any convincing resem- blance to a bird's head or beak. Furthermore, nowhere is the winged solar disk depicted with a bird's head. If we focus our attention only on the body, we might assume that the two very similar tail-like appendages above and below are in fact stylizations of an Assyrian form of the sun-disk. As, chronologically, such a derivation has some plausibility, it is necessary to glance briefly at the several types into which the Assyrian depictions of the sun-disk fall. a) A central disk with wings outstretched and feathered in such a way that the feathers form a perfect curving are below and there is no distinct tail.

More or less representational depictions of the god and the winged sun-disk appear on seals which have a generally Syro-Phoenician background; 7" stylized forms also appear.75 There is, however, no clear evidence that any of these belonged to an official of either of the Hebrew kingdoms. We cannot, therefore, assume that the "torso" of the winged solar disk, as it appears on the stamped Judaean jar-handles has an Assyrian source for, apart from the uncertainty as to its prototype (because of its crudeness) there is no evidence that the Assyrian form of the symbol was ever used in Israel or Judah. Two other factors make an Assyrian derivation even more unlikely: the outline of the wing and the upturned tip-a detail which appears never to occur in the Assyrian form of the winged sun- disk; and the consideration that if these royal stamp impressions belong, as seems probable, to the reign of Josiah, we would not expect to find a symbol which implied Assyrian suzerainty. The solution to the problem of the identification of the device which lies behind the two-winged solar disk of the Judaean royal stamps may now be at hand as a result of the complete publication of the ivories from Nimrud by Professor Mallowan, and the studies of two scholars, Dr. R. C. Barnett 76 and Miss Ruth Amiran.77 Barnett discusses the identity of the figure which appears in the outer zone of the silver Palestrina bowl and seems to represent the " winged Hathor-headed sun-goddess " with curled tresses holding protectively between her hands the hero riding in his horse-drawn chariot. In an earlier episode of this " comic-strip" epic or myth, the hero appears to be making an offering to the same goddess-but in this case she appears as a simple winged sun-disk without identifying (and specifically anthropomorphic) characteristics.

This identification seems to be proven by the depiction of this sun-goddess on three plaques from Nimrud.79 On these a central disk (or, perhaps, sun- circlet-see below) is borne aloft on wings which stretch to either side; above is the head of the goddess with her characteristic downswept and upcurling tresses; her arms are outstretched above the wings and each of her hands holds vertically a lotus flower or lily; below the disk (which seems to be treated as the goddess' body) is a flaring, feathered tail. Mallowan identifies the " disk " as a sun-circlet betokening " authority derived from the sun," o80 basing this identification on another ivory plaque.8" These ivories and the motifs they bear are of Syrian provenance and represent Syro-Palestinian, not Assyrian, theological and mythical ideas. It is therefore legitimate to attempt to elucidate a Palestinian symbol (in this case the prototype of the sun-disk device on the Judaean jar- handles) by reference to motifs and ideas represented in the ivories. If there were any doubt, Miss Amiran's article 77 should dispel it. With the depictions of the sun-goddess on the Nimrud ivories just referred to she has compared the iconography of the clay female figurines, often with down-swept and curling locks, and clasping a " disk " to their breast, which have been found in many Palestinian excavations. That they are representations of the sun-goddess there can be no doubt. That some of them, at least, come from the period of the United Monarchy s2 makes them directly germane to our study. We may, therefore, legitimately turn back to those ivories from Nimrud and other Assyrian cities which, on other grounds, betray their Syrian backgrounds, observe the different forms of the winged sun-disk represented on them, and be confident that all have been known at some time in Canaan. Among them we may find the prototype of the sun- disk symbol used on the royal stamps of Judah. It is possible to derive our crude device by a process of theological bowdlerization and schema- tization from the anthropomorphic representation on the ivories discussed above.79 The head and tail will become the wedge-shaped appendages projecting above and below the disk in the royal stamp; the curving upper line of the wings in the ivories is exaggerated in the royal stamp but is present in both. (If a sharper upturn for the wing-tips is required, we may even assume that the lapidary who produced the Judaean stamp 78 Cf. James B. Pritchard (ed.), The Ancient Near East, Supplementary Texts and Pictures Relating to the Old Testament (Princeton, 1969), no. 829.

But, while the possibility of such derivation exists, it is unnecessary to assume that such a crass anthropomorphic (and pagan) symbol would have had an official status, even royal approval, in the period of the Hebrew monarchy. The greatest objection to this particular prototype, however, is that it is the representation of a goddess; while Yahweh may have been endowed with certain sun-god qualities and character- istics, and the official cult may have-in its architectural setting, para- phernalia, and ritual-been coloured by sun-god theology,s3 there is nowhere any suggestion that a goddess played a role in the national religion. Other winged sun-disk motifs appear at Nimrud, all with the volutes which may represent some connection with the sun-goddess.8" But, since in many instances, the same form of the symbol is associated with male and female figures s5 (whether these are to be interpreted as gods and goddesses-which appears unlikely-or as heroes and heroines), it is probably preferable to treat the symbol itself as neutral-i. e. its refer- ence is to the sun, whether the sun-deity is considered to be male or female. One series of ivory plaques in particular,86 in which the winged sun- disk motif seems to have this ambivalence, may provide a prototype of our Judaean device. In this version, the wings spread outward and upward at a rather sharp angle from the central disk; above and below the disk, and filling the space between the wings on either side, are flaring bunches of feathers. The same form of the sun-disk, although somewhat less luxuriant, also occurs on the so-called tomb stela from Zinjirli.87 The date of both ivory plaques and stela is probably the 8th 83E.g., the horses and chariots of the sun, II Kings 23:11; the ritual referred to in Ezek. 8:16; the east-west orientation of the Temple itself may reflect similar beliefs. 84 Mallowan, op. cit., vol. II, figs. 381, 382, 385, 387, 390, 391, 395-97, 401, 402, 406, 419. See also Barnett Nimrud Ivories, pl. CXXV. no. V 12 (probably from Toprak Kale). It is possible, of course, that the identification of the volutes with the tresses of the sun-goddess is a secondary development. If so, the volutes do not necessarily imply that the sun-divinity referred to by the symbol is female. Such volutes may well be an evolution from the pendant uraei, frequently found on the native Egyptian depictions of the winged sun-disk (see above, f. n. 46), even though the uraei continued in their original form in the triangular ivory plaques from Nimrud already referred to (above, n. 63). If there is such a development its stages may be represented by the volutes found in Hittite variations of the sun-disk motif (see above, f. n. 56) and the Syro-Hittite monuments from Zinjirli, Til-Barsib and Tell Halaf (cf. ANEP, 531, 532, 630, 653) ; see also Phoenician seals and sealings such as those published by W. Culican, "The Iconography of Some Phoenician Seals and Seal Impressions," Australian Journal of Biblical Archaeology, I (1968), pp. 50 ff., especially pls. II. A, C and 11.2 (all from Beirut). Possibly related, also, are the "streamers " which appear in late Assyrian seals such as those illustrated in Edith Porada, Corpus of Ancient Near Eastern Seals in North American Collections (Washington, 1948), vol. I (Plates), nos. 640-47, 650, 700, 707, etc. 85 Cf. Mallowan, op. cit., vol. II, figs. 385, 395-97. 86 Ibid., figs. 395-97. s7 Akurgal, op. cit., pl. 130.

It is this form of the sun-disk, we submit, which is the prototype of the crude representations found on the royal Judaean jar stamps. All the features of the latter can be found in the former: the central disk, the somewhat wedge- or tail-shaped appendages above and below the disk, the vertical fluting on these appendages (representing the feathering), the upswept wings. This last feature, to be sure, is not evident on the Zinjirli stela, nor do the Nimrud ivories have such sharply upturned tips. We have already, however,ss found reason to believe that such a treatment of the wings was already known in Syria as a result of Hittite influence. Further it is possible that a seal published by Diringer89 may be considered as bearing a simplified form of the prototype. If it is accepted that the two-winged symbol on the royal stamps of the kingdom of Judah is a form (developed in Syria) of the old winged sun-disk which had, from its origins in Egypt, been a device intimately associated with kingship, we may proceed to ask those other questions raised above: why should it be used together with another symbol, which we have already suggested was the royal device of the Northern King- dom; why should both be so crudely depicted; and why, if they are royal symbols, is it necessary to write 1-m-1-k " belonging to the king " over both of them? The circumstances under which the royal stamps on jar-handles came to be used in the Kingdom of Judah should provide the answers to these questions. Josiah's attempt to reconstitute the Kingdom of David would lead him to claim and assume all those royal prerogatives which had earlier characterized the separate states of Israel and Judah. His use of the royal seals of the former kingdoms would be not only a declaration of independence against the former suzerain, Assyria, but would assert his title to be the legitimate ruler of all the territories which had been embraced by the United Monarchy. If, as we have seen good reason to believe, the four-winged scarab was the royal device of Israel, the winged sun-disk can best be interpreted as the royal symbol of Judah and, by inference, the royal symbol of the United Monarchy of David and Solomon. The debacle of 722 B. C., which brought the Northern Kingdom to an end, presumably led to the destruction or loss of Israelite royal seals. Assyrian domination of Judah for three quarters of a century, from Sennacherib's campaign against Hezekiah in 701 B. C. to the death of Assurbanipal and Josiah's annexation of the territories of the former and 212 (fig. 8). Yadin interprets the sun-disk in the Zinjirli monuments to be the symbol of El, coupled with the yoke sign as a symbol of Rakkab-E1). That the winged sun-disk is a symbol of El is evident from the stela dedicated to that god found at Ras Shamra (see ANEP, no. 493). That the particular form of the sun- disk which, on other grounds, we believe to be the prototype of the Judaean symbol is, at Zinjirli, the symbol of El, is a strong argument in favour of our view that, in the ivories, it is not restricted to a sun-goddess. Furthermore, its use in Judah as a symbol of Yahweh, Israel's supreme god, and hence as the royal symbol par excellence of the Davidic house is thereby made most probable. (Dr. Yadin's important article came into my hands only after this paper was finished). 88 Above, n. 64. s Diringer, op. cit., p. 260, no. 103, pl. XXII.16. 33</page><page sequence="12">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research Northern Kingdom in 627 B. C.,90 had no doubt limited the royal power and prerogatives at the same time as it modified the national cult in Jerusalem.91 An Assyrian overlord would restrict, if not forbid, the use of a royal seal by a vassal-king for it was a tangible and conspicuous claim to independence. It is quite probable, therefore, that the royal seal of Judah went out of use (if it was not destroyed) -at least during the reigns of Manasseh and Amon-as one concession to the Assyrian master. The reasoning which leads us to believe that the royal seals of Israel and Judah would have been destroyed, lost or proscribed as a result of conquest or domination by a foreign overlord forces us to the conclu- sion that Josiah, when he began actively to lay claim to the whole patrimony of David, would require new seals of the two Kingdoms. It is probable that his decision to act was precipitated by the death of Assurbanipal. From the city of Jerusalem, the international political situation must have appeared chaotic; the once great empire of Assyria was falling to ruins as rival contestants fought for the throne. Its immi- nent collapse was an invitation to other powers to fill the power vacuum and take over world domination. If Josiah was to carve out of the former empire a new kingdom for himself, he must act fast not only to make his title known but to defend it. There seems little doubt, therefore, that the crudeness of the seals produced for him is to be explained by haste.92 This haste also appears to offer an explanation for the addition to the seals of the word 1-m-1-k, " royal," "belonging to the king." We have already seen that the seal of the Kingdom of Israel bore only a device without an inscription; its efficacy depended on immediate recognition of its significance by all who saw it. But in Judah, when Josiah required such recognizable tokens of his new claims to sovereignty over the Northern Kingdom, there would be little or no memory of the northern symbol and, obviously, no automatic acceptance of it. The situation was further complicated by the presence, in the northern territories, of exiles from other parts of the Empire who could have no knowledge of the earlier royal seal of the Kingdom of Israel. But, if the Northern symbol had been out of use for a century, that of Judah had probably been under the ban for three quarters of a century. The result would be the same: few, if any, would remember it. Moreover, the crude representation of both symbols would lead to doubt as to their signifi- cance. The obvious solution was to add the superscription "royal " in each case. We may sum up our argument by restating the main points: 1) The royal device of the Northern Kingdom was the four-winged flying scarab beetle with sun-balls clasped in its fore- and hind-legs. The seal which gave rise to this article, therefore, may be the one surviving royal seal of Israel. 90 William W. Hallo, "From Qarqar to Carchemish. Assyria and Israel in the Light of New Discoveries," BA 23 (1960), p. 61. 9111 Kings 18.13 ff.; 21. 92 Certainly the lapidaries of the day were able to do far better work than is represented on these seals; cf. for instance, the private seals cut for officials referred to in notes 15-18 above. 34</page><page sequence="13">Number 201 February, 1971 2) Its use in the royal stamp-impressions of the Southern Kingdom, probably during the reign of Josiah, is to be explained as a result of that king's claim to be the legitimate heir to the Northern Kingdom. 3) The fact that another device-identified as a winged sun-disk- also appears on the royal stamp-impressions of Judah while in every other respect the two types of stamp are identical (in motif and inscription, not in workmanship) suggests that the device is the royal symbol of the Southern Kingdom. 4) While the rendering of the winged sun-disk motif on the stamp- impressions is very crude, its prototype is probably to be sought in a version of the winged sun-disk motif which was demonstrably current in Syria during the period of the Monarchy. 5) The use of the two devices on the royal stamp-impressions is a clear demonstration of Josiah's overt claim to be the successor to the Israelite Kingdom as it existed under David and Solomon. 6) The crudeness of the renderings of both devices and the addition of the word 1-m-1-k to both is interpreted as a result of haste, of the lack of former seals to use as models, and the necessity of making the signifi- cance of the two admittedly crude and probably forgotten symbols known to all citizens of the newly reconstituted and independent kingdom. Admittedly, the evidence for all parts of the argument is not of equal weight, but it does provide an explanation for the two symbols on the royal stamp-impressions, their historical setting, and their crude render- ing. Possibly, a royal seal of the House of Judah may some day be found to prove or disprove the above thesis.</page></plain_text>
