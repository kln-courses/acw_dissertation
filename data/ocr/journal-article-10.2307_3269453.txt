<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD*) BY R. PETTAZZONI The subject of the attributes of Deity was until recent times reserved for the speculations of theology and philosophy. Omni- science is attributed to God as early as Xenophanes (sixth century B.C.), in terms which are re-echoed in the Sibylline oracles and in Clement of Alexandria, and so down to Newton. Epicurus, who denied Providence, denied Divine omniscience at the same time. The doctrine of the attributes of God played a large part in mediaeval theology, both Christian and Muslim, and was copiously treated by the schoolmen in connection with the controversy over universals, with theodicy and with free will. The central problem was that of the relation between the unity and transcendence of God and the manifold variety of His attributes. To get rid of all trace of anthropomorphism, the individual attributes were resolved into so many manifestations of the idea of God itself, as an absolute Being or as infinite Love. The religious pre- supposition behind all this speculative activity was the belief in one only God, i.e., monotheism, dogmatised in accordance with the doctrine of revelation. Even when the idea of God and of the attributes of Deity came within the scope of positive investigation and of historical reflexion, the new studies were none the less dominated by the idea of mono- theism. Thus the late L. R. Farnell, in his Gifford lectures delivered in St. Andrews in I924-25 and published in I925 at Oxford under the title The Attributes of God, a work conceived in the spirit of com- parative religion and guided by the concept of evolution, persists in the idea that the notion of a deity having true and proper attributes is to be found only in a quite advanced stage of religious development, being conditioned in its origins by the development of anthropomorph- *) By permission of Messrs.

Pettazzoni ism, such as characterises the polytheistic cults, and then fully realised only with the attribution to God of moral qualities, the monotheistic religions. As to omniscience in particular, Farnell supposes that a kind of knowledge or wisdom is ascribed to deity even "in the lower stages of culture", "but it may be long before a clear conception of omni- science is reached as an essential faculty and attribute of high divinity. In some of the polytheisms of the cultured peoples we by no means find omniscience or even a high degree of wisdom attributed to each deity alike." He adds (I quote from p. 214 sqq. of the book just mentioned) that even at the top of the ascent "omniscience is not a concept that the sacred texts of the monotheistic religions tend to emphasize". Yet, before the last century was over, there had been noticed among savage peoples, indeed among some of the most primitive, the concept of a Supreme Being endowed with omniscience and the other chief attributes; and this idea had also been exploited, by Andrew Lang, in the direction of monotheism, although from the opposite point of view from Farnell's, that is, the anti-evolutionary. It is true that Lang, interested as he was mostly in criticising the classical theory of religious evolution framed by E. B. Tylor, had spoken of the omni- science, eternity and omnipotence of these Supreme Beings rather as a piece of literary skirmishing, or polemical underlining, than in any strictly scientific sense, as he himself to some extent admitted, after a notable controversy with E. S. Hartland 1), in the preface to the second edition of his book The Making of Religion (London I9o0; the first edition came out in I898, the third in I9IO). But if Lang's monotheism was rather a matter of words than of substance, the idea was soon to be given a precise and systematic shape in the theory of "primitive monotheism" put forward by Father W. Schmidt 2), which aimed at giving positive proof of a primaeval belief in a God infinitely good and sovranly just, which was alleged to be the oldest form of religion attainable by our knowledge. Thus the theological speculations concerning Deity and its attributes appeared reconcilable with the data I) E. S. HARTTLAND, The 'high gods' of Australia, Folk-Lore, 1898, 290-329; A.

The theory of primitive monotheism is founded on an equivocation and on an error. The equivocation consists in calling by the name of monotheism what is nothing of the kind, in mistaking for true mono- theism the savage peoples' idea of Supreme Beings. The error consists in supposing that to be primit've which is not so, in transferring to the most archaic religious culture the idea of God which properly be- longs to our Western civilisation, that which found its way from the Old Testament into the New and was then elaborated by Christianity. Monotheism, in its concrete historical reality, is belief in a single God and the denial of all other gods. As such, it presupposes polytheism, and consequently cannot be the earliest form of religion. This is not to say that monotheism is derived from polytheism by a gradual and inevitable development, as the evolutionist theory would have it. It derives from it, if at all, by revolution, by a radical religious upheaval, the work of some great personality, the herald of a new word. This theory of the formation of monotheism I have set forth and developed on various occasions 3) and most recently in a lecture given at the University of Brussels in 1949 and published under the title La for- mation du monotheisme in the Revue de l'Universite de Bruxelles for I950 (an English version is found in Essays on History of Religions, Leiden I954). What the supporters of the theory of primitive monotheism allege to be the primitive form of religion is not concrete monotheism as it is found in the great monotheistic religions of history, but an abstract monotheism with the attributes which inhere in it according to theo- logical speculation. The Supreme Being of savage peoples is but an approximation to the ideal monotheism. There is a divergence, a dif- ference of less and more, between what is postulated and what the data furnish, and all the efforts of the anthropological arguments to explain 3) R.

Pettazzoni this difference as the result of a secondary degeneration or obscura- tion of the ideal presuppose the existence from the beginning of what does not take shape till later times and under particular historical cir- cumstances. The whole theory springs from a compromise between historical investigation and theology. For the former, the attributes of Deity are not contained a priori in the monotheistic conception of God, for this conception is itself a formation, and the divine attributes likewise are formations, sharing in the development of the conception. One of these attributes, that of omniscience, is the main object of our research; it will be examined here independently of all prejudged monotheistic implication, examined as an ideological complex, a religi- ous structure and a historical growth. To begin with, it is well to state precisely what is really to be under- stood by "divine omniscience". Omniscience does not belong to man, although there are men who have remarkable powers of knowledge; but these are unusual men, of a different condition from the generality, such as were in antiquity the diviners like Kalchas the oionopolos of the Iliad (i, 70), and are the shamans and medicine-men of lower cultures of today, for instance the piay or conjurers of the Carib Arowak, who "know everything", the Dakota medicine-men who see everything even when they are asleep, so that one cannot go near them without being perceived, or the sorcerers of the Lushei Kuki in Northern Burma, who are called puithiam, that is "great knowers", as their colleagues among the Mordvins go by a native name signifying "he (she) who knows" 4). The dead also, that is to say their spirits, know everything. Among the Teton Dakota the ghosts know all things, they know "when the wind will blow, and when there will be rain or heavy thunder clouds". 4) See W. E.

Certain at least of the lower animals also, especially those with the power of flight, "know everything"; they know what is beilg done and said, what the weather will be and how matters will turn cut, as Pliny already remarks in his Natural History (viii, 28). As R. Karsten ex- plains it in his work The Origins of Religion (London 1935, p. 76), "the obvious power of many insects, birds and other animals to foretell the weather may be one of the reasons why primitive peoples generally ascribe to them a prophetic clear-sightedness in other respects". Ac- cording to the Ekoi of the Cameroons, some birds (and f r that matter some people) have "four eyes" and possess the ability to see things invisible to the ordinary man. In a story told by the Elo of the Ora tribe, it is birds who help a lad named Ilefo (i.e., "I know everything"). The Huichol of New Mexico hold that birds, especially eagles and hawks, hear everything, and it is by means of them that the shamans know all that is said, no matter where, even under the earth. The serpent likewise, which lives underground and is often the incarnation of a dead man's spirit, "knows all secrets, is the fountain of wisdom and foresees the future" 6). In all these cases we have to do with a magical or oracular wisdom. In China and elsewhere, all magical knowledge comes from the serpent. The spirits of the dead also possess knowledge of this sort7). The ghost of Samuel is called up by the "witch" of Endor, at the request of Saul, to give knowledge of the future (I Sam. 28, 8sqq.). Such knowledge, call it magical, oracular or divinatory, is ascribed also to divine beings. The wisdom of Odin, "father of magic", is a magical wisdom; the Egyptian Thot possesses all wisdom, it being inherent in his quality as the "great magician" or "lord of magic". In Japanese 5) G.

Pettazzoni Shinto, the god Omohikane, "the thinker", "he who unites in himself the power of thought (of several gods)", is the one to whom the deities resort at the most critical moments, for instance when the world is to be freed from the darkness caused by the goddess Amate- rasu going into the cave (i.e., an eclipse of the sun), or to overcome the powers which oppose the establishment of a descendant of Amate- rasu in the lordship of the Land of the Rising Sun 8). This Omohi- kane, then, who knows how to advise the rest what to do, and thus is master of a superior ability, inherent in thought as a magical force, may well be considered as an idealisation of the conjuror in primitive societies. Oracular wisdom is especially characteristic of certain deities either aquatic or in some way connected with water, like the Baby- lonian Ea, "he who understands everything", "the magician of the gods", who is god of the waters of the depths that flow in the bowels of the earth and possess a secret healing power, made active by the appropriate formulae of conjuration and exorcism. Among the Greeks it is particularly the Muses, the Sirens, Proteus and his daughter Eido- thea, all more or less connected with the element of water, who know all that happens, ever had happened or ever will happen on earth 9). Alongside of this magical and oracular knowledge there is another kind of omniscience which we may term visual, inasmuch as it is based essentially on the power of sight, a knowing which comes from seeing, an 'asIvoL (to know) which is intimately connected with uidere (to see). While magical omniscience is ascribed to beasts, to excepti- onal men, and to sundry spirits, rather than to divine beings, visual omniscience is a specific attribute of deities. Divine omniscience being a visual omniscience shows characteristics of its own which are in- timately connected one with another, so much s as to form a clearly defined ideological complex. We are in a position to sketch this com- plex on the basis of a morphological investigation of the data we have collected, which we will now pass rapidly in review 10). 8) K.

Io) For documentation in detail the reader is referred to the forthcoming book. 6</page><page sequence="7">On the attributes of God Our investigation must first enquire into the subject of Divine omniscience. Of what sort are omniscient deities ? It is natural to think in the first place of the great gods of the historical monotheisms. Om- niscience is an attribute of Yahweh, as it is of Allah, see the Quran, suras vi, 59-60, xxiv, 35, lvii, 4, lix, 22, lxvii, 13-14. "Dost thou not perceive", says the 58th sura, verse 8, "that God knoweth whatever is in heaven and in earth? There is no private discourse among three persons but he is the fourth of them; nor among five, but he is the sixth of them." But the like is said also of Varuna in the Atharva- Veda (iv, 16): "If one stands or goes, or that which two persons seated say to each other, king Varuna is the third and knows it". With Varuna we are in the midst of polytheism; he is an all-knowing god belonging to a polytheistic religion. But savage peoples also have Supreme Beings, some of whom are all-knowing, such as Puluga among the Andamanese, Karei among the Semang, and many more. Thus Divine omniscience proves not to be attached to any particular religious structure, monotheistic, polytheistic or other. Nor can we say that it is in any way a prerogative of Supreme Beings as such, for, e.g., in Greece Helios is omniscient, and he certainly is not one of the chief gods. To sum up, the attribute of omniscience is not inherent in the monotheistic idea of God, nor in that of a Supreme Being, nor again in that of deity in general. It remains to see if it is rooted rather in the peculiar nature of certain definite deities. The plain fact is that according to the evidence it is mostly sky- gods and astral gods, or gods somehow connected with the heavenly realms of light, to whom omniscience is ascribed. This is not to be wondered at, if we remember that, as already mentioned, Divine omni- science is a visual omniscience, which naturally depends upon light (Puluga for instance can see only so long as it is day). The connection in thought between seeing and knowing, which is familiar to students of the classical tongues (o?Sa and uideo), is linguistically proved also outside the Indo-European sphere. In the Hamite languages of the Cushite branch, the words which mean eye, sun, light, know, all come from the same root 11). Among omniscient deities the first place is taken by sky-gods. The Vedic Dyaus, the Greek Zeus, the Latin Juppiter are the best-known ii) E. CERULLI, Rivista degli studi orientali, IO/I925, 621 n. 2. 7</page><page sequence="8">R. Pettazzoni instances and the most obvious, because their very names mean "Sky", "Father Sky". But also Waqa the Supreme Being of the Galla, with his transparent alternation of colour between Black Waqa and White, or Red Waqa, the Sidama deity Yero and other similar figures of the Cushite world, are no other than the sky itself. Similarly, among the Nilotic Hamites, Tororut among the Suk and Ngai among the Masai; among the blacks of the Guinea Coast and of Nigeria, the Ashanti Njame, the Ewe Mawu, the Nupe Soko and their like are at one and the same time "God" and "sky". So likewise Num among the Samoyeds, Tengri among the people of the Altai, the Chinese Tien and the Eskimo Sila, and others again, are "sky". All these sky-gods are omniscient. To them we must add a great many more who, if their names are not so transparent, still are assuredly proved by various indications to be sky-gods likewise, and likewise possessed of all knowledge. One of the most significant traits in which this visual omniscience of sky-gods expresses itself is that they are equipped with eyes which are the stars, or else the sun and moon. As for the stars as eyes of the sky itself, this is a quite wide-spread notion. Among the ancient Mexicans it even found expression in art, in the so-called Codices of their picture-writing, which include some representations of the heavens as dotted with eyes. It still survives among the present-day inhabitants of Mexico, as the Cora and Huichol. Among the Wiyot or Wishosk of central California the stars are called "eyes of the sky". Among the Alacaluf of Tierra del Fuego they are the eyes of Xolas, their Supreme Being. Likewise among the Cashinawa (Western Amazon basin), the stars are the eyes of the sky-Being. Sometimes it is certain particular stars which are his eyes. Thus, among the eastern Pomo in California the stars in general are supposed to be eyes, but the polestar is the eye of Marumda, the Supreme Being. In ancient Peru the seven Pleiades were the eyes of Viracocha. In the central district of the island of Flores the stars are the eyes of Dua Nggae the Supreme Being, who is thought of as being the pair Heaven and Earth. Among the Masai, who are Nilotic Hamites, the stars are the eyes of Ngai, the chief sky-god, and a falling star is one of his eyes which is coming nearer the earth in order to see better. But besides the stars the heavens have other eyes. The stars serve 8</page><page sequence="9">On the attributes of God to see by night, but not by day. According to the Masai, Ngai sees with them at night, but in the daytime the sun is his eye. More com- monly the daily and nightly vision are divided between the two great eyes of heaven, i.e., the two larger luminaries, the sun by day and the moon by night. For the Tlinkit on the north-west Pacific coast of North America, sun and moon are "the eyes of the sky", and the same idea is found in the Polynesian mythology, sun and moon being thought of as the eyes either of the sky (New Zealand) or of a supreme sky-god. The Samoyed sky-god Num has the sun and moon for eyes, the sun being his good and the moon his bad eye. Among the Batek (Semang of Pahang on the peninsula of Malacca), the sun is the right and the moon the left eye of the sky-god Keto. The idea is already found in ancient Egypt, where the old sky-god Horus has the sun and moon for eyes and Amun, god of the weather-sky, has the sun for his right, the moon for his left eye, while the wind is the breath issuing from his nostrils. In the Japanese cosmogonic myth of Iza- nangi and Izanami, who are the ancient cosmic pair, Father Sky and Mother Earth, the water with which Izanagi washes his left eye gives birth to Amaterasu the sun-goddess, and that with which he washes his right eye to Tsuki-Yomi, god of the moon, while that in which he washes his nose produces Susanowo, god of the storm-wind. The same motif is found again in the Chinese myth of P'anku, founded upon the idea that the elements and the constituent parts of the universe are the members or organs of a gigantic primaeval being, such as P'anku is, whose eyes become the sun and moon (left and right eye respect- ively). Such also is the Vedic Purusha, from whose eye the sun is born, from his mind the moon, from his breath the wind (Vayu), and so on (Rg-Veda x, go, I3), also Brahman in the Atharva-Veda (v, Io, 7, 33) and Prajapati in the Satapatha-Brahmana (vii, I, 2, 7), whose eyes are the sun and moon. In Orphism also we find the idea of the sun and moon being the eyes of Zeus, that is of the universe, of which the sky is the head. But even separately and independently of one another, the sun and the moon are often all-seeing and all-knowing deities on their own account (or on behalf of others, for example of the Supreme Being), each as a single eye or a single person. In the central district of the island of Flores, the moon is thought of as Mata rica, i.e., "Great Eye". Selene the moon goddess is for the Greeks the eye of evening (Pin- 9</page><page sequence="10">R. Pettazzoni dar), or of night (Aeschylus), and is at the same time a personal, all- seeing goddess. The Egyptian Thot has, besides an omniscience of the magical kind, a visual omniscience inherent in his character of a lunar god, "the bull of the heavens", "the'bull among the stars". In Meso- potamia the moon-god Sin (Nanna in Sumerian) knows all. The sun also is an eye, Senq, among the Bellacoola Indians; the solar rays are his eyelashes. To the Mayoruna of Brazil, he is the "spirit in the sky", and his very name, Pioki, means precisely "eye". Otherwise the sun is the eye of heaven, or of the sky-god (Wa'a among the Hadiya), or of the Supreme Being (the Great Spirit of the Choctaw, Pue-mpalaburu among the Toradja of Celebes). Or, the sun itself is thought of as a personal being of universal powers of sight (Shamash in Babylonia, Surya in the Vedas, Helios in Homer). Sky and sun, moon and stars, deities especially luminous, are also deities especially endowed with omniscience. This is but natural, seeing that without light vision is impossible, and on that the omniscience which comes from universal vision depends. It is true that omniscience is attributed also to other deities of various kinds. In the Babylonian pantheon, the epithet df "all-seeing" (mudu kalama, mudu mimma shumshu) is given not only to Enlil, Marduk or Shamash, but also to Nabu, Nergal and other divinities. Similarly, in the Vedic pantheon, the epithet of vis'vavedas, or all-knowing, is indeed the especial property of Dyaus, Varuna, Mitra-Varuna and Surya, but it is bestowed no less on many other gods. It would however be unsafe to infer from this that the attribute of omniscience is implicit in the notion of divinity itself, and so may be predicated of every divine being. We must take into account the possibility that this attribute was generalised by extension from its original sphere, that of the deities of light, to others of different nature. In certain instances the generalisation is patent. For example, the Adityas are collectively visvavedas, but the two principal ones, Mitra and Varuna, are so individually as well; it is likely that their characteristic of omniscience has been extended to other members of the group, who of themselves are not all-knowing. Assuredly this process has worked on a larger scale. Generally speaking, omniscient (or all-seeing) deities are gods who are such in the true etymological Indo-European sense of that word, devas, daevas, di, that is to say bright or luminous beings. If then deva passed into 10</page><page sequence="11">On the attributes of God the sense of "god" in general 12), this development helps us to see, by analogy, how the universal knowledge, or vision, characterising the "bright" deities came afterwards to be predicated of all other divine beings as well. The wind also is credited with omniscience. The Egyptian Amun, the Babylonian Enlil are all-knowing gods; as wind-gods they are in- visible, like Kot among the Nuer, Dyuok among the Luo, and others, like the breath or spirit (ruach) of Yahweh and the pneuma in the Gospel of St. John, of which "thou hearest the sound, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth" (John 3, 8). Wind does not properly belong to the region of light, but being a weather- phenomenon it belongs to the precincts of the sky, and thus its omni- science is of the same nature as that of the Sky-Beings, i.e. a visual omniscience. According to the Ngadha of Flores the winds are provided with eyes to see (and with ears to hear). In the Rg-Veda Vaya, the wind, has thousand eyes as well as Varuna. Omniscience was attributed to Air by Diogenes of Apollonia and to Aether by another Greek philosopher who was the butt of Kratinos in a comedy entitled Panoptai, whose chorus was made up of disciples of that master, thought of as panoptai and masked accordingly, i.e., as "all- seers", after the fashion of Argos Panoptes with his hundred or ten thousand eyes or with his two heads looking different ways (Boreas, the north wind, was also thought of as two-faced). It is interesting to cast an eye on the relations of the wind with the Supreme Sky-Being in the various forms which they take in myths. Sometimes the sky-god himself is no other than the wind. Juok, the omniscient sky-god of the Nilotic Shilluk and Lango, is the wind, air in motion. Muri Kraeng among the natives of West Flores is "like the wind". Lungkitsumba among the Ao Naga is "like a man, but behaves like a wind". More frequently, the wind is a manifestation of the supreme sky-god; e.g. of Lowalangi among the islanders of Nias, of Puempalaburu among the Toradja of Celebes. For the Masai, it is the breath of Ngai; to the Mordvins, it is Skaj sighing, and to the Pawnee, the breath of Tirawa. The Tsimshian suppose it to be the 12) If in the Avesta daiva means a demon, that happens because it was originally the name of the polytheistic gods before Zarathustra, in whose system they were of necessity degraded to devils. II</page><page sequence="12">R. Pettazzoni breath of Semagid laxha (the Chief up above). Elsewhere, it is the breath from the nostrils of some immense being, whose eyes are the sun and moon; such a one is Sihai at Nias, Amun in ancient Egypt, and their like. To the Naskapi of Labrador, a stormy wind which bends the treetops is as it were a comb with which the Great Spirit is combing them as one does to children. In and with the wind Sky fertilises Earth, hence the typical pair, Earth and Heaven, is sometimes replaced by Earth and Wind. Indeed, among the Alfuri of Minahassa, Lumimuut (Earth) is fertilised by the west wind (the N.-W. mon- soon), which is a manifestation of Kalangi, the Heavenly One; while on the northern coast of New Guinea, women are got with child by Wunekau by means of the wind, and in New Zealand the breath of Iho could make sterile women fertile as it did to the first woman, born of Earth at the beginning of things. Furthermore, the wind may be the instrument which the sky-god uses to expose the wrong-doings of mankind; among the Ao Naga, if the wind strips off the straw thatch of the hut of anyone who has taken an oath, it is a sign that he has sworn falsely 13). When thought of as a person, the wind is often a son of the Sky. Among the offspring of Rangi and Papa who forced apart their parents, locked in a cosmic embrace, there was one who followed Father Sky to his dwelling above, and that was Tawhiri Matea, god of the wind. As a person, the wind is also the sky's messenger (on Chinese divining-bones, the wind is the messenger of Ti); he is the sky-god's newsman, who, passing everywhere, sees and hears all that goes on and brings him word of it. "Since I am everywhere present", says Air in a fragment of Philemon, "I must needs know all things". Among the White Mountain Apache, certain winds are the spies of the Supreme Being. The Bachama of northern Nigeria hold that all that occurs is reported to Nzeanzo by the wind. A saying current among the Akan in the hinterland of the Ivory Coast runs "If you want to say anything to God (literally, "to the sky"), tell it to the wind" 14). Thus the omniscience of the wind, belonging as it does to its ubiquity and being in the service of the sky-god, proves to be simply the omniscience of the sky itself, which manifests itself in 13) J. P. MILLS, The Lhota Nagas, London 1922, 103. 14) C. K. MEEK, Africa, 3/I930, 323; D. WESTERMANN, ibid., I/I928, 203-04. 12</page><page sequence="13">On the attributes of God the wind. Indeed, the faculty of being present everywhere although unseen is predicated of many African Supreme Beings, Gamab, Nsambi, Owase, Rivimbi, Leza, Nguruhi, Wele (or Were), Imana, Jwok and Wende, and in like manner of the Mordvin Skaj, the Tungus Boa, the Chinese Tien, Lowalangi on Nias, Dua Nggae on Flores, Tezcatlipoca, Amun, Aer-Zeus, and many more. The theory here put forward, that the attribute of omniscience is not originally implicit in the idea of deity generally, but organically connected with the peculiar nature of all-knowing gods, who are all- knowing because all-seeing and all-seeing because they are luminous, as being in the first place sky-gods and divinities of the expanses of heaven, - this theory, I say, gets considerable support from the fact that omniscience is not attributed to sundry other deities whose nature is not of light, chiefly the divinities of the earth and the underworld. For the earth is dark and shadowy, and in its obscure depths the creatures of the earliest days grope about until the moment when the appearance of light puts an end to chaos and begins the cosmos. The omniscience of Earth, when it occurs at all, is of magic or oracular kind, like that of the waters which flow in the depths, or that of the dead whose home is in the underworld, or of vapours exhaling from beneath the ground, which in Hellenistic speculations inspired the Pythia to give oracular responses in the ancient shrine of Ge-Themis at Delphoi 15). An oath by the earth, such as occurs for instance in Africa from Guinea to the Congo, is essentially a piece of magic, in which, as in the ordeal by water, 'fire and other means, the earth is not so much a deity who can, like the Sun, guarantee the truth of the swearer because she knows everything and is acquainted even with the innermost thoughts, but rather the instrument of a punitive sanction to which the false swearer exposes himself 16). Thus, he may be swallowed up in the earth, o- may see it gape at his feet. So also in the Homeric oaths, Earth is not named by herself but only in com- bination with Zeus and Helios (so Iliad iii, 278, xix, 259), or else with 15) A. P.

I3</page><page sequence="14">the Sky (Uranos), as in Iliad xv, 36 sq. She is not on a par with these bright and therefore all-seeing deities, but rather with those powers of the underworld or of water who are named in the same oaths, such as the Erinyes, the river Styx, or rivers in general 17). In the oath by Earth and Zeus in Euripides (Elect. II77sq.) or by "Zeus Horkios and the earth we tread upon" (Hippol. I025), Earth merely shares in the omniscience which really belongs to Zeus, or to the sky, exactly as, in some Supreme Beings who are "one and two", and who represent the unity of the universe arising from the duality of sky and earth (such as Gawang, "earth-sky", among the Konyak Naga, Apna-Apha, "our-father-our-mother" at Oirata in the island of Kisar, and the like), it is the Sky who is the bearer of the omniscience, which reverts from him to the other member of the pair, Earth. As for the Mother Earth, who is the supreme deity o.f the ancient Mediterranean religion, even for that deity we have no positive evidence that she is all-knowing. We are not told that omniscience was attributed to the Anatolian Kybele, the Cretan Rhea nor the Greek Demeter. The last is so far from knowing everything that she does not even know where to find her kidnapped daughter, and to learn this must apply to the Sun, exactly as, in a myth of the Achomawi, the Sun is applied to in order to learn where a person who has been carried off is. We must now proceed with our morphological examination, passing from the morphology of the subject, that is of the all-knowing deities, to that of the object of Divine omniscience. What is it that these all- knowing beings know? Here again we shall find that theory is one thing, reality another. To one who looks at the subject, it may seem that every deity must be omniscient, but, as we have found, that is not so; and similarly, when we look at the object, an all-knowing deity ought theoretically to know everything, but in fact, as we shall see, it is not so. As the attribute of omniscience is peculiar, in concrete fact, to certain specific deities, and not common to all, so in concrete fact Divine omniscience has its own precise and characteristic object. E. S. Hartland was quite right when, in opposition to the exaltation, in words at least, of the "high gods of low races" by their "discoverer" Andrew Lang, he reduced their attributes, including omniscience, to 17) Greek oaths, NILSSON, Geschichte der griechischen Religion I, Munich I94I, I30sqq.; E.

In con- sequence, he was right in denying that Baiame is omniscient, from the fact that Baiame could, for example, be deceived by Daramulun. Logically, omniscience cannot but be total and absolute; partial, relative omniscience is a contradiction in terms, and this is as true for primitive thought as for ours. Yet there is a difference between omniscience as we conceive it and the omniscience which primitive thought conceives. Only, this difference is not one of quantity but of kind. For the primitive thinker, omniscience is quantitatively neither relative nor absolute, for that question does not occur to him19). It is qualitatively relative by virtue of its visual nature, which of necessity subordinates it to visibility and so to the presence of light (thus, Puluga is all-knowing only by day; lightning is a lighted string thrown by Karei to enable him to see at night also, and so on). But Divine omniscience is chiefly relative in its object, for that is not the whole of what can be known, but a particular, well-defined object. The especial object of Divine omniscience is man and his conduct, man and his activities. Throughout the Old Testament, but particularly in the Psalms and in the Wisdom literature, the omniscience of Yahweh is exalted, not so much the knowledge He possesses as Creator, as the God who knows the world because He made it, as His knowledge of all that men do. The Lord beholds from the sky the good and bad actions of mankind (Hosea vii, 2). Not for an instant can man avoid the sight of Yahweh, and there is no place where he can hide from Him. All his life, day by day, lies open to the eyes of the Lord. Only the impious do not believe in God's omniscience, and only the wicked deludes himself with the hope of escaping His all-seeing regard. Similar ideas and like motifs occur among many other peoples 20). In the course of our in- vestigation evidence of this will be found on every page. Knowledge of what human beings do is predicated of Amun, of Shamash, of Varuna i8) E. S. HARTLAND, Folk-Lore I899, 304, 314. For other instances of relative omniscience see my article in ARW 29/I93I, 109, 230 (Puluga and Olelbis). I9) In the Andamanese language no distinction is made between 'all' and 'many (much)', so that the same phrase can mean "Puluga knows much" and "Puluga knows everything": A. R. BROWN, The Andaman Islanders, Cambridge 1922, I59. 20) The theme, e.g., of the sinner who imagines he is not seen is found again, for instance, among the Akan, in Ashanti, and elsewhere.

Pettazzoni and Mitra-Varuna, Zeus and Helios, Juppiter, Tien and Shang-ti, of Iho, Lowalangi, Upu Lanito, Wonekau, Puluga, Karei, Manitou, Oki, Tezcatlipoca and others. Most frequently, it is bad actions which are the object of Divine omniscience. Sometimes they are specifically mentioned. Nyalich, the Dinka Supreme Being, sees murderers and robbers. The ill-usage of beasts is strictly checked by the Chief Up Above among the Tsimshian, and by Sila-Pinga among the Eskimo, and similarly, the needless slaughtering or tormenting of game by the Cree and Montagnais Supreme Beings. Puluga in the Andamans is angry when he sees anyone quarter a boar badly or uproot tubers at the wrong season. Often it is sexual offences which are the particular object of Divine omniscience; adultery, not only in the Book of Job and the Wisdom of ben Sirach, but also among the Bahau of Borneo, the Flores islan- ders (along with theft), and others; incest among the natives of Nias, the Toradja of Celebes, the Ngadha of Flores, the Goajiro of Colum- bia, the Cuna of Panama, the Mundurucui of Brasil; bestiality among the Toradja and others. Not only what men do but what they say is an object of Divine omniscience. To hear all that is said is an obvious complement of seeing all that is done. Universal hearing joins universal vision to make up a complete omniscience. This is not to weaken the essentially visual character of omniscience, because universal hearing is merely a second- ary amplification of it, the fruit of a reflecting and distinguishing thought. The notion that there is no meeting of men at which God is not present to hear their words is as old as the Vedas, as already mentioned (p. 7). Yahweh hears everything; as the Wisdom of Solo- mon has it (I, Io), "the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise of murmurings is not hid." Ptah hears and sees everything; Ea is Lord of the Ear, as the vehicle of understanding. Universal hearing is attributed to Temaukel among the Ona-Selknam, and to the Sun among the Dakota and the Tarascos ("our Father Sun" hears when anyone tells a lie), to Thunder as the Supreme Being of the Nisenan and Ponka, to Ne Nanatch among the Gros Ventres, and to Yuttoere among the Carrier Indians (who tell an unruly child that "Yuttoere is listening to you"). Frequently, in savage beliefs, we find universal sight and hearing together as associated attributes of the Supreme Being, whether sky- I6</page><page sequence="17">On the attributes of God god or sungod. Among the Chipewyans, who are eastern Dene, Yed- dariye sees and hears from the height of heaven all that is done or said on earth. Among the Iroquois, the great Oki in the sky does the same. Among the Hupa, the Sun sees and hears all. In China it is Shang-ti who observes and hears, and Tien, thanks to his sight and hearing, is aware of all that happens on earth. Among the Konyak Naga, Gawang ("Earth-Sky") is all-seeing and all-hearing, and the same holds good for Lowalangi on Nias, Wonekau in northern New Guinea, and Kasiwa on the island of Nukumanu (Micronesia). The Pygmies of Ituri hold that Tore "sees us all who are sitting here and hears what we say", and much the same is true of Gamab, according to the Damara. A saying of the Wa-Nyika runs, "Almost before you raise your voice, Mulungu hears you, and even if you hide in a cave, Mulungu sees you". In like manner, among the Shambala, Mulungu sees and hears everything, while the Tshi of the Gold Coast believe the same concerning Nyankupon. In Homer it is Helios who "observes all and hears all" (Iliad iii, 277). The Greek philosophers customarily add universal understanding to universal sight and hearing as an attribute of deity. This triple omniscience is attributed to his God by Xenophanes (frg. 24 Diels), by Kritias the sophist to his daimon (frg. 25 Diels), by Sokrates, Plato and Xenophon to the gods generally, by Hippokrates to the ether and by the Orphics still to the ether, but as an organ of Zeus. The Chitimacha hold that the Great Spirit sees, understands and knows everything, but yet has neither eyes nor ears. Generally, how- ever, universal vision and sight are ascribed to omniscient beings in a concrete form, as due to the eyes and ears which are assigned to them 21). Naturally, these are no common eyes or ears. According to the Wisdom of ben Sirach, "the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun" (Eccles. xxiii, I9). Elsewhere they are of extraordinary size; such are the "great eyes" of Skaj among the Mordvins, the eyes "as large as lakes" or "as large as the river Ob" with which the Finnish-Ugrian Torem sees everything, and the ears "as big as waterlily pads" wherewith he hears everything. Leza has very long ears, with which he can hear even talk that is murmured in secret; while the ears of the Samoyed Num are the stars. 2I) The winds too have ears to hear and eyes to see, according to the Ngadha on the island of Flores. 17 NUMEN, II 2</page><page sequence="18">R. Pettazzoni More commonly the abnormality is a matter of quantity, the eyes and ears being more numerous than is usual, and divided among the suitably large number of heads, or scattered all over the body. Amon- Re is said to have many pairs of eyes; again in Ancient Egypt the Sun, as Lord of millions and millions of years, has seventy-seven eyes and seventy-seven ears. Osiris has many eyes according to the ety- mology of his name given by Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch, and Isis also is roXu6po0acktIo in an Oxyrhynchos papyrus. The figure com- monly called Bes Pantheos has the body sprinkled with eyes, while certain stelae at Memphis and Thebes, dedicated to Ptah and other Egyptian deities, show ears in great profusion (as many as 42, 110 and 376) and eyes numbering four as a rule. The Enuma elish states that Marduk (and before him perhaps the Sumerian Enlil, as later the Assyrian Assur) had "four eyes" and "four ears", while a deity with two faces and accordingly furnished with four eyes is often shown on seals and on some Babylonian statuettes. Varuna has "a thousand eyes", Indra, Agni and Purusa are sahasraksa; Indra's eyes are dotted about his body. Varuna is also caturanika in the Rg-Veda, that is four-faced. As early as Mohenjo-Daro we find on a seal a god with three faces, and many heads are an outstanding characteristic of the cult-images of Hinduism, Brahma, Siva, Vishnu, and of those of Buddhism (Avalokitesvara and others). With this goes a third eye on the forehead of the numerous heads; there may be three or four, five, ten, twenty-five heads or more. A thousand, or ten thousand eyes are attributed to Mithra in the Avesta and six (probably contained in three heads) to Saosyant in the Denkart. The sun has three pairs of eyes according to a Hittite text of the second millennium B.C., and three faces on a bronze vase from Hamadan, dating from the twelfth century of our era. We hear in Philon of Byblos, as cited by Eusebios, that the Phoenician god El, rendered in Greek by Kronos, had four eyes, two in front and two behind, which opened and shut by turns; and this finds confirmation from art in some coins of Mallos in Kilikia which show a winged figure with two-faced head. The cherubim in the vision of Ezekiel had their bodies and wings covered with eyes; Satan in the Talmud and the Son of Man in the Nahassenian tradition have eyes in their bodies. In an amatory epigram ascribed to Plato, we hear of the many eyes of Uranos, i.e., heaven. Argos Panoptes had "many" or "a hundred" or "ten thousand" eyes, or, according to the I8</page><page sequence="19">On the attributes of God Aigimios, four, presumably distributed between two faces, for we actually find him two-faced on some vases. In one he has in addition eyes all over his body, and that was how Kratinos conceived of his panoptai, that is the followers of a philosophic school of which he was making fun in the comedy with that title (see above, p. ii). Boreas, the north wind, is shown two-faced on a red-figure vase. Pherekydes says Argos had three eyes, the third being on the nape of the neck, and a xoanon or archaic statue of Zeus with three eyes, the third being on the forehead, is said by Pausanias to have been kept on the acro- polis of Argos. We hear also of a Zeus and an Apollo tetraotos, i.e. four-eared. Janus has two or sometimes four faces. A Gaulish god with three heads or faces is shown on many votive stelae and the so- called planetary vases. The Rider of the Thracian votive stelae has sometimes two or three heads. A three-headed god is depicted on one of the golden trumpets from Gallehus in Denmark. The pagan Slavs of the Baltic had many-headed figures, Triglav at Stettin with three, Svantevit with four at Arkona, and Rugievit, Porenut, Porevit (at Arkona) with four, five or seven heads. Among the Samoyeds, idols of Weesakko with three or seven heads are found. Tortali, the Sun, is many-eyed in a story from the island of Pente- cost in the New Hebrides. At Nauru in the Gilberts Damamak has eyes in his forehead, on his temples and on the back of his head. Mata-walu or Maka-walu, both meaning "eight-eyed", is an epithet shared by various figures of Polynesian myth, Maui among the Maori of New Zealand, Kamapua and Pea-pea in Hawaii, and we may add the Fijian Mataiwalu on the island of Somo-Somo, and Mata-rau, "he of the two hundred eyes", as a name of Tonga-iti, one of the sons of Vatea and Papa in the Cook Islands. Wonekau, a solar Supreme Being on the north coast of New Guinea, carries a two-faced figurine on his head. A deity of the Kamilaroi in Australia has countless eyes and ears. Among the Cora of New Mexico, Tetewan, goddess of he night sky and the lower world, has many "sights", presumably eyes, looking every way, and the same is said of Hatsikan, the Morning Star. The Pijao, a Chibcha speaking tribe of northern Columbia, had a monu- mental figure of a god called Lulumoy with three heads, six arms and six legs. A typical figure of the Tiahuanaco culture is at times shown on pottery of the Nazca style with several heads. A Nenechen with two faces is recorded among the Araucanian Mapuche. Thunder, as a I9</page><page sequence="20">representative of the god of the weather-sky, has one face in front and another behind among the Huchnom or inland Yuki. Thus we find that plurality of eyes or heads is often enough an expression in words or in art of a general idea of the extraordinary and limitless powers of sight and hearing and the consequent omni- science of certain deities. This does not mean that it is always so. To have many heads or eyes is not an exclusive characteristic of omni- scient beings nor consequently a mark of the celestial character (or solar, or both) on which their omniscience depends. Often enough, on the contrary, the multiplicity of heads or eyes, like that of any other parts of the body (cf. the Hekatoncheires, or hundred-handed giants, in Hesiod, Typhon in Ovid, Met. iii, 303, and so forth), means no more than monstrosity, or non-human nature, and is not properly speaking divine but rather demoniacal. However the fact remains that to have many eyes, or heads, or both, as an expression of universal vision, is a strong indication, if supported by others, of the celestial or solar nature of beings so equipped. Divine omniscience has another field of activity; besides the deeds and besides the words of mankind, it examines even their inmost thoughts and secret intents. In the prophecies of Jeremiah we are told that the Lord tries "the reins and the heart" (Jer. xi, 20). The same thought is found among many other peoples, savage and civilised. Karai Kasang, the Kachin Supreme Being, "sees" even what men think. The Haida say that everything we think is known to Sins sganagwa. The Great Manitu of the Arikara knows everything, in- cluding the most secret thoughts. Tezcatlipoca knows men's heart; Temaukel, the Supreme Being of the Ona-Selknam, knows even our thoughts and most private intentions. In Babylonia, the god Enlil knows the hearts of gods and men, and Shamash sees to the bottom of the human heart. Zeus likewise knows every man's thought and soul. These omniscient beings do not confine themselves to simply looking at human actions as mere spectators, taking a passive part. They generally exercise a sanction, which should mean rewarding or punish- ing according to the nature of the actions themselves; but in fact the stress is much oftener laid on punishment, reward being heard of only in a very few cases. Hence the sanction exercised by all- knowing deities is generally punitive. Ill-treatment of beasts, waste of R. Pettazzoni 20</page><page sequence="21">On the attributes of God food, incest and other sexual offences, perjury and in general the violation of the tribal rules are among the deeds likeliest to draw down punishment from the gods. As a general rule, the punishment is not sent at random, but fits the nature of the omniscient beings (celestial, or solar, or both) on which their omniscience depends. Indeed, their vengeance is generally wreaked by means of the weather. The punish- ment sent by Zeus upon men who, gathering in assemblies, judge crooked dooms, is no other than a violent storm, Iliad xvi, 384 sqq. The statue of Zeus Horkios at Olympia held a thunderbolt in either hand to smite false swearers. At Rome, Juppiter's vengeance was sent by means of thunder. Solemn oaths were taken in the name of Iuppiter Lapis, and the lapis in question was a thunder-stone, so that swearing by that god amounted to exposing oneself, if the oath was not kept, to the penalty of being thunderstruck. Among the Altaic tribes, Tengri, the Sky, punishes men's misdoings with bad weather. In China also Ti-en (again the Sky) uses means furnished by the weather, thunder- bolts, thunder, deluges of rain and consequent floods and famines. On the Andamans, Puluga punishes with thunder and lightning, bad weather and storm. Lowalangi sends torrential rains to chastise incest. The same means are used to set their punitive sanctions in action by Petara and Nanju in Borneo, "Deva" on Flores, Wonekau on the north coast of New Guinea. The Eskimo Sila sends bad weather as a punishment. The Tsimshian's "Chief up above" sends snowstorms. The Supreme Being of the Apache likewise uses meteorological means, and the Iroquois say that the Oki of the sky lays waste their crops with storms and floods. Among the Ponka it is Thunder himself who inter- poses his vengeance, and the Aztec Tezcatlipoca is closely connected with the thunderbolt, as his Maya equivalent Hunrakan is with storms. Viracocha also punishes with thunderbolts and deluges, Mareigua among the Goajiro wields the thunderbolt against the incestuous, and rain and thunder mark the wrath of Maret Khmakniam, the Supreme Being of the Botocudos. The Yahgan of Tierra del Fuego believed in a Supreme Being who punished misdoings with bad weather. This is what we may call the rule, but the punishment is not always of a meteorological kind. Sometimes it consists of or includes calamities of another kind, such as floods (Tien), deluges (Wonekau and Aluelap), earthquakes (Muri Kraeng), ill success in hunting (Gawang, Sila, and the Supreme Being of the Cree-Montagnais), bad harvests and famine (Gawang, Tien, Tamei Tinggei), disease and deaths (Gawang, the Apache Supreme Being, Tezcatlipoca, and Teu- 21</page><page sequence="22">R. Pettazzoni maukel and Xolas in Tierra del Fuego), or the death of cattle (so among the Suk). But here we must not forget that floods and deluges mostly result from rains, that hunting turns out badly when the weather is bad, and crops are scanty after too much rain or prolonged drought. All these plagues therefore are meteorological in their nature, and some forms of death and disease have the same source, for instance the deaths due to rain by will of the Supreme Being among the north-western Bushmen, as recorded by Lebzelter in Fest- schrift Pater W. Schmidt, Vienna 1928, 409, or the sharp stabbing pains which the Jahai Semang of the Malacca peninsula say are caused by a splinter of thunderbolt lodged in the chest, as Schebesta informs us in Archiv fiir Religions- wissenschaft xxviii (1926), 221. To sum up, we now find that we have a clear picture of the original ideological complex of Divine omniscience. Its subject is not primarily deity in general, but a determinate category of divine beings. Its object is not the whole range of knowledge, but man and his doings. The manner in which Divine omniscience comes about is quite definite, for it is founded upon a power of universal vision, complemented on occasion by similar powers of hearing, by omnipresence and the like. Moreover this Divine omniscience is not merely passive and contem- plative, but gives rise to a sanction, generally punitive, which in its turn is not of any and every kind, for usually its instrument is the weather. These elements which make up the complex of Divine omni- science, subject and object, purpose and method, conditions and effects, have an organic connection with one another. An internal logic joins the luminous nature olf the omniscient beings with the powers of sight on which their universal knowledge depends, the visibility (from above) of human actions (also the audibility of human speech and so on), and the meteorological nature of the sanction which is attached. By virtue of this internal correlation and interdependence of its com- ponent parts, the complex of ideas concerning Divine omniscience is really a complex, that is to say an organic whole, well defined. This ideological complex was not the result of reasoning upon the abstract notion of deity, but the immediate, concrete expression of a manner of thinking which conceives of the divine in terms of anthropo- morphism, and the divine transcendence in the form of a more or less monstrous multiplicity of shape. In this spontaneity, originality and simplicity we clearly see the proper nature of imaginative, that is mythical thought, that "poetical metaphysics" which Vico in the eigh- teenth century ascribed to primitive man. To his "most corporeal imagination", as Vico supposed, the more violent weather-phenomena 22</page><page sequence="23">On the attributes of God suggested the first notion of divinity, when, alarmed by the thunder and lightning, for which he could find no reason, "he lifted his eyes and perceived the heavens; and since in such a case the nature of the human mind tends to ascribe its own nature to what occurs ... men imagined that the sky was a vast animate body, which by reason of this appearance they called Jove ... who by the hiss of the lightning and the roar of the thunder was trying to say something to them" 22). But it was Vico's fate to be overlooked. His ingenious discernment of the true nature of myth did not prevent either F. G. Creuzer's sym- bolism from being grafted, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, on to the ancient trunk of allegorical interpretation of myths, or the anti-mythical spirit which passed from Greek philosophic speculation to Christian apologetics from being reincarnated in our time in the theory of primitive monotheism and being applied to the Divine attributes. Omniscience, according to this theory, belongs 23), together with the other attributes, to the genuine "monotheistic" idea of God, which originally had nothing at all to do with mythical thought, but was the pure conception of a rational thought which looked for a cause of things. The fundamental part which the sky and the weather have played in the earliest notions of God, and his attributes, omni- science included, is for Father Schmidt but a deterioration of the pure monotheistic ideal. Thunder, Wind, Lightning he supposes to be no more than specialised forms of the sky-god, and the identification of the skygod with the sky itself again a secondary phenomenon, the sky having been originally no more than the abode of the Supreme Being, who had essentially nothing to do with the sky, sun or moon, or nature in general, he being the Creator and the world his creature 24). To describe the Supreme Beings of illiterate peoples no term has been found indeed more adequate and better suited to their nature than Andrew Lang's "allfathers" or N. S6derblom's Urheber, or Schmidt's own word Urschbpfer. Yes; but the attribute of creative activity itself 22) G. B. Vico, La Scienza Nuova, Bk. ii, sect. I, chap. I (I p. 147 in F.

Pettazzoni is not independent of myth. So far from belonging to the sphere of transcendent, we might perhaps say meta-mythical, thought, purely logical and causal, these creative Beings are in the very thick of a myth, a myth concerned with the beginnings of things. The character- istic of the myths of beginnings is that they give, not an intellectualist explanation of the universe and its formation, but the very reason for the existence of the world and its order, for the structure and permanence of social life. Creation-myths are a particular form of myths of beginnings. As such, they share in the essential nature of such myths, in their character and their existential value. Creative activity as an attribute of Supreme Beings (though not of them all) is a mythical datum 25). The attribute of creative power already implies that of omni- potence, for creation itself is the work and the sign of a boundless capacity. Connected with it is also the attribute of eternity, which guarantees that the world when created will endure in time. And as it is important that the world should endure as it was originally created, without change or alteration, the Creator is often credited with in- activity, as an expression of his sovran impassivity and indiffer- ence 26). To this central attribute of creative activity Lang wished also to refer that of omniscience 27); but this knowledge, which is really a knowledge of how to act, and in the last analysis the power to act, is characteristic, as we already know (p. 5), of magical omniscience, not visual. Visual omniscience, on the other hand, is to be grouped with wakeful benevolence and just retribution, with absolute equity and morality, a complex essentially different from creativity with its con- joint attributes of omnipotence, eternity, imperturbability (or in- activity). The difference is most pronounced between the "inactive" character of certain Creators, who having finished their creation retire to an inaccessibly far region, and the highly dynamic nature of those all- seeing deities who, keeping a check on everything that men do, intervene to smite sinners with the weapons of the weather, deluges or what not. Such a dualism has a certain distant resemblance to the 25) See my paper, Myths of Beginnings and Creation Myths, in Essays on the History of Religions, Leiden 1954, 24-36. 26) See the paper cited in the last note. 27) "Power may take the form of all-seeing", LANG, Folk-Lore, I899, Io. 24</page><page sequence="25">On the attributes of God schoolmen's classification of the attributes of God into positive and negative, whereof the former sprang from potentialising to the highest degree the capacities und virtues of man, as understanding, goodness, truth, the latter originated from a thorough-going negation of human limitations, and so included uncreated eternity, infinity, immutability, invisibility and ineffability. This dualism, then, between the two groups of Divine attributes thus differentiated, has its positive and concrete raison d'etre in a different polarisation resulting from two religious tendencies. On the one hand we have the world and the origin of the world, which is the specific object of those attributes which are centered on creative activity; on the other, man and his behaviour, which are the specific object of omniscience and all the attributes which go with it. On the one hand, the creation of the world-order and its preservation in statu quo is the primary condition, the guarantee, of the existence of the universe, its duration and stability; on the other, we have the foundations of the social order and its repair when it has been violated by men and their misdoings. To violation of the rules of tribal life, conceived as a suspension of human order and a temporary relapse into the chaos of primaeval barbarism, corresponds a suspension of the cosmic order, a relapse into primaeval chaos through the unchaining of the elements of violence contained in atmospheric phenomena and the cataclysms which follow. These two religious tendencies may now and then converge, and the attri- butes of the two corresponding groups be concentrated in the person of a single Supreme Being who is the eternal and impassible Creator and at the same time omniscient, watchful, and avenging. Thus Yah- weh, who created the world, also sends the Deluge. But in other cases the tendencies are felt and satisfied separately, and so we get Creators who are not omniscient (such as Mother Earth, above, p. I3), nor good (e.g. the Coyote), and so on, or on the other hand omniscient Beings who avenge but are not creators, such as Zeus, Juppiter, Helios and others. Corresponding to this specific character of the attribute of omni- science, which is inherent in its particular object, human activities, there is a specific religious experience. This is different from the ex- perience which gives rise to the attribute of creativity; it is not, or not merely, the elemental, existential anxiety which finds expression in myths of the beginnings and of creation, but a different experience, 25</page><page sequence="26">R.

This is the experience which for instance among the Apache causes anyone with a troubled conscience to feel a vague disquiet at the approach of the rainy season and the frequent thunder-storms which it brings with it. It is the experience which has given the Ewe the idea that "God is wherever the sky is", the experience of the boundless, horizonless expanse of whiteness which among the Eskimo finds concrete expression in the vague notion of Sila, and of the Australian desert, which can still so impress a European explorer as to move him to declare that the sky nowhere else seems so close, especially at night, when it appears to come down till one can almost touch it 29). Anton Chekov had that feeling when he wrote his fascinating description of the steppe. "When for a long time, without turning your gaze aside, you fix your eyes on the depths of the heavens, it comes about that the mind and soul melt in a feeling of loneliness.
