Pp. 306. Catania: Universita di Catania, 1989. Paper. This is a very worthy contribution to the duller side of the study of later Neoplatonism, and though not very original, is valuable because of its completeness, thoroughness, and careful organisation of the available material. It is the first complete collection of the Fontes for Plutarch of Athens, the founder and organizer of the Neoplatonic School of Athens (which of course had no connection with Plato's long defunct Academy). It is well done and carefully arranged. As might be expected from recent work, Plutarch emerges as typical of his time and as such not so interesting as if he was in any way exceptional. He was, it seems clear from the sources, a moderate Iamblichean, who placed the new School of Athens firmly in the camp of the ' Syrian' variety of Neoplatonism (where of course we always knew it was from his successors Syrianus and Proclus onwards). Taormina, in her long introduction and extensive commentary, deals effectively with the attempts of Beutler and Evrard to make him more interesting by presenting him as a belated example of the influence of Plotinus and Porphyry. She makes good use of recent work, notably that of H. J. Blumenthal. Ludlow A. H. ARMSTRONG ROBERT TURCAN: Religion Romaine. Part 1: Les Dieux; Part 2: Le Culte. (Iconography of Religions, 17.1.) One volume in two parts. Pp. v + 48 (part 1), v + 39 (part 2); 52 plates in part 1; 52 plates in part 2. Leiden, New York, Copenhagen and Cologne: Brill, 1988. Paper, fl. 96/$ 48. This volume deals with the traditional religion of Rome (i.e. 'state' as opposed to 'mystery' cults, which are considered in other volumes): Part One is concerned with 'the gods', Part Two with' the cult'. The format is that established for other volumes in the series: a brief introductory essay and a copious supply of good-quality illustrations, each with its own catalogue entry (there are 140 entries in Part 1, 97 in Part 2). The items illustrated are in the main statues, reliefs and coins, chosen to show a particular deity or aspect of cult practice. My reservations stem mainly from my doubts about the function and intended audience of the series as a whole. Turcan provides an impressive amount of analysis and detail in his introductory essays, which are both thought-provoking and informative. In Part 1 he first examines the contradictory evidence for aniconism and anthropomorphism in early Roman religion. He then points to the pragmatic approach of the Romans to their religion, which sees each deity as having his/her own competence and attributes: this also tends to the creation of an array of allegories and personifications, and to the placing of deities in a precise location in both space and time. Part 2 looks at the importance of cult in Roman religion, an importance that distinguishes it from other religions. The nature of this cult is explored, especially its contractual aspect, and the terms religio, pietas and cultus are clearly explained. Again, priests, cult equipment and actions (including the nature of the sacrifice) are specific to each god, and this specificity is represented with precision in artistic illustrations of the rites concerned. T.'s description of the sequence of events at sacrifices, well illustrated by his choice of artistic representations, could be a particularly useful section for students of Roman religion and art. T.'s complex understanding of the nature of Roman religion pervades these essays, but they are too short and too compressed. For the non-specialist (or non-Classicist) there is too much left unexplained - while a more detailed exploration of his themes is required for the specialist. The catalogue entries, too, frequently do not give a sufficient explanation of the items illustrated (e.g. why certain gods have particular attributes), and rely too heavily on a sophisticated Latin terminology likely to bewilder the non-Classicist. The format of the Iconography of Religions series demands a study that is over-arching and general in scope, but which at the same time focuses on the minutiae of individual representations. T. has done his best with it. But it remains unclear how one is intended to use this book: as a quick reference for a typical iconographic representation of a particular deity or ritual ? as an introduction to Roman religious iconography 0009-840X/91 $3.00 ?

It would not, it seems to me, satisfy any of the above, although all three types of enquirers would certainly find much of use and fascination within this volume. University of Edinburgh G L E N Y S D A V I E S SARAH ILES JOHNSTON: Hekate Soteira: a Study of Hekate's roles in the Chaldean Oracles and Related Literature. (American Philological Association, American Classical Studies, 21.) Pp. viii+ 192. Atlanta, Georgia: Scholars Press, 1990. $17.95 (Paper, $13.95). The Chaldean Oracles seem fashionable this year, especially in California. Two or three books have been published or are in preparation dealing with them and with Theurgy. The present book is a good and interesting one. The theme is that Hekate, more than any other goddess, was suited by her previous history to symbolize the Middle Platonic Cosmic Soul, which played an important intermediary role in cosmology and anthropology, and was an appropriate figure, by her previous connections in cult and magic, to play a central part in the theurgic rites developed by the authors of the oracles, who were of course influenced by the Middle Platonic koine. The author has collected and presents very well a good variety of well documented material in support of her thesis, and provides much curious information on theurgy. There are good chapters (e.g.) on 'Hekate's Top and the Iynx-Wheel' (VII) and 'Chaldean Daemon-Dogs' (IX): the use of Apotropaic Egyptian Cats in dealing with the latter is not suggested. Altogether a good and illuminating book on the curious borderland between magic, religion and philosophy occupied by the authors of the oracles and the theurgists. There is an adequate bibliography and indices. Ludlow A. H. ARMSTRONG WOLFGANG SPEYER: Fruhes Christentum im antiken Strahlungsfeld. Ausgewahlte Aufsatze. (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament, 50.) Pp. x + 534. Tuibingen: J. C. B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1989. DM 178. Wolfgang Speyer of Salzburg is among the most learned and subtle scholars to work, in the tradition of Usener and F. J. Dolger, on the continuities between the early Christian world and classical culture. This book gathers 33 papers from journals and Festschriften with one previously unprinted piece, and is a rich mine of erudition on a remarkable range of subjects. Some are marginalia on the theme of S.'s books on pseudepigrapha. Almost all are concerned with the survival of ancient notions, practices, and attitudes into the patristic, medieval and modern world - gratia non tollit naturam - and, despite the title, the book has masses of matter for the student of Greek and Roman religion, whether or not interested in what Christians later did with it. A lengthy essay on Apollonius of Tyana from 1977 is a tour de force. S. does not write about theology and ethics. His concern is with the survival of much less sophisticated and more elemental themes: miracle; the sacredness of springs, especially if hot; divine anger for breaches of tabu; the interpretation of lightning strikes, especially if beneficent; divine, heroic, and saintly helpers on the battlefield (a long catalogue which might include the angels of Mons); cleaving enemies of God into two, rooted in the splitting of Tiamat to make heaven and earth; caves with wonderful fires and lights; religious impostors, especially female (such as a lady in thirteenth century Milan who in full vestments performed priestly functions in a secret cave); midday and midnight as sacred hours; ecstatic dancers on hot coals as in Strabo 226 and 537 or among the Anastenarides of modern Thrace. 'The Religion of Augustus' (ANRW 1986) will be well known to readers of CR. S. thinks Ovid (Met. 1) may have known Genesis. A few papers contain hints about S.'s general interpretation of religion. He has affinities with J. G. Frazer's pattern ( no doubt mirroring F.'s personal development) of three stages in magic, religion, and science, but S. merges magic and religion into one.
