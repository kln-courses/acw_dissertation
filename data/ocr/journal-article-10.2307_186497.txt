<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy of Science September, 1967 ON GOING BACKWARD IN TME* JOHN EARMAN Princeton University This paper presents a critical examination of claims advanced by several philoso- phers to the effect that 'time travel' represents a physical possibility and that the interpretation of certain actually observed phenomena in terms of 'time travel' is both legitimate and advantageous. It is argued that (a) no convincing motivation for the introduction of the time travel hypothesis has been presented; (b) no coherent and interesting sense of 'going backward in time' has been supplied which makes 'time travel' compatible with Special Relativity; (c) even the conceptual possibility of 'time travel' is an unsettled and somewhat nebulous question. I The question I wish to treat is whether current physical theory gives us any reason to think that there can or do occur in nature systems which might accurately be described as 'going backward in time' or 'traveling to the past.' In recent years a number of philosophers have proposed affirmative answers to this question. The claim has been made that not only is time travel an interesting conceptual possibility, but that it is also a physical possibility and that certain actually observed phenomena and certain accepted theories lend support to the hypothesis that cases of tilmle travel can and do occur. For example, Hilary Putnam [15] describes a series of events in the life of one Oscar Smith and reports that he, Putnam, "has no doubt whatever" that "any reasonable scientist" would agree that these events are best described as "Oscar Smith lives backward in time from t2 to t1" ([15], p. 667). Although Put- nam does not explicitly say so, he seems to feel that the scientist's willingness to commit himself to this interpretation of the imagined macro-process follows from his experience with actually observed micro-processes, i.e., particle-anti-particle anni- hilation and creation processes. (Putnam drops this phrase twice [15], pp. 665- 666). In their paper, "Measuring Measuring Rods," Graves and Roper [11] explicitly claim that the interpretation of creation and annihilation processes as cases of 'time travel' or cases of objects 'going backward in time' is not only legitimate but has certain advantages. Reichenbach [16] refers to Feynman's investigations as show- * Received February, 1967. 211</page><page sequence="2">212 JOHN EARMAN ing that a positron can be regarded as an electron 'moving backward in time' and, hence, that we may have to change several of our preconceptions about time order and the identity of particles.' I will argue that not only have these philosophers failed to provide any convinc- ing motivation for introducing the time travel hypothesis, but they have also failed to provide any coherent and interesting sense of 'going backward in time' which is at the same time compatible with accepted theory. In the last section I will touch upon the question of the conceptual possibility of time travel. I begin by examining some of the arguments offered by Graves and Roper as motivation for the time travel hypothesis. II A*/ x FIGUR IL Figure 1 is supposed to represent the following process: at B an electron-positron pair is created, the world line of the former particle being given by y and the world line of the latter by f3; at A the positron annihilates with an electron whose world line is represented by a. Graves and Roper claim that there is another legiti- mate interpretation of this process: the diagram shows the world line of a single object, rather than three; in the P cycle, the world line is 'bent backward in time' and hence represents an electron 'traveling backward in time.' Certain advantages are also claimed for this latter interpretation. First, the mysterious creation and annihilation processes are "eliminated and replaced by something relatively familiar and well-understood."2 Leaving aside the question how 'going backward in time' is at all familiar or understood, let us imagine a rather unsophisticated theoretical framework-to use Graves and Roper's terminology-in which macroscopic descrip- tions of objects can be given but which reflects no knowledge of the molecular and atomic constitution of matter and no knowledge of the fact that the forms of matter 1 For similar claims see [8] and [14]. 2 [11], p. 46. Also see [16], section 30.</page><page sequence="3">ON GOING BACKWARDS IN TIME 213 are not inviolable, e.g., that solids can turn into vapors. Consider another diagram which has the form of Figure 1 and which represents the following process: at B two snow balls are created by near instantaneous freezing of water vapor; one of the balls then collides at A with a third snow ball and they 'annihilate,' cease to be as macroscopic objects. To an observer using the hypothetical framework under con- sideration, such a process would certainly seem anomalous and mysterious, and per- haps he would be tempted to try to make sense out of his observations by postulat- ing that there were not really three snow balls but only one, that that the world line of the snow ball is bent backward in time at A, and that in the P cycle it travels backward in time., But when our observer learns of the molecular makeup of matter and the ways in which one form of matter can change into another, there is little motivation for his resorting to the notion of time travel, for now there is nothing anomalous or mysterious since the new theoretical framework predicts and explains such occurrences. The original annihilation-creation process would certainly seem mysterious to us if our theoretical framework did not contain the special theory of relativity (here- after SR) or quantum field theory, but it contains both. The particles which annihi- late at A do not go into nothingness but into the energy cf the field-strictly speak- ing, the diagram should show the world lines of photons intersecting with points A and B. The equivalence of mass and energy implied by SR prepares us for such a thing, and the quantum field theory specifically predicts such processes. Thus I fail to see that within our present theoretical framework there is anything mysterious represented by Figure 1 which needs to be eliminated. To this it might be replied that although field theory does yield probabilistic predictions about creation and annihilation processes, it does not really explain them. Now I am sympathetic to the general thesis that explanation cannot be equated with subsumption under laws of nature, whether the subsumption be deductive or probabilistic, but this general point does not constitute an argument in favor of Graves and Roper's position; the quantum theory has been offered by many scientists as an explanatory theory so that it seems up to Graves and Roper to say exactly why and in what sense creation and annihilation processes remain unexplained, mysterious, or anomalous. More- over, the interpretation proposed by Graves and Roper carries with it its own puz- zles and mysteries, e.g., one and the same entity can be at different places at the same time.3 A second advantage listed by Graves and Roper is that their interpretation ac- counts for the identity of electron and positron (i.e., that they differ only in the sign of their electric charge) which is otherwise "so puzzling" ([11], p. 46). How are we to interpret the claim that electrons and positrons differ only in the sign of their electric charge since, for example, electrons and positrons enter into interactions with other particles in very different ways? Well, the difference in their interactions might be completely due to the difference in the sign of their charges in the sense that the laws governing the interactiorns of positrons (electrons) can be obtained from the laws gsverning the interactions of electrons (positrons) by making what- 'According to Graves and Roper, the same particle is at different places at the same objective time but different proper times. However, for reasons to be explained in section IV, I do not think that this distinction helps to remove the paradoxical air of the consequence considered above.</page><page sequence="4">214 JOHN EARMAN ever changes are appropriate to the interchange of positive and negative charge. This suggestion might be made precise by saying that the interactions in which electrons and positrons engage are invariant under charge conjugation. But experi- ments performed in the 1950's showed that this is not so [17]. Of course, the time travel hypothesis may not be committed to the consequence that electrons and posi- trons have identical properties except for the signs of their charges, but the above point does help to weaken the plausibility of identifying the electron of the a cycle with the positron of the a cycle as Graves and Roper must do. Next, how does the notion that positrons are electrons going backward in time help to explain the existent similarities and differences between these particles? Graves and Roper are not ex- plicit on this point. One approach might be to postulate that electric charge is odd under time reversal; this is not currently believed to be the case ([13], sections 15, 17, 19). In addition, one would have to postulate that mass does not change under time reversal; some speculation suggests that this may not be the case ([13], sec- tion 19). A third advantage claimed by Graves and Roper for their account is that it cuts down on the number of entities needed: a positron is not a new kind of particle, it is just an electron going backward in time ([11], p. 46). How might the notion of going backward in time allow us to achieve such a reduction? Scientists sometimes say that if IFe&gt; represents the state of an electron, then the time reversed state IFe&gt;T= TlJ Fe&gt; (where T is the time reversal operator) represent an 'electron go- ing backward in time.'4 So one might seek to identify the state IFp&gt; of a positron with the reversed state TI Yfe&gt; of an electron. However, in the currently accepted theory, Ip&gt; is identified not with Tlf e&gt; but rather with CPI e&gt; (where C is the charge conjugation operator and P is the parity or coordinate inversion operator. ([13] section 15, 17 and 19). It is true that under very general assumptions CPT is always a valid symmetry so that CP is a symmetry if and only if T is; but this does not imply that CP T. Moreover, let us even suppose that there is a particle whose state is identified with lyre&gt;T; for example, there was some speculation to the effect that we might identify the state of the muon 'tu&gt; Nvith lyJe &gt;T. It turns out, how- ever, that the mass of the muon and electron are not equal so that mass transforms in a very unexpected way under time reversal. ([13], sections 17 and 19). Thus this identification, far from eliminating mysteries, actually introduces them. Sec- ondly, the fact that the state vectors of the muon and positron can be obtained from the state vector of the electron in a systematic way (i.e., by applying the operators T or CP) does not cut down on the number of specific entities, it does not lead us to say that there is only one particle any more than the fact that the classical state description of my left hand can be obtained in a systematic way from that of my right hand leads me to say that I only have one hand. Graves and Roper argue that if we reject the principle that objects in different places at the same time must be distinct, "one can simply use the principle of the identity of indiscernables" since by hypothesis the 'three objects' in the diagram are otherwise alike. ([11] pp. 44- 45). But the actual particles engaging in creation and creation processes (e.g. electrons and positrons) are not otherwise alike since they differ in electric charge and the way they enter into weak interactions. More importantly, if we reject the principle that objects at different places at the same time are distinct, then by For example, see [2], p. 72.</page><page sequence="5">ON GOING BACKWARDS IN TIME 215 Graves and Roper's argument, we can say that there is only one electron, one pro- ton, one neutron, etc. in the universe since the 'billions of electrons,' the 'billions of protons,' etc. are 'otherwise alike.' This consequence might not be taken as a draw- back but as an advantage because of the resultant ontological simplicity. However, it is not at all clear to me in what sense an ontology which consists of a single object which manifests itself at many places at the same time is simpler than an ontology with many similar objects. Moreover, what is important is the overall simplicity of the entire theoretical framework, and since any simplicity which is achieved by applying Graves and Roper's bastardized version of the principle of the identity of indiscernables must be paid for by far-reaching changing in how we talk about objects, it is dubious that an overall simplicity will be achieved. Nor is it clear that the assumed relations between the state vectors of the electron, positron, and muon even cuts down on the total number of kinds of entities rather than giving us a systematic way of linking the behavior of different kinds of entities. My left hand is the mirror image of my right hand, and this fact allows me to relate in a systematic way how my left hand would behave if it were, say, tossed into the air in a certain manner to the way my right hand would behave if it were tossed into the air in a similar manner, but it does not follow that I have only one kind of hand. Compare 'A left hand is a right hand seen through a mirror' to 'A fugitive is a man on the run'. 'Fugitive' is a subcategory of 'man': 'x is a fugitive' 'x is a man and x is on the run', and the criteria for distinguishing a member of the category 'man' apply also to 'fugitive.' But 'left hand' is not a subcategory of 'right hand': 'x is a left hand' #7 'x is a right hand and x is seen through a mirror,' nor do the criteria for distinguishing a member of the category 'right hand' apply to 'left hand.' In brief, the discovery by a scientist of the relationships of the type discussed above electrons, positrons, and muons does not bring about a reduction in the number of entities any more than does the discovery by a primitive man of the analogous rela- tionship between right and left hands. Finally, even if IY'p&gt; is identified with Ife&gt;T, in what sense are we justified in saying that a positron is an electron run- ning backward in time? This question will be taken up in the next section. It must be emphasized that nothing I have said so far damages the Graves-Roper construction as an interesting physical possibility, but the points raised above do seem to undercut the motivation for introducing such a construction as an explana- tory hypothesis, and they raise questions as to the logic of such an explanation and the meaning of 'going backward in time.' III Putnam describes a system and says that: If we take a moving picture of this system during its entire period of existence, we will fnd that if the movie is played backwards then the events are normal. In short, this is a system running backward in time-entropy in the system is decreasing in- stead of increasing, cigarette butts are growing into whole cigarettes, . . . and so forth. [15] p. 666) The first thing one wants to say is that it is not at all clear that systems 'go forward in time'-they just develop in time-so it is not at all clear that they can go 'back- ward in time.' What Putnam's example might be taken as suggesting then is that</page><page sequence="6">216 JOHN EARMAN the phrase 'going backward in time' is used to contrast the way a system S' develops in time with the way another system S develops. More specifically, the suggestion might be that if a system S evolves from a state si to a state sf while S' evolves from a state sf'T to a state S11T, where ST denotes the time reverse of the state s and s' is the state obtained from s by changing, say, the origin of the space and time coordi- nates in a specified manner, and the si -&gt; sf sequence is 'normal' while the Sf'T &gt; SiT iS 'abnormal,' then relative to S, S' is going backward in time. Now 'normal' might be meant to contrast with 'abnormal' in the sense of going against de facto regularities. For example, one often sees cream mix with coffee but one never sees cream spontaneously unmix from coffee; the latter process does not violate any laws of nature-indeed, all the fundamental laws which govern such a process are believed to be completely time symmetric; but it is 'abnormal' in our present sense because the probability of the realization of the initial conditions necessary for such a process is very low. But suppose one day the improbable did happen and Putnam observed the temporal inverse of cream mixing with coffee; then he might say 'If we took a movie of this system and then played it backwards, the events are all normal. In short, this is a system running backward in time- cream is spontaneously unmixing from the coffee'. A more felicitious thing to say might have been 'The improbable happened; cream unmixed from my coffee today.' If Putnam insists on using the 'forward' and 'backward in time' terminology, I must insist I see no sense in which one system is not going forward or backward in time just as much as the other. Of course, there is no objection to using the forward- backward terminology as a colorful way of expressing the fact that the sequences of states of the two systems are related to each other as the s and s'T sequences above, but colorful language aside, I see nothing in the fact that our coffee with cream 'went backward in time' to selve as a basis for the claims about 'time travel' that Putnam, Graves, and Roper make, at least if 'time travel' is to mean anything different from 'travel through space over a period of time'. On the other hand, 'normal' might be meant to contrast with 'abnormal' in the sense of contradicting a law of nature; that is, the s sequence of states would repre- sent a nomologically possible sequence while the S'T sequence would be nomologi- cally impossible. Under these circumstances, the description of S as 'going forward in time' is not objectionable for now time has an 'arrow'-the sequences of states which occur in nature display a kind of directedness. But this situation is of no help to Putnam, for the system S' is not going backward in time since it isn't going anywhere in time: it is nomologically impossible for such a system to exist. Putnam's example sounds more convincing because he throws in something about entropy decreasing, but even when this element is added the same conclusions hold. From the point of view of statistical mechanics, entropy may decrease; in fact, sta- tistical mechanics leads us to expect that in an isolated system the number of de- creases in the entropy will be approximately equal to the number increases, in the long run (see [23], part 1). One never sees a large decrease in the entropy of a macroscopic system the size of a cup of coffee since the long run must be very long, i.e., it is highly improbable that over time intervals on the order of a man's lifetime that a large decrease will be seen (the cream will unmix from the coffee). On the other hand, if we restrict ourselves to the (false) theory of thermodynamics, then the entropy of a closed system cannot decrease with time. One might try to maneu- ver around this difficulty by taking the direction of increase of entropy as defining</page><page sequence="7">ON GOING BACKWARDS IN TIME 217 the positive direction of time for a system, thus allowing the conclusion that systems with different directions of entropy increase have different time directions. But as Griinbaum [12] points out, this definition was promoted by what people took to be an empirical fact; namely, that there is a concordance in the behavior of all closed systems. Once the falsity of this assumption becomes apparent, and once statistical mechanics replaces thermodynamics, what reason is there for seizing on entropy rather than some other property of a system as defining the time direction for that system? Consider a mechanically reversible gas and suppose the evolution from state si to sf is accompanied by a monotonic increase in entropy; then since the usual expressions for entropy in statistical mechanics are invariant under the sub- stitution of -v for v, the evolution of the gas from state SfT to S,T will be accom- panied by a monotonic decrease in entropy. Our question then boils down to the question, how does reversing the velocities of the gas molecules justify saying the gas is going backward in time? So far we have found no such justification. If Gardner's query, 'Can time go backward?' [8] is to be taken literally, I think the answer is quite simply no, for time does not 'go,' or 'unroll,' or 'flow.' All at- tempts to give a literal-minded interpretation to the notion of the flow of time have met with failure. (See [12] and [19] chapt. 7). On the other hand, if Gardner's query is jusy a roundabout way of asking, 'Can physical systems develop the oppo- site way in time?' then the answer is yes, if the law goveming such processes are reversible. But as argued above, this fact is not relevant to time travel, for the word 'opposite' characterizes the way the system develops in time (i.e., the time develop- ment of the system) and not the way or direction in time in which the system de- velops (i.e., 'forward' or 'backward in time' as 'opposite' in 'Can particles go the opposite direction in space?' characterizes the way or direction in space the particles go-North vs. South). It should also be pointed out that reversibility does not mean that a 'time ma- chine' in even the weak sense of Putnam is possible. In fact, it is quite easily shown that if the laws governing electrons and positrons are reversible, then no physical mechanism will induce a transition from a state IT&gt; to its reverse state y&gt;&gt;T.5 It might be thought that the quantum theory could help Putnam and Gardner. For example, their talk of forward and backward in time might make sense if there were states 1F&gt; such that IT3&gt; and its reverse fI&gt;T had a different 'time sense" or 'timeness' just as there are states 10&gt; such that j0&gt; and its image 1m under reflection through a plane have a different 'handedness.' More fully, It&gt; and !V&gt;T would be eigenstates of a 'timeness' operator just as 1jc&gt; and I0&gt;m are ei- genstates of a chirality or handedness operator, and the time reversal operator T would carry states with one time sense into states with the opposite sense just as the 5 The proof proceeds by showing that the transition probability between 1PF&gt; and I!V&gt;T is identically zero. Let u be the time development operator; the condition of reversibility is Tu = tuT where 't' denotes the hermitian conjugate. The transition amplitude from [T&gt;&gt;T to !V&gt; is then &lt;YIIuI!V&gt;T = &lt;Y-'ujTYf&gt; &lt;Tu TWIT'&gt; = &lt;uIT2YJT!F&gt; (-1)&lt;uIf TY!&gt; (-1) &lt;Y'uTY'&gt; 0 The second equality follows from the antiunitarity of r, the third from the reversibility con- dition, and the fourth from C2 =-1. See [13] and [17]</page><page sequence="8">218 JOHN EARMAN reflection operator m carries states with one handedness into states with the oppo- site handedness. If this suggestion were a good one, one would expect that there would be states with a definite 'time parity,' i.e., eigenstates of T just as there are states with a definite 'space parity,' i.e., eigenstates of m. However, the antilinear nature of T prevents this possibility ([17], chapt. 4). For electrons and positrons this can be seen in a very simple way. Suppose that TIT&gt; = clf&gt; (c a con- stant). Applying T to both sides and using its antilinear character, we have T21YJ'&gt; = c*TFIYI&gt;= -cj2jf ('c*' denotes the complex conjugate of c). But since for electrons and positrons T2 -1, either If !&gt; is the null vector or else we have the contradiction -1 = jcj2. (But perhaps all this shows is that nothing can sit on the banks of the river of time.) In the second place, there are many hermitian operators which have two eigenvalues, say ? 1, and which are odd under time rever- sal so that T carries states with eigenvalues + 1 into states with eigenvalues -1 and vice versa, but there is little temptation to single out any of these operators as a timeness operator or to say that its cigenstates have a forward or backward timeness, for just as in the classical case, there seems to be nothing to be captured by this device. This does not rule out the possibility that future developments will necessi- tate the modification of current theory by the introduction of an additional internal degree of freedom which indicates a 'time sense'; in fact, such a proposal has been made by Stannard [201, but exactly what this proposal amounts to, whether it will come to be adopted, and what relevance it may have for our problem must await further experimental and theoretical development for elucidation. Putnam's claims about the possibility of time travel at first seem exciting since they make one think of the H. G. Wells story of a machine which enables a man to go backward in time, to visit past ages, and to wander "beside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age." ([241, p. 117) But when we strip away the colorful 'for- ward' and 'backward in time' terminology used by Putnam to describe the processes considered above and when we see that there is not much of an argument for saving that there is only one particle or one Oscar Smith instead of saying there are three particles or three Oscar Smiths, there is little temptation to say that we have been presented with a process which goes backward in time in something like the H. G. Wells sense. In the next section I will examine an attempt by Graves and Roper to supply an interesting sense of going backward in time which may legitimately be attached to physically possible cases. IV World lines bending backward in time would provide a basis for an interesting, sense of time travel. However, world lines cannot literally bend backward on them- selves in the manner of Figure 2(a), at least if SR includes a Causality Postulate to the effect that the velocity of light is the maximal velocity of a causal signal and if the motion of a particle from point A to point B constitutes a signal from A to B. Despite this difficulty, Graves and Roper think that there is a sense in which world lines can bend backward in time. "To go backward in time means," according to Graves and Roper, "to go in reverse order to objective time" ([11], p. 42). The notion of objective time is introduced by remarks that It is a remarkable, if contingent fact about our world, however, that the time-coordi- nates of all systems seem to be topologically so relatable to one another that they all</page><page sequence="9">ON GOING BACKWARDS IN TIME 219 t, (a.) (b) FIGURE 2 point in the same direction . .. Thus the proper time of all observers can be 'fitted together' in such a way that there is a general consensus about the order of a se- quence of events; we call this order 'objective time.' ([11], p. 42) Thus in Figure 2(b), the t-axis would represent objective time and the arrows on the a and P cycles indicate increasing proper time. Since in the P cycle the world line bends backward and points in a direction opposite to that of the t-coordinate of objective time, we shall say that the object is traveling backward in time during that cycle. ([11] p. 42) Several comments are in order. First, it is misleading to say that it is a contingent fact that the proper times of all observers fit together, for it is a theorem of SR (if the Causality Postulate is included) that if events E and E' are connectable by a signal and E' is later than E for observer 0, then E' is later than E for every other observer O'. As a consequence, it is misleading to draw the arrow of the P cycle in a sense opposite to that of the a cycle, for the arrow cannot literally represent increasing proper time-otherwise an observer in the rest frame of the particle of the [ cycle would disagree with other observers over the time order of events connectible by a causal signal (e.g., two events on the P part of the world line) contradicting SR. One might try to escape this difficulty by maintaining with Terletskii [22] that even in the face of the Causality Postulate one can have particles with velocities exceeding the velocity of light, thus allowing for the possibility of disagreement about time order; for, it mnight be argued, the motion of such particles constitutes a signal only if their emission from a source can be systematically repeated. Alterna-</page><page sequence="10">220 JOHN EARMAN tively, one could drop altogether the Causality Postulate, as Bilaniuk, et al. [1] seem to do, and argue that Lorentz invariance is compatible with the denial of this postu- late. Both of these alternatives face serious difficulties. The existence of particles with v &gt; c in conjunction with the Lorentz transformation implies that either such particles have negative energies or else they have imaginary rest masses. More seri- ously, rest length and proper time bcome imaginary. Bilaniuk, et. al. attempt to handle this difficulty by arguing that there is no contradiction since the rest length and proper time are not accessible to measurement by an observer since by defi- nition an observer must have v &lt; c. It seems to me that this reply succeeds only by endowing 'observer' with an anthropomorphic sense which it does not normally have in SR. Normally, one can dispense with talk of observers in favor of talk of reference frames, readings on clocks, etc.; but if this is correct, then what Bilaniuk, et al. are saying is that these latter concepts do not make sense for particles with v &gt; c, and this seems just another way of repeating the original difficulty. In any case, it is difficult to see how the possibility of particles with super-luminary veloci- ties would be of help to Graves and Roper since the notion of proper time for such particles does not seem coherent. What about the Feynman theory of electrons which Graves and Roper cite? It is true that Feynman uses the slogan, 'Positrons are electrons running backward in time', but it is dangerous to draw philosophical conclusions from slogans. Essen- tially what Feynman [6] shows is that if one wants to work within the framework of a relativistic particle theory (Dirac's electron theory), and if one adopts the propagator approach, and if one does not want to allow negative energy solutions 'propagating forward in time,' then in contrast to the non-relativistic case, one must use the advanced propagator and the negative energy solutions must be associated with it. As a result, the probability amplitude for, say, producig a positron at point x and propagating it to x' where it has momentum p and spin s is equal to the ampli- tude for a negative energy electron with momentum -p and spin -s to propagate from x' back to x where it is destroyed [2]. It should not be necessary to point out that the sense Feynman assigns to 'Positrons are electrons running backward in time,' (i.e., that the matrix element for electron scattering is frfinal* M!Finitial dV while that for a positron is f(Sinitial* M ()final dV where 0 is a negative energy solution ([17], chapt. 5)) should not be confused with the sense which Graves and Roper assign to the same statement, nor should it be necessary to point out that Feynman's theory does not justify the identification of particular electrons with par- ticular positrons in such a way as to make time travel possible. Moreover, there seems to be little motivation or justification for attributing to Feynman's calculation rules the ontological interpretation which Graves and Roper need. The quantum field theory implies a rigorous justification for Feynman's rules without implying anything about positrons being electrons running backward in time. These rules are seen to be a consequence of a general relationship between processes like P + Q &gt; R + S and P + R - Q + S (where the bar denotes the anti- particle) ([2] and [3]). And in view of the above discussion, it is hard to see what significance could legitimately be attached to these rules which would benefit Graves and Roper.</page><page sequence="11">ON GOING BACKWARDS IN TIME 221 V General relativity seems to offer more hope than SR to the proponent of time travel; indeed, Godel [9] has reported solutions to the field equations of GR which, according to Godel, allow one to "travel into any region of the past, present, and future, and back again, exactly as it is possible in other worlds to travel to distant parts of space." ([10], p. 560). G6del's claims have recently been challenged by Chandrasekhar [4], but it seems to me that Chandrasekhar's criticism rests on a mis- understanding: Chandrasekhar bases his criticism on the properties of geodesics in a Godelian universe while Godel himself states that the world lines which allow time travel are not geodesics; crudely, one would need a rocket ship to be a time traveler in Godel's universe. However, it is not at all clear what conclusions about time travel can be drawn. Godel's universe allows closed time-like lines (lines such that if one always proceeds in a positive, time-like direction, one eventually returns to the same space-time point). This situation might lead one to conclude with Einstein ([5], pp. 687-8) that the distinction between before and after, in the sense in which these cocepts were originally understood, does not make sense over long intervals in a Godelian universe, and therefore, one might be tempted to conclude that 'time travel' is pos- sible in a Godelian universe only because 'time' no longer means what it was origi- nally taken to mean. Such a tack immediately involves one in a morass of problems about meaning and change of meaning, but even if one is skeptical about talk of meaning, one must face up to the question as to what extent the concepts of time, casuality, and identity which appear in a coherent account of time travel would resemble our present concepts. The preceding discussion seems to indicate that there would have to be several non-trivial changes in these concepts, but this ques- tion would have to be discussed in detail.6' 7 REFERENCES [1] Bilaniuk, 0.
