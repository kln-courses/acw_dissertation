<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews and Reflections: Teaching and Learning of Nonfiction JUDITH SCHEU, JOYCE AHUNA-KA'A'AI, MADELLINE OSHIRO, AND NANI PAI In keeping with the theme of this issue - Nonfic- tion, Language Learning, and Language Teach- ing - we focus on professional books that explore the use of expository texts and instructional ma- terials that present information for elementary- and middle-school-age children. First, however, we discuss a book that provides a whole language perspective on language learning and teaching. The viewpoint of this book has helped to shape and guide our thinking about the other materials which we recommend. Professional Resources Understanding Whole Language: From Principles to Practice. Constance Weaver. Portsmouth , NH : Heinemann , 1990 . 309 pp. Paper. An on- going focus of our team of educators has been to examine the tenets of whole language and to fos- ter classroom practices that support our evolving philosophy about literacy development. This pro- fessional book speaks directly to our many ques- tions about whole language and serves as a guide as we struggle with making changes in our class- rooms. Weaver's aim is to provide a broad audience of educators and parents with information about whole language: (1) philosophy, (2) research basis, (3) supportive practices, and (4) ideas for implementation. She fulfills these goals very clearly and sensibly in 11 chapters. In chapters 1-4 Weaver presents the philosophy of whole lan- guage. She contrasts it with a traditional, trans- mission model of teaching and learning in which 41 we try to teach active thinking and reading in a passive way that inhibits the development of those very abilities." Whole language offers a transactional process in which learners are ac- tively involved with significant concepts. "What we teach is what we get," Weaver says. Chapters 5 and 6 contrast research studies that support part-to-whole instructional approaches with whole-to-part approaches. Weaver argues that "systematic phonics" is a part-to-whole ap- proach, and "intrinsic phonics" is a whole-to- part approach. "Today's whole language ap- proach is not a no-phonics approach" but rather teaches phonics as "intrinsic to meaningful read- ing." We have found these chapters to be ex- tremely helpful in clarifying and articulating our views about phonics instruction. In addition to our concerns about phonics, we have also struggled with the issue of direct in- struction within a whole language classroom. Chapters 7-10 describe classroom practices that support a whole language philosophy. Developing phonics knowledge, comprehension, and thinking are discussed, and the teacher's role is clearly de- fined. It is evident that direct teaching occurs, but in ways significantly different from those in Language Arts, Vol. 68, October 1991 502</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND REFLECTIONS traditional classrooms. Examples depict direct in- struction through (1) "demonstrations in which the teacher is personally involved and in which the students are invited to engage"; (2) "seizing the 'teachable moment' "; (3) more or less inci- dental instruction "within the context of authen- tic literacy events in which students are engaged"; and (4) "mini-lessons" which will ben- efit at least some children and add to the class pool of knowledge. Weaver addresses the issues of assessment and accountability by discussing the weaknesses of standardized testing and offer- ing alternative assessment methods based upon class activities and projects. Accountability takes on new meaning within this alternative view. Weaver's book is certainly sensible and con- vincing. As she explains whole language, it is "nothing more - nor less - than good education." So how can such a philosophy be implemented? Chapter 11 provides some answers. Just as whole language teachers are guided by the successes of their students, Weaver takes guidance from the successes of administrators and other change agents. As we reflect upon the voices of the ex- perts that she presents, we, too, find guidance and inspiration. Investigate Nonfiction. Donald H. Graves. Ports- mouthy NH: Heinemann , 1989. 128 pp. Paper. Build a Literate Classroom. Donald H. Graves. Portsmouth y NH : Heinemann , 1991. 208 pp. Paper. Discover Your Own Literacy. Donald H. Graves. Portsmouth , NH: Heinemann, 1989. 148 pp. Paper. Donald Graves also embraces the whole language philosophy in The Reading/Writ- ing Teacher's Companion. We reviewed three books from this series that offer approaches for building literacy in the classroom as well as for developing one's own personal literacy. To focus on the theme of this issue, we first explored an early book in this series, Investigate Nonfiction. It is a useful handbook for teachers interested in incorporating content area learning in their classrooms. Graves provides some very sensible and meaningful ways of introducing non- fiction writing to students. He contends that young children show early evidence of nonfiction writing, beginning with discourse and continuing to actual writing and recording of events and ob- servations of their world. From these early but meaningful experiences, more formal types of writing can be introduced and fine-tuned. As a third-grade teacher, Joyce found the chapters "The Lively Art of the Interview" and "Formal Reportings" to be especially helpful. Graves suggests "actions" which are personal growth experiments for his readers to explore. These include mini-lessons on note taking, for- mulating questions, interviewing techniques, and organizing information. He recommends that stu- dents be given many opportunities to expand upon what they already know. There is a clear sense of student ownership throughout this process. It seems that students make the transition to content area reading and writing easily when they have a strong foundation in whole language. It is in this environment that they acquire confidence as readers and writers. Our enthusiasm for this book led us to Graves' most recent books in the series. Build a Literate Classroom offers a wealth of ideas on how to form an environment supportive of a whole lan- guage philosophy. Graves asks readers to look deeply at their own ideas about learning because these definitions will influence their classrooms' structure and curriculum. He also suggests prac- tical ideas on the topics of writing conferences, mini-lessons, teacher modeling, and organizing a literate classroom. In Discover Your Own Literacy , Graves chal- lenges teachers to explore their own literacy and learning. Suggestions such as reading with stu- dents, writing with students, and actively engag- ing in personal reading and writing will all help to 503</page><page sequence="3">LANGUAGE ARTS broaden teachers' understanding of literacy - their own as well as their students'. Joyce was in- spired to implement many of the 4 'actions" sug- gested in these three books. She appreciated Graves' concise, sensible approach and personal manner. His examples, taken from his own per- sonal experiences, provide helpful models for his readers. A common thread flows throughout these three books: In order to implement a successful whole literacy classroom, teachers must define their own ideas about students' learning, and they must continue to develop their own literacy. Guided by such models, their students will flour- ish as readers and writers of a wide variety of text forms. Specific chapters from two recently published books have provided us with some very useful, classroom-tested ideas for supporting students' understanding of informational text. The ideas are consistent with the philosophies of both Weaver and Graves. "Bridging the Gap." Patricia J. Collins. "Begin- ning Researchers." Donna Maxim . In Coming to Know: Writing to Learn in the Intermediate Grades. Nancie Atwell, Ed. Portsmouth , NH : Heinemann , 1990 , pp 3-31. Paper. These two chapters explore ways to teach reading and writ- ing in the content areas. Nani says she was so ex- cited after reading "Beginning Researchers" that she wanted to try some of Maxim's ideas in her own third-grade classroom. She became aware of the need to focus more on the process rather than the product. "Bridging the Gap," by Patricia J. Collins, echoes this same sentiment. Collins says that "the writing process my students would use was as important as the end product." In her chapter, Donna Maxim shares how she teaches her third graders to become researchers. She sponsors a range of activities designed to ex- pose her students "to a variety of research princi- ples and procedures and to give them practice in note taking, observing, interviewing, and ques- tioning." Children are encouraged to share their research information with others in the class throughout the process. To complete the process, they also share a variety of simple projects in- cluding dioramas, published books, and games. Maxim says, "I demonstrate, students practice, and we share our discoveries as we investigate new topics across the curriculum." Collins, a sixth-grade teacher, shares her inter- est in making connections between the writing workshop and content areas. She categorizes her classroom activities in four areas. (1) Planning occurs when children are given adequate time to explore topics of personal interest. Collins pro- vides relevant, direct instruction as children en- gage in planning. During (2) Class time , students gather information and then write about what they have learned. In (3) Teacher response , Col- lins is a participator and fellow worker providing incidental instruction for her students. The last category, (4) Student responsibility, focuses on ownership. Students are responsible for carrying out their projects and deciding how to write their reports. Collins found that by integrating content instruction into the writers' workshop, a commu- nity of learners was formed that benefited both students and teacher. Teaching Reading Comprehension: Meaning Makers at Work. Trevor H. Cairney. Phila- delphia, PA: Open University Press, 1990. 129 pp. Paper. Chapter 7 focuses upon the com- prehension of factual texts. Cairney, like Weaver, clearly defines the teacher's role as active and re- sponsive. He suggests that teachers demonstrate their own involvement in specific strategies by providing a model for their students. He explains the rationale for each strategy described and sug- gests variations of the strategies. The sense of a learning community is apparent as Cairney describes the integration of factual reading and writing in chapter 9. In this chapter he suggests a sequence of lessons for research re- port writing that has been used with 1 1 -year-olds and can be varied for other ages. Throughout the process the teacher shares his own work as a model for the whole class and provides incidental 504 ft- raCÉMtr</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS AND REFLECTIONS instruction as needed. As students work through the research process following their own personal interests, they, too, share with one another and provide assistance as they are able. Like Cairney, we also have found that many students have problems reading to find informa- tion, summarizing factual texts, and writing re- ports. We are glad that Cairney reflected upon his own classroom practices in order to offer some meaningful strategies to his students . . . and to ours. Having some new ideas for content area in- struction, we turned our thinking toward high- quality materials for our student researchers. We found two recently published resources which were helpful in guiding our selections. Reference Materials Literature for the Young Child. Eileen Burke. Boston, MA: Allyn and Bacon, 1990. 316 pp. Paper. The fact that literature enriches our lives cannot be disputed. As educators, we are contin- uously looking for good books to share with our students as well as with each other. Burke has filled these needs by giving us an excellent re- source book on literature for children, primarily ages 3-8. She has divided her book into 1 1 chapters and 3 appendices. Each chapter is then organized into five parts: text, summary, discussion activities, endnotes, and professional bibliography. The ap- pendices include a guide for storytelling, a com- plete Caldecott Book Award list, and a list of possible sources for teachers and librarians to use in conferences with parents on the benefits of reading. Although each chapter offers many insights concerning appropriate kinds of literature for spe- cific purposes or genres, we will focus on Chap- ter 10, "The Facts of Literature." In this chapter Burke discusses nine criteria for evaluating infor- mation books. They are: "(1) accuracy in both narrative and graphic matter, (2) purposeful inte- gration of narration and illustration, (3) clear focus, (4) relevance to the young child's experi- ence and background, (5) clear syntax, (6) terms explained visually and verbally, (7) sound and logical organization, (8) no anthropomorphism, and (9) appropriate print size and uncluttered pages." She quotes from an article by Jo Carr, "(A) good nonfiction book as it marshals facts should create a challenge. It should encourage a child to think - to relate one fact to another and test a fa- miliar idea against a new idea until at last he or she is able to weave a pattern of increased under- standing. What begins as idle curiosity should end as independent thinking." Other ideas also sparked our interest. Some educators contend that interest in scientific knowledge would be heightened if it were pre- sented in narrative rather than expository form. Still others suggest that the story structure of nar- ratives (story grammar) might serve as a model for educational materials dealing with information of all kinds. Educators working with young children will appreciate the listing of excellent information book titles classified according to topic. They will also appreciate the suggestions for using the books in their classrooms. Adventuring with Books: A Booklist for Pre- K-Grade 6. Mary Jett-Simpson, Ed. Urbana, IL: NCTE, 1989. 548 pp. Paper. We have found this volume an excellent resource in our search for high-quality informational books for our students. It is one of four different booklists published reg- ularly by NCTE. This edition contains an anno- tated list of books recommended by teachers and librarians and selected for their artistic quality, appeal to children, and accuracy of information. The titles cover a wide range of topics. For this review we focused particularly on the recommen- dations for information books. Teachers will find this a helpful source for de- signing units of instruction. "The annotations, or- ganization of contents, additional booklists, and subject index are designed to assist teachers in developing units around topics, subjects, themes, 505 LITERSIURE k)k I I IL YONG CHILD WWW '' KUKkt</page><page sequence="5">LANGUAGE ARTS authors, illustrators, and genres, and to link with content study to extend, enrich, and humanize the information' ' (p. xix). The annotations are es- pecially helpful for practitioners because curricu- lum connections are made when the book contains a strong feature for making such ties. We were extremely impressed with the compre- hensive nonfiction section encompassing histor- ical fiction, biography, social studies, science, mathematics, fine arts, crafts and hobbies, sports and games, and holidays. There is a good balance between primary and intermediate titles in each section. Teachers will also find this reference helpful for locating other information about children's books. It includes a directory of publishers and a list of books that have received awards. There is also a chapter on professional books and another on teaching with literature. Classroom Materials Let's Visit (Series). Mahwah , NJ : Troll Associ- ates , 1990. Nani found this delightful series to be a "hit" with her third-grade students. They loved the books and were able to extract lots of good information. In reviewing Let's Visit a Bicycle Factory , Curtis commented, "I think it's excel- lent because it shows how you can make your own bike, including all the steps." Another stu- dent, Eric, had this to say about Leť s Visit a Super Zoo: "I'd give it a k10' because it tells you how and why animals became endangered." After reading Literature for the Young Child , Nani compared the books in this series to Burke's nine criteria for information books. All criteria were met, and Nani was especially im- pressed with the integration of the clearly-written texts and illustrations. This integration is shown in an example from Let's Visit a Super Zoo : "Whenever a rare animal baby is born, it's a step toward saving a species from extinction. So it's important for these zoo animals to have lots of babies. There are very few douc langur monkeys and Mhorr gazelles left in the world, but several members of these rare species have been born in the San Diego Zoo." Two fantastic photographs show a mother and baby of both species. Young Careers Read- Along Book Bags. Mahwah , NJ: Troll Associates , 1990. The series' 14 hard- cover books with accompanying read-along cas- settes for children in grades K-3 feature careers from airline pilot to veterinarian. We examined them in terms of Burke's criteria with favorable results. In order to assure accurate information, each author and illustrator was guided by a con- sultant with the same vocation. The narrative text is clear and interesting, and terms which may be unfamiliar are explained within context. The il- lustrations are well-integrated with the text, and labels are often provided to aid understanding of specialized vocabulary. One of our first graders read and reread What's It Like to be an Astro- naut to learn about his chosen profession. He said he particularly liked the labeled pictures. "If you don't know what a control tower or a radar dome looks like, it shows you." He also enjoyed the humorous context in which gravity was dis- cussed as he quoted, "I'd try to figure out how to keep the whipped cream from floating off the top of a hot-fudge sundae!" Learn- About Read- Along Book Bags and Easy Biography Read-Along Book Bags. Mahwah , NJ : Troll Associates, ¡990. Each of these collections contains 10 attractive hardcover books and matching word-for-word cassettes. The Learn- About series features nature topics such as spi- ders, earthquakes and volcanoes, and the rain forest. The biographies include a variety of fa- mous men and women. Joyce says that her third graders enjoyed the biography collection because of its focus on the childhood of the subjects. The students were in- trigued that Willie Mays learned to hold a base- ball as a baby and that Houdini taught himself acrobatics and rope-tying tricks at a young age. Some students did think that the illustrations would be enhanced if color had been used. The books in the nature collection are beau- tifully illustrated in bold colors. The text as well as the illustrations are clear, informative, and 506</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS AND REFLECTIONS pleasing. The cassette tapes complement the nar- rative with matching sound effects such as ocean waves, bird calls, and appropriate background music. Let's Celebrate. Englewood Cliffs , NJ : Silver Burdett Press , ¡990. These hardbound biogra- phies are well organized and informative so that children can explore the lives of these unique American heroes: Martin Luther King, Jr., George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Christopher Columbus, Harriet Tubman, and Priscilla Alden. Joyce's third-grade class was attracted to the full-color illustrations. The children were espe- cially impressed by the strong feelings and emo- tions captured by illustrator Floyd Cooper in Martin Luther King , Jr. and His Birthday. What Made Them Great (Series). Englewood Cliffs , NJ : Silver Burdett Press , ¡990. This series' eight books, targeted for children ages 10-13, fea- ture Christopher Columbus, Marie Curie, Anne Frank, Abraham Lincoln, Ferdinand Magellan, Florence Nightingale, Albert Schweitzer, and Leonardo DaVinci. Each book provides a wealth of information about each person from birth to death. We particularly liked the historical time line at the back of the books tracing important events in the characters' lives with corresponding important world events. Reflections When our group of reviewers reflected upon the information we present in this column, we con- cluded that there seems to be an increased inter- est in the instruction of informational text within a whole literacy setting. We discovered some ef- fective ideas for enhancing students' understand- ing of and interest in nonfiction, both in the excellent professional literature we have shared, as well as through the delightful materials de- signed for students. When we reflected upon the process of devel- oping this column, we discovered that our learn- ing and sharing together as a community of professionals is consistent with the recommenda- tions made in the books we reviewed. Collins' words about her classroom community apply to us as well: "We worked, corrected, reworked, and created in collaboration." As Graves sug- gests, we are discovering our own literacy and through the process are becoming more effective models and collaborators for the students with whom we work. 507</page></plain_text>
