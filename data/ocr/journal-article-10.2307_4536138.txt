<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO SOLITUDES: THE BEHAVIOUR OF PIGEONS IN COMPETITIVE FEEDING by C.M.S. PLOWRIGHTI), D. CHURCH, 0. SOGBEIN, A. POTVIN and L. GAGNON2) (University of Ottawa) (Acc. 22-1-2004) Summary Previous research showed that pigeons foraging for preferred grains of maize and less pre- ferred grains of wheat respond to the presence of a competitor by becoming less choosy (i.e. they more readily choose wheat). We extended this work by disentangling the presence of the competitor from the resource depletion associated with it. In Experiment 1, eight birds foraged for maize and wheat in a flight cage. They were tested both alone and with another bird in different foraging sessions. Two groups were formed and differed in how they were treated when the birds foraged in pairs: both birds had access to food (Both Eat) versus only one bird had access to food (Only One Eats) while the other was placed behind a transparent curtain. For the latter treatment, no effect of the mere presence of the other bird on choice was found. Pigeons were, however, less choosy in the presence of a real competitor that exploited the food. At the end of the experiment, the pigeons that had been tested in the 'Both Eat' treatment, were tested in the 'Only One Eats' treatment. They behaved as if foraging alone. Experiment 2 introduced a new condition in which one bird ate and the other was placed behind the curtain where it pecked at grain but could not eat it. Even though this other bird behaved as if it were a potential competitor, it had no effect on the forager in the pair. The only significant difference in choice proportions was between birds foraging in real competition (i.e. where the other bird caused resource depletion) or not. In competitive feeding situations, pigeons react to what is most directly associated with the dwindling food conditions but are insensitive to the presence and to the pecking behaviour of the animal that creates them. 1) Corresponding author's address: School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, 145 Jean- Jacgues Lussier Street, Ottawa, Canada, KIN 6N5; e-mail address: cplowrit@uottawa.ca 2) This research was supported by a research grant to C.M.S.P., undergraduate summer research awards to O.S., A.P. and L.G., and a graduate scholarship to D.C. from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Some food types always seem more appealing to the consumer than others, at least when animals are in the 'reasonably well fed' range of body weight. Pigeons have preferences, some of which are idiosyncratic (Moon &amp; Zeigler, 1979), where preference means a tendency to eat more of a food type than would be expected based on its abundance (Chesson, 1983). In the present study, however, the food pref- erences of pigeons are uniform: virtually all the pigeons we have used in this study and two prior experiments (Plowright &amp; Redmond, 1996; Plowright &amp; Landry, 2000) chose larger grains of maize over smaller grains of wheat when these were simultaneously available. This paper investigates the effect of intra-specific, exploitative competi- tion on food choice by pigeons. As in our previous work, both maize and wheat were provided in a flight cage, and the food choices of pigeons were examined, both when they foraged alone and when they foraged with a com- petitor. Because all the food is presented simultaneously and the pigeon's choice is which food items to approach and ingest, the task is different from a diet selection task in which food items are presented sequentially and the animal decides whether to accept or reject each one (e.g. Plowright &amp; Shettleworth, 1991; Plowright et al., 1995). The competitive situation is 'exploitative competition' (Mitchell, 1990; Sih, 1993) in the sense that the competitor causes resource depletion but does not actively interfere with the other bird. We have found that during exploitative competition pigeons be- come less choosy: grains of wheat are taken more readily than grains of maize (Plowright &amp; Redmond, 1996) and this is true even in the first two choices (Plowright &amp; Landry, 2000). These findings parallel those of Inman et al. (1987) who found that when two feral pigeons started out with the same preference for peas versus vetch, there was a shift in their choice proportions towards the less preferred food type in competition. They also coincide with anecdotal observations of pigeons in parks being fed peanuts and pieces of bread: when foraging alone they select only peanuts, but when in the pres- ence of the competitor they take bread as well. What we describe may or may not reflect what animals ought to do to maximize a currency according to any optimality predictions. The focus of this paper is on what the pigeons do in competition and how they do it, and in particular, on the extent to</page><page sequence="3">COMPETITIVE FEEDING 409 which pigeons foraging in pairs respond to each other vs respond to the food depletion associated with each other. To the extent that foraging in pairs captures an element of the natural sit- uation of flock feeding, our research is relevant to ecological work on group foraging in birds (e.g. Giraldeau, 1984; Giraldeau &amp; Lefebvre, 1986). One difficulty in extrapolating from this research, however, is that the tasks used are different. While our studies (also Inman et al., 1987) examine choice of two food types depending on whether one or two birds have access to the same food, other work on group foraging has examined observational learning of a food finding technique, in which case roles of the individu- als are asymmetrical: some act as tutors and others as learners (Lefebvre &amp; Giraldeau, 1994; Lefebvre &amp; Helder, 1997). Nonetheless, one important conclusion emerges from this work: the crucial factor in social learning is not so much group living per se, but rather the dynamics of the group living. Factors such as territoriality vs gregariousness (Carlier &amp; Lefebvre, 1996; Dolman et al., 1996; Lefebvre et al., 1996), number of bystanders and tu- tors (Lefebvre &amp; Giraldeau, 1994; Lefebvre &amp; Helder, 1997) and behaviour of the learner (Giraldeau &amp; Lefebvre, 1987) all conspire to determine the extent of social learning. In our foraging situation, what if anything the pigeons learn from each other is unknown and can not be inferred from the very fact that they be- have differently alone and in competition. One bird might react directly to another if, for instance, it had learned to use it as a cue predictive of food depletion. Alternatively, foragers may attend only to what is immediately in front of their beaks: the food and not the competitor. As suggested by the work of Giraldeau &amp; Lefebvre (1987), the very behaviour of foraging may preclude attention to the other bird and may impede any social learning. In- deed, as noted by Shettleworth (1998), the study of social behavior includes many illustrations of how one animal responds not so much to another an- imal per se, but to the conditions set up by the other animal (e.g. Galef &amp; Giraldeau, 2001). For example, in food finding one bird may attract another to the food so that it can learn for itself how to handle it (Sherry &amp; Galef, 1984, 1990). Viewed in this perspective, social behaviour is not social at all. Results have been mixed as to the extent to which different bird species use public information and visually monitor other individuals (Templeton &amp; Giraldeau, 1995; Marchetti &amp; Drent, 2000; Smith et al., 2001; Beauchamp, 2002).</page><page sequence="4">410 PLOWRIGHT, CHURCH, SOGBEIN, POTVIN &amp; GAGNON Nature confounds two variables in our foraging situation: the presence of the competitor itself and the resource depletion that it causes. In our previous work, we used the strategy of statistical control of food availability in order to determine whether the competitor itself had an effect (Plowright &amp; Redmond, 1996). We found no effect of the presence of the competitor after food availability had been controlled for. For instance, given that five grains of maize were available, the birds chose wheat approximately 30% of the time, regardless of whether they were foraging alone or in competition. Here we take a different tack: the two variables of presence of competitor and food depletion are dissociated experimentally. Below we report the results of two experiments. In Experiment 1, we addressed the two following questions: (1) Does the effect of the competitor depend on the other bird eating the food? In our previous work when the birds foraged in competition, both birds always ate the food. Here, we introduce a new manipulation (see Fig. 1): when the birds ate in pairs, one bird in the pair either ate the food or did not. (2) Once birds were exposed to competition, did they learn that the second bird is a predictive cue to resource depletion? When the competitor can no longer deplete the food, does a bird forage as if it were still in an exploitative competition situation or does it behave as if it were alone? (3) Experiment 2 addressed one further question: is the effect of the other bird eating food due to the actual resource depletion it causes or only to its pecking behaviour? In other words, for a competitor to have an effect, it may not be necessary for it to actually compete but only to behave as if it were competing. In Experiment 2 we introduced a new condition in which the other bird still did not eat food but it pecked at dishes in which the food could not be removed because it was covered with clear plastic. In this way the other bird did not cause resource depletion but yet behaved as a potential competitor. We asked whether birds foraging in this condition would behave as if alone or as if in real competition. Experiment 1 Methods Subjects Eight White King pigeons were tested in the experiment. Nine were trained as described below, but one of these was excluded because it showed no preference of maize over wheat.</page><page sequence="5">COMPETITIVE FEEDING 411 All had previously been used in operant studies of visual pattern discrimination. They also all had previously been housed in a group in the flight cage that was used as a testing arena in this experiment. Their food intake was supplemented after training and testing sessions to maintain 90% free-feeding body weight. Our prior research (Plowright &amp; Redmond, 1996) showed that if body weight dropped much below 90% then the birds became unselective. Water and grit were freely available except during training and testing sessions. Testing arena Pigeons were trained and tested in a metal framed and screened flight cage (3.4 m high x 2.6 m long x 2.1 m wide). The cage was divided down its width by a clear plastic curtain suspended from a wire drawn across the cage half way down from the ceiling. The floor was completely covered with sawdust. Training Training lasted 5 weeks. Eight white ceramic bowls (6.5 cm in diameter, 4 cm deep) were placed in a rectangular array (2 x 4) with 3 cm separating the 2 columns and each of the 4 rows. Four bowls contained a single grain of maize and four contained a single grain of wheat, with a new random placement of the grains each day. After three weeks a consistent preference for the maize developed: in their first four choices eight of the nine birds ate a minimum of 3 out of 4 grains of maize. During the last week of training all the grains were covered with a thin layer of sawdust. A yellow card was placed under each bowl containing maize. In this last week, all birds showed a preference for maize (as described above) for three consecutive days before the experimental phase began. Procedure and design In the experimental phase of this study, four bowls contained three grains of maize and four bowls contained three grains of wheat. As in previous work (Plowright &amp; Landry, 2000), the bowls with maize were covered with a thick layer or sawdust (about 3/4 full) while the bowls with wheat were barely covered (1/10 full). In this way the birds might be less likely to persist in searching for the maize and more likely to choose wheat when foraging in competition. The spacing between bowls was increased from 3 cm to 17 cm. Every day each pigeon was tested in two sessions: one in the morning and one in the afternoon. A session ended either when all the food was eaten or 10 min after the last bird (i.e. the only bird when foraging alone, or the second bird in a pair when foraging in pairs) was introduced into the cage, whichever came sooner. Typically all the food was eaten well within five minutes. A different treatment was used in each session: in one of the sessions the bird was tested alone and in the other session it was tested with another bird. The eight pigeons were randomly assigned to two groups of four. Testing took place over 4 Blocks of 6 Days. The structure of a Block of 6 Days is given in Table 1. The design was counterbalanced for order of testing: on 3 days each bird was tested in the morning alone and in the afternoon with another bird, and on 3 days, it was the reverse. Every morning and every afternoon, two birds in each group were tested alone and the other two were tested as a pair. Every two days the pairing of the birds was changed so that each bird was paired with every other over 6 days.</page><page sequence="6">412 PLOWRIGHT, CHURCH, SOGBEIN, POTVIN &amp; GAGNON For the first 3 Blocks of 6 Days, when the birds in Group 1 were tested in pairs both pigeons were on the same side of the curtain as the food as illustrated in Fig. 1. Both pigeons ate ('Both Eat' treatment) and so the competitor caused resource depletion. For Group 2, when the birds were tested in pairs, only one bird had access to the food ('Only One Eats' treatment) while the other was placed behind the clear plastic curtain. In this way, one bird was eating in the presence of another bird that did not cause any food depletion. When birds were tested in pairs in the Only One Eats treatment, first one had access to food while the other did not and then immediately after their roles were reversed. For instance, on Day 1, Pigeon 38 would eat while Pigeon 28 remained behind the curtain (see Table 1). Immediately after this session, the two pigeons were paired again, after the bowls were refilled: Pigeon 28 would eat while Pigeon 38 remained behind the curtain. In this way, data could be collected from each member of the pair. TABLE 1.

The eight circles represent the bowls of food: 4 bowls of maize and 4 bowls of wheat in different arrangements in different sessions. The dotted line represents a transparent curtain. For the fourth Block of 6 Days, the treatments for each group were switched, as illustrated in Fig. 1. When tested in pairs, the birds in Group 1 (which were first given the Both Eat treatment) were given the Only One Eats treatment, whereas the birds in Group 2 (which were previously given the Only One Eats treatment) were given the Both Eat treatment. Foraging sessions were filmed with a Sony VideoHi8 Handycam video recorder. Each choice of bowl (containing maize or wheat) by each bird was recorded. Usually the pigeon ate all the food in a bowl, but a choice was still recorded even if it did not take all the grains in the bowl. Pigeons were identified with a coloured mark on the back or on the back of the neck. Statistical analysis Because the data were binary (choice of a bowl containing maize versus wheat), a logistic model, which specifies a binomial error term, was used (as in Plowright &amp; Redmond, 1996; Plowright &amp; Landry, 2000). The data were analyzed using GLIM (Generalized Linear Inter- active Modelling Version 4.0 (Francis et al., 1993)). The tests of significance are x2 tests (but note that these are not x2 tests of independence). In all analyses the variation due to individual birds was taken into account prior to testing for the effect of foraging treatment.</page><page sequence="8">414 PLOWRIGHT, CHURCH, SOGBEIN, POTVIN &amp; GAGNON Results and discussion Because there are only eight bowls of food, the true choices within a session become more and more limited so that by the last bowl, there is no choice at all. Moreover, in the 'Both Eat' treatment, this point comes sooner than when the birds forage alone. Accordingly, only the first few choices were examined. We used the first two choices, after having examined that there was no significant difference between the first and second choice (X(2) = 0.8, p &gt; 0.05). The choice proportions, based on the first two choices, when the birds foraged alone or in pairs, are shown for Group 1 in Fig. 2a. Over the first 3 blocks, an increase in the proportion of choices for maize developed (X(2) = 7.8, p &amp;lt; 0.025). The birds chose maize significantly more of- ten when foraging alone than when foraging in pairs where both birds eat (X(21) = 4.8, p &amp;lt; 0.05), and this effect did not interact with Block of Days (X(22) = 2. 1, p &gt; 0.05). The two bars on the right side of Figure 2a illustrate that overall the effect of foraging alone was approximately a 10% increase in the proportion of choices of maize. The results for Group 2 are shown in Fig. 2b. Already in Block 1, the choice proportions for maize were higher than for Group 1, and so there was no opportunity for an increase over time: the effect of Block of Days was not significant (X) = 5.8, p &gt; 0.05). Contrary to the results for Group 1, no effect of whether the birds foraged alone or in pairs was detected (x) = 0.1, p &gt; 0.05). The interaction with Block of Days was not significant (X(2) = 2.9, p &gt; 0.05). In Group 2 the failure to find an effect of whether the birds foraged alone or in pairs might reflect a ceiling effect. Accordingly, we extended the analy- sis of choice from the first two to the first four choices, which would include some more choices of wheat. The comparison is legitimate since in both cases only one bird causes the resource depletion. Even when the choice pro- portions were below the top of the scale, no difference emerged: the choice proportions were, overall, 0.86 when foraging alone and 0.89 when foraging in pairs. The choice proportions for Block 4, when the treatments were switched, are shown in Fig. 3. For Group 1, where now only one bird eats when the birds are paired, the birds having access to food behaved as if alone: the effect of the other bird, which was present in Blocks 1-3 (Fig. 2a), has disappeared</page><page sequence="9">COMPETITIVE FEEDING 415 0 Alone Group 1: Both Eat i Palred 0~~~~~~~0 sS() 1 2 3 Overall s a Block 0~~~~~~~0 0 x0 °Group 2: Only One Eats 1 2 3 Overall (b) Block Fig. 2.

The interaction of group with foraging alone/in pairs was significant (X(1) = 7.2, p &amp;lt; 0.01). To examine the uninteresting possibility that the bird behind the curtain was inlvisible to the forager, even though it was clearly visible to human observers, foraging speed was examined as an index of sensitivity to the presence of the other bird. The average times to make the first four choices in Block 4 for Group 2 when foraging alone and in pairs, respectively, were:</page><page sequence="10">416 PLOWRIGHT, CHURCH, SOGBEIN, POTVIN &amp; GAGNON Nj (a) Group 1: Only One Eats (b) Group 2: Both Eat 0 0 0 0.6-06 FL 0.2_- 02 Alone Paired Alone Paired Fig. 3.

A paired t-test revealed that the difference was significant for Bird #34 (t(5) = 2.76, p &amp;lt; 0.05) and so the transparent curtain must have allowed the birds to see each other. For the other three birds the difference was not significant, though it was in the expected direction (i.e. foraging faster in the presence of another bird) for Bird #33. In summary, when one bird was in competition with another (Both Eat), it chose maize less frequently on its first two choices than when it foraged alone. If the other bird was merely present (Only One Eats), the forager be- haved as if alone. The two conditions in which the birds were tested in pairs differed in two ways: in the Both Eat condition there was resource deple- tion and the other bird pecked at grain, and in the Only One Eats condition there was no resource depletion and the other bird did not peck at grain (it just walked around because there was no food on its side of the curtain). Experiment 2 was designed to investigate whether the difference between the two conditions was maintained if the other bird caused no resource de- pletion (Only One Eats) but yet behaved in a way resembling that of a true competitor.</page><page sequence="11">COMPETITIVE FEEDING 417 Experiment 2 Using another bird as a stimulus to which a forager might or might not react has its drawbacks. In Experiment 1 when the other bird did not eat food, not only did it fail to cause resource depletion but it also did not even appear to be eating food. The effect of competition seen in Experiment 1 might have been due to the resource depletion caused by the other bird or possibly only by its feeding movements, which might create a perceived threat of competition. To address this possibility, we attempted to control the behaviour of the bird behind the curtain. We provided it with dishes full of grain that had been covered with clear plastic. The birds pecked at these dishes, though they could not consume any food, and fortunately continued to do so over the course of the experiment. Methods The eight pigeons from Experiment 1 and two new pigeons that had not been used in food competition studies were used. The methods, including training, were as in Experiment I with the following modifications. Four bowls of wheat were added in an effort to bring down the choice proportions of maize from the top of the scale. The quantity in each bowl was reduced: 2 grains of wheat in the wheat bowls and 2 grains of maize in the maize bowls. The presentation was simplified by putting the grains in clear petri dishes lined with sandpaper (no sawdust and no distinctive marks for the dishes). The spacing of the dishes during testing was 30 cm between each of the two rows on each side of the curtain, and 10 cm between dishes in the same row. The design of the experiment is shown in Fig. 4. In addition to the conditions in Experi- ment 1, we added a new condition in which the pigeon on the other side of the clear plastic screen would have access to food bowls which were filled with mixed grain and covered with a coat of urethane. In so doing, the number of food bowls doubled, so we included the number of bowls as a variable that was crossed with foraging condition, giving 6 conditions in all. Each pigeon was tested in each condition over 6 days. For 6 pigeons, the 6 conditions in a Block of 6 days were administered in a Latin Square Design. For the other four pigeons, a random order was used. In the conditions where the pigeons were placed in pairs, the 'other bird' (i.e. the bird on the other side of the curtain from the one whose behaviour was being observed) was either a pigeon that had already been tested or one of 3 other pigeons that were only used as 'stimuli'. In the condition where the other pigeon was given access to urethaned dishes of food, it was important that the pecking behaviour not be extinguished, and so each pigeon that was used as the 'stimulus' was used only once per block, with the exception of one bird that was used twice.</page><page sequence="12">418 PLOWRIGHT, CHURCH, SOGBEIN, POTVIN &amp; GAGNON Alone 12 bowls 24 bowls 00: 00: 00 00- 00. 00 00* 00000 00. 00. 00 Only One Eats Urethaned (4 00 :: 000 00 o00 00 00 00 00 00 00oo:o 00 ~ 00 00 Both Eat :Z00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ~ 00 0 0 00 00 00 00 00 00 Fig. 4.

The twelve circles represent bowls of food: 4 bowls of maize and 8 bowls of wheat in different arrangements in different sessions. The dotted line represents a transparent curtain.

Results and discussion Unlike in Experiment 1, a significant decline in choice proportions for maize was found between the first and second choice (X(1) = 7.7, p &amp;lt; 0.01) and so we restricted our analysis to only the first trial and not the first two. Figure 5 shows the group means over the 3 Blocks of 6 days for the 3 situations where (1) the birds foraged alone, (2) foraged with another bird that did not eat (Only One Eats), and (3) foraged with another bird that did eat (Both Eat).

When the birds were tested in pairs, the other bird either ate (Both Eat) or did not eat (Only One Eats). The point of possible disappearance of the birds' preference for mai.ze (0.33) is shown on the dotted line. The comparison between foraging alone and in pairs when the other bird did not eat was not significant (NS). When the birds were tested in pairs, they chose maize significantly less often when the other bird ate compared to when it did not (*p &amp;lt; 0.025). Though the effect of number of bowls was not significant, the data are presented for all 6 conditions at the bottom of the figure to show the condition in which the other bird pecked but did not eat from urethaned bowls. of the bird itself had an effect on choice. A comparison of the second and third situation tested for whether, when birds foraged in pairs, it made a difference whether the other bird ate or not. In both comparisons, the effect of number of bowls was not significant (X(1) =0.0 in both cases), and so the data in Figure 5 are collapsed for this variable. Birds foraging alone behaved no differently from when they were in pairs with another bird that did not eat (X(1) = 1.8, NS) and there was no inter- action with number of bowls (X() = 1.4, NS) or block of days (X t) = 1.1, NS), though an overall decline in choice proportions over time was found</page><page sequence="14">420 PLOWRIGHT, CHURCH, SOGBEIN, POTVIN &amp; GAGNON (X2) = 8.5, p &amp;lt; 0.025). The overall proportions show a significant effect of whether the birds in pairs were in competition or not (X1) = 5.8, p &amp;lt; 0.025), and no interaction with number of bowls (X1) = 1.5, NS) or with block of days (X2) = 1.8, NS). When the birds were in true competition they were less choosy. Even though there were no main effects or interactions with number of bowls, the bottom of Fig. 5 shows the overall averages for all 6 conditions separately so that the behaviour of the pigeons in one key condition could be seen. In the condition where the birds foraged in pairs, but only one ate, and there were 24 bowls, the foragers were exposed to another bird that pecked but did not ingest food. There was no suggestion that the birds foraging in this condition behaved as if they were in the presence of a real competitor: the choice proportion in this condition (0.89) was the highest of the 6 conditions. In comparison, the lowest choice proportion (0.67) was in the condition where there were also 24 bowls and also another bird that not only pecked but also ingested the food. In summary, Experiment 2 showed that the key variable in the effect of a competitor on choice is not the presence of another bird, nor even the pecking behaviour of another bird, but ingestion of food by that bird. General discussion This study replicated for the third time the main result of our previous re- search (Plowright &amp; Landry, 2000; Plowright &amp; Redmond, 1996), which was that pigeons foraging in an exploitative competition situation are less choosy: they take less preferred grains of wheat more readily, even on their first choice (Experiment 2) or first two choices (Experiment 1). The results also parallel those of Inman et al. (1987) described previously. The present study experimentally dissociated the mere presence of an- other bird with the resource depletion that it caused. The procedure in Ex- periment 1 allowed us to answer two questions. First, must a competitor eat the food that would otherwise be available to a forager in order for the for- ager to react? The comparison between the two groups in Fig. 2 shows that when a forager is in the mere presence of another, it behaves as if foraging alone in its first two choices (Fig. 2b). This failure to find an effect could not be attributed to a ceiling effect, because no effect was found in the first</page><page sequence="15">COMPETITIVE FEEDING 421 four choices either. Only when the competitor eats the food does the for- ager adjust its choices (Fig. 2a). The same conclusions could be drawn in Experiment 2 (Fig. 5). The second question was whether, once a bird had experience with a real competitor (i.e. experience in the 'Both Eat' situation) then might the mere presence of the other bird in the 'Only One Eats' situation act as a cue to imminent food depletion? Again, in spite of the prior experience in competitive feeding, the birds foraging in the 'Only One Eats' situation behaved as if alone in the presence of another pigeon (Fig. 3a), though the birds in the other group (Fig. 3b) adjusted their choices in response to a real competitor. The significantly faster foraging speed of one of the birds, when another bird was behind the transparent curtain, showed that nothing obstructed the birds' view of each other. The third question in this study was addressed in Experiment 2: is the difference between the two groups foraging in pairs ('Both Eat' vs 'Only One Eats') attributable to the fact that when both birds eat there is resource depletion by the other bird, or is it just that the other bird behaves differently? The design of Experiment 2 included a condition in which one bird foraged while the other bird behind the transparent screen had access to bowls of food that were covered with clear plastic, so it pecked at grain yet did not ingest it. In spite of simulating the behaviour of a true competitor, this other bird still had no effect on the forager. The same results as in Experiment 1 were obtained: (1) A significant difference in the choices of birds when they were faced with a true competitor compared to when they were not. (2) No difference in the choices of birds foraging alone or in the presence of another (whether the other one was just walking around as in Experiment 1 or whether it was pecking at urethaned bowls). One caveat, however, is that the birds pecking at urethaned bowls of grain likely did not peck at the grain as vigorously as birds that had the opportunity to ingest the food: food that the animal can not eat can hardly be as motivating as food that it can, and so the behaviours in the two conditions, to which the foragers might react, were not completely equated. The challenge for further research would be to develop a way of making a bird behave even more convincingly as if it were eating food without eating food (and letting the animal eat the food would not solve the problem because then, even if it were behind a plastic curtain, it would likely be perceived as causing resource depletion). At this point we can only conclude that the difference between the two conditions</page><page sequence="16">422 PLOWRIGHT, CHURCH, SOGBEIN, POTVIN &amp; GAGNON is very closely tied to resource depletion: it may reflect the disappearance of food from the ground or the ingestive behaviour of the competitor, the two being inextricably linked. One way in which our results differed from our previous work, is that the effect of the competitor (Fig. 2a, Fig. 5) did not take much if any time to develop, though in Experiment 1 there was (as in Plowright &amp; Landry, 2000) a significant increase in choosiness over time when the birds foraged alone. Our birds may have been prepared for this study, in terms of reacting to a true competitor, by their prior experience in a group in the flight cage (in our previous research, the birds had been housed in individual cages prior to the experiment). Moreover, this prior experience might also well explain why the birds failed to react to each other: perhaps the presence of another bird is a poor predictor of food conditions. Another bird, far from signaling immi- nent food depletion, might sometimes signal discovery of food (Galef &amp; Gi- raldeau, 2001). This possibility might be investigated by manipulating prior histories. Even if prior history were an important consideration, however, it would not undermine our conclusion that the mere presence of another bird matters little when prior history resembles the experience of flocks of birds in natural conditions. Casual observers of pigeons in competitive feeding, in the lab or perhaps in a public park, might describe their behavior in anthropomorphic terms, along the lines of "The pigeon is thinking 'If I don't take this wheat now, I might get nothing at all because that other pigeon will eat everything be- fore me'". Although these sorts of interpretations are characteristic of non- scientific writings, making unwarranted assumptions regarding conscious- ness and awareness, they do occasionally make their way in to the scientific literature (see Rivas &amp; Burghardt, 2002). At any rate, our results rule out any such interpretation. They show, on the contrary, that the behaviour of the pi- geons in a social situation is not social at all: the pigeons in our study did not react to each other, and are well described as 'Two Solitudes.'
