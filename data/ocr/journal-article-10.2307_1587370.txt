<plain_text><page sequence="1">PATRIZIA GRANZIERA CONCEPT OF THE GARDEN IN PRE-HISPANIC MEXICO1 The famous Aztec royal gardens amazed the first conquerors for their variety, extent and elaborate layouts. There were royal gardens in and near the Aztec capital in Tenochitlan, Chapultepec, Huastepec, Ixtapalapa, el Pefion, Tetzcoco as well as in more distant locations like Atlixco (Puebla). Gardens of the elite, as with those on the temple grounds, were maintained by a large labour force and contained ornamental, aromatic and medicinal plants. In a world like the pre-Hispanic one, where man was intimately connected with nature and where flowers, plants and trees were thought to have a soul like human beings, gardens certainly played an important role in the urban landscape. This paper will try to explain the symbolic meaning of these gardens, showing how they may have reflected some concepts of the pre-Columbian world view. In Mesoamerica, the whole of the cosmos was animate: the cosmic forces earth, water, wind and earthquake were seen as animated beings and were incorporated into myth and religion. One of the most important myths recounted in the sixteenth-century literature was the creation of the Earth and the Sky. The myth describes the formation of the Earth and Sky as the tearing apart of the goddess Tlaltecuhtli. Tlaltecuhtli was a monstrous being with eyes and mouths in her joints, who floated in a great sea. From parts of her body, hills and valleys, trees and plants were created. Her hair turned into trees, flowers and herbs; her eyes became springs and caves; her mouth rivers and large caverns; her nose mountains and valleys.2 It is easy to see that with a mythological tradition such as this, all geographical phenomena were seen as both animate and sacred. The Sun, Moon, Earth, Water and Fire were the main forces in the Mesoamerican Pantheon. Another important myth was the creation of the Fifth Sun, or our World. According to Sahagun's account, there was Earth but no Sun or Moon. Therefore, the gods sacrificed themselves so that these heavenly bodies could be created and the Sun could feed on the blood and thus move across the sky.3 The gods died in the process of creation but their divine substance, 'soul', was present in all the elements of creation: stones, minerals, trees, plants, human beings and planets. For this reason, the deities were represented in anthropomorphic form as well as in the form of animals and flora (Figure i). This reverence for nature was reported with amazement by the friars Motolinia, Bartolome de las Casas4 and Duran. The latter wrote: Thus they passed their lives among the flowers in such blindness and darkness, since they had been deceived and persuaded by the devil, who had observed their love for blossoms and flowers ... even the bark of resinous trees was revered so that it would create a good fire.

Maize (Zea mays L.), the Mesoamerican staple crop which played an important role in the development of Mesoamerican agriculture, was considered to be one of the gods. In the Nahuatl language, 'theocintli' (maize) means 'food of the gods'. Many plants and flowers were related to gods. The quetzalmizquitl (Parkinsonia aculeata L.)6 (Figure z), a cactus plant with large leaves that looked like feathers, was considered sacred and it was associated with Quetzalcoatl, the plumed serpent, one of the most important Aztec gods.7 Cihualcoatl-Quilaztli (woman serpent), one of the multiple aspects of the Mother Goddess, a deity who helps women during delivery and pregnancy and also protects the vegetal process (quilitl means vegetable), was associated with the cempoalxochitl (twenty flower) or flower of the dead. This flower, Tagetes (erecta Linn.),8 continues to play a prominent role in the autumn festival honouring the dead.9 Figure i. Birth of a deity.

The Goddess Xochiquetzal (flower-feather), patron of artesans and sexual love, was associated with the flower izquixochitl (Bourreira huanita Hemsl.),10 a flower that, according to Francisco Hernandez, was very much appreciated for its fragrant smell and curative properties. It was mixed with cacao to make chocolatl." The izquixochitl in nahuatl means toasted maize (Izquitl-xochitl) because its seeds pop out like toasted corn. It has been considered a symbol of life, the metaphor of maize, and a basic plant in Mesoamerican alimentation.12 Tlaloc, the God of Rain, was also represented by some hallucinogenic plants that grew on humid soil or in the water. One of them was iyauhtli (Tagetes lucida Cav.), known today as pericon.13 Another interesting plant that could be related to the God Macuilxochitl (five flowers) is the ololiuhqui (Turbina corymbosa Rafin. or Morning Glory)14 as the plant has a five-petalled flower (Figure 3).15 Fertility, flowers, singing and dancing were all associated with Macuilxochitl as well as Xochipilli, the Aztec Prince of Flowers. The famous sculpture of Xochipilli (Figure 4) found on the slopes of the volcano Popocatepetl is decorated with several stylized flowers that have been identified with well-known hallucinogenic plants like ololiuhqui, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and sinicuichi (Heimia salicifolia Link &amp; Otto),16 a sacred mushroom (Psilocybe aztecorum Link &amp; Otto).17 Thus, it has been suggested that Xochipilli undoubtedly represents not simply the Prince of Flowers, but, more specifically, the Prince of Inebriating Flowers including the mushrooms which in Nahuatl poetry were called 'flowers' and 'flowers that intoxicate'.18 Almost all the flowers used in pre-Hispanic world had properties that provoked a state of ecstasy. Eighty to one hundred species of plants produced this condition. For example, in Mexico there are forty-five kinds of tobacco or Nicotiana and seven species of Datura, a plant called by Mexicans toloache19 a modern version of the ancient Nahuatl Toaloatzin (inclined head in reference to its nodding fruit). They were also known as Tolohuaxihuitl and Tlapatl (Figure 5). They were employed not only to induce visual hallucinations, but I87</page><page sequence="4">GARDEN HISTORY 29:2 Figure 3. Ololiuhqui. Florentine Codex, Bk XI, --- _ -f.Iz9'. Medicean Library. also for a great variety of medicinal uses, especially when applied to the body to relieve rheumatic pain and to reduce swellings. In the Codex Badiano (I552), considered the first indian herbal, the plant is mentioned as an analgesic or pain reliever.20 Another plant with hallucinogenic properties is the pipilzintzintli (Salvia divinorum Epling &amp; Jativa), which represents the God Pilzintecuhtli (baby prince), another aspect of Xochipilli and also related to the Sun and sometimes described as the husband of Xochiquetzal.21 All these plants and many others were used for shamanic reasons. They served as a means of communication between man and gods and many of them were considered gods themselves. However, they were also used as medicinal plants. In i65I, the physician of the King of Spain, Hernandez, described the ololiuhqui as having the following qualities: Ololiuhqui, which some call Coaxihuitl or snake plant, is a twining herb with thin, green, cordate leaves; slender, little resin, it banishes chills and stimulates and aids in a remarkable degree in cases of dislocations, fractures, and pelvic troubles of women. The seed has some medicinal use. If pulverized or taken in a decoction or used as a poultice on the head or forehead with milk and chilli, it is said to cure eye troubles. When drunk, it acts as an aphrodisiac. It has a sharp taste and is very hot. Formerly, when the priests wanted to communicate with their gods and to receive a message from them, they ate this plant to induce a delirium. A thousand visions and satanic hallucinations appeared to them. In its manner of action, this plant can be compared with Solanum maniacum of Discorides. It grows in warm places in the fields.22 As might be expected from the high value placed on plants and flowers by Mesoamerican people, gardens were well stocked with ritual and medicinal plants. In aristocratic and royal gardens, magnificent botanical collections acquired an importance beyond the recreational and pleasurable. Since food crops were supplied to the nobility through tribute, these elite gardens excluded practical edible plants and contained instead ornamental, aromatic and medicinal plants associated with ritual needs or emblematic of an high status. In a chapter entitled 'Of the gardens which Montezuma went for recreation', the scholar Cervantes de Salazar reports as follows: This great monarch had many pleasances and spacious gardens with paths and channels for irrigation. These gardens contained only medicinal and aromatic herbs, flowers, native roses, and trees with fragrant blossoms, of which there are many kinds. He ordered his physicians to make experiments with the medicinal herbs and to employ those best known and tried as remedies in healing the diseases of the lords of his court. These gardens gave great pleasures to all who visited them on account of the flower and roses they contained and of the fragrances they gave forth, especially in the mornings and evenings. It was well worth seeing with how much art and delicacy a thousand figures of persons were made by means of leaves and flowers, also seats, chapels, and the other constructions which so greatly adorned these places. In this flower garden Montezuma did not allow any vegetables or fruit to be grown, saying that it was I88</page><page sequence="5">CONCEPT OF THE GARDEN IN PRE-HISPANIC MEXICO V* Figure 4.

He said that vegetable gardens and orchards were for slaves or merchants. At the same time he owned such, but they were far away and he seldom visited them.23 Together with Cervantes, another famous scholar, Lopez de G6mara, confirmed in I552 that Montezuma in his gardens did not include edible plants as those should be grown in the gardens of the lower classes.24 Royal gardens were, in addition, vast collections of plants from the most remote corners of the Aztec tribute empire demonstrating the extent of the empire and the power of the ruling class. Bartolome de las Casas describing the gardens of Montezuma says that he had 'orchards and gardens with all kinds of flowers that one could find in that kingdom, which are not few in number'.25 According to Duran, the plants that composed these royal gardens showed 'the grandeur of Mexican authority who desired to be called and perceived as lords of creation in the water as well as on land ...'.26 The most wonderful of Montezuma's gardens were those in Huastepec (Morelos), probably the oldest botanical gardens in the world. Duran and the historian Tezoz6moc tell us that Montezuma the Elder (I440-69; Ilhuicomina) following the advice of his brother Tlacael decided to lay out the garden of Huastepec. He dispatched messengers to the tropical coast region with the request to the Lord of Cuetlaxtla for plants with roots of cacao (Theobroma cacao L.),27 hueynacaxtli (Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Willd.) Griseb.),28 yolloxochitl (Talauma mexicana G. Don),29 cacahuaxochitl (Quararibea funebris Visch.) (Figure 6),30 izquixochitl (Bourreria huanita Hemsl.), hualcaxochitl (Philodendron pseudoradiatum Matuda) (Figure 7),31 cacaloxochitl (Plumeria acutifolia Poir.),32 tlilxoch- itl (Vanilla planifolia Andrews)33 and other valuable flowers that grew in those hot lands. He also asked that these be brought carefully by native gardeners from the same region 7z; t \;. , , ,ffn ,,. q'e.Ce fiat - d: .. ' Figure 5.

On receiving the message, the Lord of Cuetlaxtla immediately gave orders to have a number of all kinds of plants dug up with their roots enclosed in earth and had the bundles dispatched to Mexico.34 Interestingly enough, almost all these plants are mentioned in the Codex Badiano as a remedy against the tiredness of those who cover public or administrative positions.35 I I9I i - M 0~~:... ..... ... * ? . ?, r ~.,....:: ~O.,*.::ef.

Centre of the five directional trees. Codex Borgia, pl. 53. Angel Palerm Library, CIESAS, Mexico City. It is worth mentioning the ceremony observed by the gardeners after planting the trees. They fasted for eight days, and piercing the upper ears, they sprinkled their blood on the soil. They also made a great sacrifice to the god of flowers offering him many dead quails after having sprinkled the plants with their blood. They assured the people that after observing those ceremonies, none of the plants would be lost and that they would soon bear flowers and fruits.36 This ceremony portrays a mystical relationship held between people and the earth: the people feed the earth their blood and bodies and in return the earth feeds the people by yielding plants. The belief that one's own blood could be exchanged for crop growth was so fundamental that it is represented on Codex Borgia,37 where a maize plant fertilized by blood being drawn from the sexual organs of two kneeling males, sprouts from the body of an earth goddess (Figure 8).38 The botanical gardens of Huastepec were so famous that Dr Hernandez, the Spanish physician who was sent to New Spain by the king to compile a natural history of this country, spent most of his time (I570-77) at Huastepec describing and drawing the plants he saw there.39 This important work, together with the Codex Badiano, is the most important source extant on Mexican medicinal plants. The other garden that Hernandez visited was the garden of Tezcozinco, owned by the famous poet King Nezahualcoyotl. It is reported by Clavijero that this illuminated king loved nature so much that not only did he study plants and animals, but also being unable to have specimens of many of the tropical species, he had pictures of them painted from nature and copied on the wall of his palace: I92</page><page sequence="9">CONCEPT OF THE GARDEN IN PRE-HISPANIC MEXICO Nothing amused Nezahualc6yotl more than the study of nature. He acquired a knowledge of astronomy by frequently observing the movements of stars. He devoted himself to the study of plants and animals, and being unable to have living specimens of many of the tropical species, for climatic reasons, had pictures of all the plants and animals of the Anahuac region painted from nature and copied on the walls of his palace. The famous physician Hernandez was eyewitness to these paintings, as he records in his Historia natural . ..40 Flowers were very much appreciated by Mesoamerican societies because they were offered to the gods, and flowering branches were also given to leaders to strengthen them for their tasks and to affiliate them more closely with the divine powers. Their fragrance was thought to be derived from gods and was equated with leadership. Odoriferous flowers like yolloxochitl (Talauma mexicana G. Don),41 izquixochitl (Bourreria huanita Hemsl.),42 cacaloxochitl (Plumeria acutifolia Poir.),43 tlilxochitl (Vanilla planifolia Andrews)44 were considered a luxury and therefore one of the attributes of the ruling class. Appropriated to some extent by the ruler and the elite, the plants became an indicator of rank that reinforced the social hierarchy in the Aztec Empire.4s The native worshipper used different varieties of flowers for specific purposes, self- consciously aware of their symbolism. Certain herbs and flowers were offered in the spring, for example, while others were selected to celebrate the harvest and at the beginning of the dry season. Almost all the native plants were known for their medicinal effectiveness or psychotropic qualities. Psychotropic plants such as cacao, the ololiuhqui (Turbina corymbosa Rafin.)46 and the toloache (Datura stramonium L.)47 were also claimed by the ruling class who reserved the right to communicate directly with the gods. SACRED TREES Trees in Mesoamerica were similarly significant. Both real and symbolic, they acted as important cosmic metaphors. In Mesoamerican mythology, the world was imagined as floating in a large lake and as having at its centre a mountain or large tree that connected the sky, the earth and the underworld. While the most important and sacred tree was this central tree, Mesoamerican belief also includes references to four other trees at the four corners of the Earth that helped support the sky. The four trees are associated with the four cardinal points, as well as with a specific deity, colour and bird whose identities varied regionally.48 These larger trees usually grow out of a monster mask, the gaping jaw of the earth monster, a sacrificial victim or a crouching earth deity. The most famous examples of this are the trees of the four quarters of the world in the Borgia, Fejervary-Mayer49 (Figure 9) and Vaticanus 37735? codices. In the Codex Fejervary-Mayer, each of the four trees grows out of a terrestrial symbol and is surmounted by a supernatural bird. These birds have been identified with the quetzal (east), yellow macaw (north), blue hummingbird (west) and white sea bird (south). In the Codex Borgia, a full page is devoted to each of the five directional trees of the world. All of these (the Codex Borgia trees) grow out of the bodies of Cihualcoatl figures, female supernaturals in their destructive, death aspects. Mythological trees are also found in the historical Mixtec codices generally at the beginning of the history of the ruling dynasties. In the Codex Vidobonensis,51 an anthropomorphic tree with the head of a goddess at its roots gives birth to the first male and female ancestors of the Mixtec people (Figure io). Trees in pre-Columbian art are generally depicted with their roots growing out of the heads of an earth monster, with fruit flowers growing on them and birds or insects in their branches.52 I93</page><page sequence="10">GARDEN HISTORY 29:2 Figure 9. Five directions of the World. Codex Fejervary Mayer, p. i. Angel Palerm Library. At the classic Maya site of Palenque, an eighth-century Mayan ruler, Pacal, was buried in a stone sarcophagus or tomb. The sculptural design on the lid of the sarcophagus depicts a cross-like tree surmounted by a celestial bird, probably a quetzal. The tree acted as a passage between the land of the living and the dead. Through this 'Tree of Life', Pacal's soul could ascend to the eternal life of a deified ruler. A pre-Hispanic king maintained order in the cosmos. This pivotal role was declared through World Tree symbols that appeared in the case of Mayan society on his sceptre, apron and head- dress.53 Thus, a 'precious willow, a ceiba, a juniper' were often metaphors for a god, the king, a governing official or a teacher.54 As natural metaphors of the World Tree, two important trees were singled out for their size and longevity. These species were the ceiba (Ceiba pentandra Gaertn. or giant silk cotton tree)s5 among the Maya and the ahuehuete (Taxodium mucronatum Tenore.)s6 among the central Mexican people. The ceiba is called the yaxche or yax imixche (green I94 .I 1</page><page sequence="11">CONCEPT OF THE GARDEN IN PRE-HISPANIC MEXICO Figure io. Mixtec creation accounts: a scene of tree birth. Codex Vidobonensis, p. 33. BNAH. tree) in yucatecan Maya. The giant ceiba can attain a height of I40 feet and a trunk diameter of 8 feet. The red colour of the ceiba's new leaves and sap are associated to the bloodlines of a community. The tree can also seemingly 'rejuvenate' as branches of the ceiba take root quickly.57 Like the ceiba in its dimensions and age is the ahuehuete called also sabino or cedar by the Spanish58 and referred to as cypress in eighteenth-century literature.59 Both trees offer a generous shade and symbolize protection and security. The ahuehuete is also mentioned in Aztec mythical history as a mythical couple took refuge in its trunk after the great deluge provoked by the end of one of the cosmogonic Suns: 'Titlacahuan called the one named Tata and his wife called Nene, and he told them: you will not want anything more; you will make a hole in a very big ahuehuetl and get inside it when the eve will come and the sky will sink! . . .60 The ahuehuete has a very long life. The most famous ahuehuete in Mexico is the 'arbol de Tule' in Santa Maria del Tule in the state of Oaxaca. It has a trunk diameter of 36 feet and it is one thousand years old. The tree is also a central part of ceremonies that feature wooden poles such as pole climbing rituals and the Juego del Volador or Flying Pole ceremony of Papantla, Veracruz. In addition, most settlements in ancient Mexico were divided into four original parts built around an intersection, which was then subdivided and which corresponds to the quarters of the world. Often a shrine that was reserved for the gods stood at a crossroad or on a square.61 With all this charge of symbolism, it is not surprising that trees and especially the ahuehuete played an important role in Aztec gardens. As reported in 1844, the base of the hill at Chapultepec gardens was surrounded by a grove of beautiful ahuehuetes: 'The gardens of Moctezuma stretched for miles around the hill ... and the soil there still receives the shade of these gigantic cypresses, with a circumference of more than fifty feet ,62 Some of these trees still survive today in 'El Bosque de Chapultepec'. Motolinia describing the palace of Nezahualcoyotl at the base of Tezcozinco hill also mentions 'a garden containing more than a thousand very large and very beautiful cedars (cypresses) I95</page><page sequence="12">GARDEN HISTORY 29:2 trees ...63 In 1883, the American diplomat Brantz Mayer described the same ancient grove of cypresses, known as 'El Bosque del Contador' and standing in the level plain north-west of Tezcoco, as 'one of the more remarkable relics of the princes and people of Tezcocan monarchy . ..64 and he gave the followings details: the grove is formed by a double row of gigantic cypresses, about five hundred in number, arranged in a square corresponding with the points of the compass and enclosing an area of about ten acres. At the north-western point of this quadrangle another double row of lordly cypresses runs westwardly towards a dyke, north of which there is a deep oblong tank walled and filled with water. ... Along the raised banks and beneath the shadows of the double line of majestic trees were the walks and arbors in which Nezahualcoyotl and his courtiers amused themselves . ..65 In the garden of Huastepec (today a holiday centre) there is also an area still called 'El Bosque' where is the spring of the River Yauhtepec that crosses the state of Morelos. This bosque is characterized by the presence of big trees among which the older are the ahuehuete.66 From the above descriptions, it can also be deduced that the pre-Hispanic garden was composed of two areas. One was near the dwellings of the king where nature was tamed by man and where medicinal and ornamental plants were cultivated around pools, water works and pavilions and another, often referred to in colonial literature as 'El Bosque' (the woods), which stretched into the surrounding natural landscape. This zone was often dedicated to the king's hunting parties. Cervantes de Salazar tells us that Montezuma in addition to his gardens of aromatic and medicinal plants had: houses in extensive groves of trees surrounded by water so that the game could not escape and he could be certain of his quarry. In these woods there were fountains, rivers, tanks with fish, rabbit warrens, steep high rocks among which were stags, fallow deer, hares, foxes, wolves, and other similar animals which the Mexican lords hunted much and very often ....67 ANIMALS Animals were another important feature of these gardens. The first Spanish people who saw them inform us that there were many different species of animals in these gardens. When Cortes reached the town of Iztapalapa, 7 miles distant from Mexico-Tenochtitlan, he wrote enthusiastically about the gardens and the different kinds of birds and fish he saw there: There are both upper and lower rooms and very refreshing gardens with many trees and scented flowers, well constructed bathing places of fresh water with steps leading down to the bottom ... the pool contains many fish and different kinds of waterfowl such as wild duck and garganey, so many in fact that they almost cover the water.68 In Tezcoco, Itlixochitl, a descendant of King Nezahualcoyotl, also reported the presence of many different animals: there were houses for birds, where the king kept all kinds of different birds and animals, serpents and snakes brought from different parts of New Spain, and those he could not have alive, he had them made of precious stone and gold, and the same was true for fish. He had fish from the sea as well as fish which breed in rivers and lagoons, so that not a bird, fish or animal on earth was missing there, either alive or made out of gold and precious stone ....69 However, Cortes and Bartolome de las Casas were even more amazed when they first saw the zoological garden of Montezuma with all kinds of birds, felines, snakes and fish. As De las Casas reported: I96</page><page sequence="13">CONCEPT OF THE GARDEN IN PRE-HISPANIC MEXICO Montezuma not only had houses and lodging for men, but also for beasts, birds and different animals, they were buildings not less big nor remarkable than those for men. He had houses for birds, with many rooms and with corridors built on pillars of jasper, each pillar of a single piece, which in Spain were much valued. These corridors led to a very big orchard, where there were ten or twelve pools, some of salted water for waterfowl that live and breed in salted water and others of sweet water for those who live and breed in this water.... There were in these pools such a big number of waterfowl that all those birds from two hundred leagues of distance seemed to have gathered there. They were of different colours and species and shape that no one of our group knew whether there could be in the world such a variety and number.... There were more than three hundred people that took care of these birds ... he had something else very noteworthy and large with many rooms and lodgings high and low. In some of them there was another kind of fowl, the birds of prey; they were well taken care of like the others. ... In the lower rooms there were cages made of very strong beams where there were lions, tigers, jackals, foxes, wolves and all kinds of ferocious animals.... He would send people to find all these animals and put them in his cages to show the grandeur of his domain, and for this reason the big crocodiles, which we call water lizards, were not missing nor were the small ones and the ferocious snakes, vipers and iguanas ... In others he kept only generous fowl like falcons, goshawk, sparrow hawks, eagles and all such species and in another one he kept kites and vultures of all kinds ....70 The famous zoological garden of Montezuma that impressed the 'conquistadores' so much were not created merely for the recreation of the king. The animals collected there represented probably the 'nahualtin' of the gods. Pre-Hispanic gods also manifested themselves in the form of animals. The goddess Itzpapalotl took the form of a butterfly, Quetzalcoatl of a serpent and Huitzilopochtli of a hummingbird. Actually, gods could appear in the form of more than one animal: Tezcatlipoca (smoking mirror) is sometimes represented as a jaguar, a coyote, zopilote (vulture) or a guajolote (turkey) (Figure II).71 In addition, the myriad fauna in the pre-Columbian menagerie were arranged between the cosmic division sky, earth and the underworld as the universe was thought to be divided vertically into thirteen heavenly layers. The four inferior being the earth and another nine floor below the earth. Certain animals were selected as visual equivalents of this universe, as metaphors for celestial bodies, the surface of the earth or the underworld realm. Some animals were associated with two levels at once. Such animals were more powerful for representing the features of several cosmic realms. The best known is the plumed serpent Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. The fusion of snake and bird combined the forces of sky and earth into a powerful supernatural. These animals were accorded dominion over the heavens and the earth, powers that were adopted by the ruling hierarchy. Generally sky animals were associated with the celestial Sun, the Moon and Venus, where they acted as messengers between man and his deities. Logically, these included many of the birds with particular importance assumed by the eagle, parrot and hummingbird. Birds of prey like the vulture, eagle and falcon were all metaphors of the sun. Their speed and visual acuity were models for the successful hunter and warrior. In Nahuatl, cuauhtli means eagle and the Mexicans called the morning sun cuauhtlehuani or soaring eagle, and the evening sun cuahtemoc or descending sun.72 The eagle (Aquila chrisaetus and other species),73 seen as the supreme solar deity, played a fundamental role in the founding of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. The eagle was also an emblem for one of the Aztec elite warrior organizations. Aztec terms of fearlessness and warfare were given eagle qualifiers. Since these qualities were incarnate in the Aztec ruler, he was 197</page><page sequence="14">GARDEN HISTORY 29:2 ,'= W. !ii! L : :1= , ii.~.i ,e' Figure 11.

It is not surprising that the Aztec ruler Montezuma kept eagles in his garden. The hummingbird (Troquilidae)74 was another solar metaphor associated with the deity of war and sacrifice Hutzilopochtli (hummingbird-left). This bird when cold, during the night or for short periods during winter, can assume a torpid state. For the Aztecs, it appeared to come to life again in the spring at the very time of renewed life and planting. These phenomena were also analogous to the sun's 'rebirth' or rising every morning in the east. His long beak is also a carrier of sexual connotations as it is plunged deeply into the corolla of flowers to suck their nectars.75 Another bird much appreciated especially for its plumage was the quetzal (Pharomacros mocinno).76 Its feathers were as valuable as green gemstones and gold. They were used to adorn gods such as Quetzalcoatl and Xochiquetzal and to decorate their high-class dresses. The Mexican king used to wear a quetzal head-dress. The quetzal was often painted on the cosmic tree of the east, where the sun rises, a cardinal point always associated with fertility, abundance and richness.77 Parrots (Amazona xantocephala)78 and scarlet macaw or guacamaya (Ara macao)79 were the two other birds prized by all Mesoamerican people for their feathers. These birds together with quetzal were among the tropical species demanded as a tribute, to help meet the demand of the Aztecs. They were associated with Venus, the morning star, a sky deity, and because of their prominently green yellow feathers with sprouting corn.80 Snake, toad, turtle, crocodile, armadillo, monkey and frog were all animals associated with the earth and fertility. When it breaks the water surface, the dark green- brown shell of a crocodile or turtle resembles an island. A reptile floating in water was a metaphor for the earth's surface. One Nahua creation myth recounts that primeval earth I98 i'.

Associated with the rain cult, serpents took the form of rain deities or served them in one capacity or another. In classic Mayan imagery, the deity Chac emerges from the jaws of a serpent. The Mexican rain god Tlaloc often holds a snake symbolizing lightening and rainstorms. Serpents were an important insignia of Aztec earth goddesses such as Coatlicue (she of the serpent skirt) (Figure iz) and Chicomecoatl (Seven serpent) the most prominent goddess of corn.83 Beneath the face of the earth lay the underworld, a dark watery realm. The animals representing it were waterbirds, fish, conch shell, jaguar, bat and owl. Waterbirds can fly, swim and also dive beneath the water. As birds that could penetrate all three strata, they had a great cosmological significance. Their feathers were also used in ceremonial dress. As an exclusively nocturnal hunter, the jaguar (Felis onca)84 was thought of as part of the underworld. The animal's high speed and massive strength make it dominant in the tropical forest and inspired man's respect and awe. Priests and rulers alike appropriated the jaguar's valour and power. Olmec, Maya and Aztec chieftains and kings were seated on thrones decorated with jaguar imagery or covered with jaguar pelts. Kings also used to eat its heart to become braver. The jaguar was also connected to the earth, the I99</page><page sequence="16">GARDEN HISTORY 29:2 rains and the night. The starry night was compared to the skin of this animal. A jaguar monster mouth characterized the cave-like opening to the Olmec underworld. In Tenochtitlan, several skulls and a complete skeleton of a jaguar were found among the offerings dedicated to Tlaloc.85 Owing to their value, jaguars were the supreme sacrificial animal. They were also probably kept in captivity for sacrificial purposes. The Aztecs emphasized the jaguar in their war cult as it represented one of their elite military orders. Eagle and jaguar knights were rewarded for their sacrificial courage with lavish honours during life and with the promise of a celestial destination after death. In a sense, the pairing of the jaguar and eagle defined the complementary halves of the cosmological order. The eagle as the supreme day-sun animal represented the sky and air in opposition to the night-sun jaguar associated with watery earth and underworld. The universe was viewed by Mesoamerican people as an interrelated chain dominated by recurring cycles of life and death, day and night, rainy and dry season. The division of the yearly cycle into two parts, one corresponding to the 'day sun' (i.e. dry season) and the other to the 'night sun' (i.e. rainy season) was a fundamental concept of pre-Hispanic vision of the cosmos. Gods, plants and animals were all metaphors of this dualistic system that opposes heaven, light, igneous, masculine, active to earth, moon, darkness, water, feminine, passive. Therefore, one can say that the presence in the royal gardens of animals that represented the sun, sky and heaven, and animals associated with earth and the underworld assured the ties of the elite with cosmological powers and helped the king in his divine task of keeping the order in the cosmos for his people. SYMBOLISM IN PRE-HISPANIC GARDENS Until now, we have seen how the pre-Hispanic garden was a source of medicinal plants and a cosmic paradigm. It is debatable whether it could have also been an embodiment of paradisical ideas. For the Aztecs, there were three possible afterlife alternatives. One was Mictlan or the underworld where common people who died of ordinary sickness went. One had to make a long and dangerous journey to reach this place. After four years of passing between clashing mountains, entering regions guarded by a serpent or a green lizard, resist obsidian-bladed winds and cross a nine-fold river, one would at last reach Mictlan. The purified essence would then go to Tlalocan ready to get out into the world again.86 The second underworld was the House of the Sun (Tonatiuh Ihuicatl), open to warriors, sacrificial victims and women who died in childbirth. In some literary descriptions, the House of the Sun is a plain with maguey cacti and thorny shrubs, but more frequently it is a garden with fragrant flowers and a 'place of wealth a place of joy'.87 The third was Tlalocan, home of the rain god Tlaloc. Tlalocan was a luxuriant terrain reserved for those who died of drowning, leprosy, venereal disease, sores, dropsy and for children sacrificed to Tlaloc. Sahagun described this terrestrial paradise as a place situated in the east, where all rivers originate. A rich fertile soil where all kinds of plants grow, where there are the most beautiful aromatic flowers, cacao trees and hule trees (Castilla elastica Sesse in Cerv.),88 the yolloxochitl (Talauma mexicana G. Don)89 and other odoriferous flowers. All kinds of birds were present - with precious feathers like the quetzal and scarlet macaw and precious stones like jade, turquoise, silver and gold. Tlaocan, he continued, is the place of eternal spring, never is there withering, forever there is sprouting, there is verdure, it is eternally green.90 The Mural of Teopantitla in Teotihuacan was first in identified 1942 as a representation of the Tlalocan described by Sahagun.91 The mural represents several tiny 200</page><page sequence="17">CONCEPT OF THE GARDEN IN PRE-HISPANIC MEXICO 'pJ A.:.U? Figure 1 3. Detail of Teopantitla mural, Teotihuacan. Reproduced in the Teotihuacan Room, MNA. figures swimming, relaxing and playing in a place with rivers, caves, vegetation, birds and butterflies. Recent investigations have recognized some of the plants as maize, oceloxochitl (Tigridia pavonia (L.f.) DC?),92 cacao, toloache (Datura stramonium L.),93 yauhtli (Tagetes lucida Cav.),94 ololiuhqui (Turbina corymnbosa Rafin.)9s and papaver (Papaver somniferunz L.)96 suggesting that part of this paradisical garden was dedicated to the cultivation of medicinal plants (Figure I3). This is also proved by the presence of some figures depicted in the act of curing people (Figure I4).97 If this is the case, the pre- Colombian garden described by the first Spanish eyewitnesses as a place filled with aromatic flowers, medicinal plants, brightly coloured tropical birds, pools and rivulets corresponds to the Mesoamerican concept of a sacred garden heaven. In addition, Tlalocan merged with Tamoanchan, the mythological locus associated with the creation of both the gods and mankind. Like Tlaocan, Tamoanchan had all the positive attributes of a terrestrial paradise 'the place of rain and mist where the children of men are made, 201</page><page sequence="18">GARDEN HISTORY 29:2 Figure 14. Detail of Teopantitla mural, Teotihuacan. One can observe that various figures are depicted in the act of curing people. Reproduced in the Teotihuacan Room, MNA. where the jewelled fish are sought ....98 Thus, Tamoanchan had both celestial and terrestrial features of the 'paradise of origins'. In the codices of central Mexico, Tamoanchan was often represented by an anthropomorphic tree sometimes with fruits and flowers, sometimes broken. In the Cantares Mexicanos, a series of poems in Nahuatl language, it is frequently referred to as a blossoming tree: The Blossoming Tree erect is in Tamoanchan There you were created, there we were given the law; With royal words it made us turn; This god of ours for whom everything lives. Which gold do I cast, which jade do I carve Our brotherly song; Like a turquoise for four times He makes us turn four times in Tamoanchan, Tamoanchan, home of the giver of life.99 Tamoanchan has been identified with the cosmic tree, the axis mundis, centre of the world and place of origin, with its roots in the underworld and its branches in the sky. The scene in the mural of Teopantitla has been interpreted as a representation of Tamoanchan and Tlalocan, and the tree behind the god figure as representing the cosmic tree of Tamoanchan, where opposite forces meet to create the world of man (Figure 15).100 202</page><page sequence="19">CONCEPT OF THE GARDEN IN PRE-HISPANIC MEXICO Figure 15. Detail of Teopantitla mural, Teotihuacan. The tree behind the god figure probably represents the cosmic tree of Tamoanchan. Reproduced in the Teotihuacan Room, MNA. There is more to it. Tlalocan, paradise of the rain god, was in a way the conceptualization of a space underneath the earth full of water, which connected the mountains to the sea. As Sahagin indicates, the ancient inhabitants of Mexico believed that all rivers proceeded from a place called Tlalocan: 'And they say that the mountains were only magic places, with earth and with rock on the surface, that they were only like ollas or like houses, that they were filled with the water which was there ....,101 Large and deep caves were a particularly apt entrance to Tlalocan and Duran tells us that Tlaloc is the 'God of rain, Thunder and Lightening. The Name means Path under the Earth or Long Cave .. ..102 In the codices, it is often depicted inside a mountain or a cave and in the valley around Mexico City there was a sanctuary high up on Mount Tlaloc dedicated to him (Figure i6). The cult of mountains and caves is a fundamental aspect of the cult of Tlaloc, thus associating him with fertility, earth goddesses and the night.103 Mountains and caves were sacred to Mesoamerican people as they were sources of ethnic origins and creation myths (Aztecs traced their origins back to a place called Chicomoztoc or seven caves) they were the domain of the earth gods and thus associated with fertility. According to an Aztec myth, Tonacatepetl 'Sunshine Mountain' or 'Sustenance Mountain' was the mythological source of food crops.'04 It may be exactly for this reason that pre-Hispanic people preferred to build their gardens on top of 203</page><page sequence="20">GARDEN HISTORY 29:2 Figure i6. Tlaloc inside his temple on Mount Tlaloc. Codex Borbonicus, f.z4. Angel Palerm Library. mountains and hills where there were springs and caves. The garden of Chapultepec was laid out on the top of the 'Chapulin' (grasshopper) mountain. Tepetl means mountain in Nahuatl and the spring that issued forth at Chapultepec was canalized to provide the city of Tenochtitlan with water.105 The toponimous of Huastepec is composed of huaxin (guaje) a fruit tree that grows in the area and tepetl, mountain. As we can see from a colonial map of I580 (Figure 17), there were three 'ojos de aguas' or natural pools in Huastepec. One of them is now called 'la Poza Azul' owing to its transparent blue water. The River Yauhtepec here originates and in ancient times it crossed the famous botanical garden of Montezuma. Near this natural pool a sculpture of a serpent was found, an animal, as we have seen, associated with water and fertility. Hernan Cortes in 1521 writing about Huastepec mentioned this river: Guastepeque ... it was the finest, most pleasant, and largest that ever was seen, having a circumference of two leagues, and a very pretty rivulet with high banks ran along it from one end to the other . .. there were lodgings, arbours and refreshing gardens and an infinite number of different kinds of fruit trees; many herbs and scented flowers. It certainly filled one with admiration to see the grandeur and exquisite beauty of this entire orchard.106 The deities worshipped in Huastepec were Cihualcoatl-Quilazli, Xochiquetzal, Xochipilli- Macuilxochitl, all gods related to fertility, procreation, dancing and singing. Another important god was Matlacxochitl (ten flowers) a kind of goddess of medicine, which confirms the importance of Huastepec as a botanical garden.107 Nezahualcoyotl also laid out his garden on the sacred hill of Tezcotzinco (Figure 18) and used the canalized waters flowing down from the springs of Mount Tlaloc to create ponds with panoramic views from the hillside. The hilltop was defined by a spiralling path reached by rock-cut stairs rising from the probable site of Nezahualcoyotl's villa on the southern slope below. Another path traverses the hill along the east-west axis. There were baths and pools placed at the cardinal points around the circumambulating path. On the summit were 204</page><page sequence="21">CONCEPT OF THE GARDEN IN PRE-HISPANIC MEXICO Figure 7..n..,Re Acuna 985). Nationa Figure I7.

Below, to the east, monumental sculptures were dedicated to agricultural divinities. Other natural shrines in Tezcozinco include a cave at the transition-point between Nezahualcoyotl's residence and the botanical collections on the lower south slope of the hill.108 Thus, the Mesoamericans created gardens on natural sacred places where the work of man in the form of canals, pools, temples, reliefs existed in perfect harmony with natural features such as mountains, caves and springs. This garden was not only a representation of a terrestrial paradise, a Tlalocan-Tamoanchan, but also it was a ritual place where kings and magnates performed rites that linked their people to the sacred forces of the earth and sky that gave them life. However, there is another aspect of the garden that was equally important: its political iconography. On the rocks of the hill at Chapultepec and Huastepec there were reliefs representing the effigies of the king and his ancestors whose function was to remind the population of the royal family accomplish- ments. Montezuma told his brother Tlacaelel: ... Brother, see all the hardships and afflictions that we have endured until today to maintain this republic and how we have expanded and enlarged the Mexican nation by winning many wars. We deserve to be remembered, for this reason I decided that two statues, representing me and you, will be carved in the garden of Chapultepec. There, in stone that stonecutters will consider the best, we will be carved for perpetual memory, as a reward for our work. So that our sons and grandsons seeing our effigies will remember our great accomplishments and strive to imitate us ....109 205</page><page sequence="22">GARDEN HISTORY 29:2 In Huastepec Tezozomoc reports how Montezuma the Elder (Ilhuicamina, 1440-69) had sculpted on the rocks of the garden the effigies of his ancestors: Another day Moctezuma called Cihuacoatl and told him: Tlacaeletzin, I am also informed that there is a very pleasant place in Huastepec, where there are rocks, gardens, springs, flowers and fruit trees. Cihuacoatl Tlacaeleltzin answered to this and said: Sir, it is very well agreed that there [in Huastepec] will be represented the kings, your ancestors ....110 The gardens of Tezcozinco also incorporate the imagery of national history represented by Nezahualcoyotl, fifteenth-century warrior-king and founder-father of the imperial Tetzcocan state. The historical sources describe at the summit of the hill a sculpture Figure i8. Tetzcotzinco. Photo: Michael Calderwood. 206 ........... :a.. . ~ y .,. ..... . ., .: . a... . *i.i ... . .

East Collector. Photo: Michael Calderwood. carved in the stone matrix of the mountainside of a coyote-like figure. In effect, this was the name glyph of Nezahualcoyotl or 'Fasting Coyote'. The king image was represented as a feathered wolf, probably a figure similar to the Aztec sculptures of a plumed coyote or 'coyotl inahual', in Nahuatl.11 Another much more complex sculptural relief described at length by Ixtlilxochitl illustrated key events of the Tezcocan' s ruler life. According to the sources, the reliefs were situated near the first collector of water (east side) on a circular stone sculpted on the rock and they represented the coat of arms of Nezahualcoy- otl (Figure 19). There exists a Tezcoco's coat of arms, awarded to the city by Carlos V in I551, that coincides with the Ixtlilxochitl's description of the reliefs on Tezcozinco.11 This coat of arms refers to Nezahualcoyotl in his warrior role alluding to his conquests and as a poet alluding to his songs and poems, represented by a flower and a drum. War is represented by an arrow and a chimalli (shield) and by water and fire. An arm with a bow and arrow near a hill (tepetl) refers to the altepetl or territory of the chichimeca-alcohua. The arms (acolli) and the lion (miztli) which support the coat of arms form the second name of Nezahualcoyotl 'Acolmiztli' or 'lion arm'.113 Finally, Ixtlilxochitl mentions that facing the north side there were three frogs sculpted on the rock at the border of a pool and they alluded to Tenochitlan, Tetzcoco and Tlacopan; the three allied cities which 207</page><page sequence="24">GARDEN HISTORY 29:2 Figure zo.

The sculptures at Tezcozinco were commissioned by the monarch to remind the population of his historical achievements in the early fifteenth-century wars that established Texcocan independence and built an empire in alliance with Tenochitlan. His personal memorial was an integral part of the sacred gardens of Tezcozinco, thus proving that this garden like the one at Chapultepec and Huastepec served also as political propaganda. CONCLUSION The animistic sacred geography of the Mesoamerican people made them layout their gardens around ritual places such as mountains, springs and caves. Their gardens were sacred places associated with the curing of physical and spiritual ills and conveying the idea of a terrestrial paradise. At the same time they served the king to reinforce his ties with the cosmic forces through the presence of certain animals and plants and to convey certain patriotic and political ideas by means of its architectural iconography. Pre- Hispanic people created paradise-like gardens for worship and contemplation which reflected the harmonic integration between nature and man and where nature continued to have a prominent role. 208</page><page sequence="25">CONCEPT OF THE GARDEN IN PRE-HISPANIC MEXICO REFERENCES 1 An earlier and much abbreviated version of this paper was read at the IIth Annual Afro-Hispanic Literature and Culture Conference, San Jose, Costa Rica, July zooo, and which may appear in the Proceedings of the Conference. 2 Angel Ma.

The high value placed on cacao was based on its function as currency in pre-Conquest exchange systems and on its use as a prestigious beverage and stimulant. Sahagun refers to chocolate as 'the privilege, the drink of nobles, of rulers'; Florentine Codex, bk VI, 256; X, 93. The consumption of chocolate was limited to wealthy upper class, to the elderly or those honoured for their achievements by the state. The cacao bean also has a stimulating effect on the drinker because of the alkaloid theobromine. The effect of the cacao drink as a stimulant is referred to by Sahagun when he writes that the beverage 'makes one dizzy confuses one, . . deranges one'; bk XI, II9-o0. Chocolate was also known as an aphrodisiac: a conviction that prompted its continued cultivation by Spanish settlers and boasted its popularity ratings among sixteenth-century European nobility. 28 Hueynacaztli: this flower dried and grinded together with mecaxochitl and tlilxochitl was put inside the flower yolloxochitl and hung around the neck of travellers as an amulet; Martin de la Cruz, Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis, 8I. It has been suggested that the smell of this plant has hallucinogenic properties; Carlos Viesca Trevifo, 'Los psicotr6picos y la medicina de los gobernantes entre los aztecas', in Estudios sobre Etnobotanica y Antropologia Medica II (Mexico: Instituto Mexicano para el Estudio de las Plantas Medicinales, 1977), 45-58.</page><page sequence="26">GARDEN HISTORY 29:2 29 Yolloxochitl: an important flowering tree known as 'heart flower'. Hernandez mentions that the tree was 'appreciated by the Indians as much for its medicinal uses as for its beauty and the aroma of its flowers'; Hernandez, Historia Natural de la Nueva Espana, bk II, 5. The yolloxochitl was so esteemed by the natives that according to Sahagun's informants the tree was cultivated only for the nobility and its flowers were used in offerings to the most important deities; Florentine Codex, bk IX, 330. Part of yolloxochitl's importance was the physical resemblance of the unopened bud to the human heart, as expressed in its Nahuatl name (yollotli, heart; xochitl, flower). The Aztecs considered the heart the centre of a person's life and spirit and the animating force. The plant's magical powers were manifold. When dried and hollowed out, the yolloxochitl bud was filled with a mixture of other flowers and hung around the neck of the travellers as a protective amulet. It was - and in rural Mexico still is - considered the most efficacius medicine in heart diseases. The plant was also used to expel bad humours from a patient's chest; Martin de la Cruz, Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis, 77. 30 Cacahuaxochitl: in Nahuatl it means 'precious flower' and it is the flower of the cacao tree. Because of its beautiful smell, the flowered branches were much used in ritual ceremonies. 31 Huacalxochitl: in Nahuatl it means 'basket flower' and it was one of the most venerated flowers by the Aztecs. In addition to having medicinal value, the huacalxochitl was one of the most noteworthy ritual accessories in Aztec ceremonies; considered so precious and aromatic that the supreme Aztec ruler Moctezuma II offered the flower at the temple of the Aztec deity Huitzilopochtli. It was also used to decorate military heroes and the 'tlatoiani', i.e. the ruler. The value of huacalxochitl was related to fertility through the sexual symbolism inherent in its blossom; Sahagun, Florentine Codex, bk II, 209; Hernandez, Historia Natural de la Nueva Espana, bk IX, 389. 32 Cacaloxochitl: in Nahuatl it means 'crow- flower'. Hernandez affirmed that it was a flourishing tree mainly used for its beautiful aromatic flowers. He wrote that the natives made garlands with it and the flowered branches of the tree were offered to governors or important people. He also indicated its medicinal use for stomach diseases; Historia Natural de la Nueva Espana, bk IX, 403. Martin de la Cruz, however, prescribes it as a remedy for those people who suffered from a shock; Martin de la Cruz, Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis, 76. 33 Tlilxochitl: in Nahuatl it means 'black flower' and is commonly known as vanilla. The black sheaths of the flower were highly praised for their pleasant smell. It was added to chocolate drink to enhance its taste. Hernandez wrote that it was prescribed to those who spat blood. It was also used to provoke women's menstruations, accelerate their labour and ease the extraction of a dead foetus. It was also a remedy against poisonous animals; Hernandez, Historia Natural de la Nueva Espana, bk III, i6I. 34 Hernando Alvaro Tezoz6moc, Cronica Mexicana [I588] (Mexico: Porrua, I980), 370-I; Fray Diego Duran, Historia de las Indias de Nueva Espana, bk II, 247. 35 Martin de la Cruz, Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis, 57. 36 Fray Diego Duran, Historia de las Indias de Nueva Espana, bk II, 248. 37 The Codex Borgia (Apostolic Library, Vatican, Rome) is one of the most beautiful of the few surviving pre-Colombian painted manuscripts.
