<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> APULEIUS’ METAMORPHOSES AND THE SPURCUM ADDITAMENTUM (10.21) ephraim lytle T he designation spurcum additamentum is the modern and unwar-ranted description of  a much-abbreviated passage in the hand of  Za-nobi da Strada that appears in the margin of  manuscript f of  Apuleius’ Metamorphoses in the Laurentian library.1 Apropos of  the additamentum, Elmenhurst in his edition of  1620 expressed the opinion that decency and decorum should forbid that Apuleius’ work be desecrated by its inclusion. His censoriousness was not, however, enough to prevent his discussing it at considerable length, prompting Oudendorp to ask, “If  Elmenhurst was so pure, why didn’t he rather enshroud the additamentum in silence” (“tam castus si fuit Emenhorstius, cur non potius silentio involvit hoc fragmen- tum”)?2 Since then the additamentum has held an almost irresistible attrac- tion for scholars of  Apuleius, but the majority agree with Hildebrand’s deduction, in his Opera omnia of  1842, that it is not the work of  Apuleius, “qui nefariam turpitudinem in his verborum involucris non tulit.”3 This view prevails today; the additamentum is commonly omitted or, at best, relegated to the apparatus criticus.4 Most of  the arguments against Apuleian authorship, however, are less than compelling and in many of  them one can see moral considerations given greater importance than whatever stylistic features are adduced in their For numerous signficant suggestions and many corrections, I owe Larry Richardson a debt of  gratitude. Likewise, I should thank CP’s anonymous reader for a number of  helpful criticisms. 1. Manuscript f = Laur. 29.2, a twelfth- or thirteenth-century Beneventan MS, and the oldest transcript of  F = Laur. 68.2. For a discussion of  these manuscripts see Lowe 1920 and Robertson 1924, with the ad- ditional comments of  Dowden 1980. For the identification of  the additamentum as in the hand of  Zanobi da Strada, a hand found in the margins not only of  f, but of  F and C as well, see Billanovich 1953, 31–33. The additamentum also appears in the margins of  a later manuscript L1 (Laur. 54.32), where it is also much ab- breviated, but with readings diverging slightly from those found in f (see below, n. 18). Subsequently the additamentum was included in either the margin or the text itself  of  a number of  MSS (Laur. 54.12, Laur. 54.24, and Urb. Vat. 199) derived from L1 or f. 2.

It has dis- appeared entirely from the most recent Loeb edition, Hanson 1989, although in Gaselee’s 1915 Loeb edi- tion, the appendix includes an “Additional note to p. 508” where the additamentum is printed, with the comment, “In spite of  [the lines’] extremely corrupt state, it is not impossible that they should be in part from the original text of  Apuleius.” This trend away from recognizing the possible authenticity of  the ad- ditamentum is likewise evidenced by the additamentum’s omission from every translation except that of van den Broeck 1988.

As a result, the addi- tamentum has been scrutinized separately and its vital position within the matrona scene has never been fully appreciated. In fact, divorcing the ad- ditamentum from the narrative structure of  the Metamorphoses has resulted in the miscomprehension not only of  the additamentum, but of  the entire scene in which it is embedded. The object of  this paper is to remedy this situation by demonstrating that the additamentum preserves a vital gap in a scene that parallels directly the difficult breeding of  an ass with a mare. Columella, in his De re rustica, tells us that every farm requires an ass, that they are necessaria, household fixtures (“quare omne rus tanquam maxime necessarium instrumentum desiderat asellum, qui, ut dixi, pleraque utensilia et vehere in urbem et reportare collo vel dorso commode potest,” 7.1.3). It is my contention that Apuleius firmly roots his narrator in a wealth 5. Hildebrand’s bias is apparent, as is that of  Mariotti (1956, 229), who finds Hildebrand persuasive, “sull’uso non apuleiano dei grecismi e sull’esagerato compiacimento per l’oscenità.” Fraenkel (1953, 153) calls it, among other things, an “unappetizing text.” 6. One exception is Pennisi (1970), whose important and careful study does much to dismantle a number of  arguments against Apuleian authorship. The most recent general discussion of  the additamentum can be found as an appendix to Zimmerman 2000, 433–39, wherein Zimmerman presents a summary of  competing claims. The bibliography is exhaustive although not arranged by subject as is the convenient recent bibli- ography of  Finkelpearl and Schlam 2001, 223. 7. Fraenkel 1953, 153; likewise, Mariotti 1956. See also the views of  Merkelbach (1952) and Mazzarino (1950). Pizzica (1981) concludes that it might not be medieval but can be no earlier than the fourth century c.e. Reasonable philological arguments for the possibility of  Apuleian authorship can be found as early as Oudendorp 1786, and as recently as Herrmann 1951 and Pennisi 1970. 8. Fraenkel 1953, 154. Zimmerman (2000, 439), following Mariotti, concludes, somewhat inexplicably given the admitted ambiguities in the various arguments she presents, that “there is no doubt about the me- dieval origin of  the spurcum additamentum.” 9.

Much of  this behavioral detail is lost on modern audi- ences, which has led to misinterpretations that are compounded by Lucius’ tendency to provide misleading or ironic narration. Stated simply, Lucius insists on anthropomorphizing his predicaments, rationalizing his own be- havior as an ass in ways that do not quite coincide with the detail provided and what Apuleius’ audience already knows about asses. Apuleius, on the other hand, wishes his audience to visualize a narrative reality that is radi- cally different from Lucius’ eccentric viewpoint. Furthermore, this disjunction between narration and underlying narrative is progressive, reaching its climax in the tenth book, a book that is, as many scholars have noted, pivotal in numerous regards.10 By briefly tracing the development of  this narrative strategy, once we turn to Lucius’ coupling with the matrona we will be able to distinguish clearly between Lucius’ ironic narration and the underlying analogy from the breeding barn. After Lucius’ transformation, Apuleius immediately begins actively to call his narrator into question.11 Shortly after his transformation, Lucius retires to the stable only to be kicked at by his own horse, an encounter he frames in ridiculously anthropomorphic terms. His horse, rather than “registering some recognition and compassion” and offering “hospitality and a fair lodg- ing,” instead “conspires” with Milo’s ass as they “plot his destruction.”12 Apuleius’ narrator couches the entire incident in terms of  hospitium et fides, whereas the image of  an alien ass being led into a stable, and the ensuing behavior of  the other quadrupeds, would have been familiar and common- place to nearly every ancient. Apuleius confirms many of  our suspicions about Lucius shortly hereafter as he is being led away by bandits. Planning to fake utter exhaustion, Lu- cius is horrified to discover that before he can act another ass collapses and is unable to rise. The robbers cut its hamstrings and fling off  the corpse. Lu- cius interprets the scene, once again, in ridiculously anthropomorphic terms. According to Lucius-the-conspiracy-theorist, the other ass has guessed at his own intentions and then pre-empted them by attempting the scheme that 10. For a basic overview see the introduction to Zimmerman 2000 (18–25, “Themes in the Metamor- phoses and Their Incorporation in Book 10”). 11. Zimmerman (2000, 21) writes that, “From the metamorphosis (3,24) onward, the narrator repeatedly emphasizes that although Lucius has the body of  an ass and is an ordinary ass in the eyes of  other actors in the story, he nevertheless remains human inside.” In fact, after his transformation, Lucius, as we shall see, never asserts his essential humanity in an unambiguous way. He only calls attention to his humanity in the context of  questioning it. That Lucius’ narration is not entirely reliable has been noted by numerous schol- ars but not in the context of  relating his narration to the underlying behavioral description found in scenes such as that with the matrona. 12. This passage is worth quoting at length (3.26): “atque ego rebar, si quod inesset mutis animalibus tacitum ac naturale sacramentum, agnitione ac miseratione quadam inductum equum illum meum hospi- tium ac loca lautia mihi praebiturum. sed pro Iuppiter hospitalis et Fidei secreta numina! praeclarus ille vector meus cum asino capita conferunt in meamque perniciem” (“I assumed that if  among the mute beasts some silent and natural accord existed, then certainly my own horse, recognizing and pitying me, would at least offer me hospitality and a fair lodging. But no, by God, by Juppiter Hospitalis and by all the hidden powers of  loyalty, my own noble horse instead conspired with that ass to plot my destruction”). </page> <page sequence="4"> 352 Ephraim Lytle he himself  devised.13 We have, very early on, considerable doubts about the reliability of  our narrator. Apuleius, in case any of  his readers is missing the point, himself  articu- lates it as Lucius’ unreliability increases, placing such phrases in his narra- tor’s mouth as, “This familiarity became clear to me, even though I was an ass” (“quamvis asino sentire praestabant,” 4.1), and shortly thereafter, “If indeed my praecordia was not altogether ass-like” (“iamque apud mea non usquequaque ferina praecordia,” 4.2). At one point Lucius directly addresses the reader, “I ask that you measure very carefully whether I was an ass in intelligence and feeling as well as in body” (“faxo vos quoque, an mente etiam sensuque fuerim asinus, sedulo sentiatis,” 4.6). At another point Lu- cius describes himself  eating his fodder as if  he were an ass (“in asini fa- ciem,” 3.29), the implication being that he really is not an ass, but shortly thereafter he describes himself  feeling almost as if  he were no longer an ass (“ut hercle ipse sentirem non asinum me,” 4.2), the implication being that he really is an ass. Likewise, he describes himself  as having a donkey’s sense of  decency (“verecundia asinalia,” 4.23). He even questions openly his own logic, asserting, “This is certainly an idiotic deliberation, entirely ass- inine” (“haec quidem inepta et prorsus asinina cogitatio,” 6.26). And finally, Lucius tells us outright, late in the narrative, that when he was disguised in an ass’s skin he had been, in fact, less intelligent (“etsi minus prudentem, multiscium reddidit,” 9.13). Once we recognize that Lucius is very much an ordinary ass, the disjunc- tion between narrative and narration is hard to miss, and whole scenes un- fold before us, seen in an entirely new light. As an example, we can turn briefly to Lucius’ treatment of  his flight with Charite. Lucius tells us that Charite wrestled the reins free from the old lady and then “she mounted me, having called me back from flight with gentle whispers” (“extorto etenim loro manibus eius me placidis gannitibus ab impetu revocatum naviter in- scendit,” 6.27). The behavioral imagery is perfectly clear: Lucius the dumb, frightened ass with Charite calming him lest he bolt. Then they begin their escape, which Lucius describes as follows (6.28): ego simul voluntariae fugae voto et liberandae virginis studio, sed et plagarum suasu, quae me saepicule commonebant . . . virgini delicatas voculas adhinnare temptabam. sed et scabendi dorsi mei simulatione non numquam obliquata cervice pedes decoros puel- lae basiabam. The desire to escape and my eagerness to free the girl were reinforced by the blows she frequently gave me as an admonishment of  our plight. . . . I tried to neigh soothing words to the girl, and, while pretending to scratch my back, I kept bending around and kissing her delicate feet. 13. Lucius’ narration is comically absurd: “sed tam bellum consilium meum praevertit sors deterrima. namque ille alius asinus divinato et antecapto meo cogitatu statim se mentita lassitudine cum rebus totis offudit iacensque in modum mortui fustibus, non stimulis ac ne cauda et auribus cruribusque undique ver- sum elevatis temptavit exsurgere” (“But evil fortune thwarted so fine a plan, since that other ass, somehow catching wind of  my scheme and undertaking it himself, feigned exhaustion by collapsing to the ground as if  he were dead. Nor, despite their beating and goading him, would he rise up again, even though they tugged at his tail and legs and ears”). </page> <page sequence="5"> Apuleius’ Metamorphoses 353 Here we have nearly all the previously described elements of  Lucius’ nar- rative. The imagery is clear: Charite goading on an ass by slapping its flanks, with the ass occasionally twisting around its head, attempting to rub its bridle, perhaps brushing Charite’s feet in the process. Here Lucius’ misguided narration is not only amusing, but it also works to sustain an awareness of  his percolating sexuality, which constitutes a major element in the narrative strategy that achieves fruition in the scene with the matrona. Immediately after his transformation we are hardly sur- prised when Lucius describes his newly enlarged member as the only solace in an otherwise humiliating transformation, although he cannot, in his present form, embrace Fotis (“nec ullum miserae reformationis video sola- cium, nisi quod mihi iam nequeunti tenere Fotidem natura crescebat,” 3.24). Likewise, by lamenting his inability to have sex with Fotis, Lucius is fore- shadowing an eventual bestial union. At the same time, Apuleius introduces the idea that humans might find Lucius as sexually desirable as he finds women. Shortly after being sold to the catamite, he is brought home and the very real possibility of  bestiality arises, the possibility of  a bestial orgy, no less. When a servant, whom the priests use as a sex slave, spies Lucius, he states, “At last you have come as a relief  for my wretched labor . . . you shall be a boon to my masters, and to my spent loins as well” (“venisti tandem miserrimi laboris vicarius . . . dominis placeas et meis defectis iam lateribus,” 8.26). As if  Apuleius’ frequently reminding us of  his narrator’s endowment, and the bestial potential contained therein, were not enough, he is also careful to demonstrate that his narrator has every intention of  using his newly ac- quired goods, although the objects of  Lucius’ desire, as he becomes less and less human, cease to be limited to his former species. Lucius is no sooner set loose in a field with other horses than he begins to “note which mares might make the best bed mates” (“equas opportunissimas iam mihi concubi- nas futuras deligebam,” 7.16). He is frustrated in this pursuit, as one might expect in a narrative whose climax in the tenth book depends upon Lucius’ long-delayed conquest. It is only shortly after he is thwarted in the pastures that Lucius finds him- self  in the temporary custody of  a sadistic youth. After a series of  ambiguous mishaps, this youth returns home and maliciously concocts, or so Lucius claims, a graphic account in which Lucius, “far too much an ass” (nimis asi- num), has been sexually assaulting various women and boys, “attempting illicit and unspeakable acts, aspiring to fulfill his bestial desires in an un- holy union” (“illicitas atque incognitas temptat libidines, et ferinas volup- tates aversa Venere invitat ad nuptias,” 7.21). The scene, as soon as it is presented by the youth, exists for us as a set of  images and, having learned to question Lucius, we are left wondering only how much of  it might be true. The scene is a wonderful example of  the way in which narrative de- vices rarely arise independently of  one another, and here we witness the co- existence of  a number of  distinctly Apuleian narrative strategies: graphic detail, an unreliable narrator, and a pervasive sexual subtext. In the Meta- morphoses, multiple suggestions and overtones often converge in a single </page> <page sequence="6"> 354 Ephraim Lytle scene, even a single sentence, with a distinctly Apuleian harmony. Nowhere is this harmony more evident than in Metamorphoses 10.20–22 and the additamentum. Metamorphoses 10.20–22 and the additamentum present an episode that has been generally misinterpreted, perhaps because much of  the imagery re- quires a familiarity with donkeys that is beyond the reach of  the average reader today. A coupling between Lucius and the matrona has been arranged well in advance. The donkey, we are told, has been fed wine, and he is then led into a carefully prepared chamber: dii boni, how royally things are pre- pared, with Tyrian dyed cushions and gold coverlets. The matrona then di- vests herself  of  her clothes, perfumes her nude body in his sight with oleo balsamo, and anoints Lucius’s body likewise, giving particular attention to his nostrils. The Latin is emphatic: de stagno vasculo multo sese perungit oleo balsamo meque indidem largissime perfri- cat, sed multo tanto impensius cura etiam nares perfundit meas. She perfumed herself  liberally with balsam oil from a tin jar and likewise generously rubbed me down with it, although she concentrated chiefly on applying it copiously to my nostrils. This emphasis is by no means casual, as we soon discover, and the way in which editors have attempted to alter the text from the reading clearly attested in F is indicative of  the degree to which the entire episode has been mis- understood.14 Here, it is noted in the margin of  our manuscript, should be inserted the additamentum, in which the woman cleans his groin and then manually stimulates him. If  we omit this and stick to the accepted text, hereafter we read (10.21): tunc exosculata pressule, non qualia in lupanari solent basiola iactari vel meretricum poscinummia vel adventorum negantinummia, sed pura atque sincera instruit et blan- dissimos adfatus: “amo” et “cupio” et “te solum diligo” et “sine te iam vivere nequeo” et cetera, quis mulieres et alios inducunt et suas testantur adfectationes. She kissed me, not as they are accustomed to do in the bordellos and professional estab- lishments, coaxing for money, but purely, sincerely, with these and like loving words, “You whom I love,” “My sole desire,” “I cannot live without you,” and whatever other words women use to declare their passionate emotion. Here again Apuleius inserts a marker, in case we are not yet clearly visual- izing the narrative reality, by having his narrator remind us of  the crucial importance of  the wine and the ointment in what would otherwise be an im- possible coupling (10.21): nam et vino pulcherrimo atque copioso memet madefeceram et unguento fraglantissimo prolubium libidinis sucitaram. 14. For example, Hanson, in his 1989 edition, by adopting Wiman’s conjecture, does irreparable harm to the sense of  the passage, making it to read: “. . . meque indidem largissime perfricat, sed multo tanta impen- sius; tura etiam nares perfundit meas.” Likewise, numerous editors have proposed simply deleting cura, which strikes them as unnecessarily emphatic; see Zimmerman (2000, 275), who rightly defends the MS reading, concluding, however, that the emphasis is “a subtle hint that the smelly ass needs much more perfume than the lady.” </page> <page sequence="7"> Apuleius’ Metamorphoses 355 Indeed I had soaked myself  with copious amounts of  fine wine and stirred my appetite for sex with that most odoriferous ointment. The matrona, having sufficiently aroused Lucius, whispers more blandish- ments, and proceeds to engage him in sex. Lucius then offers a careful, if  ill- timed, explanation of  his concern for the matrona’s safety (10.22): artissime namque complexa totum me prorsus, sed totum recepit. illa vero quotiens ei parcens nates recellebam, accedens totiens nisu rabido et spinam prehendens meam ad- plicitiore nexu inhaerebat, ut hercules etiam deesse mihi aliquid ad supplendam eius libidinem crederem nec Minotauri matrem frustra delectatam putarem adultero mugiente. Indeed, clasping me tightly she took in every inch of  me. In fact, each time I tried to spare her and pull back my haunches she would push closer, gripping my spine and clinging in an even tighter embrace, until, by Hercules, I believed I would be insufficient to grat- ify her, and I understood how it was that the mother of  the Minotaur found pleasure in her bovine lover. We know to be wary of  Lucius, but what is the reader meant to understand and visualize here? The scene is based upon the breeding of  quadrupeds, more particularly donkeys with mares, but with the obvious necessary substitutions made for a narrative in which Lucius’ partner is, in fact, a woman who is taking both the role of  the mare and the role of  the “handler” or “steerer,” in breeding barn parlance, as she leads Lucius, the donkey, into a union for which he is physiologically incapable of  arousing himself. Overlaid on this reality we have a typically outrageous narration by Lucius, couched in the vocabulary of  romantic love.15 Lucius has been led into a carefully prepared environment, not unlike a breeding stall. Varro, in his De re rustica, asserting that the mating of  horses is similar to that of  an ass and a mare (2.8.4), observes (2.7.8): si fastidium saliendi est, scillae medium conterunt cum aqua ad mellis crassitudinem; tum ea re naturam equae, cum menses ferunt, tangunt; contra ab locis equae nares equi tangunt. If  the horse will not mount the mare, the core of  the bulb of  a squill is crushed in water until the solution has the consistency of  honey. With this solution the genitalia of  the mare is rubbed when she is in heat, and the nostrils of  the horse are then anointed with the secretions from the genitalia of  the mare. The use of  squill bulbs, from the plant Scilla maritima or Urginea maritima, as a stimulant and expectorant is attested throughout antiquity. The plant is found near the coast throughout the Mediterranean and its medicinal 15. Scholarly misinterpretations of  this scene have often shown either a moral prudery foreign to Apu- leius or else a failure to understand the distinction between Lucius’ narration and what Apuleius wishes his audience to visualize. For instance, Finkelpearl (1998, 155), neglecting to comprehend the absurdity of  Lu- cius’ speech, describes this difficult breeding as “the most touching and tender scene between members of the opposite sex. . . . Our shock may be mediated, too, by the realization that Lucius is not actually a beast.” </page> <page sequence="8"> 356 Ephraim Lytle properties, which are still exploited today, were familiar to the earliest Greek medical writers.16 Columella adds that a sponge may be used to scent the nostrils of  an ass with the genital secretions of  a jenny to encourage the ass to mate with a mare (6.27.10). He also describes another method in which an ass is aroused by a donkey in heat, which is then switched for a mare once the ass is aroused (5.26.4). Obviously, the role of  olfactory stimulation, by means of the genital secretions of  a female of  like species, in the breeding of  quad- rupeds would have been familiar to much, perhaps most, of  Apuleius’ audi- ence. The degree to which ancient estate owners undertook seriously and scientifically such breeding can be seen not only in the many methods de- scribed by the agricultural writers, but also in a highly specialized breeding stall that Columella describes, a stall that he tells us rustici call a machina, which has a ramped floor designed to improve the angle of  penetration for the donkey, thereby increasing the chances of  insemination (6.37.10). Vital to every successful breeding is the role of  the handler, whom Varro tells us is needed to aid the donkey in mounting the mare (“itemque ut ineat equas per origas curamus,” 2.8.4). But ancient agricultural writers felt no pressing need to describe with Apuleian detail how the handler performed his job. This is hardly surprising considering that the specialized knowledge of  handlers, who may well have been slaves owned by the landowners for whom Columella and Varro wrote, lies outside the scope of  such literature. That such a distinction existed between classes is clear from the abundant references in the agricultural writers to the particularized knowledge and vo- cabulary of  the rustici. On the other hand, the modern breeding barn provides excellent parallels, wherein the handler is responsible for washing as well as both manually arousing and guiding the male in order, once again, to en- sure a successful coupling. Likewise, we find the following in Varro (2.7.8): admittere oportet, cum tempus anni venerit, bis die, mane et vespere, per origam; sic appellatur quiqui admittit. eo, enim adiutante, equa alligata, celerius admittuntur, neque equi frustra cupiditate impulsi semen eiciunt. When the proper time arrives, the stallion should be admitted twice daily, in the morn- ing and evening, by the handler, as the man who attends to the mating is called. Indeed, with this man’s assistance, once the mare is restrained, they are bred more swiftly, and the males do not, in the heat of  passion, eject their semen in vain. Clearly the handler’s role involves the physical manipulation of  the male’s member, and celerius admittuntur is simply a summary of  the handler’s role. Keeping all of  this in mind, it is hardly surprising, accustomed as we are to the unreliability of  Apuleius’ narrator, that we should discover beneath 16. References in ancient writers are abundant, e.g., in Latin, Pliny (HN 19.93, 20.97); Varro (Rust. 1.7.7); Vergil (G. 6.3.451). In Greek, references are found to skillhv throughout the Hippocratic corpus and in Aristotle (Hist. an. 556b4), Theophrastus (Hist. pl. 7.9.4 and Char. 16.14), and Dioscorides Medi- cus (7.171), to name but a few. Pliny tells us that Pythagoras, in addition to inventing the oxymel of  squill, wrote an entire book on the subject of  the squill and its medicinal properties. </page> <page sequence="9"> Apuleius’ Metamorphoses 357 Lucius’ narration an ass in every way typical.17 He is led into the matrona’s chamber, after, we are told, he has been fed with wine, although Lucius, true to his anthropomorphic habit, conflates the wine he has been given with the aphrodisiac effects of  the ointment applied to his nostrils, whereas we learn from Pliny that it was commonly held in antiquity that the unruliness of  a mule, and we can presume an ass as well, could be inhibited by frequent draughts of  wine (“mulae calcitratus inhibetur vini crebriore potu,” HN 8.69.173). The matrona, performing the functions of  a handler, is careful to cover both herself  and, most importantly, Lucius’ nostrils, with the collected secretions of  a jenny. She then speaks gently to him, as one might to soothe any quadruped, and for which we have already witnessed a parallel instance in the scene where he flees with Charite, an encounter which Lucius simi- larly misconstrues as romantic. The matrona then proceeds to steer him into an intercourse from which Lucius, as an ass, is predisposed to recoil. This is precisely what Lucius-the-ass attempts to do, trying to pull back his haunches, while Lucius-the-narrator overlays the entire scene with his own riotous alter-reality. From what we know of  the breeding barn, two important steps have been omitted from the commonly accepted text: first, the washing of  the genitalia of  male and female to encourage healthy insemination and, second, the active participation of  the handler in arousing and guiding the male. But if we turn to the additamentum we discover precisely what is absent from the accepted text: et, Hercule, orchium pygam perteretem hyacinthi fragrantis et Chiae rosaceae lotioni- bus expurgavit [expiavit]. dein, digitis, hypate lichanos mese paramese et nete, hastam mihi inguinis nivei spurci&lt;ti&gt;ei pluscule excorians emundavit. et cum ad inguinis cepha- lum formosa mulier conatim veniebat ab orchibus, ganniens ego et dentes ad iovem elevans, priapo, frequenti frictura porrixabam, ipsoque pando et repando ventrem sae- piuscule tractabam [tactabam]. ipsa quoque inspiciens quod genius inter anth. teneras excreverat, modicum morulae qua lustrum sterni mandaverat anni sibi revolutionem autumabat. And, by Hercules, she cleaned the hairless base of  my balls with washes of  fragrant hyacinth and Chiote roses. Then with her fingers—do re mi fa sol!—she cleaned for me 17. More specifically, he is a typical breeding ass. Perhaps our earliest reference in Greek to the particular husbandry of  a breeding ass occurs in a fragment of  Archilochus: hJ dev o¥ savqh / wßst’ oßnou PrihnevvwÍ / khvl- wnoÍ ejplhvmuren ojtrughfavgou (“His cock swelled like that of  a grain-fed, Prienian breeding ass”). This frag- ment (West, 1989, 43) is quoted by Eustathius (1597.28) in his commentary on the Odyssey, where he tells us that early writers attest that khvlwn is derived from asses kept specifically for breeding (oa fasin wÒÍ khvlwn me;n pepoÇhtai a ̊po; tΩn ojceutΩn oßnwn). This Archaic fragment captures the early history of  a specialized hus- bandry that, having migrated across empires and languages, survives relatively unchanged in Apuleius, wherein we discover a striking echo. Shortly before being sold to Thiasus, a wealthy Corinithian, Lucius, whose imagined malnourishment has occupied a considerable portion of  the narrative, suddenly finds himself owned by a cook and a baker, upon whose wares he fattens himself  daily. He describes his subsequent trans- formation (10.15): “interea liberalibus cenis inescatus et humanis adfatim cibis saginatus, corpus obesa pin- guitie compleveram, corium arvina succulenta molliveram, pilum liberali nitore nutriveram” (“Meanwhile, by feasting on abundant meals and stuffing myself  with human food, I had managed to pad my frame with a thick layer of  fat and soften my hide with a rich sheen, while nourishing my pilum with a generous splen- dor”). The pun on pilum is hard to ignore. Having been discovered gorging himself  thus, Lucius is sold to Thiasus who, we are told, continues to provide a similarly rich diet, behavior that Lucius confuses with gen- erosity, since it later becomes clear that Thiasus has every intention of  turning Lucius into a breeding ass. </page> <page sequence="10"> 358 Ephraim Lytle the shaft of  my snow-white groin, scouring away much filth. And when this lovely woman was coming up from my balls to the head of  my cock in her efforts, whinnying and lifting my teeth heavenward, I swelled with a hard-on from the constant rubbing and, with it growing out, and out some more, I caressed my belly with it repeatedly. Seeing what a member had grown in the midst of  such sweet flowers, the modicum of delay in which she had instructed that the breeding stall be made ready seemed to her to have lasted as long as a year.18 Lucius’ washing is demanded not only by the parallel from the breeding barn, but also by the underlying framework of  the narrative, where generous de- scriptions of  Lucius’ filth are a conspicuous element in the abundant detail Apuleius has already provided. At one point, Lucius relates (4.3): at illi canibus iam aegre cohibitis adreptum me loro quam valido ad ansulam quandam destinatum rursum caedendo confecissent profecto, nisi dolore plagarum alvus artata crudisque illis oleribus abundans et lubrico fluxu saucia fimo fistulatim excusso quos- dam extremi liquoris aspergine, alios putore nidoris faetidi a meis iam quassis scapulis abegisset. And those men, having restrained with difficulty their dogs, tied me to a post with a thick rope and then flogged me nearly to death, and would have certainly done me in for good had not my belly, swollen with raw vegetables and abundant blows, been stricken with diarrhea that shot out in a jet, driving them from my abused haunches with the stench of  the reeking gas, and with the spray of  the disgusting fluid. A similar and equally foul scene unfolds later (7.28), while passing refer- ences to Lucius’ filth occur repeatedly throughout the story. The notion that Apuleius, having gone out of  his way to stress the filth of  his narrator-ass, would then couple the matrona with such a disgusting beast fails to recog- nize his concern with aesthetics. That the vocabulary describing the lustration contained in the additamen- tum is ancient and reflects real usage in ancient breeding barns is immedi- ately evident from the following passage in Columella, describing the steps that should be taken to ensure a hen’s successful production of  eggs (8.5.11): supponendi autem consuetudo tradita est ab iis, qui religiosius haec administrant, eius- modi. primum quam secretissima cubilia legunt, ne incubantes matrices ab aliis avibus inquietentur: deinde antequam consternant ea, diligenter emundant, paleasque, quas substraturi sunt, sulfure et bitumine atque ardente teda perlustrant, et expiatas cubilibus iniciunt. The following is the customary method of  preparation for those who are most zealous in the husbandry of  such matters: first they choose nesting boxes that are tucked away, in order that the brooding hens are not disturbed by other birds; then, before they strew hay in them, they cleanse the boxes carefully, and, with bitumine and sulfur, they purify the hay that will be placed under the hens, and once the hay has been purged they strew it in the nesting boxes. 18. This translation is tentative and it should be noted that the additamentum, as it appears in the margins of  the manuscripts, is abbreviated and possibly corrupt, although its rendering is not difficult and could pos- sibly be improved if  scholars were not so quick to assume the passage’s spuriousness. The version of  the text that I have produced relies on the transcription of  Helm 1931, 252–53, as well as the editions of  Hil- denbrand 1842, 930 and Pennisi 1970, 131. Pennisi also includes a useful history of  proposed emendations (132–33). </page> <page sequence="11"> Apuleius’ Metamorphoses 359 The parallels in language between this passage and the additamentum are remarkable. Even more remarkable is that these parallels exist despite the great differences in the process of  purification used in the husbandry of  spe- cies as diverse as chickens and donkeys. Given the careful attention to clean- liness observed here, it is inconceivable that the breeding of  quadrupeds would not include cleansing. So it is hardly surprising that we discover a careful cleansing in the additamentum. Furthermore, the way in which the sensory details of  that cleansing are described is distinctly Apuleian, per- teretem pygam describing perfectly the smooth and hairless area around the genitalia of  an ass, especially when coupled with its appropriate color im- age, inguinis nivei. There follows, “dein digitis, hypate lichanos mese paramese et nete, has- tam . . . emundavit” (“She purged the shaft with her fingers, hypate, licha- nos, mese, paramese, et nete”). This sequence of  the strings of  a lyre has been much discussed and as much misunderstood. Fraenkel pounces on this detail in order to attribute the additamentum to an imagined medieval scribe whom he calls “Spurcus,” who found these string names in Boethius’ De in- stitutione musica, an explanation that Mariotti and others have accepted. According to Fraenkel, Spurcus intended to perpetrate a hoax by pretending these string names were the names in Greek for the fingers, but gave himself away for, “Had he been possessed of  even an elementary knowledge of Greek, he would have noticed that the fingers in Greek as well as in Latin are masculine.”19 Spurcus is a straw man, and this is precisely the kind of misrepresentation that has hindered a reasonable reevaluation of  the addi- tamentum.20 First, the strings are not always presented in that order in Boe- thius’ work. Nor do they occur anywhere as a simple list, but in a discussion spread across eight chapters (1.12–20). Second, there is no reason at all these names must come from Boethius. They are introduced in Vitruvius and explained as referring not only to the strings but to the corresponding notes of  the scale (De arch. 5.3–9). Furthermore, examined within the context of  the narrative, it is clear that Apuleius is not naming the fingers at all but simply sounding the names of notes that correspond to each of  the fingers as the matrona employs them around Lucius’ member. The first, hypate, corresponds to the lowest pitch, lichanos to one slightly higher, and so on. Lucius is singing a rising scale, perhaps as familiar to every ancient as do re mi is to us, but it corresponds to the rising of  his sexual pitch, exactly the kind of  comical narration we have come to expect.21 Finally, although the preponderance of  Greek in the additamentum has been held up as a chief  proof  of  its spuriousness, Vitruvius 19. Fraenkel 1953, 153. 20. For example, Zimmerman (2000, 438) asserts that Fraenkel “provided convincing proof  that for the curious enumeration of  the fingers in par. 2, which has nothing to do with the Greek names for fingers (except licanos), ‘Spurcus’ was inspired by a passage from Boethius’ De institutione musica.” 21. It is not surprising to discover that such a natural reading has presented itself  independently to other acute readers. Pennisi (1970, 255) writes, “Un altro cardine dei ‘negatori’ erano i ‘nomi della dita’, hypate, lichanos etc., che sono in realtà nomi di corda della lira. Anche qui i termini, usati con senso in situazione erotico-sessuale hanno trovato la loro interpretazione con riferimento alla ‘melodia’ che la mano della donna suscita con l’atto della frictura sui sensi dell’asino-uomo.” </page> <page sequence="12"> 360 Ephraim Lytle tells us that the reason these terms are used by the Romans is because there are no Latin equivalents for certain theoretical musical terms (“quam si vo- lumus explicare, necesse est etiam graecis verbis uti, quod nonnullae eorum latinas non habent appellationes,” 5.1).22 With regard to the Greek vocabu- lary, Lawrence Richardson writes: I find only the following: orchium, pygam, cephalum, orchibus, priapo, anth. Of  these none except the last is at all difficult or uncommon, and the reading of  the last is ques- tionable. . . . There might be a medical coloring . . . but I really suspect that this was more like our use of  French words.23 This interpretation is certainly correct, as one finds in Celsus an assertion that not only confirms Richardson’s suspicion, but refutes any notion that the language in the additamentum is inappropriate or uncharacteristic of Apuleius (Med. 6.18.1): proxima sunt ea, quae ad partes obscenas pertinent, quarum apud Graecos vocabula et tolerabilius se habent et accepta iam usu sunt, cum in omni fere medicorum volumine atque sermone iactentur: apud nos foediora verba ne consuetudine quidem aliqua vere- cundius loquentium commendata sunt, ut difficilior haec explanatio sit simul et pudo- rem et artis praecepta servantibus. Next are those subjects related to the genitalia, for which the Greek terms are more tol- erable and are generally used, while at the same time they are found in nearly every med- ical book and treatise. Nor are our crass words appropriate, even in common use, for any modest speaker, and thus it is far more difficult to relate these matters while observing both decency and the requirements of  the art. Despite Adams’ assertion that in antiquity Greek sexual terms were not reg- ularly imported into Latin, Celsus’ meaning should be clear even to those of us not trained in hermeneutics.24 It was clearly considered in poor taste, at least among educated speakers, to use vulgar Latin terms rather than the more polite Greek ones.25 Celsus, however, is intent on avoiding these Greek terms because, like many Roman writers using source material originally written in Greek, he is using Latin programmatically. To write his medical treatise in Latin is half  the point of  writing it at all. Apuleius, on the other hand, and in marked contrast to the majority of  Latin writers, is beholden to no such program. Lucius uses those terms that occur most naturally to an educated speaker like himself, and an educated speaker, as Celsus states outright, would prefer to use Greek. 22. Regarding the excessive use of  Greek, see Hildebrand 1842, 930–35; Fraenkel 1953, p. 154, n. 1. 23. Richardson 2001. 24. Adams (1982, 228–30), with regards to the Greek sexual vocabulary, begs the question. Adams’ asser- tion that Greek sexual terms, like those we find in the additamentum, are not commonly found in Latin authors, and that this proves the passage’s spuriousness, ignores the likelihood that many Latin speakers were, like Apuleius, very familiar with Greek sexual terms, and their failure to employ them in formal writing speaks only to their adherence to, and Apuleius’ radical departure from, Latin literary forms. 25. The general circulation of  Greek sexual terms as reflected in the additamentum argues against the following theory found in Zimmerman 2000, 439: “The author of  the additamentum shows a remarkable knowledge of  anatomy and medical technical terms, as appears from several of  Mariotti’s notes. This may suggest that he was one of  the eruditi who shared in the heyday of  renewed medical studies.” In fact, both Mariotti and Zimmerman rely in their translations of  the additamentum on the overly technical application of  terms intended to be idiomatically sexual rather than medical. </page> <page sequence="13"> Apuleius’ Metamorphoses 361 Furthermore, Apuleius’ employment in the additamentum of  borrowings from Greek is not radically different from his usage elsewhere in the Meta- morphoses. Giuseppe Pennisi’s important study not only collects a number of  Apuleian coinages from Greek that are either elsewhere unattested or not earlier attested, but also demonstrates that there are a number of  other pas- sages in the Metamorphoses “in which the author has purposefully con- centrated and clustered together a series of  grecisms” (“in cui l’autore ha, per così dire, volutamente raggruppato e condensato tutta una serie di gre- cismi”), either in a single relatively short list (e.g., “oculis obunctis graphice prodeunt, mitellis et crocotis et carbasinis et bombycinis iniecti,” 8.24, or “me phaleris aureis et fucatis ephippiis et purpureis tapetis et frenis ar- genteis et pictilibus balteis,” 10.18) or spread throughout longer passages such as at 11.16 or 10.30–31.26 In fact, Apuleius’ use of  terms borrowed from Greek in the additamen- tum, rather than arguing against its authenticity, provides a possible ex- planation for its failure to be transmitted in F or its archetype.27 That the additamentum otherwise reflects peculiarities of  style and vocabulary that are distinctly Apuleian can hardly be denied. Indeed, the passage’s authen- ticity has been questioned repeatedly despite bearing the immediately recog- nizable stamp of  genium Apuleianum. But, as we have seen, these arguments are often based on generalizations that are easily dispelled by a careful eval- uation of  Apuleius’ text. Likewise, the absence of  the additamentum in Lu- cian’s Greek version is still widely regarded as serious evidence against the passage’s authenticity, an argument that is at least as old as Oudendorp, about whom Hildenbrand writes: Oud. ipsi, quamquam spurcissimum illud fragmentum genium Apuleianum satis spirare videatur, valde tamen suspectum est, potissimum quum in Luciano nullum eius extet vestigium. Although this most foul fragment seemed to him to breathe with the spirit of  Apulieus, Oudendorp himself  was nevertheless suspicious of  its authenticity, chiefly because no trace of  it remains in Lucian.28 Pennisi’s careful comparison of  the Greek and Latin versions does much, however, to undermine this argument against authenticity and provides nu- merous parallel examples that clearly contradict the still current claim that “in other respects the text of  this episode in the Onos parallels Apuleius’ 26. See Pennisi 1970, 209–13. Zimmerman (2000, 437), citing Pennisi’s study, concedes that “the pres- ence of  many grecisms in this fragment is in itself  not a decisive argument against its authenticity.” 27. The manuscript readings in F are, judging by the number of  proposed emendations, most unreliable precisely in those passages that employ abundant borrowings from Greek. In fact, F’s reading for the Greek at 11.17 (variously emended, e.g., to ploiafevsia by Mommsen or aÒgÇa ∆EfesÇa by Baehrens) is hopelessly corrupt, demonstrating the peculiar difficulties posed by Apuleius’ texts, which reflect the essentially bilin- gual character of  the Second Sophistic. One can imagine a context as early as the fourth century wherein the idiomatic employment of  Greek found in the additamentum could have been lost on an editor, resulting in the subsequent omission of  the passage. Pennisi (1970, 239–52) argues that F descends from a fourth- century Sallustii recensio, which, unlike the independently transmitted codex available to Zanobi da Strada, omitted the additamentum. On the question of  Apuleius’ transmission, particularly the important role of Montecassino, see Pecere 1987. 28. Hildebrand 1842, 931. </page> <page sequence="14"> 362 Ephraim Lytle version completely.”29 And, while it has not been the object of  this paper to carefully compare the very different narrative strategies of  the two authors, I should point out that in each of  the parallel scenes previously cited, Lu- cian’s Greek version lacked each of  the key elements present in Apuleius’ account.30 In fact, the presence or absence of  the passage in the Greek version is a red herring, and the only genuine consideration should be the content of  the additamentum itself  and its relationship to the rest of  Apuleius’ text. As we have seen, the lustration contained therein is practically demanded by the underlying narrative. What remains to consider is the role of  the matrona as a handler actively arousing Lucius. Mule breeding would have required not only the washing but also the manual stimulation of  the male, precisely as we witness it here. The image of  Lucius drawing up his belly and thrusting out with his phallus describes precisely the state of  arousal sought by the handler. Varro relates an anecdote in which a handler forces a horse to mount the mare and the frenzied horse bites the handler (2.7.9). Columella similarly informs us that sometimes an ass, while mounting, will bite the back and neck of  a mare (“cum admittitur, cervicibus dorsisque feminarum imprimit morsus,” 5.37), and it is for pre- cisely this reason that a leather shield was commonly draped across the withers of  the mare, or over the head of  the ass. The image, then, of  Lucius- the-ass rolling back his lips and baring his teeth while drawing up his belly is plain, though he presents it in the extravagant terms we might expect from him: “ganniens ego et dentes ad iovem elevans” (“whinnying and lifting his teeth heavenward”). Likewise, Lucius’ final observation, that the entire preparation of  the chamber now seemed to the matrona to have constituted 29. Zimmerman 2000, 435. 30. These distinctions are present immediately after the transformation, where, in marked contrast to Apuleius’ version, Lucian makes no mention of  his narrator’s now huge endowment, placing in Lucius’ mouth only the observation (15), ejgø de; ta; me;n aßlla oßnoÍ h®men, ta;Í de; frevnaÍ kaμ to;n nouÅn aßnqrwpoÍ ejke∂noÍ oJ LouvkioÍ, dÇca thÅÍ fwnhÅÍ (“Although I was an ass in every other respect, in mind and intelligence I remained a human, and I was still the same Lucius, except for the ability to speak”). Lucian is careful to observe a distinction between mind and body, even taking pains to clarify, dÇca thÅÍ fwnhÅÍ, since in the tra- ditional Greek view the ability to speak is considered contingent less on human physiology than on intelli- gence, nouÅÍ. Likewise, those places in the Latin version where Lucius later questions the extent of  his humanity are all absent from the Greek version. Subsequently, the disjunction between narration and narra- tive is not a part of  Lucian’s narrative strategy: in the barn Lucius states simply that the horses were de- fending their feed against the incursion of  an unfamiliar quadruped; Lucian’s narrator is not conspired against by his fellow pack animals; let loose in the field, Lucian’s narrator nowhere indicates that he is planning, or even desiring, to mate with the mares. Likewise, it is simply inaccurate to claim, as does Zim- merman (2000, 435), that “in passages which give rise to obscene descriptions, the Onos tends to be more extensive and explicit than the Met.; if  the spurcum additamentum were to be accepted as authentic, it would run counter to the pattern observable in such passages everywhere else.” The scenes that I have pre- viously cited all contradict this claim, as does the more extensive study, “I luoghi erotico-scollacciati delle Metamorfosi e il LOUKIOS H ONOS,” found in Pennisi 1970, 55–123; see as well the arguments of Journoud 1965. That certain details vital to understanding the intended parallel with the breeding barn, such as the ointment being applied to the nostrils, are accidentally present in Lucian’s Greek version has no bearing at all on the additamentum, unless one improperly treats Lucian’s version as a “phenotext,” which it clearly is not. Lucian, or a pseudo-Lucian, is imperfectly transmitting an earlier account, and based on his principles of  exclusion, the absence of  the material contained in the additamentum is pre- cisely what we should expect. A careful interpretation of  this scene leads to important conclusions about the origins of  the various ass stories. For an introduction to this question, and good bibliographies, see Mason 1978 and 1993. </page> <page sequence="15"> Apuleius’ Metamorphoses 363 an intolerable delay, is characteristically ironic, more accurately reflecting as it does his own heightened state of  arousal. At the same time, we cannot exclude the possibility that the bestiality involved in this scene might itself  have been a familiar spectacle.31 The woman’s specific actions in such a spectacle would be required, on account of  the same physiological difficulties present in breeding asses with mares, to follow those of  a handler. On the other hand, even if  such spectacles were rare, the parallel from the breeding barn for each step of  the interaction be- tween Lucius and the matrona would have been immediately recognizable to many ancient landowners. Finally, it has been proposed that the additamentum amounts to a kind of “adoration of  the phallus” that is foreshadowed, perhaps even demanded, by the preceding narrative, beginning with Lucius’ own observation immedi- ately after his metamorphosis. In a narrative driven by Lucius’ percolating sexual desire, the reader is constantly reminded that Lucius is now hugely endowed. Apuleius is careful to strengthen this awareness by occasionally forcing the reader to focus his or her attention on this anatomical fact. For example, when Lucius is placed on the auction block, and Lucius’ physical condition is questioned by a skeptical buyer, the auctioneer tells Lucius’ eventual buyer, “If  you place your face between his thighs, you will quickly determine what enormous endurance he would show you” (“nam si faciem tuam mediis eius feminibus immiseris, facile periclitaberis, quam grandem tibi demonstret patientiam,” 8.25). Apuleius, as we have seen, is careful to postpone for his metamorphosed narrator not only a bestial consummation, but also sex between Lucius and his fellow quadrupeds. Likewise, Apuleius deliberately alludes to Lucius’ huge endowment while purposefully withholding until the novel’s climactic scene an expected graphic description of  this. To assert that such an “ado- ration” is called for by the narrative, and even desired by the reader, is to recognize that it is largely irrelevant whether or not bestial spectacles ac- tually took place on the ancient stage, and that it is more important to rec- ognize that a pornographic, bestial spectacle is unfolding here in the tenth 31. See Salisbury 1994 for a discussion of  bestiality from late antiquity through the Middle Ages. Sal- isbury reminds us, for example, of  the strict penalties for bestiality that Christian legislators found it nec- essary to prescribe at the Council of  Ancyra in 314 (88). Although it is impossible to know how common bestiality might have been in the arena, it is ironic that most scholars are willing to accept that the other spectacles presented on the Corinthian stage are representative of  real events. Likewise, representations of bestial scenes similar to what we find in Apuleius are common in Greek and Roman art; see Johns 1982, 108–11. A sixth-century b.c.e. red-figure cup by Epiktetos in the National Museum in Naples (RP 27669) portrays a reclining, nude female offering herself  to a donkey, while terracotta lamps depicting women engaged in intercourse with donkeys or horses were still being produced in the third century c.e. Such art, Johns (1982, 111) writes, “should possibly be considered in relation to stories such as the Golden Ass. . . . It is reasonable to suppose that such public exhibitions did take place.” The Kinsey report pro- vides ample evidence that bestiality, particularly between male humans and females of  other species, will be present, and widespread, in most agricultural societies: in the 1940s perhaps as high as 50 percent of males living on farms in America had experienced some sexual interaction with animals (Kinsey 1948, 671). But, interestingly enough, Greek and Roman art rarely represents males engaged in bestiality: Johns (111) writes that “a number of  representations of  women with animals on lamps are matched by only one figure-type of  a man copulating with an animal (a donkey).” One possible conclusion is that the images on Greek and Roman lamps reflect not the common varieties of  bestiality pervasive in agricultural societies but rather the bestial spectacles occasionally witnessed in urban centers. </page> <page sequence="16"> 364 Ephraim Lytle book of  the Metamorphoses, and most readers, morally outraged or not, find it irresistible. Winkler writes, If  a reader genuinely disapproves of  vampire stories or pornography, why did he or she keep on reading? The only way to reach Book 11 is via the unambiguous, centrally im- portant, and wholly endorsed depictions of  witchcraft, sexual hedonism, and bestiality. . . . there are Catonian contexts in real life in which one might feel called on to disap- prove Lucius’s affair with Photis or the Corinthian lady’s desire for the ass, but such a perspective does not enter the Asinus Aureus. Winkler correctly infers both the importance of  the additamentum to the scene as a whole, and the damage that omission of  it would inflict on the text, and he is clearly right when he observes that those who would omit the ad- ditamentum “castrate the text at its most graphic moment.”32 Duke University 32.
