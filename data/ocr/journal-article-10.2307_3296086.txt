<plain_text><page sequence="1">ZEUS IS DEAD: EUHEMERUS AND CRETE IT HAS BEEN SAID that throughout the mil- lennial history of pre-Christian Hellenic civilization, paganism had neither apolo- gists nor blasphemers. This unique phe- nomenon is normally attributed to the fact that classical religion was unrevealed and therefore endowed with a fluid theogony capable of absorbing the most contradictory theological claims and doctrinal tenets. Thus the absence of a prophetic tradition and the lack of a rigid theology suggest the reasons for the emergence of an admirable spirit of religious tolerance in classical antiquity. Euhemerus of Messene was one of the few pagan thinkers whose views were not only considered unorthodox in a world of universal forbearance but were viciously attacked by the most devout adherents of paganism.' Yet euhemeristic ideas survived the polemics of the pagan zealots in the work of the Siceliot compiler Diodorus, who accepted their validity and incorpo- rated them into the sixth book of his his- tories. Consequently, Diodorus is our main source for the theological theories of Eu- hemerus, and it may be assumed that his account is trustworthy since he was in the habit of adding his source materials into the general scheme of his chronological com- pendium without noticeable revising or modifying. According to this version, Euhemerus was the writer of a novel of travel entitled Sacred scripture, which dealt with the origins of the pagan gods. The author claims to have journeyed into the Indian Sea and to have visited the island of Pan- chaea and the Temple of Zeus Triphylius, where he discovered a golden column which revealed to him the truth about the gods. This column, Euhemerus explained, bore an inscription on which the deeds of Uranus, Cronus, and Zeus were recorded. It was clear from its contents that these gods had originally been humans who had governed and served mankind and had been deified by their grateful subjects post mor- tem.2 Scholars generally agree that this anthro- pological theory of the gods was suggested by the rationalistic tendencies of the Hel- lenistic world which had witnessed the superhuman achievement and subsequent deification of Alexander; but it is also con- ceded that Euhemerus was perhaps influ- enced by the anthropomorphic elements of Oriental and particularly of Egyptian theol- ogy in formulating his religious views.3 1 The testimonia and fragments of Euhemerus are found in F. Jacoby's Fragmente der grieckischen Historiker, No. 63. Callimachus may be considered the most outspoken critic of Euhemerus. His utter contempt for the man is expressed in an iambic verse quoted by the doxographer Aetius and Sextus Empiricus: ypwov iXac v aiitKa 6LXiaL lP7XEL. See Jacoby FGrH, No. 63, T4a, b. For the criti- cisms of Plutarch, see T4e. 2 See Cicero's comments, FGrH, T4d. 3 The Oriental practice of deifying benevolent mortals is singularly manifested in present-day India. The antiquity of the custom is unknown but not different from the euhemeristic account of Panchaea. A recent example illustrates the similarity. During the Indian Mutiny, an English doctor, Captain Stewart, saved from destruction a number of sacred Hindu temples and was subsequently deified by the grateful believers, who caused a temple to be constructed and his effigy to be placed in its niches alongside with those of the traditional Hindu gods.

SPYRIDAKIS Moreover, Euhemerus may be credited as the writer who systematized and explained an ancient and widely accepted popular be- lief, namely that the dividing line between gods and men is not always clear. The extent of this tenet with its natural implications, i.e. the confusion of the human with the divine and of the several degrees of divinity, is well-known to students of ancient religion. In fact, no less a sage than Thales of Miletus undertook to illumi- nate this chaotic theanthropism by differ- entiating god and the minor divinities and heroes, for according to tradition, ,rpw-ro Oag &amp;aLpE d . . .

Yet throughout the history of the Greek world a handful of thinkers who understood the absurdity of pagan polytheism had at- tempted to offer explanations of its essen- tially human nature." Their onslaughts, which shook the very foundations of Olym- pus, had often affected the traditional tol- erance of the pagan theologians, who were once again compelled to defend the old faith by undertaking to ridicule the theories of Euhemerus, one of the most influential of the new apostles of impiety in the Hel- lenistic world.7 It is generally agreed today that the ro- mantic element in the work of Euhemerus has no historical basis. In fact, few of his contemporaries had accepted the authentic- ity of the journey to Panchaea, since, as Plutarch acutely explained, neither Greek nor barbarian had ever seen the island, ex- cept Euhemerus.8 Evidently the author of Sacred scripture has employed a familiar genre of Hellenistic writing, that of the Utopian state, in order to convey his re- ligious message. An ideal society on an exotic tropical island had been imagined by Iambulus, another Hellenistic writer,9 and the idea is by no means unique in ancient literature. Yet it is obvious that the fictional and legendary account of Panchaea should not be discarded altogether. In a passage which merits our attention the author enumerates as inhabitants of the island several historic peoples whose presence constitutes a tribute to their supposedly advanced religious ideas which justified membership in the ideal state that served as model for the theories of Euhemerus:10o KaTroLKOw l 8' avT77v avTOXolVo ALv of nayXaotL XEo4JLEvot, cTrXkv8cs 8" KEaVraLt Ka'L IV8~O Kai VKOaL Kai KpgreT. A careful examination of this passage may therefore be useful. Obviously, geo- graphic factors explain the presence of the autochthonous population and even of the Oceanites on the island of Panchaea. More- over, the tendency among the Greeks and all civilized peoples to search for the high- est intellectual achievements of humanity in remote and strange lands should be taken into consideration. During the course of the Hellenistic Age, contacts with the East reinforced the old Utopian fantasies of the Greeks and the fabulous land of Asia 35,8 (1935) 502, where the story is given and nu- merous photographs are shown. It should be remembered that legendary Panchaea was located near the Indian world. 4 Stobaeus, Sentent. p.279. 6 Pindar, Nem. 4.1.

Lawson, Modern Greek folklore and ancient Greek religion (New York 1964), p.65. o This criticism of the traditional gods took different forms, from Xenophanes' pantheism to the complete denial of the divine advanced by some of the sophists. Among the ancient thinkers who sought to explain the divine rationally was Anaxagoras. Moreover, the scepticism de- riving from the Socratic schools led to complete atheism, with Theodorus of Cyrene as its main exponent. We should differentiate, however, between atheists who denied the existence of the divine and those thinkers who ques- tioned the validity of the existing pagan gods and were merely guilty of do-reta. See A. B. Drachman, Atheism in pagan antiquity (London and Copenhagen 1922). 7 In addition to the remarks of Callimachus, see Plu- tarch's evaluation of Euhemerus (FGrH, T4e). 8 Plutarch, ibid. 9 The story of Iambulus is preserved in Diodorus 2.55f. 10 Diodorus 5.42.5.</page><page sequence="3">ZEUS IS DEAD: EUHEMERUS AND CRETE 339 India occupied a prominent place in their Utopian literature."1 The Greek search for ideal societies was not limited, however, to the Indians, whose sophisticated culture and philosophical pro- clivities were worthy of admiration; it was extended to savage people, who could hardly claim to be members of the civilized world. Besides, Cynics such as Phylarchus of Athens were eager to contrast the sim- plicity of life in numerous primitive groups, including the Scythians, with the pampered and effeminate mannerisms of their Hel- lenistic contemporaries and to pronounce the former much wiser than the latter.12 It appears, then, that Euhemerus fol- lowed current Hellenistic trends in includ- ing these peoples among the citizenry of Panchaea, the ideal state where wisdom is all-pervasive and the truth about the gods well-known. The presence of the Cretans in the Uto- pian community of Euhemerus, however, poses a different problem, since they, as Hellenes, are not only distinct from the re- maining inhabitants, but a privileged group as well. In fact, Euhemerus claims that the priests of Panchaea were of Cretan origin, since their ancestors had been brought to the island by Zeus during his earthly wan- derings as a mere mortal king. A number of Panchaean words of Cretan derivation, Euhemerus implies, constitute an undis- puted proof of this early hieratic coloniza- tion and of the influence exerted by the Cretans on their new homeland.13 In attempting to justify the existence of a Cretan element in the population of Panchaea, the student of euhemerism can- not ignore the special relationship of the pagan gods to Crete, that most privileged domain of classical mythology, the birth- place of Zeus Dictaeus, of Minos and Rhadamanthys, of Epimenides the Seer and purifier of Athens from the KvXOvELov 1yo1, the island most closely associated with Zeus, the father of the pagan pantheon. Crete even today, after two thousand years of Christianity, has not entirely betrayed the Great Thunderer. The Cretan moun- taineer, nominally Christian but an un- suspecting cryptopagan in many of his be- liefs and religious practices, echoes the suppressed loyalties of his ancestors in an invocation to Zeus heard only recently on the island, OTr/7 ov Zav c Gd!14 Moreover, Crete occupied a preeminent position in the writings of Greek philosophers. We may remember that the dialogue of Plato's Laws is imagined as taking place on the island and that his ideal constitution is almost of a Cretan type.15 In retrospect, we may conclude that the exalted if not sublime station of Crete in Greek mythology, her association with benevolent lawgivers and above all with Zeus, and the idealization of her institu- tions in the works of ancient philosophers, explain in part her symbolic representation in a Utopian state inhabited by wise men who are aware of the true nature of the pagan gods. Yet this logical hypothesis may not be totally satisfactory in view of the proverbial notoriety of the Cretans in the Hellenistic world. It should not be forgotten that the anar- chic state of affairs in Hellenistic Crete contrasts sharply with the traditional and idealized portrayal of the Cretans as an orderly and well-governed society.16 Eu- hemerus, as a world traveler,17 must have been aware of their evil reputation and therefore prudent enough not to single them out as the wisest and most orderly members of the Hellenic family. 11 Even Greek visitors had idealized India in their writings. See the fragments of Megasthenes, Nearchus, and Onesicritus of Astypalaea in Jacoby's FGrH, Nos. 397, 133, 134. 12 Phylarchus is No. 81 in Jacoby's FGrH. For an ana- lytical study of his treatment of "exotic" peoples see T. Africa, Phylarchus and the Spartan revolution (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1961). 1' Diodorus 5.46.3. 14 B. Schmidt, Das Volksleben der Neugriechen und das hellenische Altertum (Leipzig 1871), p.27 and J. C. Law- son, op. cit., p.74. 15 The enthusiasm of Plato for Cretan ways is clearly shown in the Leges. For an appreciation of his constitu- tion see Leges 712e. 16 The chaotic situation in Hellenistic Crete is discussed by Polybius (24.31.1) and other Hellenistic writers. 17 According to Diodorus (5.1), Euhemerus travelled ex- tensively as an envoy of Cassander, the Macedonian con- tender for hegemony in the Hellenistic world.</page><page sequence="4">340 It appears, therefore, that an explanation of the unique treatment of the Cretans by Euhemerus must be sought in their religious beliefs and practices. Indeed, a detailed examination of Cretan religious life reveals an observance which sets the islanders apart from the rest of the Hellenes and suggests their religious foresight and rational think- ing. More specifically, the Cretans had de- creed the death of Zeus long before the triumphant onslaught of Christianity de- prived him of his realm and, consequently, provided Euhemerus with a concrete exam- ple of the pervading rational religious feel- ing of his time. The most significant manifestation of this pagan form of bloodless deicide was the display of the tomb of Zeus in Hellenistic Crete.1s Obviously, the inhumation of the father of the gods presupposed his human existence and was in agreement with the theories of Euhemerus, as Ennius, the chief Latin exponent of euhemerism, did not fail to observe in his own Sacra historia.19 In addition to Zeus the Cretans had en- tombed a number of other legendary figures who had been regarded by the Greeks as semidivine. Thus they had ostensibly in- terred Idomeneus and Meriones near Cnossus and Lycurgus not far from Per- gamum, in western Crete.20 The persistence of this folly in Christian times is indicative of its deep-rooted nature, since the tomb of Kaiaphas2l was shown to startled visitors until quite recently on the island. In view of this widespread practice, the student of euhemerism may reasonably question whether the reference to the Cre- tans in Sacred scripture is merely fanciful or coincidental. Is it not more plausible to assume that the rationalistic views of Eu- hemerus were encouraged, if not inspired, by these strange Cretan practices?22 We may also note that both Callimachus and Plutarch, the most uncompromising opponents of euhemerism in ancient times, had been highly critical of the moral con- duct of the Cretans. Is this mere coinci- dence or the result of a strong bias against the essentially atheistic Cretans who had committed the gravest of sins by proclaim- ing the death of Zeus? The attitude of Callimachus at least is quite clear. He considered the islanders a race of liars precisely because they had dared to inhume Zeus, who was not subject to death but immortal:23 Kpires del 4E1TCat"L' Kal ' yp Tdov, 6 &amp;Pa, acro KpipTes EEK7rJiaJro" abi' 8' o Odves, acrL ya&amp;p This characterization, supposedly derived from the legendary Cnossian seer Epi- menides,24 was subsequently embraced by Paul of Tarsus and bequeathed as a maxim to the Christian Oecumene through the Gospels.25 It seems, therefore, that these euhemeristic tendencies may well explain the ancient notoriety of the Cretans as liars, for they had perpetrated the preposterous falsity of burying Zeus, the immortal despot of the pagan pantheon.
