<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS. Einleitung in die Philosophie. By Prof. Friedrich Paulsen. Berlin : Wilhelm Hertz. 1892. Friedrich Paulsen, professor at the University of Berlin, writes this ' ' Intro duction " not so much for connoisseurs as for students, whom it may serve as a guide. He discusses in general outlines the various fundamental problems of phi losophy, at the same time indicating his own position, which, in more than one re spect, is very similar to the philosophy presented in the columns of The Monist. His own view, which, as he trusts, is the general tendency of modern philo sophical thought, he calls "idealistic monism." It is opposed, on the one hand, to supernatural dualism, and on the other hand to atomistic materialism ; the former being the traditional doctrine of the schoolmen and of ecclesiasticism, separating body and soul, nature and God, etc., each into two distinct realities, which are acci dentally combined, the latter being an attempt, having its beginning in the eigh teenth century, to explain all natural phenomena in a purely mechanical way. Paulsen adds : ' ' The whole history of modern philosophy can be said to be a con ' ' tinuous attempt to overcome this opposition. . . . The principle of natural science "is the Natur-Gesetzm?ssigkeit of all events. . . . Modern materialism derives from ' ' this a kind of metaphysics, represents all reality as a system of blindly operating ' ' physical forces. . . . Philosophy undertakes to dispel the opposition of these two ' ' doctrines ; its proposition is?and we may say that this is the main-spring of the ' ' entire evolution of modern philosophy?to reconcile the religious world-conception " with that of natural science. There are many who regard this aspiration as a sort ' ' of squaring of the circle, and we grant that some similitude between the two may ' ' exist, for here as well as there we can attain only to approximations, here as well ' ' as there we can never solve the problem finally and forever. At any rate, we "must recognise the fact that the whole philosophical thought of the last three " centuries has been directed towards this goal." Professor Paulsen classes the various philosophies of the present time as fol lows : (1) The phenomenalistic-positivistic philosophy which denies any absolute cognition of reality, least of all in physics ; the world of objects is a world of phe nomena. (2) The idealistic monistic philosophy. To define the nature of reality</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS. 467 as it is in itself, we must rely upon the data of our inner experience. The intel lectual-historical world is to us the most comprehensible denouement of reality?in fact, the only comprehensible one. The ultimate idea to which we are led in tra cing out facts, is this : Reality, which presents itself to our senses in the objective world as a unitary system of motions, is the appearance of a spiritual all-being, which must be conceived as the evolution of some unitary idea. In this respect idealistic monism agrees upon the whole with speculative philosophy, or rather with all idealism since Plato. The philosophy of the present time is, further on, characterised (3) as passing from intellectualism to voluntaryism ; namely, it allows the will to have its legiti mate influence in the construction of a world-view. It is (4) evolutionistic-theolog ical, which latter tendency meets half way the above-mentioned idealistic monism. Both are beginning to permeate ethics, sociology, jurisprudence, and politics. The old formalistic methods are dropped and teleological considerations prevail. Pur pose is recognised to rule in life. Lastly (5) the philosophy of to-day is historical. The older philosophy is mathematical-naturalistic or abstract-rationalistic. Specu lative philosophy precedes the construction of an intellectual-historical world ; it then attempts also to construct nature historically, at least in a logico-genetic schem atism. Natural science has already pursued this course in its cosmical and biolog ical theories of evolution. It is apparent how these tendencies follow the old tradi tion of harmonising the physical and the intellectual-historical worlds into one uni tary conception of the whole. The book is divided into two parts, with an introduction and conclusion. The introduction defines the relation of philosophy to mythology and to the sciences. Philosophy cannot be separated from the sciences. Says Paulsen : " Figuratively ' ' speaking, reality is a great riddle proposed to man ; all the various sciences de * ' termine some parts of it, and the attempt to solve the whole, to find the key to " the mysterium magnum of being, is called philosophy." The first book treats, in two chapters, of the problems of metaphysics, viz. : the ontological problem and the cosmo-theological problem. In the former chapter materialism, panpsychism, and the nature of the soul are discussed, while the sec ond chapter is devoted to atomism and teleological theism, implying such subjects as the theory of evolution, causality, pantheism. The second part reviews, in the first chapter, the problems of the theory of cognition, viz. : the idealistic argu ments, the realistic views, and our knowledge of the outer world. The second chapter presents an expos? of the problems regarding the origin of cognition as viewed by rationalism and empiricism, paying special attention to Kant's formalistic realism. The conclusion is a brief treatment of some ethical problems. It is impossible to discuss all the details of the 444 pages of Paulsen's book, but a few specimen quotations from the chapter " Pantheism and World-soul " may be welcome to our readers. Our author asks : Considering all the tendencies of yearn ing and willing that appear in the innumerable forms of reality, is there a unity of</page><page sequence="3">468 IHK MONIST. inner life corresponding to the unity of the physical world in its universal inter action ? The affirmation of this question constitutes the idealistic pantheism. Idealistic pantheism is to Professor Paulsen the simplest and most obvious construction of the world possible. To other world-views, the existence of the soul is a problem ; it has even been called an "absolute problem." " I believe," he adds, with great truth, " that there can be no stronger argument against any world " view than that it regards the existence of soul as something absolutely mysteri "ous." There is a power of conviction in idealistic pantheism verified by the astonishing agreement of the testimonies of many various thinkers in the Orient as well as in the Occident, in antiquity no less than in modern times. (P. 243.) Says Professor Paulsen : " The dayfly may imagine when the sun sinks that "all is at an end ; light vanishes forever and the whole world is swallowed up in "darkness and death. But man who sees so many suns sink and rise should have " learned that in the infinite there are many possibilities which he cannot see at "present [p. 241]. The conception of a world-soul, of a spiritual all-being, of a ' ' ?nitidus intelligibilis appears to our physicists and physiologists in the same light " as the conception of anthropomorphic deities?as a childish dream. They have no "need of this hypothesis [pp. 243-244]. Du Bois-Reymond declares that a natur " alist before admitting the assumption of a world-soul should demand, 4 that we " ought to find somewhere in the world neuroglia embedded in warm arterial blood " under the proper pressure and provided with appropriate sense-organs, ganglions, "and fibres, corresponding to the intellectual capacities of such a soul.' An ani " mal," says Paulsen, "needs as a matter of course legs to stand upon and to move " with, a stomach, teeth, eyes, and a central nervous system, but the All is not in " need of this ; it needs no legs to stand upon and to move with, no stomach for ali ' mentary purposes, no eyes, no ears, for there is nothing to be seen or heard out-' " side of it, and so it can also dispense with a nervous system and a brain." Quoting two passages, one from Fechner, the other from N?geli, to the effect that the system of fixed stars might be regarded as a group of molecules in an in finitely larger whole which we should have to conceive of as a unitary organism, Paulsen says : " Indeed, there is no objection to regarding a planet as a ganglion of " the world-brain. Is it too large? No. Why should not the world-brain have " bigger cells than an animal brain. Or is its composition inappropriate ? Why ? " We find in it the same materials, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, phosphorus, and "so forth, and also innumerable interactions similar for all we know to those that " take place in a ganglion. Who knows how striking would be the resemblance of " their structures, if we could but see a ganglion under a sufficiently powerful mag " nifying glass." These ideas are mere possibilities and are presented as such, but we cannot at tribute to them any philosophical, scientific, or religious importance. Our idea of " a world-soul " or, better, of God, is different and we avoid purposely anything that can be constructed upon the basis of a vague hypothesis.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS. 469 We ourselves reject pantheism, the view which identifies God and the All for reasons which we need not repeat here. We call our view of God entheism, and in forming our idea of God we purposely avoid such fantastical assumptions as con sidering the possibility of solar systems being molecules in the organism of a huge world-animal. Granted the truth of this view, the mere possibility of which we can not deny, this extraordinary creature or world-animal would not be God, its will would not be our moral authority ; it would not be the eternal, the immutable, the ground of all being, the ultimate rule of action, and the omnipotent universal law of existence : it would merely be a creature like ourselves, only immeasurably bigger, evolving like other animals and subject to the same or analogous or perhaps similar wants, disappointments, sufferings, and joys as ourselves. What a miserable God such a world-being would be ; we know nothing of him and he knows nothing of us. His will and aspirations would have even less influence upon our aspirations, than, for instance, the hopes of a man upon the molecular groupings in his tissues, we being only the parasites upon the crust of an atom of his tissues. We have pre sented our view of the subject in Vol. Ill, No. 2, pp. 249-257, of The Monist, in the third part of the article " Panpsychism and Panbiotism," with reference to a similar hypothesis incidentally touched upon as a possibility of monistic theism by Professor Romanes. We simply state the difference between our position and that of Professor Paul sen concerning the nature of a world-soul without intending to make more of it than he does himself ; for, if we are not mistaken, it is with him a mere suggestion. We conclude our review with a passage which shows Professor Paulsen's atti tude toward Christianity, which more than anything else proves the general agree ment of his work with ours. He says : "The Christian faith is not a philosophical system, not a theological dogma " and still less the residue of an old superstition, but the immediate and living cer " tainty of the heart concerning the nature of the good and its importance in real "life. This faith can be to-day the same as it was in Luther's, or St. Augustine's, "or the apostles' time who saw Jesus with their own eyes bodily. If Christianity, ''did indeed consist of a number of doctrines and opinions, it would certainly be " true, as some claim, that it has been dead a long time, for doctrines and opinions * ' are not long-lived. If Christianity really did consist of the belief in the creation "of the world five thousand years ago out of nothing, the rib story of Eve, the story "of Eden and the fall, etc., etc., .... then indeed it would be impossible for a " thinking man of to-day to be a Christian. But all that is not the faith of Chris "tianity, it is not the religion of Jesus. And if all the leaders of all the confessions "declare that this is the Christian faith and that he who does not believe all these 4 things can have no part in Christ, their proposition must be rejected as untrue. "No one can be saved by believing these things ; while the request of the church " to believe in certain opinions set forth by men has expelled many an honest man. " .... In the life and death of Jesus I have learned to understand the meaning of</page><page sequence="5">47o THE MONIST. ' ' life and I call God and the revelation of God that which makes my life possible "and explains to me the significance of my life. ... Is such a faith compatible "with the above-mentioned monistic world-conception? My answer is, By all " means." This is Professor Paulsen's solution of the problem of a reconciliation of science and religion?and we add that it is ours too. p. c</page></plain_text>
