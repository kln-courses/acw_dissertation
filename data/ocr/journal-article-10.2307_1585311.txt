<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST does not include the text from Cave 11 (11Q17), which is published in DJD 23, pp. 259-304). The fourth part (pp. 403-25) is an edition by Esther and Hanan Eshel and Ada Yardeni of 4QApocryphal Psalm and Prayer (4Q448). This manuscript con- tains two texts. The first, which is discussed by E. Eshel, is Ps. cliv 17-20, and it is considered alongside the text in 11 QPsa and the Syriac version. The second is a prayer for ywntn hmlk, who is identified with Alexander Jannaeus. "The text of the scroll is written in a careless semicursive script which is difficult to decipher" (p. 404), and the palaeography is discussed by Yardeni, who deciphered it and points out its importance: the text was probably "copied during Jannaeus' lifetime and... is thus the only doc- ument from Qumran published to date which can be assigned with almost complete certainty to the first half of the first century BCE. Hence, this document is extremely important for Hebrew paleography" (p. 405). This text and its historical background are discussed by H. Eshel, who comments that it "is the only Qumran document pub- lished to date whose author's world view is incompatible with that of the sect's mem- bers, who opposed the Hasmonaeans" (p. 415). The volume ends with concordances to the different groups of texts, which were prepared by Stephen and Claire Pfann, and the plates. [J.A. EMERTON] D.A.S. FERGUSSON, The Cosmos and the Creator: an Introduction to the Theology of Creation. 115 pp. SPCK, London, 1998 ?9.99. This book is a revised version of the Cunningham lectures which Fergusson delivered in Edinburgh in 1996. The first chap- ter concerns creation in the Bible. Here he examines the attention which theologians have accorded to a theology of creation and its relation to salvation. Fergusson gives an outline of the Old Testament's theology of creation, and focuses on the image of God in man and the human dominion which that entails. The chapter finishes with a discussion of creation and redemption. The second chapter, entitled "Creation and Cosmology", starts by looking at the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo, how it has been devel- oped by theologians from Irenaeus to modern times, and the problems which such a doctrine poses. Fergusson then moves to look at the cosmological proof, and then con- cludes the chapter by discussing the Big Bang Theory and the work of the scientist Stephen Hawking. The third chapter is a discussion of the relationship between the theory of Evolution, theology and the Bible. Fergusson highlights the theological and scientific weaknesses of creationism, and instead seeks to develop a more constructive engagement with evolutionary theory. He then discusses divine action in the world, with special reference to the work of John Polkinghorne, and concludes the chapter with a section on the place of animals in the world. The fourth chapter, "Creation, Evil and the End of Life", examines questions of theodicy and original sin, and con- cludes with sections on scientific and biblical eschatology. Fergusson has produced a stimulating and thought-provoking examination of the theology of creation which use- fully combines biblical study and the concerns of moder theology. The book is an excellent introduction to the subject. [PJ. HARLAND] Steven FINE (ed.), Jews, Christians, and Polytheists in the Ancient Synagogue. Cultural Interaction during the Greco-Roman Period. Baltimore Studies in the History of Judaism. xviii + 253 pp. Routledge, London &amp; New York, 1999. ?50. This clearly focussed and very well edited volume brings together authoritative essays on important aspects of the study of the synagogue in the Roman period, and will be essential reading for any serious scholar of ancient Judaism. Given the time-frame, its relevance for OT stud- ies is inevitably limited, but due attention is paid to the question of the public read- ing and exposition of the Torah and other biblical books, the importance of which is duly underlined by E.P. Sanders, in his survey of "Common Judaism and the syna- gogue in the first century". Pieter W. van der Horst, in a cogently-argued rebuttal of Heather McKay's book Sabbath and Synagogue, argues that such activity is to be understood as constituting worship within the context ofJudaism, and not merely education. Lawrence H. Schiffman, "The early history of public reading of the Torah", is anxious to resist 413</page><page sequence="2">414 BOOK LIST the anachronistic use of later documents and the reading back of later practice. Among other interesting contributions which touch on the subject of Torah reading and study, Reinhard Pummer considers the position in early Samaritan synagogues, our knowledge of which has been greatly extended by recent archaeological work. [N.R.M DE LANGE] PJ. GENTRY, The Asterisked Materials in the Greek Job. Septuagint and Cognate Studies Series 38. xxxvii + 559 pp. Scholars Press, Atlanta, GA, 1995. This is a slightly revised version of the author's PhD thesis presented to the University of Toronto in 1994 (supervisorJ.W. Wevers). Gentry provides an exhaustive analysis of the asterisked material in the Greek text of Job. The study was aided by the publication in 1982 of the Gottingen volume by J. Ziegler, which provided a reliable platform for examining the reviser's text. The work falls naturally into three sections, in addition to the con- clusion. First, Gentry ascertains exactly what material can be attributed to Theodotion. A brief historical survey of the textual tradition and an introductory methodology pre- cede a detailed examination and analysis of Ziegler's edition. Once the scope of the project has been established, the second chapter attempts a characterisation of the material. Nouns, pronouns, verbs, transliterations and particles are considered, in addi- tion to verbless clauses and word-order. This type of method is employed "since even a cursory examination of the asterisked materials reveals that the approach of R in rendering the Hebrew is literalistic and quantitative" (p. 85). Naturally this assessment of translation technique is rather lengthy-just under three hundred pages-but it pro- vides a firm basis for the section that follows. Ch. three attempts to place the aster- isked material in the larger textual history ofJob, by contrasting R with the Old Greek of Job, the "So-Called Kaige Group" (Minor Prophets Scroll from Nahal Hever), the Greek Psalter and Aquila. A very brief final chapter summarises Gentry's conclusions. The volume concludes with four appendices, proposed corrections to the lemma of Ziegler's edition, and a bibliography. [J.M. SQUIRRELL] J.C.L. GIBSON, Language and Imagery in the Old Testament. ix + 166 pp. SPCK, London, 1998. Even if Gibson admits that the OT is "capable of causing not a little embarrassment to the two religions which have adopted it as their Scriptures", he finds it also "seductive", "moving" and "illuminating". His little book is meant to guide the reader to fuller appreciation of these latter qualities and in this he must be judged to have succeeded. His first of seven well-written chapters, entitled "The Energies of the Hebrew Language", suggests the lack of abstract terms and the linking together of clauses by "and" as the "two basic characteristics of biblical Hebrew". The picture is filled out by several not unimportant features: prominence of direct speech, cosmo- logical descriptions of heaven and Sheol, the extravagance of Semitic address, folk ety- mologies, figurative language, hyperbole, personalisation, irony, etc. Throughout this chapter Gibson indicates the considerable distance which separates theological lan- guage from that of the OT. In ch. two ("Language about God in the Old Testament"), Gibson approaches the (non-)problem of anthropomorphism by way of the recognition that all theology is metaphorical. Faced with such incautious expression, the point is to understand rather than to approve. A discussion of the incomparability of Yahweh (closer to henotheism than to monotheism) rounds off the chapter. Full-blown monothe- istic statements such as Isa. xliii 10 represent "the exaggeration of faith" rather than systematic theology, since so much of the OT refuses to evacuate creation of other "theologically real" gods. Ch. three ("The Rhetoric of Hebrew Prose Writing") asks us "Why Prose?", a question occasioned by the paucity of ancient near eastern precedent. En route to a tentative answer in terms of narrative theology, Gibson guides us through such features as composite authorship, reticence, the resonance of key words, and char- acterisation by what the protagonists say, here and there pausing to criticise the "fissiparous tendencies" of "excavatory scholarship", too full of sources and too deaf to accomplished story-telling.
