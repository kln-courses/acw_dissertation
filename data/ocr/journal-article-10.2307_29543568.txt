I had chosen Macdonald and Salter to be part of the Six Young Architects exhibition that I organized at the Heinz Gallery of the Royal Institute of British Architects back in 1984 ? as much for their poetic and romantic approach to architecture as for their extraordinary drawing skills. It was fascinating to look again at the work, seen, this time, not under the umbrella of their practice, CODA, but as the work of two individuals. I had hoped that part of the effect of the Six Young Architects show would have been some commissions for architects who had yet to build, yet to show in three dimensions some of their clearly exceptional design skills. This was something of a naive hope ? architects as clever as these two may win compe? titions and have exhibitions, but the very individu? ality of their talents makes it hard for them to create buildings in a very commercial world. Of course this should not be the case. The shortage of clients for new private houses in Britain is not replicated in the United States ? regrettably, the scheme for a house on the River Lambourne in Berk? shire remains unbuilt, but it is a significant example of a house design developed to a specific brief. The need for less esoteric approaches to the housing mar? ket may be a part of the problem ? architects like Macdonald and Salter appear to be very specialized and private to the outside world. Their work, on the other hand, is so careful and yet liberating that one longs for their ideas to be exercised in three dimensions. What is it about their work which makes it so rare and so interesting? They belong to an import? ant tradition. Names for this tradition are manifest. Call it organic, free-form, free-style, assemblage; it has strong roots. The work of Herb Greene in the United States comes immediately to mind. But there are older and deeper roots, in the work of Hans Scharoun, who so successfully mixed expression? ism and international modernism. Another German architect of that period is brought to mind, Hugo H?ring, who succeeded in humanizing the Modern Movement tradition, less as an advocate of organic architecture and more as a developer of his 'indi? vidualistic' approach to architecture, developed through the specific requirements of client and site. More recent work in Germany by G?nter Behnisch, a graduate (as was H?ring) of the Technische Hoch? schule, Stuttgart, has many of the qualities of form arguing with reality mat are apparent in Macdonald and Salter's drawings. It is the argument between form and reality that is at the heart of the designs recently shown at the AA. The influence of contemporary British architects contributes to this debate, in particular Peter Cook, whose theoretical work, while enlarging our view of structural possibilities in the city, has questioned the individuality of buildings by creating mega-designs for the whole city. The influence of Ted Cullinan is clearly seen in the diffuse use of materials and in the conviction that individual buildings can be (indeed should be) designed for particular human and siting considerations. These apparently contradictory in? fluences are reflected in the tension that can so clearly be seen in each design. There is positive tension rather than conflict. The resolution of the apparent conflict is where the particular genius of Macdonald and Salter lies. The first instance of a particular brief meeting the poetry of their design solution can be seen in the drawings for the Oriental Studies Museum Extension for the University of Durham (competition entry 1982-3, published in AA Files 7, September 1984). For a prominent wooded site these architects pro? posed, first of all, a solution that is clearly romantic and inspired by the wooded nature of the site. The exhibition of prized and rare objects is set in a series of special rooms located in the hillside along a con? crete walkway. The main exhibition area occupies a large single volume that, lurking in the trees, is apparently indistinct in form. The provision of a 'twilight zone' crossed by bridges leading to the major space is an inspired and evocative idea. The remarkable drawings for this project are so clear that it is entirely possible to imagine that the scheme is already built on its densely wooded hill? side. The metal ramps leading to loggias that over? look the Durham countryside, the Cor-Ten panels on the steel frame, and the glass floors supporting the glass showcases ? all are painstakingly worked out. The first-floor plan shows at a glance the elegant collision of the grids, the dynamic entry, and the brilliant siting of the building. How much of the scheme's success lies in the clarity of the presentation and the superb line? I think that the means used simply enhance the ends. Look at the overlapping Cor-Ten panels on the south-facing facade. They suggest the scales of some armoured animal ? or more likely the suit of chain-mail and polished steel that may well have been worn by the oriental potentates whose pos? sessions now fill this museum. The symbolism of a building that appears to have grown from its hillside is entirely appropriate for a small campus museum ? it is a strong and powerful place, protective of the riches within. In the second major project exhibited at the AA, the ICI Trade Pavilion for the Royal Agricultural Showground at Stoneleigh Abbey, there is a more ICI Trade Pavilion: Detail of cast-steel column-head. developed anthropomorphic sense. Possibly inspired by the stout oaks of that part of the English Mid? lands, the dominant element of the design is the row of five columns supporting a shallow-vaulted roof on fan-trusses. They are tree-like in their sturdiness and somehow very appropriate for gatherings of English farmers. Because the building is not entirely enclosed, it has the temporary quality of a tree house ? all the floors and walls being of timber, with the only sense of permanence given by the concrete service zones. The anthropomorphic qualities of Macdonald and Salter's work is seen again in the competition entry for an extension to a retreat settlement on the island of Iona (1986). Sheltering the whole complex from the rough weather of the islands is a long blockwork wall. The long lines of rooms follow the arrange? ments of animal shelters, tucked into the sides of the hills and rocks. The refectory and meeting-room has a high roof pitched at an angle that is unique to these architects. The construction is rudimentary ? cor? rugated sheet on a steel frame and, inside, timber and insulated birch-faced lining. The language and materials, although similar to the earlier work, are here much simpler and yet more sophisticated. Sheep may safely graze among the steel, wood and concrete ? elemental shelter for both man and beast. In Venice, for the 1985 Biennale, many archi? tects entered designs for a new Accademia Bridge. Macdonald and Salter produced a tour de force of counterpoint construction. There are two bridges, one of them climbing higher than any other Venetian crossing. The drawings for this project, with shad? owy overtones of crashed U.S. Air Force bombers, brilliantly emphasized the fragility of the city of Venice ? and perhaps the illusory nature of all beautiful cities. The collision and contrast of all of Macdonald and Salter's work reached a poignant and moving climax in this proposal for the bridge in Venice that takes you from the everyday world into the imaginary realm of the art on the gilded walls of the Accademia. It is the unbuilt house on the River Lambourne in Berkshire that brings the stretched-out spinal plan to a completely satisfactory resolution. The long, ser? pentine brick wall that follows the riverside con? tours holds together all the ribs and limbs of family life. Like any animal with a backbone, this house de? pends on a central jointed link that connects all the parts. Although houses cannot move, they are organic, and to imitate nature in the plan is both sensible and convincing. Cor-Ten steel boxes, vaulted rooms, the conservatory ? all are grasped, and at the same time released to be independent elements, by the discipline of the wall. Elemental yet kindly, this house is of the landscape, yet strongly alive as a built form. It is one of the most original and intriguing house designs to have sur? faced in Britain recently. It is tragic that it could not be built ? because it is clearly a case of the dream not being better than the reality. Macdonald and Salter must build. They have produced on paper, with delicacy and skill, an archi? tecture that almost breathes. May they move soon to the built world and transform it.
