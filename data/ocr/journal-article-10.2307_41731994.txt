Indeed, rock paintings and petroglyphs are associated with caves the world over. Some of the most famous images from prehistoric times -bison on th√® run, fleet- footed deer- derive from cave walls located deep underground. Now a unique cave in eastern Tennessee, near Knox- ville, has opened a whole new field of scientific inquiry: the study of cave art left on walls, not of rock, but mud-mud that has, of course, long since dried out and become firm, though brittle. "Mud glyphs," as these new forms of art have come to be called, are remarkably fragile records of earlier human activity. But they are no less vital a form of testimony than their sturdier counterparts that have been left behind on rock surfaces. Discovered in 1980 by a local sport caver, Mud Glyph Cave became the subject of serious research in 1982, when a team of investigators led by the author undertook an intensive program to study and document its contents. Funded by a grant from the National Geographic Society and carried out under the auspices of the University of Tennessee, the work lasted into 1984, and has resulted in comprehensive publication of the site. Four essential objectives governed the work in Mud Glyph Cave, and constituted its four main phases. The first objective was the closing off of the cave from public access with the full consent and cooperation of the land- owners. The second included mapping the cave in detail and surveying the cave floor for cultural remains. The third involved making a complete photographic record of the numerous mud glyphs-art forms created by digging or carving grooves in the walls' mud face; and the final phase entailed visits by specialists in cave archaeology and the art of prehistoric peoples. What emerged from all this study was a fascinating pic- ture of the ways m which this cave once figured in a larger cultural trend -the use of caves as sacred ritual sites. Contrary to what we might have expected, Archaic peoples in the American South had been notably unafraid of the "dark zones" of caves -the inky-black inner areas not reached by light from the entrance- way. Indeed, they had explored these areas freely, and had exploited their mineral resources as early as the fourth millennium B.C. By the first century A.D., however, these peoples had ceased using the dark zones of caves for such pragmatic ends, even though they continued using the mouths of caves as habitation sites and shelters. Instead, some of these people began using the dark zones for the burial of their dead. For per- haps a millennium this practice per- sisted. During this era, the Woodland period, new belief systems seem to have emerged, systems that regarded the deep recesses of caves as fear- March/April 1988 31</page><page sequence="3">Masterpieces qfthe Mud Glyph Gallery: clockwise from top Iqft - round face or mask with modeled nose; "man-in-the-moon" face; excised disk area transformed into turtle by added appendages; mask showing weeping or forked eye motif; running stick ball player; mace glyph. some places, not to be entered except for spiritual purposes. Radiocarbon dates from the interior of Mud Glyph Cave indicate that it was entered by people bearing torches as early as around A.D. 420 and as late as about A.D. 1750. But most of the visits seem to have fallen between the twelfth and the sixteenth centuries, with the greatest concentration occurring in the thirteenth century. Cultur- ally speaking, these dates stretch from the Middle Wbod- land period (0-A.D. 500) through the Mississippian period (A.D. 900-1750). Several of the motifs found among the glyphs are particularly characteristic of the Dallas culture, a Mississippian-period culture found in the eastern Ten- nessee Valley from roughly A.D. 1200 until early historical contact times. There seems little doubt, when all the evi- dence is taken together, that Mud Glyph Cave was an im- portant ritual site over the course of several centuries. Mud Glyph Cave is a very damp place -so damp, in fact, that no perishable artifacts would have survived. It was clearly never used as a place of habitation, and we suspect that early visits were of relatively short duration. It is entered today, as it probably was centuries ago, through a stoop and crawlway and two narrow keyholes that lead into a large stream passage. This passageway winds below what is now called the "glyph gallery"- an up- per gallery reached by climbing a steep mud bank, some ten to 15 feet high, into which footholds or steps have been cut, probably by the aboriginal visitors. The glyph gallery begins 120 meters (394 feet) from the cave entrance and stretches above the stream bed for a distance of 96 meters (315 feet). Glyphs cover the walls on either side of the gallery, which widens out after about 70 meters (230 feet) into a broader area with a high ceil- ing. This area is called the "fireplace room" because of the amount of wood charcoal, mostly of pine, which has been scattered about and trampled into the floor. Glyphs cover the upper as well as the lower walls in the fireplace room. The higher ones may have been incised into the clay with a long pole. The terial clay which on the ranges walls from of this five cave cm. is to a 0.5 smooth, meters fine (two ma- terial which ranges from five cm. to 0.5 meters (two to 20 inches) in thickness. It was deposited in thin layers many thousands of years ago when the gallery area was flooded for an unknown period of time. Then the water abated and clearly never flooded the glyph area again. To- day the walls are much drier than they were when the glyphs were drawn, though the cave remains an ex- tremely damp place. Those sections of the walls bearing most of the glyphs have a layer of clay ranging in thick- ness from five to 15 cm. (two to six inches). Charcoal is the only surviving material left behind by the early visitors, and it was crucial in helping us deter- mine the age of the glyphs. The charcoal found in the fire- place room was mostly of pine, and indicates the building 32 Archaeouigy</page><page sequence="4">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="5">A member of the exploratory team inspects a ledge in the glyph-covered, "fireplace room," so called because of the amount of wood charcoal that was found scattered about the cave floor of small, single-event fires. But the trail left on the floor of the gallery has been identified as largely the residue of torches made of cane (Arundinaria gigantea) . The use of torches is further confirmed by stoke or smudge marks found on limestone ledges along the passage. A natural rock-basin hearth situated along the right wall near the end of the glyph passage yielded charcoal from some deciduous species as well. Eight charcoal samples collected from this hearth and from the floor of the gallery have yielded radiocarbon dates, which range from roughly A.D. 420 until 1750 or thereabouts. Most of the dates fall, however- as noted earlier- between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. Un- fortunately, people entering the cave after the glyphs had been discovered trampled a great deal of the charcoal un- derfoot. This disturbance destroyed much of the scientific information which might have been gathered from rem- nants of the torches and the individual fires, as well as from footprints of aboriginal cavers. Four glyph types are visible on the walls of Mud Glyph Cave. Human figures comprise the largest and most var- ied group. There are also animal forms, abstract designs, and motifs that occur repeatedly on Dallas culture ar- tifacts of shell, bone and copper. This last group includes motifs that are particularly characteristic of the so-called "Southern Cult -a religious symbolism found in most Mis- sissippian cultures, including the Dallas culture, through- out the southeastern United States between roughly A.D. 1200 and A.D. 1600. These four groups are not always distinct from one an- other; they overlap in very complicated and sometimes bewildering ways. The abstract designs, for example, sometimes seem to be part of huge human and serpent figures that extend over considerable portions of the cave walls. At other times, however, the abstract designs - particularly "squiggles" or "macaroni," which were made by sweeping fingers or sticks down or along the then moist, impressionable walls -appear to be quite random. Some glyphs, in turn, have been superimposed on others, perhaps for ritual purposes. The glyphs themselves, which number literally in the thousands, were incised into the mud in several ways. Some were drawn with a finger or the jagged end of a stick -probably a piece of cane torch. Others were made by cutting away part of the clay and then embellishing the excised area to create an animal form. In other cases, marks were made by poking or striking the clay surface with the side of a bark-covered pole or with the blunt end of a pole or club. A number of glyphs had been defaced or mutilated by similar means- they were scratched or poked with fingers, scratched with a sharp implement, gouged so that handfuls of clay were missing from them, or scored with fingernails. Far from being a form of vandalism, however, this defac- ing may have been an integral part of the ritual use to which these glyphs were put. The images, in other words, may have been "canceled" in a quasi-magical enact- ment of the outcome their makers desired. Animals hunted as game, for example, might have been symboli- cally vanquished in a ritual that preceded the actual hunt. The same general rule may have applied to enemies, ei- ther human or supernatural. The glyphs representing animals include, however, many species other than normal game animals. There are glyphs depicting the great horned owl, a hawk's head, the woodpecker, an opossum and a turtle. At least two forms of snake are also represented. One of these is a small horned serpent. In addition, there are large serpent-like forms that cover large areas of the cave walls, some ap- parently having wings like similar figures at the large Mis- sissippian ceremonial center at Moundville, Alabama. These large "composite" serpent figures were identified by John Muller of Southern Illinois University, an expert in Mississippian iconography. Unlike the large composite hu- man figures, they take an expert's eye to see. Some of the animal glyphs are especially notable. The great horned owl is small and delicately drawn, and the two turtles in question are interestingly formed. One has a shell or carapace formed by a circular plug of clay cut from the wall, while the head, legs and tail are repre- 34 Archaeology</page><page sequence="6">√çFH|pP^pMIM||y|Bi¬ªp¬ªffi March/April 1988 35</page><page sequence="7">sented by radiating lines. The other turtle is associated with a rectangular human mask superimposed over one of two human footprints. The heel print of the right foot forms the turtle's carapace. The opossum consists of a stick figure drawn in a defensive posture: its mouth is open, and its prehensile tail is arched over its back. But the human forms command the most attention. Many of them, to be sure, are so simple and childlike in their execution as to seem almost comical -male and fe- male stick figures; bodiless heads with round, moonlike faces; "man-in-the-moon" profile drawings with exagger- ated noses and chins. One slightly more realistic glyph is a small stick figure of a male with exaggerated genitalia and an upraised hand that appears to be holding a stick of the kind used in ball games. The game in which this stick was used was played by most Indians in eastern North America, lacrosse being one of its modern variants. The more naturalistic, full-bodied anthropomorphic figures include a pos- sible warrior, several "eagle-beings" or bird-men, and possibly the player of a game known as chunkey. Chunkey was an Indian game that had disappeared by the eighteenth century, but it had been observed by earlier European ex- plorers. A variant of the two-player hoop-and-pole game, chunkey involved rolling a disc-like stone down an alley- way or yard of packed sand and throw- ing poles at the stone, the object being to get as close as possible to the stone's resting place. The glyph which may de- pict a chunkey player has a "man-in- the-moon" profile with a weeping eye, a diamond-shaped body, and what may be a shell gorget (a decorative pendant) drawn on the chest. One arm is upraised; the other is extended downward and holds what may be a chunkey stone. Armlets and bracelets are clearly depicted on the limbs. One human glyph is particularly realistic. It is a large (ca. 92-cm, or 36-inch) human figure, possibly a warrior, wi^h well-executed legs and feet and upraised arms. A hu- man head or skull may be suspended from his belt. The head of this figure was defaced and gouged by the pre- historic Indians, but a hair bun is discernible. A number mud glyphs. of so-called These beings "eagle-beings" are men appear of the Mississip- among the mud glyphs. These beings are men of the Mississip- pian culture dressed up as birds of prey- possibly hawks or falcons, though most likely eagles. Such role-playing is a tradition that the Cherokee still depict today in their summer historical pageant, "Unto These Hills," at Chero- kee, North Carolina. The face is beaked and the arms are covered with feathers. One of the eagle-beings is a large figure, almost two meters (seven feet) tall, which was drawn on a high ledge above the glyph-passage floor. It has a beak-like face and wavy lines or "squiggles" descending from the shoulders which probably represent feathers. The third such figure has a head with a weeping eye, a hair bun at the back of the head, and lines radiating from the top of the head which may represent a decora- tive hairstyle. Wavy lines emanating from the body are be- lieved to represent wing feathers on a cape. The geometric figures which are found in Mud Glyph Cave include circles, the circle-cross, circles and rectan- gles with radiating lines (possibly sun symbols), rectan- gles, and diamonds. All these figures are prevalent in pre- historic art throughout many parts of the world. Other figures more specific to the so-called "Southern Cult" include the weeping eye or forked eye, which is the most common cult motif found in the cave. Others include the ogee, a circular or oval outline with two opposite ogival points and a smaller circle or oval inside; the bi- lobed arrow, possibly a symbolic spearthrower; and the mace. But these three motifs occur only rarely, whereas the more common geometrical designs occur in abun- dance and sometimes seem to form part of a large animal or human figure. The strongest evidence for con- struing these glyphs as having ritual importance lies in their connection to the motifs found on Mississippian ritual objects -objects such as the aforementioned shell gorget, and cop- per plates. The fact remains, how- ever, that we know relatively little about the use and meaning of these glyphs; it is unclear, for example, whether the cave was visited by soli- tary individuals who wished to com- municate with deities or spirits or possibly renew their individual vi- sions; or whether the early visitors entered the cave in groups. We also cannot say whether Mud Glyph Cave represents the idiosyncratic expression of a handful of lo- cal people, or whether it conforms to a regional pattern of ritual drawing on rock and mud in caves and shelters. It is difficult, then, to say at this juncture how significant the study of mud glyphs will prove to be. Two other caves containing mud glyphs, however, have been recently discovered; one in Virginia and one in Kentucky. In both cases, the glyphs are located in the caves' dark zone, and in both cases the designs are abstract and aboriginal. But their numbers do not compare with those . in Mud Glyph Cave. The work at Mud Glyph Cave is completed at this point, and the cave is securely gated. But the search for additional dark-zone art in caves of the area continues, thanks to an additional grant from the National Geographic Society. It will be especially intriguing to see what addi- tional information we can gather about the major cognitive shifts which occurred in the belief systems of prehistoric American Indians- one occurring some 2,000 years ago, and the other apparently around the end of the first millennium A.D. Why did the Archaic peoples explore the deep recesses of caves with such evident fearlessness? And why did their successors come to regard caves as forbidden places, fit at first only for the dead, and subse- quently only for ritual purposes? We cannot say exactly. Curiosity about these intriguing questions, however, is certain to furnish the impetus for vigorous future research in our southern caves. ‚ñ° 38 Archaeology</page></plain_text>
