Ino Rossi St. John's University, New York City Jean-Marie Benoist's book is a rewarding study of modern French struc- turalism and related intellectual movements-movements that the English reader frequently finds discussed in a very cursory, controversial, and often contradictory literature. This can hardly be surprising if we realize that modern structuralism has emerged out of a typically French intellectual debate in reaction to the empiricist orientation in its historical, phenome- nological, and positivistic varieties. It is no surprise, then, that the sparse reactions to structuralism which have appeared in the English-language sociological literature are of three inadequate kinds: positive but only mar- ginally illuminating, critical for the wrong reasons, or downright misleading in propounding misinterpretations of the movement. The Structural Revolution proves to be a lucid, though at times complex and highly metatheoretical, presentation of key issues raised by the struc- tural movement. Benoist interrelates ably various ideas which constitute the intellectual background of structuralism and shows various differences as well as linkages among exponents of different forms of structuralism. More important, he knows how to capitalize on various ideas that emerged as reactions to or developments of structuralism, so that he points out where the enduring validity of structuralism can be found. This volume is 1247</page><page sequence="2">American Journal of Sociology a distinct contribution to the history of ideas and, though not written by a professional sociologist, it is important reading for sociologists; the latter can no longer defer reckoning with a movement which has already per- meated many of the humanities and social sciences. Such a task is even more imperative if we consider Levi-Strauss's claim that his approach en- compasses what remains valid in Durkheimian sociology. In the opening chapter Benoist presents structuralism not as a doctrine but as a new methodological frontier, or rather frontiers, given the existence of various forms of structuralism. For Benoist these are the main sources of structuralism: the Saussurian notion of language as a set of differential contrasts; the independent discovery of the notion of "structure" by the Bourbakist mathematicians; and the philosophical insights of Leibniz, Gaston Bachelard, Martial Gueroult, Jules Vuillemin, and Victor Gold- schmidt. These thinkers have convergently stressed the need to understand a phenomenon or a "text" as a closed and self-referring system to be ex- plained not on the basis of the concrete and empirical determinations of the elements but on the basis of a formal set of elements and relationships among elements. Benoist discusses also the contribution of literary critics who have argued that a text should be analyzed as an autonomous entity in and by itself (e.g., Proust) and those who have argued that its meaning derives from its relationship with other texts (as in Kristeva's notion of "intertextuality"); in line with these principles, Roland Barthes has shown that a given text carries a multiplicity of meanings in virtue of its own structure. Since the text is characterized by such an "openness" and "free- dom" and has a purely relational meaning, the subjectivity of the author is no longer important to determine meaning. Moreover, the subject is no longer understood as a conscious subjectivity (as in the works of Descartes and Sartre) or as a transcendental entity but as a set of syntactical struc- tures (Lacan). Concurrently, Michel Foucault has shown that the transition from one epistemology to another is best explained not by reference to man but in terms of transformations of rule systems. With the abolition of the transcendental and conscious subjectivity comes the end of the uni- lineal and monodeterministic conception of history (e.g., that proposed by "economist" or "vulgar" materialists). Then too comes the end of the supremacy of diachronic explanation over synchronic explanation. Benoist considers Chomsky's works as a kind of integration and extension of Jakob- son's work and finds in Levi-Strauss an anticipation or a parallel develop- ment of Chomsky's transformational approach. Surely, Jacques Derrida may have a point when he criticizes both phenomenology and structuralism for being prisoners of Western metaphysics-they, in fact, assign a priv- ileged place to Logos (and speech and phonological patterns). However, Derrida's stress on "deferment" and "writing" are seen by Benoist not as a destruction of structuralism but as an opening up of new structural fron- tiers. It is in Chomsky's and Levi-Strauss's works that Benoist finds the development of new structural objectives; in the new "open mathematics" he finds the tools for bringing the promises of new structural frontiers to full fruition. 1248</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Chapter 2, a difficult chapter to read, is readily summarized. Althusser's contribution consists in rejecting mechanistic and humanist Marxism and in asserting the specific and autonomous influence of the superstructure on the infrastructure, the overdetermination of contradictions, and the deter- minacy in the last instance of the economic factor. Benoist's critique is a devastating one: Althusser is a positivist who opts for the primacy of formal simplicity and rational logic, both of which are antithetical to di- alectical thought. With Althusser, dialectic is pluralized, negativity is elim- inated, and syntactic contradiction is replaced by semantic ambiguity (overdetermination); moreover, dialectic is understood as the logic of the heterogeneous, and therefore it becomes an idealistic dialectic. In chapter 3 the question of the arbitrary (Saussure) or nonarbitrary (Pierce) relationship of signs to things they represent is discussed together with the larger question of the relation between nature and culture. Both Levi-Strauss and Chomsky deal with this question at its very fundamental level, that of language and code. Levi-Strauss avoids the pitfall of indi- vidual subjectivism by assimilating culture to language and by focusing on the formal structure of language, with the related notions of paradigmatic network and universal combinatory matrix. Yet, by seeing culture as in- herent in nature, Levi-Strauss seems to remain a prisoner of Western meta- physics and its substantialism (Derrida's objection). Chomsky, on the other hand, vindicates the specificity of language, which he explains as a system of autonomous transformations generated from the innate structure of mind. Here Chomsky joins Kant in an antiempiricist posture which accounts for experience in terms of a priori formal conditions. However, it is not quite clear how, with the notion of structures innate to individuals, one can avoid metaphysical essentialism, psychological reductionism, and Cartesianism. According to Benoist the best antidote to these pitfalls can be found in modern biology with its formulations in terms of linguistic codes and in the Lacanian conception of the unconscious as language and syntax. Chapter 4 is an excursus through modern biology and its explanations of living organisms in terms of information theory, "invariables," and scriptural language (Monod). However, Benoist argues that in modern biology one can still find the traps of traditional epistemology and the ves- tiges of traditional humanism, existentialism, and anthropomorphic prag- matism-and so a falling away from Bachelard's and Kant's achievements. In chapter 5, the longest and pivotal chapter, Benoist presents his own synthesis of semiotic structuralism and elements of Lacanian Freudianism. He starts by stating that at the end of the 19th century we witnessed an axiomatic breakthrough-the advent of formal logic and the superratio- nalism of Bachelard. Seen from these perspectives, dialectics becomes in- adequate because it is based on contradictions and the notion of contradic- tion is not appropriate to explain development. Moreover, the human mind does not work through an endless splitting up of things but rather by setting up systems of relations whose form remains constant. Consequently, what matters is a general formalization based on transformations, variations, and translations. Benoist discusses Serres's development of Bachelard's 1249</page><page sequence="4">American Journal of Sociology formal approach and accepts Piaget's notion of structure as a system of self-regulating transformations. At this point he raises the question whether the Freudian unconscious disrupts the Leibnizian network and the syntactic order. Benoist rebuts Deleuze and Guatarri's critique of Lacan and Levi-Strauss for its substantialist, causalist, Cartesian, and positivistic biases. Lacan shows the productivity of the semantic process in the sense that the latter corrupts the syntactic order: such a productivity, however, remains within the structure, since the structure controls the entry of the subject into the symbolic. Benoist argues that the notion of the corruption of the syntactic order by the unconscious permits one to avoid the danger of a formalistic structuralism and to opt for a dynamic structuralism and an open Marxism as well. It is true that Godelier and Althusser have lib- erated Marxism from a linear and causalistic view; but Benoist reiterates that with Althusser one still faces the danger of axiomatizing contradiction and transforming it into an idealistic combinatorics. According to Benoist the Freudian notion of "overdetermination" permits us to avoid such a danger, and at this point Benoist delves amply into Lacan's and Kristeva's notions of the productivity of the subject located in a decentered network (and so a subject not understood as individual subjectivity). Chapter 6 recounts the merit of Levi-Strauss's relational approach, in which thought is conceived as thought about relationships and not as a consciousness of an object. Levi-Strauss holds a relational innatism closer to Piaget's position than to the subjectivist innatism of Chomsky: Benoist finds Levi-Strauss's schematism and formal approach akin to Kant's a priori schemata, and the same is true of Levi-Strauss's notion of a self- regulated transformational network. Levi-Strauss does not abolish history but axiomatizes it and subordinates it to structure. One might argue that Levi-Strauss seems to be a prisoner of the metaphysics of the "hereness" and the "present." However, for him myths continously split off from them- selves and continuously generate dissymmetries and discontinuities; through this process the system remains always decentered. Where, then, is the locus of the structure? This is the question discussed in the last chapter of the book. Structure is not an essence nor does it have a cause; instead, structure is a strategy, an operational rule used to decode all aspects of human reality, including variations and changes. Benoist reiterates that the transcendental schematism of Kant lies at the origins of structural intelligence; schematism is also the absent source, prior to em- pirical intuition, from which tropes unfold in a web of invariances. Whereas transcendental schematism is the site of the decentered origin of structur- ality, heterogeneity-and not contradiction-is the constitutive mechanism of structurality (as Freud and Lacan have shown). The reader of this volume is exposed to an intense series of insights and suggested connections among apparently heterogeneous ideas, a series not easy to assimilate. One cannot deny the brilliance of Benoist's interpretation of structuralism as an antiempiricist, antisubstantialist, anticausalist ap- proach. Benoist is brilliant, too, in redeeming structuralism from the usual ingenuous objections of psychological reductionism, formalism, idealistic 1250</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews combinatorics, and staticity. He also makes a skillful but selective use of Lacanianism to liberate Marxism from the unilineality of contradiction and to avoid the Althusserian idealistic combinatorics. The Freudian (Lacan- ian) input insures also an open, dynamic, and productive thrust of struc- turality which is presented as an operation of a mathematical and axio- matic nature. For this reason one must see in structuralism the culmen as well as the avenue for a synthesis of all forms of scientific endeavor. The conventional sociologist will find in this volume enough material to allow him to reexamine stereotyped interpretations of the humanistic and antihumanistic forms of Marxism. The nonindividualistic notion of sub- jectivity, the dialectic and constitutive relationship between the structural and subjective principles of explanation, as well as the Lacanian interpre- tation of Freud, constitute a springboard for a profound rethinking of such fields as the sociology of socialization, the development of moral order, and the relationship between social structure and personality. More fundamen- tally, the structural perspective forces on the sociologist the arduous task of reelaborating traditional sociological paradigms and strengthening them with solid epistemological foundations and important analytical dimensions.</page></plain_text>
