Rev. J. G. Wood, best-selling natural history author, Common Objects of the Microscope, 1861.' The microscope has lately been to physiology much what the steam engine has been to manufacture and transit; it has opened up new regions for observation and given an entirely new direction to our thoughts... We are probing more into the very deepest recesses of nature, and enquiring into her closest secrets. G. M. Humphry, Cambridge Professor of Anatomy, Address to Section D of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1866.2 Nothing is more surprising to me than to find a number of instructed persons coming up here for scientific education, and to discover that they cannot observe. They have been so accustomed to take statements on credit from books and word of mouth that they have almost lost the faculty of seeing things for themselves. I remember after having given a lecture, accompanied in my ordinary way by diawings on the blackboard, that I went to look through the microscope, and see what one of the students who had heard this lecture was drawing. To my astonishment, I saw that his drawing was the thing I had drawn on the blackboard not the thing under the microscope. I said to him, What is this? this is not at all like what is under the microscope. No, he said, that is what is on the blackboard. He did not believe nature, he believed me; and the great lesson I have tried to teach, which is the fundamental basis of scientific teaching, is do not put too much faith in your teacher, but do believe nature. T. H. Huxley, Dean of Normal School of Science and Royal School of Mines, Address at Awards Ceremony, South Kensington, 1882.3 What sort of activities took place in the academic laboratories developed for teaching the natural sciences in Britain between the 1860s and 1880s ? What kind of social and instrumental regimes were implemented to make them meaningful and efficient venues of experimental instruction?

Previous studies have documented chemists' effective use of regimented quantitative analysis in their laboratory teaching from the 1820s,4 but less is known about how Victorian academics made other sorts of laboratories unproblematic pedagogical spaces.5 This paper will examine the literary, disciplinary and instrumental technologies of microscopy deployed by T. H. Huxley at his South Kensington laboratory during the early 1870s to render his biology teaching legitimate, meaningful and efficient. As such it is a response to Pickstone's recent call for a broader account of microscopy teaching in late nineteenth-century academic life science, and one localized answer to Bennett's enquiries as to what the appearance of a microscope in laboratories and other domestic settings betokened to historical actors, and how such tokens changed over time.f Although recent sociological scholarship has been directed almost exclusively at research laboratories, the social characteristics of such institutions have close analogues in the teaching laboratory. Collins, Latour, Woolgar, among others, have shown that the enculturated expertise of a hierarchy of experimental workers in a research laboratory is habitually pitted against that of rival groups in other laboratories. In such situations, disputes characteristically arise in which each group contests the competence and interpretation of experiments carried out in other laboratories; such disputes are resolved by the negotiation of a consensus amongst the laboratory groups concerned.7 With regard to the resolution of such disputes Bruno Latour has discussed the intriguing claims made by scientists concerning the agency of 'Nature'. Before a consensus is reached, what 'Nature' does or says in the disputed phenomenon is the central issue of disagreement between experimenters, and yet when a consensus is subsequently attained, experimenters claim that this is because 'Nature' has univocally intervened to act as a referee in the dispute.8 A potential for similar disputes over competence and interpretation arises in the teaching laboratory, yet in an effective course of practical instruction such disputes generally do not arise. Why should this be the case? When relatively unskilled students carry out their own laboratory experiments, how can teachers prevent these students persistently contesting their authority-laden views on the competence and interpretation of such experiments? 4 J.

H. Huxley also invoked 'Nature' as the source of laboratory authority responsible for leading a student to the 'correct' experimental result in microscopical histology. To account for Huxley's use of such a pedagogical resource this discussion will begin by showing how 'Nature' was domesticated'0 into the metropolitan parlour and laboratory between the 1850s and 1870s. This domestication process will be characterized as a strategic enlistment of the microscope, by a diverse community of natural historians, as a trustworthy indoor mediator of 'Nature'. Considering this domestication as a problematic displacement of 'Nature' from the pastoral 'field' into the humanly constructed institutional environment I shall discuss the legitimation procedures employed to effect this transition. First I shall discuss the embedding of microscopic practice within a morally cogent power-laden discourse" of 'Nature', and the strongly political use of this discourse to recruit mass audiences for domesticated life science. This will be followed by an explanation of the socio-technical procedures by which the microscope was rendered instrumentally 'transparent' as an indoor mediator of 'Nature'. In considering the microscope as a device whose status and conditions of proper usage were arrived at by processes of social negotiation my account will necessarily diverge from traditional accounts of microscopy which have generally treated the microscope as an unproblematic extension of naked-eye observation.'2 Instead, I shall discuss the development of practical skills, descriptive language, and above all procedural conventions employed by Victorian microscopists to portray their observations as constitutive of non- artefactual knowledge of 'Nature'. Such arguments will serve as a contextual framework for an analysis of the institutional 'discipline "3 that was deployed by Huxley and his demonstrators to establish the new South Kensington biology laboratory in 1871 as a 9 P.

In the conclusion I shall draw upon historical evidence and sociological arguments presented in this paper to interpret the mode in which 'Nature' resided in the laboratory of the Victorian teacher of microscopical life science. RECRUITING 'NATURE': THE SOCIAL USES OF WORDSWORTHIAN DISCOURSE When once this phraseology [of Laws of Nature] was introduced, the poets and mythologists soon took hold of it and made it subservient to their purposes. Nature was personified: the phrase law of Nature ... became a law laid down by the goddess Nature to be obeyed by her creatures. From the poets, this fictitious personage speedily penetrated into the closets of the philosopher... J. S. Mill, letter to the Republican, 3 January 1823.1" The deployment of 'Nature' in modern European discourses of theology'6 and gender relations'7 is well known, yet there is no extant general analysis of the cultural meanings and social functions of this term. To contribute towards such an analysis I would like to explore how a discourse of omnipotent female 'Nature' was appropriated by scientific groups in Victorian Britain, especially microscopists, as a powerful literary device for conferring legitimacy upon their knowledge-creating and knowledge-diffusing activities.18 Allusions to 'Nature' by such groups drew principally from texts of Wordsworth and Coleridge and often followed their general practice in capitalizing the term to signal its cultural authority; G. B. Tennyson has argued, for example, that Wordsworth's rendition of 'Nature' was read by Victorians as that of a feminine 'moral teacher instructing by vernal impulse'."9 In what follows it will become evident that such a rendition of 'Nature' was ubiquitous in the reading and writing of a diversity of Victorian scientific texts. Nevertheless, as Jordanova has suggested, users of this discourse could negotiate other attributes of 'Nature' to meet their sectional interests; for example, men of letters such as Arnold and Hardy debated the moral qualities of 'Nature' embodied in this discourse.20 By contrast, social groups claiming direct contact with 'Nature' conventionalized the moral benificence of 'Nature' but made divergent claims as to the location and affiliation 14 For a fictionalized rendition of a Huxleyean regime of microscopy in the mid 1880s, see H.

As we shall see, field naturalists and laboratory teachers/practitioners of life science claimed privileged access to, and allegiance of, 'Nature' in their own specialist territory. The diffuse network of amateur naturalists active throughout much of the nineteenth century ritually invoked 'Nature' as a maternal figure allied to their outdoor activities by dint of its unique residence in the pastoral 'field' wherein they collectively gathered their zoological, botanical and mineral specimens. Morrell and Thackray have shown that co- ordination of the field activities of philosophical institutions, societies, and individual workers across Britain was undertaken by the British Association for the Advancement of Science from its initiation in 1831; thus we find at the first meeting of the Association that Viscount Morpeth employed the discourse described above in promoting the new organization as 'destined ... to glean fresh harvests from the unexhausted field of Nature '21 Morrell and Thackray further discuss how the BAAS recruited 'Nature' to act as a normative moral ally in promoting their scientific activities as conducive to the maintenance of 'natural order' in a society troubled by threats of intense socio-political upheaval in the 1830s and 1840s.22 The didactic rendition of 'Nature' was harnessed in such a normative fashion throughout the rest of the century: Victorian natural historians typically projected their speciality as an uplifting moral activity, the co-operative ventures of specimen- hunting in the countryside epitomizing the virtues of piety, social responsibility, selflessness, healthy exercise and a general eschewing of metropolitan vice. 'Nature' was thus a congenial resource both for the mediation of social order through natural history field clubs23 and, in the guise of Samuel Smiles' hagiographies of the naturalists Edward Grant and Robert Dick, for promulgating canons of private moral conduct.24 In the controversies that followed Darwin's publication of Origin of Species, 'Nature' was characteristically invoked as the natural historian's agent of reconciliation. In 1863, the Edinburgh University Professor of Botany, John Hutton Balfour, used the platform of his address to Section D of the BAAS to argue that no other study than natural history was 'better calculated' to quell 'unruly passions'. In support of this claim he cited the botanist Dr [George] Johnston of Berwick: There is a pre-ordained and beneficial influence of external nature over the constitution and mind of man ... We are all the better for our botanical walks when taken in the right spirit. They soothe, soften and exhilarate. The landscape around us becomes our teacher, and from its lesson there is no escape: we are wooed to peace by the impress of nature's beauty...25 to which Balfour added 'many a time while carrying on botanical researches in the wide field of nature ... have I felt the force of these remarks .26 Lynn Barber has shown that proponents of this quasi-natural theology of field work - 21 J.

J. G. Wood, and Charles Kingsley - harnessed this moral propriety against the activities of their metropolitan rivals: the closet naturalists. In their popular texts of the 1850s and 1860s, Gosse et al. strategically denigrated the integrity of work done by city-based practitioners typically associated with academia, museums, specialist societies and journals. Philip Gosse, for example, derided the un-natural character of indoor study 1851 as far too much a science of dead things; a necrology. It is mainly conversant with dry skins furred or feathered, blackened, shrivelled, and haystuffed ... with uncouth forms, disgusting to sight and smell, bleached and shrunken, suspended by threads and immersed in spirit ... These distorted things are described; their scales, plates, feathers counted; their colours, changed and modified by death or partial decay, carefully set down; their limbs, members and organs measured, and the results recorded in thousandths of an inch.27 Gosse's final comment that the whole of closet natural history 'is enveloped in a mystic cloud of Graeco-Latino-English phraseology' was reiterated by the novelist and clergyman Charles Kingsley in his 1855 Glaucus, or, the Wonders of the Shore. Disparaging 'closet collectors' for occupying themselves in inventing new zoological jargon 'instead of studying the live animals where Nature put them ',28 he remarked archly of the 'endless genealogies' thereby produced that 'not in these pedantries is that moral training to be found, for which we have been lauding the study of Natural History'.,29 Kingsley and Gosse indeed conceded, ostensibly on the grounds of socio-political interest discussed below, the moral propriety of study with the microscope and the aquarium 'at home' by licensing such study as a domestic extension of field work. Nevertheless, the outdoor 'field of Nature' was still espoused as the definitive venue for a morally healthful education; as Kingsley declared to the officers of the Royal Artillery in 1872 concerning 'The study of natural history': I would train the mind of a lad who was to become hereafter an officer in the army - and in the navy like-wise - by accustoming him to careful observation of, and sound thoughts about, the face of nature; of the commonest objects under his feet, just as much as the stars above his head; provided always that he learnt, not at second hand from books, but where alone he can really learn either war or nature - in the field; by actual observation, actual experiment. A laboratory for chemical experiment is a good thing, it is true, as far as it goes; but I should prefer to the laboratory a naturalist's field club, such as are now prospering at several of the best public schools, certain that the boys would get more of sound inductive habits of mind, as well as more health, manliness and cheerfulness ... than they can ever by bending over retorts and crucibles, amid smells even to remember which is a pain forever.30 Given this moral denigration of laboratory teaching how could T. H. Huxley, as an academic practitioner in the life sciences, sustain the discourse of 'Nature in the laboratory' that we can see in operation in the epigraph taken from his 1881 speech at South Kensington? To see the divergence between discourses of 'Nature' employed by field naturalists and laboratory practitioners we can contrast Kingsley's oration with that of a 27 P. H.

E. Roscoe, Professor of Chemistry at Owens College, Manchester.31 In the year after Kingsley's pronouncement Roscoe spoke thus at the opening of his new chemistry laboratory in the Owens Extension College: The lectures serve as giving a general view of the main features of a subject; the laboratory work brings the student into direct contact with Nature and gives him an insight into her processes, which can only thus be obtained. In the lecture room the student forms an idea, as in a panorama, of the general appearance of the country; but it is in the laboratory, as in a walk through a given district, that he first learns what the land he is travelling through is really like. And although we know that we must spend much time and labour if we go on foot, we know that we shall be rewarded by a vivid and lasting impression, and one which may perhaps give a new colour to our lives. It is thus with the study of chemistry; the laboratory is the place where the details are really mastered.32 To the assembled Mancunian dignitaries Roscoe's speech mediated two linked messages. One was that his new laboratory was a privileged venue in which all Mancunians could find direct access to 'Nature'; as such it merited the vast expenditure of the publicly endowed Owens Extension Fund.33 Secondly, Roscoe's bucolic imagery of the laboratory experience as a 'distillation' of the authentic 'ramble' through the great outdoors furnished his audience with a cogent Wordsworthian gloss on the necessity of sending their offspring to learn chemistry in a laboratory - specifically his own. These messages portrayed the laboratory as a place where the metropolitan student of science could encounter 'Nature ' more readily and more authentically than in the pastoral 'fields' indeed so remote from the centre of industrial Manchester. The text of Roscoe's 1873 oration was reproduced in the journal edited by Norman Lockyer, Nature, and this promulgation of Roscoe's address to a broader national scientific audience was symptomatic of the strongly pro-laboratory stance sustained in Nature (see below). The strategy behind the choice of such a title for a journal was clearly one of appropriating a powerful representation of 'Nature' for its metropolitan audience; this appropriation was supported by two further literary devices employed by Lockyer in the launch issue of 11 November 1869. Lockyer's first gambit was to commission from none other than T. H. Huxley a leading article that was a translation of Goethe's aphoristic ' 34 rhapsody 'Nature . Secondly, Lockyer employed an epigraph from Wordsworth which appeared in every subsequent issue (until the mid-twentieth century); subtly adapted from the sonnet A Volant Tribe of Bards on Earth are Found, when juxtaposed with the accompanying 31 The common literary context of Huxley and Roscoe in the 1870s was the Macmillan series of Science Primers which each was writing in his own specialism; see Huxley-Roscoe correspondence in the Huxley Collection, Dawson catalogue, Imperial College Archives. 32 H. E. Roscoe, 'Original research as a means of education', Nature, (1873), 8, p. 539. 33 See J. Thompson, The Owens College: Its Foundation and Growth, Manchester, 1886. 34 Huxley wrote: 'it seemed to me that no more fitting preface could be put before a Journal, which aims to mirror the progress of that fashioning by Nature of a picture of herself, in the mind of man, which we call the progress of science', T. H. Huxley, 'Nature', Nature, (1869), 1, pp. 9-11; for further discussion see G. Beer, 'Translation or transformation? The relations of literature and science', Notes and Records of the Royal Society, (1990), 44, p. 82.</page><page sequence="8">314 Graeme Goodav iconography this fragment would have been read by an educated audience as an evocation of the original 1823 text (see Figure 1). The text of Wordsworth's 1823 sonnet reads: A volant Tribe of Bards on earth are found, Who, while the flattering Zephyrs round them play, On 'coignes of vantage' hang their nests of clay; How quickly from that aery hold unbound, Dust from oblivion! To the solid ground Of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye; Convinced that there, there only she can lay Secure foundations. As the year runs round, Apart she toils within the chosen ring; While the stars shine, or while day's purple eye Is gently closing with the flowers of spring; Where even the motion of an Angel's wing Would interrupt the intense tranquility Of silent hills, and more than silent sky.35 Lockyer contrived to capitalize 'nature' in order to yield the eponymous 'Nature' more typical of Wordsworth, whilst decapitalizing the 'Mind' emphasized thus in the original. Why was this sonnet chosen if such editorial adjustment was necessary to emphasize the status of 'Nature'? The iconography yields a possible answer to this: 'Nature' is implicitly to be read as globally accessible in both wilderness and metropolis. By contrast, other Wordsworth texts typically depict 'Nature' as resident solely in pastoral regions beyond the domain of human artifice - imagery which would not have served Nature's interests in promoting institutionalized teaching and research in science. This interpretation is supported by contrasting Nature's recruitment of adapted Wordsworthian discourse with a very different usage by a periodical launched in 1878 to promote field-work in natural history: the Midland Naturalist. The editors of this journal, E. W. Badger and W. J. Harrison, targetted their publication at the network of natural history societies, field clubs etc. located across the Midlands. To this end they recruited the epigraphic allegiance of 'Nature' from Wordsworth's well-known poem The Tables Turned: An Evening Scene... Although there is no explicit evidence that this was a direct retort to the presumptuousness of Lockyer et al. in appropriating 'Nature' for their urban readership, the epigraph to the first issue of the Midland Naturalist of 1878 gave a partisan summons for practitioners to look outdoors to the field: Come forth into the light of things, Let Nature be your teacher These lines were accompanied by an unambiguous iconography of the outdoor 'Field of Nature', namely the subjects and equipment of the field naturalist (Figure 2). As had been the case with the frontispiece of Nature, these images unambiguously pointed readers to the original Wordsworth text: ... Books! 'tis a dull and endless strife: Come hear the woodland linnet, How sweet his music! on my life, There's more of wisdom in it. 35 'XXXIV', Selincourt (ed.), Wordsworth's Poetical Works, vol. 3, Oxford, 1946, p. 19.</page><page sequence="9">4-D It 14 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ - kV I II I</page><page sequence="10">THE JOURNAL OF THE &gt; S1 AsSOCIATED NATURAL HISTORY, PHILOSOPHICAL, AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOCIETIES AND FIELD CLUBS \ - OF THE MIDLAND COUNTIES.

He, too, is no mean preacher: Come forth into the light of things, Let Nature be your teacher ... ... One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man, Of moral evil and of good, Than all the sages can. Sweet is the lore which Nature brings; Our meddling intellect Mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things:- We murder to dissect. Enough of Science and of Art; Close up those barren leaves; Come forth and bring with you a heart That watches and receives.36 Educated Victorian audiences would have read this subtext as an exhortation to learn direct from 'Nature' in the field rather than stoop to the moral improprieties of 'closet' natural history, namely its murderous mis-shaping dissections. Whilst the Midland Naturalist initially thrived as much as Nature upon its Wordsworthian credentials during its first decade, important evidence can be inferred from the journal's cessation of publication in 1894: its readership had been chronically reduced due to the waning fashionability for natural history in the final decade of the nineteenth century. The cause of this demise can be related to our central theme by reference to a polemical article published in the journal in the previous year by the mycologist W. B. Grove entitled 'The happy fungus-hunter': The glory of the field naturalist has departed. The biologist or physiologist is the hero of the hour, and looks down with infinite contempt upon the luckless being who is still content to search for species ... it is, to say the least of it, decidedly ungrateful of the biologist to pour such vials of wrath upon the poor searchers of the past ... For out of his own spinnerets, like a spider's silk, the closet naturalist cannot evolve the species and genera with which he deals. These are the rewards of one who goes down upon his knees and patiently, hour after hour, turns over heaps of rotting twigs and leaves, or who tramps through woods and fields the lifelong day and returns at night to his study with the spoil. The observations of the laboratory are, of course, right and proper in their place, but a world constructed out of them would bear but little resemblance to the glorious vision which the field naturalist sees unfolding constantly before his eyes.37 What social and material transformations were involved in this fin de siecle displacement of field naturalists' authentic outdoor experience by the artificial, conventionalized constructions of laboratory workers? A clue can be found from the strategic discourse of one famous Victorian laboratory 'missionary', William Thomson, at the 1885 opening of a new physics laboratory for his protege Andrew Gray at the University of Bangor in 36 'II: The Tables Turned...', Selincourt, (ed.), Wordsworth's Poetical Works, vol. 4, Oxford, 1947, p. 57. 37 W. B. Grove, 'The happy fungus-hunter', Midland Naturalist, (1892), 15, p. 161; cited without documentation in Allen, op. cit. (23), pp. 193-4.</page><page sequence="12">318 Graeme Gooday Wales. Thomson characteristically articulated the new hegemony of the institutional experimentalist thus: The laboratory of a scientific man is his place of work ... The naturalist and the botanist go to foreign lands to study the wonders of nature, and describe and classify the results of their observations. But they must do more than merely describe, represent and depict what they have seen. They must bring home the products of their expedition to their studies and have recourse to the appliances of the laboratory properly so-called for their thorough and detailed examination ... The naturalist in his laboratory with his microscope and appliances for the keenest examination, learns to know more than can be learned by merely looking at external beauties.38 In this oration, fully reproduced shortly after its delivery in the journal Nature, Thomson stressed the microscope as the primary tool of laboratory workers in the life sciences: use of this instrument indoors revealed more of 'Nature' than could be learnt by the naturalist out of doors. Close inspection of the iconography of the Midland Naturalist reveals that the microscope (top left-hand corner, rear) was indeed one of a limited range of instruments granted a place in the field-worker's repertoire of indoor study, How, then, had the microscope and allied instrumental technology become legitimate means for extending the 'field of Nature' to the indoor domain? To answer this I shall utilize two themes from Gooding's account of Michael Faraday's experimental lectures at the Royal Institution during the 1850s. Faraday told audiences at his lecture demonstrations that they were learning in 'Nature's School' and Gooding has shown that this discourse of didactic 'Nature' had a two-fold signification. First, Faraday rendered his demonstrations of, for example, magnetic fields, to be 'transparently'39 natural by transforming the skill and artifice required to make the demonstration successful into invisible conventions of pedagogical display. Later it will be seen how the 'naturalness' of microscopical investigation was made to depend upon similarly conventionalized technical practices. The other didactic signification Gooding argues for learning in 'Nature's School' concerns the role played by the audience in Faraday's demonstrations: each member was invited to assent to the view that the success of each experiment was achieved by the 'transparent' mediation of 'Nature'."4 The phenomena of 'Nature' in the Royal Institution lecture theatre were thus as accessible to the observation and ratification of the public as the flora and fauna in the 'field' of the natural historian. We must now consider how and why naturalists created an indoor public for the microscope and its cognate technologies. 38 W.

J. S. Bowerbank at the Royal Microscopical Society, 11 May 1870.41 David Allen and Lynn Barber have both identified the achromatic microscope and the aquarium as the two major instruments of life science in the Victorian domestic parlour during the 1850s and 1860s, the household popularity of the microscope being sustained uniquely, however, towards the end of the century.42 The function of both instruments in the Victorian life sciences underwent a distinctive shift over this period from being mere domestic accessories to the practice of field-based naturalists, to being adopted by both laboratory academics and by the scientific public as the definitive instruments for a relatively autonomous form of indoor life science. I will now show how both devices were promoted as furnishing legitimate domestic access to 'the field of 'Nature' by tracing how practitioners displaced this 'field' from the discourse of outdoor natural history to the discourse of indoor microscopy and aquarium studies. Further, it will be seen how this domesticating extension of the naturalist's territory satisfied the political expediency of aligning microscopy with the contemporary concern for enacting orderly electoral reform amongst the very social strata that constituted the audiences for popular microscopy. Two much debated issues relating to social order in the 1850s and 1860s were the increasing amount of leisure available to the lower classes following the restriction of the working day by the Ten Hours Act of 1847, and the campaigns to extend the franchise of this same majority element of the British public by Parliamentary Reform Act. Peter Bailey cites, for example, a correspondent of the Daily Telegraph who in 1869 argued that the excessive leisure time of office workers spent at large in the great urban centres generally 'tended to make the young man excessively individual' and inclined to lose 'the fear of censure that is the guiding idea of much life in smaller places', namely the disciplined domains of the workplace and home.43 In his account of 'riotous Victorians' Donald Richter argues that of all the disorderly public agitations of the 1860s 'none burgeoned so threateningly as that of the franchise reformers'; he discusses the mass public demonstrations of July 1866 after the Commons' rejection of the last in a series of Lord Russell's Reform Bills and gives a detailed account of the notorious three-day 'struggle for Hyde Park' and its effect in precipitating the Reform Act of 1867, legislation that doubled the electorate by enfranchising over a million artisans and members of the urban lower middle classes.44 In this context we can see the interest of conservative clerical naturalists such as Gosse and the Reverends Kingsley and Wood in promoting the microscope and aquarium household as vehicles of educational leisure, constantly directing the lower classes back to 41 J. S. Bowerbank, 'Reminiscences of the early times of the achromatic microscope', Monthly Microscopical Journal, (1870), 3, p. 285. 42 Allen, op. cit. (23), pp. 128-40; Barber, op. cit.

Conspicuous features of the discourse employed by such authors to promote such normative goals were (i) the egalitarian emphasis on the microscope and aquarium as instruments through which all participants could have access to 'Nature' and thereby become potential discoverers, for example the epigraph from Wood above, and (ii) the subservient relationship that was prescribed between outdoor activities of specimen collection in the field and the proper scrutiny of these specimens with the microscope in the controlled domestic context. Through the popular discourse of microscopy and aquaria we can thus trace the domestication of the didactic moral impetus of 'Nature' from the field into the parlours, studies and laboratories of Victorian Britain; it will thus be clear how the interests of more traditional naturalists, such as Kingsley, came (ironically) to coincide with those of the 'closet' faction of academic practitioners such as T. H. Huxley. Barber has suggested that naturalists such as Philip Gosse successfully promoted the household aquarium in the 1850s by harnessing it to the recent innovation of the middle- class seaside holiday.45 In his best-selling 1854 work The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Sea, Gosse indeed exhorted readers to collect live specimens and install them in the reconstituted 'natural' environment of their parlour aquarium in order to observe what no naturalist had seen before: the inhabitants of the deep sea have hitherto been almost inaccessible to such observation as this; and hence exceedingly little has been accumulated of their biography... The MARINE AQUARIUM however, bids fair to supply the required opportunities, and to make us acquainted with the strange creatures of the sea without diving to gaze on them.46 Gosse took great pains to emphasize the need for authentic vegetation and sand in maintaining the 'naturalness' of the aquarium environment, but to avoid an untoward elitism in such furnishing he recommended judicious use of his own celebrated recipe for artificial sea-water by those with insufficient leisure and means to reach the sea-shore.47 So effective was this extension of the naturalist's 'field' to the indoor domain that Charles Kingsley, as staunchly opposed to other forms of 'closet' natural history as was Gosse, could argue in Glaucus that 'science has shown, as usual, that by simply obeying nature we can conquer her, even so far as to have our own miniature sea, of artificial salt water, filled with living plants and seaweeds, maintaining each other in perfect health, and each following as far as it is possible in a confined space its natural habits'. 48 Similarly, Wood's The Fresh and Salt Water Aquarium, although published when the fashion for such parlour ornaments was in decline during 1868, claimed for the instrument a unique integrity as an indoor mediator of 'Nature': 'one element of strength in the aquarium ... [is] the study of Nature in one of her hitherto unstudied phases ... we can find in a small vessel of salt or fresh water enough to give us occupation for many a long year, and to disclose 45 Barber, op. cit.

The enormous growth in popular microscopy that coincided with the rise and fall of the aquarium between the 1850s and 1870s has been explained by Olivia Brown as an interactive result of three co-extensive social phenomena: first, the burgeoning manufacture of cheap instruments, for example Field &amp; Son's microscopes which bore the specific commendation of the Society of Arts from 1855 onwards and ranged from under lOs 6d for schools, and under 3 guineas for students and teachers; secondly, the popularizing activities of specialist organizations such as the Microscopical Society and the Quekett Club, which held frequent soirees and public exhibitions, for example the spectacular 'Conversazione' held at the Apothecaries' Hall in 1855;5? thirdly, the wide diffusion of popular scientific journals promoting microscopy, for example Science Gossip and the Quarterly Review of Science were major sources of practical advice on the microscope purchase and practice for those unable to use expensive specialist textbooks by Quekett, Carpenter and Beale." To augment the popular journal literature on microscopy, various eminent authors produced populist elementary guides to the practice of microscopy as further alternatives to such weighty tomes. All were designed to capture the incipient public interest in the microscope and to inculcate an orderly appreciation of its proper use. Ironically as with the case of the aquarium, it was the most vociferous opponents of closet natural history that became the most successful popularizers of microscopy through their attempts to license it as a legitimate auxiliary to field-work's autonomous discipline. Thus Philip Gosse's Evening with the Microscope, Edwin Lankester's Half-Hours with the Microscope (1859), Rev. J. G. Wood's Common Objects of the Microscope (1861), ranked in popularity with various works by the Hon. Mrs Mary Ward.52 All attempted to legislate upon the proper ideology and practice of microscopy particularly emphasizing the veracity and accessibility of the microscope to all potential users. Thus, for example, in the preface to her 1869 edition of The Microscope, Mrs Ward signalled to her readers that they should suspend all scepticism about the microscope as a mediator of 'Nature'. She related an anecdote concerning a working man who had come to her 'half shily and half pleased' to look through her microscope at some 'striking object'. Readers were told that upon seeing the unfamiliar image through the eyepiece he 'gazed attentively for a moment, and then exclaimed in considerable surprise, "It is 49 Rev. J. G.

It is like visiting a rich but hitherto undiscovered region.'53 In more specific terms, Mrs Ward attempted to win the credulity of these audiences by showing how this 'region' of 'Nature' accessible only to the microscope was indeed a continuous extension from the field into the indoor environment - a continuity that implicitly conferred a 'natural' legitimacy upon microscopy practised indoors (Figure 3). Of the spate of popular microscopy texts produced in the period 1858-61, Edwin Lankester's popular 1859 work Half-Hours with the Microscope, was framed in a very specific discourse of domestication. Lankester articulated this privileged status of the home environment by a narrative structure of 'half-hours' devoted to microscopy in a linked sequence of environments that both began and ended in the domestic setting. Commencing with a 'half-hour on the structure of the microscope' in which readers were directed to commence operations on their parlour table, in the following chapter Lankester invited his audience through their back-door to spend 'a half-hour with the microscope in the garden' 53 Ward, The Microscope, 3rd edn, 1869, p. vi.</page><page sequence="17">'Nature' in the laboratory 323 to scrutinize 'the external surfaces of the parts of all plants which afford a rich field of amusement and instruction for the microscopic observer'. 54 Moving next out of the urban domain to spend a 'half-hour ... in the country', Lankester commented that 'a compound microscope is not easily conveyed and set up in the field, but the produce of the roads and waysides may be easily brought to the microscope at home'. Thus he exhorted his readers that 'no-one who has a microscope should walk into the country without supplying himself with a few small boxes, three or four small bottles, and a hand net, in order to bring home objects for examination' - an unambiguous statement of the hierarchical subordination of field technology and practice to domestic microscopy. This hierarchy was reiterated after further half-hour excursions to 'fresh-water' and the 'sea-side', for as Lankester put it 'when the rain is falling, and the sea-side forsaken, and the country miserable looking, we can still enjoy the long winter evenings with our microscope in the house...'; indeed during the last half-hour 'with the microscope indoors' readers returned to the domestic environment and were told that 'for amusement and instruction with the microscope we need scarcely stir out of our rooms. The very hair on our head may be made objects of interesting investigation'. 55 Wood argued similarly in his widely read Common Objects of the Microscope that although individuals 'gifted with a thorough appreciation of nature' were not always at liberty to 'range the seashore' or 'traverse the fields and woods', any committed naturalist could 'find an endless series of common objects for his microscope within the limits of the tiniest city chamber '.56 A major characteristic of such popular literature was the ubiquitous use of the ' Nature' and 'field' motifs to identify respectively the subject matter and the territorial domain of domestic microscopy. Thus the Rev. J. B. Reade, with his authority as President of the Royal Microscopical Society, told readers of the Popular Science Review that the microscope 'was in every respect well-calculated to exhibit all we want to know about an object we can neither see nor touch ... among Nature's invisibilia'; the Hon. Mrs Ward in her widely read The Microscope exhorted her readers in similar vein to use the instrument to 'feast [their] eyes on ... specimens of Nature's mosaic work'.57 Furthermore in the rhetoric of Wood's epigraph cited above we see an egalitarian subtext in his portrayal of even the most modest cheap microscopes as instruments rendering 'the secrets of Nature' accessible to enthusiasts of all social registers. As a functional replacement for the bucolic 'field' in the discourse of the outdoor naturalist, the term 'field' served rhetorically to delineate for microscopists a legitimate domain of enquiry, for example Cuthbert Collingwood's reference in his 1862 article 'The microscope; with directions for its use' to the 'the boundless field of minute organic life', and Gosse's allusion to the 'vast field of marvels' open to the microscopist.58 The use of 54 E.

Collingwood thus emphasized the role of the 'field-lens' or 'field-glass' (that complemented the object lens) in the eyepiece in controlling the size of the image to bring all of it within the 'field of vision '.60 Not only did this displaced discourse serve the interests of practitioners in legitimating an extension of microscopical territory: it also enabled activists in the BAAS to disseminate their practices by mediating them through themes of orderly democratic reform. Such an enlistment was effected by George Rolleston, Oxford Professor of Anatomy and Physiology, in addressing Section D of the BAAS in 1870; arguing for Goodsir's amalgamation of the aquarium and microscope as a primary vehicle of cognitive emancipation, Rolleston said The microscope has done very much ... in enabling all persons to obtain the necessary minimum of practical acquaintance with the arrangements of the natural world ... The glass trough used in Edinburgh, the invention of John Goodsir ... can be made into a miniature aquarium (I purposely use a word which calls up the idea of an indoors apparatus, wishing thereby to show how the means I recommend are within the reach of all persons); and in it ... animal and vegetable organisms can be observed at any and at all hours, and with tolerably high magnifying powers even whilst undisturbed. Thus is gained an admirable field for the self-discipline in question.61 As a counter-theme to the presentation of microscopy as an egalitarian and domesticated extension of natural history, we can also pinpoint strongly normative elements in the narrative of these populist texts that belie the political interests of the authors. Wood, Gosse and Collingwood used their popular texts to show their audiences how to see 'Nature' through the microscope by signposting specific sequences of subjects to study, along with engraving and prints of the images that readers should see through the eyepiece and hints as to techniques necessary to produce such images. In Evenings with the Microscope Gosse steered his audience away from the anarchy that would result from exposure to the highly divergent observations of rival treatises into following his putatively 'objective' agenda of discovery: ... respecting many of the subjects which came under his notice, [the author] found in endeavouring to reproduce and verify published statements, so much perplexity and difficulty that he was thrown back upon himself and nature, compelled to observe de novo, and to set down simply[sic] what he himself could see... [consequently] the student who shall have verified for himself the observations here detailed, will no longer by a tyro in microscopic science, and will be well prepared to extend his independent researches.62 59 Wood, op. cit.

George Rolleston identified this strategy in beginners' microscopy as a guarantee against the didactically subversive recording of artefactual observations: If a subject is to act educationally ... it must form one segment or stretch in a continuous chain of known facts ... you must start from some previously existing basis of knowledge, and keep your communication with it uninterrupted if your knowledge is not to be unreal ... [My] advice [is] that no sudden jump be made from observations carried on with the naked eye to observations carried on with the highest powers of the microscope... I am speaking of course of the course to be pursued by a beginner... Unless he ascends by gradations from organs and systems to structures and tissues and cells, [the student's] wonder and admiration at the results of the ultimate microscope analysis, of what he had but a moment before knowledge of only in the concrete and by the naked eye, is likely to be but unintelligent.63 In learning how to see the instrumentally-mediated microscopic 'reality' that was so vulnerably remote from naked-eye observation, Wood emphasized the importance of the tacit knowledge: '[by] the examination of a single object with increasing powers of a simple microscope the observer will find that he has gained more than he would have by volumes of reading alone'. Wood's political interest in recommending the pursuit of ever higher magnification is clear from his moralism that he knew of 'no pursuit more fascinating than this, or more calculated to make him who pursues it forgetful of time, place, hunger and cold. There is something so entrancing in the manner in which Nature gives up her wondrous secrets that the mind seems to be entirely taken out of the world. '64 In cultivating the expanding public culture of microscopy we can see how practitioners aligned popular practice with the interests of the incumbent political regime by the expediency of keeping both 'Nature' and its microscopical audience in an orderly indoor environment - removed from the potential outdoor strife and disorder that was so repugnant to the ruling classes. Olivia Brown has alluded to such an attempt to enlist household microscopy as a vehicle of social order with respect to the regimentation of working-class leisure, citing W. B. Carpenter's 1856 pronouncement that encouraging the 'Labouring population' to undertake microscopical study at home would 'keep it free from that grovelling sensuality in which it too frequently looses litself'.65 Such canvassing for microscopy as a normalizing domestic diversion from vice, insurgency or hardship was a gambit deployed again in the inter-related political, educational and industrial debates of 1867-68. In early 1868 an article in The Student and Intellectual Observer entitled 'The microscope in education'66 heralded domestic microscopy as the ideal medium for relieving fears of social instability caused by the substantial enfranchisement of the population by 63 BAAS Report, (1870), pt 2, p. 93; emphasis added. 64 Wood, op. cit.

The article also proclaimed the microscope as the ideal means of effecting widespread scientific education as a mass remedy for the sudden collapse of British industrial prestige in the aftermath of the International Exhibition held in Paris during the spring of 1867.67 ' On all hands the active members of society ... are busied with the great question of national education', began the article, but whilst making passing reference to 'improving' middle-class liberal education, it specifically emphasized that 'the education of the working classes specially occupies the minds of many social reformers'. Whilst more 'materialistic' individuals wished for the 'prompt diffusion' of working-class education 'chiefly that we may more effectually compete with foreign manufacturers in the career of skilled production and in the race for wealth', others, it continued, with an eye to political interests, and the bearings of democratic change, consider that national safety depends on national instruction, and they believe that as the number of those who contribute to make that irresistible force called 'public opinion' is rapidly increasing by the admission as actors of ... large classes formerly excluded, it is absolutely essential that the new- comers should be qualified for the functions that they have to perform... 8 Assuming that scientific instruction would inevitably 'form an essential portion of the education of the future' it continued by prescribing one specific instrument as the proper vehicle for inculcating moral responsibility in this new portion of the electorate: the possession of at least a moderate amount of philosophical apparatus will be regarded as necessary by all families raised sufficiently above want to afford its purchase, and the most popular and available instrument is assuredly a microscope, from the range of information it is able to impart, and from the continuous pleasure so easily procurable from its use... With the aid of a microscope, and a few well selected preparations, sound elementary knowledge of the nature of bones, muscles, nerves, lungs, skin, etc. may be obtained and the ideas thus communicated will not only enlarge the mind but furnish useful hints for practical conduct all through life ... directing the microscope to readily accessible plants [and] seeing them properly exhibited under the microscope rarely fails to instruct and delight.69 The message concerning the virtues of microscopy was unambiguous and taken to be consensual: 'It will be conceded by all acquainted with the matter, that a course of microscopic instruction of the kind indicated should be regarded as an indispensable feature in every civilized educational scheme.'70 From the epigraphic citation of Bowerbank above and from the testimony of Brown et al., there is strong evidence that large indoor audiences were recruited for microscopy from the late 1850s by the wide deployment of these literary and political strategies.71 Having seen how this instrument was translated into the domains of the academic 'closet' naturalists, we must now examine how the microscope was employed by these practitioners in their 'civilized' schemes for teaching particular sections of the public constituencies how to study 'Nature' indoors. Such schemes burgeoned in the 1860s and 1870s and we will now consider how two of the early expert practitioners publicly rendered the microscope a reliable and 'transparent' mediator of 'Nature'.

SKILL AND CONVENTION IN MANAGING A DOMESTIC TECHNOLOGY OF'NATURE' Now the telescope and microscope are additional eyes, and before they can be aright employed on the objects with which the astronomer and anatomist have to do, a supplementary education must be submitted to (an education the more irksome that the other senses cannot be employed to interpret the revelations of the new instrument) in order that the minute structures on the one hand and the heavenly bodies on the other may be correctly examined. John Goodsir, Introductory lecture to Edinburgh University students of anatomy, 1846.72 Academic concerns over the propriety of the microscope as an instrument of education were intense in the middle of the nineteenth century. Conventional histories of microscope technology stress only the significance of problems solved by J. J. Lister during the 1820s in eliminating chromatic and spherical aberration from the construction of 'true' lenses for compound microscopes.73 Yet whilst Lister's system of multiple lens combination was generally introduced to the manufacture of compound microscopes by opticians by the 1830s, it is evident from the testimony of one of Henry Acland's students in Oxford during the 1840s that the integrity and authenticity of microscopic imagery were still vulnerable to academic scepticism. Writing of Acland's instruction in microscopical histology as Lee's reader of anatomy, William Tuckwell recollected of his undergraduate days between 1848 and 1852: A few senior men came in from time to time, but could not force their minds into the new groove. Dr Ogle, applying his eye to microscope, screwed a quarter inch right through the object; and Dr Kidd after examining some delicate morphological preparation, while [Acland] explained its meaning, made answer first that he did not believe it, and secondly, if it were true he did not think God meant us to know it.74 Evidently individuals who had not been inculcated in Goodsir's 'supplementary education' in how to procure and interpret microscopical evidence could easily contest the veracity of the microscope notwithstanding the technological refinement that Lister's achromatic condenser lenses had conferred upon the instrument. Acceptance of the microscope as a 'transparent' mediator of 'Nature' required an education in both operational skills and procedural conventions of what counted as 'natural' in microscopy. To illustrate this thesis I shall draw upon the two major canonical texts for microscopy between the 1850s and 1880s: How to Work with the Microscope by Lionel Beale, Professor of Physiology at King's College, London from 1853 to 1869; and The Microscope and its Revelations by William Carpenter, Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal 72 J.

Beale's class microscope, How to Work with the Microscope, p. 14. Institution and Professor of Forensic Medicine at University College, London from 1844 to 1856.75 In these texts both authors codified microscopical methods which they had employed or observed in lectures and classroom teaching. Beale's method for introducing students to the techniques of 'seeing' with the microscope began in the context of the lecture theatre, a setting in which he could exercise a high level of control over the visual and oral inputs to student cognition - just as Faraday had done in lectures to his public audiences at the Royal Institution. His method was one that drew upon the example of John Quekett's professorial lectures in histology at the Royal College of Surgeons in the 1840s: Quekett equipped each tier of his lecture theatre with a microscope mounted with its own lamp on a sliding tray that could be circulated from student to student without materially affecting the slide-preparation that had been fixed to the instrument by Quekett's assistant prior to the lecture. In his physiology lectures at King's College during the 1860s, Beale employed a communal microscope that was locked, however, in a rigid internal configuration - instead of being regimented by a railed circuit - so that it could be passed from each student to the next by hand.76 The instrument he used for this purpose was an adaptation of the robust 'Pocket Microscope' he himself had devised for use in the diverse environments of laboratory, field and hospital ward, the adaptation being the incorporation of a robust stand to safeguard the didactic stability of its 'output' against the contingencies of student handling (Figure 4)." As Carpenter explained: The object having been fixed in its place, and the coarse adjustment made by sliding the body in the outer tube, these parts may then be immovably secured, and nothing need be left movable except the eye-tube, by sliding which in or out the fine adjustment [in focusing] may be affected. Thus the whole apparatus may be passed from hand to hand with the greatest facility, and 75 L. Beale, How to Work with the Microscope, 4th edn, London, 1868; W.

One of Beale's alternative modes for controlled communal instruction in elementary microscopy was the octagonal arrangement shown in Figure 5. The advantage he again claimed for this arrangement in class teaching was that 'while every one can alter the focus to suit his vision[,] the preparation and light are quite out of his reach', the directionalized configuration of student observers around the same source further serving to normalize the image 'readings' amongst the microscopical tyros.79 In both set-ups Beale simultaneously furnished his students with the 'correct' discourse with which to describe the microscopical specimens that they encountered during their communal observation. Indeed he preached that combining demonstrative and oral elements in microscopical teaching was essential to counteract the 'far too prevalent' opinion that it is only necessary to place an object in the field of the microscope in order to make out its structure ... any one who has had experience in microscopical enquiry knows how difficult it is to prove that what he sees is really the thing as it is in nature, and not a mere fanciful interpretation of his own. This all-too prevalent lack of orthodox training amongst beginners in how to interpret what they saw in the field was, Beale intimated, the source of 'much of the disappointment' suffered in their independent efforts at microscopy.80 78 Carpenter, op. cit.

Developed collectively, these skills conferred upon the microscopist a privileged 'instinct' for investigation that rendered his observational results as unequivocally 'natural'. Carpenter especially emphasized the manipulative skill required when substituting one objective lens for another without 'damaging' or 'disturbing' the integrity of the mounted object; of the recommended procedure for risk-free lens substitution he commented 'when it is habitually practised ... it becomes so much like "an acquired instinct" as to be almost invariably practised in other cases'. With regard to the use of natural sunlight to illuminate specimens, for example, Carpenter warned 'tyros' that coloured diffraction effects were liable to lead them into the 'misinterpretation of appearances' even when 'the very best instruments are employed'. Stressing the tacit, i.e. non-articulable, component in deploying the requisite skills of interpretation, Carpenter declared that 'no rules can be given for the avoidance of such errors, since they can only be escaped by the discriminative power which education and habit confer. The practised Microscopist, indeed, almost instinctively makes the requisite allowance for diffraction.'81 Most information in Beale's account of interpretative and manual skills as essential elements in the 'transparent' portrayal of 'Nature' lies in his discussion of recording observations made at the eyepiece of the microscope. Of the acquisition of the necessary skills he warned the student that: 'it is quite as impossible to obtain a good representation of any microscopic object without long and careful study, as it is to produce a copy of any other object in nature'. But what criterion could be chosen to establish the fidelity of a drawing to 'Nature'? Beale privileged the criterial convention of accuracy: 'an accurate copy, although it be very roughly executed has an aspect of truth which is unmistakeable, while a drawing which is the offspring of the imagination instead of a simple copy of nature, bears the mark of untruth in every line, however elaborate ... its execution may be'. 82 With respect to the conventional character of accurate measurement as a criterion of authentic naturality it is important to recall that Gosse had criticized this sort of activity in his attack on closet naturalists in 1851. For Gosse, 'Nature' was not to be found by measuring 'limbs, members and organs' and recording the results 'in thousandths of an inch', but rather in the holistic appreciation of the living organism in its natural habitat.83 Although thus contestable from the perspective of the traditional field naturalist, this criterion of accuracy had the didactic advantage that it was readily implemented by comparative measurement between a student's drawing and an orthodox standard, whereas - as Beale emphasized - no such comparison was possible for merely verbal accounts of microscopical observation.84 Hence from an educational view the accuracy of a student's drawings was the aspect of microscopical pedagogy most readily normalized by the laboratory instructor. This normalization was effected by attaching a micrometer to the 81 Carpenter, op. cit. (75), pp. 147, 164-6. 82 Beale, op. cit. (75), pp. 33-4. 83 See Gosse, op. cit. (27). 84 Beale, op. cit.

In addition to such conventionalized skills, what further conventions of technical practice were required to render the microscope a 'transparent' mediator of 'Nature'? Beale's attachment of the wooden base to create this 'demonstrating' microscope was typical of material techniques employed to minimize the effect of human behaviour on the instrument's mediation of 'Nature'. Robustness of construction was indeed generally emphasized as a prerequisite to all microscopes in order to maintain not only verisimilitude, but also a receptive audience for the discipline. As The Student and Intellectual Observer reported in 1868: A microscope that will not show all ordinary objects well, bringing out their beauty, as well as their structure, will soon be voted a tiresome and unsatisfactory machine ... the instrument must be steady and whatever motions it may have must be reasonably smooth... Many cheap microscopes are so constructed that when the great screws are worked to bring the body up or down, they must wabble and jerk, defects which will get worse and worse the more things are used. The fine adjustment should be tested in the same way. If it makes the object appear to move about on the stage, it will be a perpetual plague.86 Readers were given a strong moral imperative against parsimonious inclinations to purchase cheap instruments liable to such artefactual renditions of 'Nature': 'Families should not too readily begrudge the price of a good microscope ... it is not a little barbarous [otherwise] to find costly finery in a house destitute of appliances for the cultivation of the mind.'87 Carpenter and Beale recommended further implementation of structural devices to isolate human disturbances that jeopardized the 'natural' operation of the microscope. In Carpenter's discussion of the 'management of the microscope' he exhorts the reader to place the instrument on a table 'whose steadiness is such as to allow of his arms being rested upon it without any yielding; it should, moreover, be so framed, as to be free as possible from any tendency to transmit the vibrations of the building or of the floor whereon it stands'. 88 An allied device for the controlled 'naturalization' of the microscope's working environment concerned the illumination of its 'field of view'. All authors prescribed the use of 'natural' daylight rather than artificial light whenever possible, Beale reporting that 'it has been said with truth that microscopical work should be undertaken only by day, since the most perfect artificial light which can be obtained is far inferior to daylight for delicate observation'. Carpenter thus stressed that the microscope used in daytime should be placed close to a window that communicated indirect reflected sunlight to the microscope stage, thereby replicating the natural illumination employed by the microscopists out in the 'field'. For the large constituency of domestic naturalists who could only practise 85 Beale, op. cit. (75), pp. 35-41; Carpenter, op. cit. (75), pp. 93-102. 86 'The microscope in education', op. cit.

Whilst being prepared as 'natural', such mounted slide-preparations also had to be permanently stabilized and during the 1850s and 1860s these two desiderata were met by a multitude of physico-chemical techniques, such as injection, staining, mounting in resin etc. Thomas Davies, for example, in his popular text On Mounting Microscopical Objects, catalogued the staining agents that differentially highlighted specific tissue cell structures, for example acetic acid, concentrated sulphuric acid, tannin, lime water, ammonia; hardening agents, softening agents, solvents, polarized light, electricity, heat and moisture. Like many other authors, Davies placed a particularly high premium on the qualities of 'Canada Balsam' as a quite literally 'transparent' preservative medium for zoological and botanical preparations that had been dessicated by heating.90 These methods were none the less problematic since the 'natural' status of a slide- preparation by any particular technique was open to dispute: no independent test was available - or in Goodsir's terms no other senses could be employed - to ratify that the 'revelations' obtained with this technique were 'natural' and not 'artefactual'. Brian Bracegirdle has indeed argued that the development of microtechnique in the nineteenth century proceeded by 'rule-of-thumb' investigation, and from Bracegirdle's catalogue of such tests we can infer that the legitimacy of each technique was subject to ongoing expert debate.9' These debates produced an evolving body of conventions as to what constituted a stable and 'natural' preparation for each microscopic subject; that a high level of consensus was reached about the propriety of these specific agents can be seen in the very similar accounts given of physico-chemical techniques in textbooks such as those of Beale, Carpenter and Davies.92 Nevertheless, the occasional voice of dissent on such usages highlights for the historian the purely conventional status of such techniques as 'natural': Davies, for example, cites a division of views upon the optimum preparation of mollusc tongues. Mr Edwards of New York, 'no mean authority', was reported as recommending that after immersing the tongue in alcohol for preservative purposes it be boiled a short time in turpentine and then 'put up in Canada balsam'. By contrast a Mr May was reported as expressing himself as " standing utterly aghast" at any man so interfering with nature as to put up these objects in balsam, thus pressing and destroying their true forms', recommending instead a 'weak 89 Beale, op. cit.

Beale himself was occasionally sceptical about the authenticity of Canada Balsam preparations, for example specimens preserved with 'transparent injections' of carmine fluid. As he wrote gravely in How to Work with the Microscope: although many of these specimens are very beautiful, I am not aware that new facts have been revealed by the process. As the specimens are mounted in balsam, the structure of the tissues external to the vessels is completely lost. Moreover the vessels with the contained injection have become much reduced by the process of drying, and generally the appearances seen cannot be regarded as natural.94 Collectively speaking, then, the use of microtechniques, natural lighting, stable working surfaces and robust mobile instrumentation were conventions employed by microscopists to effect a controlled 'naturalization' of their domestic working environment. These techniques, when 'properly' employed, served the purpose of minimizing the apparent artificiality and situational idiosyncracies of the indoor location; so that whilst socially constructing the 'natural' conditions, practitioners, students and domestic readers of pedagogical texts could claim a direct, i.e. unmediated, contact with 'Nature'. We can now consider how T. H. Huxley applied such conventions to a select portion of the public constituency for microscopy in his innovative laboratory teaching of biology at South Kensington in the 1870s. 'NATURE' AND DISCIPLINED LABORATORY MICROSCOPY FOR THE TRAINEE TEACHER It had long been felt by those who annually examined teachers and pupils for certificates in various branches of science, under the Science and Art Department, that the candidates displayed a sad want of practical acquaintance with the subjects in which they presented themselves for examination; many showed considerable ability and great book knowledge, but a knowledge of the things themselves with which science deals, a proof of personal intercourse with Nature, which after all is the only foundation of scientific knowledge ... was to a very great extent wanting ... the only way to meet this difficulty was to find teachers who had the requisite familiarity with 'the solid ground of Nature' and set them to work to leaven the mass. The readiest means of doing this was undoubtedly that adopted by the authorities - namely to summon to a central class the ablest of the teachers at present distributed throughout the kingdom, and to impart to them as much practical acquaintance and personal familiarity with the things of which they had read in books as was possible in a given time. By annual repetition there can be little doubt that the body of science teachers throughout the country would be materially affected... After passing through such a course of instruction ...[teachers would be able] ... to teach, not at second hand, but from experience, not as fluent repeating machines, but as thoughtful students of phenomena. E. R. Lankester, 'Instruction to science teachers at South Kensington', in Nature, September 1871.95 Gerald Geison and Stella Butler have shown that a distinctive culture of laboratory physiology was ascendant in the universities, colleges and hospital schools of Britain from about 1870. Geison has explained this as a consequence of the new statutes for medical 93 Davies, op. cit. (90), p. 173. 94 Beale, op. cit. (75), p. 91. 95 E.

Whilst noting that physiological teaching laboratories such as Foster's borrowed much from Continental traditions and from the local British culture of physical and chemical laboratories it is important to note that much of Foster's expertise in the effective teaching of microscopy etc. derived from his experiences as a demonstrator in T. H. Huxley's biological laboratory from 1871.97 Several scholars have commented upon the role of Huxley's South Kensington laboratory as a model of effective practical teaching in botany and physiology that was exported to other academic institutions in the 1870s and 1880s through the mediation of former demonstrators such as Foster, William Rutherford, E. Ray Lankester, W. T. Thistleton-Dyer and S. H. Vines.98 However, none has shown how Huxley's well- disciplined scheme of practical biology drew upon the techniques of microscopical pedagogy developed by Quekett, Beale and Carpenter; nor have they considered the contextual significance of targetting such a scheme at lower-class audiences. This concluding section of my analysis will draw together themes from the preceding discussion by showing how Huxley et al. inculcated Department of Science and Art (DSA) school teachers in the manual and discursive skills of biological microscopy that enabled them to bring 'Nature' to the school teachers of industrial Britain. As I have discussed elsewhere, T. H. Huxley was a national examiner in the life sciences for the DSA, the examinations of which served chiefly to qualify teachers employed in schools under the aegis of the DSA to teach subjects outside the standard curriculum of the 'three Rs'.99 Huxley's fellow examiners were Edward Frankland in chemistry and (John Tyndall replaced in 1869 by) Frederick Guthrie in physics, and all were additionally employed by the Government at the Royal School of Mines or the affiliated Royal College of Chemistry. As experimentalists, the institutional interests of Huxley, Guthrie and Frankland were served by re-orienting the examinations away from a traditional literary foundation upon canonical texts towards a practical knowledge of their subjects, a move for which they drew much support from the post-Paris Exhibition debates upon the economic utility of practical scientific education for the British industrial classes.'00 96 G.

Huxley commented similarly of the DSA examination in physiology, 'there is abundant evidence, every year, of cramming. There are certain kinds of gross cramming (when, for instance, answers to questions thought likely to be put are committed to memory, and when, therefore, the same answers will be given almost verbatim by all the members of one class) which can very easily be detected and punished. It is possible by judicious framing of the questions, to defeat attempts at cramming, to a considerable extent. 403 In 1869 Huxley enlisted 'Nature' as a powerful cultural ally in order to convey the same messages more directly to the industrial population that was the source of most of the Department's examinees.104 To the Liverpool Philomathic Society Huxley thus argued that a student who was the product of a conventional literary schooling was: devoid of all apprehension of scientific conceptions, not only did [he] ... fail to attach any meaning to the words 'matter', 'force', or law in their scientific senses, but worse still [a pupil has] no notion of what it is to come into contact with Nature... His whole mind has been given to books, and I am hardly exaggerating if I say they are more real to him than Nature. He imagines that all knowledge can be got out of books, and rests upon the authority of some master or other... If scientific training is to yield its most eminent results it must ... be made practical. That is to say, in explaining to a child the general phenomena of Nature, you must, as far as possible, give reality to your teaching by object-lessons; in teaching him botany, he must handle the plants and dissect the plants for himself... and especially tell him that it is his duty to doubt until he is compelled by the absolute authority of Nature to believe that which is written in books.105 R.

Thus on 11 March 1869 the Lords of the Committee of Council on Education agreed to furnish Huxley, Frankland and Guthrie with the resources to give practically-oriented instruction to DSA registered teachers. In the summer of 1869 T. H. Huxley and Michel Foster gave a course of evening lectures on animal physiology at the Royal School of Mines 'specially meant to instruct teachers in the art of teaching, making their experiments, etc.'.106 Nevertheless, Huxley's and Guthrie's evening lectures were not given facilities to provide practical work for the teachers in question and Geison has pointed out that the summer courses for laboratory instruction in biology (also for physics) were initiated at South Kensington only with the financial support of the Liberal Minister for Education, W. E. Forster, in the summer of 1871; Forster sanctioned these courses in late 1870 as a means of qualifying school teachers to meet the expanding system of primary school instruction that he had inaugurated earlier in the year with his Education Bill.'07 Although the function of the South Kensington six-week summer course and its clientele thus contrasted strongly with the two terms of clinical instruction in practical physiology and anatomy that were required of medical students at other institutions, the emphasis upon skills in microscopy was very similar. This is clear first from Huxley's apportioning of the budget that was approved by the Lords of the Committee of Council in January 1871 for a projected forty-five trainee teachers: Professor - ?200 Assistant - ?120 Two Demonstrators - ?200 Tables - ? 30 15 microscopes - ?100 Materials - ?100108 By the time that the course began in June 1871, however, although Huxley's position as professor in charge was unchanged, the hierarchy beneath him was changed to become three equally paid demonstrators: William Rutherford, professor of physiology at King's College, London; Michael Foster, praelector in physiology at Trinity College, Cambridge; and E. Ray Lankester, a recent Natural Sciences graduate and Radcliffe Travelling Fellow of Christchurch, Oxford.'09 Further, only thirty-nine applicant teachers were selected to join the course and after further financial readjustment it would appear that about twenty microscopes were purchased so that each could be shared between pairs instead of threes ;110 the strategic significance of these changes will shortly become clear. 106 218 teachers attended Huxley's lectures, 204 Guthrie's course on physics and 153 undertook laboratory chemistry with Frankland.

Given Huxley's somewhat controversial reputation at the time'1' and the social origins of his audience of trainee teachers in a class so recently and controversially enfranchised, I would suggest that it was of paramount importance to Huxley to establish an orderly scheme of training. In Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish we find a theory of how socio-cognitive discipline is institutionally maintained by four powerful devices of 'correct training': simple instruments, a hierarchy of observation, normalized judgement and regular examinations."2 My argument is that Huxley, Rutherford, Foster and Lankester used these devices to exercise closure over the students' interpretative interaction with 'Nature' as follows: (i) the simple instrument employed was primarily the microsope - simple in being by convention a 'transparent' mediator of 'Nature' when operated with skill according to the orthodox conventions of 'natural' usage; (ii) the hierarchy of observation effected was constituted by Huxley's lecture definitions of what students were meant to see through the microscope and in related dissections and the subsequent surveillance by his demonstrators to ensure that students 'saw' precisely this; (iii) a normalized judgement over microscopical observations was exercised by a systematic social organization of students, the rigid timetabling of the student's day in the laboratory, and the use of micrometric measurements to quantify results of microscopical observation in an examinable fashion; (iv) the examination was constituted by demonstrators' vigilant marking of entries in the student's laboratory notebooks to ensure that only 'correct' results were recorded and inculcated into the students' working practices. I shall show how these four devices collectively can be identified with Delamont and Atkinson's desiderata of experimental 'stage-management' and 'discourse-limitation'. E. R. Lankester's retrospective account of the first six-week course from June to July in 1871 reveals all of these features, the detail of which can usefully be augmented by reference to the canonical textbook published in 1875 from the teaching experience of Huxley with his demonstrators and his assistant H. N. Martin in A Course of Instruction in Elementary Biology. 13 111 For Huxley's concern to avoid controversy on evolutionary matters in his teaching see the correspondence reproduced in J. A.

Martin, A Course of Instruction in Elementary Biology, Cambridge, 1875.</page><page sequence="32">338 Graeme Gooday As Lankester related in Nature of September 1871 the selected teachers attended the newly built South Kensington laboratory for six days a week from 10 a.m. until 4.30 p.m. - or 2 p.m. on Saturdays. First on the agenda at 10 a.m. was a lecture from Huxley on the day's 'form of life' or 'type' selected from the continuous scale of botanical and zoological species from yeast to rabbit, a system which was initiated by Huxley as a concise mode of teaching what he designated 'biology'. Having been told in Huxley's lecture what were the relevant microscopical observations and dissections to make and how to interpret their appearance, students were immediately brought into the adjacent laboratory and set to work on a pre-prepared specimen of the 'form of life'. Lankester tellingly remarked that students proceeded with microscope and dissection equipment 'in illustration of, or rather as a sequel to, the lecture which they had just heard'."14 In the laboratory the trainee teachers were grouped at large steady tables significantly placed in pairs such that each member of a pair had alternate use of the microscope and dissecting equipment. Whilst nominally a device for economical laboratory management, such sharing also served the implicit normative function of each worker checking the result of his or her partner to maintain a parity of results; thus both workers jointly undertook the task of ordering, numbering, naming and comparing the somites of a lobster for a presentation inspected and evaluated by a demonstrator. When investigating a species of vertebrata such as a frog or rabbit, the same specimen was used by each worker such that whilst one dissected the other studied the microscopical structure of the various tissues and organs - a situation in which mutual correlation of results would have been unavoidable. Although all students prepared their own microscope slides, the standard techniques of staining, sectioning and embedding were learnt under the supervision of the demonstrator; furthermore each of the magnifications available from the 1-inch and 8-inch objective lenses thus shared was issued with a correlated eyepiece that was furnished with a suitably calibrated micrometric ruling. Students could thereby measure dimensions of subjects in the 'field' that they had been primed by Huxley's lecture to observe there in order to record accurate drawings in their laboratory notebooks."15 From the account of the course published in 1875 by Huxley and Martin we can see how this 'priming' operated with respect to microscopical teaching. In the preface to the Course of Instruction in Elementary Biology, Huxley wrote that a description of each 'type' was 'followed by such detailed instructions as, it is hoped, will enable the student to know, of his own knowledge, the chief facts mentioned...'. The successive stages of such regimented learning in encountering the first type, yeast, involved first, observation with a (Hartnack) microscope of a sample without coverslip at a low magnification (2-inch objective), moving, by convention, up to a higher magnification (of 4- or 8-inch objective). After reporting the typical range of cell shapes and dimensional measurements, Huxley and Martin informed the reader of the structure they should expect to see with regard to sac, protoplasm and vacuole and the relative proportions of each per cell. As a culmination of these morphological investigations the student was then exhorted to produce an accurate depiction of several cells 'drawn carefully to scale'.'16 114 Lankester, op. cit.

The importance of this dense control mechanism can be seen from Lankester's comment, however hyperbolic, that fewer than six of the students had ever used a microscope before, 'still fewer one of adequate power', nor executed a dissection."7 From our citations of Goodsir, Beale and Carpenter above we can infer that an intense transmission of skill from demonstrator to student must have taken place in order to guarantee that such tyros could produce competent results after a six-week course. Indeed this control of the demonstrator over the students' cognitive environment was further augmented after they had completed their day's notebooks since all written reports and drawings, in addition to the abstract of Huxley's lecture, were submitted for what Lankester denoted 'due examination', i.e. the ratification of orthodox results or censorship of deviant results. The outcome of this examination was that the two 'best' students - as judged from scrutiny of them at work in the laboratory and from reports submitted by them - were symbolically awarded microscopes identical to those used in the course."18 Thus we can observe a considerable irony in Lankester's final gloss that however small was the portion of the six-week course that the students subsequently recollected, the advantage they gained was 'something very considerable, for it was something of a new kind, a form of knowledge which they had entirely failed to obtain before'. 19 Although most of the trainee teachers had indeed never experimented for themselves before, it is quite clear that the 'knowledge' they learned was only that which had been authoritatively stage-managed and vigilantly scrutinized by the demonstrators. This is discernible in Foster's retrospective comment that he, Lankester and Rutherford 'did their best to make each member of the class see for himself or herself, so far as was possible, the actual thing of which the master [Huxley] had spoken'*120 We can interpret this reported activity of the demonstrators as an indication of how far Lankester and his colleagues exercised a strict discipline over what the students could legitimately claim to have seen through the microscope. We can thus comprehend how the unfortunate trainee teacher cited in the third epigraph at the start of this paper could easily have experienced strong normalizing forces to depict the subject on his microscope stage precisely as Huxley had drawn it on the blackboard instead of drawing what he 'saw' himself (see above p. 307). What then of the authority of 'Nature' in the laboratory cited by Huxley in opposition to his own didactic expertise? We can get a clue to the identity of this authority from Huxley's description at South Kensington in 1876 of the normalizing forces exercised by laboratory demonstrators through literary and material devices of enforcing 'correct learning': Let me tell you what we do in the biological laboratory which is lodged in a building adjacent to this...

CONCLUSION Now every university of importance and high repute the world over, has a large suite of rooms for each department of science and often numerous great buildings within whose walls thousands and thousands of students are daily brought face to face with the facts and laws of nature ...22 Editorial, 'The laboratory in modern science', Science, 1884. As a study in the domestic practices of mid-nineteenth-century biological microscopy this paper has illustrated the centrality of the Victorian 'Nature' myth as a cultural resource in the de-problematization of laboratory pedagogy in the life sciences. Power-laden Wordsworthian discourses of 'Nature' were enlisted by rival groups - field-based and institution-based naturalists - in attempting to establish that they alone had privileged access to 'Nature'. Field naturalists' denigration of the laboratory study of 'Nature' as artefactual and immoral was, however, qualified in the late 1850s and 1860s by the political expediency of licensing the microscope and the aquarium as legitimate extensions of natural history to the indoor domain. This domestication was supported by a subtle redeployment of the discourse of the 'field of Nature' which presented the microscope to the public as the privileged means of access to knowledge of natural material. Practitioners and teachers of life science tied this displaced discourse to the conventions of 'naturalized' microscopical practice in establishing the literary, disciplinary and instrumental technologies of an autonomous culture of laboratory biology. These technologies were collectively used by Huxley and his colleagues to construe the outcome of their microscopical enquiry to be that of unmediated 'Nature': in the South Kensington scheme of practical instruction in microscopy, 'Nature' was thus as much of a human construct as the working environment of Huxley's laboratory. In the light of this analysis it becomes pertinent to ask how scientific educators operating in other sorts of teaching laboratories succeeded in negotiating the status of their own localized forms of practical knowledge-dissimulation as unproblematic. How did the experimental work that was carried out in the laboratories developed in the 1860s to 1880s for instruction in practical physics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and geology become invulnerable to assertions of artefactuality or un-naturality ?

The social basis of laboratory research cannot adequately be recovered until the preceding laboratory education of researchers has been deconstructed along the lines suggested in this paper. 14-2</page></plain_text>
