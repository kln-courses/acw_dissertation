INNOVATIVE GENIUS: A FRAMEWORK FOR RELATING INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL INTELLIGENCES TO INNOVATION MARY ANN GLYNN Emory University In this article, organizational innovation is viewed as fundamentally cognitive, and the concept of organizational intelligence is developed and related to innovation. Individual and organizational intelligences are conceptualized as being functionally similar (i.e., as purposeful information processing that enables adaptation to environmental de- mands). Organizational intelligence, however, is a social outcome and is related to individual intelligence by mechanisms of aggregation, cross-level transference, and distribution. A conceptual framework is proposed that relates types and levels of intelligence, moderated by contextual factors, to the two stages of the organizational innovation process: initiation and implementation. Implications for research and management are discussed. In its essence, innovation involves intelligence; to put it simply, "An innovation is a new idea" (Van de Ven, 1986: 591). Absent the creative spark of innovative genius or the intelligence of organizational systems that recognize and support innovation, finding new and useful solutions to problems becomes troublesome. Advancing the idea that "[a]t their core, most successful enterprises today can be considered intelligent enter- prises," Quinn (1992: 48) epitomized the growing realization that organiza- tions need to effectively manage their intellectual resources as well as their physical assets. By so doing, organizations enhance their adaptive potential to meet increasingly turbulent and uncertain environmental con- ditions. The role of intelligence in innovation becomes evident when intelli- gence fails innovation, as, for instance, when organizations make routine, noninnovative responses to novel and complex problems (Marcus, 1988), or, conversely, when firms make innovative responses when a routine one would suffice (Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991). Authors have hinted at the role of cognition in fostering innovation. Mezias and Glynn (1993) found that the This article benefited greatly from constructive insights offered by Pamela Barr, Robert Drazin, AMR's five anonymous reviewers, and Susan Jackson; my thanks go to all of them. 1081</page><page sequence="2">1082 Academy of Management Review October amount and type of organizational innovation is related to learning pro- cesses, and Cohen and Levinthal (1990) demonstrated that organizational innovation is dependent upon the organization's knowledge base. Implicit in theories of organizational cognition, such as organizational learning (Senge, 1990), memory (Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991), and sense making (Weick, 1990), is intelligence, for without it an entity cannot learn, remember, or process information effectively. Although cognitive perspectives on orga- nizations have flourished in recent years, researchers have not elaborated on either the nature and function of intelligence in organizations or on its role in affecting innovation. That is the purpose of this article. In the realization that intelligence is "the ability to solve problems, or create products, that are valued within one or more cultural settings" (Gardner, 1993: x) lies its link to organizational innovation, which is defined as novelty that is useful (Amabile, 1988; Kanter, 1983). Figure 1 provides the conceptual framework for this article. The objective is to begin to build a theory that explains the cognitive foundations of organizational innovation. The central idea is that intelligence is embedded in organiza- tions and operates both through individual agents and institutionalized systems to affect organizational innovation. Organizational innovation is based on individual and organizational intelligences, which are moder- ated by contextual factors. Thus, the question of how to make firms more innovative involves the question of how to make firms more intelligent. The framework of Figure 1 is used to organize this analysis of the intelligence- innovation relationship in organizations. INTELLIGENCE IN ORGANIZATIONS: INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL An organization is a body of thought thought by thinking think- ers. (Weick, 1990: 288) Like other cognitive constructs applied to organizations, intelligence can be considered at multiple levels of analysis. Adopting the multilevel framework outlined by Glynn, Lant, and Milliken (1994), I examine intelli- gence at both the individual level and the systemic level; I also consider the interrelationship of these levels. Because I was interested in exploring the relationship between orga- nizational innovation and intelligence, I focus on how intelligence is mani- fested by individuals as members of organizations and by an organization as a collective. Although it is feasible to examine intelligence at other levels of analysis, particularly at the intermediate, meso, or small-group level (e.g., Williams &amp; Sternberg, 1988), setting limits on this exploratory work was necessary. Individual Intelligence In the psychological literature, individual intelligence is conceptual- ized as information-processing capability that is used to solve problems</page><page sequence="3">1996 Glynn 1083 - - - - - - - - - - - - U U 0 a) o 1-4 a) CD -4 1 1-4 4) -4 x I 5 0 0 1 0 0 0 L) 06 C3 &gt;4 0 0 z O I.- 0 u En I 1 4 z 0 0) .0 0 z Cq (1) O T$ =u 0 -; cn &gt; 0 a) 0 0 (i " U -4 ti &gt; 0 &gt; 0 En E- .4 P.. 0 -4 T$ 0 C/) ti tn 93 En -4-4 0 0 (1) u u ...4 P.

Importantly, intelligence requires intentionality (of the actor), and it is flexibly adaptive, not rigidly stereotyped (Cantor &amp; Kihlstrom, 1989). Earlier literature focused on intelli- gence as an individual trait (e.g., Spearman, 1927; Terman, 1916), which consisted of several basic cognitive processes, including perception, learning, encoding, memory, and reasoning. Fundamental to intelligence is expertise, the repertoire of knowledge used to solve problems. This repertoire consists of both declarative knowledge (i.e., factual information, causal beliefs, or perceptual orientations) and procedural knowledge (i.e., the strategies, rules, and skills for acquiring, storing, retrieving, and ma- nipulating declarative knowledge) (Cantor &amp; Kihlstrom, 1989). Although intelligence is generally viewed as purposeful information- processing capability (Barron &amp; Harrington, 1981; Gregory, 1994), there is no consensual definition of the construct for animals, humans, or machines. At present, there are two major-but divergent-approaches to intelligence in the psychological literature: (a) a cognitive or psychometric perspective, which focuses on intelligence as an individual trait, and (b) a contextualist perspective, which focuses on intelligence as a social product, related to the cultural, normative web in which individuals are embedded (Stern- berg, 1985a). These two perspectives differ in their theoretical orientation, levels of analysis, assumptions about the measurement of intellligence, and ways in which differences in intelligence can best be explained; they are outlined in Table 1. Both perspectives are examined in this article, because, taken together, they offer a broader and more comprehensive approach to organizational intelligence. Cognitive or psychometric perspective. According to this perspective, intelligence is conceptualized as an individual's overarching capacity for thinking and problem solving; this "general cognitive ability" is called the g factor (Spearman, 1927). Thus, the main objective of the cognitive perspective has been the development of standardized instruments with which to assess interindividual differences in intelligence; the intelligence quotient (IQ) test eventually became the dominant indicator. In empirical studies on the effects of individual intelligence in work settings, researchers found that intelligence (or general cognitive ability) is an important predictor of task performance, particularly for complex jobs (Gottfredson, 1986; Hunter, 1986). Support for the classic tenet that "Performance = Motivation x Ability" (Campbell, 1976) was demonstrated in several studies. In a longitudinal survey of 105 MBA graduates, O'Reilly and Chatman (1994) found that together intelligence and hard work af- fected job performance and career success. Similarly, Wright, Kacmar, McMahan, and Deleeuw (1995), in their study of 203 warehousers, demon- strated that cognitive ability had significant main and interaction effects (with personality) on the development of work-related knowledge and performance. Ree, Carretta, and Teachout (1995) found that cognitive abil- ity directly affected the acquisition of job knowledge and indirectly af- fected work performance. Thus, there is considerable empirical validation</page><page sequence="5">1996 Glynn 1085 &gt; ~~~a)-. a a) a). a)0 o a)~~C Ua a)~~~~~~~~~~~a a) u, rn 80 0 2 024 o)-~i )- &gt;~ .5 - - 7_ 0 0 a O c' s .33 X4 0 - 0&gt; a1) oUn o0 En0 o04 CD -.O0 :4 - Q) - 4 o ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~g 01 30~ 0 ~~~~~~i~~~o~~~~S~&gt;40 &gt; &gt; CO 0 0 0 ) 0) 0 - o0) a)) 0 - o1 0~~~~~~~~~~~ C x4 .011)~~~~~~ - 0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~E ~~~ ID~~~~~ ~~71 a) 0 u - U, .0)C CD 0'~ -.. a)) 7 -. 0 0 n 0u.0) 0 o 4 00, &gt;~ a) U U) 1) O 0 0 0 -0 '- on a),a .5 .0 - C 0 U-.u -4 - 0.-u2 .0- 04 ..0 0 0 .5 &gt;0 0 1 0 I I 0U 00. 0 U2~~~~~~~~U 0c S &gt;. ...GJ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 0 4 0~~~~00 &gt; 0 . 5. 0 04- U~~~~~ ~~~~~ U2C0 &gt; (1)~~~~~S (1U 0 -) 4 .0 _H</page><page sequence="6">1086 Academy of Management Review October that general cognitive ability is a significant predictor of job and career outcomes in organizational settings (Gottfredson, 1986; Hunter, 1986; Schmidt, Hunter, Outerbridge, &amp; Goff, 1988). Despite this evidence, the cognitive or psychometric perspective has been faulted for being too limited and not inclusive of the full range of human activities that might be labeled intelligent. Also, it may be an overly strict, individually centered measure of intelligence that does not account for how intelligence may be defined by, and related to, the social or cultural context in which it develops and functions (Gardner, 1993; Sternberg, 1988). Contextual perspective. Contextualists view individual intelligence as composed of a number of distinct abilities (Sternberg &amp; Salter, 1988), not as an overarching trait common to all individuals. In contrast to the psychometric perspective, in which individual intelligence is invariant to context, contextualists argue that intelligence will vary by specific do- mains; thus, because people are members of different societies and cul- tures, individuals can have different types of intelligence. Radical for- mulists argue for cultural relativism (e.g., Vygotsky, 1978), contending that differences in intelligence reflect differences among cultures and prac- tices, rather than differences among individuals. A theme common to this perspective is that intelligent behavior occurs in a social context that includes expectations, demands, and a history of prior experience. Contextualists argue that intelligence is multifaceted and that there are multiple intelligences, if not within a single individual, then certainly across a spectrum of individuals. Gardner (1993: xi) introduced seven can- didate intelligences: "the linguistic and logical-mathematical intelli- gences that are at such premium in schools today; musical intelligence; spatial intelligence; bodily-kinesthetic intelligence; and two forms of per- sonal intelligence, one directed toward other persons, one directed toward oneself." Naive, popular, or implicit theories of intelligence (Sternberg, 1985a) have been focused on individual performance in everyday work and life contexts, and they have been used to classify intelligence into three categories: practical problem-solving ability, verbal ability, and so- cial competence. Because intelligence is defined relative to a particular context, researchers have been concerned with the characteristics that differentiate contexts, and organizations have been considered a major contextual determinant (Veroff, 1983). Thus, "intelligence in the popular sense of the word is inextricably linked to a specific sociocultural environ- ment" (Cantor &amp; Kihlstrom, 1989: 9). Critics of the contextual perspective contend that even though individ- uals may manifest different "types" of intelligence, this may not refute the existence of a g factor; that is, individuals may simply demonstrate differential weightings of their intellectual abilities in response to situa- tional demands. Supporting this idea are studies that demonstrate that there is not a large variance in individuals' intellectual performance across different contexts (Sternberg &amp; Salter, 1988).</page><page sequence="7">1996 Glynn 1087 Defining individual intelligence. Although there is no one best way to study intelligence (Sternberg, 1985b), the following definition is culled from this review of the literature: Individual intelligence is defined as a person's capabil- ity to process, interpret, encode, manipulate, and access information so as to acquire, retain, and apply knowl- edge quickly and successfully to meet external chal- lenges or solve problems in a particular domain or context. Stated simply, individual intelligence is a person's purposeful information processing that aids adaptation to task or environmental challenges. It involves both task-relevant domain intelligence (i.e., declarative knowl- edge) as well as flexible rules (i.e., procedural knowledge) for acquiring information and combining existing declarative knowledge to develop new knowledge. Organizational Intelligence Although intelligence has been associated primarily with individuals, some authors have begun to conceptualize and measure it at a collective level (e.g., Williams &amp; Sternberg, 1988). From the outset, it must be acknowl- edged that extending a microlevel construct to the macrolevel organization invites opportunities for ambiguity and threats of anthropomorphism. Ad- ditional confusion stems from the various uses of organizational intelli- gence, including a description of the intelligence of individual organiza- tion members as well as a description of the system (e.g., March &amp; Olsen, 1986; Pinchot &amp; Pinchot, 1993; Quinn, 1992); a description of information processing capabilities as well a description of the outcome or product of these processes (e.g., intelligence about new technologies or one's compet- itors); a real property of systems (Huber, 1990; Leidner &amp; Elam, 1995); and a metaphor for organizational systems (Garud &amp; Kotha, 1994; Morgan, 1986). In this article, the conceptual boundaries of organizational intelli- gence are established according to the three working assumptions that Walsh and Ungson (1991) used to develop the construct of organizational memory: (a) organizations functionally resemble information-processing systems that process information from the environment; as such, organiza- tions exhibit intelligence that is similar in function to that of individuals; (b) modeling organizations as information-processing systems implies that they also are interpretative systems that scan, interpret, and diagnose environmental events for their uncertainty and complexity, which supports the basic idea that adaptive capability underlies intelligent action; and (c) conceptualizing an organization as "a network of intersubjectively shared meanings that are sustained through the development and use of a common language and everyday social interactions" (Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991: 61) delineates intelligence as a concept that is invoked to explain a system but is itself not easily observed.</page><page sequence="8">1088 Academy of Management Review October The first assumption, that of functional similarity between human and organizational intelligence, leads to the following definition of organiza- tional intelligence: Organizational intelligence is an organization's capabil- ity to process, interpret, encode, manipulate, and access information in a purposeful, goal-directed manner, so it can increase its adaptive potential in the environment in which it operates. This definition embodies the second boundary condition (i.e., that organi- zational intelligence is adaptive); like individual intelligence, organiza- tional intelligence is related to solving problems, meeting objectives, and making effective responses to environmental challenges. Regarding the third boundary condition, organizational intelligence offers an explana- tion for experiential learning processes that underscore organizational successes and failures (Glynn et al., 1994). Learning intelligently implies that an organization has learned correctly, accurately, and appropriately from experience; armed with good and valid information, the organization has the potential to perform more effectively. Although organizational intelligence may bear a functional resem- blance to individual intelligence, it is clearly not commensurate with individual intelligence. As a property of the collective, organizational intelligence is a social outcome. Organizational intelligence can result from the accumulated wisdom of its members as well as from interactions among its members, who can be characterized as having varying levels of intelligence (according to psychometric measurements) and varying types of intelligence that are tied to specific domains or contexts (e.g., practical, linguistic, or social intelligence). That the interchange among intelligent members affects the intelligence of a collective is evident in the concept of "group intelligence," defined as a concept distinct from the more familiar concept of individual intelligence-for in the interdependent context of group func- tioning, group members may be involved in the collaboration differentially with regard to their abilities and desires, yield- ing a system with characteristics and capacities unlike those one group member could display alone. Group intelligence is the functional intelligence of a group of people working as a unit. (Williams &amp; Sternberg, 1988: 356) Given that organizational intelligence is not identical with, but related to, the intelligence of its membership, mechanisms that relate individual and organizational intelligence are considered. Mechanisms Relating Individual and Organizational Intelligences By drawing from other multilevel models that were used to examine the link between microlevel and macrolevel processes (DiMaggio, 1991; Glynn et al., 1994; Rousseau, 1985), I identify the following set of mecha-</page><page sequence="9">1996 Glynn 1089 nisms: (a) aggregation effects, whereby individual members' intelligence accumulates to become organizational intelligence; (b) cross-level effects, whereby individuals' intelligence is transformed and codified as organiza- tional intelligence; and (c) distributed effects, whereby organizational in- telligence is embedded in the structured patterns of thought and action in which organizational members interact and engage. Each of these mechanisms is built on a different set of theoretical assumptions and has implications for the way in which organizational intelligence is measured; the premises and implications of these three models are summarized in Table 2. Aggregation model. Through an aggregation model, organizational intelligence is modeled as consisting of the accumulated intelligence of its membership. This model is based on well-defined measures of individual intelligence, such as IQ tests. Organizational intelligence can be mea- sured, then, as the sum, the mean, or the maximum value of members' scores on measures of general cognitive ability (Williams &amp; Sternberg, 1988). This measure thus affords an overall index of the level of organiza- tional intelligence, but it does not capture the multiplicity of intelligence types within an organization. An aggregation model represents a simple, straightforward, easily calculated rendering of organizational intelligence, which is consistent with the way in which individual intelligence has long been measured. However, the usefulness of an aggregation model of organizational intelli- gence is severely limited. It is most applicable to organizations that have a very small membership, which is fairly homogeneous with respect to level and type of intelligence, and that have a structure with little special- ization. Single-product (or single-service) organizations operated by a sole entrepreneur or very few partners may describe a case in which organiza- tional intelligence and individual intelligence are virtually one and the same (i.e., typically that of the chief executive). There is dubious validity in applying an aggregation model to very large conglomerates that have highly divisionalized structures and a diverse, heterogeneously intelli- gent, geographically dispersed, and loosely coordinated workforce, in which intraorganizational processes are likely to affect the relationship between the intelligence of individuals and the intelligence of the system. The assumptions of an aggregation model imply that organizations can be smarter (or less intelligent) than their membership, if the organiza- tional IQ is significantly higher (or lower) than that of the majority of its members; members with a very high (or very low) IQ score may skew the distribution and inflate (or deflate) the mean organizational intelligence score. Thus, although the simplicity of an aggregation model is attractive, its ability to capture veridically organizational intelligence is quite re- stricted. Cross-level model. A cross-level model directs attention to the trans- ference of intelligence. Accordingly, diffusion and institutionalization pro- cesses convert and encode individual intelligence in the organization's</page><page sequence="10">1090 Academy of Management Review October fn -0 I.. &gt; &gt;4 4- cn -4 4 -, a) 0 a) 0 &gt; a; - a) 0 Wn 0 U 0 U U -4 -4 4- &gt; 0 0 4- 0 O..

Three types of transference mechanisms are considered here: structured organizational roles, technology, and social or political influences. One structural mechanism instituted by GE, Coca-Cola, Cigna, Hew- lett-Packard, Monsanto, and Young &amp; Rubican is the new organizational role known as the chief learning officer (CLO). These executives are "in charge of directing knowledge to the right places" and extending the flow of individual knowledge, information, and intelligence throughout the organization (Ward, 1996: 12). In the following example, GE's CLO brings disparate information together to solve a problem intelligently: The General Electric manager was dismayed. As he spoke to a recent gathering of company workers, he displayed a chart showing that sales of appliances had slowed substantially. The appliance division, he and others surmised, appeared to be in serious marketing trouble. But the attendees soon learned that the problem had nothing to do with pricing, advertising or other basic marketing tasks. "Up speaks a GE Capital guy and puts up his chart showing consumer debt reaching saturation levels,". . . "Suddenly, ev- eryone had a whole new angle on the problem." That new perspective led the employees to try solutions not from market- ing but rather from finance, such as new ways to help debt- laden customers pay for big-ticket appliances. (Ward, 1996: 12) Just as organizational roles (e.g., CLOs) can diffuse intelligence, so too can technologies. Because intelligence involves information processing, those MIS and expert system technologies that facilitate organizational learning (e.g., Argyris, 1992; Elofson &amp; Konsynski, 1993) similarly enable the development of organizational intelligence. Huber (1990: 63) contended that the "[u]se of computer-assisted information storage and acquisition technologies leads to organizational intelligence that is more accurate, comprehensive, timely, and available." Similarly, Quinn (1992: 311) ac- knowledged that much organizational wisdom and managerial knowl- edge is captured and stored by information technologies (IT) in databases; the result is that "[w]ell developed IT systems help eliminate errors [and] leverage intellect." In spite of the advantages such computerized systems offer, however, they are constrained to operate within a particular context and use the algorithms, decision rules, and assumptions that define that particular context. Thus, even though MIS, expert systems, and computer technologies may hasten the development of organizational intelligence, they also limit it to a particular context that is delineated by the initial conditions under which the computer algorithms were developed. Social and political influences also affect diffusion and transference mechanisms. There is ample evidence that "groups have the potential to enhance individual processes-as well as the potential to degrade them"</page><page sequence="13">1996 Glynn 1093 (Sniezek, 1992: 131). The effects of such interpersonal factors are evident in the group intelligence that emerges from interpersonal interactions and processes (Williams &amp; Sternberg, 1988). In a series of studies that exam- ined the influences of majority and minority views on task performance, Nemeth (1986) demonstrated that the positions expressed by a majority of individuals tended to foster convergent thinking, limit the number of alternatives, and enforce conformity to the prevailing views. Conversely, minority viewpoints tended to stimulate divergent thinking and led to more effective solutions: "Persons exposed to opposing minority views exert more cognitive effort . . . attend to more aspects of the situation. . . and . . . are more likely to detect novel solutions or come to new decisions" (Nemeth, 1986: 25). Thus, underrepresenting or suppressing minority view- points can affect the processing of information and, in turn, both intelli- gence and creativity. More generally, intelligence is fostered in social climates in which diversity of viewpoints is permitted. Laughlin (1988: 258) pointed out that conformity to a unanimous but erroneous majority can be reduced when a dissenting minority viewpoint is introduced. Numerous studies of group polarization have demonstrated that an initial tendency of groups toward a particular direction is enhanced following group discussion. In his re- view of this literature, Isenberg (1986: 1143) noted that there is evidence that such polarization can result in group norms of risk or caution and that "group members associate ability and skill with riskiness (or cau- tion) and thus become more risky (or more cautious) in order to appear more able and skillful." In one study, for instance, the authors (Baron &amp; Roper, 1976) found that, in order to appear more intelligent, individuals po- larized their estimates to align with that of the norms. Thus, these social- psychological influences explain why the intelligence that characterizes a collective may not be simply an aggregation of members' intelligence. Distributed model. In contrast to the cross-level model, a distributed model is focused not on how intelligence is transferred within an organiza- tion but, rather, on how organizational intelligence emerges from the pat- terned interactions that constitute the organization (Brown &amp; Dugoid, 1991; Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991). Two key insights of a distributed model follow from the contextual perspective: (a) intelligence must be understood in terms of, and in relation to, the social and cultural context in which it develops and (b) intelligence may exist beyond individuals and be distributed within the structural and symbolic systems of the collective. Therefore, intelligence inheres as much in the artifacts and individuals that surround one as in one's own skull. My intelligence does not stop at my skin; rather, it encompasses my tools (paper, pencil, computer), and my network of associates (office mates, professional colleagues, others whom I can phone or to whom I can dispatch electronic messages). (Gardner, 1993: xiii) Central to the distributed model is Walsh and Ungson's (1991: 60) third assumption, that an organization is a system of "intersubjectively shared</page><page sequence="14">1094 Academy of Management Review October meanings" sustained through social interaction. March and Olsen (1986: 26) allowed for the possibility of intelligent action within loosely coupled organizations, and they argued that some "central mechanisms of organi- zational intelligence" are not limited to only coordination, control, and evaluation systems in organized anarchies, but that "ambiguous goals, loose coupling and garbage can processes are . . . frequently . . . forms of intelligence." Thus, organizational symbols, patterns of interaction, cul- ture, and socialization processes distribute and encapsulate organiza- tional intelligence because "patterns of behavior in organizations code ideas" (Sandelands &amp; Stablein, 1987: 143). A distributed model of organizational intelligence is informed by orga- nizational theories that center on the creation of meaning, the social con- struction of reality, and the development of organizational culture and symbolism (e.g., Daft &amp; Weick, 1984; Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991; Weick, 1979). The idea that organizational intelligence arises from embedded interac- tions is consistent with the view that organizations consist of interlocked and institutionalized behaviors (Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1966; Sandelands &amp; Stablein, 1987; Weick, 1979). In this case, the focus is primarily on the patterning and dynamism of these organizational behaviors rather than the intellectual capacity of individual organizational members (e.g., Weick &amp; Roberts, 1993). This view is echoed in theories of learning that contextualize learning in the social, cultural, and communal environment in which it takes place (Brown &amp; Dugoid, 1991). Intelligence, according to Weick and Roberts (1993), is the hallmark of those organizational systems designed for reliability over efficiency. Sandelands and Stablein (1987: 138), in their construction of "organizational mind," described intelligence as "the ability to maintain a working similarity between mind and nature. . More generally, this ability is concerned with achieving and maintain- ing congruence or 'isomorphism' between what is mind (i.e., ideas, feel- ings) and what is external." An organization may be smarter than its individual members. Whereas individuals are limited in their capacity to process information (March &amp; Simon, 1958), this limitation is easily overcome by the collective. Routine processes and organizational symbols that are rich in information that is accurate, relevant, and externally isomorphic can lead to smart organizations. Conversely, however, individual members may be smarter than the organization; this is particularly true when organizational sys- tems fail to institutionalize intelligent ideas or recognize the intelligent contributions of members. INFLUENCES OF INTELLIGENCE ON ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION The process of innovation is parallel for individuals and orga- nizations. For each the game is one of intelligent capitalization on chance. (Staw, 1990: 305) Organizational Innovation Organizational innovation is the process of bringing new, problem- solving ideas into use (Amabile, 1988; Kanter, 1983). An innovation is novel</page><page sequence="15">1996 Glynn 1095 to the adopting organization, but it may imitate something that exists elsewhere (Aiken &amp; Hage, 1971; Damanpour, 1991; Kimberly, 1981; Marcus, 1988; Rogers &amp; Shoemaker, 1971; Van de Ven, 1986). Innovation is intendedly adaptive, and it is undertaken typically in response to unfamiliar, unex- pected, or nonroutine problems. More formally, innovation is defined as "nonroutine, significant, and discontinuous organizational change" (Mezias &amp; Glynn, 1993: 78) that em- bodies a new idea that is not consistent with the current concept of the organization's business (Galbraith, 1982). Innovation, particularly radi- cal, frame-breaking innovation (Dewar &amp; Dutton, 1986; Ettlie, Bridges, &amp; O'Keefe, 1984; Nord &amp; Tucker, 1987), involves organizational intelligence because it involves changes in existing organizational competencies (Mezias &amp; Glynn, 1993) and cognitive paradigms (Anderson &amp; Tushman, 1990; Tushman &amp; Anderson, 1986; Tushman, Newman, &amp; Romanelli, 1986), mental models (Senge, 1990), and theories in use (Argyris &amp; Schon, 1978). Innovation is a subset of the broader category of organizational change; innovation encompasses creativity as a subset (Woodman, Sawyer, &amp; Grif- fin, 1993). In conceptualizing the process of organizational innovation, most re- searchers use a stage approach. However, "there is no one universal and smooth sequence of steps from initial vision through idea generation through development and final implementation" (Amabile, 1988: 151). Many researchers (e.g., Marcus, 1988; Rogers, 1983; Staw, 1990; Zaltman, Duncan, &amp; Holbeck, 1973; Van de Ven, 1986) support the following two-stage model: (a) an initiation stage, which consists of "all activities pertaining to prob- lem perception, information gathering, attitude formation and evaluation, and resource attainment leading to the decision to adopt," and (b) an implementation stage, which consists of "all events and actions pertaining to modifications in both an innovation and an organization, initial utiliza- tion, and continued use of the innovation when it becomes a routine feature of the organization" (Damanpour, 1991: 562). By using this two-stage model (depicted in Figure 1), I do not mean to suggest that organizational innova- tion is necessarily simple, linear, or fully preprogrammed. The process was realistically described by Quinn (1985: 83) as "opportunistic, customer responsive, tumultuous, nonlinear and interactive in its development." The inherent simplicity of this model is useful, however, for the theory- development objectives of this article. Several researchers have elaborated on this basic model to expand the number of innovation stages. For instance, Cooper and Zmud (1990) proposed a six-stage model for information technology innovation: initia- tion, adoption, adaptation, acceptance, routinization, and infusion. With a similar focus on technology-based innovative projects, Roberts and Fus- feld (1981) viewed implementation as involving six stages: preproject, proj- ect possibilities, project initiation, project execution, project outcome eval- uation, and project transfer. Although these fine-grained approaches offer a detailed examination of the innovation process, which is useful for tracking and managing innovative projects in a firm, this level of specifi-</page><page sequence="16">1096 Academy of Management Review October cation is beyond the scope of this conceptual framework. Because creators of most stage models acknowledge the dual components of initiation and implementation/adoption as being vital, this article focuses on these two key stages. The two-stage model is useful because it breaks down the innovation process into a series of tasks, each associated with a particular set of skills or roles, which, it is proposed, relates to a particular set of intellectual demands. Dominant intelligences and organizational innovation. Several re- searchers have found that different individuals, or different types of individ- uals, are associated with different stages of the innovation process. Innova- tors (Kirton, 1976) are the idea generators who initiate idea generation in stage 1; they to be nonconformers and will disregard or violate existing orga- nizational rules and norms as the need arise. By contrast, stage 2 adaptors (Kirton, 1976), or innovation champions (Howell &amp; Higgins, 1990; Pinchot, 1985), have more bureaucratic savvy, which they use to navigate ideas through the organization's formal and informal "corporate immune" sys- tems (Pinchot, 1985), where resistance is often encountered. Roberts and Fusfeld (1981)' found support for these distinctions in their analysis of thousands of staff profiles in R&amp;D and engineering firms: Idea generators have expertise in a limited number of fields, enjoy conceptualizing ab- stract ideas, see new and different ways of doing things, and tend to work alone. In contrast, innovation champions have a wider range of interests, are more applied, and interact with others to sell ideas. Beath (1991) also found that, similar to other innovation champions, IT champions also re- lied on the technical resources and political support of the organization. Implicit in the distinction between innovators and adaptors (Kirton, 1976) is that different types of expertise or intelligence are involved at each stage. In the initial, inventive stage, intelligence concerning task- specific domains is vital. Technical knowledge of the task domain (whether it be, for instance, verbal, mathematical, mechanical, spatial, musical, aesthetic, or practical) is important to solving problems within that do- main. In the second stage, however, it is knowledge about the organiza- tion's web of formal and informal influence systems (e.g., social, political, or interpersonal intelligence) that can influence the acceptance of new ideas and innovative change. Thus, the dominant intelligence that suc- cessfully underlies the generation of new ideas is proposed to be different from the dominant intelligence that underlies successful implementation of those ideas. Although the intelligence behind idea generation may capitalize on domain-relevant and creativity skills (Amabile, 1988), the intelligence behind implementation requires knowledge about the organi- 'In their complete model, Roberts and Fusfeld (1981) proposed five critical functions, corresponding to their five-stage model of innovation. The first two functions (idea generation, championing) are discussed, but the remaining three, all relating to project management once an innovation is adopted (project leading, gatekeeping, sponsoring or coaching), are not.</page><page sequence="17">1996 Glynn 1097 zational context and interpersonal skills. For both stages, the cognitive agility to combine and recombine existing knowledge in new and different ways is critical, as it is to any process of creativity, innovation, and change (Amabile, 1988); thus, procedural knowledge must be fluid. Proposition 1: Different dominant intelligences are asso- ciated with different stages of the innovation process. The dominant intelligence of innovation initiation (stage 1) is technical knowledge that is relevant to the task domain or problem. The dominant intelligence of innova- tion implementation and adoption (stage 2) is social, po- litical, and/or interpersonal, which is specific to the orga- nizational context. Both stages are characterized by procedural flexibility in the combining and recombining of factual (declarative) knowledge. Levels of intelligence and organizational innovation. Figure 1 depicts the first stage of innovation as being based on (a) domain-specific intelli- gence at the individual level and (b) context-specific intelligence at the organizational level. Domain-specific technical intelligence generally re- flects an individual's education, training, expertise, and knowledge within a particular context (Gardner, 1993); thus it is usually described at the individual level of analysis. Organizational intelligence can be domain specific also; certainly, organizations develop distinctive competencies within their industries or environmental niches that may reflect domain intelligence. However, for organizations, context-specific knowledge at the initiation stage primarily relates to problem perception and information gathering (Damanpour, 1991); it makes unfamiliar events understandable in terms of how they relate specifically to the organization. In other words, organizations tend to understand novel or uncertain environmental events not in an abstract manner, but in a self-referential one (Milliken, 1990). Proposition 2: There are different dominant intelligences at different levels of analysis that affect the initiation stage of organizational innovation. The dominant indi- vidual intelligence is domain relevant, whereas the dom- inant organizational intelligence is context specific. Antecedents of Innovation Initiation at the Individual Level Individual creativity. Although individual intelligence may affect in- novation initiation directly (Proposition 2), it also works through individual creativity to generate ideas or perceive problems. Even though groups or organizations may be creative (Amabile, 1988; Woodman et al., 1993), the individual level is examined here for two reasons. First, although one can describe the creativity of a collective, it always involves individuals. Amabile (1988: 126) defined creativity as "the production of novel and useful ideas by an individual or small group of individuals working together," and Woodman and colleagues (1993: 293) defined organizational creativity as</page><page sequence="18">1098 Academy of Management Review October "the creation of a valuable, useful new product, service, idea, procedure, or process by individuals working together in a complex social system" (emphases added to both quotations). Second, because this work is explor- atory and directed toward theory building, a simple, parsimonious ap- proach was adopted. Proposition 3: Individual creativity is an antecedent of the initiation of organizational innovation. Even though creativity is an antecedent of innovation, it is not a sufficient condition. Enabling conditions that facilitate the development of organiza- tional innovation are also involved (see Figure 1). Enabling conditions. The availability of opportunities and the absence of internal and external constraints affect the unfolding of the innovation process. At the individual level, internal constraints result from individu- als' "transient emotional and motivational states, such as depression or elation, learned helplessness or feelings of control, inability to concentrate or particular ability to concentrate," whereas external constraints stem from environmental conditions, "such as loud noises, frequent interrup- tions, insufficient illumination, inadequate resources for accomplishing the task at hand, and so on" (Sternberg &amp; Powell, 1988: 998). For organizations, Amabile and Gryskiewicz (1987) found, from their interviews with R&amp;D scientists, that lack of operational autonomy or lack of freedom over one's work or ideas inhibited creativity. Amabile (1988) also noted that truly creative performance is enhanced when extrinsic constraints are not overwhelming. At the organizational level, any innova- tive change must overcome the constraints of organizational inertia and resistance. In general, situations in which constraints are absent and individuals have autonomy and control seem to favor the expression of intelligence and the generation of innovative ideas. Adequate resources, support, and appropriate incentives are also nec- essary for innovation. Reviewing educational and industrial studies, Mum- ford and Gustafson (1988: 37) concluded that "environments providing re- wards for or explicitly stating the need for creativity engender high levels of creative activity." Amabile and Gryskiewicz (1987) found that sufficient resources, such as facilities, equipment, information, and funds, contrib- uted to the creativity of R&amp;D scientists. Although these environmental factors encourage creativity, it is reasonable to expect that they would encourage the expression of intelligence as well; having adequate time and information resources to understand the task environment as well as the support to address problems would enable intelligent action. More- over, having the requisite power within social, cultural, or organizational settings to act on one's understanding would also be a vital condition of intelligent action. Proposition 4: The initiation, idea generation of organiza- tional innovation is dependent upon individual creativ- ity; creativity results in innovation under the following</page><page sequence="19">1996 Glynn 1099 enabling conditions: when there is opportunity for cre- ative expression and an absence of constraints, when there are adequate resources and support to develop ideas, and when there are strong intrinsic incentives. Antecedents of individual creativity. Individual creativity is driven by individual intelligence, which is moderated by individual characteris- tics and the situational context (as shown in Figure 1). The rationale for positing these interactive effects can be found in the conclusion Mumford and Gustafson (1988: 28) reached from their extensive review of historical, experimental, and field research on creativity: "Creative behavior is likely to be determined by a complex interaction between the attributes of the individual and the attributes of the environment." Individual intelligence and creativity. Individual creativity has long been associated with intelligence, both conceptually (e.g., Gardner, 1993; Sternberg, 1985a) and empirically: "Studies of creative adult artists, scien- tists, mathematicians, and writers find them scoring very high on tests of general intelligence" (Barron &amp; Harrington, 1981: 445). Based on his case analyses of seven creative individuals-Freud, Einstein, Picasso, Stravin- sky, Elliot, Graham, and Gandhi-Gardner (1993: 363) concluded that "cre- ators differ from one another not only in terms of their dominant intelli- gence but also in terms of breadth and the combination of intelligences." Individuals of higher intelligence tend to outscore those of lower intel- ligence on measures of originality, preference for complexity, and concep- tual fluency and flexibility (Steiner, 1965). Amabile (1988: 140) noted that creativity is not necessarily related to the amount of task-domain (or de- clarative) knowledge that an individual possesses, but rather to the way in which it is stored and accessed: For increased creativity, "It is not possible to have too much knowledge; it is possible to have too many algorithms." Thus, in addition to relevant knowledge and expertise, a creative individual also will have flexible procedural knowledge. Although research attests to a link between intelligence and creativ- ity, high levels of intelligence do not guarantee creativity. Nowhere is this more evident than in Feldman's (1982) book, Whatever Happened to the Quiz Kids? For these children with very high IQs, "their creative perfor- mances in their later lives have nowhere near matched their intelligent performances in their earlier lives" (Sternberg, 1988: 125). What, then, ac- counts for the strength (or weakness) in the intelligence-creativity link? In their analysis of published correlations between creativity and traditional measures of intelligence (i.e., tests of general intelligence, g factor, or IQ), Barron and Harrington (1981) found that overall correlation values ranged from nonsignificant to moderately positive; however, when intelligence was measured by raters' judgments or respondents' percep- tions (instead of IQ-type measures), correlations were significant. Even though psychometric measures of general intelligence (IQ or g factor) failed to predict creativity (Barron &amp; Harrington, 1981), they do predict</page><page sequence="20">1100 Academy of Management Review October job performance and career success in more established contexts (e.g., Gottfredson, 1986; Hunter, 1986; O'Reilly &amp; Chatman, 1994; Ree et al., 1995). Thus, it may not only be the measure of intelligence that is of concern, but it may be also the type of intelligence. Assessments of g factor or IQ tend to tap primarily verbal and mathematical intelligence, rather than other types of intelligence (Gardner, 1993). For intelligence to be related to creativity, the dominant intelligence (and its assessment) must relate to the task domain in which creativity occurs. Proposition 5: Individual intelligence results in creativity when the dominant intelligence relates to the particular task domain (declarative knowledge) and when there is flexibility in combining rules for accessing and storing information (procedural knowledge). Individual and situational context of creativity. Summarizing findings from extant research, Amabile (1988: 142) formulated "The Intrinsic Motiva- tion Principle of Creativity: People will be most creative when they feel motivated primarily by the interest, enjoyment, satisfaction, and challenge of the work itself -and not by external pressures." Subsequent studies she conducted with her colleagues using undergraduate and adult samples, measuring creativity both with pen-and-pencil assessments and expert ratings, attested to the validity of this principle (Amabile, Hill, Hennes- sey, &amp; Tighe, 1994). Further support of the role of intrinsic motivation in linking intelligence and creativity was provided by Glynn and Webster (1993), who found significant relationships among intrinsic motivation, cognitive playfulness, and innovation intentions for a sample of highly intelligent adults. Woodman and colleagues (1993: 298) advocated a focus on creativity that goes beyond an individually centered perspective but acknowledged "an appreciation for the creative person as a partial explanation for cre- ativity." Although researchers have debated whether creative individuals have an enduring constellation of attributes (e.g., openness to experience, intellectual curiosity, assertiveness, independence of judgment, spontane- ity), a longitudinal study of women's adult development supports the no- tion that individuals do have creative personalities and that these person- alities tend to endure over time. Helson, Roberts, and Agronick (1995) found that intelligence (measured as SAT verbal score), aspirations, and scores on a creative temperament scale all contributed to the prediction of occu- pational creativity. Proposition 6: Individual intelligence results in creativity when individuals have high intrinsic motivation and a personal orientation toward creativity. Noting that "situational variables have been all but totally ignored in theories and testing of intelligence," Sternberg and Powell (1988: 997) suggested several variables that operate to affect the expression of intelli- gence, including absence of constraints, adequate resources and support,</page><page sequence="21">1996 Glynn 1101 novelty (or unusualness) of circumstances, and expectations of intelligent action. The first two (constraints and resources) are treated in this frame- work (see Figure 1) as enabling conditions that affect both creativity and innovation; the remaining two situational variables are discussed in terms of their effects on the individual intelligence-creativity relationship. Individuals tend to perform better in familiar settings: "Recall of stimu- lus material tends to be best when it occurs in the same setting as that in which the material was learned" (Sternberg &amp; Powell, 1988: 999). Simi- larly, in their review of the research, Alba and Hutchinson (1987: 427) found that a person's ability to solve problems creatively was affected by the novelty of the problem: "In situations in which a problem is familiar, prior experience may lead to the direct retrieval of a prior solution-as in the case of routinized problem solving. . . In situations in which the problem is new, expertise allows an individual to generate and evaluate potential solutions." When tasks are heuristic (as opposed to algorithmic, where task behavior is governed by fixed and specific rules), creativity is favored (Amabile, 1983). Thus, when circumstances are unfamiliar, unusual, or novel, individuals may rely less on already learned behaviors and, in- stead, attempt to acquire new information or reprocess existing informa- tion in new ways that enable creativity. Consistent with the well-documented effects of self-fulfilling prophe- cies, it seems plausible that when intelligence is expected, valued, or demanded, intelligent actions are more likely. Intelligence testing is al- most always done under maximal-performance demands: "One is encour- aged to put forth one's best effort, and the pressure to do so is clear and present" (Sternberg &amp; Powell, 1988: 999). Amabile and Gryskiewicz (1987) found that organizational climate promoted creativity if innovation is val- ued, failures are tolerated, and a spirit of cooperation and collaboration exists. Proposition 7: Individual intelligence results in creativity when the task, problem, or circumstances are novel, un- familiar, or heuristic and when an intelligent approach to problem solving is expected and valued. Organizational Antecedents of Innovation Initiation and Implementation Previous discussion focused on the relationship of organizational in- novation to the stages of innovation (Propositions 1 and 2). In this section, the focus is on how organizational intelligence interacts with organiza- tional and situational characteristics to affect innovation. The rationale for this approach is found in the work of Mumford and Gustafson (1988: 38). These authors stated that innovation is facilitated "by an environment that provides a cognitive basis for creative efforts through structures en- couraging the creation of systematic understandings and ongoing explora- tion of alternative points of view."</page><page sequence="22">1102 Academy of Management Review October Organizational and situational context. In her model of organizational innovation, Amabile (1988: 153) argued that organizations have a basic orientation that motivates them to innovate (or not). Amabile (1988: 154) summarized the most important aspects of the informal arrangements: "a value placed on innovation in general, an orientation toward risk (versus an orientation maintaining the status quo), a sense of pride in the organiza- tion's members and what they are capable of doing, and an offensive strategy of taking the lead toward the future (versus a defensive strategy of simply wanting to protect the organization's past position)." Organizations that value diversity in perspectives, tolerate ambiguity, value innovation, and accept risk taking will tend to have a stronger orientation toward inno- vation. Organizations with a greater capacity for innovation tend to be or- ganic rather than mechanistic in structure (Burns &amp; Stalker, 1995), integra- tive rather than segmentalist (Kanter, 1983), and they have lower formaliza- tion, more role ambiguity, multidisciplinary teams, and job rotation (Staw, 1990). Organizational size, complexity, and formalization are considered obstacles to innovation (Aiken &amp; Hage, 1971; Burns &amp; Stalker, 1995; Kanter, 1983; Nadler &amp; Tushman, 1989; Rogers, 1983). Several studies have demon- strated that flexible environments, broad job definitions, and job autonomy for workers facilitate innovation (Amabile, 1988; Amabile &amp; Gryskiewicz, 1987; Andrews &amp; Farris, 1967; Delbecq &amp; Mills, 1985; Pelz &amp; Andrews, 1966). After reviewing a number of studies on organizational climate, Mumford and Gustafson (1988: 37) concluded that "innovative research-and-design systems are characterized by the recognition and reward of superior per- formance, particularly with respect to the initial exploratory stages of creative endeavors." Leidner and Elam (1995) surveyed senior and middle- level managers who use expert information systems and found that the use of decision support technologies increased organizational intelligence. In general, then, organizations characterized by less bureaucracy; less functional specialization; more fluid, flexible, and integrative structures; increased worker autonomy; and good communication and information flows are thought to be more innovative. Traditionally, the belief has been that organizational factors that favor the initiation of innovation tend to inhibit their implementation and adop- tion; characteristics of the "innovating organization" are aligned with those of the first stage but not the second stage. Marcus (1988: 235) ex- plained the reasoning: Rule-bound approaches, which involve central direction and highly programmed tasks, are supposed to promote implemen- tation; that is, the number of routine tasks prescribed from above should increase as an organization moves toward imple- mentation. . . Conception, proposal generation, and initia- tion, on the other hand, require fewer controls and more auton- omy, because diversity, openness, informality, and the ability to bring a variety of bases of information to bear on a problem need to be encouraged.</page><page sequence="23">1996 Glynn 1103 Work in the 1980s and 1990s suggests that those organizational struc- tures and characteristics that enable initiation also enable implementa- tion; greater autonomy and managerial discretion generally facilitate im- plementation. In his study of how nuclear power plants implemented externally induced safety review innovations, Marcus (1988) found that poor safety records were associated with a rule-bound approach to imple- mentation, whereas better safety records were associated with an ap- proach that allowed managers greater autonomy. One reason for this relationship between degree of implementation autonomy and innovation success is related to intelligence: "Implementators are likely to have greater knowledge at the point of delivery, where there are multiple and contradictory demands . . . [Efforts to centralize authority] may encourage low system comprehension. . . . Autonomy is needed to encourage high levels of commitment and knowledge" (Marcus, 1988: 251). Finally, organizational capacities for learning influence organiza- tional innovation. According to conceptual (e.g., Stata, 1989; Tushman &amp; Nadler, 1986), empirical (e.g., Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990; Henderson &amp; Clark, 1990), and simulation research (e.g., Mezias &amp; Glynn, 1993), an organiza- tion's ability to learn from its own history and experiences affected its capabilities for renewal and change. By extension, then, intelligence can underlie effective learning to enhance organizational innovation. Taking into account this set of organizational and situational factors leads to the following: Proposition 8: Organizational intelligence results in in- novation under conditions of high organizational orien- tation to innovation and when situational factors favor the expression of organizational intelligence, that is, when constraints are absent; the circumstances, prob- lems, or tasks are novel, unfamiliar, or heuristic; ade- quate support and resources are available; an intelligent approach is expected and valued; and an organization has a high capacity for effective learning. IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY, RESEARCH, AND MANAGERIAL PRACTICE Implications for Theory and Research In this article, I developed the construct of organizational intelligence as a social outcome that related to individuals' intelligence by means of aggregation, cross-level, or distributed effects. Thus, understanding and assessing individual intelligence is important to understanding organ- izational intelligence. I discussed how individuals' intelligence can be characterized according to interindividual differences in level or type of intelligence. An extension of this idea is to characterize organizational intelligence according to the homogeneity or heterogeneity of its members'</page><page sequence="24">1104 Academy of Management Review October intelligence with regard to these two dimensions of intelligence. Field research might be conducted to describe organizational intelligence in terms of members' homogeneity of intelligence levels or types, examining differences by members' functional division, hierarchical position, or orga- nizational tenure. More or less innovative business units or firms may be compared for their differences in members' intelligence, and for their degree of heterogeneity. An alternative research strategy is to use com- puter simulations to assess the effects that variance, heterogeneity, or composition of individual members' intelligence have on organizational innovation. The simulation methodology could model how organizational innovation unfolds over time and how heterogeneity in level or type of individual intelligences affects the process. Such a model might build upon March's (1991) simulation of mutual learning between members of an organization and an organizational code; such research holds promise for researchers' examination of the relationships between microlevels and macrolevels of intelligence. This article focused on intelligence as purposeful, adaptive informa- tion processing that was functionally similar but not equivalent for individ- uals and organizations. In the future, researchers might investigate the conditions under which organizational intelligence may differ more or less markedly from individuals' intelligence. Such an investigation would require a specification of the general laws that govern the development and expression of intelligence; this is a process of "microtranslation" (DiMaggio, 1991: 77). Although (perhaps) information-processing aspects of intelligence are functionally similar across levels of analysis (Huber, 1991: 89), other aspects of intelligence may not be so correspondingly similar. Two such aspects of intelligence that may differ across levels of analysis are considered next: (a) differences in the way intelligence develops and (b) differences in the relationship between the social or cultural context and organizational intelligence. Organizational intelligence may develop at different rates in response to different kinds of experiences (e.g., success versus failure or threat versus opportunity). If intelligence involves the development of rules that are environmentally isomorphic (Sandelands &amp; Stablein, 1987) or ecologi- cally valid (Siegler &amp; Richards, 1988), these rules will change in response to differences in context or experience. Further, one might expect that the rate of rule development proceeds more rapidly for organizations than for individuals, given the greater information-processing capacity of a collective. Alternatively, one might hypothesize that an institutionalized system would be more inert and reliant on previously learned rules be- cause of group pressures to conformity, particularly in the absence of dissenting minority opinions (e.g., Laughlin, 1988; Nemeth, 1986). Addi- tional modification of this basic idea might include a consideration of organizational size and its effects on the development of intelligence. Specifically, are there limits to intelligence as the size of a group increases and problems of information communication, coordination, interpretation,</page><page sequence="25">1996 Glynn 1105 and integration multiply? In this article, I focused on the intelligence of individuals and organizations; understanding how intelligence develops and unfolds in small groups or teams is an important agenda for future re- search. Differences in the relationship between intelligence and context might be different across levels of analysis. For organizations, this notion implies the consideration of different levels or types of intelligence across different types of organizations. To map the existence and dominance of different types of intelligence, Sternberg's (1985b) three-part framework on intelli- gence (consisting of analytical, creative, and contextual components) could be used in different organizational contexts, structures, and cultures. One might speculate that more organic types of organizational structures, because of their flexible and innovative capabilities (Burns &amp; Stalker, 1995), would be associated with more creative aspects of intelligence. Conversely, mechanistic organizations, with their emphasis on bureau- cratic, functional specialization might place a premium upon analytical (or IQ-type) intelligence. Further, the intelligence of executive leadership also could be analyzed for organizational and industry differences. Stern- berg (Trotter, 1986: 60) suggested that Lee Iacocca has a high level of contextual intelligence or "street smarts." An interesting question is whether his type of intelligence extends to other executives at Fortune 100 firms or auto manufacturing firms. The conceptual framework proposed herein focused on radical innova- tion because it made more cognitive demands; future researchers might investigate the effects of intelligence on more incremental innovation. Mezias and Glynn (1993) demonstrated that different types of organiza- tional strategies often yield unintended consequences; strategies intended to increase innovation often resulted in more incremental innovation than radical innovation. In linking type of intelligence to type of innovation, one might postulate that analytical intelligence (typically assessed by standardized psychometric instruments like IQ tests) may rely heavily on learned and programmed information structures and rules that may be easily accessed but not so easily manipulated in the service of innovation that is radical or "frame breaking" (Tushman et al., 1986). Correspondingly, one might compare the role that intelligence plays in fostering technologi- cal versus nontechnological innovations. The proposed model relates intelligence to organizational innovation, which is broadly construed as a two-stage process: (a) initiation and idea generation and (b) implementation and adoption. More fine-grained ap- proaches to the constructs of intelligence and innovation represent prom- ising areas for future conceptual and empirical research. For instance, researchers might investigate the relationship of intelligence to subcate- gories of initiation and implementation. Future work might be directed toward understanding intelligence in terms of other cognitive organizational processes and placing it within the nomological web that constitutes organizational cognition. Related</page><page sequence="26">1106 Academy of Management Review October constructs include organizational learning and memory; processes related to the development and persistence of organizational routines, rituals, and symbols; and organizational adaptation and change. In many of these concepts, organizational intelligence seems to be an implied but under- specified variable. Many organizational learning theorists contend that although learning may lead to change, it does not necessarily ensure organizational adaptation (Glynn et al., 1994). Intelligence makes experi- ence understandable, which aids the development of domain knowledge and the construction of ecologically valid rules that are effective in dealing with environmental demands. Thus, intelligence is implicitly at the core of the learning organization (Senge, 1990); it is what enables a firm to learn from its own experience and the experience of other firms. Distributed views of intelligence draw attention to the intelligence embedded in insti- tutionalized patterns of structure and symbols. An interesting research agenda might develop from an examination of organizational routines and artifacts to determine what they reveal about the intelligence of that system. As in the oft-cited example of the large and varied Eskimo vocabu- lary for snow (e.g., Whorf, 1956), so too might the analysis of the structure and content of organizational acronyms, metaphor, or slang reveal the intelligence underlying the coded content and codification processes of language. Implications for Managerial Practice This article points to the vital role of an organization's intellectual resources and the importance of managing intellectual capital. Organiza- tional innovation is impossible in the absence of creative geniuses, who initiate innovative processes, and intelligent organizational systems that recognize and support viable innovation. Dominant intelligence needs to fit task demands; this notion suggests that the placement function is important in fitting individuals who have appropriate levels and types of intelligence with jobs that require this intelligence. Even though an accountant may have the mathematical intelligence to perform well in financial matters, he or she may lack the social intelligence needed for a sales position. Thus, managers should place employees in jobs that fit their cognitive skills and abilities. In addition to individual characteristics, managers also must attend to situational factors that enable the expression of intelligence and moti- vate its application to creative solutions and innovative organizational endeavors. Such environments are characterized by an absence of con- straints, novelty of tasks, adequate resources and support, and expecta- tions of intelligent action. Even though this article followed previous re- search (e.g., Amabile, 1988) in proposing that intrinsic motivation was necessary for creativity and innovation, it is also likely that extrinsic motivation plays a role in the process. This seems plausible at the later stage of innovation when individuals take creative, inventive ideas and apply them to organizational needs and problems. As innovation moves</page><page sequence="27">1996 Glynn 1107 out of the idea stage into the implementation stage, extrinsic incentives will probably be more important. If managers are able to influence motiva- tional and situational factors, they will be better able to foster intelligent innovation. Managers also need to adopt a strong business orientation toward innovation and embed this orientation in their organization's op- erating systems and cultural values. Because much of an organization's innovation orientation lies within its visionary leadership (Amabile, 1988), managers are well poised to be exemplary role models and to personify the innovative genius.
