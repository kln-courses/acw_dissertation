<plain_text><page sequence="1">why Amhara get kureynya: sickness and possession in an Ethiopian zar cult1 ALLAN YOUNG-Case Western Reserve University introduction Recent anthropological interest in spirit possession concentrates on socially peripheral cults. These are cults whose spirits are not responsible for upholding the moral code of the larger society and whose members are recruited from segments of society which are deprived of conventional means for satisfying some basic needs. Possession in the cult setting is described as a "philosophy of power" which provides an adaptive strategy for cult members (Lewis 1971:32, 204). The strategy works in various ways: By participating in the cults, people who are socially deprived influence others who are socially privileged. They demand attention and desiderata, and the responsibility for their demands is assigned to cult spirits (Lewis 1971:75-79; see also Shack 1971). They gain opportunities to compete with their social equals. Some members acquire spirit familiars which enable them to offer valuable and remunerative services, especially divining, to the public at large (Wilson 1967:336). Further, the dramaturgical setting of cult meetings offers members a means of self-expression and emotional catharsis which provides "a sense of renewal and an improved capacity for dealing with reality" (Kiev 1972:42, 45; see also Messing 1959:331). These accounts assume that the cults play a socially homeostatic role. Conditions which produce seditious or psychopathological behavior are found to be endemic to the societies in which the cults occur, and the cults are found to inhibit or safely redirect this behavior (e.g., Lewis 1971:120-121, 1969:206; Shack 1971:37-38; Messing 1959:331). They further assume that we can understand the adaptive character of the cults best by concentrating on what happens during possession. The point I want to make in this article is that the second assumption is an obstacle to studying the adaptive strategy of possession cults because it neglects the importance of the illnesses that are caused by spirits. Most accounts of spirit possession cults treat illnesses caused by spirits as an ancillary concern, interesting mainly as events through which people join such cults. However; in the Amhara zar cult, sicknesses caused by spirits remain an important focus for relations between cult members and cult spirits even after initiation. Further, it is by participating in recurrent sickness episodes that members gain access to the adaptive strategies offered by the cult. an Ethiopian zar cult 567</page><page sequence="2">To understand the cults' adaptive role, we must study the occasions during which a devotee learns about and interacts with cult spirits. The obviously important occasions are when she is possessed, when she is told about her possessed behavior, and when she observes and listens to other devotees while they are possessed. But this is not enough, because the spirits also visit her in dreams and during sickness episodes. Moreover, it is these sickness episodes, together with the therapies and rituals they entail, that dominate the interest of many devotees. Devotees are usually recruited through episodes of spirit-caused sickness. Even after initiation, they experience recurrent sickness episodes, and these incidents remain an important focus for the relations between them and cult spirits. Although possession-centered accounts often identify a therapeutic function for the cults, they shift the perspective from the physical complaints of the sick person to a variety of psychiatric disorders which they impute to her (e.g., Lewis 1971:198). Another weakness of possession-centered descriptions stems from their proclivity to use the concept of catharsis in an uncritical or reductionistic way. Lewis (1971:1 20-121), for example, writes that peripheral possession "ventilates aggression and frustra- tion . . . within an uneasy acceptance of the established order of things." But if catharsis is used as an explanation, it must be understood that Losing one's self-awareness and self-consciousness in a spirited assembly that reaches its zenith in the possession experience, where all ego defences and morbid dissatisfactions are transmarginally inhibited, would seem to contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of possession and treatment ceremonies; but it is difficult to say how and why this occurs (Kiev 1972:42; italics mine). This difficulty is compounded when it is further assumed that catharsis occurs mainly in recurrent possession experiences. In practice, many cult members are possessed only infrequently and, even then, they may experience a low degree of mental dissociation and excitement (e.g., Southall 1969:269). Of course "catharsis" can also be used in a metaphorical sense to include the vicarious experiences of spectators, but then how and why it occurs is even more mysterious. Another explanation favored by possession-oriented analyses describes cults as a supportive milieu in which a program of manageable problem solving substitutes for the psychologically destructive circumstances of the outside world. For example, Simon Messing (1959:331) writes that the Amhara zar cult provides "a close-knit social group in which . . . [members] find security and recognition," so that psychologically disturbed members are transformed into "nice psychopaths" who are able to function successfully in the larger society. 1. M. Lewis (1971:199-200), P. M. Yap (1960:125), and others have traced the effectiveness of the new regime to the possession experience's capacity for dramatizing an aspect of the self which can be identified with an agency that is credited with transcendental power (i.e., the cult spirits). But once more we ask: How is the identification made convincing to cult members, particularly when possession is infrequent and rudimentary for many of them? An answer to this question can be traced, in part, to the cognitive functions played by sickness episodes which are caused by spirits. These episodes can be analyzed as events during which a person articulates, examines, and modifies some part of his "mazeway." Wallace (1970:1 5-20, 237-238) conceives of a mazeway as a map on which are inscribed valued goals, objects which must be manipulated or avoided in order to achieve these goals, and plans and strategies for manipulating or avoiding these objects. A sickness episode would have to meet three conditions in order to be an occasion that might affect an individual's mazeway: (1) The ailment must be thought to be serious, so that the sick person and her family are actively engaged materially and psychologically. (2) It must be 568 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="3">symptomatically ambiguous, so that rival etiologies are compared to each other, at least initially. (3) Its etiologies must implicate cosmologically important agencies and socially important behavior. Episodes of this sort are important because of their capacity to alter mazeways by communicating and confirming the existence of objects and the efficacy of strategies which are unfamiliar to members of the larger society. Information is communicated when rival etiologies are compared, and an accurate diagnosis is sought. The ontological status of the information is confirmed during therapy and its aftermath, as the spiritual agencies are experienced directly on the sick man's body. Predicted biophysical signs are made to appear, often the by-product of the therapy rather than of the disease, and only explicable biophysical outcomes are allowed to occur. It is useful to reintroduce the notion of catharsis at this point. Anthropologists generally use this term to refer to a discharge of emotion attaching to repressed experience. However, catharsis can also imply increased suggestibility. After a period of repeated abreactions, individuals "respond more willingly when he [the therapist] attempts to implant new ideas in them, or new interpretations of old ideas, which they would have rejected without hesitation before" (Sargent 1957:52). Catharsis in this second sense can occur during possession experiences, but it can also be produced during episodes involving intense anxiety, fevers, and physical debilities brought on by sickness and by harsh therapies such as violent purges and emetics (see Sargent 1957:13-24, 133). I have argued that possession-centered descriptions treat illness as an ancillary problem in analysing cults, when in fact it is a central concern of cult members, and that a more complete analysis of these cults is hindered by an ambiguous or reductionistic use of the concept of catharsis. A third flaw of possession-centered descriptions is that they make it difficult to understand fully how cult members win the ability to extort gifts and deference. Cult membership gives these advantages when spirits cause a devotee to become ill and demand valuables as the price for a cure. The sick person must obtain the valuables from her relatives, and she must subsequently wear or use them. But possession-centered accounts generally assume that (1) an isomorphic relationship exists among symptoms, etiology, and disease name, so that once the appropriate symptoms appear it is inevitable that the sick person will be initiated, (2) the initiatory ailment is important mainly because it legitimizes and rationalizes possession states, and (3) it is sufficient to see these events from the point of view of the devotee. We shall see later in this paper that the ostensibly typical spirit-caused syndrome may be ambiguous from an ethno-diagnostic point of view, because it can also be traced to agents other than cult spirits. In these circumstances, it is as important for us to know how people resolve this ambiguity (i.e., what the diagnostic choices are and how the principals choose among them) as it is to know how the subsequent demands of the disease-causing spirits are learned and met (i.e., the focus of possession-centered analysis). This is particularly important in the case of initiatory ailments, where it is often the choice of a diagnostician of type X rather than of types Y or Z that governs whether or not the sick person will be directed to a possession cult for therapy and its "inevitable" consequences. In instances where participation in the cult is a strategy for extorting attention and desiderata, sickness episodes constitute an arena in which the would-be devotee competes against the people who control the assets she desires. As the competition takes place among the Amhara, the sick person's important advantage lies in her ability to generate new evidence, often learned in dreams, which implicates possession spirits. Her competitor's (e.g., husband's) advantage is that he can buy the services of healers who can prove rival etiologies. Possession states usually appear only later, once the woman has won the competition, and she is in the hands of a shaman-healer. Most devotees must be taught an Ethiopian zar cult 569</page><page sequence="4">how to be possessed, and much of the training takes place while (and, perhaps, is effective because) the devotee is undergoing a prolonged regimen of strong purges and sleep-inducing medicaments to rid her of the initiatory ailment. A final point I want to make is that emphasis on the adaptive functions of possession cults should not obscure the fact that there are members for whom the cult is imperfectly adaptive. Lewis (1971:196) has called attention to the "refractory psychotics and schizophrenics" for whom membership can mean little more than a modification of secondary symptoms. There are also non-psychotic members for whom the possession cult is no more adaptive than was the cult of the dominant moral order. They gain no lever for extorting favors, and they find that one set of unmanageable forces has only been replaced by another. In order to understand how these "accidents" happen, we must begin with the epidemiological beliefs and diagnostic notions which point new members toward the initiatory ailment. Further, membership in possession cults, at least where it is maladaptive, is not always so permanent as anthropologists sometimes assume (e.g., Messing 1959:331). We shall see later that when the spirits of the dominant moral order are able to reassert themselves over cult members, forcing them to break with the possession cult, sickness episodes are an effective vehicle for the exercise of their authority. The following sections concentrate on the medical aspects of belonging to the Amhara zar possession cult. The discussion is in four parts: an outline of the cult's operation, a description of its initiatory ailment (kureynya), a comparison of the rival cures and contrasting etiologies that are communicated and confirmed during the diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome, and the medical biographies of two cult members. the Amhara zar cult The Amhara are Ethiopian monophysite Christians who live mainly in the central and northern provinces of Shoa, Gojam, Wollo, and Begemder. Amhara men are traditionally farmers, ecclesiastics, government functionaries, soldiers, and petty traders. Artisan occupations are derogated to Muslims, Falashas (Jews), and endogamous Christian minorities (leatherworkers, gold and silversmiths). In this article I am writing about Amhara who live in the region around Gondar, the capital of Begemder province. Although only 6 percent of Begemder's people live in towns with populations of more than 2,000 people, urbanism is well established in Ethiopia. Gondar was founded in the seventeenth century and its Axumite origins go back two millennia. Amhara towns are interesting demographically because of the numerical predominance of townswomen. In Begemder they constitute nearly 70 percent of townsfolk over the age of fifteen (Imp. Eth. Gov. Cen. Stat. Off. 1972:41, 46-48). Most of these women earn their living in beer houses and mead halls and as prostitutes, serving townsmen and peasants who travel to the town's weekly markets. The zar cult is found in Somalia, Ethiopia, the Sudan Republic, Egypt, and Arabia (Trimingham 1965:258). The cult is not a unitary phenomenon throughout this area, however, and there are important ritual and cosmological differences from place to place. The first published descriptions of the zar cult among Begemder Amhara dates from 1932 when Marcel Griaule and Michel Leiris visited Gondar (Leiris 1933, 1934a, 1934b, 1935, 1938, 1958; Rodinson 1967). Several nineteenth-century accounts of life in Christian Lthiopia refer to similar beliefs and practices, but they lack cult-like characteristics. Nathaniel Pearce and Mansfield Parkyns reported spirits called tigritiya which cause 570 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="5">mainly women to become sick and be possessed. As with today's zars, possession was induced by a head-swinging and torso-bending dance; the spirits demanded silver ornaments and the clothes and accoutrements of men, particularly of warriors; possession took place in settings of feasting, music, and animal sacrifices, which the spirits extorted as a condition for withdrawing disease symptoms. Unlike the zar cult, however, the goal of these practices was to exorcise the spirits, and no "congregation" developed around them (Pearce 1831:290-295; Parkyns 1853:162-168; see also Worrel 1909:20-22, 34; and Trimingham 1952:28). During this same period, it appears that the zar cult already existed among Amhara living further south, in Shoa province (Harris 1844:297; Strelcyn 1955:lxi-lxii) 334). By mid-century, the term "zar" was being used in Begemder to describe ecstatic spirits, although the practices in this connection were still close to those associated with the tigritiya and did not yet constitute a cult (Stern 1862:160-161). By the twentieth century, the zar cult was well established among Begemder Amhara. The tigritiya, on the other hand, have lost their epidemiological prominence and ecstatic character. They no longer command a unique therapy, and people now tend to assimilate them into a more generic class of spirits, the ganels (Messing 1957:679, 688-689; Young 1970:Ch. 1). There also seems to have been a reduction in the incidence of similar ecstatic ailments which had afflicted many women in the nineteenth century (see Stern 1862:1 54-1 59). The zar cult in Begemder today is the product of already existing beliefs and practices (e.g., those associated with the tigritiya) and of elements originating with the Agaw, Galla, and Islamic neighbors of the Amhara.2 The latter influences are seen in the names of the zars, the argot of the zar devotees, the ritual and medical use of chat (catha edulis), and the ritual use of the sacrificial animal's peritoneum and the drinking of its blood (Dimotheos 1871:141; Worrel 1909:30; Leiris 1938:123-124; Leslau 1949; Trimingham 1952:258-259; Rodinson 1967:71; Gamst 1969:49-50). The zar cult continues to under- go a process of cultural adaptation or amharization, through which its beliefs and practices are rationalized with Amhara cosmological and medical ideas (cf. Trimingham 1952:27-28). For example, Leiris' informants referred to zar shamans as awoliya a word which he traces to the Arabic waliy, 'saint' (Leiris 1934a:101; Leslau 1949:210-211). By 1966, this term had been assimilated to the Amharic word awakiy (literally, 'knowl- edgable'), meaning, when it is used by itself, "anyone who can cure or divine with the help of spirit familiars." In this way, the shaman's public has identified him with an appropriate taxonomy (i.e., healing) and has made him comparable with fellow specialists. Some male shamans have contributed to this process by taking the title aleka before their names-formerly the term was used mainly for cleric healers and certain ecclesiastical officers-and by adopting or shamming the astrological-numerological divining techniques that previously had been the monopoly of cleric healers. A person joins the zar cult because she (or he) has been chosen by a zar. Almost always the zar's intention is signaled by sickness. The diagnosis is made by azar shaman assisted by his or her zar familiars. Shaman and client work toward two goals at this time. First, they must regularize the relationship between the zar and its victim by learning who the zar is and what it demands in return for removing the sickness. The shaman requires a period of one or two weeks, sometimes longer, to accomplish this task. While many zars reveal their identities and demands rapidly and explicitly, so that their victims are sick for only a short time, others are unresponsive or deceptive and prefer to torment their victims. Throughout much of this period, the shaman keeps his client sleeping or semi- comatose by making her drink decoctions of chat and honey. Second, the shaman must expel the purely physical aspects of the sickness which the zar has inflicted. The two an Ethiopian zar cult 571</page><page sequence="6">goals must be pursued simultaneously, and there can be no cure unless both goals are ach ieved. Typically, the initiand must first learn a pre-possession dance called gurri, during which the zar mounts his human "horse" (feres). If successful, gurri gives way to the zar's fukura, a traditional praise song in which the zar reveals his name, details about his character, and what demands he is making. Some initiands never succeed in attaining the praise song stage and must depend on the shaman to learn the necessary information about their zars. Once someone has been initiated into the cult, she can expect to be possessed in two settings: At periodic meetings of the shaman's coterie (hadra), devotees perform a collective dance for the zars. A devotee attends these sessions because her zar desires this and she wants to learn the conditions for her improvement. Moreover, most devotees enjoy the music, dancing, and feasting of the sessions. While possessed, devotees assume the character (and often the dress) or their zars, and women are frequently obliged to adopt aggressive male roles (warriors, hunters). Leiris (1958) has commented at length on the important theatrical and aesthetic aspects of these sessions and on the tendency of some devotees to parody legal and religious forms practiced in the larger society. Devotees are also sometimes possessed on occasions other than coterie meetings. This is particularly likely during the zars' two great celebrations, at the beginning of the new year and at the end of Lent. The zars demand from their devotees ornaments, clothes, perfume, incense, foods, and animals sacrifices. Two kinds of sacrifices are made to zars. When members of the coterie offer a collective sacrifice (generally an ox), it is called makwadasha, and it is intended to propitiate the zar without reference to any specific action by him. A devotee who seeks to free himself from a sickness caused by a zar performs a sacrifice known as derka, which usually consists of a chicken bearing the color and markings favored by the zar. When the derka is performed, a second sacrifice sometimes supplements it. This is called denkero, and its intention is to draw off the disease substance (bashiyta) rather than to appeal to the responsible zar. The denkero is made out-of-doors, and, unlike the other sacrifices, it is never eaten. Instead, it is thrown by the roadside, from which place it will eventually cause some passer-by to become sick (see Leiris 1935). Very often, herbal therapies, generally strong emetics and purges, either take the place of or supplement the denkero sacrifice. A devotee attracts additional zars throughout her lifetime. While some return only very infrequently, most visit regularly in dreams and through possession, so she ac- cumulates a set of zars with whom she has on-going communication. Each of these zars is named and recognized according to (1) important status dimensions of Amhara society- age, sex, religion, and occupation, (2) his characteristic temperament and his attitude toward the humans who are bound to him, whether he is capricious or predictable, cruel or moderate, (3) his authority and power among the zars, (4) the kinds of demands he makes in return for removing disease symptoms (cf. Leiris 1934a:120; Messing 1958:1124). The shaman is distinguished by the zars who belong to his set and by the special ties he enjoys with some of them. A shaman claims ties to many zars; some of them are cooperative spirits which have the ability to coerce weaker zars into desired courses of action. It is these zars who are believed to teach him herbal therapies, and it is they who enable him to divine for non-devotees on matters of personal interest, unrelated to the zars. In contrast to the shaman's favorable situation, the zars of an ordinary devotee are uninfluential, uninformative, and uncooperative about matters lying outside their own dyadic relationship. 572 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="7">The coterie is often the group within which a devotee finds her most important social relationships beyond the family. It is in the towns, where most devotees are unmarried women who earn their living (and support the children who live with them) as beer vendors and prostitutes, that they depend most on their coteries for sociability and support in the face of misfortune. From a medical point of view, also, the longer a devotee participates in the cult, the fewer reasons she has for looking beyond the coterie. She comes to explain all of her serious physical ailments according to the zars' displeasure and her good health according to their indulgence, and she finds all of her prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic needs fulfilled by the shaman.3 the kureynya sickness The literal meaning of kureynya is 'a creditor.' Devotees use the term to signify ail- ments caused by zars.4 The metaphor is obvious, because in earlier times a man could chain his debtor to his wrist until the debt could be paid back (Perham 1969:143). The simplest form of kureynya is marked by malaise, listlessness, chronic stomach pain, and headache. Amhara find this syndrome very ambiguous, since it can be explained by any of the following five etiologies: (1) Certain excesses of commonplace activities (especially emotion and fasting) disrupt the equilibrium of body organs necessary for good health (tena). (2) Sickness may occur when someone touches, ingests, or even breathes into the body innocuous substances that have been contaminated by contact with a sun-borne miasma (gerifta) or with animals or spirits whose bodies are poisonous (likift). (3) People are poisoned by their enemies. (4) Some humans (usually endogamous iron workers) can introject their cannibalistic spirit aspects, known as buda, into their victims. (5) Zar spirits, ganel-demons, and sorcerers can cause a variety of misfortunes, especially internal ailments. All five etiologies can produce a core of symptoms consisting of internal discomfort and malaise. Each etiology adds additional symptoms to produce a named syndrome that is typical of it. For example, headache is characteristic of kureynya. However, the physi- ological mechanisms of the five etiologies are so similar that any one etiology can produce the typical syndromes of the other four (see Young 1970:Ch. 1). Further, zars and demons sometimes intentionally produce syndromes that are typically associated with other pathogenic agencies. A sick man's syndrome loses its ambiguity through professional diagnosis. Healers capable of treating kureynya-like ailments can be sorted into secular healers and spirit healers, according to shared professional titles (see Young 1970:27-32): (1) The herbalist relies on purges and emetics to expel pathogenic substances and wasted tissues from the sick man's body. His etiological domain is limited to excesses of commonplace activities and contaminating substances. (2) There are three types of spirit healers. The shaman is a man or woman who can oblige powerful zar familiars to exert their authority over the other disease-causing zars. The atmakiy is a priest who baptizes the sick man with sanctified water which repels demons. The debtera-healer is a cleric, a liturgical singer, who expels pathogens with medicaments and the help of the spirits of the Church. A minority of debtera-healers (the ganel sabiy) also command the help of demons. The debtera is competent in all etiologies except for zar; the atmakiy-baptizer is limited to ailments caused by demons; and the shaman primarily treats ailments caused by zars. Through his choice of healers, the sick person weighs the chances that a particular etiology or explanation will be proven for his sickness episode. Each category of healer an Ethiopian zar cult 573</page><page sequence="8">tends to work within a distinctive etiological domain. A curer's diagnosis and therapy do not consider all etiological possibilities, and he can only validate his favored explanation or show that it is irrelevant to the episode. The herbalist, atmakiy-baptizer, debtera, and zar shaman are neither equally desirable choices nor equally feasible ones, if the social and material costs of their respective cures are considered. The search for a cure usually begins with an herbalist because his fees are moderate, he usually lives near the sick man's own hamlet, and he offers therapy under conditions that little disturb his client's ties to family and community. Like the sick man he treats, the herbalist is usually a farmer, indistinguishable from his fellows except for his curing. His healing powers are mechanical and narrowly defined. Unlike the spirit healers, he lacks any generic power that would enable him to cure all ailments falling within his etiological domain, or to divine, give prophylaxis, and send misfortune. He knows a single prosaic technique, how to expel an inanimate foreign substance from his client's body in order to restore its equilibrium. Few herbalists offer professional cures for more than two or three different ailments. While an Amhara knows the herbal specialties of most of the people of his own parish or ward, he knows the names of few herbalists beyond this range, and he must rely on the chance that a kinsman or neighbor can help with information or that a local herbalist knows of a more expert colleague in his own specialty. Once the local herbalists prove ineffective, the sick man must usually consult a spirit healer. Obscurity is never a problem in locating spirit healers. The shaman is the focal point for zar-possessed folk over a wide region, and his reputation is made public through this network. The reputation of the debtera is disseminated by both his ecclesiastical students and a wide circle of clients for whom he divines and provides prophylaxis for all sorts of misfortunes. Finally, while atmakiy-baptizers are anonymous, the healing springs (tebel) or churches to which they are tied are famous in large areas. Equally significant, there is no question as to whether a particular spirit healer is competent to treat a particular ailment, for it is assumed that the healer, through his access to a general source of power, can treat all of the ailments that fall within his etiological domain. Although any one of the three healers is an etiologically correct choice after herbalist therapy proves ineffec- tive or unobtainable, the atmakiy-baptizer is generally considered a desperate hope, worth considering only after other choices have failed. His works offer a poor prognosis, and only the excessively pious sick man, who categorically rejects the debtera because of his demonic associations and the shaman because he is anathemized by the Church, would turn to an atmakiy-baptizer immediately after the herbalist's failure. Most sick men are reduced, then, to two alternatives-the debtera and the zar shaman- both of whom share important characteristics. Both (laymen believe) derive the power to cure from spirit familiars; both engage these familiars in privileged dialogue and either persuade or oblige them into desired action; for both, the power to cure is only one aspect of a more general power to influence men's lives; and both can transfer account- ability for the sick man's ailment onto human or anthropomorphic agencies. But there are also two important differences that set the shaman off from the debtera. The shaman's etiology entails consequences that mean radical social and ontological changes for the sick man, but the resources needed to conduct this etiology are very modest. On the other hand, the debtera's etiology has socially conservative consequences, but in order to carry it out the sick man needs greater resources than many potential clients possess. A sick Amhara does not consult one category of healer and reject another because he is consciously oriented toward specific goals, of course. His aim is medical, to find a cure, and the choice between the zar shaman and the debtera rests mainly on epidemiological indications. It is common knowledge that the zars prefer women and the poor. Also, 574 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="9">when a devotee dies, her zars are often inherited by a relative because the spirits prefer to have replacements come from among people whom they already know well. Typically, the line of inheritance is from a woman to the offspring who was physically and emotion- ally closest to her (see Leiris 1934b:131, 1938:116, 120). Thus the most reasonable choice for someone whose mother was a devotee is to consult a shaman. Once someone has suffered an episode of kureynya, it becomes epidemiologically less reasonable for her to look for agents other than zars as the causes of her serious sicknesses or to employ therapies other than those of the zar shaman. On the other hand, the expense of the debtera's cure is significant not only because it is beyond the means of many of the shaman's clients, but also because the kind of man who can afford it is the kind of man for whom the debtera's etiologies (particularly the possibility of sorcery) make the most sense.5 zars and rival spirits Episodes of kureynya make abstract but ontologically important ideas tangible and apprehensible within a comprehensive cultural system (see Singer 1972:71-74). In order to interpret these shaman-managed performances, we, like the Amhara layman, must contrast them with episodes of kureynya-like syndromes that are managed by rival healers. Healers tend to use unique etiologies, and an Amhara who chooses a "wrong" healer incurs unnecessary expense and, because of the passage of time, a less favorable prognosis. Before a layman can select a healer for a kureynya-like syndrome, then, he considers rival etiologies and their epidemiological indications. The way in which Amhara compare the shaman with the debtera-healer can be diagrammed as follows: GANEL SABIY - -AWAKIY---v- SHAMAN (demon-pulling debtera) (healer with familiars) TINISH DEBTERA - -TONKWAY--- SHAMAN ('minor debtera') (seer) The source of the debtera's power, as far as laymen understand it, are his demon familiars.6 Demons are earthbound spirits which are organized into a hierarchy of named commanders and anonymous subordinates. The supreme demon is the fallen angel Seytenael (Lucifer); his lieutenants live in the lakes, rivers, and on the mountain tops of Ethiopia. A multitude of subordinate demons stalk the forests, hearth ashes, and nocturnal landscape, ready to strike adventitiously or to carry out the directions of demon commanders, who are sometimes under the control of debtera sorcerers. Demons are very dangerous and indiscriminately pathogenic. From nighttime ambush, they strike blows which bring apoplexy and epilepsy, and even indirect contact with them causes sickness (likift). Madness and chronic incapacitating anxiety afflict people who have seen a demon, and if the glance is returned the effects are fatal. Both the demon-calling debtera and the shaman are anathematized by the Church. The one sins by dealing with forces pledged to its destruction, the other through false belief. The meaning of their offenses runs deeper than this, however. While the Church defines the demons as its enemies, their destructive power is the indispensable stuff of divine an Ethiopian zar cult 575</page><page sequence="10">sanctions. Although the goodness of divine power is perfect, divine intentions are realized not only through the promise of grace, but also by the threat of sanctions (mekseft). Christians are protected by angel guardians (maliket) in the command of the Almighty. Divine displeasure is expressed by depriving the sinner or his children of the guardians. Once a breach is opened in these defenses, demons are certain to attack, since they pursue their destructive goals compulsively, striking wherever the opportunity arises. In its "un- socialized" form, then, the power of demons is amoral, for it is indiscriminate. It becomes moral when it is affected by divine will. It is the shadow of divine grace that gives to the secular and ecclesiastical hierarchies of the Ethiopian state their ultimate claims to legiti- macy. The debtera "short-circuits" this power to demonstrate its pragmatic and individ- ualistic applications. The demons he manipulates are uniform, and their power is formless and undifferentiated. They are described as soldiers or slaves (bariya, after their Nilotic appearance), the mindless and depersonalized implementers of the plans and intentions of men who are cunning and determined enough to use them. In the dramaturgy of his diagnoses and cures, the debtera labors in a milieu reduced to manly strategies and sentiments. By means of a combination of compulsion (through magic) and blandish- ments (through sacrifice), the debtera obliges commander demons to cooperate. It is dangerous work, since the commander demon is prideful and imperious and resents being called from his rest to be placed under painful magical restraints (Young 1970:Ch. 5). Finally, the debtera's power flows entirely according to the great divisions set by Amhara society. It is forbidden to the non-Christian, and, because of the costs of the debtera's therapy, it is unavailable to the poor. By communicating his unique etiology during diagnosis and by confirming it through his therapy and its aftermath, the debtera defines the power which infuses the moral order of Amhara society, and he relates his client to its sources. He enables the client to coalesce diffuse attitudes about his situation into morally acceptable strategies, which include striking back at his enemies or putting him- self beyond their power or interest through magical means or flight. The differences between the zars and the spirits of the dominant moral order are not adventitious. The community of the zars and their devotees persists because it adapts dialectically to the larger society and because devotees can make sense out of the zars by using the ideas they bring with them into the cult. Participation in the cult reshapes the devotee's mazeway by transforming relations between people and transcendental powers, rather than creating altogether new ones. In contrast to the demons, the zars have ordinary human forms. Their spirit community duplicates the ethnic types found in Ethiopian society, and individual zars are known by their social and personal characteris- tics (unlike the demons). Most devotees are uncertain how religion, caste, and social status are dealt with in the zar world, however. They use the central creation myth of the dominant moral order, the story of Adam and Eve, to explain the origin of the zars.7 As they tell the story, Eve had many children with Adam. She feared that when the Al- mighty saw them He would claim the most beautiful for Himself. Thus, when He came she brought forward only the homely children. The Almighty was not deceived and banished the beautiful children from the world of real people. The descendants of the beautiful children are the zars, and it is their beauty, devotees say, which is reflected in the face of a person when she recovers from her initiatory episode of kureynya. As it appears in the Old Testament, this myth also legitimizes the sexual order of Amhara society: Eve is the unreflecting instrument of Satan, and her act brings suffering to mankind.8 In the story of Eve and the zar children, Eve demonstrates the assertiveness and initiative that are conventionally associated with men: she is an autonomous agent; it is the Almighty Himself she attempts to deceive; she is punished less for violating the 576 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="11">rules than for arousing envy; and the consequence of her act is to create a new social order. The myth illustrates an earlier point of mine about the psychic rewards mediated through the zars. Devotees are bound to transcendental powers with ego-supportive per- sonalities, and they act out aggressive behavior ordinarily denied to them. The obverse argument can also be made. While entry into the cult has radical consequences for every devotee, men and women are affected differently. For most men, the shaman's therapy means an insufferable social transformation. The Church contends that the zars are really demons bent on deluding people into false belief, but most Amhara have no doubt that zars form a distinct category of spirits. Nevertheless, the ecclesiastical position excludes devotees from the pivot of parish life, its church; it is both a sign and a cause of the reasons men favor the more conservative programs provided by the debtera. Recruitment to political leadership in the parish is frequently through the priesthood, and the higher a man stands in the local community, the more disrespectful it is to suggest that his life has been connected in any way with the zars. Because notions of manly behavior are also central to Amhara morality, men believe that the devotee's everyday life is a miserable degradation. An Amhara man, unless he is a monk, is expected to covet the land, riches, patrons, and allies that are the means to social power and prestige. He believes that other men are driven by the same impulses, that they will inevitably challenge him for these desiderata, and that serious enemies are the unavoidable consequences of manly assertive- ness. To gain what he desires, he must manipulate superior forces and persons and dominate inferior ones. To male outsiders, the devotee's life inverts these values by withdrawing him from the arena of social action and by reducing him to a "horse" which the spirits can mount and drive or chastise whenever it suits them. Amhara men conceive of the social order as a simple hierarchy of social relations organized according to differences in rank, religion, occupation, sex, and race. Respect- able Amhara are politically and morally superior to other categories of people. Beneath them are endogamous Christian artisans; after these come the Arabs, Abyssinian Muslims, Agaw pagans, Nilotes, and Falasha. The differences among these peoples are com- municated through residential segregation, peculiarities of dress, group endogamy, and the tendency of respectable Christians to limit their dealing with other sorts of people to a particularistic, money nexus. Because Amhara men value these distinctions, they con- sider the zar devotee humiliated by his inability to maintain them. In azar coterie, men and women, respectable townsfolk and lowly gatherers of firewood, Christians and non- Christians mix together without special privileges or special disabilities, and together they rely on the advice and mediation of the shaman, who is sometimes a Muslim and often a woman. Further, because there are as many kinds of zars as there are Ethiopians, and because these spirits act without concern for propriety, it is inevitable that every male devotee will count women, Muslims, and even more derogated types among the zars that command his deference and obedience and that force on him, at least for the span of coterie meetings, their peculiar behavior and even dress. Finally, entrance into a zar coterie is a public act, since the zars always demand some overt sign of a devotee's fealty. At the very least, they demand that each devotee wear a stripe of their special color on the hem of the normally all-white toga. Kureynya-like syndromes are also caused by cannibalistic were-hyena spirits (budas). Certain herbalists can treat this sickness, and their therapy contrasts with the cures of shamans and debteras. While most herbalists lack the etiological and dramaturgical means to demonstrate important ideas, the expert curer for were-hyena sickness (yibuda medhaniyt awakiy) is an exception. In its most complete form, his therapy evokes the an Ethiopian zar cult 577</page><page sequence="12">were-hyena spirit and forces it to describe why it attacked the sick person. The possessed patient usually resists vigorously and must be physically restrained. A combination of near-suffocating fumitories and persistent interrogation forces the spirit to agree to leave his victim, and it is then flushed out with purgatives and emetics. The herbalist's treatment contrasts the circumscribed and prosaic powers of laymen with the generic and transcendental powers that are mediated by the spirit healers.9 The herbalist calls up a spirit which is sub-human rather than super-human, and one whose power has no socialized form. The were-hyena is an animal-man in his spirit aspect and a Falasha in his social aspect. His acts are compulsive attempts to satisfy an immediate and basic physical urge, usually hunger or thirst. His energies are squandered on socially insignificant objects, since most of his victims are children and young women and are usually unknown to him. the medical careers of two devotees Although zar devotees are usually socially peripheral people, there are important dif- ferences among them in the ways in which they are peripheral. For example, the extortive strategy is unimportant for most devotees in towns, where women are usually socially and economically autonomous. These differences influence which adaptive strategies devotees will favor. In order to learn how the adaptive strategies are employed, it is necessary to understand the role of illnesses caused by spirits. Below I quote two narratives which illustrate four strategically important characteristics of zar-caused sickness: (1) The devotee experiences the symptoms of the initiatory ailment for some time before it is decided to consult a shaman. During this time, rival etiologies are considered. (2) A kureynya diagnosis is likely to be contested when some member of the sick person's household possesses the resources necessary to follow an alternative cure and wants to avoid a zar diagnosis. The challenge to a kureynya diagnosis can occur during both the initiatory ailment and subsequent episodes. (3) After initiation, each subsequent change in the devotee's relations with the spirits is marked by a sickness episode. In instances where the cult enables a devotee to achieve a more manageable subjective reality, sickness episodes are a vehicle for bringing about lasting changes in how she perceives her world and a means for convincing her that these changed perceptions are true and extrinsic to herself. No one learns or confirms her mazeway in a once-and-for-all event, and it must be continually recommunicated to her and reconfirmed by her throughout her life. Kureynya-like episodes are important in this connection for the following reasons: They are usable because they are recurrent and affect everyone. They are informative because they can communicate complex information via their etiologies, and their messages are coherent and stand out against the quotidian background. Finally, they are convincing because they are cathartic, in the special sense described above, and they confirm their predictions in the. real world. From the point of view of Western medical taxonomy, episodes of zar-caused sickness include both hysterical conversions and ailments attribut- able to biophysical causes. It is not necessary to make this distinction if we want to study the socially and psychologically adaptive nature of such cults, since both kinds of episodes work in the same way. The following biographies are narrative accounts obtained from the principals. My annotations appear within parentheses. (1) (Zemmemu is a poor townswoman living in Gondar. She supports herself and the three children who live with her mainly by setting the elaborate coiffures of her beer vendor neighbors.) Zemmemu grew up in a rural parish, where her mother, father (a poor 578 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="13">tenant farmer), mother's mother, and mother's brother lived. Her mother's mother was a zar shaman who, assisted at first by her son and later by her daughters, supported herself by divining. When the old woman was close to death, she told her son that her zars had chosen him to replace her. At this time he was a regular congregant at the parish church and the head of a family and had no wish to become a devotee. But after his mother died, he fell seriously ill and zars appeared in his dreams to tell him of their anger. He accepted the zars' domination and, at their instigation, moved to Gondar, in whose weekly market he had traded in sheep. Eventually, his zars enabled him to divine. When Zemmemu was a girl of eleven or twelve her mother, also a devotee, sent her to live with her uncle in Gondar. She had been living with him for two years when he died. According to Zem- memu, he was slain by his zars because he had quarreled with a member of his coterie over their respective rights to a sheep the devotee had sacrificed. (The zars dislike quar- relling, and their attitude is believed to explain why vicious or choleric personalities grow more moderate after initiation.) Zemmemu continued to live with her uncle's wife for another year, until a marriage was arranged for her with a petty trader. Even before she had come to Gondar, Zemmemu had suffered from chronic fatigue and joint pain. While at her uncle's house, she began to suffer frequent fainting spells, also. During the year following her uncle's death, she had a series of dreams in which she found herself waking up on a bed of the aromatic grass with which devotees cover their floors for important zar celebrations. Sometime after her marriage, as it turned out on a feast day of the zars, she was walking through Gondar's crowded market when she felt an acute pain in her chest and back and fell into a faint. Later that day she recovered consciousness, but the pain lingered on. Several days later, she dreamt that an insect had flown into her nose and that she had struggled violently but unsuccessfully to remove it. A large bird had then flown down and had sat on her head. She suspected that this was a zar dream. She discussed it with her husband, and they agreed that Zemmemu should consult a local shaman. After the shaman's cure, Zemmemu remained an active member of his coterie, and in time she attracted seven more zars. Two of the spirits introduced themselves through episodes of serious illness. In the one instance, her sickness was preceded by a series of dreams in which she slept in a field while a leopard gnawed at her side. She considered these dreams to be particularly ominous. (It is female zars who assume the shape of predatory carnivores. These zars are feared because they are always angry, demanding, and difficult to please, and often treat their mounts very cruelly.) Not long after the dreams, Zemmemu developed a combination of bad chills, fever, and body pain. On the occasions when her zars afflicted her with the ordinary symptoms of kureynya, Zemmemu prepared herbal medicines she had learned in her uncle's house and, wearing the necklace of blue glass rings and silver ornaments dedicated to Gwardey, the Amhara hunter zar, or the necklace of tiny red, blue, white, and green beads and the gauze veil worn in honor of Mafoodey, a Muslim female zar, or the sash trimmed in green and red for Shankit, the Nilotic servant zar, and in the company of her devotee neighbors, she served the zars their favorite foods and clapped and drummed for them throughout the night. For several days after such celebrations Zemmemu wore her zar jewelry because the zars find this pleasing. Zemmemu also celebrated this way after dreams in which her zars appeared to be angry with her. Her husband was a marginal provider and came to resent the expense of Zemmemu's zars. His resentment came to a head at the time of her last successful pregnancy. (Pregnancies are very dangerous events for devotees, since they arouse the zars' jealousy. The zars expect no special gift when a woman first learns that she is pregnant; unless they an Ethiopian zar cult 579</page><page sequence="14">have forbidden the woman to become pregnant or to have sexual relations, devotees generally do no more than ask their shamans for a medicine to prevent miscarriage. As the time of delivery draws near, however, the zars expect to be provided with sheep for sacrifice, coffee, nug oil, beer, porridge, sweet smelling grass, and incense.) When Zem- memu asked her husband to help her to obtain these necessary offerings, he refused. Soon after her child was born, one of Zemmemu's zars came to her in a dream. He was very angry and told her that the baby would fall mortally ill, that she would be unable to help it, and that she was forbidden to ask the shaman to intercede for her. The baby died two months later. Zemmemu's second husband was a wood-carrier (a very humble occupation). He was a devotee and helped Zemmemu prepare coffee and foods for her zars. But soon after he made her pregnant, they parted. Her last pregnancy has turned out to be a very trouble- some one also. When her menses ceased and her abdomen swelled, Zemmemu knew that she was pregnant. But her abdomen failed to grow as fully distended as it had during previous pregnancies, and, although she had been pregnant for fifteen months, labor had yet to begin. Zemmemu was certain that her zars were not allowing her child to be born, although they had not yet revealed their intentions. She has inherited one of her uncle's cooperative zars (which he had inherited from his mother) and wonders whether the arrested pregnancy will turn out to be a sign that the zars are preparing to demand that she, like her grandmother and uncle before her, must renounce sexual activity and take up a diviner's life. (2) (Bosana is the daughter of a prosperous farmer, a respected man in his parish, and the descendant of one of its original landowning families. In addition to his own fields, he has the use of a parcel of Church land, and his eldest son is a priest in the parish church. Bosana's husband is a young Amhara farmer and also a member of a respectable land- owning family.) After the birth of her first child, it became evident that Bosana was not well. Although she spoke of no physical complaints, she was apathetic and uncommunica- tive. One night, Bosana startled her husband with loud wailing. She appeared to be asleep, but attempts to arouse her failed, and her cries continued until dawn. Her father sus- pected that she was the victim of a buda were-hyena because lassitude and hyena-like calls are the frequent prodromes of buda possession. Her husband decided to visit an herbalist who lived nearby. The herbalist agreed that Bosana's trouble seemed to be a buda, and he gave him an herbal inhalant. Bosana's condition improved rapidly, but after several weeks she suffered a relapse. The earlier symptoms returned, and, in addition, Boasana now complained of internal pains, she was unable to keep food down, and her nose bled frequently. (These, too, are typical buda possession prodromes.) So far as her husband and father were concerned, the new symptoms were conclusive evidence that Bosana was afflicted by a were-hyena. Once more the herbalist was consulted. In addition to the inhalant, he gave a botanical to be burned as a fumitory whenever Bosana cried out during the night. After a week of this therapy Bosana had grown only weaker, and there was talk of consulting a more powerful herbalist or even a debtera who would exorcise the buda with purgative and fumitories. Before a final decision could be made, Bosana revealed that she had dreamt during the last few nights of a man dressed as a peasant. He had been very angry and had demanded that Bosana sacrifice a sheep and that she buy silver ornaments and glass beads which he described for her. While the meaning of the dream seemed to be clear-the sickness was the work of a zar and not a buda-both Bosana's husband and father were reluctant to accept its implications. So far as anyone knew or was willing to admit, there had never been any devotees in their families. They 580 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="15">talked of taking her to a demon-calling debtera to be exorcised, but, in the end, Bosana was taken to a shaman. After Bosana had stayed with the shaman for several weeks, the shaman told her that her zar was satisfied with her and that she could leave. Not long after she had returned home, it became apparent that her husband, under the influence of an evangelist monk who was visiting in his parish, had come to see things differently. Over the next several months, he grew more and more insistent, demanding that Bosana refrain from the company of other devotees and that she discard all of the jewelry and clothes that she had dedicated to her zar. At the new year feast day for the zars, her husband refused to allow Bosana to celebrate either at the shaman's house or privately in her own household. At his insistence, Bosana began visiting the monk regularly. The combination of the monk's arguments and her husband's vehemence eventually forced her to admit her error and agree to her husband's demands. Bosana's zar, a Muslim named Adal Mohammed, had never appeared in her dreams when she was at the shaman's house. And although he mounted her at several coterie celebrations, he had done little more than to ride her during the dancing and clapping and had never chosen to speak through her. Whatever Bosana had learned about him during those days had come from the shaman. Her conversations with other initiands and devotees were mainly about the sorts of things their spirits were demanding from them. Soon after she returned home, however, Adal Mohammed visited her in a dream. During the next few months, he reappeared frequently, but he asked for nothing, and even when the zar celebration came and went without Bosana's participation, he had reacted in no special way. The night after Bosana destroyed the ornaments and clothes dedicated to him, Adal Mohammed appeared to her in a rage. His skin, normally light in complexion, was black with anger. He reminded Bosana that he had almost killed her once and that she would suffer again for her behavior. Bosana was very frightened by this dream, and soon afterwards she was overcome by lassitude and afflicted with internal pains and headache. These symptoms persisted through the spring and summer, and during this period she also lost the sight of both of her eyes. Bosana pleaded with her husband that he allow her to visit the shaman once more, but he remained adamant in the belief that only through the Church could she be helped. He took her to a celebrated church on the outskirts of Gondar where an atmakiy-baptizer sprinkled her with sanctified water. When they returned home, Bosana prayed incessantly for several weeks, appealing to the Almighty to save her eyes. In the end, she regained sight in one eye. Although she now accepts the fact that she is no longer a zar devotee, Bosana remains convinced that is was indeed Adal Mohammed who took an eye from her. Her explanation is that it was because of her lack of faith in the Almighty that this zar had been allowed to harm her. (Bosana's understanding of what has happened is hetero- doxical from the point of view of both her husband, a spokesman for extreme orthodoxy, and devotees. While her experiences have affirmed the existence of zars, she has managed to assimilate them to the normal role of demons.) summary and conclusions I have tried to trace how certain social and psychic advantages that an Amhara gains from belonging to a zar coterie are related to the reasons she has for joining and remain- ing a member of it. The main points of my argument have been the following. A woman's conscious motive for joining a coterie is always medical-she is seeking an Ethiopian zar cult 581</page><page sequence="16">remission from a zar-caused sickness. She remains in a coterie because she knows that once her special relationship to the zars has been established, she is perpetually vulnerable to the ailments with which the spirits might want to afflict her and that her only reliable means for controlling this threat is to participate in the cult. The psychic and social advantages which a woman gains from participating in the cult are related to the special characteristics which are attributed to the zars. A devotee experiences the zars as transcendental forces which (1) are powerful enough to be held accountable for most events, particularly ones involving sickness, which threaten her well-being, (2) are interested in the events of her life, and (3) can be successfully manipulated in the actions which they take regarding her. Before a woman can realize these advantages, her special relationship with the zars must be made convincing to both herself and to the kith and kin among whom she lives. It is through episodes of zar possession and illnesses caused by zars that the relationship is made real and the claims to desiderata based on it become legitimate. These events, possession and sickness, are functionally equivalent in important ways (i.e., as proofs and as "cathartic" events), but the relative significance of each varies from devotee to devotee. It is useful to distinguish two typical career patterns for Amhara devotees around Gondar. In the first, possession and sickness play more or less equally important roles with respect to the adaptive strategies. This is the career of shamans, although it is by no means limited to them. What seems to make the shaman's career special is a prolonged period of intimate contact spent as an acolyte of an established shaman (see Zemmemu's narrative, for example). It is during this time that the shaman's detailed theological knowledge and technical skills (including pharmacological informa- tion necessary for curing) are absorbed, perhaps to be ultimately relearned when coopera- tive zars reveal, generally in dreams, this same information to the shaman-to-be. In the second career, possession is infrequeot and characterized by mild dissociation only, and episodes of zar-caused sickness tend to be the primary mechanisms by which the adaptive strategies are realized. Although the data I collected on this subject are incomplete, it is my impression that careers of the second type are most common among married women who are members of economically viable households, while the first type is more frequent among unmarried prostitutes, beer vendors, and servants living in towns. This distribution would be consistent with what we know about the extortive role of zar-caused sickness, of course. Cult members earn many of their advantages by successfully assigning responsi- bility for their extraordinary demands to the zars. But the relatives who must eventually pay up do not receive such demands passively. All Amhara know the economic con- sequences of zar afflictions, and it is always possible to contest a tentative zar diagnosis with another explanation which is equally plausible and even morally superior. In the end, a woman's capacity for using this adaptive strategy is predicated on her ability to out- flank rival diagnoses with relatively unambiguous indications, of which possession is the most persuasive and dreams are probably the more frequent. notes 11 would like to thank Charles Leslie for reading and commenting on this article. An earlier version was read at the 1972 meetings of the African Studies Association. The field research on which this article is based was conducted from January to December 1966 and during the summer of 1973 and was supported by a Public Health Service Research Grant and Fellowship from the National Institute of Mental Health and by a New York University Faculty Research Grant. 2One can speculate whether the Amhara's familiarity with religious brotherhoods (mahebar) in- fluenced the development of zar coteries in Begemder. Today, members of brotherhoods meet 582 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="17">periodically in one another's homes to feast and drink in honor of the saint for which the group has been organized. There is some nineteenth-century evidence of ecstatic brotherhoods (see Parkyns 1853:175-1 78). Within the zar coterie there are groups called akwadashs, each of which consists of devotees who are bound to the same zar and who perform a common sacrifice to this spirit (see Leiris 1938:121 ). 3There are two features of the zar cult which Leiris and Messing report and which I was unable to confirm, either because the features are not common to all coteries or they are no longer found in all coteries. (1 ) Shamans try to match devotees to zars so that a spirit does not make demands which his devotee is incapable of meeting (Leiris 1 938:11 7, 125; Messing 1958:1122). (2) Zars sometimes have an overtly sexual character. They appear as incubi, succubi (causing nocturnal emissions), and their "riding" during possession has a coitus-like character (Leiris 1933:80, 1934:337, 1934a:129-130, 1938:11 3, 119; Messing 1958:1124). 4According to Leiris (1 934a:453, 1938:11 6), devotees used the term as a euphemism for zars as well. SFrom a pharmacological point of view, the therapies of the herbalist, zar shaman, and debtera are identical. The only important exception is the decoction of chat and honey (awza), with which zar shamans treat cult initiands. 61 am writing here about the demon-calling debtera. Most of the cures of the minor debtera are comparable to those of herbalists. 7Although there is no single explanation with which most non-devotees are familiar, one popular explanation is that the zars are alien spirits that migrated to Ethiopia, probably from Muslim lands, some time in the past, or that they are the offspring of ganels and djinns. 8Amhara sometimes cite menstruation as the punishment which Eve was given for her role in The Fall. 9A similar point can be made about the magical instructions included in herbalist recipes. An herbalist's magic can achieve only two very limited goals. It can retain the natural powers of the materia medica, but only of the herbals mentioned in the recipe with which the magic was acquired. It can restore a homeostasis within the sick person's body, but only if it has been disrupted by a particular disease. Unlike the spirit healer's magic it can generate no new magic or information. references cited Dimotheos, R. P. 1871 Deux Ans de S6jour en Abyssinie.
