<plain_text><page sequence="1">Section Meetings AMERICAN DIALECT SOCIETY (South Atlantic Section) Chairman-Ernest H. Cox, Univer- sity of Florida. Secretary-James B. McMillan, Uni- versity of Alabama. Lois Lenski's Use of Regional Speech-George P. Wilson, Greens- boro, N. C. Lois Lenski, well-known writer and illustrator of children's books, has written several books portraying peo- ple, customs, and occupations in dif- ferent regions in America. In thesc books she uses the speech of the locale dealt with. To prepare herself, she lives in the homes of the persons she writes about. Her representation of their speech is accurate. She regards regional speech as an integral part of the presentation of her characters. Her regional books have been trans- lated into at least eight foreign lan- guages. * * * * Free Jack-Lucia Cameron Mor- gan, University of North Carolina. The discussion of the word free jack attempts to show a connection between the Jackson-Whites of thei Ramapo Mountains and the Free Jacks of Louisiana. Both are racial hybrids showing strains of White, Negro and Indian. The name Jackson has endured since the Revolutionary War when a trader brought 3,500 women to America for the entertainment of the British troops. The remnants of the Jackson-Whites still live in the Rama- po Mountains of New York. The colonization program of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1885 was offered as a possible clue for the im- migration of the Jackson-Whites to rural Louisiana communities whiei are adjacent to the Illinois Central Railroad. * * * * Names in South Cwrolina: A New Onomastic Periodical-Claude Henry Neuffer, University of South Caro- lina. A new method of recording names of a region is used in this six-year- old publication of the University uf t South Carolina English Department. i From its seven hundred subscribers 1 the editors encourage contributions t discussing legends and authentic ori- I gins of such varied subjects as names of churches, chapels of ease, planta- tions, swamps, and alleys. Typical articles have been "Charles- ton Alleys" by Drayton Mayrant, "Georgetown Plantations Names" by Alberta Lachicotte Quattlebaum, and "Saint Dominigan French Names" by Caroline Picault Aimar. * * * * Astronautics: The Story of a Search-Woodford A. Heflin, Re- search Studies Institute, Air Univer- sity. The word astronautique was firsL uttered by J. H. Rosny, aine, a French romance writer, on 26 De- cember, 1927. The occasion was a din- ner in Paris at the home of Andre Louis Hirsch. Persons present in- cluded Robert Esnault-Pelterie, noted pioneer aviator, Jean Baptiste Perrin, Nobel prize winner in physics, and other distinguished men. They had come together to plan a program for achieving the knowledge and equip- ment necessary for space travel. The English word "astronautics" is bor- rowed from the French. * * * * AMERICAN LITERATURE Chairman-Randall Stewart, Vander bilt University. Secretary-Walton R. Patrick, Au- burn University. SECTION I Nathaniel Ward and Cotton Ma- ther: A Comparison of Styles-Wi;- iiam R. Manierre, University of Vir- ginia. Alone among seventeenth-century New England works, Nathaniel Ward's Simple Cobler exceeds Cotton Mather's Magnalia in rhetorical flourishes. Yet, stylistically, few works are so easily distinguishable. Generalized criticism, however, has obscured the distinctions by empha- sizing the resemblances: baroque, fantastic, highly decorated, and rhet- orical qualities: Latin quotations learned allusions, verbal play, and general "swellings." My purpose is to indicate the basic differences. Ward's rapid movement, staccato rhythms, concision, earthy homeliness, concre- tion, specificity, and frequent obscur- ity are foreign to Mather's charac- teristic way of writing. These stylis- tic qualities constitute the essence o? 'Ward's prose-its diametrical opposi. tion, regardless of superficial resem- blances, to Mather's. * * * * Behind the Minister's Black Veil- John D. Allen, East Tennessee StaLe College. Nathaniel Hawthorne's tale of co- lonial New England has been various- ly interpreted by scholars and critics. Beginning with Poe, who confidently discovered in it the theme of adultery, apparently all have ignored or mini- mized the Calvinistic background of the story. Every feature of the narrative har- monizes with an initial impression that the veil concealing the face of Father Hooper probably was intended to stand for orthodox Calvinistic Pur itanism. An unobtrusive passage re- lates the fiction to history and sug- gests that the donning and wearing of the veil symbolizes the Great Awakening, to whose saintly leadei, Jonathan Edwards, the character of the minister bears resemblance. * * * * James's Names for His Puppets-- J. C. Childers, University of Florida. James's fascination with names, vividly shown in his notebooks, is also attested to by unusual sounding an' picturesque names bestowed upon the women in his "international" talei. James's names are charactonyms, that. is, they are descriptive or suggestiv. of the woman's dominant trait or quality, and serve to develop the plot and illuminate the theme. * * * * The Chinese Cantos of Ezra Pound -Max Halperen, North Carolina State College. There is no mystery about the gen- eral point of Cantos LII-LXI, the por- tion of Ezra Pound's long poem trac- ing the history of China, but there has not been adequate analysis of the major themes and organization of the individual Cantos of the group. A careful reading indicates that Pound has not only employed the chronologi- cal arrangement of his multivolume source but has carefully organized each Canto as a separate thematic unit, essentially as a separate poem, with its own direction and its own set of thematic juxtapositions. In dif- ferent Cantos, Pound identifies the Confucian spirit, defines the energies and knowledge required to maintain it, notes its relationship to economic SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN January, 1961 Page Eight</page><page sequence="2">January, 1961 SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN Page Nine theory, reveals it as part of a pat- tern of destruction and renewal, and, finally, brings it into conflict with the western religious tradition, seen, from the Chinese point of view, as weak and insignificant. * * * * Sinclair Lewis and Religion-Shel- don Norman Grebstein, University of Kentucky. Lewis's life-long hostility toward the clergy and religion probably be- gan as a reaction against his home- town environment. By the time he reached college this hostility was well developed, manifesting itself in sev- eral of the pieces Lewis wrote at Yale. Main Street, Babbitt, and Ar- rowhead contained evidence that Lewis's anticlericism remained un- changed, but it was not until Elmer Gantry that Lewis gave his views a full and explicit statement. While El- mer Gantry was typical of Lewis and demonstrated some of his greatest artistic strengths, on the whole it fails as both an expose of the cor- ruption of the clergy and as an at- tack on religion in America. The heat and anger which are largely respon- sible for the novel's weaknesses are more than flaws in Lewis's sensibil- ity, however. They stem from the temper of the time, a time which saw the bitter conflict between Fundamen- talism and Modernism. Lewis con- tinued to be a consistent foe of or- ganized religion for the rest of his life, as his later books prove. * * * * The Humor of Thomas Wolfe- Paschal Reeves, Florida Southern College. Although Wolfe is generally con- sidered a gloomy writer, his work frequently flashes with humor. His whole approach to his writing is in the oral rather than the literary tra- dition, and this is especially true of his humor. Satire constitutes, quan- titatively, the greater part of his total humor, but he has a natural tendency for parody and caricature. Wolfe, like Faulkner, owes a large debt to old Southwest humor, espe- cially the tall tale. Wolfe is most suc- cessful in his humor when he remem- bers, in the words of Dryden, that "wit is best conveyed to us in the most easy language." * * * * SECTION II Two Groups of Poets-Louis D. Rubin, Jr., Hollins College. In the early 1920's two poetry groups led the revival of poetry in the Southern states: the Nashville Fugitives and the Poetry Society of South Carolina. At first glance the two seem similar in aims and atti- tudes. Closer inspection, however, re- veals sharp differences that help to account for the fact that the poets of the South Carolina society are no longer remembered as poets, whi'e those of the Nashville group-Tate, Ransom, Davidson, Warren-are among the most important names in twentieth-century American poetry. These differences include the fact that the Fugitives were a tightly- knit working group, while the Poetry Society was a public organization with community functions; that the Poetry Society poets tried conscious- ly to use Southern materials in theAr work, while the Nashville group shunned any trace of local color- this despite the fact that both groups were essentially "Southern" in their attitude toward language and society; and finally, that the Fugitives were vitally concerned with language, oriented toward criticism, and were "intellectual" poets, while the South Carolina group was incurious toward language. The South Carolina group's members turned toward popular fic- tion, while the better Fugitives made poetry their life work. American Little Magazines in the Fifties-Warren G. French, Univer- sity of Florida. Gloomy pronouncements that the "little magazine" is being supplanted by the academic quarterly are un- warranted, since there were during the fifties actually more privately- supported, experimental literary jour- nals than ever before. The contents of most of these magazines was, how- ever, notable neither for quality nor novelty. The most promising little magazines of the decade-eclectic journals like New World Writing, produced as parts of paperbound se- ries-have already disappeared. Hope for significant avant garde writing has been rekindled, however, by the emergence of the San Francisco "Beat" writers. While the "Beat.s" are naive and undisciplined, their en- thusiasm has proved contagious and has led to the establishment of lively journals like Contact, Coastlines, and The Fifties. * * * * The Present State of Prose Fiction In the South: A Panel Discussion- Walter Sullivan, Vanderbilt Univer- sity (moderator); Madison P. Jones, Jr., Auburn University; Andrew Lytle, University of Florida; Robert W. Daniel, Kenyon College. * * * * COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Chairman-George M. Harper, Uni- versity of North Carolina. Secretary-Maxwell A. Smith, Uni- versity of Chattanooga. Ezra Pound's Verse Translations- Gary G. Scrimgeour, University of Florida. Verse translation has played a ma- jor part in Ezra Pound's career as both literary theorist and poet. As a theorist of translation he advancea ideas which have since become gen- erally accepted. His work with foreigut languages, especially Chinese, gave him most of his theories of language, anticipating Eliot and Richards. Most of the translations are no longer ot major value, but Cathay and The Classic Anthology have great merit. * * * A South American Translation of Paradise Lost-A. C. Howell, Univer- sity of North Carolina. The paper discusses the introduc- tion to and the prose translation of Paradise Lost (Ghent, 1868), by Ani- bal Galindo, Colombian statesman and author. Besides appreciation of the poem, the introduction contains criticism of previous Spanish trans- lations, discussion of problems met in translating English into Spanish, and illustrated comments of the transla- tor's own methods. Competent and ac- curate, the translation shows no at- tempt to adapt Milton to Catholic readers. Following Galindo's plea, the Revista del Rio de la Plata reprinted the introduction and specimen pas- sages, urging readers to study Milton as a powerful voice in the figh' against tyranny. * * * * The Man Who Thought Himself Made of Glass, and Certain Related Images-Alfred G. Engstrom, Uni- versity of North Carolina. The paper cites a number of char- acteristic occurrences of the motif, considers certain psychological impii- cations, and suggests the relation of elements in the motif to a wider range of poetry and to a drama of our time (The Glass Menagerie of Tennessee Williams). The image of glass, in its frangibility, is seen to have a kind of archetypal significance, and its sym- January, 1961 SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN Page Nine</page><page sequence="3">Page Ten SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN January, 1961 bolic meaning is found to afford a vivid example of the power of meta- phor as a means of exploring psychic reality. * * * * Oedipus and Les Gommes-Walter A. Strauss, Emory University. Robbe-Grillet is committed to an idea of the novel that dispenses with symbols and that defies interpreta- tion; he has attempted to write novels that are as objective as an optical image. Why then does he superim- pose the Oedipus theme upon his first novel, Les Gommes? This novel is a detective story in a modern setting, in which the Oedipus theme is reen- acted, i.e., in which the investigator turns out to be the criminal. But more significantly, the Oedipus theme en- ables Robbe-Grillet to make an in- direct statement about the inexorable workings of time. Les Gommes, with the help of the Oedipus theme, pre- sents the circularity of time, without explaining it. Battles in the Iliad, The Knight's Tale, and A Midsummer Night's Dream-T. Walter Herbert, Univer- sity of Florida. If when we witness the fairy-con- trolled efforts of Lysander and Deme- trius to fight over Helena we must accept Shakespeare's invitation to have in the back of our minds the frustrated single combat between Paris and Menelaos and the teleo- logically futile tournament over Eme- lye, the absurdity of the comic duel is enhanced in two ways: by the con- trast between mighty and petty and the contrast between believer and ag- nostic when the believer is right. A Tale of Two Ashcans: Reflections on the Drama-Kermit Hunter, Hol- lins College. The modern drama suffers from poets, sociologists, psychologists, and other propagandists who endeavor to deliver their messages in play form. Instead of misusing the theatre, we should look for and seek to develop theatre men who are thinkers. Ameri- ca is the one country which provide5 the opportunity. * * * * ENGLISH I Chairman-Harriet R. Holman, Er- skine College. Secretary-Simeon K. Heninger, Jr., Duke University. (The three papers whose abstracts follow will be published in full in the next number of TENNESSEE STUDIES IN LITERATURE.) The Effect of the Restoration on Prose Fiction-Benjamin Boyce, Duke University. In English prose fiction one can see no immediate effect of the Res- toration, partly because the reading of the 1660's seems to have been so much like that of the 1650:s. But it is probable that Restoration court society prolonged the vogue of the heroic French romances even as iv also later encouraged the production of the short, somewhat realistic novel of passionate adventure and the ro- man d clef. * * * * The Effect of the Restoration on Drama-Cyrus Hoy, Vanderbilt Uni- versity. Restoration drama represents the final working out of tendencies pres- ent in English drama for at least a half century prior to 1660. Restora- tion comedy of manners is the refine- ment of Elizabethan satiric comedy. Restoration tragedy represents the culmination of the movement away from tragedy that sets in in English drama after Shakespeare. Its sub- ject is erotic passion, and its form is tr'gicomic more often than tragic. * * * * The Effect of the Restoration on Poetry-J. E. Congleton, Findlay College. Whether the re-establishment of a stable order by the Restoration of Charles II was one of actual fact or only of official fiction, its effect on poetry, combined with a new wave of influence from Latin and French poetry and from the rising empiric- ism resulted in the "poetry of state- ment"-poetry characterized by ob- servation of contemporary issues yet noted for the strength and elegance of its closed couplets. Such poetry, anticipated by Waller and Denham, is most fully exemplified in Dryden's great satires. * * * * ENGLISH II Chairman-J. A. Bryant, Jr., Duke University. Secretary-Edgar H. Duncan, Van- derbilt University. "Fire on Flood"--Christian or Teu- tonic ?-Rhea Thomas Workman, Co- lumbia College. There has been general agreement with Klaeber that the description of Grendel's mere in Beowulf (1357b- 1376a) "manifestly" contains con- cepts from the Christian afterworld tradition, especially the "fyr on flode," which Klaeber says was drawn from the burning river in the Visi Pauli. However, not only does this passage lack the Christian concep; of elements of scenery as inherentiy elements of inescapable torture, but the Teutonic tradition offers an abun- dance of material compatible witi. the descriptive elements of this pas sage, both in objective detail and in possible mythic significance. * * * * The Gift-Theme in the Towneley Plays-John Algeo, Florida State University. In the Towneley Plays severa. kinds of "gifts" can be distinguished: sacrifice offered to the godhead, tithes paid to the church, birth-gifts brought to the Christ child, and those gifts which God bestows upon man. This gift-giving serves two didactic pur- poses in the plays; it reminds the auditors of their financial and moral obligations, and it symbolizes some of the doctrines of the church. The in- dividual gifts may be thought of as variations on a theme: man's obliga- tion to render back what he has re- ceived from God, the giver of all good gifts. * * * * Act Five: Honest Hamlet-Gale H. Carrithers, Jr., Duke University. Many critics agree that Hamlet meets his death honorably, but a num- ber do disagree sharply. I maintain that examination of his last speeches discloses a rhetoric of contingency, the mark of his new, and relative, humility. His uses of the subjunctive and his ambiguities take account of the possible locations of truth and enable him to make a commitment to truth without judging presumptuous- ly. * * * * Comic Truth in Shakespeare and Jonson-Peter G. Phialas, University of North Carolina. The chief concern of Jonsonian comedy is to satirize vice and folly in the world of immediate experience. Different from the romantic comedy of his contemporaries, Jonson's plays follow a pattern outlined by himself in the Induction to The Mag- netic Lady. The plan is to create a "center attractive" of a circle, whose perimeter is a diversity of characters representing a variety of humours. Page Ten SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN January, 1961</page><page sequence="4">January, 1961 SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN Page Eleven Jonson leads these characters to the magnetic center, whose attraction ex- poses their follies and vices. The ac- tion moves in the direction of greater and greater socio-moral disintegra- tion: from a normal world towards a subnormal one. Believing that roman- tic love is inconsistent with truth, Jonson rejected it as a theme for ex- tensive comic treatment. And when- ever he introduces it in his comedies he consistently satirizes it On the other hand, Shakespeare's development as a comic dramatist can be seen in his growing ability to ad- just romantic love to a comic action. This action takes his characters from a normal world to an idealized one, Lo the Forest of Arden, Belmont, or an enchanted island. Their sojourn in this idealized world witnesses changes, union of lovers, reconcilia- tion of enemies, regeneration. And after these changes the characters return to their earlier world. Shake- speare's lovers may be united in aro idealized scene but they achieve and must enjoy their happiness in the ma- terial world we know. The idealized goals of romance are not fully achieved; they are merely approxi- mated. These differences in the nature and direction of the action in the comedies of Shakespeare and Jonson indicate a difference in the ultimate meaning of their plays. Jonson's comic truth is expressed in a brilliant elaboration, in infinite and accurate detail, of the flaws responsible for human failure. Shakespeare's is revealed in the jux- taposition of man's longing for an idealized existence, for perfection, with the awareness of his limitations. Jonson's comic vision looks away from Eden toward a human Hell by pre- senting action which illustrates the Fall; Shakespeare's looks beyond the Fall by presenting action which de- fines a human Eden. * * * * Henry Vaughan's Multiple Time Scheme-Fredson Bowers, University of Virginia. For Henry Vaughan time stretched in an endless allegorical vista back from seventeenth-century England to Adam and Eve in Paradise. Eacn time-episode allegorically included several larger units. Thus the life of a man from childhood to death was typified by any day in his life from dawn to dusk. Moreover, the life of Old Testament days to the Day of Judgment. The unifying allegorical device for Vaughan's simultaneously superim- posed time sequences was man's pil- grimage from the daylight of heaven through the daikness of this world and back to the light again in his native home. Everyman follows the track beaten out by the feet of ail mankind. Vaughan called mornings "the first worlds Youth" by analogy with the dawn of the first day during the Creation when the sun was placed in the heavens. The childhood of man followed on the creation, and in Eden and its sunshine days man had his youth. But the Fall drew the clouds across the heavens, and through Old Testament days man travelled through the darkness to recover his lost Paradise, which was not ex- tended to him until the birth of Christ, the Son and Sun. But not until the Day of Judgment will man's long pilgrimage on earth end and he be permanently an in- habitant of eternity instead of tem- porality. * * * * Dryden and the Imagination: Some "Controversial" Essays-John M. Aden, Vanderbilt University. The Defence of the Epilogue, Pre- face and Postscript to Notes and Ob- servations on the. Empress of Moroc- co, and The Author's Apology are not reactionary with respect to imagina- tion, though they have left that im- pression from their polemical nature. Actually they exhibit no significant departure from Dryden's earlier lib- eral views. The Defence belongs to the Battle of the Books, the Preface and Postscript reject bombast not imagination, and the Apology re- formulates the definition in the Pre- face to Annus Mirabilis. * * * * ENGLISH III Chairman-Hill Shine, University of Kentucky. Secretary-John C. Stephens, Jr., Emory University. Aaron Hill's Insolvent: An Adap- tation of an Adaptation-Fielding Russell, Georgia Southern College. Aaron Hill, one of the eighteenth- century "improvers" of the plays of their more distinguished predecessors, died without knowing that The In- solvent; or Filial Piety (1758), his Adultress, was an adaptation of an adaptation of Massinger's The Fatal Dowry. An examination of contempor- ary sources, notably Hill's corre- spondence with Theophilus Cibber, for whom he wrote his adaptation, and Gildon's The New Rehearsal (1714), and The Postman Robb'd of His Mail (1719), and a comparison of The Insolvent with The Fatal. Dowry, which Hill did not know, es- tablish this adaptive relationship. Did Hume Improve the Treatise- Redding S. Sugg, Jr., Georgia State College. Following the disappointing recep- tion of his A Treatise of Human Na- ture, David Hume recast its materials and requested that the results (An Enquiry concerning Human Under- standing and An Enquiry concerning the Principals of Morals, chiefly) be preferred. Although his request has been generally ignored, the present essay shows that his extensive self- editing resulted in stylistically im- proved work and must also have pro- duced better philosophy unless we are prepared to say his insights stopped short at the mechanical level. Scott and The Edinburgh Annual Register-Kenneth Curry, University of Tennessee. The Edinburgh Annual Register (1808-1826) reflected for its first nine years the literary and antiquarian in- terests of Scott, and drew from his circle its chief contributors. A finan- cial failure, the Register had its share in the bankruptcy of the Bal- lantyne and Constable firms. Southey, Hogg, Wilson, Leyden, and Lockhart niade important contributions to the historical and literary departments. After Scott, Hugh Murray, the geog- rapher, assumed responsibility for the Register. * * * * Significant Points of Comparison between The Biblical Criticism of Thomas and Matthew Arnold-Eu- gene L. Williamson, Jr., University of Alabama. Six aspects of Matthew Arnold's religious criticism mark it as the full development of principles already set forth in the works of Dr. Arnold: (1) rejection of the idea of plenary inspiration; (2) emphasis on the eth- ical, rather than the metaphysical, significance of the Bible; (3) vali- alteration of an anonymous (and now lost) manuscript play, The Guiltless SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN Page Eleven January, 1961 dation of religious doctrines by the teachings of Christ; (4) reference to a man could also be typified by the history of mankind from the earliest</page><page sequence="5">Page~~~~~ Twelve SOUT ATANI BULTNJnur,16 experience (the "experimental test") as demonstration of the efficacy of Christian teachings; (5) distrust of anthropomorphic conceptions of God's nature; and (6) considered employ- ment of humanistic learning in Bibli- cal interpretation. * * * * A Contemporary Revival of the Ro- mantic Concept of Nature-Harry R. Sullivan, North Georgia College. A contemporary writer, John Cow- per Powys, has revived much of the essence of the early Wordsworth's elemental, animistic, even fetishistic feelings about nature. Mr. Powys has developed for moderns a cult of the sensations in his attempt to return to a world destroyed by the cults of both supernaturalism and material- ism: namely, a world of chaoticism, pluralism, polytheism, animism, fec- ishism, and even something uncom- monly like magic. * * * * FOLKLORE Chairman-George Boswell, More- head State College. Secretary-W. C. Childers, Florida State University. Nineteenth-Century Outlaws in Alabama Folklore-Margaret Gillis Figh, Huntingdon College. The Murrell gang, Jesse James, Burrow, and Railroad Bill were the outstanding outlaw heroes in Ala- bama folk tales of the nineteenth century. Traditional patterns are fol- lowed in stories about these bandits. They received aid from supernatural powers, they escaped from their cap- tors by means of their own superior wits, they rendered unexpected kind- nesses to those who befriended them, and they often iobbed railroads and banks, two institutions distrusted by the people of that day. * * * * Animal Lore in Lawson's (1709) and Brickell's (1737) Natural His- tories of North Carolina-Arthur Palmer Hudson, University of North Carolina. Early American folklore "resulted from the grafting of Old World be- liefs onto the New World environ- ment, and the generation of folk fan- cies within old forms." This process is exemplified by the two classics of colonial writing about the Carolinas in the authors' accounts of the ap- pearance, habits, behavior, and ex- ploits of the wild animals-possums, raccoons, bears, panthers, wolves, "tigers," minks, alligators, various kinds of snakes, terrapins, birds, fish, whales, etc.-seen by Lawson and al legedly seen by Dr. Brickell. In these accounts, and especially in the anec- dotes about the animals, are to be seen the prototypes of many common present-day beliefs and fantasies, and the outlines of several types o.* American humor. (This paper has been published in full, with photo- graphs of title pages and copperplate illustrations, in North Carolina Folk- lore (December 1960) and is sched- uled for publication in The Missis- sippi Quarterly.) * * * * Re-Eliciting Songs and Ballads from Living Informants of Early Collectors in the South-Philip H. Kennedy, Indiana University. As this project got under way it pertained to finding people fron whom Cecil Sharp and Frank C. Brown, notable among early collec- tors in the South, had previously col- lected. Primarily, it is a study of traditionality, involving as it does the elements of change and constancy in the memories of the still-living sing- ers included as informants. Resultant field work and research are currently being written up in thesis form at Indiana University. * * * * Possible Survivals of a Matriarchal Tradition in the Literature of the West-Jack A. Reynolds, University of Miami. Western literature, from classical through Germanic and Celtic to Eng- lish, shows strong internal evidence of early matriarchal customs and tra- ditions. Vestiges in some literary sur- vivals indicate that matriarchal in- heritance and a subsequent transitioi period lasted loriger in many areas of Western culture than is realized generally. Certain plot devices and motivations may be accounted for logically by the assumption of inheri- tance from mother to daughter and by managerial authority devolving on the mother's brother. * * * * FRENCH I Chairman-Warren Gates, Pfeiffer College. Secretary-Albert Leduc, Florida State University. French Books in the Libraries of Colonial Virginia-Joseph Medard Carriere, University of Virginia. This study is based upon an exam- ination of the inventories of six li- braries, three of the seventeenth cen- tury, and three of the eighteenth. The term "French books" as used in this paper refers not only to French works in the original or in English translation but also to French lan- guage study aids such as dictionaries and grammars. Considering the small population of the colony, its limited educational facilities, and its remote- ness from the European scene, Vir- ginians showed remarkable interest in French books. * * * * Etienne Dolet's Defense and Punc- tuation of the French Language- Rosalyn Gardner, Gallaudet College. The French language owes a great deal to Etienne Dolet. As scholar and printer, he was one of the humanists who contributed most to the renas- cence of letters under Francis I. His Maniere de bien traduire d'une langue en autre; d'awantage de la punctua- tion de la langue francaise; plus de:' accents d'ycelle (1540) won great praise for him in his time and was considered definitive by his con- temporaries. Dolet was one of the earliest defenders of his native tongue and foreshadowed Malherbe in hls desire to reduce the language to per- fection, basing vocabulary upon usage. In punctuation, his little trea- tise is a landmark in the develop- ment of clarity in the written lan- guage; he was the first to set down our modern marks with rules formu- lated for their use. * * * * The Meliorism of Candide in the light of Voltaire's Life-Louis A. Triebel, Converse College and the University of Tasmania. Bayle had posed the problem of evil which is the subject of Voltaire's Candide. For Bayle, God was either good and not omnipotent, or He was omnipotent and not good. The philos- opher Leibnitz objected: the universe is one long chain of being, from (Goc to the infinitesimal, with man as a link in this chain. In this harmony, partial evil is universal good, a view popularized by Pope- And in spite of pride, in erring Reason's spite, One truth is clear, whatever is, is right. Voltaire commented, "Un jour tout sera bien, voila notre esperance. Aujourd'hui tout est bien, voila l'il- Page Twelve SOUTH ATLANTIC BUJLLETIN January, 1961</page><page sequence="6">January, 1961 SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN Page Thirteen lusion." This illusion he illustrated in the ironic tale of Candide. By considering Voltaire's long ex- perience of the philosophical opti- mist's perfect world, we see how he came to recognize evil and suffering. Yet he clung to the ideas of prog- ress and perfectibility of man. Su- perstition, inhumanity, and intoler- ance were his life-long enemies. In a career scarcely less checkered than that of Candide he never ceased to labor for the common good, believing that we must cultivate our garden without quixotic enthusiasm. Candide has richness of meaning and universal import. The treatment is often ironical as false ideas are reduced to the absurd; a pricking of the balloon of a pompous, empty op- timism, nowhere corresponding with reality. Reason is shown to be man's distinctive instrument for setting things in their true perspective and seeking a balance between the real and the possible so that we may learn the road to a happy creative life. * * * * M. Jaugeon's Art de l'Imprimerie, Philippe-Denis Pierres, Franklin, and Jefferson-George B. Watts, David- son College. The Royal Academy of Sciences desired as its first number in its projected Descriptions des Arts et Metiers a treatise on "that art which was to preserve all others, the art of writing and printing." In 1699 M. Jaugeon began the composition of such a work. To illustrate it, the dis- tinguished engraver Simmoneau pre- pared a set of engravings. When the Academy finally began publishing the Descriptions in 1761, Jaugeon's long, carefully-wrought manuscript and the accompanying illustrations were not used. In August, 1773, the well known printer and publisher, Philippe-Denis Pierres, "imprimeur ordinaire da roi," was charged by the Academy to write a new description of the art of printing. He planned to prepare a work of three folio volumes and drev up his proposal for it. He never com- pleted the task. The John M. Wing Foundation of the Newberry Library, Chicago, has acquired many frag- ments, manuscripts and microfihmn, among them the unpublished "Auto- biography" of Pierres, who was named "premier imprimeur du roi'r in 1785, and who, ruined by the Rev olution, after seeking unsuccessfully the position of director of the Gov- ernment Printing Office under Na- poleon, accepted a minor post in D,- jon, where he died in 1808. Franklin honored him "with his friendship," * and engaged him to print the Con- stitutions des treize etats d'Amerique, and other documents. He also printecl certain materials for Thomas Jeffer- son, for his private use and "for the * United States." * * * * FRENCH 11 Chairman-Howard Sutton, Vander- bilt University. Secretary-George Ross Ridge, Geor- gia State College. Stendhal et les romans de Voltaire -Jules C. Alciatore, University of Georgia. Stendhal began reading Voltaire's novels at fifteen and he frequently reread them. He disliked Voltaire's character and condemned his malig- nity and mechancete, as reflected in his fiction. On the other hand, he ad- mired his wit and style. Ideas and in. cidents in Stendhal's writings and Voltaire's novels are often strikingiy similar, and Voltaire's clear, concise, and lively style probably helped so fashion Stendhal's, in spite of the latter's aversion to Voltaire's vul- garity and triviality. * * * * Neither Black nor White: An In- terpretation of Merimee's "Tamango" -James S. Patty, Washington and Lee University. By an analysis of the plot and o0 certain symbols, M6rimee's "?liaman- go" (1829) is interpreted to be, not an anti-slavery pamphlet, but a nar- rative centered on the tragic figure of Tamango himself. Attempting to be neither black nor white, that is, to occupy and exploit a position in the no-man's land between two conflict- ing sets of values, Tamango goes down to destruction. But M6rimee gives us, not a psychological study of Tamango's failure, but an allegory on opportunism. * * * * Proust's Conception of Character -Henry Miller, Jr., College ot Charleston. Proust delighted in a surprise re- versal of character, as we see in Ei- stir, Vinteuil, and many others. The two most common explanations have been that he was influenced by Berg- son and the Impressionists. It seems rather that he was using one of the most intimate aspects of his own life, and was saying in essence that gooc aund bad in a person are not irrecon- cilable, but may be fused to produce growth and creativity. * * * * Le Surr6alisme litteraire et ses critiques-Jacques Hardr6, Unive'- sity of North Carolina. Since the publication of Breton's First Manifesto, in 1924, many criti- cal works have appeared dealing with Surrealism. At first, the critics tended to dismiss it as a youthful ex- plosion of revolt against society. Then, just prior to the Second World War, they discovered in it much tha' was worthy of study, particularly in relation to modern psychology and social doctrines. Since the War, Sur- realism has been presented as an esoteric and mystical philosophy: an interesting counterpart to the exis tential philosophy of the Absurd. * * * * Giono's Cycle of the Hussard Novels-Maxwell A. Smith, Univer- sity of Chattanooga. From time to time during the pro- duction of his post-war chronicles, Giono has returned with filial piety to the series of novels whose chic: protagonists exemplify members of his own family-his father, his mother, and his grandfather, the Italian carbonaro. When Pauline, thi last of the six volumes in the Hus- sard cycle, is completed in 1961 ,r 1962, Giono will publish them all in a one-volume edition aocording to the chronology of their action, and this arrangement is therefore fol- iowed in this paper: L'Ecossmis, An- gelo, Le Hussard sur le toit, Le Bon- heur fou, Pauline, and Mort d'un personnage. Of these Le Hussard is the most generally acclaimed, Le Bon- heur fou the most disconcerting and original, and Mort d'un personnage the most movingly personal. * * * * FRESHMAN ENGLISH Chairman-George Walker, West Georgia College. Secretary-Bain T. Stewart, Univer- sity of Tennessee. SECTION I ETV: An Aid, Not a Replacement -Kellogg W. Hunt, Florida State University. At Florida State University, edu- cational television is used as an aid not a replacement, for the common type of instruction given by a regular instructor to a regular section of January, 1961 SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN Page Thirteen</page><page sequence="7">Page Fourteen SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN January, 1961 freshman English students. Television intrudes only by bringing one most carefully prepared lecture into the regular classroom one of the three periods each week. The advantage oi that lecture, in addition to its scrupu- lous preparation, is its rich use of audio-visual aids. * * * * Freshman Composition by Educa- tional TV Channel-Robert W. Hive- ly, University of Miami. * * * * SECTION II Freshmen and the Library Paper. An Experiment-J. 0. Bailey, Uni- versity of North Carolina. To meet swelling enrollments, the University of North Carolina con- ducted an experiment in teaching second-semester freshman English composition in classes of a hundred students taught by a professor and four readers, who also held confer- ences with each student. The sub- stance was "controlled research" (for nine ordinary themes) and a library paper (2500 words). For the superior students, the large class and the i- brary paper stimulated good work, for below-average students, both Lhe large class and the long paper were less effective than small-class drill. * * * * Some Problems Encountered in a Large Section of Freshman Compo- sition-Charles E. Edge, University of North Carolina. In an oversized class in English composition, a teacher can expect to encounter mechanical difficulties and a peculiar kind of disciplinary prob lem. Other problems, he will find, are more difficult to solve. How, for example, can he conduct a discussion in a class four times the usual size? And how can he maintain the bal- ance which must exist between him- self, his assistants, and his students if the class is to succeed? * * * * The Present Status of the Research Paper in Freshman English: A Na- tional Survey-Ambrose N. Manning, East Tennessee State College. A national survey of 250 collegeo and universities (of which 68.4% re- plied) reveals that 83% of them re- quire a research paper for freshmen. An overwhelming majority, 82.4%, teach the techniques of research after the freshman's first term. Most of the schools require the traditional long research paper, but 33.5% now are using "controlled research" pamphlets. Eighty-five per cent of ; tnc schools report satisfactory re- ; suits. Although the minority which has discontinued the freshman research paper is vociferous, it is clear that the status of the research paper in Freshman English remains high. * * * * Linguistics in Freshman English-- Jane Appleby, University of Georgia. Many linguists reject the old gram- matical terms originally intended co describe Greek and Latin, and pur- port to teach effective speech and writing by describing what is being said-not what should be said-witn emphasis upon sound (pitch, stress, tone). The linguistic approach leaves the student with no vocabulary with which to talk about language and no standards at which to aim; however, it offers the teacher newness, fresh- ness, color, and suggestions for class- room experiments. * * * * Preparation in English of Gradu- ates of Alabama White Senior High Schools Enrolled as Freshmen in Nine Alabama Colleges and Universities (1954-1959)-Franklin T. McCann, Auburn University. This study, made under the aus- pices of the Association of Collegs English Teachers of Alabama, shows the following results: (1) that th:, percentage of remedial students de- creased from 24% in 1954 to 16% in 1959; (2) that the percentage of superior students remained constant at 5% for the same period. These results suggest two conclu- sions for high school English teachers in Alabama: (1) that the poor stu- dent at the high school level needs continued attention, since the percen- tage of remedial students at the col- lege level is still too high; (2) that the bright student at the high school level needs more attention, since there has been no increase in the percen- tage of superior students at the col- lege level for this six-year period. * * * * GERMAN Chairman-John L. Hodges, Stetson University. Cecretary-H. Woodrow Fuller, Uni- versity of Tennessee. SECTION I Rilke and the Gibsons-George C. Schoolfield, Duke University. The events of the first half of Rainer Maria Rilke's stay in Sweden, at BorgebygArd (SkAne) from June until September, 1904, are relatively well known; those of the second half, spent as a guest of the Gibson family at Jonsered near Gothenburg from September until early December, are not. With the aid of Rilke's and Gib- son's correspondence from this time, it has been possible to reconstruct an unusual episode in Rilke's life, a brief period in which he behaved- and perhaps even regarded himself- as a teacher and reformer. * * * * Scientific German Today-Nelson Van deLuyster, The Citadel. In a world science-minded and dom- inated, the need for a reading knowl- edge of scientific German is at an all-time high, with non-technological colleges introducing beginning courses in the field and high schools using intermediate science texts. Much is being done for the student in the in- termediate field. The teacher of scien- tific German today must be better prepared and better read than a gen- eration ago. The student has muc.i to gain from courses in scientific German. * * * * Hauptmann's Frau Wolff and Brecht's Mutter Courage-Herbert W. Reichert, University of North Caro- lina. Despite many similarities, the pro- tagonists are intrinsically different. Frau Wolff reflects Hauptmann's be- lief that man was unfree and that the world had to proceed on its tragic course. Mutter Courage brings inwu sharp focus Brecht's communist con- viction that men should be led tL believe that it lies within their powe. to make a choice between the deca- dent bourgeois society that spawn,. war and the brave new sociali?' world. * * * * Jorg Wickram and Word Order- Albert L. Lancaster, Virginia Mili- tary Institute. In his first nov?el, Galmy, Jbrg Wickram formed his style carefull, upon an esteemed Renaissance work, Arigo's translation of Boccaccio's De- cameron, and followed Arigo in plac- ing the finite verb last in main clauses. As he progressed in his crafL, Wickram came to see through his wide reading that Arigo's practice was not normal, and in his later novels gradually sloughed off this striking syntactical peculiarity and approached a nearly normal Germani word order. SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN January, 1956 Page Fourteen</page><page sequence="8">January, 1961 SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN Page Fifteen Grim to My Foes and Kind to My Friends-George F. Jones, Goucher College. When medieval writers advised be- ing "grim to your foes and kind to your friends," they were following a literary tradition popular since Euripides. This thought was some- times expressed as "haughty to the strong and gentle to the weak," and sometimes the two variants were mixed. Although the policy of being grim to one's enemies was contrary to Christian humility and forgiveness, it was taught by many clerical writ- ers and often appeared as a maxim in pedagogical works aimed at young rulers. SECTION II An Informal Evening with Fried- rich Diirrenmatt-Francis J. Brooke III, University of Virginia. In a cordial and lively five-hour in- terview-in his home in Neuchatel on} August 6, 1960, Friedrich Duirren- matt displayed a variety of interests. He voiced personal reservations about the English language version of his play, Der Besuch der alten Dame, and commented on his works, practices, and literary preferences. He also dis- cussed world politics in detail, men- tioned his reactions to a visit to America, and scored the indiscrimi- nate pursuit of culture by Europeans. * * * * Tragedy and Law in the Njals saga -Robert L. Kellogg, University of Virginia. The heroes of the Njals saga were bound by two conflicting codes of con- duct. The traditional heroic code ol honor demanded swift and terrible revenge for the death of a kinsman, while the civil law of the Common- wealth demanded patient observance of a highly complex judicial proce- dure. Insults traded between their wives resulted in crimes and counter- crimes that eventually engulfed not only Gunnar and Njall themselves but the entire nation before the bal- ance of justice was restored. Their heroic idealism and a failure of the legal process exposed the heroes to the inevitable destruction that awaits those who impede the working of so- cial justice. * * * * Der Bergriff des B6sen bei Jakob Boehme-Herbert Deinert, University of Georgia. * * * * The Study of German in the Public Secondary Schools of the Samla Arca (1948-1958)-Melanie R. Rosbo:- ough, University of Miami. In 1948 German was taught in the public high schools of only two states in the Samla area. In 1958 German was taught in six states, only Ala- bama and Tennessee having no classes. Since then Alabama has added German in five public high schools. Kentucky has the largest German enrollment both in numbers and i1l percentage. Florida is second in en- rollment. German, however, amounts to only .041 of the total foreign lan- guage enrollment in Kentucky and goes down to .001 in North Carolina. It lags far behind Latin, Spanish, and French in the Samla area but is considerably ahead of Russian which in 1958 was taught in only two Samla states. * * * * PORTUGUESE-BRAZILIAN Chairman-John E. Keller, Univer- sity of North Carolina. Secretary-Doris H. Francis, Gallau- det College. Courtly Love in Two Plays of Gil Vicente-Thomas R. Hart, Jr., Emory University. Both D. Duardos and the Comedia do Viuvo are deeply indebted to the traditional presentation of courtly love, familiar to Gil Vicente and to his readers from the cancioneros and the romances of chivalry. In both, however, the traditional materials are very freely reshaped to meet the de- mands set by the action of the par- ticular play. In the Comedia do Viuvo, Vicente juxtaposes the court- ly convention with two portraits of marriage, in his presentation of the widower and of the compadre, and in doing so makes us aware of the limitations of the convention itself, the things it neglects to mention. In D. Duwrdos, he gives new life to the time-worn conventions of courtly love, precisely by insisting that they are usually conventions and then going on to show that, in this special case, we are not concerned with conven- tions at all, but with deeply felt emo- tions. Here, with the protagonist's insistence that Florida return his love, Vicente is, I think, much closer to our'modern conception of romantic love than to the courtly tradition. * * * * Fray Luis de Granada and Portu- gal-John A. Moore, College of Wil- liam and Mary. Fray Luis spent his last thirty-five years in Portugal. Before 1580 the years were tranquil politically and fruitful in religious writings and service. Most of his writings were in Castilian, but one-on Christian doc- trine-vwas in Portuguese. Fray Luis was unwittingly in. volved in the intrigue over the Por-. tuguese succession but managed to avoid the enmity of the Portuguese people and the suspicion of the Span- ish king at a time of bitterness for the Portuguese nation. * * * * The Recent Novels of Fernando Namora-Michael S. Pincus, Univer- sity of North Carolina. The present paper is an attempt to show the development of the style of Fernando Namora as seen through his two latest novels, 0 trigo e o joio, 1954, and 0 homen. disfarqado, 1958. Also discussed briefly were his early autobiographical account of stuaent life, As sete partidas do mundo (1938), and a recent collection of short stories, Cidade solitdria (1959). In 0 trigo e o joio, Namora por- trays the life of peasants in the Alen- tejo, and their dreams and frustra- tions. Through the alternation of rambling and short sentences, Na- mora effectively creates an atmos- phere of the tedious life of the pea- sants and their brief spells of ex- citement. The basic conflict of the novel is excellently handled but there is excessive exposition before this conflict is reached. Namora combines elements of Proust and Joyce in 0 homen dis- farfado. He achieves a certain degree of success, but is hindered by his dif- ficulties in handling the flash-back technique. The reader, however, is left with a strong sense of movement, and a sense of having actually ob- served the psychological reactions of the central character of the novel. Fernando Namora is seen as an outstanding novelist of today, a con- tinuer of the main stream of Portu- guese literature, but with a depar- ture into the realm of psychologicali analysis. * * * * SLAVIC Chairman-Max Oppenheimer, Jr.- Florida State University.

Friedl, Uni versity of Miami. An upward trend continues. Eigh teen replies to 28 questionnaires show some spectacular gains as well as gradual increase at all levels. Of spe- cial interest was the report from a new institution-the Inter-Americai University of Puerto Rico. Next year's survey will include high schools. In the following analysis the three figures represent student enrollment, number of teachers, and number of years of Russian offered. Georgetown University-218, 6, 4; University of Miami-160, 2, 4; Ran- dolph-Macon Woman's College-115, 2, 3; Louisiana State University and A. and M.-96, 2, 2; Florida State University-95, 3, 3; University of North Carolina-95, 2, 3; VanderbiiL University-82, 3, 4; University of Tennessee-59, 1, 3; University of Virginia-52, 2, 3; University of Georgia-50, 1, 4 quarters; College of William and Mary-37, 2, 2; Em- ory University-30, 1, 5 quarters; University of South Carolina-26, 1, 3; University of Chattanooga-20, 1, 1; Washington and Lee University-- 11, 1, 2; University of Southwest Louisiana-10, 2, 2; Georgia Insti- tute of Technology-8, (8), 2; Inter- American University of Puerto Rico -8, 1, 2. The total number of students for eighteen institutions is 1172. Tolstoy on the Fiftieth Anniver- sary of His Death-Eva Friedl, Uni- versity of Miami. Tolstoy died attempting to flee his family, ending at 82 a long, compli- cated life as landowner, wealthy count, husband, father of thirteen, soldier, writer. Criticized because his personal life was at variance with his philosophy, excommunicated, he devoted himself to the peasants and writing, becoming towards the end J a legendary figure. The inner drama y of discord which marked the last thir- ty years of his life had tragic conse- r quences for Tolstoy and those who d tried personally to resist his com- manding greatness. He was unable to s reconcile the dichotomy in his philos ophy. Non-resistance was only the g negative side of his gospel of love. f Lenin called Tolstoy's teaching "an opiate for the people," but Gandhi found a power politically significant in the efforts to liberate India. The significance increases as nations seek peace and an end to the violence Tol- stoy so unerringly unmasked. Tolstoy today awaits his renaissance, his rec- ognition as a man of fate and a great 3 citizen of the world. * * * * An Experiment in Teaching Rus- sian to Younger School Children- Harold L. Titus, N. C. State College. This paper deals with the methods used and the results obtained in teach- ing two classes of school children in the age groups six to ten and eleven to thirteen. * * * * Under the Rug of Russian Gram- mar-Walter W. Arndt, University of North Carolina. Selected for brief treatment are two of the many areas of Russian grammar where simple structural pat- terns have been obscured by tradition- al presentation, or where items impor- tant for a full understanding of struc- ture, message, or style are habitually "swept under the rug." The two areas are (1) noun declension and the basic character and operative con- trasts of the case system, and (2) the so-called "modal particles." The pattern of noun declension in both numbers is shown to be dedu- cible to three declensions, one non- feminine and two feminine, and the eight cases are arranged into the Ja- kobsonian cubic system of three con- trastive planes and their opposites. The second part of the paper seeks to define, by non-semantic criteria, a distinct class of utterance-modifiers which have defied traditional part- of- speech and part-of-sentence analysis -marginal morphemes like da, ze, ved', uz, to, and i. In the context of a minimal declarative utterance a set of observable formal characteristics is assembled, yielding the following criteria: morphemic brevity, position, stress, pitch configuration, juncture, elicitability, predicate compatibility. With the aid of these criteria (which are of unequal utility) a class of modal particles is posited as distinct from the functionally adjacent classes of adverbs of manner, objective modal adverbs, subjective modal adverbs and/or modal parentheses. * * * * Pasternak and Tolstoy-Ihor A. Levitsky, University of Georgia. Pasternak's references to Tolstoy and Tolstoyism in Doctor Zhivago are discussed. The fact that Tolstoy's name is frequently mentioned in cru- cial passages dealing with problems of the philosophy of history, art, and literature suggests that the views of Tolstoy, with whom Pasternak often disagrees, nevertheless may have stimulated Pasternak's own thinking on these subjects. * * * * New Soviet Source Material on Boris Godunov-Berthold C. Fried;, University of Miami. New light on Pushkin's Boris Go- dunov was shed by a 1959 Soviet edi- tion of The Works of Pushkin. Of notable interest is Pushkin's letter (written in French) in which he in- dicates that he patterned his epic poem after Shakespeare. The tech- nique of Shakespeare, he explains, was far more suited to the Russian temperament than the unities of Aristotle. Another myth is exploded in the revelations of two polemical articles written by Pushkin, who had been unjustly accused of plagiarizing ma- terial for Boris Godunov from the novel Vyzheegin by Bulgarin, who is said to have been the official censor. These articles, drawn from the Soviet State Archives, reveal that it was Grech, Bulgarin's collaborator, who stole material from Pushkin and made it appear that Pushkin was guilty of plagiarism. Despite the official and unofficial criticism and persecution of Pushkin before the publication of Boris Godu- nov (its publication was delayed five years by the censors), it was hailed by Gogol as the top dramatic achieve- ment of the time and a work of gen- ius. * * * * SOUTHEASTERN AMERICAN STUDIES ASSOCIATION Chairman-Eugene Current-Garcia, Auburn University.

Reid, Fur- man University. Even though a small backwoods town of about 600 in 1825, Greenville developed a vigorous intellectual lifc. Bookstores, a library society, a liter- ary club, a lyceum, and, later, Fu;- man University encouraged literacy. Low-country tourists like Joel R. Poinsett stimulated this development and helped bring out a latent Union- ist sentiment. A short-lived literary magazine and four newspapers be- fore 1860 carried short stories, essays, and poems which after 1850 grew more sarcastic toward secessionists. Benjamin Franklin Perry, lawyer, judge, legislator, Reconstruction gov- ernor, editor, essayist, and the lead- ing spirit of this culture, was an arch-critic of Calhoun and of nullifi- cation and secession. * * * * Mercantile Library Associations in America: Their Formative Period- Weymouth T. Jordan, Florida State University. John Hamilton Cornish: A South Carolina Priest and His Books-Clyde H. Cantrell, Auburn University. John Hamilton Cornish, 1815-1878, was a South Carolina clergyman from 1843 until his death. His life and reading habits have been studied fro;n the Cornish Diary at the University of North Carolina Library. After sketching the life of Mr. Cornish, his reading habits are dis- cussed under four divisions. A total of 192 publications has been ac- counted for in the Cornish Diary from 1833 through the year 1861, 73 titles referring to books in religion and church publications. Other strong areas of reading are the classics, Eng- lish and American literature, and his- tory. Cornish was a well-read indi- vidual for his time. * * * * SPANISH I Chairman-Victor R. B. Oelschliigei, Florida State University. Secretary-Lucile K. Delano, Win- throp College. The Indirect Interrogative in Old Spanish-James R. Chatham, Missis- sippi State University. The syntax and semantic values of the interrogative noun clause in twenty representative works in medie- val and renaissance Spanish were discussed. The indirect question was most often the object of a transitive verb or paraphrase denoting com- munication, thought, or perception. The free indirect interrogative which has the exterior appearance of the direct question, was found forty- two times in the works studied. This construction followed the tense se- quence and pronoun transposition of the subordinate clause. The interrogative noun clause was greatly overworked in Old Spanish. The narration of events and conver- sations in many cases reached mo- notonous proportions and almost en- tirely replaced the more lively stylis- tic device of dialogue. * * * * The Duke of Rivas' Pessimism- Nicholson B. Adams, University of North Carolina. The productions of the Duke of Rivas were neo-classic until he was about forty years old. The roman- ticism of the Moro exposito and the Romances historicos was largely ex- ternal, and the tone of his lyric poems relatively calm. This paper suggests that the apparent pessimism and the melodramatic quality of Don Alvaro, only one play out of a total of fourteen, responded to very tem- porary French influence. In general, Rivas was a fairly calm, well ad- justed, and happy individual. * * * * The Theater of Diego Sanchez de Badajoz: An Appreciafion of La fat- sa de la hechizera-Gladstone R. Fluegge, Florida State University. Farsa de la hechizera, a wedding play, is a keen social satire. The play is developed through the comic char- acters of the devil and the negress and the more common pastor and gal- gant. The rapid action is unusual in this period but the lusty humor pre- sents immediate audience appeal. The limitations of the theater do not in- trude upon enjoyment of this play even today, for the author has achieved a freedom of movement through facility of style. * * * * SPANISH II Chairman-Lawrence A. Sharpe, Unr'- versity of North Carolina. Secretary-Kathryn Martin, Mary- ville College. Ana Maria Matute: Primera me- moria-Armand E. Singer, West Vir- ginia University. The 1959 Nadal prize winner ib Ana Maria Matute's Primera me- moria. Author of several well-received volumes of short stories and novels, she is one of the most promising younger Spanish novelists. This volume, first of a projected trilogy, relates the difficult maturing process in a sensitive, romantic gh'l of fourteen, sent to live during the Civil War far from home with her cousin Borja's family on the Balearic Islands. The novel presents little ac- tion, being mainly a character study of adolescence-its inherent sense of loneliness, its cruelty and viciousness (seen principally in Borja), its lack of sympathy with the adult outlook- favorite Matute themes. The style, romantic, impressionistic, and nat- uralistic in turn, occasionally strained, turgid, even obscure, often recalls Valle-Inclan and Pardo Ba- zan. Though basically a traditional Spanish work, the novel touches on such modern, un-Spanish themes as homosexuality and the influence of environment over the individual: e.g., the effect of the tropical sun upon the heroine. The many characters m the story are strongly drawn and although no masterpiece, it is solidly conceived and ably executed. * * * * The Trend toward a Native Tradi- tion in Paraguayan Poetry-William H. Roberts, Vanderbilt University. A belated romanticism still domi- nated Paraguayan poetry in 1911, when Eloy Farina Nuniiez published his Canto secular, which celebrated the first century of national indepen- dence and invited Paraguayans to assess their culture and look hope- fully to the future. The next decade saw the development of a poetry around native themes, in Guarani with the verse of Narciso Roman Colman, and in Spanish, with that of Manuel Ortiz Guerrero. The original note of Ortiz Guerrero was the inter- weaving of his own suffering with the Paraguayan landscape. The direc- tion that he pointed-toward the de- velopment of native folkloric elements -was fruitfully taken by Julio Cor- rea, who also showed a considerable advance in technical skill. The gen- eral trend indicated by all these poets has culminated in Elvio Ro- mero (born 1926), whose four vol- umes of poetry so far published re- J-anuary, 1961 SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN Page Seventeen</page><page sequence="11">Page Eighteen SOUTH ATLANTIC BULLETIN January, 196i veal a highly original imagery com- bined with a deep and desperate feel- ing for his country, its landscape and all its dwellers. The Art of PNrez de Hita in His Guerras civiles de Granada-Weston Flint, Duke University. At the end of the sixteenth cen- tury in Spain there was a literary gap left by the decay of good epic poetry and by the absence of any first-rate serious fiction of an idealis- tic nature. Gines Perez de Hita, in his Guerras civiles (primera parte, 1595), produced what is, essentially, a historical novel, or historical ro- mance which applies the ethical sys- tem of medieval Christian chivalry not only to the Moorish and Christian caballeros who struggled against eaci other in the Kingdom of Granada in the late fifteenth century, but mor,: importantly, to the Moors in their internal strife. Like the Amadis de Gaula, the Guerras civiles contains a poetic ex&amp;ltation of love, justice, loyalty, gallantry, and chivalric ad- venture in the most idealistic chival- ric tradition. Hita's work made a successful appearance at a time when the public taste for the romances of chivalry had waned and when, in Spanish literature, the critical obser- vation of reality had largely over- shadowed neoplatonic idealism. The success of the work may perhaps be explained by the attractiveness of the theme and the art of Pirez de Hita. Gathering his materials from oral tradition (especia lly romances viejos and fronterizos, as well as from later romances moriscos), and from chron- icles (both Christian and Moorish), Perez de Hita succeeds in harmoniz- ing diverse elements in artistic form. By interweaving history and legend, and by his effective addition of po- etical and fanciful elements, he cre- ated a prose narrative which is truly artistic and which successfully fills the aforementioned gap in idealistic Spanish fiction. TEACHING PROBLEMS Chairman-Shasta M. Bryant, Uni- versity of Miami. Secretary-Sanford H. Newell, Con- verse College. Ability Grouping of Language Classes-George B. Daniel, Univer- sity of North Carolina. Since 1917, when its first honors programs were inaugurated, the Uni- versity of North Carolina has cre- ated four optional programs in whier students of superior performance and ability can participate. These are: (1) advanced standing; (2) special freshman sections and the freshmar. honors program, (3) advanced offer- ings for sophomores, and (4) semi- nars and honors programs for juniors and seniors. In addition to active par- ticipation in the programs mentioned, the Department of Romance Lan- guages provides other means for rapid advancement. Students who have com- pleted degree requirements of a given language are encouraged to enroll in a special two semester course of a new language which, when completed, will be the equivalent of four semes- ters. Secondly, students are placed in sections appropriate to their capac- ities. By providing means for rapid advancement in the lower level courses, continued interest in upper level courses has been assured. An Experiment with Large Classes in Beginning Spanish-I. R. Wer- show, University of Florida. With increased enrollments and no prospect of additional staff, the De- partment of Foreign Languages at the University of Florida initiated a single, unlimited-registration sec- tion for beginning Spanish. A new textbook was written for the course. It consisted of 70 lessons, 28 class lectures, 28 laboratory periods, and 14 one-hour tests. A short quiz was given in each laboratory period. At the end of the semester the student was expected to have mastered all basic grammatical patterns, 1600 com- mon words, and 100 common idioms. He had also read 200 pages of Span- ish. At the end of the year our evalu- ation of results was as follows: over- all preparation-excellent; ability to read-well developed; aural ability- good; writing-poor; speaking-com- paratively poor. The Department does not advocate large-section languag e teaching as the solution to increased enrollments, but we believe that our system has the following advantages: 1) inten- sification of presentation permits in- clusion of about twice the normal amount of material; 2) the intensive testing program makes regular study imperative; 3) better students are challenged, weak and lazy students are quickly dropped; 4) the increase in material and improvement in standards decreases failures in subse- New Readers Imaginacion y fantasia Yates and Dalbor This collection of twelve stories by well-known Spanish American writers offers unsimplified material arranged according to level of dli- ficulty.
