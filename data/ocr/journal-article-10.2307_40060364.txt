<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Laboratory Animals Jed Mayer British vivisection debates of the late nineteenth century used emotions to redraw the ever-shifting boundaries between the human and nonhuman animal. Emotional responses to pain, specifically the pain inflicted on nonhuman animals used in scientific experiments, were at the center of these debates. While the emotional capacities of the experimental animal- its ability to feel anguish, fear, and despair in ways comparable or comprehensible to the human observer- were scrutinized and debated, the emotional responses of human beings to animal suffering were also at issue. In the 1870s and 1880s the problem of animal suffering was placed before the public gaze, exposing the principles, methodology, and practices conducted behind the closed doors of the physiological laboratory. Not surprisingly, these scenes of laboratory life elicited highly emotional responses from the lay reading public. At the same time, they revealed animal researchers to be equally passionate, involved in deeply emotional relationships with their nonhuman subjects. As phys- iologist and surgeon James Paget argued in 1881, "The sensibility to pain is as various as is the 'ear for music"' (922). While Paget was refer- ring to the relative ability of the experimental subject to respond to painful stimulus, his claim might well apply to the varied responses of vivisection advocates and opponents during these years of heated controversy. This was not a debate between two distinct sides, but Abstract: Similarities between human and animal emotions served as justification for both animal advocacy and animal experimentation in the later nineteenth century. Evolutionary kinship played a central role, at this time, in the competing arguments regarding the legal and moral status of nonhuman animals. During the vivisection debates of the 1870s, natural hierarchies were redrawn to include emotional sensitivity as a defining category of evolutionary status: a lack of sensitivity to animal suffering in humans could be regarded as regressive, while the highly developed sensitivities of particular animals earned them a special eminence. But it was this same cross-species sympathy that ultimately banished the experimental animal from the public gaze, as scenes from the laboratory were considered too disturbing to readerly sensitivity. SPRING 2008</page><page sequence="2">400 JED MAYER rather one in which a surprising diversity of sensibilities emerged regarding the relationship between the human and the nonhuman.1 Widespread opposition to vivisection in Great Britain developed in response to a dramatic rise in the number of experiments performed on live animals beginning in 1870 but was continuous with the nine- teenth century's growing animal welfare movement.2 While prominent members of antivivisection organizations like the Victoria Street Society and the International Association for the Total Suppression of Vivisec- tion had been active in more moderate animal welfare organizations like the RSPCA, during the vivisection controversies British animal advo- cacy went well beyond its philanthropic foundations, challenging the very scientific foundations of anthropocentrism. By reconfiguring the place of the emotions in evolutionary hierarchies of development, anti- vivisectionists effectively blurred the division between humans and nonhumans in order to question assumptions of human uniqueness. It is not surprising that the relationship between the human and the nonhuman should be so crucial to the vivisection debates given the fact that most scientific research on animals was conducted on the principle that any discoveries made would be more or less appli- cable to humans. Evolutionary theory, of course, provided a scientific foundation for interspecies comparisons, particularly as the practical implications of Darwin's insights were developed in the writings and lectures of evolutionary apostles like Thomas Henry Huxley and George Romanes. These practical implications inspired a new genera- tion of medical and scientific professionals in Great Britain who hoped to raise experimental physiology to the level of professionalism and esteem it enjoyed in advanced research institutions on the Continent. In his account of the rise of experimental physiology at Cambridge under the direction of Michael Foster, Gerald Geison emphasizes the influence of Darwin's theories on native physiological practices, claiming that "if English physiology did have a 'national style,' and if that style were to be captured in a single word, no better choice could be made than 'evolutionary'" (335). Though the "comparative outlook" of British physiological research had been evident some time before the publication of On the Origin of Species (1859), it was, according to Geison, "the extent to which English physiologists espoused and utilized Darwinian evolutionary theory that set them apart most clearly from their European colleagues" (334). Many of the key figures of late-Victorian physiology received their VICTORIAN STUDIES / VOLUME 50, NO. 3</page><page sequence="3">THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS IN MAN AND LABORATORY ANIMALS 401 theoretical inspiration from a course of lectures conducted by Huxley in South Kensington. In demonstrating the physical properties of various biological "types," Huxley stressed the anatomical continuity between them. As one of those attending the lectures fondly remembered, these types were not treated as the isolated things they necessarily appear in a laboratory manual or an examination syllabus; each, on the contrary, took its proper place as an example of a particular grade of structure, and no student of ordinary intelligence could fail to see that the types were valuable, not for them- selves, but simply as marking, so to speak, the chapters of a connected narrative, (qtd. in Huxley 380) This narrative continuity between biological types was important, not only for lending British physiology a conceptual foundation, but also for providing the proponents of vivisection with a rhetorical founda- tion when publicly defending their research practices, as we shall see. Yet this "connected narrative" between organic types could also bridge the gap between the human and the nonhuman in ways which under- mined the public image of the scientific community in Great Britain. The evolutionary continuity between species that helped to inaugurate the emergence of this professional physiological regime also could be seen as implicitly challenging the ethical foundations of vivisection. Physiological connections between humans and nonhuman animals bespoke other connections, cognitive and emotional, which would significantly complicate the use of evolutionary models as a founda- tion for British physiological research. While the publication of Darwin's The Descent of Man and Selec- tion in Relation to Sex in 1871 was denounced by many for claiming to demonstrate that human beings were essentially highly developed animals, Darwin's next work on the subject, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), was calculated to appeal to more mainstream British sentiments.3 Filled with anecdotal observations of animals beloved by the British public (including dogs, cats, horses, and cows) and the chimpanzees and orangutans that spectators flocked to see in London's Zoological Gardens, Darwin's work made evolutionary theory appealing to the growing population of English horse fanciers, pet owners, and animal welfare advocates. The essential arguments derived from these observations of shared emotional responses in human and nonhuman animals were, of course, nothing new in Darwin's work. As early as the Origin of Species, Darwin had argued, "The fact that the lower SPRING 2008</page><page sequence="4">402 JED MAYER animals are excited by the same emotions as ourselves is so well estab- lished, that it will not be necessary to weary the reader by many details" (245). The later work on interspecies emotions would seem to reflect Darwin's own continuing fascination with the subject, one that he shared with many of his contemporaries.4 The homely portraits of dogs fawning at their master's knees, cats arching their backs and purring while rubbing against a welcome leg, and horses whinnying in friendly greeting serve to domesticate the same evolutionary narrative that had raised human hackles just three years earlier, in response to The Descent of Man. By representing evolutionary theory in these familiar domestic terms, stressing the common links that forge emotional as well as biolog- ical bonds between people and their companion animals, Darwin placed his otherwise unsettling theories of descent within an evolving culture of compassion toward nonhuman animals.5 Leslie Stephen, in his own contribution to the vivisection debate, was one among many public intel- lectuals who would applaud this shift in nineteenth-century sensibility: "The widening recognition of the truth that men are responsible for the happiness of the creatures whose lives are entirely dependent upon us . . . shows a gratifying tendency, which clearly ought to be encouraged" (477). Yet this "gratifying tendency" seemed to be threatened implicitly by recent trends in physiological research, and Stephen voices a commonly expressed concern when he warns that "knowledge and morality must progress together" (477). But since "the most distinct advance in morality has been the growth of tender feeling towards men and animals" (477), the place of the nonhuman animal in scientific research would seem to be an unusually vexed one, making more apparent the growing divide between otherwise parallel advances in scientific knowledge and the progressive culture of compassion. Darwin's Expression can be read as a transitional work in scien- tific representations of the nonhuman, a nexus between sentiment and science that would become increasingly unstable and conflicted in the coming years. Emphasizing the primacy of our emotional connections to animals as a means of persuading readers of our evolutionary connections, Darwin lays a biological foundation for the era's culture of compassion. The familiar emotional responses in "the commoner animals," as well as more extreme responses such as fear, pain, and aggressiveness, are read as prefiguring human emotions, "affording the safest basis for generalization on the causes, or origin, of the various movements of Expression. In observing animals," Darwin VICTORIAN STUDIES / VOLUME 50, NO. 3</page><page sequence="5">THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS IN MAN AND LABORATORY ANIMALS 403 continues, "we are not so likely to be biased by our imagination; and we may feel safe that their expressions are not conventional" (17). The emotional expressions of nonhuman animals are seen as being more genuine and less susceptible to misinterpretation than those of humans and so may serve as a more accurate physiological record of the evolu- tionary theories the book adumbrates. Significantly, the communica- tive relationship between humans and nonhuman animals is here figured as a more direct one than that between human beings: humans might feign emotional responses, but animals never lie. Darwin shared with his philozoic readers a faith in the ability of human beings to read and understand the emotions of nonhuman animals. This might be seen as the central rhetorical foundation of both animal rights advocates and physiologists, in that each presumed to interpret the emotional signs of animals accurately. Indeed, it may be argued that the late-Victorian vivisection debates centered upon alterna- tive interpretations of the emotional expressions that both sides so closely scrutinized. Antivivisectionists by and large based their under- standing of animal suffering on their own sympathetic observations of and emotional relationships with animals, primarily domestic pets- an understanding which advocates of vivisection frequently deemed merely sentimental. Commenting on prominent antivivisectionist Frances Power Cobbe's overly narrow focus on cats and dogs in her polemical writings, John Robertson observed that "she is not defending a right inherent in sentient things as such; she is doing special pleading for some of them for which she has a special liking" (qtd. in French 375). One writer for the Lancet argued that the limited perceptions of vivisection's non-scientific critics divested them of their right to criticize: "Charges of cruelty have been brought indiscriminately by persons who are not quali- fied to give an opinion" (qtd. in Hamilton 3: 71). In contrast to the alleg- edly oversensitive anthropomorphism of the antivivisectionists, scientists claimed knowledge of their research subjects that was at once more specific and more general, regarding animals as particular biological specimens whose functions revealed universal phenomena.6 The more precise observations achieved through rational inquiry were often alleged to reveal that animals did not feel pain or experience emotions in the same way human beings conventionally understood them. In an early essay on vivisection, the physician Gilbert Child argued in the Westminster Review that "What are commonly spoken of as 'the ordi- nary indications of pain' are all of them more or less fallacious" (134). SPRING 2008</page><page sequence="6">404 JED MAYER Later in the century, William Collier, writing as president of the British Medical Association, argued that "In dealing with animals it is necessary to consider carefully what signs may be depended upon as proofs of their suffering. Certainly their struggles and cries are not always true indica- tions" (624). The reading of physiological signifiers of emotions in animals was thus made highly contentious during the vivisection debates, with the advocates of vivisection creating, in their skeptical readings of animal expressions, a kind of hermeneutics of suspicion regarding the interpre- tation of nonhuman emotions. While Darwin could once claim that "the lower animals are excited by the same emotions as ourselves" (Origin 245) and could later demonstrate our common ability to interpret these emotions, advocates of vivisection cast doubt on the layperson's ability to read the signs of animal suffering accurately. Although blanket dismissals of animal suffering might serve to mitigate public concerns over the suffering of animals in laborato- ries, they also seemed to undermine the narrative continuity of evolu- tionary development that otherwise served as the theoretical foundation to British physiology. The widely acknowledged emotional continuum linking humans with other animals further complicated the use of a "connected narrative" for the purposes of advancing physi- ological research. Negations of animal suffering and dismissals of animal emotions ran counter to the country's evolving culture of compassion; however unwilling some may have been to accept Darwinian claims of biological kinship with their nonhuman compan- ions, fewer yet were willing to deny their common emotional bonds. Emotional connections between species had become so central to British discourses surrounding the nonhuman that even the physio- logical laboratory itself was suffused with emotional exchanges between human researcher and nonhuman subject, despite all attempts to seal the research space off from emotional contagion. In the physiological laboratory of the later nineteenth century, the border between the human and the nonhuman could frequently become blurred, even as the preeminence of scientific authority at this period depended upon a strict maintenance of interspecies borders and hierarchies.7 The detached, unemotional stance of the scientific observer needed to be maintained rigorously in order to protect the experimental physiologist from the brutalizing influences of his inves- tigations.8 Further considering the moral problems raised by vivisec- tion, Leslie Stephen observes: "The practice which is justifiable because VICTORIAN STUDIES / VOLUME 50, NO. 3</page><page sequence="7">THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS IN MAN AND LABORATORY ANIMALS 405 implying laudable motives graduates imperceptibly into the practice which is execrable because implying sheer brutality" (476). To counter this tendency toward the merely brutal, Stephen emphasizes the impor- tance of constructing a laboratory regimen "which may serve as a moral prophylactic, and enable a man to pass unscathed through the risks of contagion" (476). The strict experimental regimen laid down in works like John Burdon-Sanderson's influential Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory (1873), itself influenced by Claude Bernard's seminal Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine (1865), could serve to some extent as a kind of protection against the moral and emotional qualms of the sensitive vivisectionist, but the division between scientific observer and research subject was never certain. As much as the strict experimental regimen served the vivisec- tionist as moral and emotional prophylaxis, the physiological labora- tory was nevertheless a place of highly charged emotional interactions across the species divide. In his discussion of animal emotions in The Descent of Man, Darwin notes: "In the agony of death a dog has been known to caress his master, and every one has heard of the dog suffering under vivisection, who licked the hand of the operator; this man, unless the operation was fully justified by an increase of our knowledge, or unless he had a heart of stone, must have felt remorse to the last hour of his life" (90). The sentimentality of this pathetic scene from laboratory life would not be out of place in an antivivisection pamphlet, and its presence in Darwin's major contribution to evolu- tionary literature is a particularly dramatic instance of the close rhetor- ical ties between the late-Victorian scientific community and its critics.9 This passage also vividly dramatizes the vulnerability of Stephen's "moral prophylactic," with scientific justification for the operation giving way to remorse at this display of interspecies kinship. In an essay for the Contemporary Review, Frances Power Cobbe observes that "Men and beasts are, in scientific language, alike 'specimens' (wretched word!)" and concludes that the "light of Science is a 'dry' one" ("Scien- tific" 254). Yet in licking the hand of the scientific operator, the dog of Darwin's anecdote serves as a carrier of emotional contagion, infecting the laboratory with sentiment and paradoxically showing the likeness of "men and beasts." Thus, in addition to the strict professional regimen, the reinforcement of classic hierarchies ordering the species served to protect the physiological researcher from such unwonted reminders of emotional kinship. SPRING 2008</page><page sequence="8">406 JED MAYER Hierarchical distinctions between species were aggressively maintained in discourses surrounding the emotions, particularly responses to pain. In her study of cultural representations of pain, Lucy Bending finds that eighteenth-century notions of sensibility defined by social rank are developed and refined in nineteenth-century medical discourses into a hierarchy of sensibility that could include the nonhuman as well as the human. Evolutionary narratives of sensitivity to pain served to brutalize so-called primitive races or "savages": "Lower down the evolutionary scale than civilized westerners, they are less sensitive to refinements of feeling, both emotionally and physically, and necessarily so, for it is their sensitivity that has allowed evolution to take place at a more advanced rate in civilized people" (Bending 123). Such hierar- chical distinctions between races could also be used to justify scientific dominion over other species, and the apparent indication of suffering in animals could be mitigated or even negated by the evolutionary restruc- turing of suffering itself. After comparing the diversity of responses to pain with the similarly variable "ear for music," physiologist James Paget goes on to argue that "as we may be sure of the contrast between the higher and the lower races of men, so we may believe that the contrast must be yet greater between ourselves and any of the animals lower than man" (922). Paget confidently concludes that "with every degree of dimi- nution of the proportion which the nervous system bears to the rest of the body there is an equal diminution of the sensibility to pain- the lower in the scale of nature the less the sensibility" (922). This evolu- tionary hierarchy serves to retain the physiological continuum between species, so instrumental to British physiology, while at the same time alleviating moral and emotional anxieties concerning the suffering of the experimental animal. The border between the human and the nonhuman created in such a hierarchical model might be regarded as a kind of evolutionary prophylaxis protecting the human from misgivings regarding the wanton infliction of suffering on his animal kin. Emotional responses in the research subject are real and readable, yet they operate at a lower level of significance on moral and evolutionary scales, thus warranting negligible ethical concern. Accounts of the emotional responses of animals became highly visible in the British press during the 1870s in response to increased public concern over vivisection, making the physiological and emotional barriers between species harder to maintain. One account of laboratory life that had an especially profound and far-reaching emotional impact VICTORIAN STUDIES / VOLUME 50, NO. 3</page><page sequence="9">THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS IN MAN AND LABORATORY ANIMALS 407 was Dr. George Hoggan's letter to the Morning Post of 1 February 1875, reprinted many times afterward in mainstream and antivivisectionist publications and instrumental in helping to bring about the Royal Commission investigation of the same year. As a former student under Claude Bernard, Hoggan had participated in painful experiments on live animals, and his letter restores the emotional dimension of labora- tory life so conspicuously absent from the accounts given by Bernard's other famous English pupil, John Burdon-Sanderson, in his Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory. Like one of the domestic pets in Darwin's Expression of the Emotions, dogs brought out of their cages for experimen- tation would, according to Hoggan, "make friendly advances to each of the three or four persons present, and, as far as eyes, ears, and tail could make a mute appeal for mercy eloquent, they tried it in vain" (521). Though the "mute appeal" made by these animals might have failed to move its intended recipients, Hoggan's transcription of emotional expressions and their cool reception dramatizes the contrast between sensitive animal and unfeeling scientist that would become a staple of antivivisectionist rhetoric. Significantly, Darwin's own accounts of animal emotions had provided the British public with a kind of primer for reading these signs of suffering. Yet Hoggan's account emphasizes the very different inter- pretations that might be made of such "mute appeal [s]." "Were the feel- ings of experimental physiologists not blunted," Hoggan observes, "they could not long continue the practice of vivisection" (522). While this emotional prophylaxis might protect the operator from contagion, it also effectively detaches the physiologist from the emotional continuum linking humans and nonhuman animals. Hoggan elaborates on the emotional gap between experimental scientist and subject with a scene similar to that depicted by Darwin: while being prepared for experimen- tation by Bernard's students, the dogs "would continue to lick the hand which bound them till their mouths were fixed in the gag, and they could only flap their tail in the trough as their last means of exciting compas- sion" (521). The pathos of this scene is intensified by the dogs' eloquent appeal falling on the apparently deaf ears and blind eyes of their opera- tors, illustrating the immense emotional gap between operator and subject while at the same time speaking to a readership well-versed in reading the emotional signs of animals. Although antivivisectionists often set themselves in opposition to the rhetorical conventions of nineteenth-century scientific culture SPRING 2008</page><page sequence="10">408 JED MAYER altogether, their arguments and vocabulary were just as often appro- priated from the scientific language of their opponents, sometimes turning it against them, and sometimes developing alternative conclu- sions from the same evidence used in support of vivisection. This prac- tice is particularly evident in the antivivisectionists' distinctive use of evolutionary models of sensibility. In contrast to vivisection advocates like Paget, however, antivivisectionists used this hierarchical order of being to measure sensibility to the suffering of others, particularly the suffering of nonhuman animals. In the antivivisectionist hierarchy, the experimenter is inevitably ranked quite low in the natural order. As Bending observes, "The infliction of pain brutalized, made those who practiced it more like the brutes and savages from whom the civi- lized had dissociated themselves evolutionarily over the course of time" (126). Paul H. White elaborates: "Evolutionary continuities between humans and animals, useful in underwriting practices like vivisection and ethology, could also facilitate claims about the degeneration of gentlemen of science' whose natural sympathies for their human and animal fellows had been deadened by the abstract pursuit of truth" (75). At the same time, however, this "degeneration" was not always figured exclusively as deadening. The bestializing influence at work in the physiological laboratory often involved a more complex emotional relationship between the human operator and the nonhuman animal. The evolutionary focus of British physiology, and its parallel emer- gence within the nineteenth century's evolving culture of compassion, encouraged advocates of vivisection to adopt a more expressly emotional stance in their portrayal of scientific investigation. Empha- sizing their kinship with their research subjects authorized the vivisec- tionist's right to speak for them. Rather than disavowing the evolutionary connection between human operator and nonhuman subject, many vivisection advocates sought instead to reconfigure the emotional landscape of the physio- logical laboratory on their own terms. Emotional connections forged between the human and the nonhuman under the duress of painful experiments could serve as evidence of the connected narrative autho- rizing animal experimentation for human benefit. Vivisection comes to figure as an emotional catharsis which serves to make visible man's evolutionary heritage, as primal instincts bring about a sympathetic merging of human and nonhuman animal on the operating table. In a defense of vivisection addressed to the readers of Nature, zoologist VICTORIAN STUDIES / VOLUME 50, NO. 3</page><page sequence="11">THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS IN MAN AND LABORATORY ANIMALS 409 Edwin Ray Lankester claims that there "is no lack of sympathy with the probable sufferings of animals experimented upon in the mind of the physiologist. He suffers with them . . . and the mutual suffering of both vivisector and vivisected becomes a sacrifice offered upon the altar of science" (145). Another writer for Nature further develops Lankester's assertion, arguing that "so far from producing a hardening effect on the mind, these experiments seem to engender in the mind of the observer a love and a care for the brute creation, that does not exist in the mind of an ordinary person" ("Vivisection" 178). George Henry Lewes could even claim a place for experimental physiology in the progressive culture of compassion: The advance of culture has brought with it an increased tenderness, and a more solicitous regard for the feelings of others, a regard extending slowly but surely to the feelings of animals also. It is to Science that this advance is mainly due. Only by gaining clear conceptions of natural sequences can men be brought to repress their native tendency to inflict pain as an exertion of power, or to feel ashamed of their thoughtless indifference when they see pain inflicted by others. (144) Not surprisingly, this image of the sensitive vivisector would not prove to be an especially popular one in later defenses of the practice, yet the positioning of the experimental physiologist as an authoritative inter- preter of the nonhuman would continue to serve as a means of justi- fying painful experiments to a skeptical public. The physiologist's extensive knowledge of natural processes could be used as a means of authorizing his right to speak for nature. As intimate observers of the natural order, vivisection advocates could represent themselves as speaking from a privileged position outside of the narrow restrictions of social mores and conventions. In an impas- sioned defense of vivisection to readers of Macmillan's, Michael Foster, Cambridge's first full-time professor of physiology and the discipline's most active promoter, argues that "Biologists and physiologists are at the present moment clearly in disrepute" essentially because they follow the ways of nature before those of culture: "Following out their own science, along the path Nature has pointed out to them, they have run counter to many established opinions and cherished views" (367). Like Lankester, Foster argues that emotional sensitivity to the suffering of nonhuman animals is incompatible with the discoveries of evolu- tionary science that establish humanity's place within the natural struggle for survival: SPRING 2008</page><page sequence="12">410 JED MAYER The success of the human race in the struggle for existence depends on man's being well fed; man is therefore justified in slaying and eating a sheep. The success of the human race in the struggle for existence is dependent on knowledge being increased; man is therefore justified in slaying a frog or a rabbit, if it can be shown that human knowledge is thereby enlarged. (369) Indeed, man is not only justified in such acts but is obliged to commit them for his survival: "Unless man destroys animals, animals would soon destroy man" (368). Employing Darwin's theory with a literalness that might have surprised its framer, Foster transforms the physiolog- ical laboratory into a place of deadly struggle for man's ascendancy over the brute natural order: Mr. Darwin has shown that the lives of all living beings are shaped by 'the struggle for existence.' Man's life is a struggle for existence with his fellow-men, with living animals and plants, and with the lifeless forces of the universe. The very condi- tions of his existence lay upon him the burden, and in so doing give him the right, to use the world around him, the lives of animals included, to aid him in his strife. Imagine the results of forbidding man to take away the lives of animals. (368) This vision of interspecies warfare places the vivisectionist in the evolu- tionary avant garde, using advanced research techniques in order to maintain human supremacy. The surprising urgency with which an esteemed Cambridge professor like Foster here defends his cause would seem to beg the question whether the frequent accusations of hysteria and oversensitivity directed toward antivivisectionists were really being pointed in the right direction. But the emotional pitch of defences like Foster's and Lankester's are perhaps most appropriately read as reflecting the intensity of the years surrounding the Royal Commission investigation into vivisection. The triumph of scientific reason over the appeal of the emotions might be regarded as an evolutionary triumph of the human over the nonhuman within the laboratory. Yet outside of the laboratory, in the writings of the antivivisectionists, this ascendancy was more often figured as a devolutionary regression. The movement's leading figure, Frances Power Cobbe, was particularly adept at reversing the evolutionary rhet- oric of her opponents. In her 1888 Contemporary Review essay "The Scien- tific Spirit of the Age," Cobbe subverts the scientific values of observation, accuracy, intellectual caution, and inductive method by characterizing these qualities as "only the culmination of the lower range of human faculties; or, more strictly speaking, the perfect application to human VICTORIAN STUDIES / VOLUME 50, NO. 3</page><page sequence="13">THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS IN MAN AND LABORATORY ANIMALS 411 concerns of those faculties which are common to man and the lower animals. A fox may be an observer, and an exceedingly accurate one- of hen roosts" (248). Such inversions of the evolutionary hierarchy were common in antivivisectionist rhetoric, where the struggle between intel- lect and emotions in the physiological laboratory was described in vastly different terms than those used in defenses of vivisection. Challenging the scientific models of social progress used by supporters of vivisection, antivivisectionists presented an alternative model of social progress in which the evolution of emotional sensitivity to suffering is central. This alternative model of moral evolution was devel- oped by figures like Richard Holt Hutton, one-time editor of the Spectator and later the National Review, who frequently used his publications as a platform to denounce vivisection. Responding to a series of articles defending vivisection published in the Nineteenth Century, including the essay by Paget discussed earlier, Hutton adapts Darwinian theory for the antivivisection cause: "I cannot conceive it possible that we can once begin to treat the lower races of animals as destined to benefit us chiefly by their agonies, without extinguishing in ourselves that genuine sympathy which our common nature and common susceptibilities, and indeed, as many men now hold, our common origin, ought to excite" (37). Our "common origin" speaks to a common emotional and moral bond that the practice of vivisection betrays. Hutton goes on to invoke the evolutionary hier- archy of suffering in order to stress the emotional kinship shared with domestic animals who are an integral part of human civilization: For when this treatment is inflicted upon a few score of dogs, and we indignantly denounce it, we are rebuked by this most humane of professions for our grossly sentimental and injurious comments. And yet Dr. Anthony, the pupil and dissector of Sir Charles Bell, assured us when he was giving his evidence to the Royal Commission, that in his opinion the domestic animals are subject to the same special sensibility of the nerves- hyperaesthesia, the doctors call it- to which civi- lization has rendered civilized human beings liable. (36) Employing virtually the same cultural hierarchies as had been used to distinguish the more advanced, sensitive races from so-called savages who were supposedly insensitive to pain, Hutton raises the evolutionary status of the companion animal as a fellow civilized being with the same sensitivities as its would-be masters. Where this left the practitioners of vivisection on the evolutionary scale was a problem for the next genera- tion of antivivisectionists to decide. SPRING 2008</page><page sequence="14">412 JED MAYER Later antivivisectionists would develop an alternative notion of progress in which humans evolved sympathetically toward, rather than away from, the nonhuman. For Anna Kingsford, developments in scien- tific research effectively divested humans of their rights of dominion: "The human race, once beggared of all the attributes which alone enrich and elevate it, has no claim to royalty over the animals, and its salvation can in no wise profit the world" (296). As a medical student, Kingsford had offered her own body for vivisection in place of an experimental animal's, in order to demonstrate that the antivivisectionist challenge to human dominance was more than merely rhetorical (Elston 276). John Ruskin's opposition to vivisection rested on similar principles, and he felt strongly enough to resign his Slade professorship at Oxford over the endowment of a physiological research laboratory at the University.10 During a debate on the issue, Ruskin argued that the vivisectionist's knife effectively cut "the great link which bound together the whole of creation, from its Maker to the lowest creature" (34: 643). If evolutionary theory had provided British physiologists with a theoretical foundation for their research practices, it had also provided their opponents with scientific support for "the great link" between humans and nonhumans that animal welfare advocates had been elaborating for the better part of a century. Antivivisectionists like Mona Caird elevated the moral status of the nonhuman animal from a sentimental indulgence to an issue of general human concern: This is a wrong that involves in its guilt every human being, without exception; for it is perpetrated by the human species upon the animal species, it is a crime of race against race, and therefore its abolition cannot rationally be asked to wait till all the crimes of man against man are put an end to, even were that within measur- able distance. (16) What advocates of vivisection regarded as necessary to the survival of the species, their critics could regard as evidence of humanity's criminal abdication of the rights of dominion over the nonhuman. Without ever fully abandoning hierarchical models of species, the antivivisectionists nevertheless came to challenge the essential superiority of humans to other species. Humanity's position at the head of the Great Chain of Being comes to be an earned rather than endowed status, and the abdi- cation of responsibility toward our nonhuman dependents could place the human operator in a lower position than the dog under his knife. Not only did antivivisectionists believe that the accumulation of knowledge had progressed at the expense of moral regard for the VICTORIAN STUDIES / VOLUME 50, NO. 3</page><page sequence="15">THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS IN MAN AND LABORATORY ANIMALS 413 suffering of one's fellow creatures, but that that knowledge itself came to represent a devolutionary regression. In A Sentimental View of Vivisection (1893), Caird inverts the terms of progress promoted in scientific litera- ture, asserting that, in light of recent developments in British experi- mental physiology, "we are driven to ask ourselves, with horrible doubt of the eventual redemption of our race, whether the civilized state is anything more than an elaboration of barbarism, a new and wider field for the selfishness and brutality of the human animal" (14). Caird 's work is notable for its frequent use of quotations from specialist scientific publications in order to show her readers painful experiments on nonhuman animals unencumbered by any rhetoric of scientific prog- ress. While the turning of animal suffering into public spectacle in anti- vivisectionist publications involved the risk of offending the delicate sensibilities of philozoic readers, becoming merely an elaboration in print of the very "elaboration of barbarism" they sought to expose, Caird and others hoped to challenge the public's willful ignorance about what went on in their nation's premier research institutions. Asking her readers to advance beyond their own self-limited sensibility to suffering, Caird argues, "To believe that anyone can truly know and realize what vivisection means, and still support it, is surely to place him low indeed in the scale of humanity" (22). The "elaboration of barbarism" achieved in the experimental physiological laboratory is sanctioned by a public indif- ference indicative of a low state of evolutionary development, for the British public as well as for the experimental physiologist. The regressive barbarism elaborated by modern science could be seen as hastening the emotional deterioration of an increasingly desensitized nation. Yet such challenges to the public's complicity in the vivisection industry risked alienating an otherwise sympathetic humanitarian constituency. Like their opponents within the scientific community, antivivisectionists were involved in knowledge production. The process of discovery for which the physiological laboratory was designed worked according to a strict regimen, as we have seen. Antivivisection- ists were also involved in a process of discovery, carefully investigating allegations of misconduct and, as Cobbe famously described it in the title of her 1883 antivivisectionist pamphlet, shining "light in dark places." However, the kinds of knowledge antivivisectionists were responsible for disseminating frequently offended public sensibilities in ways similar to the offence raised by the specter of vivisection itself. The 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act drafted in response to the find- SPRING 2008</page><page sequence="16">414 JED MAYER ings of the Royal Commission investigation served to regulate vivisec- tion while at the same time strengthening the barrier between laboratory investigation and the public gaze.11 Excessive cruelty in experimentation on animals could serve as grounds for revoking a physiologist's license, but evidence for such charges was increasingly difficult to gather, partic- ularly for those outside the scientific community. In order to raise public awareness of modern physiological methods, antivivisectionists frequently reprinted published descriptions and illustrations of experi- ments on live animals, often from Continental publications, which tended to be more graphic in their representations. The translation of this material from a scientific to a public context drastically altered the emotional content of the data in potentially explosive ways.12 Established periodicals, many of which had shown support for the antivivisectionist cause, often censured such violations of delicate public sensibilities. Emotional responses to suffering, so crucial for the success of antivivi- sectionist campaigns, could also limit advocates' methods. After readers had criticized the antivivisectionist publication Home Chroniclerfor repro- ducing graphic images from physiological manuals, the editors defended their decision to include the images: "There is something more to be thought of than * delicate feelings,' when we are fighting against a monstrous iniquity like Vivisection, the details of which it is so difficult to bring to the apprehension of the general public" (qtd. in Hamilton I: xxxvii). Paradoxically, the "delicate feelings," here tellingly bracketed off in scare quotes, were once regarded as foundational to the emer- gence of animal welfare advocacy in Britain. By the end of the century, the antivivisectionist cause had gone well beyond its initial charter, chal- lenging rather than encouraging the public's emotional sensitivity toward suffering. Where advocates of vivisection once charged their critics with being oversensitive with regard to animals, those same highly developed sensibilities ultimately secured the experimental animal from public knowledge. The common emotional bond between human and nonhuman animals that once served to prove their biological kinship would eventually serve as a means of division. State University of New York at New Paltz NOTES •The most useful and readily available source of documents from the late-Victo- rian vivisection debates is Hamilton's anthology, which includes Paget's and several other VICTORIAN STUDIES / VOLUME 50, NO. 3</page><page sequence="17">THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS IN MAN AND LABORATORY ANIMALS 415 essays and pamphlets discussed in this paper. The diversity of opinions, particularly marked during the early years of these debates, is illustrated by the fact that many of the same figures appear under both "anti-vivisectionist" and "pro-vivisectionist" headings in Hamilton's arrangement. 2For more on the connections and conflicts between antivivisectionist and earlier, more moderate animal welfare organizations in Great Britain, see Ritvo, Animal 125-66. 3For a discussion of Darwin's ambitions of reaching a popular audience with this work, see Desmond and Moore 592-95. 4Both Ritvo {Animal 41) and Ekman (xxxi-xxxii) note the mingling of scien- tific data with homely, anecdotal accounts of animal behavior in Darwin's Expression, Ekman emphasizing this as one of the reasons for the work's declining esteem in scien- tific circles through much of the twentieth century and Ritvo citing this hybrid quality as one reason for the work's popularity. The Expression sold some 9,000 copies in its first four months (Ekman xxix). Thomas's Man and the Natural World, despite the time span indicated by its title, draws most of its evidence for a fundamental shift in British sensibility regarding the nonhuman from the late eighteenth through the nineteenth centuries. For a more detailed discussion of animal welfare and animal rights in the Victorian context, see Ritvo, Animal 125-204, and Turner 79-121. On this subject in the romantic context, see Perkins 1-43 and Kenyon-Jones 11-50. Lansbury's The Old Brown Dog follows the progress of British animal rights concerns into the early twentieth century (see 152-69). ^o cite one particularly dramatic example of general inferences drawn from indi- vidual experiments on animals, Gore's 1884 pamphlet for The Advancement of Medicine by Research series defends vivisection against its misled critics by arguing "that but few persons have realized the great truth that the essential properties of matter are universal, and that all properly made new experiments therefore yield new knowledge" (3). For a historical and rhetorical analysis of the united medical and scientific front against the antivivisection movement in the 1880s, of which such pamphlets were an important part, see Rupke. 7Ritvo has demonstrated the extensive parallels between the rise of taxonomy in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century scientific culture and changes in the construc- tion of human superiority in the natural. In particular, see Platypus (1-50). Elsewhere, Ritvo draws an explicit connection between the maintenance of professional stature and evolutionary preeminence in nineteenth-century scientific culture: "Besides estab- lishing a natural order, a well-conceived zoological system could help define and dignify the place of both the discipline and its adherents in the human intellectual order" ("Zoological" 235). The blurring of species differences through emotional interactions in the physiological laboratory may certainly be seen as significantly complicating or even undermining this natural and professional order. White argues that the discipline of rigorous professional training in physio- logical research was, at least partially, "designed to minimize or eliminate the distorting influences of human attribution" (60). By transcending any emotional connection to the research subject, the human operator could achieve a more assured transcendence of the "distorting influences" of other connections with the nonhuman. 9It should be noted that even Darwin could not bring himself to practice the experiments that his support of the scientific community during the Royal Commission investigations helped to authorize (Turner 86). French has described the scientists' SPRING 2008</page><page sequence="18">416 JED MAYER lobby as being made up of three main elements: practicing experimental physiologists, elite members of the medical community who approved of vivisection but did not prac- tice it themselves, and biologists like Darwin and Huxley who did not generally experi- ment on live animals (152). 10For an account of Ruskin's resignation in the context of his evolving attitudes toward science and the nonhuman animal, see Mayer. "French (159-76) details the antivivisectionists' dissatisfaction with the 1876 Act. See also Turner 92 and Ryder 112 on the Act. 12See Lansbury's "Gynaecology" for an analysis of the ways in which graphic evidence of vivisection offended the Victorian public.
