<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  Chapter Ten  •  The Vitality of Idealism: Life and Evolution  in Schelling’s and Hegel’s Systems   tilottama rajan   Encyclopedics and the Life Sciences  S helley’s last poem,  The Triumph of Life, has at its core the question, “Then what  is life?,” posed by the character Shelley to Rousseau, who has returned from the  grave in the vegetable form of what seems to be an “old root” (182, 544). Although  my focus will not be Shelley, his existential question also has a scientific resonance.  The issue of what constitutes life and organization; what the difference is between  plants, animals and man; whether divergent life forms can be arranged in an ascent  of man; what role disease, degeneration, and aberration play in this model of  ascent that we find in philosophers of nature from Jean-Baptiste Robinet to the  early Schelling; as well as the question of where life begins between the organic  and inorganic: all these questions traverse and trouble the discourses of the life and  earth sciences, biology and botany, physiology, pathology, surgery and medicine,  mineralogy and geology.  These sciences, in turn, have metaphoric and analogical effects on a range of  areas including history, philosophy, and aesthetics. In this paper, I explore the  broader ramifications of the organicist projection in German Idealist and Roman- tic philosophy. For in this period, there is a profound shift toward understanding  forms of thought and culture as themselves in a process of evolution. History  becomes the model for thinking other disciplines, such as aesthetics or philosophy,  that are no longer approached transcendentally, as in Kant or the early Schelling.  Yet history as we conceive it – as development rather than a description not neces- sarily tied to a sense of time (Rudwick 53) – is itself generated by the philosophy of  nature as the place where the “temporalizing of the Chain of Being” (Lovejoy 242)  both discloses nature as having a history and submits history to being read in the  light of nature. More precisely, history in the thought-formation on which I focus  is generated through the evolution of natural history, by a disciplinary species  </page> <page sequence="2"> 240 Tilottama Rajan change, into what the Romantics called physiogony or the history of nature. Phys- iogony, as the British Coleridgean Joseph Henry Green (1791–1863) develops the  concept from Kant and Schelling, studies nature as “preface and portion of the  history of man” (V ital 103). I will return later to this unstably transferential inter- discipline of physiogony. Suffice it to say that the “history of nature,” as preface,  allegory or mirror-stage of spirit, raises many questions. These include questions  both about the figurality of paradigms of development that are naturalized by  being projected onto so-called nature, and about the possibilities and dangers that  thinking philosophy according to history and nature opens up.  I n speaking of the organicist projection, I do not have in mind a series of homol- ogies between the life sciences and other disciplines that would reduce these fields  to “the lowest common denominator” of a single type.1  Rather, I have in mind  the use of one area to supplement another with which it cannot be identified, the  use of human history to understand an opaque and resistant nature that Hegel  describes as “the Idea in the form of otherness,” the “negative of itself ”; or the  contrary recognition that what Schelling calls the “ideal sciences” of philosophy  and history must take account of their “real” counterparts as an “alien existence in  which Spirit does not find itself ” (Hegel, P hilosophy 3, 13; Schelling, O n Univer- sity 75, 115).2  Kant eschewed as fallacious these disciplinary border-crossings that  characterize post-Kantian Idealism (M etaphysical 9). But exactly because they are  figural, they open a space for questions like those raised by Schelling in his essay   Philosophical Investigations Into the Essence of Human Freedom (1809): “Does cre- ation have a final purpose at all, and, if this is so, why is it not reached immediately,  why does what is perfect not exist right from the beginning?” (66). To think these  issues, as Schelling does, through the history of nature, not as a confirmation but  as a mirror stage and primal scene of human history, is to recognize the answers  given as hypotheses. This is to say, also, that we think something analogically  through another discipline precisely to keep it in the realm of speculation, as well  as to experiment with possibilities not yet permitted in the original discipline.   Thus, my aim in exploring the impact of the life sciences on philosophy will  not be to pick a scientifically correct model such as Darwinian evolution and ask  whether thinkers from Robinet to Schelling anticipated it. Such demonstrations  do remind us that in this period before the disaggregation of disciplines, philoso- phers like Hegel, Schelling, and Schopenhauer were well-read in science, and even  trained in it: Schelling studied medicine and received awards in the field, Scho- penhauer took medicine at Göttingen, and his later book O n The Will in Nature  (1836) is an attempt to give his philosophy a grounding in the contemporary life  sciences. But Idealism does not have a single evolutionary model, and the fact  that it takes up different models is precisely what allows it to speculate analogi- cally in other areas also in a state of ferment. 3 This is to say that Idealism is just  </page> <page sequence="3"> The Vitality of Idealism 241 as worth studying when its science is “wrong” as when it is “right.” In using the  word “evolution” here, I therefore use it in a broad sense. As we see in  The First  Outline of a System of the Philosophy of Nature (1799), Schelling was well aware  of debates around preformation, epigenesis, metamorphosis, and recapitulation  (38n). But when he writes that “[a]ll evolution presupposes involution” (A ges 83),  the word does not signify a proto-Darwinian evolution – nor does he mean pre- formation, which, as Robert Richards points out, was what evolution implied at  the time ( Meaning 1–15).4  Rather, Schelling means development, but with a ques- tion about whether creative evolution and the anthropology it subtends are even  possible. My aim, then, in discussing N aturphilosophie is to treat this discipline,  in Jason Wirth’s words, as “a gateway into the original experience of philosophiz- ing.” N aturphilosophie , as the transference and counter-transference of philosophy  and the life sciences into each other, is not, or not just, a “kind of philosophy or  a topic within philosophy” (11). Nor is it a kind of naive science that Hegel and  Schopenhauer criticized while doing it themselves. Rather, it is a thought experi- ment, a “way of doing philosophy in accordance with nature,” as Wirth says (11),  in the process of which the relations between what Foucault calls the empirical  and transcendental (319–23) are completely recast. For the empirical, rather than  being determined  a priori by the transcendental, writes back to it, also radically  reconfiguring philosophy itself at a transcendental level.  I dealism is a fertile site for exploring the interdisciplinary consequences of the  philosophy of nature, because it is a systematic, if perpetually self-questioning,  program for thinking disciplines within a larger whole, a project summed up  in Hegel’s idea of an encyclopaedia of the philosophical sciences, or Schelling’s  project of introducing “Idealism ... into all the sciences” (I deas 272n). But what  does such an encyclopaedia entail, since the very concept of knowledge itself also  becomes inflected for Hegel by the question of evolution? For Kant, who gave a  course on “The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy as a Whole,” the systematic orga- nization of knowledge takes the form of an architectonic, in which “every sci- ence [has] its determinate position in the encyclopaedia of the sciences” ( Judgment  285), and in which this position and the “boundaries” of each individual science  are “determined a  priori ” by philosophy (P ure Reason 691). Kant thus conceives  disciplines as what Bruno Latour in  The Politics of Nature calls “smooth” rather  than tangled objects (22), under the governance of their “p ure”  part (Kant, M eta- physical 5). Smooth objects are ones that we grasp separately, whereas tangled  objects are reciprocally affected by other objects, and produce risks and possi- bilities for knowledge (Latour 22–3). To Kant’s goal of a smooth system we can  oppose Novalis’s unfinished N otes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia,  which gives the  name “encyclopaedics” to an interdisciplinary thinking that is not architectonic  but in which the parts have effects on the whole. Thus the “encyclopaedization”  </page> <page sequence="4"> 242 Tilottama Rajan of a discipline occurs when the parts are not just fitted into a whole but also react  upon this whole, both between and within disciplines (76). The result is a tangled  system in which the relations of parts and whole are reciprocal and lateral, not  hierarchical. Encyclopedics thus transforms individual disciplines from restricted,  professionalized “fields,” in Bourdieu’s sense (97–102), into what Bataille calls  general economies capable of reorienting the whole (19–22). The “versability” of  disciplines, their contamination by or “translation” into each other, as Antoine  Berman calls it (14), exposes disciplines to their “unthought” (Foucault 322–4),  through the recourse they often have to other disciplines from which they borrow  to understand their objects.  I nterestingly, Latour frames his distinction between smooth and tangled objects  within the issue of ecology, which for him involves a “crisis” of “objectivity” rather  than “nature” p er  se (18): a shift in how we understand material and intellectual  objects, including, for my purposes, disciplines. The term “ecology” (though also  aimed at ecocriticism’s simplifying view of “nature”) refers to considering objects  in their environment as entangled with other objects. But this epistemological  shift can itself be traced back to knowledge-systems of the long Romantic period,  which saw a transition from the smooth disciplines of physics and mathemat- ics to the tangled fields of the life and earth sciences as paradigms for how we  know. Kant’s concept of disciplines as smooth entities precedes the entanglement  of “real” and “ideal” sciences that occurs in post-Kantian Idealism (Schelling, O n  University 103-4): the reformulation of ideal sciences like philosophy, history, and  aesthetics, by real disciplines such as the life sciences. For Kant, a science may ini- tially be based on “f oreign principles (p eregrina )” which it borrows “from another  science” ( J udgment 252). But as David Ferris argues, these borrowings must be  domesticated to evolve a science no longer troubled by such foreign matter but  committed to “the reproduction,” “of itself as a discipline” (1251–2). This internal  rationalization of a discipline is what Kant understands by the term “architec- tonic,” by which he means “the art of systems,” and which he thinks in terms  of the body as a whole, into which all the parts are integrated: a structural and  aesthetic, rather than genuinely organic, use of the “body.” The architectonic of  “all human knowledge,” which Kant refers to but does not fully construct, must  similarly be a system in which all parts are integrated (P ure Reason 691–2). The  result would be what Derrida calls a whole “architecture of philosophy,” in which  “[concepts in] aesthetics, language, logic, history, metaphysics etc. are invisibly  interwoven ( Points 212), but in order to cover over the pattern of closed meta- phoric transfers that allows for “manifold cognitions” to be repressed “under one  idea” (Kant, P ure Reason 691).   The early Schelling theorizes a similar, if more mystical, architectonic in his lec- tures O n University Studies (1803), which he describes as an “outline [G rundriss ]”  </page> <page sequence="5"> The Vitality of Idealism 243 that “might take the place of a general encyclopaedia of the sciences” (41; 8:481).  But he also begins to jeopardize this outline, both by his actual attempts to work  it out in areas like speculative physics and medicine, and by the cross-disciplin- ary mirrors he uses to imagine the interconnections of knowledge. “Mirror” is  Schelling’s own figure, when he speaks of art, in the P hilosophy of Art (1803/4),  as the “magic and symbolic mirror of philosophy” (8); and Schelling experi- mented with more than one such mirror, eventually dismissing mathematics on  the grounds that Kant’s fondness for it produces a paradigm for knowledge that  favours a “crystal” over the human body because it never falls ill (“On the Nature”  212–13). The mirror of art in Schelling’s early S ystem of Transcendental Idealism  (1800) and P hilosophy of Art is not so much an awareness of the role of figure in  argument as it is aesthetics, the discipline that Baumgarten defines as the art of  thinking beautifully and by analogy.5  It is in this sense that Odo Marquard can  say that T he System “takes an aesthetic perspective on existence: it determines  philosophy primarily as aesthetics” (13). Aesthetics as mirror or supplement to  philosophy can transform history, for instance, from a real into an ideal science by  “present[ing] real events and histories ... in complete form ... so that they express  the highest Ideas” ( On University 107).  W ith such idealization in mind, in lectures on U niversity Studies Schelling uses  physiology as a disciplinary mirror, but filters it through aesthetics (141–2). Thus  he conceives the “totality” of knowledge, not as a body without organs, in Deleuze’s  phrase (44–7), but according to the aesthetically organized figure of an “organic  body ( organisches Leib) ” whose life flows from the “central organs” of mathematics  and philosophy to “the outermost parts,” which include physics and chemistry  ( On University 27, 42; 8:468, 482).6  A further epistemological analogue for this  unification is provided by comparative anatomy: the study of nature in terms of  “the unity and inner affinity of all organisms” that “originate in one archetype  whose objective aspect” changes but “whose subjective aspect is unchangeable”  (142). Disciplines, similarly, are multiple types of a single archetype; or, following  a Spinozist model, [they are] modes of one substance, namely “primordial know- ing (U rwissen )” (42; 8:482). These interlocking models – aesthetics, comparative  anatomy, physiology, Spinozist metaphysics – then allow Schelling to organize  the rest of his theoretical apparatus: the distinction between the ideal and real  sciences as types of the same, whose explosive difference is contained by the paral- lelism of the eternal and temporal planes (I deas 272); the mapping off of historical  and empirical from philosophical or “principled” knowledge (O n University 82);  and the resulting subordination of the empirical to the transcendental in absolute  knowledge.   Yet the curious thing is that both Schelling’s scientific analogues are potentially  problematic. As a figure for the assimilation of parts into a whole, physiology is  </page> <page sequence="6"> 244 Tilottama Rajan a troublesome part of Hegel’s E ncyclopaedia (1817), allowing for a part of the  body, and by extension the body of knowledge, to function at variance with the  whole. Schelling, too, takes up this deviance of the part in the  Freedom essay, in  which he writes that an “individual body part, like the eye, is only possible within  the whole of an organism,” but also has its own “life” and “freedom” which it  “proves through the disease of which it is capable” (18). Yet Schelling does not go  in this direction in the lectures O n University Studies , where he sees comparative  anatomy and physiology as “correlative disciplines” that he projects onto each  other (141). He thus contains physiological fluidity and its invisible entanglement  of systems7  within the visible smoothness of anatomical structure, making the  “external” body of actual knowledge an emanation from the “internal organism of  primordial knowledge” (76), and thus reducing the many to the one. Comparative  anatomy, with its tropes of consilience, metamorphosis, and recapitulation, is also  a highly tangled discipline, as Adrian Desmond’s account of the different ways it  was politically appropriated tells us. But here, as in Frye’s A natomy of Criticism, it  is stripped of the more textured debates around transmutationism, evolution, even  degeneration, that complicate the static model of anatomy. In short, the Schelling  of these early lectures also constructs a smooth system of knowledge whose parts  do not conceptually interfere with each other.   Hegel, too, attempts to construct a smooth system that forwards the phenom- enology of Spirit: what Derrida criticizes as an “auto-encyclopaedia of absolute  Spirit” (“Age” 148). According to Rosenkranz, during the Jena years when many  of the elements of Hegel’s Encylopaedia were first introduced, Schelling tried  to work out the critical foundations of absolute philosophy, while Hegel set to  work developing it as a “cycle of sciences” (qtd. in Vater 82). Hegel’s system is  diachronic rather than synchronic. Ideally, each discipline, though a “sphere” in  its own right, is also supposed to be a level or moment in an ascending series.  Thus, in T he Philosophy of Nature,  mechanics, physics, and “organics,” or the  life sciences, are levels in a scale of disciplines that parallels the Chain of Being;  together they form the “sphere” of the natural sciences, which is a level supposedly  surpassed by the sciences of Spirit. The encyclopaedia or cycle of learning in which  consciousness learns how to become Spirit thus becomes an ascent from matter to  Spirit through the progression from the real to the ideal sciences. This ladder of  disciplines is not unique, though the rungs may be placed differently. Coleridge,  who never completed his projected E ncyclopaedia Metropolitana , may have seen his  posthumously published T heory of Life (1816) as part of a philosophy of nature  that ascends from geology, physics, and mechanics, through zoology and physiol- ogy. Brought together, these sciences comprise “the one absolute science of Life,”  and inaugurate “a new series beyond ... physiology,” the ideal series in Schelling’s  terms, namely philosophy and theology (T heory 516, 519n;  Notebooks 4:4517).  </page> <page sequence="7"> The Vitality of Idealism 245 Coleridge also tells us that the  Opus Maximum was intended as a “compleat ...  system of Logic, Natural [Philosophy] and Theology” ( Letters 4:736), like Hegel’s   Encyclopaedia.  In M ental Dynamics (1847), Green echoes the title of his earlier   Vital Dynamics (1840) to effect a transition from nature to Spirit, as a specifically  Coleridgean transition from physiological to political “constitution.” Using the  Hunterian lectures, which were supposed to deal with the always-troublesome  life sciences, as a platform to institute the training of a clerisy, Green sketches a  disciplinary series proceeding from grammar to “natural history” to what he calls  physiogony, through civil history to mathematics and logic and, finally, philoso- phy (7–19, 41).  B ut Hegel’s system differs from Green’s in two ways. First, it is highly tangled,  as the levels double as spheres in their own right, and as the ascending structure is  complicated by its descent into proliferating microsystems that have to be recon- tained in an increasingly ramified macrosystem. Thus, “organics” is a “level” in   The Philosophy of Nature . But as a sphere in its own right, it is further divided  into the sciences of the “terrestrial,” plant, and animal organisms. Hegel studies  the animal (including the human) in terms of physiology rather than anatomy,  and physiology in turn contains the sphere of pathology, which cannot clearly  be assimilated as a level of normal physiology. The very organization of the E ncy- clopaedia in stages is the symptom of the tremendous labour of the negative that  Hegel experiences as he struggles to get difficult material under control. Culminat- ing in illness and death,  The Philosophy of Nature ’s last section on pathology risks  derailing the planned transition from nature to spirit. The result is that, though  the disciplines are arranged in a progressing series, the parts are dynamically inter- connected in the way described by Novalis, forcing us to rethink ideal sciences  such as philosophy through such subsystems as medicine and aesthetics (Rajan,  “(In)digestible Material”).  S econd, and most important for our purposes, despite figures of circles that  attempt an architectonic containment,8  Hegel’s system is profoundly temporal.  Adapting Lovejoy on the temporalizing of the Chain of Being that introduces  evolution into nature, we could describe what Hegel does as a temporalizing of  the cycle of disciplines. The result is that history and evolution become underlying  paradigms for thinking disciplines and their ideas, in terms of their historicity, as  still under development. To be sure, Hegel does not favour the word “evolution,”  either out of a certain conservatism, as J.N. Findlay says, or because he under- stood the word in an “ideal, not in a real, sense” (xv). Interestingly, he already  seems to have associated “evolution,” which at the time meant preformation, with  some kind of species change. Criticizing the concept of evolution in the sciences,  Hegel wants to restrict it to being a metaphor when he writes that it “has been  a clumsy idea in the older as well as newer philosophy of nature, to regard the  </page> <page sequence="8"> 246 Tilottama Rajan transformation and the transition from one natural form to a higher as an outward  and actual production” (qtd. in Höffding 150). But as Rüdiger Bubner says in  commenting on Schelling’s “On The Nature of Philosophy as Science,” an “evo- lutionary history” was the “model for ... Hegel’s P henomenology of Spirit ” (163).  What Schelling means by “evolution,” which in this essay he repeatedly uses in the  context of knowledge, is quite complex: “a historical explanation” to begin with,  a “living system” that is “not just a sequence of laws,” a process in which at differ- ent points opposite things can be true, and finally a certain “asystasy” or “inner  conflict” as the very core of life (215–16).   Physiogony  I n this section, I want to take up one zone of entanglement: the unstably trans- ferential inter-discipline of physiogony. Physiogony, or the history of nature, is a  supremely metaphysical conceit: a projection of anthropomorphic models onto  nature so as to find in nature a history that confirms certain postulates about  human history. This transference, the kind of fallacy Kant criticizes, is invisibly  present throughout nineteenth-century models of history. But its institution as a  discipline that actually puts itself at risk by disclosing its figural composition is  quintessentially Idealist, and is at the very core of Hegel’s P hilosophy of Nature and  its intended place in his larger organization of knowledge. For if, as Green says, the  history of nature as “preface and portion of the history of man” makes the “knowl- edge of Nature” a “branch of self-knowledge” (V ital 103), the story Nature tells  may not be the one we expect. The transference of Spirit onto Nature may well  result in the real disciplines of the natural sciences unsettling the ideal disciplines  of philosophy, history, and aesthetics.  T he curiously Hegelian interpellation of nature into the history of self- consciousness is from Joseph Henry Green’s 1828 Hunterian lecture at the Royal  College of Surgeons. For it is Green, who had studied in Germany and was well- versed in  Naturphilosophie,  who was a friend and follower of Coleridge, mentor  of the leading Victorian biologist Richard Owen (1804–92), Hunterian professor,  and then Professor of Surgery at King’s, who provides the most succinct account  of physiogony. In both his 1827 Hunterian lecture and his 1828 lecture printed in   Vital Dynamics, Green distinguishes three branches of the study of nature, which  are really approaches rather than empirical fields. The first is physiography, or  the description of nature’s products, what we generally call natural history, rather  paradoxically, since it involves an atemporal taxonomy. The second is physiology,  or the theory of nature, which is to say the powers behind nature conceived vitally  rather than mechanistically: n atura naturans rather than n atura naturata. And the  last is physiogony, which Green in 1827 imagines as “an agent acting under the  </page> <page sequence="9"> The Vitality of Idealism 247 analogy of a will and in pursuit of a purpose,” but which he describes the following  year as part of “self-knowledge” (“Introduction” 307–12;  Vital 101–3). Green gave  the Hunterian lectures from 1824 to 1828 and in 1847, and his task was to pro- vide a narrative to explain John Hunter’s cabinet of curiosities, which consisted of  various fossil and skeletal remnants: a narrative that is the basis for modern muse- ums of natural history. For Green, as for Coleridge in his T heory of Life , which  he worked on with Green, physiogony thus becomes anthropology, as the history  of nature is subsumed into a temporalized Chain of Being in which nature works  her way up from “the  polypi to the  mammalia, ” “labour[ing] in birth with man”  ( Vital 101–6). Yet as we shall see, Green’s knowledge of Schelling notwithstanding,  Schelling himself is a far more deconstructively speculative thinker.  G reen’s terms go back semantically to Kant, who, in “The Use of Teleological  Principles in Philosophy” (1788), introduces two of the terms: physiography for   Naturbeschreibung, or the “description of nature”; and Physiogony for N aturge- schichte, or what Green, via Schelling, calls the history of nature. Kant’s definitions  exhibit his usual caution and reserve. N aturbeschreibung,  more than the account of  a mere “empirical traveler,” is the “systematic” description of nature exemplified by  Linnaeus. It is really what we now know as natural history, the term Kant’s transla- tors use for N aturgeschichte (197). For natural history, as Foucault points out, was  not historical in our sense; instead, it placed the “proliferation of beings occupying  the surface of the globe ... [in] the field of a mathesis that would also be a general  science of order,” making the world codifiable “within a taxonomic area of visibil- ity” (133–7). Kant does not commit himself to the second term,  Naturgeschichte ,  glossing the word “history” as both a “narrative” and a “description” of “events in  nature [N aturbegebenheit ].” As a narrative, N aturgeschichte “trac[es] back, as far  as the analogy permits,” the connections between “present-day conditions ... and  their causes in earlier times”; it traces things back, but is in no way anticipatory.  Moreover, it works only “according to laws of efficient causality.” Since giving this  narrative a temporal depth by making it one of origins would be a “science for  gods,” Kant does not really stray from “physics” into “metaphysics” (“On the Use”  195–7), though the very setting up of such boundaries flirts with the possibility  of crossing them, especially given Kant’s dissatisfaction with being limited to what  is known from experience (P ure Reason 398), and his delimitation of physics as a  science of the mere understanding rather than Reason.  N evertheless, Kant does not want to go in the metaphysical direction of George  Forster, an essay by whom occasioned Kant’s response, and who already imagines  an “earth in labour” that generates organisms in an “unnoticeable gradation” that  can be traced back from man “down the chain of nature” (qtd. by Kant, “On  the Use” 214). Indeed, in the slightly earlier M etaphysical Foundations of Natural  Science (1786), Kant had avoided any sense of deep or future history by defining  </page> <page sequence="10"> 248 Tilottama Rajan  Naturgeschichte in the older sense of history, as “a systematic presentation of natu- ral things at various times and places” (4). Yet in the  Opus Postumum (1804), a  kind of universal brouillon, in Novalis’s phrase, and thus a work in process, Kant  seems to have read Schelling (251, 254), and Schelling’s notions of a world-soul  and an absolute organism are threaded throughout the text (66–7, 71). Indeed,  the O pus Postumum resembles nothing more than Schelling’s F irst Outline . Its  promise of a few sheets making the transition from metaphysics to physics that will  complete Kant’s system (qtd. in Förster xvi) unravels into a Coleridgean mess of  thirteen hundred pages. And similarly, Kant’s self-disciplining of his work within  the philosophy of science, as it will subsequently be known, also collapses. Physics  and metaphysics mutually unground each other, and the analytic and positivis- tic privileging of physics over metaphysics becomes a finding of “metaphysical  foundations of natural science” in “physical foundations” that threaten to break  metaphysics open ( Opus 39).  I t is this wavering between physics and metaphysics, understanding and Rea- son, that allows post-Kantians such as Coleridge to say that Kant could not have  meant to be as cautious as he was (B iographia 154–5). Here, as in his use of the  proto-Romantic term “ideas” or “Idea,” Kant, as Philip Sloan disparagingly puts  it, “provided the opening ... through which Schelling and his disciples,” such  as Oken, “could rush with enthusiasm” (27). Commenting on the difference  between Kant’s actual and potential use of the term N aturgeschichte , Schelling  notes that Kant’s  Naturgeschichte is not much different from a N aturbeschreibung .  In this sense, we might add that English translations of Kant’s  Naturgeschichte as  natural history are accidentally quite appropriate. In a kind of epigenesis of Kant’s  term  Naturgeschichte,  Schelling thus tries to give it a “much higher meaning”: that  of a “ history of nature itself [e ine Geschichte der Naturselbst] ,” in which Nature  “gradually brings forth the whole multiplicity of its products through continu- ous deviations [A bweichungen ] from a common ideal ... and so realizes the Ideal  [ das Ideal ], not indeed in the individual, but in the whole” ( First Outline 53;  68). Schelling’s desynonymization of N aturgeschichte and  die Geschichte der Natur 9   strikingly anticipates Foucault’s distinction in T he Order of Things between natural  history and the history of nature. For Foucault, as already noted, natural history  has nothing to do with temporality. Although it allows for development, it does  so by “traversing [a] preordained table of possible variations” (275) in which time  simply unfolds space. By contrast, the history of nature entails a new sense of  historicity, especially once it becomes decoupled from Enlightenment discourses  of perfectibility. Expanding on Foucault, we could say that the history of nature  evolves into an analytic of finitude when geology and biology, rather than phys- ics and even botany (a discourse of plenitude), become synecdoches for natural  science. For the geologization of time introduces memory and even trauma into  </page> <page sequence="11"> The Vitality of Idealism 249 nature. For its part, biology distinguishes animals from plants, which natural his- tory had laid out on the same taxonomical surface. Where the plant, as Foucault  says, “held sway on the frontiers of movement and immobility ... the animal main- tains its existence on the frontiers of life and death” (277). Natural history thus  unfolds within the field of logic, whereas the history of nature, though initially  the projection of a form of anthropology, exposes thought to ontology, to life and  being, through its human nature.   Yet it would not be correct to credit Kant, except perhaps in the O pus Pos- tumum , with an opening that leads to Schelling. For developmental models of  nature’s history as creative evolution leading to an increasing perfection of man  himself precede Kant, and are the subject of his critiques not only of Forster, but  also of Herder’s  Ideas for a Philosophy of the History of Mankind , which makes the  history of nature a preface and portion of the history of man. These thinkers are  constantly criticized by Kant for lack of rigour and for using imagination rather  than Reason, thus keeping the study of nature at the level of “a systematic art  rather than a science” (M etaphysical Foundations 4). Thus Kant, in his review of  Herder, comments on Herder’s assumption of an evolution from the lowest beings  to man, complaining that he (Kant) “does not understand this inference from  the analogy of nature, even if he were to concede that continuous gradation of  [Nature’s] creatures ... For they are  different beings that occupy the many stages  of the ever more perfect organizations” rather than “t he same individual .” Herd- er’s scheme, whether one describes it as palingenesis or epigenesis, is for Kant an  instance of a metaphoric sleight of hand that substitutes “hints” for “determinate  concepts,” and “force of imagination given wings whether through metaphysics or  through feelings” for “observed laws” (131–3). It would be more accurate, then, to  say that Kant did not entirely close the door he tried to close on creative evolution,  and could be read against the grain, insofar as Kant’s authority made it necessary  for his successors to find a way through him.   Indeed, the developmental models that Kant found at once seductive and  ungrounded go back well before Herder to what Arthur Lovejoy calls the “tem- poralizing of the Chain of Being” that begins with the e ncyclopédiste Jean-Baptiste  Robinet’s  de la nature (1761–8). Robinet introduces the idea of nature as evolving  through time, accompanied by the very metaphor of labour that Green will use.  Nature, he says, is “never stationary” and is “always at work, always in travail ...  fashioning new developments, new generations” (Robinet, qtd. in Lovejoy 275).  Insofar as Robinet, as Lovejoy argues (271–80), may have been the first to use the  word “prototype,” which becomes U rbild or  Ideal in Schelling, Robinet, though  a preformationist, theorizes what Schelling in  the First Outline calls a “dynamic  preformation” (37n), in which the “seeds [s emences] ” and the further “germs” they  conceal do not all develop together (Robinet [1768] 27). In the “graduated” but  </page> <page sequence="12"> 250 Tilottama Rajan still unpredictable and unfinished “sequence of beings” that ensues, nature works  with “a single model,” such that different beings are “variations” of a generative  “prototype,” “graduated a d infinitum ” (Robinet [1761] 2, 12). Robinet even ques- tions the division of the chain of being into four classes (mineral, vegetable, etc.)  that persists in nineteenth-century comparative anatomy, where the preservation  of these divisions or, alternatively, the construction of links across them analogi- cally constitutes the social spectrum of what Adrian Desmond calls “the politics  of evolution,” ranging from conservative to Dissenting appropriations of evolu- tion (1–8, 18–21). Thus, for Robinet, the “Scale of Beings” is a “whole infinitely  graduated, with no real lines of separation; ... there are only individuals, and no  kingdoms or classes or genera or species” (qtd. in Lovejoy 275). Robinet’s proto- Romantic theorizing of creative evolution as a ladder of upward mobility is affec- tively conveyed by the way he follows a pattern of ascent from the simplest to  the most complex creatures, rather than a genealogy or pattern of descent that  proceeds “from the more complex groups to a termination in the lower orders.” 10  That Robinet may not have been a good scientist is not the point. His fictions  not only provided an opening for future science, they also marked an important  shift in the deployment of nature within a pattern of metaphoric transfers that  supports an entire system of aesthetics, history, and the political. This shift allows  a structure that was “rigid and static” to become open to change; the “p lenum  formarum ,” as Lovejoy puts it, also comes to be conceived “not as the inventory of  nature” provided by natural history, “but as the program of nature, which is being  carried out gradually” (242–4). Paradoxically, this program has the effect of mak- ing nature, and perhaps humans, more imperfect than Enlightenment optimism  will concede, while also anticipating a future perfection, thus allowing us to see  both nature and the history analogically thought through it as being in a process  of evolutionary potentiality.   So, if the history of nature goes back to Robinet, and if Kant is cautioning  against such metaphysical paradigms, in what does Schelling’s theoretical original- ity consist? Or why is Idealism post-Kantian rather than pre-Kantian? There are  two related points to make here, which place Schelling beyond Kant yet distinguish  him from British post-Kantians such as Green and Coleridge. First, Schelling’s  idea that there can be a h istory of nature crosses disciplinary borders that Kant  was at pains to maintain. But this does not mean that Schelling made Kant’s  regulative ideas constitutive (the criticism often made against post-Kantian Ideal- ism); on the contrary, Schelling, unlike Robinet and Herder, is aware that reading  nature according to human ends is speculative. The difference between Kant and  Schelling is that Kant’s aim in emphasizing the dangers of going beyond analogy  when one discipline is used to supplement another is critical. Thus, if one brings  God into natural science to make “purposiveness explicable,” Kant says, and then  </page> <page sequence="13"> The Vitality of Idealism 251 in a double metaphoric transfer uses this purposiveness “to prove that there is a  God, then there is nothing of substance in either of the sciences, and a deceptive  fallacy casts each into uncertainty by letting them cross each other’s borders” ( Judg- ment 253). Schelling, however, is open to the value of analogy in concept-creation,  and makes transferences between disciplines constitutive for speculation. But this  is not the same as saying that these “Idealizations” ground the Ideas of Reason (in  Kant’s phrase) in the “archetypes of things-in-themselves” (Sloan 27).1 1 To antici- pate my further argument, the words “archetype” and “prototype,” especially when  attached to the word “Idea,” are simply ways of giving this Idea a real speculative  force, a phenomenological (not noumenal) reality that distinguishes the Idealist  Idea from that of Kant, who offers ideas, but then withdraws them as fictions.   In using encyclopedics as a speculative thought-environment rather than a  closed system, Schelling also differs from Green. Sloan, in the most detailed read- ing of Green so far, argues that Green, unlike Coleridge, remained a Kantian,  because he maintained the three branches of the study of nature as clearly distinct  enterprises, in which the reality-claim of physiogony cannot be established (28,  32–3). Thus Green writes that physiogony sees nature “as an agent acting under  the analogy of a will and in pursuit of a purpose, in what sense and whether by  a necessary fiction of Science or with some more substantial ground we leave  undetermined” (“Introduction” 307–8). But Green, I would argue, also tends to  ground the totalizing vision of his physiogony by making God the guarantor of the  unfolding archetypes. In his 1827 Hunterian lectures, in which he does allow that  physiogony may be a “fiction,” Green nevertheless uses the biological term “type”  in a distinctly typological way to forward the narrative of physiogony. The “T ypes  or characters impressed on animal bodies” form a “visual language” that Green  grounds through the trope of the “book” of Nature; “a book not indeed without  hiatus and interspaces to be filled up by future discoveries, yet no hiatus of such  magnitude or importance as to destroy or even obscure the manifest principles of  arrangement that pervades the whole” (“Introduction” 310, 312). But from the  1828 lectures to the late M ental Dynamics and the posthumous  Spiritual Philoso- phy (1865), which are concerned with the organization of knowledge for the for- mation of a clerisy, Green grows increasingly metaphysical. Green, that is, jumps  from biology into theology via aesthetics, whereas Schelling’s U rbild undergoes an  increasing complication, as the archetype associated with the neo-Platonic Ideas  in B runo (125–6), and conceived purely on the level of metaphysics, is made part  of the U ngrund or U rgrund in the F reedom essay (62), where it must necessarily be  rethought completely through the life sciences as the unconscious of spirit.  I dealism’s difference from its British appropriation is summed up by Richards,  who points out that in taking over N aturphilosophie’ s desire to conceive individual  organisms and nature itself as teleologically structured, thinkers like Green and  </page> <page sequence="14"> 252 Tilottama Rajan Owen “attributed to God the designing power through which nature came to real- ize distinctive means-ends patterns” (R omantic 518). But to remove divine guaran- tees and make the purposiveness of nature depend purely on a consilience between  aesthetic and teleological judgment also opens up questions about whether nature  is indeed teleologically structured. For if one thinks Nature as self-developing or  autogenetic, there is no guarantee of where the process will lead; indeed, such a  view of nature could also result in aesthetics itself, the substrate of teleology, being  radically rethought in accord with nature. This brings me to my s econd point,  which is that Schelling does not have a model for the history of nature that is other  than conjectural. Between 1797 and 1815, he made several overlapping attempts  to think the relation between nature and Spirit, each of which is a speculative  foray into the problem. These include a counter-Fichtean N aturphilosophie that  syncretizes philosophy and nature, Identity Philosophy as an attempt to fit ideal- ism and realism into a single system. They also include the Idealist materialism of   the First Outline, which begins to understand a certain contention or “asystasy” as  inherent within Spirit (“On the Nature” 210) when Spirit is thought as a natural  phenomenon, and which thus anticipates the darker F reedom essay and  Ages of the  World (1815).   The  First Outline is the text most complexly engaged with the natural sciences,  as well as with physiogony (rather than just physiology, like I deas for a Philosophy  of Nature) . It is possible on the basis of this text in particular to place Schelling  within the debate on evolution, arguing that he postulates a “dynamic evolution”  (Richards, M eaning 27–9). To expand on this, Schelling’s first scientifically precise  reference is actually to “dynamic preformation,” not evolution. Schelling writes  in a long footnote: “I do not yet want to evoke the general principle that no  individual preformation, but only  dynamic preformation exists in organic nature,  and that organic formation [ Bildung ] is not evolution, but the epigenesis of indi- vidual parts” (37n; 3:61n).1 2 Here, Schelling reserves the word “evolution” for  an individual preformation, in which the entire development of the individual  preexists either in the egg or sperm. He uses the term “dynamic preformation”  for a development occurring through the “graduated series” of beings in nature,  and he equates this with epigenesis, using the term somewhat incidentally. But in  the course of  the First Outline, Schelling sheds the term “preformation,” referring  repeatedly to an “evolution of nature” that is not and cannot be completed, 13 a use  of the word that is far removed from the closed systems of ovist or spermist  p reformation – though perhaps consistent with preformation as conceived by  Charles Bonnet – and a use of the word that marks an important shift in the  meaning of the word “evolution.”  A s Richards cautions, we should not equate this dynamic evolution with species  change ( Meaning 28–9). Indeed, dynamic evolution may be heterogeny rather  </page> <page sequence="15"> The Vitality of Idealism 253 than transmutation.1 4 But whether or not Schelling anticipates Darwin is irrel- evant for my purposes, as he is clear that he is using a kind of metaphor to explore  an Idea of Reason in the Kantian sense: “The assumption that different organiza- tions have really formed themselves through gradual development out of each  other, is a misunderstanding of an I dea,  that really lies in R eason ” ( First Outline  49; 3:63; translation and emphasis mine). At the level of this Idea, Schelling comes  to prefer the word “evolution” because of the continuous historical process it inti- mates, and the connotation of “o ne production captured at different stages” (39).  Schelling does not ally himself with the more technical term epigenesis, probably  because, while it may better explain how evolution occurs than does preformation,  it does not capture his sense of a larger process at work in nature.  I n short, evolution is introduced as a metaphor, though not loosely, since  Schelling was a rigorous scientist. Its collateral importance, which is felt not so  much in this text as elsewhere in the Idealist corpus, lies in the work it does in areas  that can be rethought in the light of nature: history, phenomenology or the history  of self-consciousness and its products, and, as I will suggest, aesthetics. But what  is this evolution? At first glance, Schelling seems to conceive of it as a relatively  seamless process, involving “one organism” or “product” (F irst Outline 149), just as  Robinet says that “nature is a single act” ([1761] 2). In other words, “evolution” is  Robinet’s “progression” ([1761] 5), though “inhibited at various stages” (Schelling,   First Outline 43), a crucial point to which I will return. In this model, more  fully elaborated by Coleridge in T he Theory of Life and Hegel in the P hilosophy of  Nature , life proceeds from minerals and crystals, through insects and plants by way  of aprocess of “vegetation and animalization,” up to man (Coleridge, T heory 538).  This progression is enhanced by the recapitulation of phylo- in ontogenesis, which  provides the basis for the A ufhebung so central to Idealist phenomenology: once  the “original tendencies” of the “formative drive” have been developed, Schelling  says, they become inherited without having “to develop all over again in each  single individual of the same class” (F irst Outline 46). 15 For Coleridge who, like  Schelling, concedes that the formative drive meets resistances on the way, every  “grade of ascension” is accompanied by a regression that is, however, recuper- ated at a new level of integration (T heory 548) – a formulation that sounds very  much like Hegel’s dialectic. Schelling refers to this model of a series of evolutions  achieved through recapitulation and sublation as “the graduated series of stages in  nature” ( First Outline 6). And it is the basis for the phenomenologies of spirit that  we find in his  Philosophy of Mythology and for Hegel’s accounts of the evolution of  aesthetics, philosophy, religion, history itself, and nature: phenomenologies that  exist as histories in contemporaneous thought, but that Hegel in particular gives  a philosophical cast by making history the history of the “shapes” produced by  consciousness in the process of trying to find its way to absolute knowledge.  </page> <page sequence="16"> 254 Tilottama Rajan  So the graduated series of stages in nature (or  Stufenfolge ) is the hypothesis, one  could say prototype, at the core of  the First Outline, and, in a way, the Idea that is  the very formative drive of Idealism. But is this “deduction” (7–8, 10–11) borne  out by nature? For as we have said, nothing is settled here. Despite the title F irst  Outline of a System of the Philosophy of Nature,  the text contains several competing  systems. The “Second Division” alone contains a “First System,” “Second Sys- tem” and “Third Possible System.” The whole is supplemented by an outline of  the O utline at the beginning, and an “Introduction” to the F irst Outline (1799),  published separately. In the latter, it seems Schelling wants to fit the philosophy  of nature back into the transcendental “system of knowledge,” which requires the  “real activity to be identical with the conscious or ideal” and which thus tends to  “bring back” or “subordinate the real to the ideal” (193–4). But the text’s densely  textured detail gets in the way of this intention, oddly inserted in an Introduc- tion that is belated, since the philosophy of nature conversely requires Schelling  to “explain the real by the ideal” (194). Or, as Hegel also says in frustration at the  end of the first stage of his Encyclopaedia, the “ever-increasing wealth of detail”  with which “spirit” has to contend in the philosophy of nature makes the latter  “refractory towards the unity of the Notion” (N ature 444).   Thus, the thirty propositions on the chemical process toward the end of  the  First Outline (172–84) interrupt and retard the straightforward development of  Schelling’s argument about the graduated stages of nature. These propositions,  nomadic fragments or sub-concepts each containing within itself “the principle of  its own integrity” as Shelley might say (D efence 480), do not so much make the  chemical “system” (F irst Outline 110) a key to understanding nature, as they raise  the question of how this further system might complicate the biological think- ing of nature as an “absolute organism” (54) in the process of evolution. Indeed,  throughout Schelling’s text, chemistry interferes with the disciplinarity of tran- scendental biology and zoology dominant in Green’s system. At the time, chem- istry was a “merely experimental art with no pretension to science,” as Schelling  says ( On University 132), following Kant ( Metaphysical 4–5). As the subordina- tion of chemistry to physics was reversed (O n University 131), and as it crossed  paths with vitalism, chemistry ceased to study tables of compounds and became  the study of ungraspably volatile forces, affinities, and mixtures. It thus became a  kind of double agent that unsettled the self-certainty of both physical mechanism  and organicist teleology, forcing each to think itself from the outside. There is no  question that, for Schelling, chemistry is a disturbingly paranormal science: he  is reluctant to see life as a “chemical process” because the “chemical system only  gives us effects instead of causes” ( First Outline 110), putting brakes on our ability  to know the in-itself. If chemical influences act “externally” on the organism, the  organism becomes merely “matter” or “product,” and cannot be known from the  </page> <page sequence="17"> The Vitality of Idealism 255 inside. But if they act internally (109), as a materiality that disturbs spirit’s capacity  to grasp itself from the inside, the situation is even worse. In this sense, chemistry  not only problematizes idealist biology, it is also a kind of symptom. For insofar as  chemistry is concerned with mixtures, as Michel Chaouli suggests, it is “the science  of all sciences that forever mix and again divide themselves,” with the result that  a philosophy that takes up chemistry and is inf(l)ected by it can no longer “derive  from pure, absolute principles” (208, 212–13).  T his is also to say that in t he First Outline, the model of the graduated stages  of nature, developed in idealist biology and zoology, comes under intense pressure  from other life sciences: not just chemistry, but also physics and medicine. The  very density of scientific and interdisciplinary detail in this text makes its “science”  a counter-science through which Schelling must unthink what he hypothesizes.  Counter-science is Foucault’s term for “a perpetual principle of dissatisfaction”  that “flow[s] in the opposite direction” to the established sciences, and “lead[s]  them back to their epistemological basis” (373, 379). Schelling’s own word for  this dissatisfaction that both produces and unsettles systems is a systasy . The idea  “of contemplating human knowledge within a system,” he writes, presupposes  “that it does not exist in a system, hence that it is [asystaton] – something whose  elements do not coexist, but rather something that is in inner conflict” (“On the  Nature” 210).   In concluding this section, let me therefore note two points about the gradu- ated stages of nature as “absolute product” or “absolute organism” that distinguish  Schelling’s account (F irst Outline 35, 54). First Schelling repeatedly describes the  activity of this organism as “inhibited,  retarded”  (5). The graduated stages of nature  are not straightforward, but form a negative dialectic in which Nature evolves as  “ one organism inhibited at various stages of development,” through a continual  series of “deviations from a common ideal” (43, 53). By inhibition, Schelling does  not simply mean the delimitation he discussed in the accompanying “Introduc- tion” to the  Outline, where a bounding line must be imposed on the formless if  something is to be produced. Although the word H emmung does sometimes have  this meaning of configurative limitation (42, 190), the “retarding force” (190) is  more like the tarrying with the negative that Schelling discusses at length in the  1815 A ges of the World , albeit in more ontological and even proto-psychoanalytic  terms. Here, what is expansive and outpouring is contrasted with “[s]omething  inhibiting” that “imposes itself ”: a “darkening that resists the light,” or “obliquity  that resists the straight,” or an “involution” that resists “evolution” (6, 83). Given  this resistance of the Real at the heart of nature, the graduated series of stages in  the autogenesis of nature becomes, as David Farrell Krell translates Schelling in his  seminal analysis of inhibition, a series of “botched attempts to depict the absolute”  (96; cf.  First Outline 41). And likewise with the autogenesis of Spirit as a natural  </page> <page sequence="18"> 256 Tilottama Rajan phenomenon; Spirit, too, in its incomplete form as consciousness, is involved in a  series of botched attempts at the Absolute.  B ut secondly, what happens to the products of these “ misbegotten attempts ”  ( First Outline 35)? As we know, in the theory of recapitulation, lower forms of  organization, such as insects and lizards, do not all simply disappear once they  have been sublated into the higher, but are “preserved in Nature and maintain the  rank of external ... forms” (Green, “Introduction” 310). Indeed, the nightmare of  Kafka, Hitchcock, and others is that these forms might actually be more fit to sur- vive. Schelling raises the question of what happens to the inhibited product after  its “diremption” (F irst Outline 39) as a philosophical question about the individual  entity vs. the universal will. He asks how “this inhibition could be  permanent ,” as  if perhaps it ought to be – how these “natures which have torn themselves away  from universal Nature ... can maintain an individual existence, since all of Nature’s  activity is directed towards an a bsolute organism.” His answer is that “ the individ- ual nature”  cannot “ hold its own against the universal organism”  (53–4). “Nature,”  as a certain ruthlessness of the Idealist vision of Spirit’s evolution, the unmasking  of which as a will-to-power forms the symptomatic core of Schopenhauer’s  The  World as Will and Representation (1818), assimilates those resistant entities that  stand in its way. Earlier, Schelling had noted that “all p ermanence only occurs in  Nature as o bject,  while the activity of Nature as subject continues irresistibly” (17).  If Nature as “subject” is at times the trope for, or personification of, what Schopen- hauer calls will, what happens to Nature as object, and the counter-memory that  it poses to the narrative of sublation?  T he pressure of this question and its implications for consciousness as a “series  of evolutions” (Green, “Introduction to the Natural History” 314) are displaced  to a later section on disease. Insofar as “deviation ... is intolerable” at the level  of the “whole,” and insofar as disease is one name for this deviation, this section  provides a different “perspective” from that of the narrative of sublation, namely  that of the “organic individual,” who is a “l imit to [Nature’s] activity, which  Nature labours to destroy” (F irst Outline 159, 41). The discussion of disease is  curiously “recovered [ nachgeholt ]” as an Appendix to the “third possible system,”  which is John Brown’s theory of “excitability” as the cause of life (158; 220) –  third “possible” system, since Schelling is not sure whether Brown’s system, as a  mediation between the “chemical system” and the “system of vital force” (68),  forwards or problematizes the graduated stages of nature. Brown (1735–88)  was much taken up in Germany, though with reservations; Schelling, Novalis,  and Hegel all wanted to go beyond his empiricism. But was this “empiricism”  a deficiency, or did it mark a limit to knowledge, keeping medicine at the level  of an “art” (66n), a figural and therefore speculative discipline? If Brown does  not finally provide the “third” system, is this simply because of a failure in  </page> <page sequence="19"> The Vitality of Idealism 257 “execution” (111n), or is the way Idealism tarries with empiricism symptomatic  of Idealism’s own unthought?  B riefly, Brown classified diseases into sthenic or asthenic, according to whether  they arose from an excess or deficiency of excitability. He did not actually use the  words “sensibility” and “irritability” sometimes attributed to him. These terms  derive from Haller and then Kielmeyer, and become associated with a third term,  Blumenbach’s force of reproduction (B ildungstrieb ), the three together making up  Brown’s “excitability.” But what makes Brown unique, as Krell suggests (48–50), is  his sense that disease is caused by “the same factors as life” itself (F irst Outline 160).  Thus, for Schelling, the “concept of disease” as “the concept of a deviation from  a rule ... or proportion” is relative: every “sickness is only a disease in relation to  this determinate organism”(159, 159n). Romantic art, for instance, was thought  deficient by Goethe and others in terms of classical “health” (Eckermann 154),  but might be its own form of aesthetic life. If the normal and pathological are part  of a continuum, deviations from the “common ideal” (F irst Outline 53) cannot  simply be left behind. Every stage of the evolutionary process must have its own  validity, and may indeed make us rethink evolution as a process of division and  multiplication in which Nature actually “organizes to infinity,” forming spheres in  which “other spheres are again formed” (43–4).  A lthough the Appendix focuses on the individual, in taking up Brown,  Schelling goes well beyond thinking the “principles” behind Brown’s empiricism  (66n), applying the part to the whole according to Novalis’s principle of encyclo- pedics. Brown’s E lements of Medicine (1780) was a chemistry of the body oriented  to treating nervous illness, and is limited to human physiology. Schelling, however,  extends Brown’s system into the general economy of “physiology,” as the term is  understood in N aturphilosophie as the study of forces operative in Nature as a  whole, where it disturbs the ascensionist biological narrative of Romantic physi- ogony with a more volatile – and empirical, rather than idealistic – chemistry. More  specifically, Schelling combines Brown with Haller, Blumenbach, and Kielmeyer,  in order to analyse “the synthetic concept of excitability” (160) into “individual  systems of s pecialized excitability”  that make “organization” an “infinite involution”  of “system within system” that puts  evolution under erasure (127). For Schelling,  the detailed study of nature discloses an entanglement of systems produced by  the “various o rgans of the same individual” and “the diversity of organisms them- selves,” along with the diversity of forces they implied (142).   Trying to reunify these systems, Schelling postulates a “gradation of forces”  subsumed into “ one force,” so as to posit a “ unity of FORCE of production  throughout ... nature,” that results in only “ one product” (141, 149). This one  force is excitability. And yet excitability is far too volatile a force to guarantee a  narrative of creative evolution. Excitability is essentially an (im)balance among  </page> <page sequence="20"> 258 Tilottama Rajan sensibility, irritability, and reproduction. The “determinate proportion” momen- tarily established among these forces results in a product, but the constitution of  this product upon an imbalance – for instance, irritability in the polyp – results  in an attempt to find a balance in another product. Yet once this balance is  found, insofar as excitability is the “organic activity” that prevents life from being  “exhausted ... in its product” (159–60), this balance seems itself to become an  imbalance that requires a further product. In the end, it is hardly possible to  disentangle disease and life. And Schelling says as much when he concedes that  disease is not “an unnatural state,” or, alternatively, that life itself is unnatural,  “extorted from Nature ... a state enduring against Nature’s will ... a perduring  sickness” (160n).   Aesthetics  I f life’s very vitality is a sickness at odds with evolution, or, alternatively if evolu- tion is actually based on that vitality, what does this mean for the products of  consciousness, insofar as the history of nature that Schelling explores in T he First  Outline is part of our self-knowledge? I want to suggest, then, that it is the ques- tions raised by a smooth evolutionary narrative, the resistances of evolution as it  were, that are the most important contribution of physiogony as developed by  Schelling. These resistances, from the viewpoint of speculative Idealism, cannot  just be “convert[ed]” into “willing subjection,” as Green says in admitting “the  resistance of a contrariant subject” “throughout ... Nature” that troubles his physi- ogony (V ital 54). They radically reorient that key term in Idealism, Idea. For in  Schelling’s F reedom essay, the Idea, which is conceived neo-Platonically in his early   Bruno and protected within “archetypal” as opposed to “productive” nature (125– 6), is relocated to the “anarchy” of the U ngrund – a “being  before all ground” (29,  68) – where it is reconfigured through the life sciences that are the unconscious  of Spirit. These resistances also produce new models of mind, in which thinking  Spirit according to nature lays the ground for psychoanalysis (Rajan, “Abyss”).  And they generate new ways of approaching art.  I n conclusion, I want to touch on the last of these areas, the history of art  that breaks open the very notion that the principles of aesthetics can be con- ceived a priori and from a transcendental point of view. In Schelling’s early   System, aesthetics, in Baumgarten’s sense of thinking beautifully, underpins a  vision of how nature unfolds autotelically in accord with Spirit. But, as we have  seen, Robinet also uses the metaphor of nature as artist, in a way that associates  art with the unfinished. For Robinet, the series of beings consists of “variations”  on an original prototype that, together, comprise Nature’s “apprenticeship in  learning to make man” through a series of “imperfect sketches” ([1761] 4)  </page> <page sequence="21"> The Vitality of Idealism 259 that Schelling calls “misbegotten attempts” at the absolute (F irst Outline 35).  Although Robinet introduces this metaphor only in passing, his deployment  of the figure of nature as artist intimates what will become a paradigm shift  from using aesthetics as a way of grounding nature to rethinking art itself in  accordance with nature, and with a history that has itself been reconfigured by  nature. Here I will turn briefly to Hegel, since if Schelling theorizes evolution,  it is Hegel who makes history, and thus the resistances of evolution, the very  medium of his thought.  F or Hegel, art is supposed to be the “adequate embodiment of the Idea” (A es- thetics 1:77), a word ubiquitous in Romanticism, used by Kant, but singularized  by Hegel so as to give it a certain drive, and also curiously unreferred, since  Hegel’s Idea is not the Idea “of ” anything. As a concept in Logic, the Idea is  “reason identical to itself.” But in Hegel’s auto-encyclopaedia of disciplines, or  the apprenticeship of consciousness in learning to become Spirit, Logic is only  the opening proposition. Logic is “the science of the idea in and for itself.” But  Logic is followed by a phenomenology that has two divisions: the Philosophy  of Nature, or “the idea in its otherness”; and the Philosophy of Spirit, or “the  science of the idea as it returns to itself from its otherness” (E ncyclopaedia 54).  This schema seems to promise an evolution from nature to Spirit, in which  nature provides the phylogenetic preface to the ontogenesis of Spirit. But in  practice, the Philosophy of Spirit contains specialized systems of evolution that  are not held together by the guarantee of recapitulation that allows one form  of consciousness to build on another, so that the Idea must keep going through  the same struggle to become identical to itself, only to begin again in a new  discipline. The prototype for this process has already been provided by T he Phe- nomenology of Spirit (1807): a narrative of the “Calvary” of Spirit that proceeds  through several “existential shape[s]” of a consciousness that is never fully raised  into Spirit (492–3).   These disciplines in which the Idea keeps beginning again include the phi- losophy of nature, its subsystems of animal physiology and pathology, the phi- losophy of history, and the history of philosophy itself, all of which develop  rhizomatically metamorphic connections that unsettle their arrangement in  a scale or ladder. One of these disciplines is aesthetics, expanded outside the  envelope of the three-volume  Encyclopedia as a specialized subsystem in which  art must pass through a long history in which it fails adequately to embody  the Idea, and indeed finds its  raison d’être in this failure. Briefly, Hegel posits  three shapes of art – Symbolic, Classical and Romantic – that involve different  relations between “inwardness” and its “externalization,” or the “idea” and its  “embodiment.” Or one could speak of three species or genera of art, since the  word G attung does double service in both aesthetics and biology. In the earliest  </page> <page sequence="22"> 260 Tilottama Rajan or Symbolic phase, represented by the oriental, art fails to achieve identity with  itself because of a deficiency in self-consciousness that results in the Idea still  being “indeterminate.” This problem is overcome in the Classical phase, as art  becomes “the adequate embodiment of the Idea” in plastic form. But in the  Romantic phase, form and content are once again separated, this time because  of a deficiency in matter that repeats and reverses the problems of the symbolic,  “even if in a higher way,” since external forms have now become insufficient to  present an idea that is now fully developed ( Aesthetics 1:77–81). Theoretically,  the schema as a whole proceeds according to the graduated stages characteristic  of the Idealists – even Schopenhauer, who bitterly unmasks Hegel’s metaphysi- cal conceit in presenting the graduated series of beings and forces in nature not  as an attempt at the adequate embodiment of the Idea, but as the “adequate  objectivity of the will” (W orld as Will 2:371). Hegel’s narrative, moreover, seems  organized by a kind of dialectical embryology described by Coleridge in h is  account of the graduated stages of nature, where he writes that “the Vita uterina”  of higher forms is found in the lower, which “present problems that first find  their solution in a superior order.” “Parts are seen, the ... full purpose” of which  is “realized higher up in the scale,” so that the higher finds its “history” in the  lower (S horter Works 2:1194). Thus, the Classical claims to be the solution of the  Symbolic, while the Romantic finds its history in the Symbolic.   Yet, as I have argued before, the A esthetics has the form of a skewed dialectic  in which the synthesis comes in the middle (“Toward” 53–4). For Classical art  resolves “the double defect” of the Symbolic, and achieves “the completed Ideal.”  It is what “true art is in its essential nature” (A esthetics 1:76, 427). The Symbolic  artist had been bound by the materiality of a thought that was not yet Concept,  and by the limitations of material forms that prevented him from grasping the  Idea, whereas the Classical artist, we are told, is a “clear-headed man.” Yet Hegel  finds this very adequacy inadequate. For one thing, the Classical artist receives his  content “already determined for imagination” from “national faith and myth,”  and his clarity comes from the fact that he now needs to work only on the “exter- nal artistic appearance” (1:438–9). By contrast, there is something more vital in  Symbolic art, which “tosses about in a thousand forms,” as part of the labour of  the negative in which consciousness is still “producing its content and making it  clear to itself ” (1:438). Hegel thus finds himself drawn back to the dissonance and  opposition of the Symbolic. He returns to it, admittedly, in the higher form of the  Romantic, which is Christian and spiritual rather than pagan and uncouth. But  one cannot but suspect that the Romantic is an alibi for revisiting the profoundly  generative matrix of the Symbolic. Or, if nothing else, it brings back the “problem”  of the Symbolic, making the Classical, which resolved Symbolic deficiency, a prob- lem of its own. But then the Romantic too proves inadequate, and is abandoned  </page> <page sequence="23"> The Vitality of Idealism 261 in the sequence of forms for philosophy. And philosophy, too, fails to find its  adequate form in Hegel’s H istory of Philosophy , which paradoxically ends with  Schelling, of whom Hegel’s major complaints are that he thinks philosophy as art,  and that he keeps beginning “again from the beginning” because his philosophy is  “in process of evolution” (3:515, 542).  H egel does not use the terms of  Naturphilosophie in the  Aesthetics,  but in the   Philosophy of Nature he does put the constructive or artistic instinct in contigu- ity with the biological processes of excretion and the reproduction of the spe- cies (406–9). This conjunction allows us to think art as part of “life” rather than  “mind”: for Coleridge, “Mind” can be “logically defined” as a “Subject possess- ing its Object in itself,” whereas “life,” in his bio-philosophical rendition, is  “a Subject” that “produce[s] an Object” in order “to f ind itself ” (S horter Works  2:1426–7). The displaced and occluded connections between N aturphilosophie  and aesthetics are the subject of another paper. But let me suggest three areas  in which these connections can be pursued. First, as a graduated series of forms  arranged in stages to articulate their differences, the history of art is not a narra- tive of creative evolution, since it cannot keep the form of a dialectical spiral; it is  not a narrative of increasing complexity and integration, as in Herbert Spencer’s  theory, adapted from the Coleridgeans. Rather, it is, albeit in disavowed form, a  dynamic evolution mobilized by an excitability, a restlessness of the negative that  produces a series of dis-integrations. The sequence of forms can thus be thought  in terms of Schelling’s sense in t he First Outline that a product occurs through the  momentary fixing of a proportion of forces, in the form of an imbalance that seeks  for balance. Thus, the “restless fermentation” of Symbolic art (A esthetics 1:438)  evinces a hyper-irritability, which calls for the balance achieved by the Classical.  But then, since excitability is what prevents life from being “exhausted in its prod- uct” (Schelling,  First Outline 160), the Classical gives way to the Romantic, which  involves a disproportion of sensibility; and so on.  S econd, Schelling, as we recall, had raised the question of how the individual  being can survive against universal nature. And Schopenhauer demystifies the  graduated stages of nature in Idealist physiogony as an objectification of the will  in which “a higher Idea,” he says, subdues the “lower ones through o verwhelming  assimilation ,” even as these lower ideas struggle to survive (W orld as Will 1:129,  134–5, 149, 153–4). Schelling also recognizes that he cannot deduce a sequence  of graduated stages without the survival of precisely those products that have  been surpassed. If these products are needed as an included exclusion to affirm  the superiority of the higher, then they must somehow be fit to survive – an  aporia Schelling does not resolve. But if we concede that Idealist history is a  kind of will-to-power, the history of art in Hegel is also a kind of memory. For  unlike Schelling, who confines the inhibition of the absolute organism to an  </page> <page sequence="24"> 262 Tilottama Rajan Appendix, Hegel tarries with the negative, and specifically with the Symbolic  as a form of inhibition. In the P henomenology, he speaks of this tarrying: “the   length of the path has to be endured,” he writes, “because, for one thing, each  moment is necessary; and further, each moment has to be  lingered over, because  each is itself a complete individual shape” (17). And at the end, Hegel gives the  name  history to the “preservation” of the shapes that Schelling’s “Nature” assimi- lates, as he describes how history “presents a slow-moving succession of Spirits,  a gallery of images, each of which, endowed with all the riches of Spirit, moves  thus slowly just because the self has to penetrate and digest this entire wealth of  its substance” (492–3). Given the enormous length of the A esthetics,  the levels  in the graduated stages do, in fact, become spheres in their own right. Indeed,  in the history of aesthetics after Hegel, a discipline that he took in a differ- ent direction from Kant and Baumgarten, thinkers such as Wilhelm Worringer  and Alois Riegl adapted the phenomenological method to develop Egyptian  art, a level in the  Aesthetics , as a sphere in its own right (Rajan, “Towards” 61).  Schelling recognizes the possibility of this epigenesis when he describes Nature,  which is seen as assimilating difference, as also “organiz[ing] to infinity,” so  that a “determinate sphere of formation” (Symbolic art for instance), far from  stagnating or simply being left behind, will again form “other spheres” within  itself ( First Outline 44).  A nd finally, this history that is Hegel’s major contribution to aesthetics gives a  place to art forms that he must judge “defective” in terms of his own claim that  “the highest” art unites “Idea and presentation” (A esthetics 1:79, 74). Yet Hegel  also refuses to call this art “unsuccessful,” since “the specific shape which every  content of the Idea gives to itself in the particular forms of art is always adequate  to that content” (1:300). More specifically, through the Symbolic, Hegel makes  a space for the principle of inhibition in art, not as delimitation, but as involu- tion, distortion, disfiguration. In other work, I have explored how the category of  Symbolic art can be used to think forms such as the Gothic that begin to emerge  as legitimate forms of art in the Romantic period, even though they violate – in  quite different ways from the Kantian sublime – the canons of aesthetics as the art  of thinking beautifully and completely (Rajan, “Work of the Negative”). H istory,  for Hegel, is what slows down the narratives of sublation he constructs for Nature  and Spirit, which assimilate the difference figured in the Symbolic.   But history is a complex notion. In one sense, the granting of autonomy to  the individual existence develops from an earlier  natural history that constructs  categories for different forms without narrativizing them. For natural history as  the collection of specimens and a systematizing of the older form of the cabinet of  curiosities cultivates a curiosity about other forms, as Green recognizes in making  it part of his trivium in  Mental Dynamics (19). In other words, the principles of  </page> <page sequence="25"> The Vitality of Idealism 263 natural history remain as a resistance within physiogony’s desire to channel the  gallery of forms into an evolution, and are a point at which the philosophy of  nature inhibits what philosophy wants to do with art history. But, in a sense, it is  precisely this evolutionary history that Idealism projects in physiogony that is also  the basis for thinking deviation in terms of its potentiality, and inhibition in terms  of problems of mediation. For Hegel’s viewing of the lower from the perspective of  the “higher” is not simply a way of dismissing the “lower.” Indeed, the Romantic  is not higher, since it is less perfect than the Classical. Instead, Hegel’s schema is a  structure for reading forms through something beyond them, something that they  have not yet achieved, which both makes them less adequate and, in the case of the  Symbolic and Romantic, orients them to the future.   Thus, Hegel sees forms of consciousness as developing, separating them into  cultural stages as a heuristic tool for seeing art as historically generated. Rec- ognizing these forms as still in process, he makes them sites for a labour of the  negative in which the Idea is still trying to know itself – a labour from which he  cannot free the “higher.” So what is this “Idea”? For the purposes of logic Hegel  defines it as “Reason identical to itself.” But in his phenomenologies, the Idea is  nothing but the drive to be the Idea: the drive that links the residual, dominant,  and emergent in a process in which balance or synthesis is no more than the  equally limited antithesis of inadequacy. In Schelling, too, the Idea is exposed  to its de-generation as an adequate concept and a concept of adequacy. In the  early  Bruno, it is conceived neo-Platonically, and protected within “archetypal”  as opposed to “productive” nature (125–6). But in the F reedom essay, Schelling  relocates it in the ground, as a result of which it is no longer a fixed “model” or  “type,” but is in “ceaseless change” and production (B runo 125, 134). He talks  of an “Idea hidden in the divided ground” and of a “blind will” that “has not yet  been raised to ... unity with the light” (F reedom 31–2). Using the terms Scho- penhauer takes over,  Wille and  Vorstellung,  but more idealistically, Schelling con- ceives the Idea as the will’s “inner, reflexive representation”: the “first stirring” in  which God “is realized, although only in himself ” (30). Or, to adapt Habermas  in his essay “Ernst Bloch: A Marxist Schelling,” the Idea is “something not yet  made good [that] pushes its essence forward” (71). Approaching art’s inability  adequately to embody the Idea, Hegel thus recovers inhibition and “defective- ness” as potentiality, through the process that Novalis calls “romanticizing,”  which finds a higher potency in the lower (Krell 46–7). The fuller theorizing  of this intuition was, in Hegel’s time, still part of an unfinished evolution that  allows us to say of the very discipline of aesthetics what Coleridge says of natural  forms: namely, that in Hegel, “parts” or possibilities emerge, the full purpose of  which, if it is not “realized higher up in the scale,” is thought through later in  the process.  </page> <page sequence="26"> 264 Tilottama Rajan  NOTES     The author acknowledges the support of the Canada Research Chairs Program and  the Centre for Advanced Studies at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich in  preparing this article.    1   This is Robert Richards’s criticism of Richard Owen’s use of the concepts of  homology and archetype in  The Romantic Conception of Life 516–17.    2   Most of Hegel’s “texts,” including the A esthetics , were not published in his lifetime,  and are based on his lectures, edited by his students. While a bullet-form version  of  The Philosophy of Nature was part of the published E ncyclopaedia , the longer text  we have, published by K.F. Michelet (1842), is an eclectic text including  Zusätze  from the early Jena lectures to the late Berlin ones (1805–30). On the text, see J.N.  Findlay’s Foreword to the text (v-ix). While there is a similar problem of publication  with much of Schelling’s work, O n University Studies and  The First Outline , though  lectures, were published by Schelling. T he Philosophy of Art was not.    3   As Bernard Bosanquet notes, the generation of Hegel and Schelling “was pregnant  with the theory of evolution,” not in the sense that they “anticipated Darwin” (a  myopically contemporary use of the term “evolution”), but as this theory existed in  various different forms in the work of “Buffon, Goethe, Erasmus Darwin, Treviranus,  and Lamarck” (196–7).    4   An example of Schelling’s use of evolution to mean preformation occurs in  the First  Outline : “the metamorphosis of insects does not occur by virtue of the  mere evolution  of already preformed parts” (38n; cf. also 47n).    5   According to Baumgarten’s A esthetica , “Aesthetics (theory of the liberal arts, inferior  cognition, art of beautiful thinking, art of reasoning by analogy) is the science  of sensitive cognition [A esthetica ( theorialiberalumartium, gnoseologia inferior,  arspulchrecogitandi, arsanalogirationis )  estscienciacognitionissensitivae ]” (qtd. in Wenzel 6).    6   When the German text has been cited, references to Schelling’s A usgewählte Werke are  given by page and volume number after the semicolon.    7   On this point, see F irst Outline 110, 122, 126–7 and “On the Nature” 212–13.    8   Hegel describes the whole  Encyclopaedia as a “circle of circles” (E ncyclopaedia #6, 51).    9   Green is also frustrated by the term “natural h istory, ” describing it in his 1827  Hunterian lectures as a “misnomer, an erratum in the nomenclature of Science”  (“Introduction” 312).   10   The distinction is made by Sloan, who notes that descent was the more common  method of exposition in early nineteenth-century comparative anatomy in Britain or  on the Continent, except for Lamarck and Green, who drew on Lamarck (34–5).   11   What Sloan calls the “Schelling revision” gives the Idea(s) a “realist” rather than  “regulative” status (33).  </page> <page sequence="27"> The Vitality of Idealism 265  12   Schelling writes: “I do not yet want to evoke the general principle that no individual  preformation, but only d ynamic preformation exists in organic nature, and that  organic formation [ Bildung ] is not evolution, but the epigenesis of individual parts.”  And further on, having talked about the metamorphosis of insects, he adds that  it “does not occur by virtue of the mere evolution of already preformed parts, but  through actual epigenesis and total transformation” (38–9n; 46–7n).   13   Schelling uses the word “evolution” throughout  the First Outline , but initially in a  general way (11, 16, 18, 21n). He uses the words “preformation” and “epigenesist”  only twice, in footnotes. When “evolution” is used  after these footnotes, it is with the  greater specificity given by his discussion of the graduated series of stages in nature,  and sometimes in conjunction with “involution” (77, 187, 188).   14   Rupke distinguishes three theories of the origin of species: transmutation, or the  gradual change of one species into another due to environmental pressures; autogeny,  or spontaneous generation from primordial germs; and heterogeny, “by many of its  advocates combined with a limited degree of autogeny, whereby lower species were  thought to have originated spontaneously but higher ones by major mutations of  embryonal and other germs” (147).   15   Richards locates the explicit introduction of recapitulation theory slightly later than   the First Outline , in the work of Schelling’s student Friedrich Tiedemann ( Zoologie  1808–14), and in Karl von Baer’s E ntwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere (1828). He traces  the beginnings of the theory to Karl Friedrich Kielmeyer’s “Ueber der Verhältnisse  der organischen Kräfteuntereinander in der Reihe der verschiedenen Organisation”  (1793) (Richards,  Meaning 19–20, 42–8). In T he Romantic Conception of Life  (244–6), Richards makes a bolder claim for Kielmeyer.   WORKS CITED   Bataille, Georges.
