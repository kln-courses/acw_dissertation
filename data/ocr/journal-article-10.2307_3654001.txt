<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "Figure" of God and the Limits to Liberalism: A Rereading of Locke's Essay and Two Treatises Vivienne Brown I. A current interpretative issue in reading John Locke's texts is the rela- tionship between Locke's theology and political philosophy.' Reacting against the secular interpretations of C. B. Macpherson and Leo Strauss, John Dunn argued that Locke's theology was axiomatic for the political philosophy of the Two Treatises of Government in that Locke's liberalism was based on a reli- gious individualism.2 Dunn thus decisively reoriented Lockean scholarship away from seeing Locke as an apologist for a new capitalist economic order, and James Tully and Richard Ashcraft have since substantiated the view that theo- logical presuppositions were foundational for Locke's political writings but they emphasized the radical nature of Locke's political position.3 This view has in turn been challenged by more recent contextual studies of the development of Locke's thought. John Marshall has argued that the political argument in the Two Treatises of Government is not dependent on religious individualism in I would like to thank Michael Ayers, Susan Khin Zaw, and Gordon Schochet for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Harris argues therefore that there is a con- tinuity of substantive thought such that theological concerns mesh into, rather than exclusively determine, the broader pattern of Locke's political and moral ideas.5 Recent studies thus share a considerable common ground in their recog- nition of the importance of the relationship between Locke's theology and political philosophy, but disagreements remain over the precise nature of this relationship and its implications for Locke's writings. This paper will address the question of the relationship between Locke's theology and political philosophy by examining the figurative expressions by means of which God is represented in Locke's Essay Concerning Human Un- derstanding and Two Treatises of Government.6 The paper will argue that the ways in which this metaphorical "figure" of God is inscribed in Locke's episte- mology and political philosophy7 suggest a different approach to reading the intricate relationship between God and mankind, and that this casts doubt on the widely-received understanding of Locke's contribution to classic liberal arguments within political philosophy. It will be argued further that the differ- ent formulations of the figure of God in these two texts result in problematizing the historiographic notions of theoretical determination and historicized autho- rial intent which have so far largely informed the interpretative debate in this area.8 4 John Marshall, John Locke: Resistance, Religion and Responsibility (Cambridge, 1994).

In the Essay it is argued that mankind has no knowledge of real es- sences, even of such a simple thing as a pebble or a fly, and certainly cannot know the real essence of God which is immeasurably more inaccessible.9 De- scriptions of God in the Essay are not, therefore, literal statements of God's characteristics but necessarily inadequate attempts to conceptualize him from within the linguistic and mental constraints of the finite world of men. Two possibilities are available to mankind in its attempt to mediate this fundamen- tal state of ignorance. One is to try to form a complex idea made up of the simple ideas received from sensation or reflection upon itself and then to mag- nify this to an infinite degree: And even the most advanced Notion we have of God, is but attributing the same simple Ideas which we have got from Reflection on what we find in our selves, and which we conceive to have more Perfection in them, than would be in their absence, attributing, I say, those simple Ideas to him in an unlimited degree.'0 God's postulated qualities are thus valued human qualities writ infinitely large, even though elsewhere the anthropomorphism of the "ignorant and uninstructed" is rejected:" [H]aving from what we experiment in our selves, got the Ideas of Ex- istence and Duration; of Knowledge and Power; of Pleasure and Hap- piness; and of several other Qualities and Powers, which it is better to have, than to be without; when we would frame an Idea the most suit- able we can to the supreme Being, we enlarge every one of these with our Idea of Infinity; and so putting them together, make our complex Idea of God.'2 In this manner mankind attempts to construct an idea of God as absolute: he is, for example, the Almighty;'3 the eternal, supreme, infinite, wise, powerful, and three genres," Philosophy and Rhetoric, 28 (1995), 276-99; and "Dialogism, the Gaze, and the Emergence of Economic Discourse," New Literary History, 28 (1997), 697-710. 9 Essay, II.xxiii.35. 10 Essay, III.vi.1.

God is simply incomprehensible.'6 In this radical state of ignorance men "frame the best Idea of him our Minds are capable of,"'7 but inevitably these complex ideas of God based on valued aspects of human life include figurative represen- tations deployed to fill the void in man's understanding. God's infinity is pos- tulated primarily in terms of his duration and ubiquity but also, "more figura- tively," with respect to his power, wisdom and goodness: That the Great GOD, of whom, and from whom are all things, is in- comprehensibly Infinite: but yet, when we apply to that first and su- preme Being, our Idea of Infinite, in our weak and narrow Thoughts, we do it primarily in respect of his Duration and Ubiquity; and, I think, more figuratively to his Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, and other At- tributes, which are properly inexhaustible and incomprehensible ... I do not pretend to say how these Attributes are in GOD, who is infi- nitely beyond the reach of our narrow Capacities: They do, without doubt, contain in them all possible perfection: but this, I say, is our way of conceiving them, and these our Ideas of their Infinity. 8 This is man's "way of conceiving" God's attributes, but the idea of something infinite, on which this idea of God is based, is "absurd," "obscure," "confused," "inconsistent," "imperfect," and "incomplete."'9 In spite of these difficulties, however, man inevitably does attempt to form an idea of an infinite and eternal God in this way, confused and incomprehensible though it is: 14 Essay, I.iv.10; II.xiv.31; II.xv.3; II.xvii.1,17,20; II.xxiii.33-35; III.vi.11-12; IV.iii.6,18; IV.x.passim. 15 Essay, I.iv.12,21; II.xiii.18,22; II.xv.3,12; II.xvii.1,20; II.xviii.20; II.xxiii.13; II.xxvii.2,13; II.xxviii.8; II.xxxii.14; III.vi.9,11; IV.x.passim; IV.xi.12; IV.xvii.4; IV.xviii.ll. 16 Essay, II.i.15; II.xiii.18; II.xv.8; II.xvii.l; II.xxiii.33. 7 Essay, II.xxiii.34. 18 Essay, II.xvii.l. 19 Essay, II.xvii.7-16; II.xxix. 15-16.

See Vivienne Brown, "On Theological Discourse in Locke's Essay," The Locke Newsletter, 29 (1998), forthcoming. Colie, "Essayist," 255-56, argues that Locke's awkward prose style at II.xvii.13 is indicative of his intellectual difficulties with the idea of infinity. On infinity cf. G. A. J. Rogers, "Innate ideas and the infinite: the case of Locke and Descartes," in Locke's Enlightenment: Aspects of the Origin, Nature and Impact of his Philosophy (Hildesheim, 1998), 49-60. 86</page><page sequence="5">Locke's Theology and Political Philosophy I think it unavoidable for every considering rational Creature, that will but examine his own, or any other Existence, to have the Notion of an eternal wise Being, who had no beginning: And such an Idea of infi- nite Duration, I am sure I have. But this Negation of a Beginning, being but the Negation of a positive thing, scarce gives me a positive Idea of Infinity; which whenever I endeavour to extend my Thoughts to, I confess my self at a loss, and find I cannot attain any clear com- prehension of it.20 Describing God in this way, flawed though it is, is simply doing "the best we can" to represent God.21 The other way in which mankind attempts to mediate its fundamental state of ignorance about God is to represent the relation between God and man by means of a series of "relative terms" because "the Ideas which relative Words stand for, are often clearer, and more distinct, than of those Substances to which they do belong."22 These relative terms are also figurative, however, based on man's own relations and his understanding of them as such. Hence God is depicted on occasion by a number of correlative and relational terms23 which represent the complex relation between God and man where "man" as well as "God" is a complex idea with an unknowable essence or archetype. Occasion- ally, either natural or instituted relations between men are used figuratively in representing the relation between God and mankind. "Natural relations" are those reciprocal relations between men based on the circumstances of origin or beginning which are given unalterably as a fact of existence; an example pro- vided is the relation of father and son.24 "Instituted or voluntary relations" are those reciprocal relations between men which depend on their wills or agree- ment in society and so, unlike natural relations, are not fixed but alterable; an example provided of this relation is that of a general and an army, in which the general has the power to command and the army is obliged to obey.25 Accord- ingly, sometimes God is described as a father, a judge or a lawmaker.26 This is 20 Essay, II.xvii.17. 21 Essay, II.xxiii.35.

Such rela- tions between men provide a vocabulary for figuratively conceptualizing the relation between God and mankind which is itselfsui generis and not reducible to such relations between men.27 The overriding set of relative terms used to represent God in the Essay, however, is that denominated in terms of cause and effect. A cause is that "which makes any other thing, either simple Idea, Substance, or Mode, begin to be" and an effect is that "which had its Beginning from some other thing." This general definition of cause and effect includes two variants, viz., "creation," where "the thing is wholly made new, so that no part thereof did ever exist before," and "making," when "a thing is made up of Particles, which did all of them before exist."28 Thus, creation and making are differentiated as alternative types of causal relations such that creating presupposes that matter is created ex nihilo, whereas making implies that existing matter is reconstituted in some way analogously to the work of the workman or artist. Strictly, God is the "creator" as he formed the universe out of nothing.29 Men, however, are the "makers" as they can produce only from preexisting matter and are unable to create anything ex nihilo. There are two forms of making for mankind, material making and intellec- tual making. Material making includes the work of the workman or artificer such as the watch or clock-maker.30 Intellectual making is the function of the understanding. Simple ideas are derived from sensation and reflection and are true copies/ectypes. These ideas, the materials of knowledge, are not made by man but are conveyed into the mind via the senses or are the product of reflec- tion by the mind on its own activities. Complex ideas are threefold: complex ideas of substances are inadequate copies of real essences which are unknow- able; complex ideas of mixed modes and of relations are archetypes as they are the real essences of their own ideas.31 The nominal essences of the complex ideas of substances together with the real essences of complex ideas of mixed modes and of relations are derived by acting on the simple ideas; working on simple ideas to produce complex ideas and the nominal essences of substances 27 Tully, Discourse, 10, 34, argues that the relation between God and man "is a natural relation with respect to man but instituted with respect to God," but such a hybrid model is not put forward in the Essay as an account of the relation between man and God and, if present, would undercut the notion of reciprocity in all these relations. Further, as instituted relations are those potentially alterable relations between men which depend on their wills or agree- ment within society, this cannot be an apt description of God's will for mankind, which is unalterable and independent of men and their agreements. 28 Essay, II.xxvi.2. 29 God the "creator" occurs at Essay, II.i.15; II.vii.3; II.xxiii.12; IV.iii.6,23; IV.iv.14; IV.x.18; IV.xvi.12. 30 Essay, III.vi.39; IV.iii.25 31 Essay, II.xii.3-6; II.xxxi.12-14. 88</page><page sequence="7">Locke's Theology and Political Philosophy is therefore a form of"making" analogous to that of the artificer, artist or work- man.32 More comprehensively, intellectual making includes the formation of all general and abstract ideas together with the sorting of things. Although intellectual and material making are presented as analogous, there is a shift in terminology for intellectual making where the products of the mind are desig- nated as the "workmanship" of the mind,33 whereas the term "workmanship" is not actually used to describe the product of the workman or artificer. As noted extensively in the literature, mankind is also God's workman- ship,34 but this formulation of the relation between man and God neglects the obverse which is that the idea of God is the workmanship of mankind.35 Apart from two initial and somewhat passing references to God's "workmanship" in Book One,36 the first developed use of the so-called workmanship model oc- curs not with respect to man as God's workmanship but in terms of the account of intellectual activities in Book Three. The complex ideas of mixed modes and relations include the terms of morality, man's highest intellectual endeavor, and also the various relational ideas of God and mankind. The absolute idea mankind has of God as a complex idea is a nominal essence, inadequate to the real being of God.37 The relational idea mankind has of God as maker and mankind as God's workmanship is a combination of this complex idea with that of another relation, that of cause and effect, and is thus an archetype. These ideas of God, therefore, together with all the other ideas that mankind has of God, including the fundamental relation of cause and effect itself,38 are the workmanship of their maker, human understanding. Thus, the relational idea that mankind has of God as his own maker and of itself as God's workmanship is itself the workmanship of the human mind. The order of cause and effect is thus reversed as mankind, the effect of God, is the cause of the idea of God as the cause of itself. The "workmanship" model of the relation between God and man presents man's idea of God as his maker and of himself as God's workmanship in terms of an image of his own process of understanding. God as maker of mankind thus becomes a metaphorical embodiment of man's highest faculty, his intel- 32 Essay, II.ii.2; II.xii. 1. Cf.

In this paper I shall argue that its function in the Essay is not reproduced in the Two Treatises. 36 At I.iii.26 and I.iv. 13 in the context of the argument against there being any innate ideas of the relation between God and man. 37 Essay, III.vi.l1. 38 Essay, II.xxii. 10,11. 89</page><page sequence="8">Vivienne Brown lectual faculty, and so the figure of God is made in man's best self-image. But the metaphor of God's workmanship is itself functioning analogically with reference to an extended epistemological metaphor of the human understand- ing based on material making.39 It is acknowledged in the literature that the workmanship metaphor implies that in respect to the archetypes of the under- standing, "man is, epistemologically, in a position similar to God" for the rea- son that "between God and man as makers, anything true of one will be, ceteris paribus, true of the other."40 But this interpretation gives only one half of the story.41 It is not just that man may aspire to knowledge or dominion in so far as his making mirrors God's making or that his rational faculty is deemed his most God-like characteristic in that "the most excellent Part of his Workman- ship, [is] our Understandings."42 In addition and crucially, the figure of God as maker of mankind is conceived by means of an analogy with human intellec- tual workmanship, and God's excellence is conceived in terms which derive from that which is considered most excellent in man. God the creator has been recast as God the maker, thus eliding his uniquely divine power of creation with the human mode of merely making; but in thus honoring God's workman- ship, man's own making is thereby celebrated.43 This not only implies a rever- sal of the significance of the workmanship metaphor of God and man but un- derscores just how thoroughly God has been fashioned in the image of man- kind.44 That man's notion of God is made in man's image is also evident in the proof of the existence of God which is based on the idea of the relation between God and mankind as one of cause and effect.45 The form of this proof is to start with what man knows of himself and to derive a proof of God's existence and 39 Although, as noted above, the term "workmanship" is not used to describe the product of material making. The extent of the similarity between material and intellectual making is an issue that lies outside the scope of this paper. 40 Tully, Discourse, 22, 37, where God's dominion over his workmanship explains man's dominion over the products of his (man's) making; the causation thus runs from God to man. 41 It also neglects the point that the workmanship model of the understanding includes nominal essences and the sorting of things, as well as the archetypes of the understanding. 42 Essay, IV.xviii.5. 43 Elsewhere God's power of creation and making are elided, e.g. Essay, IV.x. 18-19. Intel- lectual activities are on occasion also called the "creatures of the understanding," cf Essay, III.iii. Il 1; III.v.5, 12. 44 Tully, Discourse, 7, cites Barbeyrac's commentary as evidence for Locke's workman- ship model, but Barbeyrac transcribes Locke's workmanship relation as a creationist one based on the creator and his creatures: "The Idea of a Creator, boundless in Power, Wisdom and Goodness; and the Idea of our selves, as intelligent, reasonable, and sociable Creatures: These two Ideas, I say, if well look'd into and compar'd together in their whole Extent, will always furnish us with steady Grounds of Duty, and sure Rules of Conduct...."

The thing man knows intuitively is that he himself exists. Since it is presupposed that man has been created by something or other, and since "bare nothing" cannot create any real being, it follows that there must have been something which has existed from eternity and which could have created man.46 The existence of the figure of God as this eternal something is thus derived from the existence of man as a purportedly created being, but God is then endowed with human characteristics writ large. The first of these is power47 and the second is intelligence.48 God as an omnipo- tent and intelligent being is thus made in man's image: "Thus from the Consid- eration of our selves, and what we infallibly find in our own Constitutions, our Reason leads us to the Knowledge of this certain and evident Truth, That there is an eternal, most powerful, and most knowing Being; which whether any one will please to call God, it matters not."49 Mankind's epistemological acknowl- edgment of its own power and understanding thus forms the basis for the proof of the existence of God as a powerful and cogitative being who is mankind's maker and creator. III. In the Two Treatises of Government God created mankind "in his own Image after his own Likeness,"50 but this again raises questions about God's image and likeness and from where they are derived. In the Two Treatises God is sometimes portrayed in absolute terms: he is infinite,sl omnipotent,52 and the Almighty.3 God is also portrayed as the Makers4 and Creator55 of heaven and earth, the Author56 and Giver of life,57 where mankind is again his workman- ship,58 although here there is no epistemological context for this metaphor and making is not differentiated from creating. The workmanship relation is now 46 Here the two theories are elided by defending the argument that God created matter out of nothing on the grounds that to deny this implies denying "the first great piece of his Work- manship, the Creation," Essay, IV.x.18. 47 Essay, IV.x.4. 48 Essay, IV.x.5. 49 Essay, IV.x.6. This implies, however, that those characteristics which are lacking in man are also absent from the proof of the existence of God. In particular, the proof does not establish that goodness is an attribute of God, nor does it establish that God is the legislator for mankind, even though these are taken for granted elsewhere in the Essay. The failure of the Essay to provide a demonstrative ethics in spite of declarations of its being possible, is thus not unrelated to this. 50 TT 1.30; also 1.40. 1 ITT 1.6; 11.79.

The first passage which establishes mankind as God's workmanship does so by arguing against Filmer that it is "God our Maker," not earthly fathers, which gives life to men's offspring; but in countering Filmer's right of domination by earthly fathers, this passage argues that the notion of fatherhood applied to God the maker renders him "king" of all: [H]e has so visible a claim to us as his Workmanship, that one of the ordinary Appellations of God in Scripture is, God our Maker, and the Lord our Maker. And therefore though our A. for the magnifying his Fatherhood, be pleased to say, ... That even the Power which God him- self exerciseth over Mankind is by Right ofFatherhood, yet this Father- hood is such an one as utterly excludes all pretence of Title in Earthly Parents; for he is King because he is indeed Maker of us all, which no Parents can pretend to be of their Children.6 The workmanship relation together with the figure of God the father of all is here politicized by the representation of God also as king, a term which is not applied to God in the Essay. Further, in the First Treatise, "God the Maker of Heaven and Earth" is also described as "the sole Lord and Proprietor of the whole World" within the same sentence.6' In the Second Treatise the first pas- sage introducing the workmanship relation also politicizes the figure of God by making him the "one Sovereign Master."62 Thus the relation between God and man is expressed with reference to a number of different political relationships which variously embody God as king, sole lord, and sovereign master, as well as Maker and Creator. God must be all-powerful, of course, otherwise he is no 59 Robert Filmer, Patriarcha and Other Writings, ed. Johann P. Sommerville (Cambridge, 1991). 60 T7T 1.53. 61 7T, 1.39. Also TT, 1.85.

Thus within the political discourse of the Two Treatises the figure of God has become politicized. God is even the "absolute monarch" of the universe.63 Thus it is a striking feature of this system of metaphorical representations of God that, although the primary aim of the Two Treatises is to attack absolute monarchy and argue the case for resistance, God himself is described as an absolute monarch, and his relation with mankind is that of an absolute monarch with the objects of his pleasure.64 Not only are these descriptions of God applied to the absolute mon- arch; the same structures of power relations that are the subject of criticism in the case of Filmer's absolute monarch are also applied to God. In God, the roles of father, lord, king, and sovereign master are combined. Different forms of power are represented, figuratively, in the commanding omnipotence of God, and mankind is simultaneously the child (i.e., the father's child; there is no mother to this child), subject, servant, and property of God. It was part of Locke's attack on Filmer's patriarchal absolutism that different kinds of power had been collapsed by him under a single type of political power in that Filmer had designated political power as fatherly power and had attributed absolute power to actual fathers. God by contrast stands as the divine embodiment of an absolute power that encompasses all these different forms of earthly powers between men. Part of the polemical force of establishing God as the absolute monarch of the universe is to displace any idea that a mere mortal might make title to being an absolute monarch on earth. In response to Filmer's vestingAdam with abso- lute sovereignty, counter-evidence is cited from the scriptures to show that Filmer has misread his sources in thinking that Adam has absolute power, as God alone wields such power. In response to Filmer's claim that Adam is "Lord or Proprietor of every Thing,"65 it is counterposed that it is God the Maker of Heaven and Earth who is "sole Lord and Proprietor of the whole World."66 Thus in arguing against Adam's absolute power, God is redescribed in just those disputed Adamite terms, viz. God is father, king, lord and proprietor. Whereas Filmer claimed that Adam like an absolute monarch had absolute power over life and death,67 it is on the contrary God who "is the Author and 63 TT II. 166.

In the Second Treatise, however, absolute monarchy itself is the object of attack as it is antithetical to the notion of a free and rational human nature created in the image of God; men would be reduced to the position of slaves or a herd of inferior creatures if they were to submit to such absolutism. It is here that the depiction of God as absolute monarch entails deeply problematic results for the political argument of the Two Treatises. In accordance with the positive conno- tations of the absolute power and sovereignty held by God, absolute power held by any man is not derogated if the prince is "God-like" and if the power is used for the public good as defined according to God's will-the law of nature -that mankind should be preserved.7' Tyranny is the exercise of power beyond anyone's right only if that power is used for private advantage rather than the public good: "so Tyranny is the exercise of Power beyond Right, which no Body can have a Right to. And this is making use of the Power any one has in his hands; not for the good of those, who are under it, but for his own private separate Advantage."72 Similarly, the use of prerogative, or the power to act according to discre- tion either against the law or where the law is silent or tardy, is condoned as long as the ruler acts for the public good.73 Prerogative is defined as "This Power to act according to discretion, for the publick good, without the pre- scription of the Law, and sometimes even against it,"74 explicitly rejecting an alternative definition where any use at all of arbitrary power necessarily im- plies harm to the people, on the grounds that such a notion of prerogative would imply that men were "so void of Reason, and brutish, as to enter into Society upon such Terms."75 As the use of prerogative is bounded only by the extent to which it is aimed at securing the public good, it follows that good princes may legitimately assume arbitrary power. The analogy with God is now explicit: 68 1T 1.52. 69 7T, 1.9. 70 T7, II.6. 71 T, II. 134-35. 72 TT II. 199.

Indeed, such princes cannot have too much prerogative: "For as a good Prince, who is mindful of the trust put into his hands, and careful of the good of his People, cannot have too much Prerogative, that is, Power to do good...."77 The liberties of the people will suffer by consequence, however, as confirmed by the saying that "the Reigns of good Princes have been always most dangerous to the Liberties of their People";78 but this is a problem only in so far as successive and less virtuous kings try to use this enhanced power for their own ends rather than for the preservation of the people. As long as it is a good prince who extends the prerogative, the public good is safeguarded even though liberties are eroded. One difference between this benign case and one where the public good is subservient to the desires of the monarch, lies in the presence of the people's acquiescence in the benign case. Where the monarch is good, the people acqui- esce in his arbitrary power because they are confident that he will pursue the public good and use the prerogative to promote the end for which it was de- signed.79 In this case the people forego something of their liberties in the belief that the monarch will use his power benignly. A major issue here, however, lies in the difficulty of defining the "public good" where opposing interests and principles are at stake and where the notion of the "public" as a single entity becomes problematic; a contemporary example would have been the conten- tious issue of extending religious toleration by means of the royal prerogative to both nonconformists and Catholics. In view of the political issues at stake, the imputation to any monarch of a commitment to something as opaque as the public good suggests a considerable deference to monarchical judgment. The risks attached to such an argument in favor of prerogative are revealed in the issue of who shall be the judge to decide whether this power has in fact been used properly for the public good. Here there is a structural identity between 76 TT, II. 166. A. John Simmons, The Lockean Theory of Rights (Princeton, 1992), 29-30, n. 39, cannot believe that Locke is really intending to support this claim, but chapter XIV of the Second Treatise is indeed directed to defending an extensive use of prerogative. Cf Dunn, Political Thought, 162, "it becomes clear that the law can be disregarded, if its purposes can be better served by so doing, and that the decision whether this is so is necessarily left to the executive." This implies, however, that the protection of liberties is not itself a purpose of the law. Pasquale Pasquino, "Locke on King's Prerogative," Political Theory, 26 (1998), 198-208, argues that Locke is constructing a constitutional theory of extralegal power. 77 ,1 II.164. 78 ,11 I.166. 79 T7 II.161,163-65. 95</page><page sequence="14">Vivienne Brown the benign and harmful forms of absolutism in that, in both cases, there is no judge on earth, and so the people have no other course but to appeal to heaven.80 In both cases the right to resistance is invoked when the people believe that the monarch's power is being used against the public good. The argument against such power is thus purely contingent: where abso- lute power is used for the good of the society, there can be no argument against it. As God rules the universe, so God-like princes may rule their kingdoms; just as men can have no complaint against God's omnipotence, so they have no right to claim that a good prince has overstepped his authority in acting beyond the law. But in this case, men's liberties are only the means to an end-the end being God's will that mankind should be preserved-and are not an end in themselves. The liberties of the people may well suffer under a good prince, but this is sanctioned if God's will is otherwise being carried out; in the preser- vation of men's lives, liberties and estates, therefore, liberties are subordinate and even dispensable. In practical politics where the ruler is visibly unlike God, this contingent argument may suffice for the purpose of justifying a spe- cific instance of resistance. Taking a cynical view of kings and their moral qualities, the contingent argument might seem close to a necessary one, but yet historical experience is called upon to provide support for an extensive use of prerogative rather than to argue against it. In the history of England "Preroga- tive was always largest in the hands of our wisest and best Princes."8' And in the case of good kings, this power should not be bounded: it is "reasonable, that the People should not go about to set any Bounds to the Prerogative of those Kings or Rulers, who themselves transgressed not the Bounds of the publick good. For Prerogative is nothing but the Power of doing publick good without a Rule."82 A polemical point of contrast here may well have been that between the alleged historical precedent of good monarchs who could be en- trusted with an enlarged prerogative and the current monarch, who could cer- tainly not be trusted "without a Rule," but this historical argument provides corroboration of the acceptance in principle of an unbounded use of preroga- tive and the dispensability of people's liberties in given circumstances. Further, the definition of the public good, that mankind be preserved, itself derives from God's will which is the will of the absolute monarch of the universe; and this is independent of God's putative goodness. Thus, earthly absolutism is justified in so far as it fulfils the intentions of God, the ultimate source of absolute power in the universe, and is used only by those kings who are God-like in pursuing God's objectives. According to this argument, man's liberties are en- tirely contingent on circumstance; his being "void of Reason, and brutish" would thus derive from the act of investing absolute authority in one who ad- 80 TT 11.94, 168. 81 7 II.165. 82 T, II.166. 96</page><page sequence="15">Locke's Theology and Political Philosophy vances not the will of God, rather than in one who would erode accustomed liberties. The argument of the Two Treatises thus endorses earthly absolutism as long as it is used to further the public good, but the public good is not defined in terms of people's liberties. The verdict on any particular instance of absolut- ism is conditional on the good behavior of the absolute ruler construed in terms of implementing the divine will; absolutism itself as a form of government together with the inevitable erosion of liberties that it implies, is not subject to criticism. The liberties of the people are dispensable adjuncts to the furtherance of the divine will, and man has no rights of resistance against the absolute monarch of the universe, or at least not without threat of eternal damnation. The deeply illiberal stance of this aspect of the Two Treatises shows very pre- cisely the limits to the constitutionalism that was being offered as an attack on absolutism. How is this political representation of God to be read? One way of reading this would be to posit the theology as foundational for the political arguments. The theological acceptance of God as absolute monarch would then ground the limited liberalism of the political argument in that it is the theological account of man's dependence on an absolute God that ultimately provides for the illib- eral depiction of the dispensability of men's liberties. Here the theological por- trayal of God as absolute monarch grounds the conditional endorsement of earthly absolutism and circumscribes the liberalism of the argument for resis- tance. But if God indeed created mankind in his own image, then the theologi- cal portrayal of God as absolute monarch implies a particular view of human nature. The references to man's being made in God's image occur in the context of God's dominion of the world: "God makes him in his own Image after his own Likeness, makes him an intellectual Creature, and so capable of Dominion."83 Here the Two Treatises argues against Filmer that dominion of the inferior creatures is given to all mankind as a species and not exclusively to Adam. As an intellectual species, mankind is capable of dominion over the inferior crea- tures and it is this "species dominion" that is being likened to God's dominion over the earth. The extent of this dominion is not being controverted-that mankind is to have dominion over the works of God's hands-but it is argued here that this power is vested in all mankind and not in Adam exclusively.84 In addition to being the proprietor of all the earth, however, God is also lord, king and absolute monarch, and some of this absolute sovereignty also inheres in mankind even as individual natural men. In the original state of nature men are characterized by their freedom within the law of nature. With respect to God, 83 TT 1.30. Also 7T: 1.40. 84 T7 1.28. 97</page><page sequence="16">Vivienne Brown mankind is under an obligation to follow the law of nature, but with respect to each other, individual men enjoy a range of freedoms within the bounds of the law of nature. Even in this natural state, however, men's freedom is described in the language of political absolutism in that each man is "absolute lord" of his own "empire" and all men are "kings."85 Furthermore, in the state of nature each man is also judge and executioner in his own case,86 and now the analogy with absolute monarchy is explicit.87 The analogy raised is immediately coun- tered on the grounds that, in the original state of nature, any individual is an- swerable to the rest of mankind if he should judge amiss in his own case, but the homology between the propensity of natural man and of absolute monarchs to judge with partiality in their own particular cases is left untouched.88 The language of absolutism is thus reinscribed in Locke's discourse on natural man.89 God is the absolute monarch of the universe, and each natural man evinces his own germ of absolute power in the liberty and power he has in the state of nature where he is king and absolute lord of his own empire as against all other men. In the Two Treatises man is purportedly made in God's image, but the figure of God is expressed in terms of the political relations between men on earth, and natural man is also described in these political terms. There is thus no original starting point for the depiction of natural man, no pre-political state of nature or theological domain innocent of political preconceptions which can be thought to provide a natural foundation for property relations or for the formation of political society. Just as in the Essay, terrestrial figuration is in- scribed in Locke's theology in the Two Treatises, but here the figuration is political. In the proof of the existence of God in the Essay the first attribute of both man and God, after existence, was power; in the political discourse of the Two Treatises, this power is translated into a political vocabulary, even in the original state of nature. IV. The figure of God in Locke's Essay and Two Treatises is not a literal description of God's attributes but is constituted metaphorically within the dis- cursive requirements and constraints of Locke's texts. Rhetorically, the figure of God is functioning as a master trope, a "figure of thought" according to the categories of classical rhetoric,9 but one which is differently constituted ac- 85 TI7 11.123. Cf. natural men's individual "sovereignty" at T; II1.61. 86 TI: II.13, 87, 125, 136. 87 TT, 11.13. Also TI: II.90-91, 94. At T7, 11.8 it is said that the law of nature does not give any man an absolute or arbitrary power over any other man, but what is at issue is the way in which each man is judge and executioner in deciding his own case with respect to that law. 88 Cf. TT, II.124-25. 89 Cf. Wolterstorff, Ethics of Belief, 151, "In Locke's epistemological thought, as well as his political thought, the sovereign individual occupies center stage." 90 The provenance of these rhetorical terms has been much disputed, see RichardA. Lanham, A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms (Berkeley, 1991), 178. 98</page><page sequence="17">Locke's Theology and Political Philosophy cording to the specific characteristics of each text. The Essay is an epistemo- logical discourse which examines man's thinking faculty. In this text God is a powerful intellectual figure, the ultimate cogitative being whose own work- manship functions analogously with the epistemological model of the work- manship of the understanding. The Two Treatises is a political discourse ex- amining the locus and origins of political power. God now becomes a political figure who is the king and lord of all; God's omnipotence is no longer an abstract or divine power but is expressed in terms of the language of political discourse, and even more ironically for a treatise arguing against absolute gov- ernment, the figure of God is also the absolute monarch who is above the law. The Essay argues that notions of God are made by man, whereas the Two Treatises argues that man is made in God's image; these two opposing formu- lations set the binary limits within which the complex relation between God and man is developed, but the lines of opposition also mark out the lines of mutual interdependence since man's concepts of God and of himself are each made in the image of the other. The question of the relation between Locke's theology and his moral and political thought cannot, therefore, be answered in terms of a unidirectional or even a multidirectional system of determination, because the figure of God is constituted by the same categories as those to which it has been thought to relate in a logically determining or explanatory sense. Discussion in the literature has focused on the question whether Locke's political philosophy in the Two Treatises is grounded in his theology; for ex- ample, whether the political argument against absolute government is grounded in a religious individualism enshrined by the law of nature. But if that individu- alism is formulated in terms of the language of political relations between men on earth, including the language of political absolutism itself, then such talk of overall foundations and systems of determination is not adequate to portray the complex relation between God and mankind and between theological and po- litical discourses. Furthermore, the politicization of the figure of God compromises the clas- sic liberal fiction of the pre-political state of nature as it also circumscribes the liberal constitutionalism of the Two Treatises where men's liberties are only a contingent and not a necessary part of the political order for mankind as or- dained by God, the absolute monarch of the universe. Far from straightfor- wardly providing the individualist underpinnings for Locke's political liberal- ism, the theological arguments are interwoven with the political ones in delim- iting that liberalism by subordinating men's liberties to the furtherance of God's absolute power, while also investing each natural man with his own quotient of absolute power. It has become an accepted historiographical and exegetical principle that reading Locke's texts chronologically and in their proper historical context will provide insights into the development of a man's mind over time and into his 99</page><page sequence="18">100 Vivienne Brown intentions in writing. This paper has argued, however, that the figure of God is not invariant across Locke's texts but is constituted to some degree by its tex- tual location and so does not have a stable identity even where, in the case of the Essay and Two Treatises, the texts concerned are contemporaneous prod- ucts. Rhetorically, the figure of God unsettles the stability of Locke's theology, as it also circumscribes the vaunted liberalism of Locke's political philosophy. The Open University.</page></plain_text>
