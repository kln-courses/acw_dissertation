<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Sense of Place (Analysis of Architecture) Robin Walker When I speak of a sense of place, when one imagines and identifies oneself with a place or a site, there is immediately an awareness of its physical and metaphysical properties. Christopher Alexander (1) suggests that our open society is no longer place-based and that, in searching to cure the present defects of urbanism, place-oriented thinking has little relevance. I would disagree because it seems to me that it is as much satis- factory interaction and identification with place as it is satisfactory interaction with people that modern man is seeking. Foolishly? Intuitively and instinctively, I think. Man's image of place, particularly of home, seems to me instinctually and explicitly sensual and his demand to satisfy this image a normal expectation. Event and place, in memory, are in- separable and so action and environment are inseparable. On a purely functional level, one knows that environments are designed for actions, or potential actions. It is equally true that environments designate actions. 'Unfortunately, aware- ness of the fact that surroundings exert a profound effect on human life is based largely on untutored observations and has not yet been converted into scientific knowledge.' (2) And, in the sense that we -understand scientific, will not be. Scientific enquiry is aimed at bringing order into what might appear to be chaos. L6vi-Strauss stresses, in The Savage Mind, the existence of two distinct modes of scientific thought, 'one roughly adapted to that of perception and the imagination: the other at a remove from it.' (3) Since Graeco-Roman times the latter mode, in its search for order, has been unduly influenced by the aim of a utilitarian conquest of the environment; ordering for the sake of material gain. That other mode of scientific enquiry, which we have ignored and forgotten (that of primitive and mediaeval man) was, however, much more concerned with order seen from a purely aesthetic stand- point. Sadly we have now convinced our- selves that it is morally unjustified to hold such a view, to search for that kind of order which is expressed in Myth. The characteristics of the environment take on a different meaning according to the particular historical and technical form assumed in it by this or that type of activity, and the relationships are the out- come of a number of different but inter- related attitudes, factors and actions, beliefs and observations of an analytical and conceptual nature which I will attempt to clarify under some arbitrarily chosen and overlapping headings. First, there is the Practical, that is the func- tional, ecological or other materialistic 17 2</page><page sequence="2">attitudes; second there is the Theoretical, that is the hypothetical, Utopian, political/social systems attitude; third there is the Sensual, that is the physiol- ogical, nervous, bodily reaction, and fourth there is the Spiritual, that is the mysterious, magical, transcendental attitude. The Practical The codified philosophy of the modern movement in architecture and planning has prevented us, until now, from enquir- ing too deeply into the subjective matter of our studies. An objective approach to the analysis of problems based on quantifiable data has led, if we are to accept the views of our lay critics, to a sterile environment with which people can feel no relationship, no sympathy, and from which they become alienated. Karl Popper in his essay, Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition, (4) postulates the impossibility of ever free- ing ourselves from tradition and accepts the need, particularly when dealing with the social sciences, to understand in a general way what may be the function and significance of a tradition. The rejection of traditional forms in favour of rationally conceived forms is respon- sible, to some extent, for our present dilemma and the failures of our modern environments. The brutalising of our cities and towns by the enthusiastic application, on a large scale, of rigid and Utopian theories of planning and design by inferior skills and crude techniques of construction, is all too evident to all of us, even to those of us who have been most committed to and perhaps blinded by the aims of the movement. The practice of zoning which stems from the 19th century Utopians and particularly from Garnier's Cit6 Industrielle, coupled with the impetus given by Le Corbusier to the con- cept of the isolated building free in space has inhibited the development of variety in the handling of sites which is an essential element of identification with place. The whole principle of zoning is based on the optimisation of a specific utilis- ation of the site which inevitably leads to a monotonous, monopolistic approach. An analysis in detail of any site will suggest the possibility of multiple use, if it is searched for. It is our planning methods based, at the time of their promulgation, on untested theories of separation of uses, which prevents us from reducing our scale of examination to such a detailed analysis. Studies of organic cities which developed on laissez-faire action would show in many cases that we are quite cap- able of living harmoniously and pleasur- ably in a multi-mixed area. There is an optimum size and scale for a place enabling it to be distinguishable, which is relative to its function, to its relationships to other places and to the parts of which it is composed. The degree of distinction attributable to a place varies from that of belonging to a city (a depersonalised concept) to that of belong- ings (one's house, car etc). It is a function of the designer to enable the user to become aware of these distinctive relationships, indeed it is to some degree his function to induce (for the common good?) an awareness. It is lack of this awareness which leads to loss of identity. Whilst there is a social need to create a physical space with utilitarian function, there is an equal need to construct a symbolic environment with a personal significance to the individual. Small is beautiful and big can also be; it is a question of scale. We suffer today from things which are too big, not because they are absolutely too big, but because they are out of scale with their function. We condemn the large corporations as "giants", we mean they have broken with their proper scale. Reduction in size of 18</page><page sequence="3">areas to be dealt with to a size approp- riate to the scale of the enterprise will enable a progressively closer analysis and determination to be made of the function of the design in territorial terms. (5) The smaller the area becomes, so the control of the environment reaches the point where a person's imaginative correspon- dence or identification focuses down to an actual tactile awareness. Similarly, the analysis of the site and its functional relationships becomes more and more acute. Site analysis may take many forms and should cover as many factors as are appropriate -- topography as a mosaic of slope areas, circulation networks, fields of view, probable microclimates and so on. It must also be judged as a total system, a unique landscape, a place of particular character. We are familiar with this con- cept of the character of a place and we are also certain that it cannot easily be analysed or expressed. It is here that, in reaction to the environment, in the inter- action of people with environment, we reach the core of the matter. Although the idea of the place may not be capable of precision, analysis on a practical basis of the nature of the site is of course essential to the formulation of a design for its exploitation. The practical analysis is essential and cannot be made complete without involving in the analysis the relationship or potential relationship of the site to people. That there is an inter- action between people and place is, I think, irrefutable. It is not simply a question of communication between people. The communication is person to person, person to site, and, at least in a physical sense if not indeed in a meta- physical sense, site to person. The Theoretical The development of architecture and planning, from the 19th century until now, has been characterised by the progressive acceptance of the philosphy of the Polytechnicians (which has spread to all aspects of bureaucratic socialism and bureaucratic capitalism). It was a necessary tactic of the revolution, of the subversion of the established decadence in art and architecture, that the founding fathers of the Modern Movement and its great pro- ponents from Sullivan and Wright to Le Corbusier, Gropius and Mies van der Rohe, should have unintentionally diminished (except to their sympathisers) their real artistic intentions and exagger- ated their professed adherence to fervently social/functional/economic causes. Perhaps only by this prostitution could the projects of their less iconoclastic followers have been realised. It was an unfortunate, if necessary, tactic in the sense that it permitted the material- istically, or purely socially conscious client (modern bureaucracy) to extract from the philosophy of the movement its most mundane tenets and elevate these to a doctrine which has profoundly degraded society's conception of the role which architecture can play in sustaining society. Whatever are our particular attitudes to the exhortations of the protagonists of the Modern Movement and to their products, it is clear that the most notable, most susceptible to identification and interaction by people, either by attraction or retraction, have been the isolated phenomena of their work. What is being attacked now by society is not those trans- cendental masterpieces so much as the modern vernacular style which is the out- come of the Polytechnicians' insistence on the functional and particularly quanti- fiable aspects of design as the source, indeed spirit, of beauty; the "form follows function" tenet that confuses or limits its understanding of function to those elements which can be quantified. This 19</page><page sequence="4">Functionalist movement which began in the 19th century, and was fostered in- advertently by the writings of Ruskin and Morris in the Anglo-Saxon world, was given added impulse by the belief that the machine, as opposed to the human body, could be simulated as the source of discovery for a new architectural form. From antiquity until this age, the human body, as an expression or imitation of the cosmos, was the arbiter of form. Valery has Eupalinos explaining himself to Phaedrus, saying "'when I design a dwell- ing (whether it be for the gods or man), and when I lovingly seek its form, study- ing to create an object that shall delight the view, that shall hold converse with the mind, that shall accord with reason and the numerouz proprieties.... I confess, how strange soever it may appear to you, that it seems to me that my body is play- ing a part in the game...."' (6) Compare this with the idolatry of the Futurists for the machine, Le Corbusier's "machine for living" or in modern literature the extraordinary poetry of Flann O'Brien's exposition of the bicycle cult. I think we have to accept that the love affair between Flann O'Brien's hero and his bicycle, Duchamp's Bicycle Wheel, Picasso's Venus du Gaz, and the attitude to the machine whose roots may be found as Mumford and Siegfried Giedion suggest, in the development of the clock- work/modern armies of the 17th century, on the one hand satirise and on the other parallel and underlie the modern insis- tence on the mechanistically quantifiable systems approach to all problem solving and action in whatever branch of science or social action is under study. In build- ing its expression is obvious, scraped of all imagination, all subtlety, in the banal vernacular. This is not to deny the value of a systems approach nor the value of trans-substantiating our body into that of a machine for the purpose of releasing our imaginations. It is simply to state that when this apiCproach is carried to an exclusive 6'tLnjce, as I believe it has been, the product is insensitive, lacks perspic- acity and is banal. Of course techniques of anaiyv;i: which produce quantifiable data are esential for action but it is perhaps in considering the manner or method of action that hope for a solution may lie. We have acted for years past on the basis that the larger the unit of territory to be planned and the more definitive our plans are, the more successful they are likely to be. Though this may be generally true in so far as the greater whole inevitably affects the smaller part and if the whole is right the parts should, therefore, also be right, it has tended to concentrate our attention on the larger scale political-social-econ- omic factors of development at the expense of the study of the smaller scale physical site development. As in the field of architectural theory, a divorce between theory and action is apparent. Recent discussion of architecture uses, as a critical reference, political, sociological and semiological yardsticks, 'space has been reduced to a product of such dis- courses' (7) and the physical matter of vernacular building relegated to the specification of accommodation to be ful- filled by industrial systems. It is necessary for us to begin again to realise that prac- tice, action, cannot be divorced from theory, that both must be considered as simultaneous action. Though theory may, in fact, precede, in consciousness, action, it presupposes action. Though Space, Time and Architecture may be separate concepts, when faced with the action of building, the concepts fuse into an inter' active whole. The building is not in space, in a place, it is that place. Sensual In the sense of how a place speaks to people or holds silence, Segesta, Delphi 20</page><page sequence="5">Glendalough, Ahenny, Isd are places and architectural sites which speak clearly even to bus-loads of bored tourists. However, 'the "concrete fact" is at the basis of both spatial knowledge and spatial occupation.... The art-architecture dialectic had to-date been built upon a multiplicity of attitudes which, however, had not regarded the environment as the "place of a person".... And yet there is a dialectical relationship between environ- mental space and human presence'. (8) To an extent, the extent to which there is a deliberate attempt to stir associational reactions and memories in the parti- cipants by these art forms, there is, of course, a relationship here with the researches in architecture (and planning) by the Adhocists (9). But these are at a superficial level, dealing in images rather than in the realm of actual sensory perception. By sensory perception, I do mean bodily perception - the kind of re- action to places and things which one occasionally experiences, the shiver down the spine, the trembling in the stomach, awe and perplexity as well, of course, as the less dramatic, less stirring feelings of comfort, warmth and ease. "Listen Phaedrus, this little temple, which I built for Hermes, a few steps from here, if you could know what it means to me! There where the passer-by sees but an elegant chapel - 'tis but a trifle: four columns, a very simple style - there I have en- shrined the memory of a bright day in my life. O sweet metamorphosis! This delicate temple, none knows it, is the mathematical image of a girl Corinth, whom I happily loved. It reproduces faithfully proportions that were peculiarly hers. It lives for me! It gives me back what I have given it" (10).... I have been moved to throw my arms about the Parthenon's columns and if I can love Amiens and love the Pantheon, can you not love place, isn't that what an under- standing of site, interaction with site means.... Anthropomorphic symbolism? Probably the most interesting relative study is being undertaken by artists working in the fields of "conceptual art", "body art", and what may now simply be termed "space art". 'The "objectual", figural and optical-kinetic streams were brought together in 1968 in a type of environmental work which was con- cerned with the factual analysis of topo- logical space'. (11).... 'While some "con- ceptual" artists were refuting the art object, others saw the experience of space and of their body as providing the most immediate and existentially real alter- native. The move from objective consideration of objects in the early sixties, to the mingling of experience, pre- cepts and concepts generally conceded by the "conceptual movement" became a wave engulfing all kinds of creativity....' (12) 1 am reminded immediately of a work by Brian King, carried out as his summer school in 1976 at Cumeen Strand below Knocknarea in County Sligo, consisting of four glass boxes placed in the sea at low tide. As the tide rose gradually and reached the lips of them one was con- fronted by four square holes in the sea - the boxes themselves being invisible. Then the sea filled them. As the tide receded it left four free standing pillars of water which, in time, slowly seeped away, to start again the same process, all over again. A modern equivalent of Manannan's Crane Bag? When the sea was full, all the treasures were visible in it; when the fierce sea ebbed, the crane bag was empty'. Extra sensory perception aside, plain sensory perception can be cultivated and if it is not felt to be a necessary training for every youth or adult, it is certainly necessary for the planner and architect, since the assumption that the architect's creative gift enables him, during his education and practice, to project him- self imaginatively into a situation or 21</page><page sequence="6">event, is not, by the evidence of his failures, substantiated. The theoretical basis of training and practice tends to relegate actual sensory perception to the background of personal experience on which the architect may draw, so concerned are the schools to produce new solutions. The truly scientific method is neither empirical nor theoretical. It does not consist in standing outside the event, observing and analysing, nor does it consist simply of theorising, applying the theory, and testing the results. It is an amalgam, (and certainly in the field of design) a matter of sensually experienc- ing an event, theorising, hypothesising, observing and testing the hypothesis. 'Neither observation nor reason are authorities. Intellectual intuition and imagination are most important, but they are not reliable: they may show us things very clearly, and yet they may mislead us. They are indispensable as the main sources of our theories; but most of our theories are false anyway. The most important function of observation and reasoning, and even of intuition and imagination, is to help us in the critical examination of those bold conjectures which are the means by which we probe into the unknown.' (13) In the case of the "artistic" method, one may not actually sensually experience an event, but, by his being an artist, the scientific artist (really synonymous) projects himself imagin- atively into the sensual event or experience. The sixth sense, muscular perception, is clearly expressed in architectural structure. An architect explains natural forces to himself when designing by imagining his bodily reactions to them and they are frequently explicitly expressed as in, for example, the Caryatids. In painting and sculpture, this metamorphosis of the human body, of muscular action into the composition of line, plane or solid, is even more strongly seen. Michelangelo's works as much as the works of the abstract expressionists are examples. A similar phenomenon is evident in the expression of the machine, of mechanical energy, in modern art and architecture. As previously noted, the Futurists spring immediately to mind, and Flann O'Brien's character in The Third Policeman, part man, part bicycle, and perhaps even Le Corbusier's dictum 'the house is a machine for living', and the expressionism of satellites and moon vehicles in Archigram projects can also be taken as evidence. The work of the land- scape painters at all periods confirms my view that the form of reality is not wholly understood without the aid of extra senses, Oscar Wilde, in The Critic as Artist, goes further when he says that 'art is more real than reality' (14) and suggests that our creative critical spirit influences and can change our perception of land- scape, people, objects and in fact our total environment. Sensual perception shades into spiritual conception. Magic and mysticism play a real role in our under- standing of form, space and place. The Spiritual Just as the practical and theoretical are hard to separate, so the sensual and spiritual attitudes to a site are hardly distinguishable. But I mean by spiritual, those attitudes and reactions which are overtly, if one may use the word, of a mysterious, magical, spiritual and relig- ious quality and significance. And also under this heading comes the wealth of knowledge we possess of our environ- ment which is uncoded, non-scientific but knowledgeable, intuitive, instinctive, emotional - an immeasurable extent of knowledge which can only be com- prehended in terms of explicitly sensual or spiritual experience and form; that is, metaphysical, "prefactual" knowledge, 'what we know directly and immediately, 22</page><page sequence="7">as distinct from what we know by reflec- tion, inference and abstraction.' (15) Rites, both secular and religious, are still performed in relation to the natural and man-made environment at various stages in the exploitation of the environ- ment, even though theology, by attempt- ing to imitate science, has degraded myth to the level of mere objective science and history. The turning of the first sod, lay- ing the foundation stone, "wetting" the walls, "wetting" the roof, "topping out", the opening ceremony and so on are, at least in holy Ireland, still an important and meaningful part of the process of designing and building our environ- ments. And if the legendary story related by Plutarch (16) of the religious rites which founded Rome only amuses us and such rites are seen by us to-day as merely an irrelevance, I believe then we have only ourselves to blame for the soullessness of our new cities. Romulus, he says, 'set to building his city, and sent four men out of Tuscany who directed him by sacred usages and written rules in all the ceremonies to be observed, as in a relig- ious rite. First, they dug a round trench about that which is now the comitium or court of assembly, and into it solemnly threw the first fruits of all things either good by custom or necessary by nature; lastly, every man taking a small piece of earth of the country from whence he came, they all threw in promiscuously together. This trench they call, as they do the heavens, Mundus; making which their centre, they described the city in a circle around it.' I am sure it is not beyond our wit to devise a comparably meaningful ritual expression of the founding of a new town or housing estate, shopping centre, school or industrial estate, which would impress on those who will occupy it and those who will direct its development the magnitude and deeper meaning, the sanctity, of their undertaking. We do not build with much faith. Reading the account of Plutarch one is struck forcefully, I think, by the fact that it was the people of the three communities themselves who performed the cere- mony, whereas nowadays, in most cases, who knows who will inhabit our new places? Despite their expressed willing- ness, indeed desire on the part of Irish local authority planners and adminis- trators, school managers, principals and shopping centre speculators to create neighbourhood units and centres which could become places with an identity of their own and with which their inhabit- ants could feel a sense of identity, feel a sense of place, no coherent system of bringing all those concerned together at the inception of a project exists. The names on a housing list or potential buyers are so far removed from those responsible for the development, un- known to them as a consequence of our market economy, that it is not possible to involve the future inhabitants in even the design of-their new environment let alone participate in some such ritual at its foun- dation. The residents' association (if there is one) generally comes into existence solely for the purpose of lodging complaints against the lack of amenities and failures in function of the neighbour- hood or township and is not represented at its foundation. Lethaby, in Architecture, Mysticism and Myth (17) shows how, in their build- ings and towns and in their decoration, the ancients of all parts of the world applied constructively their "scientific- ally" religious understanding of nature and how their works were models, imitations, of their scientific concept of the cosmos; the firmament as a dome, the vault of heaven.... Today we regard nature as a "utility", we attach hardly any other significance to it and our exploit- ation of the site is almost of a purely utilit- arian order; even the "ecological" 2 3</page><page sequence="8">approach is not more at base, than a more rewarding, better formulated utilit- arianism. "All sacred things have their place." (18) It could even be said that being in their place is what makes them sacred, for if they were taken out of their place, even in thought, the entire order of the universe would be destroyed. Sacred objects therefore contribute to the maintenance of order in the universe by occupying the places allocated to them. Examined superficially and from the out- side, the refinements of ritual can appear pointless. They are explicable by a concern for what one might call "microadjustment" - the concern to assign every single creature, object, or feature, to a place within a class.(19) Until we can begin to grasp the deeper meaning of its discoveries and to translate modern science, through its creative potential, into a sacred expression in art and religion, we will fail to build meaningful and delightful environments, delightful to the gods and understood in that sense by ordinary mortals; that is, until science be- comes subject again to Myth, its factual and historical quality raised to the power of Myth, its materialistic "religion" a true Religion, which for Western man, at least, should (ad hoc) mean Christianity, 'one of the most incomparably beautiful myths that has ever flowered from the mind of man, or from the unconscious processes which shape it. (20) Watts gives consider- able space to arguing that myth does not mean "untrue" or "unhistorical" but is, rather, a complex of stories which, for various reasons, human beings regard as demonstrations of the inner meaning of the significance of the seven consecutive walls of their city with their several metals and colours; in what symbolic sense, like- wise, do the citizens of the USA under- stand their Empire State Building? In previous cultures, a long history of primitive contact with nature developed a profound respect, a reverence, for natural form in which was seen evidence of a larger order to which man felt inexorably linked. For the Japanese this order ex- pressed itself as the Organic way, for Western man it was expressed as the Geometric and for both cultures these be- came the religious and right way. 'The central mystery of the Celtic religion, and the ceremonial rituals which embodied its essence, will always be elusive. For many the Celtic mystique, with its romantic emphasis on the fairy and the spirit- world, has obscured the spirituality of these warrior peoples and the fact that they even had a religion.... the easy inter- mingling of physical and supernatural realms made the world of the Celtic imaginatiion tangible.... divine beings could shift from supernatural powers to human vulnerability.... No matter how extraordinary the deities were, they were still subject to the rhythms of this life and the demands of a particular locale. Each province or area had its sacred place that was the centre of its world; and the name of the place showed the relationship between earth and sky, the tribe and its divinity': (21) in Ireland the four pro- vinces and the elusive fifth. 'The use of the sacred centre underlies its traditional appeal as a regular meeting-place and also a mythical arena where momentous events could be shifted into the ever- present time-scale of the poem and the story'. (22) The triple headed images, the double headed Janus stone and the Tau cross (claimed as an old masonic symbol of the travelling stonemen), as John Sharkey writes, show the many faced and all- pervading power of consciousness that was central to the Celtic perception of the world; they remind me of Blake's saying "My mind looks out through my eyes" and their composition suggests, with the clarity of ambiguity, the no-beginning- no-end interwoven sight-lines of that consciousness flowing out from the 24</page><page sequence="9">central brain pan, from the sacred mind- centre of the world, the place and no- place of the fifth province, the solar boss of the Celtic cross. 'The Celtic and pre- Celtic shaman, the living embodiment of the collective psyche, was the link with the ancestral spirit world. The tradition of vision, and the inner quest by the shaman, the Druid, the saint or the holy man, seem to be concentrated at specific places where the energy forces of the planet are located.' (23) We might now think of these forces as the forces of matter and these places, like the boss, as the dimensionless points where the flux of consciousness fuses the ever-changing world, in which nothing is as it first appears, as matter fuses into living form. And what could be more expressive of the life of matter and the mortality of the animate than the human skulls in the doorposts of the Gallic temple of Roquepertuse? All great cultural Myths, in the richness of their tapestry of symbol, have already demonstrated this awareness of the life of matter. (24) Materialism has lost its rever- ence for material. The more completely scientific dis- coveries expound the nature of the universe the more they change our under- standing of the universe; the harder it then becomes for man to grasp its complexity. To contain and demonstrate this complexity in a comprehensible form, it seems to me, we must discover our Myth. If our centralised authorities could devolve their responsibilities to much smaller groups and could involve, from the start, the individuals being planned for in direct, on site, decisions, and if those individuals could in turn have the means to determine more precisely their habitations, the rape of the natural and the man-made environment would assume, at least, a more personal, a more human form. If the sacred quality of the act of foundation, of exploitation, could be expressed, through a ritual devolu- tion of the process, perhaps the rape might be transformed to love. I cannot imagine that a small group of people, united to develop a site for themselves, and given the assistance of their own, selected architect or planner, would not approach the problem in a so much more sensitive way than can bureaucracy, that the product would have the soulless lack of quality that it now displays. The environments of pre-industrialised periods and cultures which we nostal- gically admire were produced in this way and their production was attended by ritual and considered as a spiritual as well as a functional action. 'When cities were first founded, an old Egyptian scribe tells us, the mission of the founder was "to put the gods in their shrines". The task of the coming city is not essentially different: its mission is to put the highest concerns of man at the centre of all his activities: to unite the scattered fragments of the human personality....' And Mumford pursues his theme thus, 'The city first took form as the home of a god: a place where eternal values were represented and divine possibilities revealed. Though the symbols have changed, the realities behind them remain. We know now. as never before, that the undisclosed potentialities of life reach far beyond the proud algebraics of contemporary science; and their promise for the future transformations of man are as enchanting as they are inexhaustible. Without the religious perspectives fostered by the city, it is doubtful if more than a small part of man's capacities for living and learning could have developed. Man grows in the image of his gods, and up to the measure they have set. The mixture of divinity, power and person- ality that brought the ancient city into existence must be weighed out anew in terms of the ideology and the culture of our time....' (25) 25</page><page sequence="10">Conclusion The smaller the actual size of the element with which we deal, the greater the chance that it is handled with under- standing, an understanding capable of reflecting all its complexities and, in the case of the relationship of the exploit- ation to its site, of expressing all the subtleties of the essence of the site, of a place. We have, as architects, con- centrated our five senses on the problem; in those terms our work is well re- searched. But our sixth (the muscular or sensual) and seventh, if there is such a one it is the spiritual sense, these extra senses have not been brought to bear adequately on the problem and are not well re- searched. In fact, as a result of the 17th century scientific revolution, we tend to distrust them, to shy away from their disturbing promptings and to limit our consideration of the more easily managed quantifiable aspects of the problem, as though these promptings stemmed from some fearful magic. We have to make our own 'magic, test and criticise it, not patiently over a long time as primitive man presumably did, but impatiently and intensively. In this action the work of the painters and sculptors has immense value to us as architects and planners. We can capitalise on their work as though they were making prototypes for us - which hopefully may become valid stereotypes. This is what the Modern Movement set out to do in its search for a new order in co-operation with all the arts. And this is what our backward glancing nostalgia for the past, is teaching us: quite simply that our modern proposition of order (the bureaucratic vernacular) is poverty stricken. It is incapable of presenting us with a theoretically convincing, sensually satisfactory structure derived from events creating structures or structures creating events. When bureaucracy appears to act like an immovable mass it is because it acts the part badly - a mass can be made to act like a being. It is our intention to give "life" to the mass, to matter and to the site, like Eupalinos and his Corin- thian girl-friend. I am stunned by the realisation that there is nothing in modern "vernacular" planning or architecture which I would feel proud to present to my love, nothing stemming directly from our serious, responsible, socially conscious, bureau- cratic building programmes for the first, second or third worlds which I could genuinely, with love, present to my love. It is, of course, absurd to expect that mass programmes over huge acreages could produce such quality. The reduction to its appropriate scale of the size of element to be studied and the devolution of this study to the people actually concerned, which I propose, must enable those practical, theoretical, sensual and spirit- ual attitudes to assume a greater role in determination, and seems to me the only rational road by which the complexity and variety and reverence necessary to create the kind of environment we are seeking can be found. My understanding of "rational" is influenced by Karl Popper's (26) philosophy of falsifiability, his premise (crudely expressed as follows) that we cannot prove our hypotheses, our deductions, to be true, but that they may be proved false; and thence rejected: When we act on a large scale, on the basis of hypotheses which have not been exhaustively tested, to the point that they have not been found not to be false, we risk very large scale damage to society and the environment. It seems to me that this is exactly what has happened over the last thirty years; for example, the theoretic- ally based exclusive use of system-built tower blocks of flats as a panacea for our housing problems has been proved in- effective, that is, false. This is one of the reasons that I see the adoption of small size, small scale developments, as an experimental prodedure, valuable. Our 26</page><page sequence="11">errors would be less devastating. On a purely practical level it would enable us to test again and again our theories. And if it is argued that small scale experiments are not capable of testing the effects of the large scale actions which are now considered inevitable, I can only fall back on the, possibly romantic, assertion that past, reasonably satisfactory, social and environmental situations were essen- tially small scale, small size constructions applied generally. That is to say that they happened to, or were utilised to, create an ordered and coherent structure of an overall, widely, but temporarily, accepted pattern - a large scale application. More than that, it seems to me those constructions of the past, and of "primitive" cultures, were more compre- hensive than our present attempts at organisation; that they expressed more clearly and more acuitively the structur- ally necessary and complex balance of "firmness, commodity and delight", or the practical, theoretical, or sensual and spiritual attitudes that I have sketchily discussed. It may be that this very com- plex and "irrational" nature of their systems was the cause of their being superseded; but our, at least visually evi- dent, simplex and "rational" system of the last quarter century does not appear to have been a popular substitute. Without wishing to be a carrier of an 'epidemic of mysticism' (27) in Popper's words, I cannot see a way to solve our problems otherwise than in some practised synthesis of that complexity. If this, the metaphysical, religious, prayerful and simultaneously rational way, is not the way, then I feel like the British tourist who having been guided unwillingly to the top of a hill to look down on the plain at the trace of an ancient Roman road, complained "Buggered if I see any road, Roman or otherwise."

'Despite its richness and complexity, the symbolism of the Virgin gives a definite picture of her role in the scheme of Christ- ian mythology. The Virgin Mother is, first of all, Mater Virgo - virgin matter or the unploughed soil - that is to say, the Prima Materia prior to its division, or ploughing, into the multiplicity of created things. As Star of the Sea, Stella Maris (mare = Mary), the Sealed Fountain, "the immaculate womb of this divine font", she is likewise the Water over which the Spirit moved in the beginning of time. As the "woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet", (Revelations 12: 1) she is also everything signified in other mythologies by the goddesses of the moon, which shines by the sun's light, and appears in the night surrounded (crowned) with stars. As the Womb in which the Logos comes to birth, she is also Space, signified in the common artistic convention of clothing her in a blue mantle, spangled with stars. As the Jesse Tree, the Cedar of Libanus, the Cypress of Mount Sion, the Palm of Cades, and the Olive of the Plains, she is also to be identified with the Axle-Tree of the World, with the serpent at its roots - "it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise its heel"(Genesis 3 : 15) - and bearing alike the fruits of death and life. As the Rose and the Lily, she is the open cup of the flower, symbol of the recep- tive, passive, feminine aspect of man's spiritual transformation - represented also in the Chalice or Graal which received the life-blood of Christ. The Virgin Mary in Christianity thus typifies everything signified by Maya in Hindu- ism and Buddhism - that is, a female shakti, or consort, of God, the world which "God so loved", or the finite mani- festation of the infinite. The word Maya is derived from the root matr - to measure, from which in turn came p jrrjp(mother), metre, matrix, mater, and matter, for maya is that "no-thing" which, when measured or divided, becomes things.
