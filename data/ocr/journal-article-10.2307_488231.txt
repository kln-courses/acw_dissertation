<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter Benjamin: Ethnic Fears, Oedipal Anxieties, Political Consequences Beth Sharon Ash Contemporary responses to Walter Benjamin often take the form of theological readings that attempt to "provide the reader with those patterns and linkages that Benjamin implies but refuses to make,"' and then to fit Benjamin's coherent "text" to a changing present reality in order to fulfill not just a critical "but also a redemptive function."2 While theological reading prizes fidelity to both the letter and spirit of Benjamin's writing, it vitiates critical distance. When Benjamin's theo- logical impulse is adopted and conjoined to the interpreter's imposi- tion of narrative coherence, what is ultimately minimized, or even dis- avowed, is the inherent perplexity of Benjamin's work. Though I am an amateur reader of Benjamin, I find the psychological implications of Benjamin's theology - his unique style ofJewishness - difficult to minimize, especially when considered against the backdrop of the am- biguous position of Jews in Benjamin's Germany. A critical psychoan- alytic reading of Benjamin's Jewishness certainly requires careful atten- tion to what Benjamin says, but also skepticism in approaching and characterizing the limits and ambiguities of his own formulations. Benjamin never surrenders the theological motive for his writing: re- demption.3 From certain perspectives, Benjamin's "chiasmus of hope 1. Michael W.

Although Benjamin's writing is extremely diverse in other respects, it remains steadfast on the essential idea of redemption. For the early Benjamin "life in the profane continuum of history was considered incapable of fulfillment a priori insofar as it was 2</page><page sequence="2">Beth Sharon Ash 3 and catastrophe" appears highly attractive. As de Man has observed, readers such as Hartman have found particular power in Benjamin's his- torical concept of remembrance, in which hope derives from the critical destruction of images of frozen life and the subsequent recovery of living wish-fantasies. In this way, Benjamin is said to endow the rigors of nihil- ism with the special eloquence of sacred revelation,4 and for some at least the rewards of such a conjunction have seemed all but irresistible. Other readers have questioned the intellectual rigor of the negative side of utopia, of Benjamin's willful mixture of anarchistic nihilism and apocalypticism. For example, Jennings believes that Benjamin not only studied and critiqued the anarchist August Blanqui, whose "revolutiona- ry fervor comes close, in fact, to an advocacy of revolution for its own sake," but also that because of underlying affinities with Blanqui, Benja- min's remarks retain "something of a confessional tone."5 Kittsteiner also sees Benjamin "fascinated" by Blanqui, perhaps because they deemed the dialectical antithesis of the Messianic age, the sphere of redeemed life" (Richard Wolin, Walter Benjamin: An Aesthetic of Redemption [New York: Columbia UP, 1982] 213). At first resolutely anti-political, Benjamin represented in the 1920s and 1930s "the 'anarchic breeze' of Jewish Messianism [which] blew fresh air into the house that Stalin built" (Anson Rabinbach, "Between Enlightenment and Apocalypse: Benjamin, Bloch and Modem German Jewish Messianism," New German Critique 34 [1985]: 122). Benja- min placed his hopes on a hidden connection between the profane order and the com- ing of the Messianic kingdom. This concealed link took the form of the anarcho-theologi- cal model of force expressed in both his "Critique of Violence" and "Theologico-Politi- cal Fragment." In the "Theologico-Political Fragment" Benjamin wrote: "The profane, therefore, although not itself a category of this Kingdom, is a decisive category of its quietest approach"; but added that though "the quest of free humanity for happiness runs counter to the Messianic direction," the misery and suffering produced by this quest can, like force, "increase another that is acting in the opposite direction, so the or- der of the profane assists, through being profane, the coming of the Messianic kingdom" (Walter Benjamin, "Theologico-Political Fragment," Reflections, ed. Edmund Jephcott [New York: Harcourt, 1978] 312). Later the "quietest" approach would take the form of a radical revision of Marxist ideas, which received its fullest expression in the notes of the Passagen-Werk. Here the "objects and structures of capitalist society ... [are seen] as phan- tasmagorias of a dreaming collective" (H.D. Kittsteiner, "Walter Benjamin's Histori- cism," New German Critique 39 [1986]: 202). Benjamin's hunger for utopia is fed by images which awaken the frozen life of objects, "through which the isolation of both individuals and generations is overcome" (Susan Buck-Morss, "The Flaneur, the Sandwichman and the Whore: The Politics of Loitering," New German Critique 39 [1986]: 133). In his last years, Benjamin moved back toward his earliest position. The myth of awakening and the theology of redemption assume their full nihilistic potential as Benjamin looks to "ca- tastrophe and a cessation of happening" as the only exit from historical process (Kittsteiner 213). 4.

Jennings 61.</page><page sequence="3">4 Benjamin: Fears, Anxieties, Consequences shared together what Benjamin called "mythical fear." By this Kittsteiner means that, instead of seeing history as anonymous process, Benjamin's Messianism attributes agency and guilt to history, thus transforming heteronomy into autonomy. Such a position is ideologically retrograde, especially since Benjamin was the great unraveller of historical myths of progress and eternal return. Invoking Freud's notion of fate, Kittsteiner comments: "The anthropomorphic notion of a 'punitive' history again gets in the way of what is really needed: to imagine the 'dark power of fate' as an impersonal one."6 I would add that Benjamin's nihilism seems psychologically retrograde as well. Aligned with the mythic fear implicit in anarchism, it is also replete with what Freud would call the aggressive and libidinal compensations of an anthropomorphic Divine justice. Readers have also questioned the later Benjamin's recourse to sym- bolic constructs and psychological phenomena, which stress an increas- ingly positive "prefigurement of utopia" at the level of consciousness without critically examining or accounting for "the antagonistic structure of [capitalist] reality itself."' Benjamin has understood phenomenologi- cal concepts such as phantasmagoria (collective unconscious dreams about commodities) and the rehabilitation of the aura (the investment of things with the capacity to return the human gaze) as premature harbin- gers of a new classless order. For Adorno, these concepts are ideologi- cally retrograde because of their reliance on Jung's notion of the collec- tive unconscious: "The notion of collective consciousness was invented only to divert attention from true objectivity. .... It should be clear and sufficient warning that in a dreaming collective no differences remain be- tween classes."8 In addition, Benjamin's recourse to the collective un- conscious leads to irresolvable theoretical problems. Kittsteiner observes that Benjamin finds a relation between Marx's notion of 'natural conditions' [capitalism as second nature] and 'dream sleep,' but he finds no theoretical resolution of this complex. One can only observe that it is precisely at this point that he [Benjamin] turns away from the economic structure of capi- talist society toward the conscious or rather the unconscious pro- ducer caught up in this society.9 6.

Thus the contents and conflicts of the individual un- conscious give way to the monolith of the collective dream - a pro- grammatic negation of individual psychological specificity. Adorno's criticism of Benjamin parallels Freud's rejection of Jung: insistence on collectivity refuses essential individual differences and internalized con- flicts; in Adorno's terms, psychosocial phenomena must be manifested in "alienated bourgeois individuals," not in a collective subject.'0 Many readers have seen Benjamin's use of the collective uncon- scious as an adjunct to his attempt to reorganize subjectivity and dis- pense with the mythic unity of the subject." But rather than a theoreti- cal advance, Benjamin gives us a disavowal in the guise of a theory: his theorizing of the unconscious deflects the reader's attention away from consideration of individual psychosexual conflict (including his own), and his rejection of individual difference allows him to disavow his own "will to make history" - even unconsciously. Benjamin's refusal to see history as it is, and the individual as he is, present what can be re- garded as genuinely retrograde tendencies in his thinking, for he ne- gates historical process and psycho-dynamic conflict. Hence, what is nameable (things and individuals) is negated, and what remains (the unnameable divinity) becomes the exclusive real. What then are the implications of Benjamin's Messianic history? Sub- mitting to Benjamin's own language and assumptions regarding uncon- scious life, and critiquing his writings from within sets important limits on what can be "read" and how. Stoessel suggests that "all who ascribe the direction of world events to providence, God, or God and nature, prompt the suspicion that they still experience these remote and ulti- mate powers mythologically like parents and believe themselves bound to them by libidinal ties."'2 A psychoanalytic commonplace perhaps, but there is little reason to assume Benjamin's exemption, and good reason to explore its relevance. A fresh psychoanalytic re-reading of certain pat- terns in Benjamin's writing, especially patterns associated with what I have called retrograde tendencies, might serve to illuminate somewhat his compelling, but profoundly ambiguous, notion of Messianic history. 10.

The disturbing political and cultural situation of Jews in Germany generated a deep psychological ambivalence for Benjamin, and our sensitivity to the psychological implications of that fundamental psy- chosocial opposition should illuminate certain patterns and retrograde distortions in Benjamin's Messianic history. This strategy will involve exploring Benjamin's ideological aggressions in both psycho- biographical and cultural contexts - that is, in recurring psychological paradigms, and in the social circumstances of German Jews during the early part of this century which played such an important role in shap- ing characteristic features of Jewish psychology. Both of these, seen separately and in relation, uncover what I take to be Benjamin's abid- ing need to render his own cultural and psychic losses undecidable, and help to clarify his equivocal and highly creative relation to authori- tarian interdiction, parental or otherwise. In order to elucidate these claims, I will first trace a preliminary out- line of Benjamin's Oedipal dynamics by reading a dream narrative (first written in rough form in "A Berlin Chronicle"), and then I will examine how particular tensions conveyed in this narrative also seem to govern Benjamin's early and important essay "On Language as Such and on the Language of Man." Since "On Language" is widely recognized as a prefigurement of most of Benjamin's intellectual and political concerns throughout the remainder of his life,14 a new psy- choanalytic reading might have significant implications for how we read his other work. In the paper's final section, I will trace, however suggestively, the relevance of my themes for other of Benjamin's texts. The portrait of Benjamin's political vision which eventually emerges 13.

German Jewry When explaining the psychology of Jews against the backdrop of non-Jewish culture, the psychoanalytic observer has to consider at least three interrelated frames of historical reference, each marking its own field of potential conflict. First, the Jew's ambivalence in the face of the traditional past; second, his elaboration of characteristic defense mech- anisms for coping with the present reality of the German host; and third, intra-group antagonism, apparent for example in conflicts be- tween Jews of different social status, educational level, and ideological perspective, as well as between Jewish parents and their children. Due to the peculiar dialectic between the powerful patriarchal legacy of Ju- daism and the politicization of conflict between Jews (inspired in part by a liberalism which, as Adorno noted, "had allowed the Jews proper- ty, but no power to command"'5), the Jewish father's assimilation into an anti-Semitic culture presented complexities of identity for father and son alike, and in certain respects made more dire the son's already diffi- cult Oedipal negotiation between identification and repudiation. Marthe Robert's observations about Freud's situation can be gener- alized to other Jews of the period. She describes the basic form of generational antagonism as "an antimony between the order to which an assimilated Jew aspired and the prophetic radicalism, rooted in the distant past, which impelled him to reject any compromise with estab- lished institutions."'6 Such a formative conflict cannot help but influ- ence the quality and resolution of psychological conflict at the individ- ual level - an association that perhaps becomes more apparent, and more in need of explanation, with members of socially marginalized groups, for whom oppression fundamentally radicalizes the choice be- tween submission and revolution. Even excluding Benjamin's reliance on Jewish religious thought, surely his heightened sense of Jewish marginality lent force to the extremity and unusual form of his "rejec- tion of any compromise": Messianic history. According to Sander Gilman, outsiders accept as reality "the mirage 15. Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, Dialectic of Enlightenment, trans.

On the one hand, the reference group extends the promise of equality if the outsider follows the established rules. "Thus outsiders hear an answer from their fantasy: Become like us - abandon your difference - and you may be one with us." On the oth- er hand, however, all attempts made by the outsider to identify with the reference group, to pass unnoticed, actually draw attention to the differ- ence, because being a native ought not require any special effort or culti- vated habit of thought - indeed, this is the very definition of native membership. Thus, according to Gilman, "the hidden qualification of the internalized reference group" says: "The more you are like me, the more I know the true value of my power, which you wish to share, and the more I am aware that you are but a shoddy counterfeit, an outsider."" This is the classic double bind of ethnic assimilation, and the common re- sponse is to repress the conflict and sense of injury rather than to acknow- ledge insurmountable differences and the costs of dissimulation. Disa- vowal always exacts its own price, of course. For example, the outsider of- ten defends himself against the realization of his own exclusion by proj- ecting the conflict (his difference) onto other members of his own group.18 Clear expression of this stereotyping mechanism is readily found in the grotesque example of Otto Weininger, himself a Jew. Following the racist subtext of conservative German characterizations, which program- matically feminized the Jewish patriarch, Weininger defined the Jew's es- sential difference as his feminine Otherness. In Sex and Character, a pro- Aryan and anti-feminist polemic on sexuality, Weininger wrote: Some reflection will lead to the surprising result that the Jew is sat- urated with femininity, with precisely those qualities the essence of which I have shown to be in strongest opposition to the male na- ture ... the Jew, like the woman, is wanting in personality; his fail- ure to grasp the idea of true society is [due to his lack of] a free in- telligible ego. Like women, Jews tend to adhere together but they do not associate as free independent individuals.'9 The fragmentation of Weininger's identity is manifest: on the one hand, he identifies with masculine Aryanism; on the other, because he 17.

In the encoded projection of his own innate difference onto the world, Weininger's sense of the feminine becomes not only an exten- sion of his conception of the Jew, but also a means of separating Weininger the man from the bad (feminized) aspect of his Jewishness. The claim is already hopeless, of course; Weininger has acceded to the German stereotype, and it is impossible to escape the blemish of womanliness (the new Other). As Gilman says succinctly enough, "The fragmentation of identity that results is the articulation of self-hatred."20 A second prominent form of the same stereotyping mechanism is the polarization of Western and Eastern European (good and bad) Jews. The recurrent desire of German Jews for protection from the German reference group, and their persistent vulnerability to racial an- xiety, found expression in the hatred and sense of superiority German Jews felt toward the Ostjuden [Eastern Jews]. Rudolph Loewenstein, a pioneer in the development of ego psy- chology, and a student of the social and psychological character of GermanJewry, approaches the structure of Otherness and its fragmen- tation of identity from the perspective of individual depth psychology. Like Gilman, he is careful to note that there is nothing essentially Jew- ish about this confused response to marginalization. He also believes, however, that unconscious repudiation and unresolved identifications at the level of the social affect Oedipal development. He writes: There are no specifically "Jewish" deviations in the evolution of the oedipus complex or of the castration complex, nor any "Jew- ish" mode of development of the libido. However, certain means of resolution of the oedipus complex and fixation at certain stages in the development of the libido do seem to occur more frequent- ly among Jews than Gentiles. In our opinion, these expressions are connected with the aggressive drives. And if there is anything peculiar to the Jewish mind, it would seem to be the special ways [the elaboration of defense mechanisms] in which the ego deals with the aggressive drives .... 21 Loewenstein also explains that when a Jew experiences injustice be- cause he is a Jew, affront can rekindle an infantile, often fragile, sense 20.

Loewenstein comments: "Feeling themselves different from other men, they adopt an attitude of superi- ority (and at the same time of inferiority) toward the ordinary run of mortals. Sometimes an infirmity may become a source of special pride and vanity, but it is never a calm untroubled pride."22 In this context, Loewenstein brings to mind the antinomy between assimilation and revolution that Marthe Robert raised in her discussion of Freud, in which the desire for rebellion finds natural accompaniment in a defen- sive identification with some chosen status - a strategy intended to al- leviate feelings of abjection and betrayal. Freud was himself no stranger to the idea of historical variability, even when dealing with psychoanalytic "constants" such as the Oedi- pus complex. Peter Gay has remarked that "one of the most promi- nent yet least regarded aspects of the Oedipus complex is its continu- ous traffic with culture."23 It is precisely this "continuous traffic with culture," modifying not the content of the Oedipus complex but the shape of its resolution, which provides Loewenstein with a foundation for his decidedly historical assertion that Jews tended to be neuroti- cally fixated on or unable to resolve Oedipal conflicts because of their place in German society. As Gay remarks, Freud observed a similar failure in Viennese Jews who denied and overcompensated for their Jewishness: "The victim of self-hatred reflects his inability to give up either an intense hostility to his father or an indissoluble identification with that father."24 Jean-Francois Lyotard, while commenting on Shakespeare's Hamlet, theorizes that the specifically Jewish contribu- tion to the shape of the Oedipus complex is marked by two features: the deferral of a final vision reconciling the son and father (based tradi- tionally on the second commandment prohibiting icons of God), and the emotional vise in which the voice of the father holds the son, because the son knows unequivocally that the father's place is unattainable ex- cept by imitation ("Thou shalt have no others before Me"). Lyotard calls this aspect of Shakespeare's play "the dimension of nonfulfillment."25 22. Loewenstein 156. 23. Peter Gay, Freud for Historians (New York: Oxford UP, 1985) 96. 24.

In summary, we can say that the anti-Semitic structure of otherness, the non-resolution of Oedipal conflict, the defensive identification with chosen status, and the authorizing sanction which Oedipal irreso- lution discovers in the traditional notion of the Jewish godhead are fea- tures that mark in a general but nonetheless valid way the psychologi- cal character of the Jewish response to powerlessness and oppression. There was little in the objective historical situation of German Jews in the 19th and early 20th centuries that offered much hope of an alterna- tive, more positive response. In fact, any account of European Jewish history must hold as a founding premise the recognition that although Jews were permitted to own property, they had no power over their political fate - a thesis affirmed by both Adorno and Arendt. It is from this objective and essentially socio-political core of European Jewish experience that the discussion of the Jew as "castrated" derives, and all the psychological consequences which we have described above ultimately stem. Though the Jews of Benjamin's generation were among the first to acknowledge their exclusion and to "cease striving for identification with that group which has labeled them as Other,"26 I intend to argue that, in Benjamin's case, the opposition be- tween assimilation and revolution is actually a chiasmus, that there is an underlying intersection between these opposed tendencies, and that repudiation of the goals of assimilated Jewry does not necessarily signal liberation from the matrix of Jewish psychosocial conflict. Arendt's The Origins of Totalitarianism asserts that Jews were still entan- gled in the old feudal order well into the 19th century, and that as a re- sult their fate needs to be understood primarily in terms of state struc- ture and family organization, and only secondarily, if at all, in terms of class struggle. They sought and received protection from the surround- ing population and local rulers by contracting alliances between their own monied families and official structures of power, "no matter what these governments or states might represent."27 Standing in the way of industrialization and capitalization, they formed a middle class without fulfilling either the political or productive functions of a middle class.28 Modern Literary Theory (Albany: SUNY Press, 1982) 35ff. 26.

Their withdrawal as a group not only helped to ensure that the sover- eign-father remained a perdurable aspect of the Jewish heritage, but also promoted a political anti-Semitism that drew strength from the fact that "the Jews were a separate body."29 The father, thrice affirmed in the Jewish cultural imagination by religious (God), state (King), and family (Patriarch) structures, thus becomes part of a general psycho- historical bedrock not easily undermined, even by the castrating fea- tures of Jewish subservience and racist stereotyping. During the latter half of the 19th century - the age of economic ex- pansion ("the Golden Age of security") - the Jewish middle class be- gan to expand. With this expansion came a shift of emerging middle- class professionals away from state banking and business toward a bur- geoning Jewish intelligentsia. These were the first Jews, according to Arendt, to experience occupational or social discrimination as well as political anti-Semitism. But neither the fathers (accommodating and successful businessmen) nor the sons (the first generation of German Jewish intellectuals) were able to change the essentially powerless situa- tion of Jews as a group. Arendt notes: This might have been the moment for them to show that they actu- ally wanted money for money's or for power's sake. .... they might have entrenched themselves more firmly in state business and fought the influence of big business and industry on governments. ... [But] the sons of well-to-do businessmen ... deserted their fath- ers' careers for the liberal professions or purely intellectual pursuits they had not been able to afford a few generations before.s0 Yet in the face of social discrimination, the sons in one respect fol- lowed their fathers: they sought protection and "exception to the rule of discrimination." They invented a new myth of "world citizenship" to conceal from themselves their "social homelessness." It was in the context of this vague, unbordered notion of an international society that "national prejudices no longer seemed valid."31 In the "Golden Age of security," when effective political action militating for civil 29.

Both movements were primarily educational endeavors, oriented toward helping the Jew regain a secure sense of self, and prosecuting anti-defamation cases on an individual basis.34 By no means were they solutions to the problem of Jewish difference and powerlessness within German society, however. The question then be- comes: Did Benjamin's early theological radicalism or later religious- revolutionist thinking present any sort of real solution? With the advantage of hindsight, we can answer definitively: No. These positions were in fact only another form of fatal blindness. This raises a second question: Is our conclusion only a matter of hindsight, or does it say something further about Benjamin's failure to see, rather than his not being allowed to see by circumstance or necessity? Fietkau observes that "Max Weber raised his voice in warning against the revo- lutionary posturing in Munich in 1918," linking his denunciation of World War I "to a sociological analysis of present and future trends under the headings of mass democracy and bureaucratization."35 While the radical left, represented by Bloch and Benjamin, fantasized about theology and anarchism, and then attempted in the 1920's to 32.

It also proved unable to ac- count for the realities of middle classes "which were in no way prole- tarianized," or masses "who have long since taken a different turn" to- wards the reductive National Socialist polemic of blood and soil in re- sponse to massive inflation, postwar trauma, and social disorder.37 What becomes increasingly clear is that Benjamin lived his intellectual life in the realm of the uncompromised wish, beginning in 1916 with "On Language," and continuing into the twenties with the revolution- ary eschatology of "Critique of Violence" and his Marxist turn. His fantasy rejected as bourgeois any attempt, realistic or not, to cope ei- ther with the situation of Jewish otherness or with social conditions (elucidated by Weber) that allowed paranoid, racist caricatures of Jews to flourish. Precisely when the opportunity arose forJews to play pow- er politics, Benjamin became an esoteric intellectual with a resolutely anti-political ideology. When the objective preconditions for social rev- olution had passed, Benjamin merely entered into an internecine intel- lectual dual with other Marxists. It is possible therefore to see both assimilationist and revolutionary tendencies dovetailing in the Jews' fatal blindness to the role of the Other that domination had fated them to play. For Benjamin, the blindness took the form of a failure to recognize his own participation in the double bind by using Judaism as a weapon against other Jews. Benjamin's keen awareness of his Jewishness, beginning with his Jew- ish revival from 1909 to 1913, was a repudiation of Jewishness as de- fined by German-Jewish culture (liberalism and Zionism), but one which also trafficked in the stereotyping mechanisms - the essen- tializing of Judaism, the categorizing of Jews into good and bad - which defined the conflicting nature of assimilationist culture. Rabinbach for one fails to take account of this last point. He finds in Benjamin's letters to the poet and writer Ludwig Strauss "a clear and 36. Fietkau 170. 37. Fietkau 170-71.</page><page sequence="14">Beth Sharon Ash 15 sensitive attitude towards the issue of Jewishness as early as 1912."38 However, the language of the letters should alert us to the encoded myths that govern what can be said. As Rabinbach notes, it was Strauss who argued against the liberals in the pages of Kunstwart, claiming that "the liberals had denied 'the national substance in German Jews' and argued that there was a 'Jewish nationhood' evident in 'an inner differ- ence' that inhibited assimilation and made the Jews appear 'alien' and unacceptable.""39 In his early letters to Strauss, Benjamin is in perfect accord with Strauss's meta-myth that the Jewish people are mysteri- ously and metaphysically different from other people. He responds positively to Strauss, saying: "Precisely for the Jewish question we need an area where the Jewish spirit can be isolated and reveal its na- ture." Benjamin concurs that Jews should have a forum to express this pure Jewishness, forJewish religious life is "inadequate."40 But there is not a hint of suspicion that the affirmation of a mythological inner pu- rity is both the effect and the invariant catalyst of a mythmaking anti- Semitism. The fault encoded by the racist German subtext is negatively or antithetically recoded as inner purity. And as if to remind us that the unconscious pain of difference is still operative in this negation, Benja- min rejects Strauss's Zionism and projects his own sense of alienation onto the Eastern Jew. So radically other is the Eastern Jew to the West- ern Jew that a state comprising the two would be tantamount to natu- ral cataclysm. Benjamin asks rhetorically: "Is the unification of two cultures, like the west- and eastern Jews not something like a Salto- mortale in the natural, in chaos." Finally, as if feeling guilty for having isolated the Eastern Jew in so categorical a manner, Benjamin adopts for himself a position of false nationality, neither German nor Jewish: the Western Jews, he tells Strauss, "are committed to International- ism."41 With this comment, we can almost anticipate Benjamin's total rejection of Strauss in 1913. What emerges from the Strauss letters is the extremity of Benjamin's inclinations, even early in his career, as if society in any form could no longer contain the polarizations Benjamin employs when thinking 38.

On the one hand, all Jews with whom he enters into discussion - the liberal, or the moderate or political Zionist - do not know what the true nature ofJewishness is, and must be repudiated. On the other, the Western Jew is given world citizen- ship in order to stave off the dissolution that must occur when Eastern and Western Jew meet to form a state. The impossible ideal counter- acts the fantasized chaos. Thus, the structure of otherness does not change, though the heightened nature of the social conflict and its un- conscious determinants becomes more apparent. In this environment, Benjamin's failure to resolve basic Oedipal en- tanglements with his own father becomes both more plausible and more relevant. Perhaps the real father was but the first in a long line of assimilationists to be denounced for their wealth, their capitulation to bourgeois values, their tepid religiosity. Torn between hatred of and identification with different aspects of the father, this failure of resolu- tion might well have led Benjamin to develop fragmented, isolated im- ages of strong and weak patriarchs, to assert the ideal of the powerful god in order to devalue the flawed but no less exacting psychological reality of the powerless human father. One's private representations of God, as the analyst Ana-Maria Rizzuto claims, are dependent on parental imagoes that coalesce in early childhood,42 a process that can be both complex and self-contradictory. God was given to Benjamin as absolute. Gershom Scholem confirms that "Since we both believed in God, we never discussed His 'existence.' God was real for Benjamin ... the unattainable center of a system of symbols. .. ."43 But Benjamin's Jewish father became a figure of ques- tionable potency: Benjamin believed both that his father's patriarchal rights were provisional, and that he, the son, owed his father nothing. "Benjamin declared that people like us had moral obligations only to our own kind and not to the rules of a society we had repudiated."44 Scholem demonstrates the contradiction Benjamin produces by endors- ing the "absolute value" of the Ten Commandments for "us," while also undermining them dialectically. After all, it was Benjamin who plainly told his friend Scholem that they "had a right to exploit" their parents.45 42.

All of which suggests quite strongly that the extremity, and perhaps the contradictions, of Benjamin's posi- tion testifyfirst of all to the depth of his disappointment in his father. There seems to be a palpable continuity between Benjamin's re- sponse to other Jews and his relationship to his father. Both are de- nounced, because each is held in some way responsible (at least uncon- sciously) for the son's acute sense of betrayal. Father and son constitute the paradigmatic dyad of an intra-group conflict wherein assimilationist and revolutionary cannot be disentangled: acting out their mutual be- trayal, they only reinforce the psychosocial double bind created for them by the reference group. For his part, the son unconsciously blames the father for conditions the son is helpless to change, or which can only be altered in wish-fantasy. According to Benjamin's extreme version of Messianic history, nothing short of an impossible and inex- pressible perfection (the lost paradise of humankind's childhood), inexplicably returned to us by Divine justice, will suffice. Jewish Fathers and Mothers: Ghosts in "'A Berlin Chronicle" The express intention of "A Berlin Chronicle" (1930) is critique of the hegemonic discourses of German culture and bourgeois (Jewish) authority. The piece eschews naive, direct representations of autobio- graphical experience by relying on creative memory, dream-transla- tions, tales of terror, and invocations of the uncanny, wherein hetero- geneous experiences are realigned in a revolutionary constellation as warning signals designed to jolt the spectator from ideological slum- ber. But the essay is a psycho-cultural chronicle as well. Benjamin's re- lation to the experience of Jewish otherness is a source of anxiety which he would rather leave dormant, but which nonetheless finds ambiguous expression in his text. As Pinsker has said, Jews not only suffer their own special sense of the uncanny, but also represent it for others: "Thus the world saw in this people (The Jews), the frightening form of the dead walking among the living."46 Such apparitions are generally held in limbo by the dominant social order, persisting as a people long after anti-Semitic violence should have altogether eradi- cated them. They can be shockingly alien to those who regard them, and sometimes appear so even to other Jews. 46.

The son, coerced by the father to side with the oppressor, finds himself positioned to discredit both the op- pressor and the (actually disenfranchised) father. The father considers himself a member of the great league of fathers, but the son knows bet- ter: because of race and history, the relation of Jewish fathers to power is inherently problematical. Walter tests the limits of Herr Benjamin's authority by stressing the fundamental insecurity of the Jewish patri- arch's place in German society. Herr Benjamin's "stubborn" and "self-confident" social success is contrasted with the "sinister" charac- ter of his business;47 and his fief, Walter reveals, is actually "a ghetto held on lease" (BC 10). Paternal tenure seems at best provisional, at worst malign: a fake and sinister authority. As a child of seven or eight years vacationing in his father's luxuri- ous residence near Potsdam, young Walter has a dream, which is later related by the forty-year-old Benjamin in "A Berlin Chronicle" - al- though his retelling takes the de-authorizing form of an oddly "con- tentless" prophetic memory. Benjamin's account of his childhood dream is illuminated by the idea of Jewish paternity, and by the com- plicity between cultural and parental authority which the son seeks to discredit as an illegitimate conspiracy. The narrative recounts the pro- phetic dream, and then tells of the actual theft of his father's property, the provisional symbol of his social power: A ghost had appeared to me. The site of its operations did not, in exact truth, really exist, but had nevertheless a very strong resem- blance to one known, tantalizing, and inaccessible to me, namely the comer of my parents' bedroom that was separated from the rest of the chamber ... and in which my mother's dressing gowns ... were suspended. The darkness behind the curtain was impenetra- ble, and this corner was the sinister, nocturnal counterpart of that bright, beatific realm that opened occasionally with my mother's linen cupboard, in which, piled up on the shelves, edged with white trimming and bearing a blue-embroidered text from Schiller's "The Bell," lay the sheets, tablecloths, napkins, and pillowcases.

These were the hell and para- dise into which the ancient magic of hearth and home, which had once been lodged in the spinning wheel, had been sundered. Now my dream had risen from the evil world: a ghost busying itself at a trestle draped with a profusion of silken fabrics, one covering another. These silks the ghost was stealing. ... it did nothing with or to them that was actually visible and distinguishable, and yet I knew it stole them, just as in legends people who discover a spirits' banquet know that these dead beings are feasting, without seeing them eat or drink. It was this dream that I had kept secret. (BC 54) On the night after the dream, the home of Benjamin's father is vandalized, as the young prophet had foreseen. His father, "armed only with a pocketknife," must be restrained by his mother from con- fronting the thieves. The final narrative statements of the "Berlin Chronicle" episode concern, first, the eventual apprehension of the burglars ("It emerged [much later] that their organizer, a murderer and criminal ... was a deaf-mute"); and second, Benjamin's sense of pride in having prophesied (though mutely, only to himself) this viola- tion of the paternal home. He writes: "What made me even prouder, however, was the question why I had kept silent about my dream, which I now, of course, narrated at length as a prophecy" (BC 54-55). The Oedipal content of the dream seems clear enough: the son takes guilty pleasure in a wish-fulfilling dream by "busying" himself among the silken dressing gowns in the darkest recesses of the bedroom (the mother's sinister "corner"); he is himself the invisible, ghostly criminal at the banquet. The chain of metonyms, carefully placed by censoring dreamwork and, later, by artful recollection, are presented in contigu- ous proximity - ghost-criminal, murderer, deaf-mute - and allowed to suggest the absent Oedipal son by representing his parricidal intent. His guilt shifts the action to other agents while relentlessly stigmatizing them as powerless before the law: the ghost's pleasure is immaterial; the criminal is caught and suffers further retributions, as if the congen- ital curse of being both deaf and speechless were not enough. There is an additional suggestion of guilt in Benjamin's insistence that even the ghost does nothing visible. Viewing his fantasy-theft with shame, he writes to hide the traces of desire. It is an odd and self-cancelling ac- count, at once the confession of injury and impotence, and the fulfillment of incestuous wish and prophetic power.</page><page sequence="19">20 Benjamin: Fears, Anxieties, Consequences Yet a simple Oedipal reading of Benjamin's dream ignores ethnical- ly overdetermined elements that modify in crucial ways the clear Oedi- pal components of the dream. Social context deforms family dynam- ics, and overdetermines certain features of the Oedipus. For example, the incestuous wish for the mother is relinquished, not in favor of a strong paternal identification, but in favor of the appropriation of the mother's role by the son, who then inverts her conventional virtue of or- derly domesticity. Also, the displacement of parricide (the primary wish of the dream) ultimately avoids the castration threat rather than resolving the Oedipus. Refusing his parents' ambiguous roles as bour- geois German Jews, Benjamin adopts the difficult identity of uncreated son, which includes the critical job of self-narration. These complicating features are embedded in a fitting context, the German Jewish intertextuality of Schiller's poem "The Lay of the Bell," which the dream account has embroidered on the family linens. Benjamin directly parodies Schiller's poem, a conservative Germanic reaction to the French Revolution and paean to domestic peace and the "instinct of the Fatherland." Since we also find evidence in the dream of ethnically overdetermined, unconscious aims, however, any interpretation which would seek to describe the parodic dream as a simple overturning of sentiments expressed by the German poet can- not be adequate to the dream text. "The Lay of the Bell" is the source of a series of maternal images re- peated in the dream account: the wardrobe, the linen cupboard, and the spinning wheel. In Schiller's poem one reads: "Her home is her life/ In its circle she rules . . ./ Locks the chest and the wardrobe, with lavender smelling/ And the hum of the spindle goes quick through the dwelling." Schiller's poem also provides Benjamin with a Germanic representation of a spectral presence stealing into the home. "O daughter of the skies [maternal, domestic order], / Hail, holy order, whose employ / Blends like to like in light and joy - / Builder of cities, who of old/ Called the wild man from waste and wold./ And, in his hut thy presence stealing, / Roused each familiar household feeling; / And, best of all the happy ties, / The centre of the social band - / The instinct of the Fatherland!"48 In "The Lay of the Bell," revolutionary terror reigns momentarily; the mother, in fact, is killed ("She dwells within the 48. Friedrich Schiller, "The Lay of the Bell," Works of Schiller, Vol. 4 (New York: John W. Lovell Company) 223-34.</page><page sequence="20">Beth Sharon Ash 21 shadowy land, / Who was the mother of that home!"). But mother and country are also redeemed by maternal apotheosis. The underlying spirit of domestic order prevails when the country is at last reunited in love. Maternal right is triumphantly married to paternal law, and both princi- ples are transcendently figured in the bell as it rings a perpetual peace. In the dream, the paternal house is accommodated to Schiller. As Scholem says: "For the Jew who had lost his self-confidence, Schiller's program seemed to promise everything he sought; the Jew heard no false tones in it ... the Jews did not, as happened often enough, 'have the wrong address."' 49 The ghostly son of Benjamin's dream knows the address, and will concede no illusions about its true significance or his purpose there. For Benjamin, the aura of the bourgeois household dedicated in Schiller's name is strictly ersatz. Benjamin represents Jewish patriarchal stability as based on a precarious, in fact undecidable, relation to Ger- manic ideological illusion, and rejects the paternal claim to a happy home and castle. Would it be right to conclude that Benjamin's strate- gic use of Schiller's text generates this representation of the fantasized bourgeois household - that history, thus conceived, is merely a dream of the son's imagining? Is it not also true that the bourgeois fantasy of life here represented actually produced Schiller's text - that history is also the fiction of deluded fathers? Which is the true address, a mytho- logical inscription or a fief held on lease? For Benjamin, neither is "true." There is only this strangely personal, cunningly artificial critique of an undecidable relationship between fantasy and replication - the socially sanctioned violence of both German and Jewish fathers which is violated in turn by the son. Forced by the father to begin life at the side of the oppressor, the son ultimately disenfranchises both the Ger- man patriarch (Schiller) and the Jewish "father" at once. Benjamin is deaf to Schiller's bell, though his deafness may in fact indicate how sensitive he is to the charms of these ideals. The criminal in the dream cannot tell if there is anyone at home, but proceeds by shattering what was for him always divided: the simulacrum of a uni- fied home and nation. His relation to the mother is represented nei- ther as a longing for fusion with the primordial nor as a yearning for the marriage of sundered elements, but rather as part of a continued cosmological strife - the rending into heaven and hell of the already 49.

Dannhauser (New York: Schocken Books, 1976) 79.</page><page sequence="21">22 Benjamin: Fears, Anxieties, Consequences sundered (ideologically bankrupt) domestic peace, without hope of a final reconciliation. Benjamin revises Schiller's symbols so as to articu- late his own destructive identifications: Schiller's benign "presence stealing" is Benjamin's vandalizing ghost; Schiller's maternal spirit ("holy order," "daughter of the skies") is Benjamin's unholy specter of disorder devastating the fatherland. For Benjamin, the object of incest, the mother, is not principally an object of the son's desire, but only of his desire voided; she becomes the vehicle for his aggression, an unho- ly disorder, whose image the prophetic son commandeers in his rebel- lion against the father. In this way, the mother as object of desire is merely appropriated, voided as object, and made a functionary of the son's larger program of critiquing authority. Most likely this response to Schiller would have been less elaborately configured and violent had Benjamin identified with his father more positively. In the son's estimation, moreover, the Oedipal object of de- sire, the mother, has become merely a voided effect of patriarchal de- sire, merely "a profusion of silken fabrics, one covering another." Unlike the Oedipus or Hamlet stories where the father really, even lecherously, desires the mother, here the son sees the mother as mere- ly a foil - the surface finery - for the family's obeisance to the rule of material consumption, to the father's desire to be a good German. The mother becomes the social surface which proves the father's "social" virility - his wealth - and thus confirms that virility as a sham. Her ethereal presentation disallows other possibilities as well. Because she is represented as disembodied, Benjamin cannot possess her physical- ly. By virtue of a parodic technicality in the paternal Law, he cannot be arraigned as an incestuous son deserving castration. He violates the father's prerogative without truly violating the mother's body - ex- cept insofar as he devalues her relation to the father, voids her as a sub- ject and replaces her with his own desire, and appropriates what he then expresses as her latent destructive and anarchist spirit. In other words, Benjamin does not challenge the father in order to make full claim on his mother's affection; instead, he disavows Oedipal desire al- together in order to liberate himself from bourgeois constraints. Thus, aggressive desire aims through the parental imagoes to disrupt their au- thoritative hold on the unconscious. It is easy to imagine how aJewish child in Benjamin's Germany might find it immensely difficult to disentangle himself from Jewish parents who have been made to seem like impotent and alien figures - parents</page><page sequence="22">Beth Sharon Ash 23 who, as heterogeneous representations, give the equivocal appearance of being both Jew and German, and neither Jew nor German, at the same time.50 A sado-masochistic tension can emerge in the child's style of relating when the parent provokes the child's antipathy: hating him- self for hating his parent, he will repress his parent's ambivalent and ambiguous Jewishness, and thus the object of his hatred, only to have both return to him in altered form as something unheimlich. And it is precisely this sense of the uncanny, the unwelcome return of one's re- pressed self, which structures the dream narrative - both its strategy of ideology critique, and its ultimate program of destruction. Benjamin's program of familial destruction reveals a self-contradicto- ry relation between patriarchal "life" and its "text." But it also asks us to consider the dream as a deconstructive scene of writing which repeats the same ambiguous opposition, where one pole (life) feeds upon the other (fantasy), where fantasy is dependent on life and neither is a true limit or a substantial opposition. Life is generated as the product of a dream representation and then recalled oracularly as a crime that will occur in the night to come. Nothing is stolen in fantasy; but of life one can paradoxically say that nothing is left, nothing that is not pre-figured or after-imaged. By composing a dream account that spares its own fulfillment, Benjamin escapes parental threat and becomes the self-cre- ated prophet of paternal de-authorization. He enacts his crime through the theft of meaning which de-signifies castration by suspending it in the undecidable representation, the unbroken mirror of a dream. Adamic Naming Reconsidered Benjamin's early essay "On Language as Such and on the Language of Man" (1916), widely recognized both for its canonic importance and im- penetrable style, is driven by an ingenious interplay between aggression, ambivalence, a deeply held sense of lost perfection, and an inadequate but insistent desire for restitution through grandiose mythmaking. "On Language" tells an Oedipal story in which something goes wrong. Because its protagonist is Adam, the story as rendered by Benjamin promises from the outset to have fundamental psychological pertinence. Benjamin intends to read Genesis I and II according to kabbala in order to develop a language theory. But any account of the Fall inevitably invokes the Oedipal story (whether rendered through 50. Arendt 61.</page><page sequence="23">24 Benjamin: Fears, Anxieties, Consequences linguistic signs or iconographic images), since it is a mythic version of the Oedipus: paternal prohibition, exile from the body of the mother/ Eden, and final contract between God/father and Adam/son. Benja- min's project has been described by David Biale as an intentionally pacifist critique of Buber's notion of Erlebnismystik [the ineffability of ul- timate experience].5' But Benjamin's psychological ambivalence gen- erates a confusion of pacific and aggressive content, primarily because the essay (whether judged as a language theory or as an example of "pacifism") is permeated with characteristically Oedipal anxieties. I will read the essay both as an example of a failed paternal identifica- tion, and as a primal (Adamic) instance of a "missed" or skewed Oedi- pal resolution that is disturbed by Benjamin's determined shifting among father, mother, and son identifications in an effort to escape psychological castration. In addition to Benjamin's ambivalence towards the father/God imago, circumstances surrounding the essay's composition help bring Oedipal content nearer to the surface. The essay followed from a letter that Benjamin wrote to Buber attacking the pro-war position of Der Jude, Buber's monthly Zionist journal. It is important to remember thatJewish leaders (such as Buber) were as much in favor of a German victory in World War I as German nationalists and political anti-Sem- ites. For Benjamin, protest against the war meant "slaying the fathers" (including Jewish fathers), or attacking a unified "patriarchal" posi- tion. According to Biale: The war would lead the Jews to Zionism as the new community and would teach them the mystical value of nationalism .. . It is significant that Buber adopted roughly the same prowar argument as the anti-Zionist [liberal leader] Hermann Cohen ... they agreed that Jewish support for German nationalism would lead to a peaceful world. ... [Buber argued that Zionism] had prepared the Jews for war by extolling the virtues of community, self-sacrifice, and desire for salvation of the Volk .... "In the tumult of the crowd we sensed our melody and suddenly community (Gemein- schaft) engulfed us ... As this experience (Erlebnis) was entrusted to us ... we were drawn to the war not despite our being Jews but because we were Zionists."52 51.

Biale 16.</page><page sequence="24">Beth Sharon Ash 25 For Benjamin, Buber's Erlebnismystik sanctioned violence under the pre- tense of a thinly disguised and preposterous fantasy that Jewish engage- ment in the war would make Jews acceptable to Germans. Benjamin must have felt that his place in a Jewish community driven by frenzied nationalism was like an enforced dwelling among the enslaved and vio- lent Shems. Indeed, the concept of Erlebnismystik represented for him the dark linguistic and ethical confusion of the Tower of Babel. In "On Lan- guage," he writes: "Signs must become confused where things are entan- gled. The enslavement of language in prattle is joined by the enslave- ment of things in folly almost as its inevitable consequence. In this turn- ing away from things, which was enslavement, the plan for the tower of Babel came into being. .. ."s3 An identification with Jews mesmerized by Buber's doctrinal mystifications of a Zionist Volk, nationalism, and war was for Benjamin deadly by virtue of its unbearable inauthenticity. Thus in the essay Benjamin develops the derogatory notion of a bour- geois sign, which is not only "invalid" and "empty" but also "something that can be approximately described as an 'over-naming"' (L 330). The propagandistic concept of Erlebnismystik epitomizes the idea, manipulat- ing people to join the ecstatic and violent Gemeinschafi, and presuming, according to Benjamin, an illicit independence from the catastrophe of the Fall. The bourgeois forgets the "injured purity" of signs, and effaces his responsibility for naming the injury to human language caused by sin, which is a symbol of God's justice inhering in language. Though one would reasonably expect to discover in the essay a terri- ble anger against the perverters of language, Benjamin's essay has been read to demonstrate just the reverse - his pacifism. In truth, though Benjamin was against the war, pacifism was not, according to Scholem, "the style" of either Benjamin's character or of his critique.54 His ag- gression is directed towards the signifying system of the persecuting fathers, and it gains force through a pacific or (phrased more accurately) an anti-political, filial and submissive, relation to the Divine Name. By positing an unreconciled Oedipus complex overdetermined by Jewish traits, we are able to see how "pacifism" and fierce anti-war sentiment ultimately serve, and disguise, Benjamin's assault on Jewish patriarchy. If Benjamin's struggle is with a decadent orthodoxy, his reliance 53. Walter Benjamin, "On Language as Such and on the Language of Man," Re- flections, ed.

Scholem, Walter Benjamin 24-25.</page><page sequence="25">26 Benjamin: Fears, Anxieties, Consequences upon the heretical, kabbalistic notion of divinity, the unnameable pos- sibility of the Name, is only fitting. Biale describes the Name's meta- physical prerogative: "The divine name [is] meaningless but meaning bestowing," he says, for God's word is equivalent to existence, but God could not have created the world by calling it directly into existence with concrete words, since God's language, by definition, is undifferentiated and infinite. ... All interaction between God and the world must be mediated by man. God is the "source" of language, but it is man who names objects and thereby "brings the world before God."55 For Benjamin, in agreement with kabbala in this respect, the Sacred Text provides the grammar of God's creative, undifferentiated word. According to one kabbalistic metaphor, the black inscribed characters of Holy Writ permit the Infinite Name, or, more properly speaking, its absence, to appear as the blank intervals or spaces in the text. This Jewish doctrine of the absent Name and of man's exterior and filial relation to it finds a contemporary analogue, though not an ex- planation, in Lacan's psychoanalysis. Lacan emphasizes that the hu- man name names the subject for the paternal Other, whose symbolic price for cultural affiliation is inscribed on the subject's body (circum- cision is the mark of the covenant). The Name of the Father (in kabba- listic theology the Divine Name) is the absent source of this indebted- ness, both making the child the beneficiary of culture through the pa- ternal agency (the third agent, as opposed to the mother/child dyad), and forever alienating him in a language system that bars him from re- turning to preverbal being. In Judaism, the proper name ties the child to God; Yahweh is the deity of exile, the first deity without a perma- nent abode, and exile reveals the true nature of reality to humanity ("the Hebrew word for exile - galut - is derived from the same root as the word for revelation - gillui"56). Thus, the Jewish interpretation of the Divine Name always displaces human commentary from the source instead of facilitating direct revelation (ousia). This exteriority empowers and disempowers the speaking subject, for even as it legiti- mates his commentary, it also opens his alienated, human 55. Biale 139. 56. Roy A.

We see this in his discussion of Adam's "blissful" filial relation to the Divine Name, Adam's seduc- tion by the Satanic word, and the consequences of the Fall into human history as "the decay of Adamite language mind." This decay corre- sponds to the slippage of the mediated human word, seen as either en- slaved and violent or overdetermined and empty. The process of Oe- dipal resolution, inscribed in the story of the Fall, is destabilized in Benjamin's account in several important ways. Benjamin's version of the story goes something like this. In the begin- ning, God's undifferentiated name became grammatically differentiated by Adam's own language; as he spoke, Adam inverted the original order of creation, as in a mirror. The "Let there be," "He created," "He named" of Divine creation becomes "Adam received the Divine Name," "Adam named creation," "Adam created language." Adam's language is, as it were, "analytical"; it is a commentary and an exteriority with re- spect to God's Name in which creation and knowledge are coeval. The only "thing" that Adam creates is language; but Adam's language, ac- cording to Benjamin, is also "perfect": he names the world as it is, with- out a gap between signified and signifier. Thus, Adam's language is, as Richard Rorty would say, a true linguistic "mirror of nature." Benjamin also tells us that God does not name the namer. No doubt this is God's primal mistake. Though Benjamin places Adam in a posi- tion exterior to God, he also believes that Adam may possess textuality as a pure possibility. This is what Harold Bloom would call the "gnos- tic" moment in kabbala, the defensive strategy which displaces the Di- vine origin and makes man less the interpreter than the creator of the literal meaning of the word first uttered. As such, Adam is endangered from the beginning by the temptation of narcissism. However, Benja- min does not concede Adam's potential for solipsistic notions of self- creation, nor the violence these require; instead he calls the namer 57. Lacan's theory of the subject also depends on a similarly alienated relation to the signifier. Andre Green writes: "The exercise of speech confronts one at once with this dialectic of exchange. The refraction of the signifier upon the speaker, the aston- ishment he experiences at what he says, the way the discourse eludes him, the gap be- tween the signified intention and the signifying discourse, between the expected and the heard, reveal that the speaking quality of the subject is constitutive of his alienation in discourse, in the dream and its interpretation" (The Tragic Effect: The Oedipus Complex in Tragedy, trans. Alan Sheridan [New York: Cambridge UP, 1979] 67).</page><page sequence="27">28 Benjamin: Fears, Anxieties, Consequences "blissful." Adam's knowledge is from the first not solely or primarily receptive, but active and transformative, because the freedom to bring forth the already existing (creation) is also the freedom to know, to pos- sess, to incorporate - all of which are synonyms for the possession and exercise of power. The happiness but also the duplicity of the word derives from this intersection of passive reception with an always already active knowing. Yet Benjamin seems to want to exploit this duplicity when he says "God rested when he had left his creative power to itself in man. This creativity, relieved of its Divine actuality, became knowledge" (L 323). Implicit in this is the notion that creativity, relieved of the burden of Godliness, might transform the condition of exteriority into an oppor- tunity for transgression. By renouncing or avoiding God's unbearable presence, or indeed by insisting that God withdraws of his own accord, Benjamin makes Adam free for autonomous creation without intolera- ble anxiety. Though Adam may blissfully forget that he is merely God- like, bliss as a narrative abstraction becomes an effective screen for the darker intentions of self-aggrandizement. Benjamin says that Adam names only "perfectly" and "essentially," yet much can go wrong in the process of syntactic inversion. Lacking the infinite essence of God and yet empowered linguistically to fix the es- sence of himself and of all creation, Adam might err out of presumption. Also, Adam must read what God intended indirectly through the me- dium of creation. Benjamin's linguistic mirror of nature begins to look more like a "mirroring" stage in Adamic development - more similar to the mental structure described by Lacan than to the perfect Ursprache intended by Benjamin. By substituting "mother" for the undifferentiated body of creation, and the specular or the body-ego for knowledge, we can interpret Benja- min's Adamic self-naming as a process in which Adam posits the body of the mother and names himself as body-ego. Just as in the mirror- stage, when the infant misrecognizes himself in the other (the mother) and, in his premature condition, posits a fictively unified self-representa- tion, so does Benjamin's Adam over-idealize his representational capaci- ties in order to mitigate any tax on his power to represent himself as unmarked and complete. Nature, it is imagined, desires to be named by Adam so that her "imperfect" and "mute thing-language" might be transformed into something pure. "The translation of the .., nameless into name..,. is therefore the translation of an imperfect language into a</page><page sequence="28">Beth Sharon Ash 29 more perfect one" (L 325). Not the namer but the referent lacks es- sence and needs Adam's phonic attribution to fulfill herself; thus, he gives nature what she lacks and, in effect, becomes her phallus. "The unspoken word in the existence of thingsfalls infinitely short of the nam- ing word in the knowledge of man. . ." (L 326, my emphasis). Himself complete, all that is brought into relation with him is raised toward a "more perfect" condition by submitting to his naming word. The specular naming of nature also has important consequences for Benjamin's interpretation of the naming of Eve. Benjamin explains: Of all beings man is the only one who himself names his own kind, as he is the only one whom God did not name. It is perhaps bold, but scarcely impossible, to mention the second part of 2:20 in this context: that man named all beings, "but for man there was not found a helper fit for him." Accordingly, Adam names his wife as soon as he receives her (woman in the second chapter, Eve in the third). By giving names, parents dedicate their children to God ... for the proper name is the word of God in human sounds (L 324). This highly selective condensation of discrepancies in Genesis is telling from a number of perspectives, but especially notable is how Benja- min unconsciously ventures a significant misreading with respect to his own theory of language genesis. Eve, he implies (albeit unwitting- ly), is the child rather than the wife of Adam, for she is named by him much as children are named by parents. Since God "forgot" to give Eve the chance to name herself, she is deficient in this respect: only Adam can name her. Like all of nature, Eve is mutely imperfect, but she suffers the added degradation of having no right name. Adam can- not seem to make up his "mind language" in her case. Which is her proper name, Woman or Eve? A nameless thing, an improper proper name, and a sound either without essence, or possessed of too many essences because improperly named, Eve figures the terrible possibili- ty that language has fallen even before the Fall. As the living sign of Adam's self-fragmentation, she represents what is overdetermined or empty, and thus becomes the object of Benjamin's dismay.58 58. In explaining Benjamin's demystification of the auratic mode of experience, Miriam Hansen notes how disturbing the image of the mother's body is for Benjamin, and relates the maternal figure to the emotional intensity that the gaze has for Benjamin. She also assumes, however, that Benjamin has so thoroughly demystified the fetishized object that he is somehow exempt from its disturbing power - an as- sumption I do not accept. See Hansen 212-15.</page><page sequence="29">30 Benjamin: Fears, Anxieties, Consequences Benjamin's misrecognition of Eve invites a second look at Adam's naming of nature in the mirror. Adam thinks he has named nature justly, unaware that in order to do so he first had to misrecognize her undifferentiated and unrepresentable body - her transcendency - as an insufficiency. Hence, her original defectiveness, which would intro- duce alterity into the creation and undermine the legitimacy of Adam's language-mind, must be healed. Adam's mirroring relation to Nature testifies to his participation in the natural condition of creation; and if Nature is originally deficient, then Adam is necessarily implicated in this lack. The mirror of language effectively replaces the mirror of na- ture, however, disavowing any reflected deficiency and any consequent sense of alienation. Through the power invested in a pristine language that refuses language's mediating character, Adam presumes his own intactness. Yet when Adam anticipates an integral naming of all things, including Eve, which actually turns into its opposite - a slip in mind language which violates the paradisiacal intactness of Adam's word - he also betrays his meconnaissance, the fact that he himself is indeed im- perfectly constituted (named) in the mirror. Woman (whether mother, nature, or Eve) has always already inflicted this narcissistic injury upon Adamic naming. Adam's unrepentant narcissism sustains itself by pro- jecting back onto the Other the self's insufficiency, thus ensuring the non-recognition of loss. Benjamin's narrative of Adam's disavowal culminates in a somewhat contradictory explication of mourning. He asserts a peculiar trust that "To be named - even when the namer is Godlike and blissful - per- haps always remains an intimation of mourning" (L 330). Clearly it is not the namer - "Godlike and blissful" - who mourns, for he ap- propriates the things of nature unto himself, losing nothing. Rather, it is that which is named that mourns. Benjamin explains that Eden needs and cannot replace the namer, who has given the animals "the nobility with which they leaped away," since he has given them a name (L 329). Once named, the things of nature "leap away" toward a more perfect nobility in alliance with the namer. Surely it is not the animals who mourn. The question becomes: Who remains to mourn the losses inflicted by the naming power of language? The answer presents a tell- ing inversion. Though one might expect Adam to mourn his loss of Eden through the intrusive interdiction of language, instead Benjamin presents us with a vision of Eden mourning both the loss of her crea- tures to Adam's power, and then the loss of the blissful namer himself.</page><page sequence="30">Beth Sharon Ash 31 Her mourning, Benjamin tells us, is her "muteness, [by] which we mean ... the deep sadness of nature" (L 329). The contradiction is clear: to be named always carries with it some element of loss or mourning, and yet we are told that a perfect unity exists between namer and named through language. Separation is at once affirmed and denied. One explanation, of course, is Adam's narcissism, which requires that all gain must exact a proportionate loss59; in this case, Adam's ap- propriation through naming actually empties out the body of nature. The process of completing and healing the maternal body is also, and perhaps more fundamentally, an act of rationalized violence and vic- timization. However, this is but one aspect of the narrative's complex, often involuted representation of victim and victimizer. Though Benjamin extols, and probably envies, Adam's mastery, his observation that "to be named" implies mourning is spoken, it should be remembered, from the position of a son who has been named. And not just named, but named as a Jew - which is to say, named by vir- tue of his Jewish mother. Thus, in trying to spare his protagonist the predicament of loss, Benjamin implicates himself as narrator. Himself named, he has suffered an injury. This is the narrative's unspoken be- ginning, the unwelcome truth it speaks against by concealing. His inju- ry is returned to the mother, his loss becomes hers, and she is left to mutely mourn his miraculous self-completion. In theory at least, fending off castration in this manner would require a perpetual reversal of the roles of victim and aggressor. This sort of en- mity towards creation is also a feature of kabbalistic dualism, a thinking that sees the world as a universe of death, separate from the transcend- ent "good place" of God. As in kabbala, so in Benjamin's story: Adam is "invested with the gift of language and is elevated above nature" (L 322), but Benjamin's text is also guided by privately exploitive desires 59. The idea of the exclusionary nature of narcissistic exchange has its origins in Freud's early understanding of libidinal dynamics, especially in the tension between object and ego cathexes. See "On Narcissism: An Introduction" (1914), Standard Edition 14. For more recent constructions relevant to the current discussion, see M. Guy Thompson, The Death of Desire: A Study in Psychopathology (New York: New York UP, 1985). Thompson notes: "The envious person, by definition, suffers from impotence due to his desire to possess another's possession: the object of the other's desire. Yet, the mere tension between desire and its failure does not automatically lead to envy unless the owner of the coveted object is held to be the cause of the subject's privation" (72). See also Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen, The Freudian Subject, trans. Catherine Porter (Stanford: Stan- ford UP, 1988): "By desiring what the other desires, the dreamer puts herself in the oth- er's place and in that sense kills her, annihilates her" (13).</page><page sequence="31">32 Benjamin: Fears, Anxieties, Consequences engineered to manipulate the mother in order to elevate the son above her. This makes the heresies of kabbala seem almost minor in compar- ison. Benjamin consciously works to master loss, but he unconsciously undercuts his own position. He implies and yet defers his own castra- tion by creating a shifting state of undecidability. Is Adam the object of aggression or the aggressor, victim or victor? "On Language" suggests that he is both at once, and neither in full. Adamic language clearly betrays its fallen nature, as it must. The kabbalistic theory to which Benjamin appeals places language in a po- sition exterior to God and therefore in a position susceptible to errancy from the beginning - as Adam's naming of Eve indicates. Yet Benja- min almost willfully neglects his original exteriority and marks the Fall, the culminating event in an already long history of blemished purity, as the end of perfection and the beginning of decay. This gesture marks just one of several idiosyncratic moments in his recounting of the Biblical story, which, by their unusual relation to one another, trace the outline of an informing desire. For example, we also notice that in Benjamin's account of the Fall, Adam is conveniently dropped from the text. He becomes the absent victim, while his pure language is subjected to violence by both Satan and man. As Benjamin says, in Satanic naming Knowledge of good and evil abandons name, it is a knowledge from outside, the uncreated imitation of the creative word. Name steps outside itself in this knowledge: the Fall marks the birth of the human word, in which name no longer lives intact, and which has stepped out of name language, the language of knowledge, from what we may call its own immanent magic, in order to be- come expressly, as it were externally, magic. The word must com- municate something (other than itself). This is really the Fall of lan- guage-mind. The word as something externally communicating, as it were a parody by the expressly mediate word of the expressly immediate, the creative word of God, and the decay of the blissful, Adamite language-mind that stands between them (L 327). Adam is traced only as a linguistic echo, "the decay of Adamite lan- guage-mind," and all attention is focused upon Satanic transgression, which Benjamin marks by saying, "The knowledge to which the snake seduces, that of good and evil, is nameless" (L 327). In this way, the es- say invites obvious questions, suggestive of another, perhaps more</page><page sequence="32">Beth Sharon Ash 33 profound, meaning. Whom does the snake seduce? How is Adam se- duced? How does Satan's pretense of perfection differ from Adam's? How does the Satanic "nameless" word differ from the Divine name- less word communicating itself in the muteness of things? (L 326) Once again, similarity and difference are never sorted out, as if this were the essay's unexpressed and perhaps unacknowledged raison d'etre. Benjamin consistently represses at least one feature of the story: Adam's guilt. Adam is not simply a passive victim; his language is not merely subject to decay through the transgression of others. Adam's vocalization of God's creation must destroy creation through oral re-cita- tion (knowledge is a kind of incorporation, however abstract). Adam's naming has been from the beginning a representation through which creation "no longer lives intact"; the sign differs from and defers pres- ence, since even before the Fall, the signifier of woman no longer signi- fies her perfectly. Benjamin never tells us that Adam eats of the tree; but in eating, Adam finalizes his crime of vocalization by rejecting God's ab- sence, repudiating his own exteriority to the absent Name, and attempt- ing to interiorize what will forever remain beyond him. The tree itself, as Benjamin does tell us, is the "immense irony" of emblematics in Eden. The symbol of the Law arrives prior to any need for it, and it can only be understood by Adam as either the emblem of God's symbolic Absence (a symbol that shall remain nameless) or a Satanic "question" - "the question as to good and evil in the world after creation [but before the Fall] was empty prattle" (L 328, emphasis mine). But one may justifiably wonder how Adam is able to identify which namelessness - Divine or Satanic - is emblematized by the tree and at what moment. Hence, the tree re-figures Benjamin's own ambivalence about the patriarchal man- date. Whether or not one accepts the psychoanalytic tenet that desireis synchronous with interdiction, Benjamin's God does in fact silently name Adam's desire by introducing into His creation the tree, a symbol of law without name (God) or name without law (Satan). To Benjamin the tree proffers contradictory commandments which, in their contradic- tion, describe an impossible wish: "You shall not name the unnameable because you are Adam," it seems to say, "but because you are also Satan, you will try to name Me anyway." The desire is the impossible one of becoming the Prime Namer. This parricide, this coup d'Oedipe staged by the snake, signifies Satan's linguistic assumption of the Father's role - Satan is the false embodi- ment of God or the "uncreated imitation of the creative name." But</page><page sequence="33">34 Benjamin: Fears, Anxieties, Consequences the snake is also the representative of Adam's (the son's) desire to name the Unnameable, which the son refuses to recognize because an overt filial respect demands its repression. By displacing his agency onto the snake, Adam introduces into the psychological order an es- sential disavowal of his repressed parricidal desire. Hence, as Lyotard claims, Adam "unfulfills his desire in representation," for Benjamin's Satan enacts what Benjamin's Adam denies. As Satan endeavors to ful- fill the parricide, he is "stepping outside" of paradise as well as "com- municating something other than" Adam's blindness - that is, Adam's wish. In this way Satan represents desire played out on anoth- er stage, apart from Adam the son. As with the earlier scene in which nature is named, this second psychodrama depends on misrecognition and projection, on seconda- ry satisfaction at a distance. The subject unfulfills his own desire in re- lation to God (he is innocent, not on stage), but from his position, all those who would fulfill his desire are actually Satanic imposters: usurp- ing sons or fake fathers (uncreative mimics and idle chatterers). Thus the primal perverter of the Name also seems to bequeath his legacy to the bourgeois sign; and Satan, the usurping son, suggestively recalls for the reader (if not for Benjamin) Buber and the other Jewish patriarchs, whose language is empty and violent. So long as he fails to recognize the narcissistic and aggressive impli- cations of his desire to name the Unnameable, Benjamin defensively positions himself to counteract aggression in the Other. He is a special son, for not only is he subject to the decay of Adamic language like everyone else, but he also submits to the Divine Word in its "injured purity." Identifying himself with Adam as a victim of injustice, Benjamin, the good son, knows what terrible wrong has been done to God by his false sons. Benjamin thus endows his own aggression against the Father with a narcissistic or "righteous" intonation. This is symptomatic of the larger Benjaminian patterns I have attempted to sketch, including his disavowal of responsibility for parricidal guilt and his displacement of parricidal aggression. Perhaps now it is possible to offer a synthetic description of the pro- cess of undecidability that underlies Benjamin's Adamic myth. In Adam's contradictory relation to the maternal Eden, we have uncov- ered the essential paradigm of irresolution. Benjamin the son, named and thus circumscribed by his mother, first avoids the implicit mater- nal appropriation of his potency. Thus Adam the namer is empowered</page><page sequence="34">Beth Sharon Ash 35 to appropriate the things of nature, and thereby to invert the feared scenario of loss and mourning. Rather than surrendering the fantasy of perfect completion to disappointment at the hands of a deficient (in- complete) maternal creation, Adam leaves nature mourning the loss of his perfection, the unity he sustains by absenting her. "All of nature would begin to lament," Benjamin writes, "if it were endowed with language.... Lament, however, is the most undifferentiated, impotent expression of language" (L 329). Even were nature capable of speech, it would only be to affirm her insufficiency. Here we have Benjamin's mythic devaluation of that which resembles him in its weakness. In the end, both Benjamin-Adam and Mother-Eden are arrayed in opposi- tion to themselves and to one another, at once deficient and complete, victim and aggressor, each role disavowing the opposite in itself and the same in the Other. This confusion allows Benjamin to sustain the undecidability of deficiency (castration) and terrible power, and to per- petuate their ambiguous relation to one another. In order for the strategy of undecidability to work psychologically, it must encompass mother and father together, not simply one or the other. Circumscription by a powerful father can be counteracted either through identification with the mother, or through displaced aggres- sion against the father which is disavowed. The first, simple acceptance of an original insufficiency is no solution. The second at once denies and enacts the patricidal wish, containing the threat of exposure and retribution without ever expunging it. Circumscription by a weak, feminized Jewish father is counteracted simply by refusing to identify with his perceived impotency, and by repudiating the Law (castration) based on this disappointment. In the end, all resistance hinges on the deferral of confrontation with or submission to the father's preroga- tive, on the delay of any resolution of the Oedipal contract. Benjamin's intolerance of parental limitation ultimately leads him to the refuge of an apocalyptic fantasy: the religious ideal of a powerful Father-God who would destroy all living fathers, both feminized Jew and sadistic German, and cleanse the psychological world of all contradiction through an unearthly counterforce. Thus Benjamin consigns himself to Messianic deliverance, unwilling to compromise with history, to relin- quish a deep-seated, multifarious, dangerous but necessary desire to at once escape castration and yet disavow complicity in ugly transgression. Benjamin's psychology functions as a kind of perpetual-motion ma- chine. Though Benjamin can assume any position - son, father,</page><page sequence="35">36 Benjamin: Fears, Anxieties, Consequences mother - castration awaits at each stop. As soon as the agitated parti- cles of identity begin to settle into an assignable position, the game is lost. The result is unstable, but the constant movement and blurring of identities enables the subject to upset the patriarchal order and escape the significance of the castration threat. No father has true authority, no son is ever subjugated, and no aggressor-mother is the object of de- sire (the loss of her is not something to be mourned). Also, no son commits parricide without injuring himself, and no mother escapes ei- ther degradation or replacement by the son, who has elevated himself to the position of the Father's favorite. Fathers are fake copies of the Father and therefore themselves little more than false sons. In this psy- chic confusion, which places all identifications in undecidable suspen- sion, Benjamin manifests both a conscious ambivalence toward vio- lence, which requires a masking of unconscious, violent impulses, and a compensatory narcissism, which helps him manage this misinterpre- tation of his injury. Benjamin's Adam also nihilistically revises the irreconcilable dis- tance between God and man in Judaism. For the killing of Moses, as Freud said, not only sacrifices the man in order to gain a demateri- alized, ethical absolute (the abstraction which is based on the repres- sion of this crime). But also the murder of Moses, as Lyotard adds, is "an acting out" which forgoes the Jews recognizing themselves "as the father's murderer and [which] cuts off the path of reconciliation, the one traced by the desire to see [the transubstantial image of Christ]; the Christian path which announces at its end the vision of the Father."60 Having murdered the patriarch, repressed the sacrifice, and com- pensated for guilt with a dematerialized God, the Jew thus defers his "final vision" of the father. Benjamin seems more than willing to make a totemic sacrifice of his human father, but only to defer reconciliation of the Oedipal contract rather than to submit to guilt for the crime. Though he is commanded by, and is under a powerful compulsion to accept submission to the Divine Voice, he translates the ineffable speech as his own message, an utterance concerned with the primal purity and secondary injury of language. Because violation supposedly comes from without, it is also subject to repair by Benjamin, a special son. Unconsciously, the message emphasizes that God and world must accept the losses that by law should have been this son's own. By 60.

Many critics have voiced objections to the Freudian schema, partic- ularly to the potentially totalizing power of parental images and their despotic subjugation of the psyche (demanding recognition as poten- tial castrators and models for identification). It is nevertheless easy to appreciate how Benjamin's dearth of balanced identifications (which might modify an uncompromising archaic wish) results in such an in- cessant confusion of paternal and maternal imagoes, causing the son's identifications and repudiations to remain archaic, split-off, and motile.61 For Benjamin, the patriarchal legacy of Judaism is a highly volatile and ambivalent inheritance. He devalues real fathers and ele- vates the Divine Father, but only insofar as God's donation of His voice (the absent name of kabbala) can be appropriated by Benjamin as a gnostic possession: his own private, mystical knowledge. Psycho-Political Coda The description Freud gave for the archaic personality is appropriate to Benjamin: he has a "tenacity of fixation," exhibits an "extraordinary propensity towards ambivalence," and maintains simultaneously "the most various and contradictory libidinal cathexes."62 My effort to ex- plore these split-off images and contradictory investments in Benja- min's psychology, and my description of his psychomachia as a perpet- ual effort to fend off castration, culminate in this final section in a dis- cussion of the reverse side of Benjamin's "rejection of any compro- mise" - what might be called the infinitization of desire, the desire to desire without impediment. Benjamin's loyalty to the code of non- fulfillment seriously affects how we might begin to read some of his the- oretical-political constructs in a psychoanalytic manner. Specifically, I will suggest how Benjamin's need to infinitize desire informs his two "progressive" alternatives: profane illumination, as defined in part by the dialectic of shock effect; and complete rupture with the past, or Messianic redemption. I will also discuss their concealed relation. The category of profane illumination might be said to contain, as one 61.

Adorno criticized Benjamin's faith in artis- tic media, particularly technological media, and his belief that the in- creased fragmentation of perception, brought about by modern urban life, could be used by film (for example) to provoke a qualitative tran- scendence of reified and dislocated consciousness.63 One wonders if shock effect might be open to the same criticism. Hansen thinks not: The cinema's promise of collectivity resides less in the miraculous conversion of economically motivated quantity into political quali- ty suggested in the Artwork Essay [Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"], than in the shock-like con- figuration, or re-figuration, of social documents - images, sounds, textual fragments of an alienated yet common experience.64 But we need to consider precisely what is "miraculous" about the dia- lectic of shock effect. If Adorno's criticism of Benjamin's faith in art can be transferred to his more sophisticated notion of shock effect, then perhaps this latter idea could be seen as an extension, or overex- tension, of Benjamin's "overly optimistic" program of transforming quantity into quality. Shock effect is a dialectical concept. On the one hand, Benjamin fol- lows Freud's description of anxiety by viewing shock as a defensive ma- neuver, a mechanism created by the ego in order to deter unpredictable stimuli in an increasingly intrusive environment. On the other hand, the formal rehearsal of this type of mental assault activates unconscious de- sire in such a way that it can be consciously recognized. Benjamin first uses the constitutive ambiguity of shock effect, in "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire," to describe the recognition of longing conveyed in "A Une Passante." The poem figures desire as a "catastrophe" of loss: in an en- counter at a distance with an unknown woman, who is mysteriously giv- en and taken away in an instant by the crowd, the poet, Benjamin tells us, is "spared, rather than denied, fulfillment."65 The effect is not only 63.

As Benjamin explains, it is "the kind of sexual shock that can beset a lonely man" (OSM 169). Baudelaire does not experience erotic "rapture," but rather a self-in- volved sense of injury and need. According to Hansen, it is through dialectical ambiguity that shock gains its strategic meaning, for it activates the unconscious wish-fantasy heretofore repressed by the ego's defensive armor and fragmented in conscious perception. Thus, it might be tactically reproduced by filmic devices such as montage and framing in order to generate desire that cannot and should not be fulfilled by objects. These refigured and dis- ruptive social images teach us to long for nothing less than collective transcendence. Yet what Benjamin specifically illuminates in the Bau- delaire essay is that the artistic rehearsal of shock effect should produce our private longing for a desire that must be "spared" fulfillment. In other words, the first aim of shock effect is to produce a large quantity of self-referential desire that cannot be fulfilled. The unbounded wish is released by the destructive consequences of a defamiliarization. Hansen looks at neither the quality of the wish (which has distinct narcissistic features), nor at the excessive quantity of desire that Benjamin thinks art can produce in the receiver. Moreover, she quick- ly annexes the primary destructive and desire-producing goal of shock effect to a second mimetic objective. But only when this second step is taken can Benjamin be justly accused of being "overly optimistic." We see this, for example, in what Hansen terms his "autobiographical" defense of Battleship Potemkin. Benjamin wrote: "The proletariat hero is the hero of those spaces whose adventures make the bourgeois ab.p- don himself with a throbbing heart in the movie theater, because he must relish the 'beautiful' even and especially where it speaks to him of the destruction of his own class."66 In "On Baudelaire," Benjamin works within the parameters of modernism by focusing on the de- struction of auratic experience, but in his defense of Battleship Potemkin he rehabilitates auratic experience on the unconscious level. In Benja- min's case, at least, an excessive quantity of desire has indeed caused him to fall in love with the qualitative prospect of transformation, with Eisenstein's beautiful image of proletarian life, but he does so primari- ly because of his desperate desire for an image that will return his 66.

It would be possible to claim from one point of view that the production of unfulfillable desire, the rigors of nihilism, are short-circuited by mime- sis, with the result that the hypnotic power of images, which make the bourgeois want his own destruction against his will, are overvalued. But from another, perhaps more trenchant viewpoint, the defense of Battleship Potemkin as essentially "miraculous" is clearly a denial of a realistic limit, a fetishizing of the image, and a valorization driven by unconscious desire that refuses circumscription. It would be wrong, therefore, simply to criticize the consequences of infinite desire - the overvaluation of the technical medium itself or the hypnotic effect of cinematic mimesis - without taking into account Benjamin's subjec- tive need to fetishize desire and to delay (indefinitely, infinitely) its fulfillment. For the medium, whether it is Adam's language of names or the capacity of Battleship Potemkin to rehabilitate the aura, is indeed invested with the narcissistic pursuit of perfection. In this way the me- dium is valorized without Benjamin (or his critics) having to own up to the psychological significance of profane illumination: desire spared its own fulfillment, the fetishization of forepleasure. That we desire without limit is also the cause of suffering and the ba- sis of theological hope. Profane illumination appears to be propaedeu- tic to Messianic redemption, for it holds open the empty space of de- sire, a space between fulfillment (the total break) and desire (for ob- jects) that is nourished and protected by art. Adorno noted critically Benjamin's religious refusal (as seen in Thesis IX, the "Angelus Novus") to look the revolutionary future in the face: You have swept art out of the corners of its taboos - but it is as though you feared a consequent inrush of barbarism ... and pro- tected yourself by raising what you fear to a kind of inverse taboo. ... we need have no fear of it [the revolution] nor need we ontologize our fear. ... It is not bourgeois idealism if... we main- tain our solidarity with the proletariat instead of making our own necessity a virtue ... .67 What Benjamin "feared," as Adorno sees so plainly, is fulfillment. Again we find Benjamin transforming his subjective need into a doc- trine (or using a religious doctrine to express subjective need). As 67.

Any revolutionary desire the proletariat could realize objectively would be by Benjamin's standards partial; ultimately the "quest for hu- man happiness," as Benjamin said in "Theologico-Political Fragment," is productive only of further suffering - a pathos demonstrating transi- ence. The dimension of total fulfillment always already inscribes for hu- manity the profane realm as the realm of non-fulfillment. Hence, the unnameable, imageless future may be an articulation of complete faith in the sacred as well as an expression of absolute pessimism about the profane, but it is also a Divine sanction for desire without limit. How then does the Messianic relate specifically to profane illumina- tion? Recontextualizing the "Theologico-Political Fragment," the ques- tion becomes: Does Messianic fulfillment act upon profane illumina- tion as "force" acts upon "counterforce," or, since humanity either does not or ought not have a realistic and progressive way of working toward the revolutionary goal within history, are the two unconsciously continuous with one another? Consider in what direction the "storm from paradise" is blowing. God's will comes from out of the human past - from the same direction as archaic desire. We are told, "this storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned."68 Why does the angel not look into the future? Some readers have thought that it is because revolution signifies, for Benjamin, a mis- trusted, because partial, fulfillment.69 But there may be a second reas- on. For Benjamin, the Messianic end also means the limit of human de- sire - the point at which the excessive production of desire will no longer be necessary or virtuous. For as long as the Messiah does not come we must continue to desire infinitely; circumscription, and re- sponsibility for deferral, has been transferred to a mysterious Divinity, and to the authority of a single future moment which cannot be earned or prepared for. Benjamin forthrightly (and with the sadism of a willful righteousness) asks his readers to want with and for him, to nourish and protect the empty space that conceals the unconscious depth of his (and therefore our) narcissistic disappointment.
