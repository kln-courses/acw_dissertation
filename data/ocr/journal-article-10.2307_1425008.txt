He received his Bachelor of Architecture (1963) and Master of Architecture (1966) degrees from Cornell University, where he stud- ied with Colin Rowe. In 1967 he received the Rome Prize Fellowship and studied at the American Academy in Rome for two years. He has received grants from Princeton University, the University of Maryland, The Graham Foundation, twice from the National Endowment for the Arts, and was the 1986 recipient of the Brunner Grant from the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. He is a former member of the JAE editorial board. Schumacher is a registered architect and has worked in the offices of Manfredi Nicoletti in Rome, Brown/Daltas in Rome, and I.M. Pei and Partners in New York. He was a Research Associate at the Insti- tute for Architecture and Urban Studies in New York. Schumacher has taught at several uni- versities, including Princeton, the Uni- versity of Virginia, and the Catholic Uni- versity of America, and is currently Asso- ciate Professor of Architecture at the University of Maryland. He has been a visiting professor at Carnegie-Mellon University, the Istituto Universitario dell'Architettura di Venezia, the Univer- sity of Illinois at Chicago and Temple University. He has lectured at Universi- ties in the U.S., Canada, Italy and West Germany. Thomas Schumacher's articles have appeared in various magazines and journals including Architectural Design, the Harvard Architecture Review, The Architectural Review, Casabella, and Oppositions. He is the author of The Danteum, A Study in the Architecture of Literature (1985), published by the Princeton Architectural Press. He is pres- ently working on a book and a video tape on facade composition, entitled The Palladio Variations, and on a mono- graph on the Italian Rationalist architect, Giuseppe Terragni. Virtually all the architects of the Modern Movement began their careers with one or another version of the Classical vocabulary. But unlike other Modernists, Terragni continued to use specifically classical forms and details during much of his career, rather than abandoning them to the more abstract modern idiom. Terragni's involvement with Classicism comes from a variety of sources: the heightened nationalism of both the Risorgimento and Fascism, the concept of Mediterraneanism-common to much of the Modem Movement-and the myth of the 'Masters of Como.' This Classi- cism manifests itself in a number of ways: in proportion, figure, parti-forms, com- positional regularity, cubic stereometry; but most importantly in the use of clas- sical detail-forms. But his sense of the "well-built" building, in the tradition of the great Lombard builders of the Romanesque period and later, is present in all his buildings and projects, in the International-Style works as well as in those designed in a Classical language. Terragni's buildings in "literal" Classical style each represent a variation on the work of a different major architect of the Italian Classical tradition. But it was in his less archeologically classical build- ings that Terragni succeeded in combin- ing all these influences and adaptations to produce a truly independent and orig- inal expression of his own. They are the Casa del Fascio in Como, the Danteum project and the Pal. Littorio Competition, solution "A." In these buildings the underlying substratum of Classicism that was Le Corbusier's, Mies's and Wright's shows Terragni to be yet another crypto- Classicist in Modern-Movement dress. "We find ourselves in between classicism, in the sense of a return to order, and neoclassicism, intended as a language inherent to the new order that Fascism wants to represent. Terragni's rational- ism is a 'true' classicism, based on purity, the absolute, proportion, mathematics, and the 'Greek spirit.' " Giorgio Ciuccil "The 'classical' for Terragni was vital knowledge, not servile imitation. He admired the organization of certain Egyptian and Greek buildings, certain plans organized with rectilinear walls of great thickness, in large blocks of stone.... As much as possible he used granite, with which he was fascinated, inserting it in vast blocks." Luigi Zuccoli2 Virtually all the architects of the Modern Movement began their careers with one or another version of the Classical vocabulary.3 Wright's Blossom House (1893) and Hardy House (1902) are good examples. Le Corbusier's Villa Schwob (1.916, the chef d'oeuvre of his Chaux de Fonds period), Mies' Kroller House, and Aalto's Jyvaskyla Workers' Club (1924) show attachments to the Classical lan- guage that were to reemerge at later stages in their careers as significant sub- strata.4 But unlike these other Modern- ists, Terragni continued to use specifi- cally Classical forms and details during much of his career, rather than aban- doning them to the more abstract mod- ern idiom. Perhaps this is attributable to the fact that Terrangi died at the tender age of 39, an age that Le Corbusier had not yet passed when he designed the Villa at Garches. Possibly Terragni did not live long enough to outlive his early influences. But when Le Corbusier and others of his generation abandoned tra- ditional vocabularies they never went back. Terragni tended to hedge; he designed buildings in the classical vocabulary (Fig. 1) after he had designed buildings in the International Style. Dan- iele Vitale has noted this influence, argu- ing that it was the Novecento strain of Classicism that influenced Terragni, an influence that ".. permeated his entire career, often delicately poised in a metaphysical atmosphere."5 Terragni's involvement with Classicism comes from a variety of sources: the heightened nationalism of both the Risorgimento and Fascism, the concept of Mediterraneanism-common to much of the Modern Movement-and the myth of the "Masters of Como." This Classi- cism manifests itself in a number of ways: in proportion, figure, parti-forms, com- positional regularity, cubic stereometry; but most importantly for our purposes here, in the use of Classical detail-forms.

Throughout his artistic career Terragni depended on images of various kinds, to the point where he was accused of plagiarism more than once.6 While I would not reduce Terragni's works to such simple terms as plagiarism, it is true that from his very first professional proj- ects (like The Monumento Ai Caduti, 1926, in Como, designed in collabora- tion with Pietro Lingeri, Fig. 2) to his last works he collected architectural themes upon which to make variations, using several sources for a number of distinct transformations. Terragni was influenced specifically by the history of Italy and Italian architec- ture over the two centuries preceding his own work, and he might be placed com- fortably in an "Apostolic Succession" of Italian architecture that runs through such important figures as Boito, Basile, d'A- ronco, and Sant'Elia. During late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries a dialectic between the new (i.e., foreign) ideas of [then] modern architecture, and the traditional values of Classicism, can be discerned in Italian architectural theory and practice. Ques- tions about the "imitative" nature of architecture versus a "natural" architec- ture separated such theorists as Lodoli and Algarotti as much as Blondel and Perrault. Foreign architects, after 1750, came to Italy to view old buildings, not the latest work of contemporary mas- ters. The seminal socio-architectural ideas of the late-eighteenth century also affected Italy. Even such elements as the Orders were given new significance, widening their meanings from icono- graphic and anthropomorphic associa- tions to include thematic content, the invocation of mood, and psychological conditioning.7 Another factor for Terragni was the myth of the Magistri Comacini. Terragni and his sometimes partner Lingeri, like all the architects from Como (including Sant'Elia), came under the spell of this myth. The Magistri (Latin), or Maestri (Italian)-"Masters"-were the legend- ary builders of the Como region, who were believed by some to all come from Summer 1988 JAE 41/4 ...... :' ....?

Cesare de Seta, for instance, introduced a discussion of Ter- ragni by referring to the Maestri: "In the land from where the ancient medi- eval maestri emerged to spread the seeds of the lombard language (of form) into Europe... Giuseppe Terragni worked and died...."8 Twentieth-century scholarship has placed the myth of the Magistri Comacini into a somewhat narrower perspective.9 To this day the builders of the region have continued to enjoy an immense reputation. The Comaschi in general are considered the most bravo and compe- tent of all Lombards, who themselves have the best reputation in Italy for qual- ity of workmanship and the capacity for hard work.10 Terragni, ultimately, was placed-even caught-between Medi- terraneanism and the Maestri Comacini myth, the one Italian and the other Gal- lic, the one representational, the other constructive, the one nationalistic, the other international. As Alberto Sartoris perceived it, the struggle also involved Modernism in its relation to the classical world. Accord- ing to Sartoris, Terragni believed he "... could connect the valid achieve- ments of Latinism to the Mediterranean and European avant garde... His posi- tion was therefore that of a premedi- tated rationalism capable of enriching, identifying with the international cur- rents of constructive art, through the sys- tematic metamorphosis of our styles."11 Terragni himself recognized this in print when he wrote "There is a clear and serene rationalism, most mediterranean, of certain Hellen- ized buildings, and a barbaric ration- alism, irritating, of certain typically northern architects: there is a rational- ism that gives rise to houses and villas [built] for a life under the sun, amongst the trees and with flowers, overlooking the waters; and a rationalism that gives an inhuman vision of squalor and night- mares (italics mine)."12 This question of a distinction between the potentially disruptive rationalism of the Modern Movement and an easily recognized tradition was to surface from time to time in Terragni's work. In the project for the Palazzo Littorio in Rome, of 1934 Terragni and his collaborators recognized the problem and attempted to mediate between "building" and "culture" by placing a hyperbolically modern structure over an archeologi- cally derived groundplan. Likewise the problem surfaced periodically in the tombs and monuments. And in the Dan- teum project it is given perhaps its most sophisticated solution: a balanced com- position that adhered to neither side of the architectural/political debate, butwas able to rise above it.13 The revival of Lombard Gothic architec- ture in the late-nineteenth century, and the theoretical underpinning to support it, was largely the work of Camillo Boito. Boito's book of 1880, L'Architettura del Medioevo in Italia, strongly influenced Italian architectural theory for the last two decades of the century.14 Boito, like many architects in England and the USA, and Viollet-le-duc in France, was fasci- nated by the middle ages, but he cou- pled this interest with a heightened sense</page><page sequence="3">..... . .. .,.. .. ...; .. . , .. . . .... ..

In a typical nineteenth-century manner Boito made distinctions amongst the various types of architectural elements of medieval architecture. He argued for a division of the "organic" and the "symbolic" parts of buildings. The first element was the "logical structural skeleton, more rational than artistic," its complement resided in "allegorical abstract analogies."15 The architecture of the trecento was Boito's model, a time of varied needs and styles, but with a unity of purpose, like the unity of purpose of the Risorgimento itself. Boito was also a writer of fiction16 and his interest in natural language carried over into an interest in the language of architecture; this notion of linguaggio was to be carried forth into the twentieth century as one of the most consistently held paradigms for modern architecture in Italy. At the Milan Politecnico Terragni drew many buildings in various styles, from Medieval to the Classical modes17 (Figs. 3 &amp; 4), and in 1925 he made his first trip to Rome to see antiquity first hand. His sketches from this trip ai e revealing. One sheet of sketches of the Forum and Pal- atine shows an interest in detail, but more important, these sketches show Terrag- ni's sense of solid/void and the plasticity of Roman architecture. The Sketch labelled "Palatino" and dated 26 November (Fig. 5) abstracts the forms of the ancient palace into dark shadows and strong horizontal bands of Roman brickwork. And the drawing of the Tem- ple of Antoninus Pius displays Terragni's capacity for simplification and his ability to portray volume and plasticity with a 4 Terragni, University Project-interior of a both . : ;iiA simple line. The hexastyle portico looms above the viewer in extraordinary maj- esty, with the single "scale figure" acting like a Steinberg character, pulling the viewer back from the image into his own world, a world separate from the subject matter of the drawing. Thus, as early as 1925 we see the inklings of a sensibility that will create the enigmatic project for the Palazzo Littorio and the "metaphys- ical" project for the Danteum. The "worried" line of the Terragni sketch of an ancient ruin (Fig. 6), possibly part of the Basilica of Maxentius, possibly a detail from Hadrian's Villa, imparts the sensation that the massive walls support lightweight coverings: an accurate interpretation of the Roman way of building in masonry and concrete. Somewhat later, probably around 1928, Terragni made a sketch of the Torre di Porta Vittoria in Como (Fig. 7), one of the many gates in the city wall of the ancient castrum. His rendering of this gate is very accurate despite its lack of detail. The massive quality of the wall and the deep shadows of the tower are beautifully examined, even exagger- ated. But the "metaphysical" quality of the drawing is what is most interesting here. The sketch resembles a Sironi or a de Chirico, even though it depicts real place, real time and real building. In one of Terragni's first projects after graduation, the 1926 Monument to the War dead (his first collaboration with Pietro Lingeri) we see a direct adapta- tion of medieval style in response to the competition brief (Fig. 8). As Vitale has written, "Terragni, who was a local historian of his home town, always maintained a strong and unique relationship in his projects with these monuments which were patiently studied and scrutinized."'1 The architects' sensitivity to the urban context of the Piazza del Duomo is 6 Terragni, sketch of ancient ruins, Rome immediately apparent. Were their scheme executed, the Piazza would have been contained geometrically but not cordoned off (Fig. 9); the axes of the new project were allowed to influence the piazza, the axis of the small church of S. Giacomo was aligned through the axis of the scheme, and the entire project was carefully knitted into the context. The same sensitivity would be shown in one of Terragni's last projects, an urban design for the district just north of the Piazza del Duomo, the Cortesella proj- ect of 1940. Further historical sources for the Mon- umento ai Caduti are of interest here, beyond the adjacent S. Giacomo source noted by Vitale.19 One of the most important is the church of Sant'Abbondio. (Fig. 10) From this Church, one of Como's most beautiful and magnificent medi- eval monuments, Terragni and Lingeri adapted the nave columns. (Fig. 11) Argan has described the Monumento ai Caduti project as neither "... Neo- Romanesque nor Novecentesco... (but) ... between Metaphysical and Valori Plastici."20 The resemblance of this project to paintings of the Metaphysical school of de Chirico and other painters of the time-with their highly ambiguous historical/stylistic qualities-confirms that part of Argan's judgment. The power of de Chirico's and Sironi's paintings is that they portray a genius loci without having to choose between Graeco-Roman details on the one hand, and a vernac- ular Mediterraneanism on the other. Terragni and Lingeri's project does just that, too. Vitale also noted that their project was "... not neo-Romanesque as a straight imitation or as eclecticism; it is a refer- ence to an archaic, massive, primitive structure..."21 The project is, however, very much a neo-Romanesque work.

Recalling antiquity more than the throughout Europe and America in the Classical architecture of the period. Projects as wide-ranging in style and detail as Calderini's Palazzo di Giusti- zia in Rome, 1904, and Antonio Sant'Elia's facade project for the Cassa di Rispar- mio in Verona, 1913, have the same motif. (Figs. 12 &amp; 13) Sant'Elia's project was created in the florid Secessionist style related to Italian Neo-Baroque22 (Fig. 14) and is reminiscent of the work of Boito and d'Aronco. But for Terragni and Lingeri's stripped-down competition entry there existed another and more imme- diate inspiration. It was the twelfth-cen- tury Torre di Porta Vittoria mentioned above. While the specific parti of the Monumento ai Caduti differs markedly from that of the Torre, its character and concept are similar. Both Lingeri and Terragni were to return to such compo- sitions in later projects, and were influ- enced by similar sources for projects that bear little detail resemblance to the design his very last project, a Tomb in a small churchyard above Lake Como, in the same Romanesque-derived style. Terragni's sketches in his last year at the Milan Politecnico-Michelangelesque studies (Fig. 15)-also show a marked similarity to Sant'Elia's sketches of his pre-Futurist period, such as those for the Cassa di Risparmio in Verona in 1913- 14. (Figs. 13 &amp; 14) Sant'Elia and Terragni shared a common sensibility in this regard, and Michelangelo was a perfect model for both architects. Monumental scale irrespective of size, robust plastic- ity, and a sensitive play of rotund and flat, were hallmarks of the influence of Michelangelo on both Sant'Elia and Terragni. 10 Sant'Abbondio, Como, 1 lc, painting by Terragni 9 Terrogni and Lingeri, Monumento ai Caduti, plan ?* . ... .:: : .. ... .... . .?i~~i h . .....:. .... . 11 Terragni and Lingeri, Monumento ai Caduti, detail of column AL * xBx ,VbUI$~r t;r;#ow +w ?-??~,9........ ^ , w s y E i-~ ~ s;5s? l ZiR:bX *.Z.!~~~~~~~i . . /.,.... : , :: ..': ; : . .. . . . 13 Sant'Elia, Cassa di Risparmio di Verona, 19--, sketch ?

(Figs. 17 &amp; 18) There is a curious Michelan- gelesque quality to the 1913 Caprotti sketch. The block has been carved and the figure is "liberated" from the stone like a Michelangelo captive. "He [Terragni] studied Michelangelo," wrote Bottoni, "perhaps for a spatial and plastic affinity,"23 but he studied him closely, and well. (Fig. 19) As in many of Terragni's studies, he combined diverse elements of the models he was drawing from, combining the Julius II tomb with the Laurentian Library vestibule with the entry stair from the Pal. Senatore on the Campidoglio. (Fig. 20) Here the three- point perspective imparts an enormous grandeur, and recalls the worm's-eye drawings of Sant'Elia. These motifs would return in the Tomba Stecchini and Tomba Pirovano, and they "go underground" in Terragni's more modern-looking buildings, but they remain. In Terragni's very first professional com- mission, the Villa Saibene near Como of 1926 (Fig. 21), he displayed the hand of a well-schooled academic architect, as well as a budding talent. The building is 19 Terragni, figure studies a perfectly symmetrical cubic block in one direction, asymmetrical in the other, with a plinth cut by an elaborate stair crowned by bollards, leading to an oversized arcuated entry portal, itself crowned by a small balcony flanked by niches. Rusticated corners are added as if indeed they were made of paper-thin revetments, possibly an unconscious prelude to Terragni's later interest in the layering of thin planes. The entire com- position is crowned by an overhanging roof supported by oversized brackets. While sources for the composition may be found in many architectures, the motif of the side-facade windows comes directly from Vincenzo Scamozzi's house in Vicenza. There is an overblown qual- ity to this composition, a caricature that more than reflects its origins in the late ottocento architecture of Lombardy and in the Michelangelo studies, but also portends a future sensibility to materials and composition that Terragni was to retain throughout his career. Terragni's first professional commission to bear fruit was the renovation of the facade of the Hotel Metropole-Suisse in Como's Piazza Cavour. (Fig. 22) This piazza faces Lake Como, with the hotel 20 Terrogni, Michelangelesque sketch, with "Campidog- lio" Stair '_" ~ ,i '\: ....: ' '" in a decidedly Novecento style, using 21 Terragni, Villa Saibene, perspective occupying the most prominent position, facing both the piazza and the lake. Ter- ragni gave the lower two floors a facelift in a decidedly Novecento style, using green and white marbles. There are no extant drawings (or are there?) for this ground-floor renovation, but early pho- tographs, one of which was made before the canopy was installed, are available. (Fig. 23) The project appears at first glance to be a standard renovation in the Novecento style, but upon further inspection a num- ber of particularities appear. Perhaps the most subtle of these is the use of a triple torus moulding for the string course. (Fig. 24) Another torus is used for the bases of the pilasters (Fig. 25) and for the base of the building itself (this is par- tially obscured by a later raising of the piazza, and is now visible only on the lakefront facade), a condition described by Pedio as offending the sensibility of the local Fine Arts Commission (Com- missione d'Omato). Terragni immedi- ately defended himself in a letter to the local newspaper to the effect that the Commission needed only look to the Como Cathedral to find such a mould- ing.24 This sort of attack and defense Summer 1988 JAE 41/4</page><page sequence="6">24 Terragni, Metropole-Suisse, detail of string course 22 Terrogni, Hotel Metropole-Suisse, Como, 1927 :.~~ n : ,~ olt%.: ~,em~~ .~ ' :' $.?.; " ?cl':~ "s; "4 '~ i'. -"^l""^^^""!

The building is a pre-vision of what was to come, however, in terms other than Terragni's willingness to fight for his aesthetic rights. The project is a subtle exercise in surface, mass and detail, as shown in the design of the pilasters and the niches containing urns. The design may be described as truly eclectic, deriving much of its inspiration from Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Vignola, and Borromini. From Brunelleschi (and from the local traditions of Como) come the contrasting charcoal-gray and light- green marbles, detailed in a particularly Brunelleschian fashion. The continuities and discontinuities, the relationship of "known" elements to the context, and the reversals of architec- tonic "roles" are all interesting here. Terragni took what seems like a simple pair of telescoped pilasters and, in the manner of Michelangelo, imbedded them-conceptually and literally-in the wall. (Fig. 26) First, he carved out the wall to receive the telescoped pilasters. Then he crowned the entire ensemble, including the recess, with a capital, and Summer 1988 JAE 41/4 26 Terrogni, Metropole-Suisse, detail of pilaster capitals further reasserted the dominance of the front pilaster via another moulding which drops down to the rear pilaster to become a capital of almost the same dimension as the uppermost capital. The manipu- lation does not end here, however, because Terragni then projected the frontmost pilaster upward to engage the horizontal string course moulding that divides the ground floor from the piano nobile. Finally, the pilaster continues upward to support a "Greek" ante-fixe terminus. This sense of interweaving and overlap was to return in the idiom of the Modern Movement, but with a remem- brance of Mannerism always veiled and in the background. The flatness of the composition, however, recalls not Michelangelo, but Vignola, an architect that Terragni was to emulate in other contexts. Borromini, also a Lombard architect (and one who surely must qualify as a Mae- stro Comacino), provided the inspiration for the niches and urns, flattened into purely decorative motifs, and with no small measure of irony.

The Casa del Fascio in Como, 1932-36, is the most celebrated of Terragni's buildings, and one that derives from a variety of sources. Franco Purini has explained the origins of the Casa del Fascio, as "... metaphor of the Roman compound, metaphor of its own isola- tion, metaphor of the Como courtyard house."26 The Como courtyard house paradigm is a particularly acute obser- vation, in my opinion, since so many of the courtyard houses in Como, unlike the palazzi of Rome, display an entrance along the edge of the court and there- fore present a "C"-shaped block against a bar, like the Casa del Fascio. (Fig. 29) The Casa was first recognized (in print) as a Renaissance Palace by Rocchi.27 Cesare de Seta also saw the plan this way.28 But the building is more than a simple Florentine-Roman palace. The Casa displays characteristics of both the Florentine-Roman and the Venetian pal- ace types. On the ground floor, we enter into a highly stratified set of spaces where a cross-axis uniting the Sacrario and the major stair recalls the loggias of Renais- sance Palaces, as Eisenman's delicate diagrams have shown.29 The piano nobile and second floor show the typical Flor- entine palace format, with the stair dis- 29.32 Terragni, Casa del Fascio, Como, Front Facade (Wm. Hendrix) Th il li ? i .- - 30 Sansovino, Palazzo Corner a San Maurizio, 1553 posed on the cross-axis of the loggia, and the grand room placed in direct relationship to the stair. The "square- doughnut" parti is evident on these two floors and indeed pervades the entire scheme, but on the ground and top floors another reading appears, as Vitale's elegant diagrams portray.30 The central space occupies a zone similar to the portego of the typical Venetian palace, complete with the stair that gives off immediately onto the portego with no transition. The similarity of Terragni's Casa to the Venetian palace type may be more than coincidental. The similarities come to light if we compare the Casa del Fascio to a typical Venetian Baroque palace, like the Ca' Corner a San Maurizio, by San- sovino. (Fig. 30) While the proportions of the groundplans vary considerably between the two buildings, the similarity in the location of certain elements is uncanny. The central portego space of the Vene- tian prototype has been adapted, with its opening front and back, "shotgun" style, allowing light and air to move through the plan. In the Venetian palace, as in the Casa del Fascio, the portego was a reception hall. In both cases a few steps lead to a shal- low portico which allows for the transi- tion into the building and permits entry into a small room facing the street. Immediately upon entry we are shown the important stair that rises from the portego, or we may also move through the space to use the quotidian stair at the rear. In the side zones, rooms run back in a row in both buildings (but not enfilade in Terragni's building). .:.v_r- vZre-. r. ~ ; ., , - r .rv,:-*_ : ~ r m. . . ._ _ . . ._.. = = requiring a detailed explanation.

The Venetian palace type itself is often cited by conmporary architects to be an architecture as one of the best examples expreof the close relationshipre of inside and outside. The porter bay. is typically pro- evidjected onto indithe facae as a screen wallrchi- while the side bays are considerably less porous, a conditin ofthe Ren assumed by contemporary architects to be an expression of the serial nature of the rooms in the outer bay. But there is no evidence to indicate that Venetian archi- tects, particularly in the Renaissance and Baroque periods, ever saw the portego this way. Rather, they tried to make their facades resemble the multi-tiered log- gias of antiquity, as if the Palace were a public building in private hands. The Casa del Fascio also displays this trait, here in the asymmetrical manner typical of many late-medieval Venetian palaces (and like many of Terragni's composi- tions). (Fig. 32) The gridded screen of the facade has been stretched across all five of the left-hand bays like an ancient loggia. Indeed, the lack of hierarchy in this front facade is fully explicable, in my view, only when interpreted as such an "ancient" gesture, as is the Vene- tian palace facade of the seventeenth century. The projection of the innards onto the external wall is, however, a valid inter- pretation for the other three facades of the Casa del Fascio. Each of the different four facades is telling a different "story" about the inside of the building.31 The south facade on Via Bianchi is the most solid and the most continuous in its plan- arity, yet it is subdivided into groupings of windows that express the spaces directly behind. (Fig. 33) On this facade Summer 1988 JAE 41/4 .... . . . ^ M- mp--. r r-l p w i</page><page sequence="8">the existence of toilets is announced by high panels of glass block. This panel was used on all four floors. On the top- most floor the toilet is replaced by an office, yet the glass block is retained for continuity, rather than changed for func- tional expression.32 The rear facade tells another story about the building. Its tale is of the tri-partite Venetian palace plan and of the division of the building into two zones vertically: the lower two storeys below the glass- brick roof of the courtyard, and an upper zone. The vertical distinction is made rather subtly via the coplanar frame ele- ments that divide the facade in half. (Fig. 34) The north facade (Via Pessina) is the most interesting. (Fig. 35) It contains the most varied divisions yet it is highly unified; it expresses the most number of different readings about the interior, yet even here Terragni made choices that favored the continuity of the surface over the sim- plistic "exploded cube" reading of internal expression. Figure 36, an inter- vention onto Terragni's facade, shows how the rooms directly behind the facade would be best expressed. This interven- tion destroys the simplicity and direct- ness of the structural idea, to say nothing of the most important reading of the inside in relation to the outside: the courtyard. Here Terragni was the most Vignol- esque, with the layers stripped away like pieces of Strathmore board, and with the horizontal continuities brought off in the receding planes. These traditional qualities of this build- ing are partially masked by a compo- sition of complex and intricate facades perhaps unparalleled in the Modern Movement, where a variety of fenestra- tion is integrated within a frame system in the image of modern construction. The scheme of stripping away at the surface of the facade recalls the Mannerist architecture of the second half of the sixteenth century: the architecture of Vignola, Palladio, Giulio Romano, Sam- micheli, and of course, Michelangelo.

Proportion, figure, stereo- metry, massing, and the careful distri- bution of the elements of the facade are among these ideas. The Erba Monument and the Sarfatti Tomb represent the extremes of the idea of the Classical in Terragni's oeuvre. (Fig. 38) The Erba monument is in a straightforward Nove- cento Neo-Classical style, while the Sar- fatti Tomb is stripped of all elements, and, like some of Palladio's villas, remains true to the Albertian principles of classic art, while eschewing the detail of the Graeco-Roman system of ornament. Terragni's buildings in literal Classical style each represent a variation on the work of a different major architect of the Italian Classical tradition. The Stecchini tomb is Michelangelesque, the Hotel Metropole-Suisse is Borrominian. The Sarfatti Monument is Palladian (it is not by chance that this work is in Palladio's own back yard), while the Monument at Erba combines Palladian planning, with Bramantesque passages in the exedra, and Michelangelo's imbedded columns from the Ricetto Laurenziana and the Campidoglio.

They are, of course, the Casa del Fascio in Como, the Danteum project and the Pal. Littorio Competition, solution 'A'. In these build- ings the underlying substratum of Clas- sicism that was Le Corbusier's, Mies's and Wright's shows Terragni to be yet another crypto-Classicist in Modern- Movement dress.

Classical has become, since the advent of Modernism, a term too often misused. But, like all lin- guistic misuse, it becomes (and rightfully so) correct usage through sheer inertia. I therefore succumb to use Classical for both meanings: kits-of-parts and abstract formal con- figurations. 4 See Summerson, John The Classical Language of Archi- tecture MIT Press (Cambridge, MA) 1963 for an explana- tion of Corbusier's Classicism. Le Corbusier also said, "I do not have to use the Modules of Vignola to be a Clas- sicist" (see Arch. Forum, Oct. 1965).
