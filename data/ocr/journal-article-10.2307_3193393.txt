<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arts and Cultural Context A Curriculum Integrating Discipline-Based Art Education with Other Humanities Subjects at the Secondary Level David Amdur "... to promote an analysis of artworks which considers them as a complete expression of the religious, metaphysical, political and economic tendencies of an epoch and which, as such, cannot be limited to a particular discipline." - Walter Benjamin (quoted in Levin, 1988) An integrated curriculum is based on the idea that knowledge and skills are syner- gistic; more is gained when interrelation- ships are promoted than when lessons are kept isolated. This idea is supported by the theories of cognitive psychologists (e.g., Bruner, Goodnow &amp; Austin, 1956) who conceive of knowledge and skills as being knit together by complex webs of intercon- nections. When interconnections are increased, learning is made easier and lessons have wider application. Student motivation is also increased when lessons in different areas of study are made relevant to each other (Jacobs, 1989). Unfortunately, the usual departmentaliza- tion of subject areas in secondary schools does not promote such interconnections. High schools often operate like an assem- bly line where each new piece of knowl- edge is "put on" the students at separate learning stations. Until recently, this general tendency toward isolation of subject areas has been particularly intensified with respect to art programs by an overemphasis on factors that set our field apart from all others. Over the past several years, the almost singular dominance of studio practice in public school art education has been a significant object of reform (e.g., Getty, 1985). An- other important but waning factor has been the profound influence of the aesthetic doctrine called "formalism" on art curricula (Feldman, 1992). In its extreme position, formalism holds that the sole focus of aesthetic attention, critical meaning, and evaluative criteria in art should be the organization of visual elements; the value of non-visual meanings and contextual information is discounted. Formalism, then, tends to effectively isolate art from the rest of culture.2 To the extent that an art teacher still subscribes to this doctrine, the art room remains isolated from the rest of the school. This may cause some students, administrators, and others to regard the visual arts as a technical specialty unes- sential to general education. During the last decade, the approach known as Discipline-Based Art Education (DBAE) has broadened the purview of art education by promoting recognition that comprehensive study of art requires consideration from several interconnected perspectives (Getty, 1985; Dobbs, 1992). DBAE curriculum enhances students' expressive creativity and appreciation of art through instruction in the related disciplines of critical analysis, art history, and aesthetics and establishes these disciplines as valuable in themselves. Fitzpatrick (1992) and Erickson, Katter, and Stewart (1988), have further expanded DBAE by developing Contextual Inquiry approaches for teaching art disciplines. I have independently piloted a similar approach in high school art classes I have taught. Contextual Inquiry approaches encourage students to question why a given image was produced in a particular context. While a formalist would argue that interest in an image's original context takes away from interest in its formal qualities, I 12 Art EducationlMay 1993</page><page sequence="2">have found that formal qualities are given closer inspection by students when they are seen as clues to the lived experience of the people who made and used art objects. Students will often prejudge a strange art work as "ugly;" however, when they are encouraged to "read" the work's stylistic characteristic to discover the human value and ideas that informed its making, they become closely involved. Better understanding of formal qualities and greater aesthetic appreciation follow. When art is considered comprehen- sively, including not only its formal quali- ties, but also its "literary" content and its role as a social document, opportunities for learning art are enhanced. Therefore, a complete study of art demands knowledge and methods that have traditionally been defined as belonging to the provinces of other subject areas. Contextual Inquiry enlivens the study of art by reaching out to history, literature, and other arts and sciences for background and comparative material to find thematic connections in values and concepts. These comparisons lead to a more compelling picture of the lived experience expressed in artworks. It can be difficult, however, for a solitary art teacher to provide the desired scope of comparative material in the context of a single course. I and other teachers who have implemented contextual inquiry courses have found it necessary to devote significant time to instruction of basic historical background and fundamental writing skills.3 Time limitations have often prevented me from presenting stimulating illustrative texts. Clearly, this rewarding approach to the study of art would benefit from a program of thematic integration with other humanities courses which would provide much wider resources of relevant contents and instruction. The other courses in such a program would, in return, find invaluable resources in the visual arts. Visual imagery has unique powers to motivate, inform, and facilitate long term memorization (Broudy, 1987). Because artworks are vividly expressive products of their original social contexts, they can be used to bring stu- dents to empathic connection with a foreign or historical culture considered in a social studies class. Further, more explicit connections can be drawn between an artwork's stylistic characteristics and the defining characteristics of its original culture. By the end of their first term, my ninth grade art students were able to recognize in the spatial and dynamic qualities of the Sistine Ceiling signs of the new respect for individual autonomy that characterized the Renaissance. Other examples of these sorts of connections will be considered below. Such heuristics can provide powerful advance organizers and memory aids for students of social studies. Language arts share much common ground with the visual arts because both subjects concentrate on means of expres- sion. Both employ similar methods of critical analysis and interpretation; the teaching of these skills could be coordi- nated. Both subjects examine similar uses of symbolism; these could be explicitly e A4 s Interdisciplinary Artsa. -I s Organizing Theme: Historical Developments e of Culture Infused throughout: 01 * Expository Writing * Thinking and Learning Skills * Philosophical Issues Fig. 1 Art EducationlMay 1993 13</page><page sequence="3">compared. Good writing can be stimulated by the richly evocative images that visual art can provide. Additionally, profitable comparisons can be made between creative processes in each area. The sketchbook compares to the written joumal, "rush writing" compares to auto- matic or spontaneously responsive draw- ing, and the processes of revision and editing to create a composition are general analogous (Marzano et al., 1988) Other subject areas may be integrated into such a curriculum. All subjects would become more compelling when linked by common narratives that recover a sense of lived experience. Such an integrated curriculum would make learning more accessible to a variety of students' learning styles (Dunn &amp; Griggs, 1988) by presenting related contents in courses using different instructions meth- ods and media. Emphasis on inquiry and the abundance of comparative material provided would exercise a large number of thinking skills such as observing, compar- ing, classifying, analyzing, synthesizing, and inferring. This would create a favorable environment for explicitly teaching such skills in a coordinated fashion. (See Marzano et al., 1988, for a useful guide in this area). Philosophical concepts and methods, which have been introduced into DBAE curricula in the aesthetics compo- nent, can be developed in tandem with related contents in other courses. "Writing across the curriculum" strategies, devel- oped to help students use writing as a thinking and learning tool in all subjects (Maimon, 1983), would benefit in the setting created by thematic integration. "Whole language," an approach to integrated curriculum that has recently been gaining acceptance particularly in the elementary grades, resembles the model presented here in featuring thematic interconnections between subjects, a focus on inquiry and encouragement of a variety of impressive and expressive learning modes. These approaches differ in that whole language places more stress on student autonomy and is less systematic. The free-ranging '1ollow your bliss" orienta- tion of whole language is well suited for developed appetites for intellectual inquiry. However, once students are receptive to leaming, they are able to reach beyond idiosyncratic interests and vernacular vocabulary to master the concepts, vo- cabulary, and skills fundamental to a comprehensive education. This is best accomplished working with expert teachers using a carefully planned curriculum. Arts in Context: The Curriculum Model In Interdisciplinary Curriculum: Design and Implementation Jacobs (1989) gives a graphic model of an integrated curriculum as a wheel in which the spokes represent the separate subject areas. At the center "hub" is the Organizing Theme that unites the subject areas (see Fig. 1). The Organizing Theme suggested here is Historical Developments of Culture. Through this progressive theme, humani- ties subjects find common ground by simultaneously considering objects of study from related periods or cultures. Each subject teacher is able to illustrate concepts with comparative material drawn from other subjects. Taken together, art, literature, social conditions, and events paint a full and vivid picture of peoples' lives during each culture period. Students' curiosity can be stimulated by comparing different ways of life, and these sorts of comparisons elicit use of higher order thinking skills. Organizing principles for the Arts In Cultural Context Curriculum are listed below: 1) Formulate an Organizing Theme for each cultural period that concisely ex- presses its major characteristics. (In later units, challenge students to participate in the process of formulation. This process encourages skills of synthesis [Bloom, et al., 1956] and examination of the connota- tive power of words.) 2) Choose paradigm "texts" (historical, visual, literary) that are typical of each period, clearly express its theme, and contrast clearly with texts chosen to represent proximate periods. 3) For social studies, establish funda- mental political/economic concepts (such as "class," conservative," etc.) and philo- sophical concepts (such as "materialism" vs. "idealism") which will be revealed by examining and comparing cultural periods. 4) For language and visual arts, clearly formulate stylistic characteristics of art- works and texts to be considered and relate those to the theme formulated for their cultural period.

Encourage recognition of the tentative nature of knowledge. Students should be rewarded for challenging and revising themes, definitions, descriptions, analysis, interpretations, and so on. 6) Although primary focus is on general historic trends, students occasionally consider counter-examples. (e.g., as a counter example of the rigid conventions of Egyptian sculpture, the "unfrozen" style of Akhenaton; see Hauser pp. 43-49) 7) Asynchronic comparisons can reveal contrasts or similarities in different histori- cal circumstances, clarify concepts, and/or make aspects of past cultures relevant to students' own experience. 8) Balance impressive and expressive modes of learning. Both should be sub- stantively related to the Organizing Theme. 9) Coordinate the teaching of thinking and learning skills, philisophical concepts, and expository writing, in all subjects. A Sample Unit To illustrate how this curriculum could work, I have outlined a sample Unit on Prehistoric Cultures (see Fig. 2). The Organizing Theme for Paleolithic cultures is Bands Searching the Natural World. This theme gives key words that relate aspects of these cultures. The Social Students teacher introduces the unit with clips from a documentary film, such as one about the Waldanni tribe in the Amazon jungle which appeared on PBS's Nova series. This is an example of an "asynchronic comparison." Its origins were not from the Paleolithic period, but rather, from a living hunter/ gatherer group that is culturally similar. The film portrays a small, egalitarian hunting band. The strength, skill, and ingenuity of these people would elicit respect and interest from most students, as they see the nomadic hunters' intimate connection to, and respect for, the natural world. These values are also vividly expressed in the literature example, Chief Seattle's Letter, excerpted below.4 "The President in Washington sends word that he wishes to buy our land. But how can you buy or sell the sky? The land? The idea is strange to us. If we do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them? "Every part of this earth is sacred to my people. Every shining pine needle, every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every meadow, every humming insect. All are holy in the memory and experience of my people. "We know the sap which courses through the trees as we know the blood that courses through our veins. We are part of the earth and it is part of us. The perfumed flowers are our sisters. The bear, the deer, the great eagle, these are our brothers. The rocky crests, the juices in the meadow, the body heat of the pony, and man, all belong to the same family ... "This we know: the earth does not below to man, man belongs to the earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself ... "Your destiny is a mystery to use. What will happen when the buffalo are all slaughtered? The wild horses tamed? What will happen when the secret corners of the forest are heavy with the scent of many men and the view of the ripe hills is blotted by talking wires? Where will the thicket be? Gone! Where will the eagle be? Gone! And what is to say goodbye to the swift pony and the hunt? The end of living and the beginning of survival ... "We love this earth as a newborn loves its mother's heartbeat. So, if we sell you our land, love it as we have loved it. Care for it as we have cared for it. Hold in your mind the memory of the land as it is when you receive it. Preserve the land for all children and love it, as God loves us all..." The language arts class discusses the relation between this text's values and its expressive references to images of natural forms. This serves as a point of departure for a writing exercise devoted to evocative use of concrete imagery. After the lan- guage arts class has become familiar with this text, the social studies teacher uses it as a point of departure to introduce the related spiritual beliefs of animism and, shamanism and, perhaps also, touch on modern ecological concerns. 16 Art EducationlMay 1993</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 3: Student painting, exercise 1 The visual arts class examines repro- ductions of Paleolithic cave painting from Lascaux, France,. These paintings are thought to have been products of shaman- istic initiation rituals (Campbell and Moyers, 1988 pp. 81). The example reproduced in Fig. 2a is representative in its remarkable "naturalism"; that is, it skillfully recovers careful observations. Students can readily understand that careful observation would be a skill developed by hunters. It can also be said that the process through which these images were achieved involved a sort of search. There is evidence that Paleolithic artists searched for the sugges- tions of these images in the naturally occurring relief patterns of the cave walls - much as one might find "bunny" in the random form of a cloud (Janson, 1986, pp. 28). The Paleolithic hunter then used earth- colored paints to "capture" the image. In a related studio exercise (Fig. 3), students create random patterns by spilling ink on several sheets of paper. Next, they "search" these patterns until each student finds a suggestion of a latent image. These images are then slowly enhanced and clarified by students through the application of translucent layers of earth-colored acrylic paint. During the exercise students are read the quotation from Leonardo Da Vinci (cited in McKim, 1972, pp. 57) excerpted here: "... when you look at a wall spotted with stains ... you may discover a resemblance to ... figures in action or strange faces and costumes, and an endless variety of objects which you could reduce to com- plete and well-drawn forms." They are also shown examples of Verist Surrealist paintings, such as those by Max Ernst, that had their origin in accidental techniques. These asynchronic compari- sons establish a sense of the universality of this sort of projection of imagination. After the exercise, students exchange paintings and write brief descriptions of what they see in each others' work. They are then asked to discuss these questions: "Where did your image come from? Was it an accident or did you create the image when you found it? Did your partner see something different in your work than you did?" and "Was your partner's interpreta- tion, in itself, an act of imagination?" Discussion leads students to consider that images are always a meeting of form and imagination, that the construal of an Art Education/May 1993 17</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 4: Student painting, exercise 2 image's meaning is always an imaginative act. A Contrasting Culture In the foregoing lessons, similarities were used to clarify and reinforce concepts. Another important principle in this curricu- lum is comparison of contrasts. Neolithic cultures contrast strongly with Paleolithic cultures. The social studies class begins to explore the differences. The Organizing Theme for Neolithic cultures is Control and Collectivity. The Neolithic revolution began when people learned to control parts of nature, i.e. plants and animals, through domestication. Those aspects of nature that are beyond human control were enculturated and supplicated as "Big Brother" cult deities. The pattern of control, animal - human being - deity, is repeated in the hierarchical political structure that began in village society. Village life subor- dinated the individual to collective society. Campbell (pp. 99) explains how this manifest in the sphere of religion: We find a shamanic aspect in practically all hunting cultures ... There's a major differ- ence ... between a shaman and a priest. A priest is a functionary of a social sort ... The deity to whom he is devoted ... was there before he came along. But the shaman's powers are symbolized in his own familiars, deities of his own personal experience. His authority comes out of a psychological experience, not a social ordination ... When this big emphasis came on the settled village life, the shaman lost power. Campbell describes Navaho and Apache myths recounting the usurpation of sha- mans' status by priests. Recorded versions of traditional oral myths of village farming cultures exhibit abstract imagery and formalized structure. At the Neolithic stage of culture, relations between people and their world are less intimate, more concep- tual. The language arts class could exam- ine these myths and find others for com- parison, such as the story of Cain and Abel from Genesis. Students may then compose their own "mythic histories." The Neolithic artist asserted control over his subjects through the formal play of geometric abstraction. It will be seen that the animals pictured in the Neolithic painting (Fig. 2b) are less naturalistic and less organic in shape than the Paleolithic example. The tendency toward geometric abstraction is also noted in other examples from Neolithic and comparable modern tribal cultures. In the visual arts class, the progressive transformation from naturalistic to abstract imagery that occurred over millennia, may, to some extent, be repli- cated by students in a studio exercise. First, students are shown examples of abstracted heads from Neolithic and Tribal cultures. Series works by modern artists, such as Picasso's Bull lithographs of 1945- 46 (Rubin, ed., 1980, pp. 390-1), are used as asynchronic comparative examples to demonstrate the process of transformation to progressively more abstract forms. In the exercise, students begin by drawing as naturalistic a portrait as they can accom- plish in twenty minutes. They then use this portrait as the starting point for a series of progressively more abstract images (Fig. 4). Class discussion considers the ideas and feelings that students find expressed by stylizations and how abstraction can clarify formal relationships. This is followed by discussion of the possibilities of natural- 18 Art EducationlMay 1993</page><page sequence="8">ism and stylization to convey different sorts of knowledge. An alternative studio assignment is more oriented to iconography. Students are shown examples of Hopi Kachina dolls and are asked to compare these to comic book "superheroes". They are guided to recognize both as anthropomorphic mythic forms that supplant individual identity in favor of symbols for elemental or animal powers. These artforms connect human- kind to nature (or in the case of the modern "cyborg", to machines). Students then create their own pictures of humanoid embodiments of awe inspiring forces. This unit on Prehistoric Cultures, through the study of art, literature, and social conditions, along with studio exer- cises and written assignments, enables students to reach vivid, complex, and memorable understandings of two funda- mentally different cultures. Moreover, these global understandings make discipline- specific concepts, such as "naturalism" or hierarchy" etc., more comprehensible and more memorable. I have demonstrated how separate humanities courses can be made relevant to each other in a curriculum that is en- riched by drawing upon DBAE in a funda- mental role. Art study is enriched by the wealth of comparative material other subject areas provide. This approach to integration relates material in ways that are accessible to different learning styles. It elicits use of higher order thinking skills, and encourages cross-cultural and multi- cultural perspectives. For these reasons, it would clearly enhance educational oppor- tunities for secondary students. It may be implemented without abandoning the structure of the separate subject areas or the wealth of expertise which specialized teachers bring to them. Rather, integration may be accomplished, without radically altering the departmental and course structures in place in most secondary schools, by coordinating separate courses to parallel and mutually reinforce one another.
