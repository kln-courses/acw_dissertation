The length of the nestling period seems to be shorter at higher latitudes for some passerines. The adaptive value of coloration of some birds is related to the degree of their activity in dim light.

Body temperature and water requirements in the Mourning Dove, Zenaidura macroura marginella. Ecol. Monogr., 35: 181-187.-Nighttime temperature averaged 20 C. lower than daytime temperature of 41.50 C. When kept at 390 C. air temperature, body temperature rose, more markedly when the birds were deprived of water. Birds drank four times as much water at 390 C. than at 230 C. air temperatures. Twenty- four hours at 390 C. without water resulted in a loss of 15 per cent of body weight, but normal weight was recovered within a few minutes when the bird was again given water. The species is well adapted to desert conditions. BvBg,t W. 1954. Discovered-the nest and egg of the Black-winged Bellbird. Animal Kingdom, 57: 115-119.-Procnias averano carnobarba in Trinidad.

Seasonal changes in bill length of certain passerine birds. Condor, 56: 142-149.-This important study demonstrates an increase in bill length of certain passerine species during the summer months at which time there is less wear on the bill. In the winter when these species are largely vegetarian there is more wear on the bill tips so that the length of the bill is significantly shorter than for the same species during the summer. These findings should caution the taxonomist when analysing the bill lengths of species in which the diet varies seasonally. D. W. Johnston. DAVIS, T. A. W. 1953.

The two species differ not only in foraging habits but also in size of food items, thus strengthening Lack's contention concerning food habits of sympatric closely-related species. Even though the preferred habitats are not always entirely different, rufescens and inornatus have mutually exclusive breeding territories. The "invading" rufescens has had to adjust to co6ccupancy with inornatus by using vacated or suboptimal nesting territories.-D. W. Johnston. DUGAN, W. D. 1953.

MOREAU, R. E. 1953. Migration in the Mediterranean area. Ibis, 95: 329- 364.-There is concentrated use by a few species of the shortest routes across the Mediterranean Sea, but mainly broad-front movement seems to be the rule. Thus, there is movement also across the widest part of the sea, which may be from 430 to 800 miles in distance. Included is an annotated list of the major publications pertaining to migration in countries of the Mediterranean area. MOREAU, R. E. 1954.

Ibis, 96: 207-224.-Hatching success in Megadyptes antipodes with relation to age of birds was known for 733 nests in 17 seasons on the Otago Peninsula, New Zealand. These birds acquire adult plumage during the age 14 to 18 months, but are not then sexually mature. 48 per cent of two-year-old females breed, and most of the remainder the following year. Fertility in two-year-old females was 18 per cent; in three-year-olds, 82 per cent; in four-year-olds, 95 per cent; in birds 5 to 15 years, 93.7 per cent; in older birds, 91.7 per cent. Survival of chicks is apparently unrelated to the age of the parents. Two-year-old males almost never breed; in those that do fertility is markedly low. Three-year-old males are probably not as fertile as three-year-old females. Thus, there is apparent in these penguins a tendency toward adolescent sterility. This phenomenon strongly resembles that described for certain mammals. ROBINSON, T. S. 1954. Cannibalism by a Burrowing Owl [Speotyto cunicularia]. Wilson Bull., 66: 72. ROSCHZ, R. C. 1954.

Evolution, 8: 19-28, 5 figs., 2 tables.-In Parus geographical variation is closely related to climate. Size increased as the mean winter tempera- ture decreased. The wing length was found to be a satisfactory indication of general size. Mean size is greater (in populations inhabiting areas with similar mean winter temperatures) at low latitudes than at high. The relative lengths of beak and tarsus were found to decrease in the colder parts of the range of a species up to a certain point, beyond that colder temperatures did not result in further shortness. It is shown that similarity of color may exist in widely separated parts of the range of a species as the result of selection due to similar climates rather than close phologenetic relationship.

Small rodents predominate in the diets in winter and spring and larger mammals in the summer and autumn; birds and shrews are taken at a constant rate throughout the year. The owls take only prey species found closely around them. The author suggests that these owls can survive only if they hold a territory and are intimately familiar with it. STAZBLIR, A. E. 1954.

From a study of hand-reared birds it is concluded that the normal</page><page sequence="12">492 Recent Literature [vol. 71 3-phased song of the chaffinch has an inborn basis amounting to little more than the ability to produce a song of normal length and a crescendo series concluded by a single note of high pitch. All further refinements have to be learned although the innate basis is sufficiently selective to ensure that notes or songs of other species are not acquired. Some learning takes place during the first weeks of life, especially the first part, but details of phase three are not acquired. The latter is learned later when singing in competition with other chaffinchs. This results in formation of a community "pattern" and explains local variations of the song in the wild.
