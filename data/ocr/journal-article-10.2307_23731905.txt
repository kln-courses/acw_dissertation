<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EVOLUTION AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE \ MAKARA TORANA by LAKSHMAN RANAS1NGHE "Man has come to the point where truth defies his understand ing more than the lies ever born in his brain. The truth is here for all to see, yet man thinks it a fantasy, an Utopia—and scorns it to chase after chimeras". Dostoyevsky".1 In the context of credibility, what the human ear hears falls into three general categories, namely, fact, fiction and opinion. It is not possible to hazard dogmatic opinion on the origin of the makara (composite animal) symbol, since this involves inaccessible information steeped in pre-history and mystery. However, re corded data makes it possible at least to trace the evolution of the makara symbolism over more than 2000 years. The multi-faceted significance of art and architecture relating to the makara symbol is astrological, astronomical, mythical, philosophical, medical biological, technological, ethereal, religious, idealistic, and, re markably futurological. This varied significance also hinges heavily on opinion and interpretation. The late Ananda Coomaraswamy, pioneering researcher of mediaeval Sri Lankan art and craft, kindled vibrations of interest in both the East and West, which stimulated the study of the phi losophies, cultures, traditions, religions and life styles of our ances tors, With unrelenting dedication he studied the status and history of architecture, painting, pottery, sculpture and carving, embroi dery, weaving and metal casting. In this respect his monumental work Mediaeval Sinhalese Art has inculcated the modern occi dental investigative spirit into the mysticism oriented East. During the present century, regretably, commercialism has resulted in the degenerate use of the makara torana motif in orna ments and architecture. Coomaraswamy illustrates this view with a The «ex» of a lecture delivered on 30th April, 1990</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL R.A.S. (SRI LANKA) Vol. XXXVI, (N.S.) 1991/92 133 modern ivory casket (with four deviyo or gods),2 and stresses that the use of the makara torana, thus, is degrading.3 Many are the objects, now on display in curio, jewellery and "art" boutiques which, misrepresent or debase the ingenious makara symbol of spiritual endeavour, destiny and power (Plate la). But some usage of the makara motif cannot be considered bad or wrong; for example, twin makaru (plural) in an ivory necklace.4 The bronze ât-pahan (elephant lamp) from the upper relic chamber of the Kotavehera (Suthighara dagoba) in Dedigama demonstrates the use of 2 makaru supporting an arch with a gini-silu (flame) design above the su perior edge.5 The Gana Devi Hàlla has a description of the con struction of Ganëàa's palace where pictures of animals and makaru were painted on the walls.6 Hindu deity and Boddhisatva images are often shown wearing makara ear ornaments (makara kundala) (Plate lb). Commenting on the primordial significance of the makara torana, Ranjith Fernando (personal communication, 1990) opines: "The makara torana represents the janua coeli or Gate of Heaven in sacred art; it marks the entrance to the niche, or cave of the world* which is the dwelling place of Divinity. "In Sinhalese Buddhist art it frames the entrance to the inner sanctum wherein is found the image of Divinity (the Buddha or Bôdhisattva) and even in relatively modern temples the darkness of this inner sanctum conveys the idea of the 'cave of the world "In Hindu art, the Natarâja, which is set in a niche, is surrounded by a flaming circle which proceeds out of the mouths of twin makaru, the very same concept. "In Christian art, in the doorways of Gothic cathedrals, for example in the Royal Portal at Chartres, the triple doorway repre sents, on the one side, the Gate of Heaven and on the other, janua inferni, the Gate of Hell, while above the central doorway, in the niche, sits Christ in Majesty. Again, the same idea. "It is through the Gate of Heaven that the Divine Sun des cends into the 'cave of the world', a cosmic event dramatically illustrated by the story of Christmas which is celebrated, for this reason, around the time of the winter solstice when the sun enters Capricorn."</page><page sequence="3">134 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MAKARA TORANA Makara is, in Indian astrology, the sign of Capricorn, the tenth house of the Zodiac, and the Makara Torana is comparable to the Gate of Heaven. Incidentally, the entrance of reverential rock caves in India and makara toran (plural) of the older Sri Lanka shrines, eg. Lankatilaka Vihara near Kandy and the Kela niya Raja Maha Vihara, face the rising sun (the East), Symbolism is both human frailty and strength which express and convey mystical, idealistic, celestial and abstract thoughts, and beliefs. "According to Vedic thought, the human mind, Kalpa, is the source from which all thoughts, either disciplined or uncon trolled (Sam-kalpa, Vikalpa), emanate. Mind is the virtual Thought Tree,—the Kalpa Vrksha."1 Since time immemorial the human intellect has indulged in symbolisation and imagery. In Greek mythology the halcyon was a fabulous bird associated with the winter solstice.8 The gargoyle, a grotesque face or creature, was carved on waterspouts projecting from roof gutters (Old French: gargouille=Throat)9. The dragon,10 a fabulous winged reptile, the phoenix,11 the sphinx,12 and the Dragonne,13—dragon in the hinder part and a lion in the fore, all represent the growth of sym bolism. Babylonian (Rahab the Dragon), Sumerian (Goat— Fish), Egyptian crocodile monsters (Ammit and Seth), and Greek (Puthion) composite—animal (water-based) symbolism evoked fear and respect.14 Greek mythologists invented a fire-breathing monster with the head of a lion, body of a goat, the tail of a serpent (Greek: khimaira=she-goat), which today we call a chimera. In modern biology and biotechnology chimera is defined as an or ganism consisting of at least two genetically different kinds of tissue as a result of mutation, grafting15 or genetic engineering. In 1516 Sir Thomas More coined the word Utopia (Greek: ou=not,+topos=a place; literally: "no place") as the title of his book that described an imaginary society blessed with perfect or ideal existence.16 The makara symbol may represent an Utopian chimera of supreme power and perfection. Although it originated as a figment of lofty artistic idealism, it may be considered the conceptual and semantic harbinger of modern biotechnology, which has recently spliced superior genes into the genetic code of life, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), producing startlingly improved species and products.</page><page sequence="4">PLATE 1 (a) Makara Mirrors, on hinges (b) Makara Kundala on Maitri Bodhisatva (Angurukaramulla )</page><page sequence="5">PLATE 2 (a) Wooden Makara Torana (Degaldoruwa) jfc«. - nm 'ii, ?• '%!: ■ J Cr'H g\rf ■ is v fe s ® 1 (b) Stone Thoroughfare Complex (National Museum)</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL R.A.S. (SRI LANKA) Vol. XXXVI, (N-S.) 1991/92 135 By the 18th century the elements that evolved in Sinhala decorative art featured predominantly in Kandyan motifs and designs17, and fitted into the following categories : Divine; Geometrical and Abstract; Vegetable: (a) mythical (b) conventional: lotus, petals Animal: (a) mythical animals: Kindura, Serapendiya, Àt-kanda Lihiniya, Makara, Bherunda Paksiya, Nara-simha, Gaja-simha (b) partly mythical: Kibihi (qmsi-Simha) face (c) natural (real) animals. The lotus symbol represents water and the Earth. The makara is a chimeric animal, and was initially associated with water and thus had a fish tail (Besnagar, around 3rd century, b.c.)18 or the features of a crocodile (Lomas Rishi rock cave in the Barabar Hills of Bihar, around the same period),19 in India. In a carving from Bharhut the tongue is shown to project from crocodile-like jaws.20 Later, the lotus rhizome, complete with flowers and leaves, was depicted emerging from the mouth. This concept developed in Sri Lanka, most expressively, in the Wing Slabs (koravak gal) of the steps leading to shrines in Anuradhapura, where the projecting tongue curved gracefully down to curl upward (distally) at the bottom, with sprouts of foliage embellishing it.21 However, the tongues of the makaru in the makara torana differ from this ar rangement, and curve up, carrying animals such as the lion, swan, serapendiya and even human lovers, with ginisilu or palâ-peti designs on the upper edges of the two tongues which terminate at the central expanded lotus ornament, or purima, which also receives the tongue that hangs from the kibihi face (above it). The kibihi, with quasi-leonine frontal facial expression, looks down on the world of the devotee, while receiving, through it's tongues and the purima, the animal and vegetable emanations of the tongues of the upward lookig (lateral) makaru. One type of extant makara sculpture has the kibihi face replaced by two makara heads turned away from each other;22 in a Guard Stone in Anuradhapura, lions and pairs of lovers fill in the united tongues on each side.23</page><page sequence="7">136 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MAKARA TORANA Dr. Paranavitana suggests that this depiction symbolises kala, or Time, which destroys and devours all beings.24 In Buddhist architecture there is a popular belief that in mid-ocean there is a large and fearsome makara to whose makara kata or jaws is drawn everything in its vicinity, to finally go into oblivion. The kibihi face may have originated from a Helenistic or, more likely, "Scyth ian" source.25 In the ruined Buddhist monuments of Java is a decorative structure called Kala-makara, similar to the makara torana, where two makaru are joined together by an unusual head, said to rep resent kala or Time, which takes the place of the kibihi face.26 In the course of time, the makara was conceived as a large leviathan animal that could accommodate even an elephant bet ween its jaws. Stone carvings in both India and Sri Lanka depict this association; the National Museum in Colombo has two granite specimens of large looking fish-tailed makaru. After several cen turies the fish tail of the makara was replaced by the flowery-feathered tail of a bird. When fully evolved, by the 6th century, a.d. (Tables 1 and 2), the makara consisted of the trunk of an elephant (for dexterity), the paws of a lion (for strength), the ears of a boar (for acute hearing), the body of a fish (for hydrodynamic manoeuvra bility), menacing teeth, projecting from the jaws of a crocodile (to instil respect and fear), the eyes of a monkey (for sharp vision) and the (exquisite) quasimythical tail of a bird (for surpassing beauty), (Plate 2a). The Rûpavaliya describes these features in graphic detail.27 "In the beginning this world was just water", and "all this world is woven, warp and woof, on water".28 Brahman declares that "the waters, verily, indeed, are my world". Water Cosmology thus relates to the belief in the aquatic origin of all life, which must have, naturally, been conceived by hydraulic civilizations that sprang along rivers like the Nile, Euphrates, Indus and the Ganges, where seasonal rains and the constant flow of rivers produced abundance, through agriculture. The erotically tinged belief that water was the source of rasa (essence), also identified with soma, madhu, surâ and shakti, can be traced to European folklore as well.29 "The image of Aphrodite rising from the sea is not without scientific justification".30 The natural emphasis, and the influence of the dei ties, of agricultural communities employing irrigation in the near</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL R.A.S. (SRI LANKA) Vol. XXXVI, (N.S.) 1991/92 137 India, even before the advent of the Aryans, were on vegetation.31 Indo-Lankan decorative art is expressively significant and exhibits styles relating to animals, plants and geometry. Vegetation is shown to spring from the: (a) mouth or navel of a deity or vehicle eg. makara, or (b) receptacle of abundance (pun kalasd), or (c) conch, but never from any entirely terrestrial symbol.32 The distinctive water symbols, lotus, makara and conch could only have become known to the Aryans after their arrival in India, and the use of this non-anthropomorphic symbolism is inherent^ indigenous.33 Motifs with two or more animals with a single head common to them or vice versa was part of a culture that arose in the later Stone Age among permanently settled agricultural communities which existed from Mohenjodaro and northern India to Egypt and the Mediterranean (Mesopotamia and Assyria) as early as the 4th millenium b.c.34 Yaksas, as tutelary deities, have intimate connections with water. As guardians, Yaksas bestow, but Nagas retain, rain, water and wealth.35 Kuvera's* 9 treasures include the inexhaustible lotus, makara and conch.36 Varuna, god of the waters, and godes ses including Ganga, have the makara or fish-tailed animals as vehicles.37 The Indian god of love Kâmadëva's insignia is the makara-Makaradvaja (the makara banner).38 The makara has been the emblem of the Bharatas of India,39 the Kurukula (branch of the Chandrakula races) of Maninagar (whose animal composi tion of the makara symbol was rather different from that des cribed in the Rûpâvaliya),40 and, the Karâva (Kurukulam) of the North, the East and Mantota in Sri Lanka.41 The Mukkara Hatana was a war fought and won under the (amphibian) makara banner.42 In the earliest mythology : "That germ which the waters held first and in which all the gods exist" rose like a tree, 'from the naval of the unborn".43 Varuna is one such deity.44 Havelock Ellis suggests that the modern scientific theory of the pelagic origin of life may be an extension of primordial Water Cosmology.46^5 In the Vedas, the older popular theory is in the origin of the world from Being, and Brahman is conceived as world-ground—in antithesis to Space Cosmology, where the origin of the world is from Non-being.46 * God of power productivity and plenty.</page><page sequence="9">138 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MAKARA TORANA Although astrological prognostications are abundant in human and mundane affairs, the zodiacal science is based on solar and planetary activity at the point indicated in the schematic illustra tion of our Milky Way Galaxy, which is spiral in shape (Figs. 1 and 2). The Sun, its nine planets and their satellites are all ac commodated within a minute locus near the inner edge of one of the spiral arms in our galaxy, which has millions of other similar solar systems. Modern astronomical understanding of the Universe really took shape in 1924 when the American astronomer, Edwin Hubble, demonstrated that ours is not the only galaxy.47 Over one hundred thousand million others are visible with modern teles copes, with each galaxy containing some hundred thousand mi llion stars.48 The Universe is ever expanding, physically, by bet ween 5 and 10 per cent every one thousand million years, and nearly all the neighbouring galaxies are moving away from us.49 The term Black Hole was coined in 1969 by the American John Wheeler to describe a massive star collapsing under its own gravity, until not even light can escape from it.50 A black hole is thus a cosmic abyss reminiscent of Oblivion. Stephen Hawking, one of the world foremost (space) cosmologists, regarded by many as the most bril liant theoretical physicist since Albert Einstein, writing "From the Big Bang to Black Holes" states that "the boundary condition of the universe is that it has no boundary"51 In terms of Space Cosmology, modern astronomy is demons trating the realization of aesthetic and abstract symbolism. Indeed we may be witnessing scientific palingenesis of makara symbolism. The ascent of the idealism of the votary through Samsara towards perfect existence through the upturned tongues of the two lateral makaru of the makara torana, for integration and harmonizing with the central purima—the expanded lotus motif representing the expanding universe, for deliverance vertically into the beaming but awe-inspiring kibihi above, is comparable to sublimation into eternity. In spiritual and philosophical terms, with the exaltation of pure thoughts and worship into and through the most superior com ponent of the makara torana—the kibihi os, eternal emancipation into a boundless and expanding universe, without being sucked into a Black Hole (Hell or Oblivion), is aspired and prayed for.

The word torana is derived from the Sanskrit "tura-tvarana, that which allows one to pass quickly from one place to another, a gateway.53 (But Sir. M .Monier Williams gives torana as derived from 'neck' (Latin).54 Thus the arch of the makara torana and other components and structures closely associated with it constitute a complex gateway and a thoroughfare complex. The several components of the most complete examples of such a complex are: a flight of steps the basal slab of which is usually an elaborately carved Moonstone (Plate 2b); on either side of the Moonstone are two explicitly sculp tured vertical Guard Stones with convex upper borders. On either side of the steps, behind the Guard Stones, are Wing Slabs (also called balustrades) which too are elaborately carved. Paranavitana, suggests that when a devotee approaching a shrine quickly crosses the Moonstone threshold, he enters the Path of Purity (the steps symbolize stages of samâdhi). The Wing Slabs (on either side) project from the landing which stretches far and represents knowledge (paññá) and leads the pious from time (kâla) to Timelessness. In Pah Kâla-kiriya (the action of Time) means death. The shrine beyond the makara torana that arches over the landing of the flight of steps symbolizes the dhamma which is Time less—akâlika. Within the shrine or sanctum the Buddha, who has transcended Time, looks down with Compassion (karunâ) which embraces all living things, and paññá which grasps everything, to enable the devotee, whose spiritual aspiration is to transgress the temporal world into timeless existence, to achieve Supreme Insight (vijjâ). 55 The Moonstone, and each Guard Stone, step and Wing Slab, are each classically hewn from monolithic granite of the most lasting quality. Traces of carving are retained on the oldest granite Moonstone, even after centuries of being trod by millions of devo tees and the curious. On either side of the uppermost step are two pillars with either a keystone spanning the space between the pillar tops or an arch of wood or other building material. The most awe-inspiring of such arches are the makara toran (plural) in which the arch has five curves (panchavaktra) resembling a bow</page><page sequence="13">140 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MAKARA TOR ANA upturned into the sky.56 In the gateway of Râvanâ's Capital in ancient Lanka was a wooden beam (daru) carved with the pancha vaktra motif57. The Kirtivaktra of the Gupta Period exhibited the kibihi face with large eyes, plump cheeks with wavy lines and elep hantine ears, symbolizing the divine power of warding off evil.58 kirti initially denoted an excavated rock-cut chaitya—hall,44 and a copper-plate inscription from Kanheri, India, dated 493, a.d. remains the oldest extant record of this meaning;59 Kirtimukha referred to the opening into the chaitya-hall.60 In Sunga (Bharhut) art S imsumara meant makara with the coiled tail and gaping mouth (karala-mukha), and Simsumara-sirah was synonymous with makara torana.61 The architectural specifications for the makara torana were stipulated later: that the height of the structure should be divided into 10, 9 or 8 equal parts, of which the 3 on top should be occupied by the spanning structure, and the rest by the two support ing pillars.62 The breadth of the arch could be half its height or 4-6 dandas.63 A crescent shaped arch decorated with leaves is called a paira torana.6* That which has a central ornament flanked by two alligator heads with open jaws whose tongues terminate in those of the makaru at each end of the arch, with decorative ad juncts such as goblins, celestial figures, animals, swans, pearl wreaths etc., is a chitra torana, and, that with five curves (panchavanka) and two makara figures is the makara torana.63 Kdsyapa Samhita also stipulates that the makara torana must have the two fish-like animals at the extremities.66 The central space-filling spiral or festoon is called the purima.61 After the 12th century, a.d. the space above the arch, on either side of the kibihi, were decorated with figures of Brahmanical guardian gods (lôkapâlas) including Indra (Sakra), Yama, Varuna and Kuvera. During the Kandyan Period some makara toran became massive and carried on top, the Buddhist Regents of the Four Quarters (sataravaran deviyo):6S Kuvera or Vaisravana (with a lion as the vehicle) for the North, Virudhaka or Skanda (on a bull) for the South, Indra or Dhrtarâshtra or Saman (on an elep hant for the East and Virüpaksha or Vibhishana (on a horse) for the West.69 With the time, number of gods increased to eight (the Four Regents, with the lesser deities subordinated), as evident at the 18th century Danagirigala and Wattârama shrines.70 The concept of Guardians of the Four Quarters is Babylonian as well as Indo-Lankan.71</page><page sequence="14">PLATE 3 (a) Lankatilaka Vihara Sanctum (b) Kelaniya Rajamaha Vihara</page><page sequence="15">PLATE 4 (a) Eastern Entrance, Datada Maligawa, Kandy (b) Asokaramaya Vihara, Thimbirigasyaya</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL R.A.S. (SRI LANKA) Vol. XXXVI, (N.S) 1991/92 141 That the makara torana instils both fear and respect, in the spiritual sense can particularly be observed in the 17th century Lankàtilaka Rajamaha Vihâra in Hiyarapitiya near Kandy, where the magnificient kibihi face above the serene samâdhi statue enthrals the devotee (Plate 3a). In this shrine there is a door frame which is unique, being of monolithic, but it is not a classical makara torana as the positions of the two lateral makaru have been taken by serapendiyo. Makara toran were also erected above small statues. Some were made of ivory or metals such as bronze, e.g. above Tara and Natarâj (Hindu) images. Small bronze makara toran from 8th century Anuradhapura.72 (One of which is in Cleveland, Ohio, USA),73 sheltered some metal Buddha images. Ward states that refinement and perfection of makara toran over and above else where in Asia was achieved by Sri Lankan craftsmen.74 Lôkapâlas ride the arabesque tails of the 2 makaru in his specimen.75 Above some metal statues makara toran were built of wood.76 Deco rative carvings with makara motifs are seen in the stone urinals and also in their granite back-slabs and wing-slabs, in some monas teries of Anuradhapura.77 These were not for veneration but rather for contemplation. During and after the Polonnaruwa period (from the 12th century, A.D.) Buddhist philosophy instilled new interpretations to the symbols and words of the Brahmanas.78 Symbols like makara, purima, kibihi (kala) have retained much of their pristine or vedic significance while attaining purification and perfection in meaning and interpretation, signifying transcendental wisdom. The makara torana on the Moonstone at the Beligala Vihâraya in Beligal korale is a subtle example of the use of the makara toran decoration (carving) in such a manner that the kibihi face is made to appear less conspicuous.79 This Beligala monolith is a supreme monument to spiritual philosophy, for, in the later Kandyan period makara and kibihi motifs on Moonstones were replaced by floral designs, with no more than remarkable resem blance to the original symbols. It is likely that these modified perfections were intended to avoid guilt and controversy from makara sculpture being desecrated by treading. Such Moonstones are extant at the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy and elsewhere. While the entrance to the sanctum with the reclining Buddha at the Kelaniya Raja Maya Vihara aptly has the classical makara torana, its exit has an almost identical torana with two lions in lateral view,</page><page sequence="17">142 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MAKARA TORANA with their faces turned outward, eracing the makara (Plate 3b). The firm leonine faces seem to warn the devotee that he may not enter the inner sanctum through the latter arch. Specimens of the earliest forms of fish-tailed makaru are seen in Buddhagayâ. The approximate chronology of the evolution of makara and pseudo-makara forms to classical makara toran that are extant is set out in Tables 1 and 2.
