<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHITECTURE Perspective on Contemporary Architecture Nancy Davis ( pOST-MODERN," a phrase coined a decade or more ago to describe a trend in architecture, has slipped into common usage. It has been applied in print in recent months to Gary Hart's economic policies, to Cajun nouvelle cuisine, and to the mooted return of the old Thunderbird car. To term something "Post-Modern," be it consumer durable or work of fiction, is to suggest a certain stylish revisionism, a witty or ironic intent. Implicit is a conscious distancing from mores incul- cated in the earlier part of this century. For architects who have kicked at if not kicked over the traces of the Bau- haus, to be "Post-Modem" is to reject or reinterpret a long-dominant ideology. With force of time and repetition, ideals which were galvanic when newly forged have come to seem mere incantations, learned by rote. The descriptive value of the term is relatively limited, though, as it illuminates a relationship to past works rather than to present endeavours. The Modem Movement began with the early villa designs and writings of Le Corbusier in France and the activities of the Bauhaus school in Germany. The Modernist aesthetic of easily replicated, unornamented forms was derived from new techniques of standardized pro- duction, informed by factory designs and by a fascination with the emerging technologies of steel, glass, and rein- forced concrete. The great architects of the Modernist avant-garde shared a faith in architecture as an instrument for social change. They believed that the beauty of a building should lie in the spaces created within it and the way in which these volumes were expressed upon the facade. Early Modernists were influenced by Cubism and the develop- ing abstraction in art. Heralds of a new science of building, they were motivated by an evangelizing socialism predicated upon the conviction that people could be morally uplifted by improved living and working conditions. Architects em- braced a new dogma whose catch phrases-"less is more," "iorm follows function," "a house is a machine for liv- ing in" (sic)--owed their legitimacy to their utopian aspirations. Since the First World War, progressive architects have been concerned with a single stream of architectural investiga- tion, albeit one with many tributaries and strange turnings. A line can be traced from Futurism through Con- structivism, the Bauhaus, and the Inter- national Style to High Modernism. These all partook of a Platonic belief in the benefits of stylistic and ideological purity, of an aesthetic of functionalism, and of certain social goals. Crucial to Modernist mythology is the image of the architect as culture hero, battling a philistine establish- ment, leading an untutored public to societal and artistic salvation. This may have its roots in the eighteenth-century German Romantic perception of the artist as iconoclast, the importance of whose labors could in some part be measured by the outrage they evoked. Howard Roark, the architect hero of Ayn Rand's popular novel The Foun- tainhead, embodied the high seriousness and vainglory of Modernist values. One may, however, infer a gap between myth and history here, as Modern architects did build extensively, transforming the face of most cities. In fact, the profession only really became embattled over the perceived failures of so many post-War recon- struction projects. These larded the landscape with anonymous, soon dilapi- dated high rises and housing develop- ments. The so-called "urban blight" of the 1950s and '60s caused the public to doubt that new buildings would auto- matically be better than those they replaced. This distrust led to a collective loss of confidence among architects, chronicled in numerous hectoring tomes bearing titles on the order of Form Fol- lows Fiasco and Crisis in Architecture. Yet the profession has lately risen phoenix-like from this self- and popular abasement. Architecture is back in fash- ion, or at least high-fashion architecture is selling again. Galleries exhibit draw- ings by architects who are themselves venerated with the cult status hitherto reserved for the pop stars of art. Books on the subject sell in unprecedented quantities, applications to architecture schools are up steeply, and famous practitioners are featured in adulatory television documentaries. The reasons for this rehabilitation are complex, but they must arise in some degree from a newly rediscovered capa- city on the part of architects to interpret contemporary culture satisfactorily and then reconstitute it in convincingly em- blematic ways. How this has happened merits consideration, especially as the range of acceptable styles is at once more diverse and more numerous than ever before. It is a truism to suggest that this multiplicity of architectural agendas reflects an equal variety within the Zeit- geist. What is less often discussed is the manner in which architects today pick and choose among styles from commis- sion to commission. While some designers maintain a clear line of progression from one building to the next, and a strongly recognizable aesthetic, others have made their name in no small part through flexibility. Robert A. M. Stern, once famed for all- white neo-Corbusian suburban houses, now builds in a modified Shingle style. The work of the award-winning firm Hardy, Holzman, Pfeiffer is memorable for an enviable artistic agility and for careful detailing, but can be identified with no single architectural vocabulary. This recalls the mid-nineteenth- century "Battle of the Styles," wherein the proponents of the Classical and the Gothic jockeyed for architectural pre- eminence. The former, analogous to Modernism, had long been the estab- lished aesthetic, yet the re-introduction of the Gothic caught the imagination of architects who saw in it the potential for a more nationalistic, emotional, and "honest" language of forms. Then as now, architects varied their design vo- cabularies not only in response to evolv- ing tastes, but also as part of their search for the most eloquent means of archi- tectural expression. For those who today choose to take advantage, there exists a freedom born of eclecticism. What is interesting about contemporary architecture is not just the broad span of issues which pre- occupy practitioners-from the engi- neering of complicated structures to un- buildable architectonic fantasies-but also the way in which architects draw so selectively from their heritage. Almost without exception, present- day architects have themselves been Modernists, or were taught by archi- tects schooled in Modern Movement theories. Indeed, they can often be easily understood through an examination of those aspects of Modernism which they elect to retain. Commercial fantasists such as Philip Johnson (himself once a leading propagandist for the Inter- national Style before turning apostate) take the Modernist aesthetic as a mute datum off which to play. The self- appointed heirs to the avant-garde stance, like New York Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies founder Peter Eisenman and Cranbrook Profes- sor Daniel Libeskind, maintain the Modernist ideal of the architect as cul- tural beacon while continuing its hard- edge formal vocabulary. Those inter- ested in deliberately client- and site- specific design are themselves reacting to Modernism's generalizing tendencies. Wit is another key to the appreciation of current building. Humor is a means of communication, of making architec- ture memorable to its users. It can range from the crude practical jokes of the hot dog stand shaped like a sausage roll to the careful shifts in scale and detail of the Italian Mannerists. Modernist build- ings are rarely funny, and when they are, the humor usually seems uninten- tional or obscure. The facade of New York's Seagram Building, designed by Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, is scored by seams made of steel 'I' beams. These are structural members deployed as decoration. The wit is sub- tle, unintelligible to those unfamiliar with the Modernist canon's command- ment against the dishonest use of materials. An important facet of the reaction against Modernism is the jokey quality of much new construction. SITE, a New York based firm, made its reputation designing showrooms for Best Products Company which startle and amuse the shopper. One such appears cracked, with a frozen cascade of bricks tumbling down its entrance front. Another's doors open when a ragged chunk of masonry is wrenched away from a cor- ner, as though tugged by some giant hand. These are jokes about entropy, facing up at once to the realities of structural decay. They risk the obvious danger of architectural wit-the build- ing does not disappear when the gag has palled. One way to evaluate architects is to consider the audiences at which their visual puns are aimed. Usually the wider their compass the more populist the designer and the less he or she is im- bued with Modernist dogma. On the other hand, the more the joke over- whelms the design, the more limited the purely architectural ambitions of the designer. A much-studied aspect of late nine- teenth- and twentieth-century art has been the successive nature of its avant- gardes. The lessons of the Impression- ists, who were ridiculed at first but later enshrined in the cultural pantheon, have taught critics avidly to search out the new. Instead of a placid, philistine pub- lic, we have one which endlessly awaits re-education: one which has learned to deny itself the suspicion that the Emperor might sometimes not be wear- ing clothes after all. This institutionalization of the avant- garde presupposes an elite model of cul- tural transfer, whereby the ideas of the vanguard ferment in relative isolation only to spring forth eventually, first to shock and then to infuse the public's taste. Avant-garde ideas must therefore become ever more recondite to be new at all. A hermeticism and opacity of presentation which maintains this dis- tance is thus a fundamental criterion for avant-garde architecture today. The Modernist avant-garde was probably at its most ambitious in the inter-war years. Then as now, it under- took a heroic attitude towards history, a deliberately arcane design method, and a pedagogic stance towards the public, This makes it all the more ironic that the most signlcrifcairAAmerican architec- tural project of the period was designed by engineers, not architects. The dams of the Tennessee Valley Authority met Modern Movement demands for struc- tural innovation, dramatically legible form, new materials, and a revolu- tionary social commitment. That earlier impetus to build which was felt by Modern Movement archi- tects has somewhat dissipated today. The contemporary avant-garde con- cerns itself more with linguistics than with construction. Influenced by semi- otics and certain aspects of conceptual art, these practitioners have made the autonomous development of their own architectural theories the subject of their work. The "content" of their designs is syntactic investigation of the meaning of architecture targeted for limited con- sumption by cognoscenti. In one sense the "avant-garde" is remarkably old- fashioned: it continues to define its social role according to Modernist formulae. Peter Eisenman's houses of the 1970s, for example, were numbered rather than named. Called "cardboard archi- tecture" by their author, these 1920s-inspired villas are constructed of planar white materials whose physicality is deliberately downplayed. The point of Eisenman's buildings is the refer- ences they make and the ideas they em- body. His has been an essentially man- nerist analysis of Modern Movement interests in the abstraction of form. Although Eisenman has recently ven- tured into commercial construction, it is his cerebral, introspective design 24 THE THREEPENNY REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">method which continues to attract a broad following. Daniel Libeskind carries this vein of inquiry one step further and several steps away from actual building. Like Eisenman, he is motivated by an inter- est in fracturing and reconstructing the grammar of architecture. His designs are highly elaborate, anecdotal doo- dlings, filled incident and implied spaces. They are not conventionally legible, resembling no specific building type. Libeskind's architecture is complete on paper-intended for publication rather than construction. Closer to the con- ceptual artist Sol le Witt than to Le Cor- busier, his 1983 Chamber Works defy formal analysis, at least for the time being. They are one apotheosis of Modern Movement iconography, how- ever fragmented. It remains to be seen whether they will lead other architects back to construction in new ways. While intellectual snobbery may characterize the current avant-garde, a corresponding egalitarianism is not always evident in the work of main- stream Post-Modernists. Multivalence, or simultaneous coding of buildings for specialist critic and average consumer alike, has struck many designers as a key to recapturing public enthusiasm without losing credibility among their peers. Since the language of Modernism lacked wide appeal, it seemed necessary to establish an alternative aesthetic. A great deal of lip-service has been paid to the cultural and anthropomorphic asso- ciations made with particular architec- tural elements, as for example that of the newly ubiquitous pitched roof with security and shelter. Handled sensitively, such symbolism can win easy recogni- tion, but the potential for condescension is ever-present. The overwhelming thrust of com- mercial construction is towards increas- ing uniformity of building systems and techniques. A certain resistance to this structural and stylistic homogeneity is evident in the work of those architects who today constitute a sort of rear- guard. Not a clubbable fraternity with the ideological cohesiveness that marks the avant-garde heirs of Modernism, they share no defined vocabulary. United instead by their disaffection with avant-garde exclusivity, they seek to make architecture idiosyncratic and personal. Theirs is an essentially inclusive aes- thetic. Robert Venturi, doyen of the anti-Modernists and author of the land- mark Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture, took issue with the Modernist "less is more," reposting "Less is a bore." He and other architects such as Stanley Tigerman and Frank Gehry attempt to reclaim the historic, scenographic, and cultural components of design as the proper subject of archi- tecture. What architects call "contex- tualism" means making the surrounding environment a major factor in design development. As in the eighteenth cen- tury, they pay homage to the "genius loci" or spirit of the place, an ambition inimical to the Modernist International- ism, which treats all sites as tabulae rasae and therefore inconsequential. When taken to extremes, this ap- proach produces facsimile architecture; most often its aim is reasonably sympa- thetic infill. Contextualist work is strongest where the designer has not succumbed to the notion that contem- porary architecture must be an act of appeasement, mirroring but not expanding the parameters of taste. It tends to involve the quotational use of pieces lifted either from adjoining struc- tures or from the grab bag of history. Undigested appropriation has its risks: pattern-book architecture not mediated by any compelling vision cannot hope to equal the original form which it copies. Whereas Modernist architects are har- rowed by the need to maintain a sui generis stance, denying even the most manifest influences, contextual archi- tects face accusations of pastiche. Rear-guard borrowing from history, local vernacular traditions such as adobe or clapboarding, and the architectural equivalent of slang-chain link fencing and galvanized tin siding-presupposes a desire to move the profession from the solipsistic arena of the avant-garde to a more accessible realm. It is not unusual to find traces of all three vocabularies in a single building. Yet if the rear-guard is pluralist, it must also retain an element of ambiguity in order to avoid a kind of crossword puzzle style whose clues do not add up to more than the sum of their parts. An early example of rear-guard con- cerns to exploit the evocative potential of building, though still within the lan- guage of Modernism, is J0rn Utzon's 1956 design for the Sydney Opera House. Its profile of cascading, hooked roofs and slightly luminous tile cladding connote sea birds or ships in full sail. The building reflects and enhances both the physical qualities of the harbor site and the civic aspirations of the city fathers who commissioned it. One cannot, however, automatically associate the Modernist aesthetic with the avant-garde and vernacular or his- toricist styles with the rear-guard. Not only do some projects share aspects of each-, but finally the aesthetic is less cru- cial than the architect's attitudes. For instance, Maya Lin's design for the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, a black stone wedge of wall incised with the names of all those who died in com- bat, is avant-garde in the confidence it portrays in abstraction as a meaningful, expressive gesture. Nevertheless, the relationship it establishes between the individual and the faceless masses, be- tween loss of life and the earth itself, is essentially democratic in orientation and therefore "rear-guard." On the other hand, Michael Graves's much- published Portland Office Building dis- plays a kind of low-budget scenographic allure that masks an otherwise conven- tional building typical of much specula- tive construction. Despite the decorated facades, the desire to include the users in any shared language of style is not particularly evident. The next great debate after the Gothic triumphed in the nineteenth-century "Battle of the Styles" arose over the issue of professional registration. Those who thought architecture first and fore- most an art argued against it, while the proponents of professionalism were in its favor. That question can easily be recast for contemporary practitioners: if art, then for whom? If profession, then how and in what manner art? It is worth remembering, though, that just as the nineteenth-century Gothic was overtaken first by the Arts and Crafts movement and then by a classical reviv- alism known as Neo-Georgian, so too the ambitions of Modernism may return in a different guise.
