<plain_text><page sequence="1">"In The Name of Annah": Islam and Salam in Joyce's Finnegans Wake Aida Yared Vanderbilt University "There are those who, when it was said to them There is no god but Allah,' behaved with insolence And said 'Should we abandon our gods for the sake of a mad poet?'" (Koran 37.35-36)1 "?Nansense, you snorsted? he was haltid considerable agenst all religions overtrow." (FW 326.21-22) The Islamic content of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake has received limited attention since James S. Atherton noted that the Koran, the holy book of Islam, was present at the Wake.2 Atherton sug gested that Joyce had used the Koran as a "telephone directory," referring to specific verses and concealing in his text the titles of the Koranic chapters or suras (209). Joyce's personal library did include a copy of the Koran, in the French translation by J. C. Mardrus.3 Though only its first thirty-two pages were cut open, extensive entries in the Buffalo Notebooks?espe cially 24 (JJA 34.438-42), 31 (JJA 36.196-210), and 45 (JJA 40.60-67)? provide convincing evidence that Joyce had a broad knowledge of Arabian history and tradition, including Islam's theology, rituals, and prohibitions. He had read the works of the Orientalists Sir Richard Burton and Stanley Lane-Poole and had scrutinized The Story of Mohammed, a biography of the Islamic prophet by Edith Holland, published in 1914.4 In keeping with Joyce's practice of marking mate rial as he integrated it into his "work in progress," a large number of the Notebook entries are crossed out (Figure l).5 Islamic elements are encountered throughout Finnegans Wake but cluster mainly in Chapters 1.1,1.3, IIL2, and IV and also in Chapter 1.5, which opens like a Koranic sura: "In the name of Annah" (FW 104.01). In this essay I will review the Islamic background and imagery of Finnegans Wak? and argue that Joyce is purposefully writing a trans gressive secular version of the sacred Koran. In it, he revises Islam's central messages, namely the belief in the unity of God and the need 401</page><page sequence="2">to surrender (the literal meaning of the word islam in Arabic) to His will and word. Joyce substitutes Annah,7 his own creation, for the Islamic god Allah. Using the model proposed by Ren? Girard that examines the origin of the sacred and its link to violence, I will sug gest that, in the Wakean myth, violence is central to the interaction of Joyce with Annah, as Joyce desacralizes Islam and appropriates it into the cyclical construct generated by ALP.8 The advent of peace (in Arabic, salam, the true aim of Islam) takes place with ALP's exit in the final pages of the book. The Historical Birth of Islam Before Islam, Arabia was a site of pagan polytheism. In Mecca, the center of Arabia's trade and religion, the favorite idols were Al-Ilah (a male) and his three daughters, Al-Uzza, Manat, and Al-Lat (men tioned by Joyce in JJA 40.64). There Mohammed was born, circa A.D. 570, the son of Abdallah and Aminah ("Ibdullin" and "Himana"?FW 309.13,14) and a member of the ruling tribe of Koreysh ("choruysh"? FW5.16). He initially earned his living as a tradesman organizing car avans for a rich businesswoman named Khadija. Alongside his work, he often prayed in solitude. He was nearly forty years old when, med itating in the cave of Hira near Mecca, he had a revelation. There, tra dition holds, he witnessed recurring apparitions of the archangel Gabriel who announced to him that he had been chosen as the Prophet of God. Gabriel gradually passed on to him, over a span of twenty-three years, the one hundred and fourteen suras of the Koran. Mohammed started preaching a new monotheistic religion, Islam. Its central tenet was the unity of God, summarized in the profession of faith or shahada: "There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is his Prophet." A doomsday would come, announced by Azrael, the blow er of the last trump ("Israfel the Summoner" and "Azrael"?FW 49.23, 258.07), when humans would be assigned either to the "left hand" and hurled into fire or to the "right hand," thus gaining eter nal beatitude (Koran 56:27-44, JJA 36.203). The right and left hands appear in Turkish in JJA 39.46 and in FW 357.05-06 as "dastychappy dustyrust." Mohammed soon had followers but also fierce opponents. Violence erupted when, in trying to rally his fellow Meccans, he propounded the belief that some pre-Islamic female deities were acceptable to Islam, then retracted it, claiming it was inspired by Satan.9 He later entered the area of the Kaaba shrine in Mecca and shattered in anger its 360 idols (JJA 36.197). This feat is duplicated in FW 128.31-33 by Finn McCool, who " clear [s] out three hundred sixty five idles to set up one all khalassal for henwives hoping to have males. "10 402</page><page sequence="3">Pressured by the Meccans to prove his supernatural vocation, Mohammed related a miraculous night journey on which he had been taken. Guided by Gabriel and carried by a winged horse, he had trav eled first to Jerusalem, then through all seven layers of the Islamic heaven, and had met face to face with an assembly of past prophets. This journey is mentioned in Koran 17:01, noted in JJA 36.205 ("from the sacred mosque to the furthest mosque"), and retold in FW469.08 11. Amidst turmoil, Mohammed fled to the city of Yathrib ("my youthrib city"?FW 318.25), now renamed Medina or City of the Prophet (Figure 2). This fleeing into exile, the Hegira, took place in the year A D. 622 and marked the beginning of a new Islamic calendar. The term "hejirite" appears in the Wake at FW62.03 and "Hegerite" at FW 274.10. The population of Medina included the muhajirun, who had fled from Mecca with Mohammed, and the local converts, called ansars or helpers ("ansars helpers"?FW5.25). There, Mohammed organized the new community and laid down its rules. In the tenth year of Islam, he undertook a pilgrimage, or hajj, to Mecca. By then, he had 140,000 disciples. On the plain of Arafat ("arafatas"?FW 5.15) adja cent to the city, he preached for the last time. The central verse of the Koran, where "Me" refers to Allah, was revealed on this occasion: "Do not fear the unbelievers, fear Me. Today, I have perfected your system of belief, and chosen Submission^al-Islam) as your creed" (Koran 5:03). In Joyce's Notebooks, we find these definitions "Muslim = resigned/Islam = surrender" (JJA 36.205). "Pillarbox": The Pillars of Islam in Finnegans Wake Islam was laid out by Mohammed as a highly structured system, with rules and regulations detailing religious rituals, secular interac tions, and the rights of women. Islam is, at heart, a return to the orig inal simplicity of the desert. Every aspect of the Moslem's social life is sanctified by perpetuating the traditions issued directly from Mohammed's revelation and the example of his personal conduct. It has five main arkan or pillars, all of which are revised throughout the Wake where the Koran is referred to as the "pillarbox" (FW 442.33). The first and central tenet of Islam is the shahada: "There is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is his Prophet." To convert to Islam, one needs only recite the shahada before the proper number of witnesses. Islam integrated the Arabs into the extended monotheistic communi ty of Judaism and Christianity: Abraham is considered to be the founding father of Islam, and the Arabs are the progeny of his first born son Ismael, conceived by his Arabian slave Hagar; until 403</page><page sequence="4">Mohammed, they had been outside the Covenant and without a sacred book. But Islam took Biblical monotheism a step further, affirming the unity of God (the "onesomeness" of the Mookse?FW 152.19). Allah is one and uniquely God with no associates, no consort or "partner" (JJA 36.201), no "sons or daughters" (Koran 6:100). The greatest sin of Islamic orthodoxy is shirk or "association," in effect, giving to anyone or anything even the smallest share in Allah's sov ereignty (Koran 4:115 and 24:55). Mohammed abhorred any fragmen tation of God, such as that exemplified in the Christian trinity, a con cept that he fiercely militated against (Koran 5:73). He also rejected any anthropomorphism of God (God as father or shepherd) as may occur in the Bible. Allah is not a "being"; he exists for man only through His word, the increated and eternal Koran. Joyce will undo this unity into plurability. The Islamic profession of faith takes the form of an exception with in a universal negation (there is no god except Allah), stressing the transcendence of Allah: creatures cannot prove or probe the mystery of divine existence but can only reflect it in their own nonexistence. For Islam, the "word" (Allah's word) is the only proof of human thought and human existence. Moslem children are taught from an early age to memorize entire passages of the Koran. Joyce will counter the divine origin of the Koran with the unmistakably human origin of his own writing. Islam is, to its adherents, a state of peace in surrender. The believer separates himself from the world around him so as to entrust his soul to Allah, thereby creating a permanent contradiction between himself and the world; in return, he gains divine peace or salam (a word that comes from the same etymological root, SLM, as Islam). I will later expand on Joyce's use of these concepts. The second pillar is salat or worship. The faithful are summoned to prayer by a chant (adhan), repeated by a crier (a muezzin?Figure 3) standing on the tower (minaret) of every mosque (Koran 3:193). The imagery of the minaret recurs in the Wake as one of the many unstable structures (including also the seven-layered Islamic heaven, the scaf folding of the master builder, and the ladder of the Egyptian God Osiris) that reproduce the tower of Babel and that the characters of the book attempt to erect and to climb only to tumble down (Figure 4). The adhan starts with "Allah is greatest" repeated four times, fol lowed by the shahada, "There is no god but Allah," repeated twice. The adhan is intended to distract a person away from the material world and remind that person of the presence and unity of God. Reality is an illusion (akin to the temptation of Christ) that one rejects to worship God alone. Upon hearing the adhan, every Moslem should interrupt any activity that he or she is engaged in and pray. 404</page><page sequence="5">In FW 310.22-311.04, we find a muezzin loudly broadcasting a sacri legious message,11 the uncapping of a bottle of beer. The message begins as follows: House of call is all their evenbreads though its cartomance halluci nate like an erection in the night the mummery of whose deed, a lur of Nur, immerges a mirage in a merror, for it is where by muzzin messed for one watthour, bilaws below, till time jings pleas, that host of a bottlefilled, the bulkily hulkwight, hunter's pink of face, an orel orioled, is in on a bout to be unbulging an o'conneli's, the true one. (FW 310.22-28) The passage refers to the Koranic sura 24, entitled Nur (or Light). Nur is one of the names of Allah, for he is "the light of heaven and the earth. The semblance of His light is that of a niche in which is a lamp, the flame within a glass. God guides to His light whom He will" (Koran 24:34-35). The central verse of the sura speaks of the illusory nature of reality, using the parable of a thirsty man: "As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are like a mirage in the desert which the thirsty takes for water till he reaches it to find there was nothing, only God with him" (Koran 24:39). This imagery is used in the scene above in the Wake, which takes place simultaneously on two levels, religious and pro fane. The "house of call" is both a mosque and a pub, erected in the middle of the desert and luring passersby with its light. "Lur of Nur" may imply the hollow enticement of religion. Rather than seeing the mirage dispelled, one "immerges" in it as in a mirror, in effect, immersing in it and emerging on the other side. The message of the muezzin is "muzzinmessed," at the same time an Islamic call to prayer and a "messe" or Christian religious service, the muezzin loudly bel lowing the bylaws ("bilaws below") of the "host" or the barman. He is "on a bout" of drinking until closing time, opening ("unbulging") a bottle of "o'connell" (a brand of Irish ale) and divulging its message. The "orel" is the ear of the host (oreille in French), possibly O'Reilly's, described in great detail on the preceding page and "orioled," sur rounded by an aureole or halo. The contents of the bottle of O'Connell is the message of Allah, received by "al Siddek," the true one and an early convert to Islam (JJA 40.62). The sound of the uncapping and pouring is detailed: "When, pressures be to our hoary frother, the pop gave his sullen bulletaction and, bilge, sled a movement of catharic emulsipotion down the sloppery slide of a slaunty to tilted lift-ye landsmen. Allamin" (FW 310.35-311.02). The publican, transgressing the unity of Allah, is a religious figure, at the same time an elder holy father ("hoary frother"), a Roman Catholic Pope promulgating a bull ("the pop gave its sullen bulletaction"), and Mohammed, who was 405</page><page sequence="6">known as "Al-Amin" or the Faithful ("Allamin"?JJA 40.62). Overall, the thirsty man of the Koran, instead of dispelling the mirage and, still thirsty, finding God by his side, comes in the Wake to a bar and will quench his thirst with beer. The message captured and transmit ted by the muezzin is an invitation to drink. The "bottlefilled," at the same time Allah's light within a niche and an excess of liquor, has turned into a battlefield for the sacred and the profane. Still, the pas sage preserves the illusory nature of the whole scene, as "mummery" and "hallucinate" suggest; the "house of calls" possibly belongs in the tarot cards ("cartomance"). Islamic prayer has to follow prescribed rules, lest it be invalidated. It requires specific gestures that come in the Wake as "nod, bend, bow and curtsey, like the watchers of Prospect" (FW 476.10-11). It should also be preceded by ablutions to purify the body (Koran 5:06): "They say their salat, the madiens' prayer to the messiager of His Nabis, prostitating their selfs eachwise and combinedly. Fateha, fold the hands. Be it honoured, bow the head. May thine evings e'en be bloss ful! Even of bliss! As we so hope for ablution. . . . (allahlah lahlah lah!)" (FW234.36-235.08). The "madien" is a female maiden muezzin, and the word "messi ager" combines the messenger with a messiah. "Nabi" is Arabic for Prophet. "May thine evening be blessed" and "[ejvening of bliss" are commonly used Arabic greetings. The Islamic scene of prayer is, at the same time, the Annunciation by the archangel Gabriel to the Blessed Virgin Mary that she will bear the Messiah and an act of pros titution ("prostitating") as she folds her hands and bows her head. The Koran says of the Blessed Virgin Mary: "Remember her who pre served her chastity and into whom We breathed a life from Us" (Koran 21:91), noted down by Joyce as "BVM's consent necessary/Gabriel parted BVM's shift and breathed (Koran)" (JJA 29:103). The scene also conjures up a blushful, unclothed Eve in "[m]ay thine evings be blossful," bloss meaning naked in German. Islam, Christianity, and Genesis seem to end in what may be the melody of a song, "Allah la la la," an incantation reminiscent of a mystic Sufi trance. The Muslim is required to pray five times in a day (Koran 4:103). The prescribed schedule is mentioned in JJA 36.206 as "after sun set/nightfall/daybreak/afternoon/middle afternoon" (Figure 5) and in the Wake, as follows: "Stay us wherefore in our search for tight eousness, O Sustainer, what time we rise and when we take up to toothmick and before we lump down upown our leatherbed and in the night and at the fading of the stars!" (FW5.18-21). The faithful must turn during prayer towards a qibla or focal point (Koran 2:144). Mohammed at first designated Jerusalem as the qibla; 406</page><page sequence="7">later, to set the Moslems apart from the Jews and the Christians, he moved it to Mecca, the site of the Kaaba, a cube-shaped stone that was already in pre-Islamic times a site of pagan pilgrimage. The Kaaba, possibly a fallen metorite, is thought to have been initially white in color and to have darkened with time by human touch and human sin. Finnegans Wake foregrounds Finnegan as Mohammed: "Our cube house still rocks as earwitness to the thunder of his arafatas but we hear also through successive ages that shebby choruysh of unkalified muzzlenimiissilehims that would blackguardise the whitestone ever hurtleturtled out of heaven" (FW5.14-18). The shabby chorus is from Koreysh (Mohammed's tribe) and is made up of Moslems unqualified and unfit to be caliphs, who guard ("blackguardise") the heavenly stone. Elsewhere Joyce dis-orients Islam, shifting its qibla around to a mosque in Moscow, "turning his fez menialstrait in the direction of Moscas" (FW83.36-84.01), then seeing his own person "to look most prophitable out of smily skibluh eye" (FW 240.32-33).12 The fez is a Middle Eastern felt cap, and Joyce may himself have bought one (LettersI 381). The Kaaba comes elsewhere in the Wake as the "kab bakks alicubi" paired with Ali, the name of Mohammed's cousin and as the "cubical crib" of Mamalujo (FW34.08, 476.32?Figure 6). The third pillar of Islam is sawm or fasting, required during the holy month of Ramadan (JJA 36.206). By abstaining from food (as well as from drinking, smoking, sexual intercourse, or any evil deed or act), the believer willingly recreates the condition of the man in the desert, hungry and thirsty, abandoned to\he mercy of Allah. Sawm starts at dawn, when one can distinguish a white thread from a black, and ends at dusk (Koran 2:185-87). HCE spends this time transgres sively drinking. Representing the gamut of paganism, Christianity, and Islam, the many pubs that he patronizes include a trinity: the Sun, the Holy Lamb, and "Ramitdown's ship hotel since the morning moment he could dixtinguish a white thread from a black" (FW63.25 26). The fourth pillar of Islam is the zakat or giving of alms to support "the orphans, the needy the wayfarers" (Koran 2:43, 215). HCE, like Mohammed, flees into exile but changes his name and leads a shame ful life: "He had fled again (open shunshema!) this country of exile" and "was even now occupying, under an islamitic newhame ... a physical body ... in Asia Major"; there "he had bepiastered the buik danseuses," which means that he squandered his piasters (a Middle Eastern currency) on belly dancers and "bepestered the bumbashaws for the alms of a para's pence" or pestered officers (bumbashaws) for charity (FW 98.04-05, 07-10, 11-12, 13-14). The change of name is nec essary since HCE is pretending to be a Moslem convert. Several European Orientalists were able to visit the holy sites of Islam only in 407</page><page sequence="8">disguise and after assuming Islamic identities (for example, accord ing to F. E. Peters, in The Hajj, Burton adopted the name of Hajji Abdullah and John Lewis Burckhardt that of Hajji Ibrahim?338). Shem, in turn, instead of paying the zakat, spends his money gam bling in an "incomeshare lotetree" (FW 191.18). This lottery, in which he seems to be winning, takes place in hell where, the Koran says, the unbelievers will fill their bellies from the bitter fruit of Zakum, a thorny "lotetree" that grows out of a bottomless pit (Koran 56:52 ? JJA 36.203). The last pillar of Islam is the hajj or "greater pilgrimage," a highly ritualized and complex visit to the various sites of the holy land (Koran 2:196-200). Its details occupy several pages of the Notebooks (JJA 34.439-42). Each physically and financially able Moslem is required to complete the hajj at least once in a lifetime; nowadays, it is performed by some two million believers every year. It represents a profession of belief in the One God. It is also an expression of the unity of all the believers and will collectively bring the forgiveness of their sins (Figure 7). Disrupting the order and unity of the hajj, Joyce separates the pilgrims into two rugby teams fighting for the ball dur ing a scrum: "when we are making pilscrummage . . ., Heavyscius gardaddy, parent who offers sweetmeats, will gift uns his Noblett's surprize" (FW 305.32-306.04). The recompense that he anticipates for such a disruption is candy from a "sugardaddy " god and no less than the Nobel prize, the ultimate recognition for a writer. HCE also per forms the umra or "lesser pilgrimage" (FW 51.29). On the way back from the pilgrimage, at the valley of Mina ("veils of Mina"?FW 318.18), it is customary to cast seven stones of a pre scribed size and provenance to pelt the devil (JJA 34.442). This cere mony, thought to originate with Abraham, is replaced in the Wake by pelting the Koran with dung, "studding cowshots over the noran" (FW 37.23). The reward of the Moslem who follows the right path during life is naym or paradise (Koran 52:17). HCE, as "Humme the Cheapner, Esc," is "worthy of the naym," despite the fact that he is bloated and "innebbiated" (drunk), and will "ultimendly [be made] respunchable for the hubbub caused in Edenborough" (FW 29.18-19, 19, 29-30, 35 36). In other words, he may have caused the original fall in the gar den of Eden. "Ultimendly" suggests that the naym and Eden may rep resent the same garden, where both genesis and the doomsday simul taneously take place. The two "ends" of Allah's design are joined, in a flagrant departure from the linear construct of Islam, where "to God belong the End and the Beginning" (Koran 53:25). The Islamic paradise is detailed in the Koran as a "blissful garden" where the believers "would recline on couches set in rows" (Koran 408</page><page sequence="9">52:20). A large number of houris, virgin nymphs with large black eyes (Koran 44:54), would be allocated to each. The Ondt, "boundlessly blissfilled in an allallahbath of houris," is bathing with the celestial nymphs and being put to sleep ("allallahbath") by their lullabies about Allah (FW 417.27-28). This erotic imagery of the naym is trans formed into a sheol or hell where the houris are disgusted by a promiscuous HCE: "whole continents rang with this Kairokorran lowness! Sheols of houris in chems upon divans, ... at a bare (O!) mention of the scaly rybald exclaimed: Poisse!" (FW 177.09-12). Again the extremes, here of heaven and hell, are collapsed. Elsewhere, we find HCE mocking and frightening the community of women (harem) as he spends his "strenth amok haremscarems" (FW 102.25). The Transgressive Male Writer (s) Clearly Mohammed and the caliphs (who succeeded him as the leaders of the Islamic faith) figure among the shifting identities of the male protagonists of the Wake: HCE, Finn McCool, Finnegan, Shem/Shaun, and the writer himself. In the Notebooks, we find the sigla of HCE equated with "muslim" (JJA 31.270), with "Mohammad/Ana oummi/illetro" (JJA 31.294?Figure 8), with "Mohammed part of revelation" (JJA 34.16), and with "mohamedan" (JJA 33.329). Joyce notes, "Allah 99 lovely names, 2 at a time" (JJA 36.210). The Koran actually refers to Allah by a number of "beautiful names" (Koran 59:24).13 Several appear in the Waice, such as the "Sustainer" (FW5.18-19), the "One" (FW52.13), the "Compassionate" (FW52.13), "Amin" (FW 139.28), and "Nur" (FW 310.24). But, according to tradi tion, Allah's greatest name can only be revealed to the favorites of heaven, and only He has knowledge of its meaning. In contrast, HCE has a "long list (now feared in part lost) ... of all abusive names he was called" (FW 71.05-06) that were "put under him" as "bynames" (FW29.32, 31). And although " [ojnly the caul knows his thousandfirst name," HCE's ultimate name is "Hocus Crocus, Esquilocus" (FW 254.19, 20), obviously in the public domain. But even spelled out for all to read, it still is a "secret" formula reminiscent of the "hocus pocus" that magicians utter; Allah may be an illusion that sleight-of hand can conjure. Shem, a major alter ego of the writer, tries "to look most prophitable out of smily skibluh eye"; "prophitable" alludes to the Prophet Mohammed ("smile of prophet" is noted in JJA 35.218 and 37.1214), as well as to Joyce's habit of borrowing material from other writers. "Skibluh" refers to the reported color (sky blue) of Joyce's 409</page><page sequence="10">eyes and to the qibla, the focal point of Islamic pilgrimage and prayer, which Joyce spelled as kiblah ("= Pt to which prayer is said"?JJA 36.206). Elsewhere, Shaun additionally comments, "We are all eyes. I have his quoram of images all on my retinue, Mohomadhawn" (FW 443.01-02); "retinue" is both the retina of the eye and Robert of Retina who translated the Koran into Latin. Thus, the visual outlook of the writer seems reflected through an Islamic perspective in an elaborate game of projected shadows (diagrammed in JJA 31.270) where the screen is the seeing eye of a Mohammedan HCE. Joyce may have thought of himself as writing a "sacred" book in the tradition of the Koran.15 The narration of the Wake states that "its page cannot ever have been a penproduct of a man or woman of that period" (FW 108.30-32). This echoes Mohammed's argument that the proof of the Koran's divine and miraculous origin is that it "is not such a writ as could be composed by anyone but God" (Koran 10:37). Mohammed repeatedly challenged his listeners to bring forth even one sura such as the Koran contains, confident that even "if men and Jinns get together, they will not be able to produce the like of it" (Koran 17:88). The inimitability (ijaz) of the Koran's "perfect lan guage" (JJA 31.296)?that Joyce is trying to emulate?was later to became a central doctrine in Islam. The "Doublends Jined" of the "alcohoran" There is a paradox here since Joyce did, in fact, write the book that "cannot ever have been a penproduct of a man." He refers to it as "the book of Doublends Jined (may his forehead be darkened with mud who would sunder!) till Daleth, mahomahouma, who oped it closeth thereof the. Dor" (FW20.15-18). The words "Doublends Jined" evoke several possibilities. They can be read as Dublin's Joyce, for the new Koran is Irish and "|j]ined" was initially spelled by Joyce as "|j]oynt" (JJA 40.60). They may also refer to the two ends of the Wake joined into the same sentence. "Doublends" evokes the endless twinning of the Wake's elements, "doublin their mumper all the time" (FW3.08-09) to create a multiplicity in opposition to the Islamic concept of Unity. Finally, "|j]ined" suggests the alliance of the human with the Jinns, the spirits of the Islamic demonology, born of smokeless fire, who will help with the writing. "May his forehead be darkened with mud" is an imprecation that Mohammed was famous for using. "Daleth" is the anagram of Deltah, the sigla of ALP, which has the extra "h" because it refers to Anna as Annah. In Joyce's notes, we find "Koran/delta at end" (JJA 31.294?see Figure 8). In "oped it," the verb is "op," the abbreviation for "opus." Joyce's "Doublends Jined" book is the work of delta or ALP. She also "oped" or opened it and 410</page><page sequence="11">will decide when to close the door. Meanwhile, everyone is asked to "[d]or" (in French, the imperative of the verb to sleep). In Islamic tradition, Peters notes in his Reader, one cannot counter feit Allah's creation and should not try to penetrate the mystery of His creative act (260). Any artistic figuration is an assault on divine tran scendence, hence the Islamic prohibition against depicting living creatures. Instead, Islam perfected calligraphy as a major form of art. The Arabic script is extensively used for ornamentation on walls, fur niture, and utensils, adorned with diacritical marks and decorative strokes. From such display is derived the word "arabesque," which is suggested in " [s]ay it with missiles then and thus arabesque the page" (FW 115.03). Chapter 1.5 (with its Islamic opening) is intensely concerned with the writing technique of the Wake and contains various elements relat ed to the Koran and to the Arabic script. The hand that wrote the Wake is "possibly ambidextrous" (FW 107.10-11); in Islamic tradition, Jeffery notes, "the two hands of Allah are both right hands," and the first thing He created was a pen "with which He wrote this present world and all there is in it" (151); Arabic is written from right to left, and many palindromes occur in the Wake (both words and events, including Shaun's reverse trip up the river Liffey). The ambidexterity may also undo the discrimination into "right" and "left" hands that characterizes the Islamic judgment day. The pages of Shem's manuscript have elaborate illuminations that include "jaywalking eyes," the wandering "i's" or eyes of James Joyce, and the double initial J of his name; letters are "unconnected, principial, medial or final, always jims in the jam" (FW 121.17, 18). "Jim" is both the Arabic letter "j" and a diminutive for James. The use of the word "unconnected" derives from the fact that, in Arabic writ ing, the shape of a letter varies by whether it is written by itself or in relative position to other characters within a word (Figure 9). It is tempting to think that Joyce was looking at a page with Arabic letter ing when he wrote the following: "it is not a miseffectual why acinthinous riot of blots and blurs and bars and balls and hoops and wriggles and juxtaposed jottings linked by spurts of speed: it only looks as like it as damn it" (FW 118.28-31?see Figure 10). In Joyce's book, "the world, mind, is, was and will be writing its own wrunes for ever" (FW 19.35-36), suggesting that the rules are (in) ruins and occult runes are in ancient characters. The work will be the first in print, having been issued by "Gutenmorg" (Gutenberg, who invented printing), who "must once for omniboss step rubrickredd out of the wordpress," stop the press and step out blushing when he glances at its contents, "else is there no virtue more in alcohoran" (FW 20.07, 08-10). The Koran, the "book" par excellence, is replaced by a 411</page><page sequence="12">"great primer" (FW 20.08) of incoherence and alcohol. A central interdiction of Islam is that of drinking, which is contin ually transgressed in the "alcohoran" where the bismillah is repre sented as "Bushmillah" (FW 521.15) and combined with the Bushmills brand of Irish whiskey. The same treatment is given to the motto of the French revolution, "libert?, ?galit?, fraternit?," which becomes "lebriety, frothearnity and quality" (FW 133.31-32), deriving from drunkenness (in French, ?bri?t?) and the frothy quality of beer. An initial symptom of drunkenness is seeing double. HCE drinks during Ramadan "since the morning moment he could dixtinguish a white thread from a black" (FW 63.25-26). The sentence refers to the confusion of black and white, the blurring of identities that sunrise will later dissipate. The Author and the Writer The Koran was not written down by Mohammed for he was unable to read or write?an "illetro" notes Joyce (JJA 31.294?Figure 8). It was gathered by his followers from fragments that had been memo rized or jotted down. The "paper" used consisted of "palmleaves, pebbles, shoulderbones, skins" (JJA 31.294?Figure 8). This notion will come in the Wake as "[a] bone, a pebble, a ramskin. . . . For that (the rapt one warns) is what papyr is meed of, made of, hides and hints and misses in prints" (FW 20.05-11), where it is combined with a reference to sura 74 entitled "The Wrapped One." The definitive text of the Koran was agreed upon long after Mohammed's death, during the time of Uthman, the third caliph. The collected record of Mohammed's sayings and deeds, or hadith, was a subject of intense scrutiny by Islamic religious authorities. Compilations of hadith are found by various authors, those by al Bukhari (810-70 A.D.) and Muslim bin Hajjaj (circa 817-75 A.D.) being deemed the most reliable. To ensure the veracity of a fragment's ori gin, scholars had to be able to trace it, through an uninterrupted chain (isnad) of solid witnesses, back to a close companion of the prophet. Peters cites Ibn Khaldun in noting that authentication required knowledge of "the chain of transmitters, the individual transmitters, their names, how the transmission took place," as well as ascertain ment of each witness's "probity, accuracy, thoroughness, and lack of carelessness" (223). In the Wake is found such an isnad at 193.17-28: "I had it from Lamppost Shawe. And he had it from the Mullah" (FW 193.17-18), the mullah being an Islamic scholar, a "schoolmaster" (JJA 35.218). But the chain is fanciful and goes on to include a confused Catholic con fession and blatantly unreliable sources: "And Mull took it from a 412</page><page sequence="13">Bluecoat schooler. And Gay Socks jot it from Potapheu's wife. And Rantipoll tipped the wink from old Mrs Tinbullet. And as for she was confussed by pro-Brother Thacolicus" (FW 193.27-28). The passage then harks back to scatology as "the good brother feels he would need to defecate you" (FW 193.22-23). Sensing the desecration, the speaker is quickly hushed: "Sh! Shem, you are. Sh! You are mad!" (FW 193.27-28). The Arabic word for "mad" is "majnun," which literally means possessed by a Jinn. The Koran speaks of the poet as a sooth sayer, a "majnun" with "confused dreams" (Koran 21:05) inspired by the Satan Iblis, a rebellious Jinn (Koran 26:221-26). Furthermore, Islamic tradition holds that the Koran was not con ceived by Mohammed. It was imparted to him by Allah through Gabriel, and several versions of the event are reported in the hadith with minor variations. In the one by Mohammed's main biographer Ibn Ishaq, as quoted in Peters, the revelation started when Mohammed was asleep, and Gabriel awoke him and ordered, "Read!" to which command Mohammed, being illiterate, replied at first, "I do not read"; but the angel shook him three times and said, "Read, in the name of your Lord who created, who has taught by the pen," words that Mohammed later repeated and that became 96.01 in the Koran (51). This story of the origin of the Koran is combined in the Wake with a fragment from the Islamic version of Genesis. After Allah gave life to Adam as a gigantic figure, he said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam," and they all bowed down except Iblis, the rebellious Jinn, who protested, "What? Shall I bow before him whom You created from clay?"; the event is retold several times throughout the Koran (15:32-33, 17:61-62 and 38:71-74). The Wake contains compelling advice: " (Stoop) if you are abced minded, to this daybook, in this allephbed! Can you rede (since We and Thou had it out already) its world? It is the same told of all. Many Miscegenations on miscegenations. . . . The meandertale, aloss and again, of our old Heidenburgh in ^h? days when Head-in-Clouds walked the earth" (FW 18.17-24). In the narrative of the Koran, no other voice but Allah's is heard in direct discourse: "We" always refers to Allah and "you" to the target audience. Lane-Poole points out that Joyce's Notebooks have the following entry: "We = God/Thou = M[ohammed]/Ye = People" (JJA 36.200?25). The Koran was writ ten in the Arabic language, the alphabet of which, like Hebrew, starts with the letters aleph and bet. The addressee is asked to "stoop" (like Iblis) to a human creature and "read" (like Mohammed) a sacred work. "This daybook, this alle phbed" is at the same time the "daybook" and "alphabet" of a human Adam, and the "allephbed" is the bed of ALP the river. Displacing the 413</page><page sequence="14">Creation by a supreme being, and itself created by a human, the writ ten word (alphabet) becomes a "world." It is the "meandertale, aloss and again," telling us that its content is the river flow of the Liffey in its allephbed, logos at its origin, summing up a lifetime, lost and renewed. It starts far back in prehistory, for the Heidelberg man is a relic of the stone age and the "meandertale" the Neanderthal era. It encompasses the "loss" in "Heidenburgh," a primordial garden of Eden. "Head-in-Clouds" evokes the Islamic Adam whose feet were initially on the ground, but his head was high in the sky. The genesis of man is the genesis of writing, and the "miscegenations" are fusing the divine, the archangels, the demons, and the human into a single authorial pen. Joyce substitutes Annah for Allah, making her the true originator of the text. While the Koran has 114 suras, Annah "confined herself to a hundred eleven, wan bywan bywan_Olaph lamm et, all that pack" (FW201.29-31).16 The text of most Koranic suras is preceded by strings of sacred letters of mysterious and much debated significance; thir teen suras start with "aleph lam," the Arabic letters equivalent to A and L (Figure 11). "Olaph lamm" and the word that follows closely, "pack," feature first letters that spell the initials of A.L.P. But while she is the author, the enscripting is taken over by the writing hand of Joyce. Allah and Annah: The Fatiha of Finnegans Wake All Koranic suras, save the ninth one, remind the reader/listener that the text to follow comes "[i]n the name of Allah the all-Merciful, the Compassionate." This is the fatiha (literally in Arabic, opening), better known in the West as the bismillah from its original Arabic form: "Bismillah al-rahman al-rahim" (see the cover illustration). In the Notebooks, we find the fatiha equated with "guidance &amp; help" (JJA 36.201) and spelled out as "bismi-llahi-r-rahman-r-rahim" (JJA 36.202). In keeping with the Islamic practice of zikr (in Arabic, remem brance), which consists of repeating invocations to Allah or simply His name throughout the course of the day, the fatiha makes numer ous intrusions in the Wake (FW 292.n3, 353.02, 357.04, 497.04 and 521.15). The central one comes in at the beginning of Chapter 1.5, when we are poised to listen, inebriated, "as she bibs us, by the waters of babalong" (FW 103.10-11): "In the name of Annah the Allmaziful, . . . the Bringer of Plurabilities, haloed be her eve, her singtime sung, her rill be run, unhemmed as it is uneven!" (FW 104.01-03). This corrupted fatiha unsettles the reader, for the phonetics of the "a" vowel in the Arabic "Allah" and the English "Annah" dif fer, as do the sexes of the combined characters. The word "allmaziful" 414</page><page sequence="15">contains the traditional descriptive of the Islamic god as "all Merciful" but also the maze of ALP's plurability and the Arabic word "allmaz," which means diamonds.17 Allah is feminized and "full of diamonds," recalling the Ave Marias "full of grace." Mary/Annah is ALP, the "Bringer of Plurabilities," and wears a halo in the Christian pictorial tradition ("haloed be her eve"), but "eve" is spelled with a lower case "e" to represent every woman. The feminization is imme diately disrupted; in "haloed be her eve, her singtime sung," we also find "Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy kingdom come," borrowed from the Christian prayer to a masculine Lord. With "her rill be run," Annah turns into the river Liffey that starts as a "rill" (a small brook) soon to swell into a river. However, her rill is "run," the word "run" linking with Annah's worry about the "uneven" length of her "unhemmed" skirt. While Islam affirms monotheism and the unity of God, the Wake's fatiha grafts onto its deity Annah/Allah several figures including ALP, the Virgin Mary, Eve, and the Christian Lord. Annah/Allah is further fragmented into plurability Joyce is commiting shirk or association, the gravest of Islamic sins. Why make Allah a female? The gesture, in part, denounces phallo centrism and decanonizes a male God: "why spell dear god with a big thick dhee?" (FW 123.01-02). It briefly connotes a return to pre-Islamic matriarchal cults, when Al-Lat was a favorite goddess, and to the time of Eve when "[fjemelles will be preadaminant" (FW 617.23-24), both preceding and predominating over males. But from the start, this feminization is made unstable. "In the name of Annah" brings to mind the Lord's Prayer?"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost"?and also the generic "in the name of" the law or other code. Joyce's text is, in fact, subversively trivializing all idols, the Islamic Allah, the God of Christianity, and every symbolic order. Annah emerges as a common woman with a petty vestimentary con cern; "unhemmed" (=unhymned), along the way, eliminates any hymns that may glorify a Madonna, as well as any boundaries that may confine the flow of the river Liffey Next is listed Annah's "mamafesta memorialising the Most-high est" (FW 104.04). "Memorialize" refers to the Islamic practice of mem orizing the Koran ("Koran many words to memory"?JJA 31.294). It also suggests erecting a memorial to someone or something defunct. Joyce has refined Allah out of existence, and he installs in His place a character from his book, Annah, his own creation. The linearity of authorship is thus disrupted. "Creator he has cre ated for his creatured ones a creation" (FW 29.14-15); Joyce created Annah, who dictated to the prophet writer a work in which he creat ed Anna. This opens up a site for the reciprocal conflagration of two 415</page><page sequence="16">voices, those, on one hand, of Annah the originator and Joyce the amanuensis and those, on the other, of Joyce the author and Anna his creation. The ensuing authorial conflict, carrying overtones of inces tuous intercourse, is laden with violence, evident in the "offspring" of Anna(h) and her male consorts, in effect, both the text itself and the characters of the book, particularly the pervasive twins, as Girard puts it (57). Joyce will attempt to silence Annah and make her, like a proper Mohammedan, surrender to His word. "God created a Pen": The Tool of the Writer Historically, the triumph of Mohammed is, in large part, the tri umph of his speech. The rapid expansion of Islam in the decades that followed his death, driven by the adherence to the principles enunci ated in the Koran, was a Holy War (a "Jehad"?JJA 36.13) to affirm the supremacy of the new faith and spread its word. In the Wake, Islamic imagery is used to portray HCE as a charging warrior. Renamed "Abdullah" (the servant of Allah), he is "a commender of the fright ful," dropping heads and dropping his head in prayer ("tropped head"), turning to the "kabbakks alicubi on the old house for the chargehard" (FW 34.02-03, 05-06, 06, 08-09). Abdullah was the assumed name of Sir Richard Burton, who visited the Holy Land and was able to pray at the Kaaba. The same Wake passage includes " [t]ruth, beard on prophet" (FW33.32-33) and "he who denays it, may his hairs be rubbed in dirt" (FW43.30-31), variations on "by the beard of the prophet" and "may his head be rubbed in dirt," two common Islamic imprecations. HCE is the hope of the "ottomanic faith converters" (FW263.10-11), a reference to the Ottoman Turks who took over Islamic conquests in the Middle Ages. To convey brutality, the title "Allah the Most Merciful" is associated with Mars, the Greek god of war, to become "the Most Marsiful" (FW 353.02). Islam is, in the Wake, a muzzling religion (see "muzzlenimiissilehims" and "muzzling Moselems"? FW5.16, 319.11). In the tradition of Islam, the word is a weapon. Islamic warriors in battle often carried banners on which were written Koranic verses. Joyce notes that "God first created a pen" (JJA 36.208), a quotation from the hadith of al-Malati, as Jeffery points out (151), and from oth ers. The word, spoken or written, is the weapon of the Moslem invad er and is used by Joyce as a symbol of phallic aggression: " (would that fane be Saint Muezzin's calling?holy places!?and this fez brim less as brow of faithful toucher of the ground, did wish it were? blessed be the bones!?the ghazi, power of his sword.) his manslay er's gunwielder protended towards that overgrown leadpencil which 416</page><page sequence="17">was soon, monumentally at least, to rise" (FW56.08-13). The muezzin (now a saint and a part of the Christian iconography) calls at the same time for prayer and for the Islamic Holy War. A "ghazi" or raider (JJA 29.323), he conveys the power of his s/word by carrying a gigantic "leadpencil," possibly Wellington's monument momentarily in erection. The pen is also Joyce's weapon, since the Notebooks describe a "leadpencil with view of Dublin" (JJA 31.270). The association of sexual aggression and writing is evident else where in the Wake: Tristam is coming "to wielderfight his penisolate war" (FW 3.06). In this sentence, we find the pen and the penis but also and importantly the war; likewise, the four elders stand around the bed "sharping up their penisills" (FW 566.09). Joyce's very act of writing, born of his association with Annah, is rooted in violence. There is the violence in the text, specifically nar rated by the text as verbal or physical abuse, military battles, or the emergence of antagonistic pairs of twins. In addition, there is the vio lence of the text. The Wake mentions the "virgin page," the "defence less paper," and the "blooding paper" (FW513.27, 189.09, 101.20) that Joyce is trying to pierce by stabs and gashes akin to those left by the four-pronged fork of the professor at the breakfast table. The paper wounds that he inflicts are taken to mean "stop, please stop, do please stop, and O do please stop" (FW 124.04-05), and elsewhere they become "[s]top. Press stop. To press stop. All to press stop" (FW 379.05-06), the paper begging for the violence of the writing to halt.18 The Material of the Writer Joyce has no need for a male deity. To conceive his work, fertile intercourse needs the feminine: "My unchanging Word is sacred. The word is my Wife, to exponse and expound, to vend and to velnerate . . . ! Till Breath us depart" (FW 167.28-31). The writer even dwells inside the female body: the "youthrib city," the city Yathrib where Mohammed fled in exile, is renamed "Annapolis" or city of Anna in the Wake (FW318.24?see Figure 2). But "youthrib" is also a woman, born like Eve of a (male) rib. The writer has gone into exile within his own creation.19 Therein he finds the source of his writing material. In a passage that starts with the bismillah and includes references to the Islamic Judgment Day, we find the following confession: "There is among others pleasons whom I love and which are favourests to mind, one which I have pushed my linker in for the movement and, but for my sealring is none to hand I swear, she is highly catatheristic and . . . deeply sangnificant" (FW 357.10-15). "Sealring" evokes Mohammed 417</page><page sequence="18">as the "seal of the Prophets" or the last one to be (Koran 33:40). The passage also quotes the Koranic retelling of the encounter of Suleiman (Solomon) with the Queen of Sheba, named Balkis in Islam: "I found a woman reigning over them, and she has been favoured with every thing; and she has a throne that is magnificent" (Koran 27:23). Suleiman, in the Islamic tradition, is a Jinn with great powers, by virtue of a "sealring" he owns that has engraved on it "the most great name" of God. In the Koranic version, the Queen discards her lover and converts to Islam after receiving a letter from him carrying the bismillah (Koran 27.22-44). The incident is noted in JJA 31.294 by "mussilma/Balkis, reine de Saba/Q. of Shebeen" (see Figure 8). In the Wakean version, the narrator extracts from the woman's body the excrement ("catatheristic") and blood ("sangnificant") to mix in with the "indelible ink" (his own excrement) that the artist and "eminent writer" produces in FW 185.14-26. I mentioned earlier that the isnad of the Wake traces its own sources back to fecal material. Rather than sacrilege, this gesture places the Wake at the opposite extreme from Islam. Islam insists on the radical discontinuity between every being and God, stressing that there is no analogy, no connection between the two orders separating the creator and his creations ("our eternal different from His"?JJA 36.210). If the Koran is issued from God and written in His language, the Wake, in contrast, is as "man-made" as one can get.20 The Islamic profession of faith, "There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his Prophet," becomes "for ann there is but one liv and hir newbridge is her old" (FW63.13-14), where an attempt is made to be Annah's only lover ("liv" = love, and "newbridge" = bridegroom). But this arrangement is unstable. The gesture of reaching for the object of desire invariably results in mimetic rivalry, a major problem for the intercourse. The relationship, now triangulated, becomes a site of double bind, including a concern with virginity and fidelity (both major elements in Joyce's personal life and in Finnegans Wake). In the "Mime" chapter, Isa is described as "twilled [with] a twine of flame to let the laitiest know she's marrid" (FW232.14-15). The "marrid" is an Islamic demon of the very highest order, and marriage imbues Isa with malefic qualities. The same double bind links Annah to Joyce, as it shaped Joyce's relation with Nora. Intercourse is, at the same time, a fruitful act and the source of malefic consequences. It brings numer ous gifts from Anna's bag (FW 210.06-212.19), many of which are threatening?including one for "Shem, her penmight" (FW 212.18). Another problem with this intercourse is the close link between sexuality and violence. I mentioned the identification of pen and penis. One of the letters of the Wake tells of "an old story, the tale of a Treestone with one Ysold, of a Mons held by tentpegs" (FW 113.18 418</page><page sequence="19">19). In Islamic cosmology, the mountains are akin to tents with pegs or veins holding them to the ground (Koran 78:07); to cause an earth quake, Allah needs only to command the mountain to tug on its vein. "Mons" is the female pubic mound and the sexual content of the Wake ("delta = pubic D"?JJA 29.34), and, if we highlight "held," the tale is one of repression. "Mother of the Book"' The Purloined Female Author Since a male writer has taken over the writing, the erect leadpencil mentioned earlier is preventing a shattered female voice ("voi") from being heard. We perceive only fragments of her speech as short mono syllables: "He hear her voi of day gon by. He hears! Zay, zay, zay! But, by the beer of his profit, he cannot answer" (FW68.26-28). In this pas sage, we find the Islamic expression "by the beard of the prophet" replaced by "the beer of his profit" conveying the idea that the male who is taking advantage of the situation ("profit") may have had too much "beer" to drink. "Beer" in Arabic also means a well, and the "beer of the prophet" is the holy spring of Zemzem, next to which Hagar is lamenting. The passage continues: "If violence to life, limb and chattels, often as not, has been the expression, direct or through an agent male, of womanhid offended" (FW68.36-69.02). The menac ing attitude of the "agent male" offends the woman and makes her hide. The female silenced may be the deity: "She has a gift of seek on site and she allcasually ansars helpers, the dreamydeary Heed! Heed! It may half been a missfired brick, as some say, or it mought have been due to a collupsus of his back promises, as others looked at it. (There extand by now one thousand and one stories, all told, of the same)" (FW5.24-29). Joyce equates the camel with God ("God-camel-Arab"? JJA 29.108) and Allah ("allahthallacamellated"? FW 285.21); the dreamydeary is a lovable female deity dreaming and providing help. "Heed! Heed!" means in Arabic "Feast, Feast" (the date of some Islamic holidays are announced as the moon is sighted) and also to lend an ear. The story is but a variation on the tales narrated in The Thousand and One Nights by Scheherazade to her sister Duniazade, as she tries to delay her own death at the hand of her husband Shahrayar. The only string of Arabic words in the Waice abusively addresses the camel?"utskut, urqurd, jamal, qum, yallah" (FW 233.32), which translates as "shut up, run, camel, get up, come on." Mohammed is the last in a series of male prophets that includes Noah, Moses, Abraham (with his two sons Isaac and Ismael), and Jesus (Koran 6:82-89). With Mohammed, the Seal of the Prophets (Koran 33:40), revelation ends, and the Koran is its final perfect word, 419</page><page sequence="20">abrogating previous revelations. But tradition holds that the Koran is only a copy of a precursor archetypal text, called the "Book of Books" or the "Mother of the Book," preserved in heaven under the throne of Allah (Koran 13:39 and 43:4). The Judaic Torah and the Christian Injil are also copies from this celestial original but have been tampered with by their respective peoples. Joyce introduces a female prophet as "the mother of the book," but she disappears "from the sourface of this earth" (FW50.11 12, 10). If 622 is the year of Islam, Anna's year is 1132, when her twin boys are born. Curiously, the book that she dictates has been purloined by the copyist that same year: "Somewhere, parently, in the ginnandgo gap between antedeluvious and annadominant the copyist must have fled with his scroll" (FW 14.16-18). HCE/Joyce has appropriated the "mother of the book," the scroll as well as The Thousand and One Nights,21 and taken over the writing. The remote possibility of the existence of female authors is derided: "Heave we aside the fallacy, as punical as finikin, that it was not the king kingself but his inseparable sisters, uncontrollable nighttalkers, Skertsiraizde with Donyahzade, who afterwards . . . came down into the world as amusers" (FW32.06-10). The only signature we now find is that of a male writer: "The great fact emerges that after that historic date all holographs so far exhumed initialled by Haromphrey bear the sigla H.C.E." (FW32.12-14). "Aslim-All-Muslim": The Surrender of Annah Joyce the writer tries to make Annah surrender in the tradition of Islam. Displaced from her position as the primal progenitor, she is turned into an Irish houri: "Houri of the coast of emerald, arrah of the lacessive poghue, Aslim-All-Muslim, the resigned to her surrender" (FW68.11-13). "Aslim" is, in Arabic, the imperative for "surrender!" But, resisting surrender, she provokes (lacesso in Latin) and then chal lenges a dog: "sfidare him, tease fido, eh tease fido, eh eh tease fido, toos topples topple, stop, dug of a dog of a dgiaour, ye!" (FW 68.17 18). In Italian, "sfidare" means "to challenge" and "ti sfido" "I chal lenge you," according to Roland McHugh.22 In Islam, Jeffery writes, Satan is akin to a dog "whom Allah let loose against you, and when you busily occupy yourself making war on him, you grow tired then he gets the better of you, bites bits from you, and wounds you sorely, so you turn to the Lord of the dog, that he may drive him off from you" (117). The "dog" is an unbeliever, "giaour" meaning an infidel, a non-Moslem that Anna is toying with. 420</page><page sequence="21">Annah, under the name of "Langley" is also the "mother of the book with a dustwhisk tabularasing his obliteration done upon her involucrum" (FW50.12-13). "Langley" can be read as "l'Anglais," the English language that Joyce is distorting and undermining. She is resisting her author, dusting the place (elsewhere, we see her wash ing) to undo ("tabula rasa") the erasure that he has inflicted on her. This parallels a Notebook entry: "Language destroyed every night &amp; built up next day. Delight at 1st light &amp; rational words" (JJA 34.140). "Involucrum" means a sheath or an envelope and reiterates the tam pering with language. The Islamic injunction to surrender elsewhere becomes "[a]bedicate yourself" (FW 379.19), an injunction to adopt his speech and alphabet. But the male and the female have become consubstantial in a way, Annah having been taught by a Koran that will not let her go free: "His cheekmole of allaph foriverever her allinall and his Kuran never teachit her the be the owner of thyself" (FW 242.31-32). In Joyce's Notebooks, "Cheekmole" is "a city,"23 and "be the owner of thyself" is equated with "divorce" (JJA 37.12). What this may be saying is that he dwells in the city of "allaph," an Arabic-sounding rendering of ALP, where the river runs for ever ("foriverever"). But his word ("aleph") is forever in her. Annah is not allowed to divorce, and the alliance is indissoluble. Her voice will be heard alone in the last few pages of the Wake. In Joyce's notes, the Koran has a "delta at [the] end" (JJA 31.294? Figure 8), and the book that starts with "[i]n the Name of Annah" is intended to be the "Book of Living" (JJA 36.300), bringing forth life, in stark contrast to the Egyptian Book of the Dead. The Women Outside Islam: Al-Lat, Eve, and Hagar Many women have been left at the margins of Islamic sacred texts. I mentioned earlier the pre-Islamic goddesses, Al-Lat, Manat, and Al Uzza, topics of the Satanic verses. Two other important figures are Eve and Hagar. In the Islamic tradition, the fall of Adam may not involve a female or a sexual sin. According to the words of the historian Th'alibi, whom Peters quotes, "When Adam was brought down to earth, his feet were on the earth but his head was in heaven. The angels came to fear him and they complained about that to God, and he diminished his size to sixty cubits, the length of a forearm" (11). Bygmester Finnegan, appearing for the first time as HCE, is "Haroun Childeruc Eggeberth" (FW 4.32), an avatar of Haroun al-Rashid, the famous caliph who roams through the Thousand and One Nights. He is described as a gigantic skyscraper reaching high peaks ("celescalating 421</page><page sequence="22">the himals"?FW 5.01) before he is knocked down to the ground. As in Islam, this retelling of Genesis in the Wake ("Eggeberth" is the birth from an egg) fails to mention Eve. Lines 5.13-29 describe the original fall ("municipal sin"), the origin of the Kaaba, and the times of Islamic prayer and begin as follows: "What then agentlike brought about that tragoady thundersday this municipal sin business? Our cubehouse still rocks as earwitness to the thunder of his arafatas. " ALP is intro duced only at this point after the fall: "She has a gift of seek on site and she allcasually ansars helpers, the dreamydeary." The female camel divinity is answering and helping Adam ("ansars helpers"), rather than pushing him down. In the last chapter as well, ALP coaches her husband to rise and "stand up tall!" (FW620.01). Another important woman at the root of Islam, Hagar, is left out of the Koran as well. The origin of the Kaaba in Islamic tradition is linked with the Judaic story of Abraham and his two consorts, again a story of mimetic rivalry and violence. Thinking that she is barren, Sarah allows Abraham to "go into" Hagar, his Arabian slave, and Hagar conceives Ismael (Gen. 16:15). Later, Sarah becomes pregnant with Isaac. On two occasions, when it is known that Hagar is to have a child and when she sees their two sons playing together, Sarah becomes angry and asks for Hagar and Ismael to be cast out. In the Biblical text, Hagar sits in despair until God and his angels hear her sobbing and make a spring appear that will allow them to survive (Gen. 21:09-20). In the Islamic version, Abraham himself leads Hagar and Ismael away, and together father and son build the Kaaba (Koran 2:125-27). Nearby appeared the sacred well of Zemzem, mentioned in the Wake as a "mamafesta" title: "By the Stream of Zemzem under Zigzag Hill" (FW 105.04, 07-08). The sacrifice of a woman and the appearance of a flowing body of water are what resolves the mimetic rivalry. Annah's Offspring: Israel and Ismael Like Islam, Annah has her own calendar, which starts in A D. 1132 when her twin sons are born: "These sons called themselves Caddy and Primas" (FW 14.12), meaning cadet (second-born) and primas (first-born). The twins, bivitelline, Siamese or superfetated, Abel and Cain, Jacob and Esau, Shem and Shaun, the raven and the dove, the p/q split, pervade the Waice. Their proliferation is a sign of the loss of differences that maintain order, a symptom of undifferentiated sym metrical violence as they meet "face a facing" and "are set, force to force" (FW 223.15).24 Ismael, first-born son of Abraham and circum cised like Isaac, is considered to be the father of the Islamic commu nity. God bestows his blessing on him, not on Isaac/Israel. Joyce restores him to his first-born position in the "Mime" episode, where 422</page><page sequence="23">he appears, testifying to the Mohammedan unity of God?"I hear, O Ismael, how they laud is only as my loud is one"?and receiving the patriarchal benediction?"my excellency is over Ismael" (FW 258.13, 16). The parental violence, issuing from Joyce/HCE against Annah, threatens to spread to their children. The boys in Chapter III.2 give Issy rules and regulations. A life-threatening menace is closing in on her, as suggested by Shaun, who says, "Open the door softly, some body wants you, dear! You'll hear him calling you, bump, like a blizz, in the muezzin of the turkest night. Come on now, pillarbox!" (FW 442.31-33). In Joyce's Notebooks, the muezzin is an announcer of death (JJA 29.04), and the phrase "like a blizz" may be read as "like Iblis," the Islamic demon. Shaun goes on: "We are all eyes. I have his quo ram of images all on my retinue, Mohomadhawn Mike" (FW 443.01 02). His abusive injunctions continue with "I'll be all over you myselx horizontally . . . I'll smack your fruitflavoured jujube lips well for you" and end with threats of spanking that will make Issy yell "papa pardon," daddy forgive me (FW444.18-23, 445.17). Is Shaun just imagining the scene, or is he replaying something he has witnessed? When the adult couple in the Wake is described in their bedroom, the woman is "sitting, look[ing] at [the] ceiling," and "exhibit[ing] fear" (FW 559.26, 27-28). Her buttocks bear "black and blue marks" caused by "beltings" or whipping with a belt (FW564.23, 25). Paternal violence against Issy may have already occurred. After all, she got those "pothooks" (buttocks) from the father (FW 280.16). On a larger scale, as Girard notes, twinning provides the cyclothy mic structure of the Wakean text, the mimetic symmetrical rivalry of acts of building and destruction (154). We have, on one hand, the tower of Babel, the scaffold of the master builder, the house that Jack built, and the leitmotiv "up guards and at them," constantly coun tered, on the other hand, by their undoing: the fall of Humpty Dumpty the collapse of Edenborough, and the leitmotiv "his counte nance fell." The death and awakening of Finnegan are only one of the manifestations of mimetic rivalry and violence. Islam and Salam: Surrender and Peace Trapped in escalating violence, "[o]ne dreams," says Girard, "of a radically other violence, a truly decisive and permanent violence, a violence that would put an end to all violence" (101). He continues, saying that the time is ripe for the sacrificial crisis, a sudden unanimi ty calling for an emissary victim (101). The victim will attract malefic and contagious violence, and its own expulsion or death will restore the cultural order, founded on asymmetry and differentiation, where 423</page><page sequence="24">order and security can prevail. The text of the Wake contains numer ous aborted attempts at such scapegoating: the cat who will not go away, the unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable, the traveler for Philadelphia who will be leaving in the morning, the man from St. I ves going the opposite way, and, of course, Finnegan who keeps coming back. Finnegan is clearly Moslem. In one episode, he is attended by "Agog and magog," the two giants of the Islamic demonology whose coming will herald the judgment day (FW 6.19). In another, "with still a life or two to spare," he rises to his feet and speaks "of the One and [tells] of the Compassionate" (FW 52.07-08, 12-13). But the crisis will end, in a definite fashion, only with the departure of a female, Anna, as she takes over the writing. Anna has concerns other than violence. Issy recalls her "moth ersmothered model," who changes her outfit and her religion ("spir itual toilettes") five times a day "for sunset wear and nightfallen use and daybroken donning and nooncheon showing and the very thing for teasetime" (FW 191.25, 26, 26-28), duplicating and erotically femi nizing the schedule of the Islamic ritual prayer. Anna addresses HCE as follows: "I seen the likes in the twinngling of an aye. . . . The sehm asnuh [anagrams of Shem and Shaun]. Two bredder as doffered as nors in soun. When one of him sighs or one of him cries 'tis you all over. No peace at all" (FW620.14-18). Anna clear ly sees the mimetic rivalry and understands that the boys are grow ing up to be like their father. But rather than partake in the violence or surrender to the "agent male" (FW 69.01), she will voluntarily leave. Her exit will bring back asymmetry, will define black and white, and will take place at the crack of dawn, when the two threads are distinguishable. "All men has done something. . . . We'll lave it" (FW 621.32-33). In French, "lave" means to wash, a task also per formed by the washerwomen. The Kaaba?blackened by the sin of men (sin of violence)?will regain its original white color. Anna's exit is at the same time an exodus?a quest and a becoming. Like Hagar's leaving, which brings peace to the household of Abraham, Anna's "exitus" (JJA 35.249) dissipates the mimetic vio lence. She departs the male "house of laws" (FW623.11). That Anna's move is Islamic is suggested by her parody, in FW 623.11-13, of the expression attributed to Mohammed: "If the mountain does not come to me, I will go to the mountain." Because she is the one who restores order, she acquires beneficent qualities that establish her as sacred. By the same token, the Wake as a myth is desacralized. Yet she is leaving to join her "mad father" (FW628.01-02), the maj nun writer of Finnegans Wake, so that the end will be a beginning and the writing can be perennially resumed. 424</page><page sequence="25">Joyce's Personal "Hegira" Joyce infused his private life with various Islamic touches, some humorous, others deeper reaching, that we can glimpse in his letters. He referred to his female entourage as "the harem" (LettersI 358), and he suspected that a cat who deserted his apartment had "become a mohammadan" and gone into exile (LettersI 363). Expecting many visitors, he wrote that "a great number of mountains are seeking out the prophet lately" (LettersI 240). His attempt at "circling the square" (FW 186.12 and LettersI 251) may evoke circumambulating the square-shaped Kaaba (Figure 6). The square is, after all, the siglum that Joyce used when referring to his Work in Progress. Yet in the Notebooks, he equates the Kaaba with the Irish blarneystone, a rock that makes those who kiss it proficient in smooth talk (JJA 29.261). He referred to his frequent address changes as "hegiras" (LettersIII 217). The central role that exodus plays in Islam may have attracted Joyce's interest, for the hadith of as-Suyuti, as quoted in Jeffery, says, "The Moslem is a stranger and will always be a stranger, and blessed those who recognize themselves in this fate of stranger" (22). Appalled by violence in real life, Joyce retreated into his writing. He was well aware of the peacefulness that one can find in Islam. In a letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver, he relates his strange dream of a Turk seated in a bazaar calmly weaving away a colorful carpet and inter prets the dream as "evidently [a metaphor for the] split rainbow and also Parts I and III" of Finnegans Wake: he then adds with unexpected humility (countered by punning on the name of Allah): "may Allah who is infallahble guide this epistle of his lowliest and shed upon his sconce the quietude of the carpetweaver" (LettersI 261). Endorsing and opposing Islam, Joyce incorporates it into his "cyclewheeling" construct (FW 186.02), where "Unity is Plurability," the sacred is secular, genesis and doomsday are simultaneous and share the same locus, and God and his creations are interchangeable. In contrast to Islam's Koran, Joyce's has no didactic or eschatological message: "The letter is meditated, but neither sent nor received" (JJA 35.265). Issued by liquor from a battlefield over language, the main purpose of the "alcohoran" is its own intoxicated writing. This we may comprehend best if we are "abcedminded" or else "absinthe minded" (FW 18.17, 464.17). The Surrender (Islam) of Annah?originator, consort, and proge ny?is to Joyce's language that is also hers; only in the erotics of its endless flow can the Writer, a permanent exile, truly find peace or salam. 425</page><page sequence="26">NOTES I would like to thank Shelly and Barbara Brivic for their invaluable friend ship, encouragement, and help. I wish to affirm that I do not endorse Joyce's views on Islam and that my purpose in examining them is purely academic.

Joyce seems to have used the same convention in his notebooks One of ALP's names in Finnegans Wake is "Alannah," a contraction of Allah and Anna (FW 377.19-20). 8 The contemporary French thinker Ren? Girard has offered a model that explains the origin of myths in religious and literary texts. Girard discusses generally the concept of mimesis (imitation) in Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World, trans. Stephen Bann and Michael Metteer (Stanford: Stanford Univ Press, 1987), pp. 283-98, and in his Violence and the Sacred, trans. Patrick Gregory (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1977), pp. 143-96, proposes that mimesis is the mechanism by which desire (mimetic desire for a same object) is aroused, leading to mimetic rivalry (see especially p. 169). The relationship between the rivals thus posited constitutes a double bind (the desire to be alike and unlike at the same time) that leads to a loss of dif ferentiation, manifesting in the emergence of doubles including twins This loss culminates in a presacrificial chaotic order where differences are obliter ated and where violence escalates to an unbearable level. It is resolved, he postulates in Violence, by a sacrificial crisis, the scapegoating of a victim that will restore order and hence will come to be regarded as sacred (pp. 39-67). Girard discusses scapegoating further in Violence (p. 101) and generally in The Scapegoat, trans. Yvonne Freccero (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1986). Further references to Violence and the Sacred will be cited parenthetical ly in the text. 9 "Have you considered Al-Lat and Al-Uzza and Manat the other, the third? These are exalted females, and verily their intercession is to be hoped for." The first verse was left in and became 53:19-20 in the Koran; the two oth ers were censored out and became (as justified in Koran 22:52-53) the infa mous "Satanic Verses" that cost Salman Rushdie his freedom. The females were later acknowledged by Islam as being Allah's servants, not his associ ates or daughters?see Peters (p. 177). 10 Arabian women, both in medieval times and nowadays, favor male off spring over female, and a reported custom among nomadic tribes was the burying alive of female newborns. Al-Khalassa means salvation or deliver ance and is a name given to the Kaaba. Joyce mentions, as noted in Lane Poole, "El Khalasa, W hoping for males" and "infanticide of female infant" (JJA 36.198, 203?13). ALP seems to have reluctantly accepted the birth of her daughter, as she tells her husband in her final soliloquy: "And blowing off to me, hugly Judsys, what wouldn't you give to have a girl! Your wish was mewill" (FW620.26-27). "Your wish is my will" is the customary answer of submissive Islamic Jinns to humans. 11 The following passage is found in the hadith "The Prophet hath cursed ten persons on account of wine: one, the first extractor of the juice of the grape for others; the second for himself; the third the drinker of it; the fourth the bearer of it; the fifth the person to whom it is brought; the sixth the waiter; the seventh the seller of it; the eighth the eater of its price; the ninth the buyer of it; the tenth that person who hath purchased it for another"-see Lane-Poole (p. 157). Joyce noted "very thorough" when reading this (JJA 36.207). 12 While the dreamer of the Wake is asleep, the eye or "I" of Joyce is at all times alert. In addition to the color of the "skibluh eyes," the blue of Joyce's eyes comes in a lapis lazuli shade?"in the lazily eye of his lapis" (FW293.11) 427</page><page sequence="28">We also encounter Joyce's dark eyeshades described as "semicoloured stainedglasses" and his eye patch as covering a "blackguarded eye" (FW 463.14, 464.12). He contemplates himself "wiz my naked I" and says, "We are all eyes" (FW 357.33, 443.01). One of the characteristics of Allah is that "nei ther does somnolence affect him nor sleep" (Koran 2:255). Finnegans Wake's "ideal reader suffering from an ideal insomnia" (FW 120.13-14) may be God turned reader or reader turned God. 13 Jeffery lists the ninety-nine names of Allah, most of which are epithets derived from the Koran that all stress His transcendence (pp. 93-95). 14 Mohammed was famous for his smile. The hadith mentions a comment of Abdallah B. al-Harith?"Never did I see anyone who smiled more than the Apostle of Allah"?as quoted in Jeffery (p. 32). 15 This mission seems to have been endorsed by the readership of the Wake. Quotations from it are indicated, as in a sacred book, by an abbreviated title, followed by a page and line number. Critics have undertaken an "exegesis" of Joyce's work, a term usually reserved for the analysis of Scriptures. Islamic leaders do not endorse "translations" of the Koran into foreign languages but only "interpretations." At the sessions of International Joyce Symposia on translating Joyce's work, I often get the impression that the same is true of Finnegans Wake. 16 The number of Annah's suras, 111, recurs in FW 38.13 ("among a hun dred and eleven others in her usual curtsey"), 220.21 ("hendrud aloven entrees"), 325.04-05 ("Anna Lynchya Pourable! One and eleven"), 425.32 (a hundred and eleven other things"), and 617.03 ("a hundred and eleven ploose"). The number possibly refers to her three children "wan bywan bywan" (one by one by one) or "[o]ne and eleven" (one and twins); JJA 34.175, in effect, mentions "111 children." 17 Although I find no evidence in the Notebooks that Joyce knew this Arabic word, he uses the same imagery elsewhere in the Wake, referring to "the brideen Alannah ... lost in her diamindwaiting" and to the "diamondskulled granddaucher, Adamantaya Liubokovskva" (FW377.19-20, 498.14-15). 18 Manifestations of mimetic violence in the Wake also include the rivalry of words: humpty dumpty doublets, sometimes escalating into word ladders, stuttering, palindromes, and lists of a same word in diverse languages. The most powerful manifestation is the conflagration of opposite words to cancel out the meaning and "abnihilisat[e] ... the etym" (353.22): where are you when "purely [on the] doffensive" (78.30); can you trust your "boy fiend" (224.24); what if you "long to betrue" him (459.20)? One confronts "sacreligion" (365.03-04) and a "retempter" (154.06), deals with an "ethical fict" (523.33), encounters objects that are "moistly dry" (502.19) and "forebitten fruit" (303.16-17), and wonders "[w]as liffe worth leaving?" (230.25). It is "the beginning of all thisorder" (540.19). The text of the Wake is the verbal equiva lent of the presacrificial chaotic order that Girard defines as based on sym metry and undifferentiation. 19 In Girard 's model, in Things Hidden, when the symmetry of the rivals becomes unbearable, one may try to create a difference by turning the model into an "anti-model" and no longer believing in its transcendence (p. 300). 20 Elsewhere, Joyce says "I dehlivered them with freakandesias by the con 428</page><page sequence="29">stant droppings from my smalls instalmonths/' (FW 542.31-32), the drop pings from his small intestines being freaky sweetmeats (in French, friandis es). 21 The Notebooks have the following entry: "JJ's book ever a new sense/1001 nights"?JJA 34.04. 22 Roland McHugh, Annotations to "Finnegans Wake," rev. ed. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1991), p. 68. 23 The Arabs admired beauty spots to a seemingly extravagant degree. The Anacreon of Persia affected to prize the mole upon the cheek of his beloved above the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara, according to Lane (p. 214). 24 Joyce indeed intended the twinning to imply conflict (JJII 707), as in "[k]nock knock. War's where! Which war? The Twwinns" (FW 330.30). Figure 1.
