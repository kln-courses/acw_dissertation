<plain_text><page sequence="1">NIETZSCHEAN EXPLORATIONS III. NIETZSCHE'S REREADING OF PLATO CA THERINE ZUCKER T Carleton College z HILOSOPHY TRADITIONALLY has been understood as the search for truth or wisdom. But, Nietzsche argues as early as The Birth of Tragedy, with Kant that search culminates only in the "knowledge" that we cannot know. How then can we understand this apparently sisyphean endeavor? In attempting to answer this question, Nietzsche reexamines the origins of the Western philosophic tradition in the works of Plato and his peculiar "hero," Socrates. During the course of his life's reflections, Nietzsche comes to suspect that Platonic doctrines, like "the idea of the Good" and the "immortal soul," constitute public teachings that Plato himself did not believe and that, therefore, differ markedly from Plato's own activity or philosophy properly understood. To the extent to which later philosophers built on or extended the Platonic theory of ideas, they built on a falsification, a "noble lie" or mythos, that Plato intentionally fabricated not merely to protect philosophy from political persecution but primarily to give philosophy political influ- ence. If Nietzsche's suspicion is correct, Western philosophy since Plato has proceeded on a misperception of its own origin and essential nature and must, therefore, be radically reinterpreted in light of its political origins and goals. Nietzsche's rereading of Plato is thus important, first, because it raises questions about the adequacy of the traditional understanding of philosophy and its historical development. Nietzsche would lead us to read not only Plato himself but all of Plato's successors in a most untraditional way. Second, Nietzsche's reinterpretation of Platonic philosophy brings the affirmative conclusion of his own reinterpreta- tion of Western philosophy to the fore and makes it more concrete.

As the only form of self-fulfilling human activity, philosophy represents the only possible source of justification for all other forms of human life; and Plato offers perhaps the only example besides Nietzsche himself. Nietzsche's challenge to the traditional understanding of philosophy is both more radical and more positive than his followers realize when they emphasize his critique of otherworldly ideas or "metaphysics."I Nietzsche suggests that there is a life truly worth living-the life of philosophy, properly understood-here and now. Third, Nietzsche's rereading of Plato explicitly raises the question of the proper relation between politics and philosophy, because Nietzsche argues that Plato intentionally hid the true nature of his own activity behind the skeptical, plebian mask of Socrates and his nihilistic metaphysical doctrines in order to have a political effect. Does political philosophy necessarily involve lying, as Nietzsche's critique of Plato suggests?2 Does Nietzsche himself escape the need for public teaching only by giving up all concern for the fate of the many nonphilosophers, by giving up politics altogether?3 Nietzsche does not come to his new reading of Plato immediately. Rather, in The Birth of Tragedy Nietzsche identifies Socrates as the " vortex or turning-point of so-called world history" who corrupted "the typical Hellenic youth," "the divine Plato."4 Socrates destroyed the tragic insight with his demand that everything be intelligible, but he created a new illusion to replace the tragic insight-the illusion that man could not only attain knowledge but also correct his exis- tence with the knowledge he attained. Plato merely followed Socrates in making poetry subservient to philosophy. As the destroyer of tragedy, Socrates appears to represent an essentially negative, critical, and destructive force. Claiming to have no knowledge himself, he only asks questions; he "was the only one who acknowledged to himself that he knew nothing."' "We are offered a key to the character of Socrates," Nietzsche suggests, "by the wonderful phenomenon known as 'the daimonion of Socrates.'... This voice, whenever it comes, always dissuades";6 it never prompts Socrates to act. Yet Nietzsche observes that the image of Socrates presented in the Platonic writings has a definitely positive, preser- vative rather than negative or destructive effect. For if we imagine that whole incalculable sum of energy used up for this world tendency had been used not in the service of knowledge but forthe practical, i.e.,</page><page sequence="3">Zuckert / REREADING PLATO 215 egoistic aims of individuals and peoples, then we realize that in that case universal wars of annihilation and continual migrations of peoples would probably have weakened the instinctive lust for life to such an extent that suicide would have become a general custom. .. a practical pessimism that [has been] in the world wherever art did not appear in some form-especially as religion and science.7 By initiating the search for knowledge, Socrates gives men a new reason to live. Rather than represent the antithesis of art, it seems upon further examination that Socrates represents a new kind of art. Modern men know that Socrates and the philosophic way of life he represents constitute an illusion, because we have learned from Kant that the search for knowledge culminates only in the knowledge that we cannot know. The source or nature of this illusory search for knowledge is not so clear, however. [Tlhe logical drive that became manifest in Socrates ... displays a natural power such as we encounter to our awed amazement only in the very greatest instinctive forces. Anyone who, through the Platonic writings, has experienced even a breath of the divine naivete and sureness of the Socratic way of life, will also feel how the enormous driving-wheel of logical Socratism is in motion, as it were, behind Socrates, and that it must be viewed through Socrates as through a shadow.8 Socrates himself seems aware of the instinctive or nonconscious character of his activity when he insists on his divine calling. At the end of his life, moreover, Socrates himself appears to suspect that there is something missing in his own activity. "As he tells his friends in prison, there often came to him one and the same dream apparition, which always said the same thing to him: 'Socrates, practice music."' So in prison, Socrates finally composes a prelude to Apollo and turns a few Aesopian fables into verse: "Perhaps-thus he must have asked himself-. . . there is a realm of wisdom from which the logician is exiled? Perhaps art is even a necessary correla- tive of, and supplement for science?"9 Socrates himself thus points toward the need to complete or complement philosophy with art for philosophy to understand its own source and nature. The disjunction between poetry and philosophy so strongly urged in The Republic, Nietzsche suggests, ultimately is false. As Nietzsche writes explicitly of "the Platonic Socrates, and as he calls longingly for the emergence of a " Socrates who practices music,"'a0 it seems curious that Nietzsche does not pay more attention to the author of the new form of art that makes Socrates its dialectical</page><page sequence="4">216 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1985 hero-Plato. If Socrates himself was utterly amusic, Plato admit- tedly was not. Does Plato not represent the fusion of philosophy and poetry that Nietzsche seeks? This question proves more difficult for Nietzsche to answer over his lifetime than would first appear. In The Birth of Tragedy Nietzsche presents Plato merely as Socrates's student. Convinced by Socrates that poetry was irrational, but unable to eradicate his own poetic instincts entirely, Plato sought to avoid the criticism of art he himself levels in The Republic, "that it is the imitation of a phantom and hence belongs to a sphere even lower than the empirical world ... [by] endeavoring to transcend reality and to represent the idea which underlies this pseudo-reality"1'1 Socrates's demand that the world be (made?) intelligible is much more important than Plato's particular attempt to describe or imagine an intelligible world. If philosophers had been satisfied or even really concerned with the works, the claimed "knowledge" or doctrines of their prede- cessors, Nietzsche suggests, Socrates would not have had such a powerful, life-preserving influence, because the philosophers would quickly have discovered the sisyphean character of their endeavor. It is not the disproof of competing visions but the attempt to discover an intelligible order that prompts men to ever-renewed effort; that is, it is the nature of the activity and not the particular results that makes philosophy such an attractive way of life. Plato did not influence later men so much through his "theory of ideas" as through his presen- tation of philosophy as the only satisfying way of life in his portrait of Socrates. In The Birth of Tragedy Nietzsche does not criticize Plato so much for inventing the "other world" of the ideas, therefore, as he does for making poetry merely ancillary to philosophy. The attempt to discover an intelligible order is based on an illusion: the illusion that there is an order to be discovered that exists indepen- dently of man. As an illusion or "myth," the rationalism Socrates represents constitutes an artistic creation. It is not Plato who created the new illusion, however, but Socrates himself. Socrates did not exercise such great historical influence through his explicit teaching or even as a living example of the philosophic way of life, Nietzsche observes, as he did through his death. [T]he image of the dying Socrates as the man whom knowledge and reasons have liberated from the fear of death, is the emblem that, above the entrance gate of science, reminds all of its mission-namely, to make existence appear comprehensible and thus justified; and if reasons do not suffice, [as Nietzsche suggests they do not,] myth has to come to their aid in the end.'2</page><page sequence="5">Zuckert / REREADING PLATO 217 Not Plato, but Socrates is the real historical actor or influence, because Socrates engineered his own death. Being thoroughly enigmatical, unclassifiable, and inexplicable, he might have been asked to leave the city, and posterity would never have been justified in charging the Athenians with an ignominious deed. But that he was sentenced to death, not exile, Socrates himself seems to have brought about with perfect awareness and without any natural awe of death.'3 Deeds are not only more persuasive but also more real than mere words. Socrates's life may be based on an illusion, but his life itself is not illusion. Socrates is the first, not merely to produce a new vision, "image," or "illusion," but to act it out and thus to make it a living reality. As a result, Socrates becomes the "vortex and turning point of so-called world history"; he creates a new form of existence. But Socrates remains a problem for Nietzsche, because the significance of his intentionally seeking his own death is unclear. Did he knowingly create his own myth through deeds rather than speeches? Did he understand the limits of the logos he was wont to celebrate in dialec- tical conversation? Does philosophy involve intentional deception, even self-deception? In his first book Nietzsche thus indicates that there is something veiled or deceptive in the Platonic dialogues and, hence, in the entire philosophic tradition that follows. But Nietzsche has not yet iden- tified either the nature of the deception or the reasons for "myth- making." Nietzsche does not rest satisfied with his initial view of either philosophy or art for long. In an incomplete and therefore unpublished manuscript on Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks, written one year after The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche recognizes that philosophy does not commence with Socrates. Thus, if the decisive break in Western history occurs with Socrates, it cannot be accurately described simply as the emergence of "rationalism" or "science" against the preceding "poetry" of generative chaos. In this unpublished manuscript Nietzsche gives a praising account of "pre-Platonic" philosophy, as he calls it, in which he not only distinguishes philosophy from both poetry and science but also shows how it encompasses and yet is superior to both. In this unpublished manuscript, moreover, Nietzsche identifies the decisive break not with Socrates, but with Plato.</page><page sequence="6">218 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1985 Philosophy begins, Nietzsche recognizes, with Thales's apparently absurd statement that water is the primal origin and womb of all things. In seeking the origin, philosophy resembles the poetry that preceded it; but philosophy expresses its central thought in an entirely different, nonallegorical, nonmythical manner. The difference in expression reflects a substantive difference of fundamental impor- tance, however. To express one's thought in images is to see or to conceive of the world anthropomorphically, through human eyes. In contrast to all the Greeks before him, Thales declared that not man but water was the truth and the core of things. As a scientist and in contrast to the poets, Thales seeks truth without regard to the human consequences, meaning, or implications. "Aristotle rightly says that 'What Thales and Anaxagoras know will be considered universal, astonishing, difficult and divine, but never useful, for their concern was not with the good of humanity.' " Pre-Platonic philosophy is characterized by a "scientific" stance that is essentially amoral. As the search for knowledge, general and undifferentiated, science is completely nonselective. Science needs, therefore, to be directed, regulated, or tamed by philosophy, which seeks knowledge only of the most important things. As what is regarded as important is change- able, however, philosophy must begin "by legislating greatness." Thales did not overcome the limited empirical observations of his time, but the movement from science to philosophy involves much more than mere generalization from particular observations. The scattered empirical observations Thales made did not justify his grand generalization. "What drove him to it was a metaphysical conviction which had its origin in a mystic intuition. We meet it in every philosophy, together with the ever-renewed attempt at a more suitable expression, this proposition that 'all things are one."'"14 Insight into the fundamental unity of all things constitutes the dis- tinctive act of the "creative imagination" of the philosopher who, unlike the poet, seeks not merely to express his or her own vision but to encapsulate reality or "the truth." Although philosophic proposi- tions about the oneness of all things cannot be proved, they represent more than mere "poetic truths." Philosophy properly speaking cannot take its bearings from the interest, concern, or good of a part, like human happiness, because the whole cannot be subordinated to a part without distortion. If all existence is particularistic, however, the truth can be perceived and "incorporated" only in a particular form of existence. The "truth"</page><page sequence="7">Zuckert / REREADING PLATO 219 can never, therefore, be adequately expressed as a doctrine; words (and, hence, concepts) are inadequate. Although pure or pre-Platonic philosophy does not take its bearings from human needs and desires, it does thus have an emphatically human meaning. Comprehending the essential unity of all things, the philosopher rather self-consciously sees him- or herself as the image or expression of the whole. The philosopher does not so much lose him- or herself in contemplating the cosmos, Nietzsche suggests, as he or she finds his or her own distinctive identity as the sum or abbreviation of the whole. Taken in themselves, all philosophic "truths" or doctrines constitute errors; they merely represent one person's vision or experience of his or her own existence. Philosophic doctrines should not, therefore, be studied so much as arguments as they should be celebrated as signs of supreme individuality: "So this has existed-once, at least-and is therefore a possibility, this way of life, this way of looking at the human scene" (Preface). Philosophy can only be understood as a particular way or form of life. It is the form of life that encompasses the whole. This appears to be the reason that Nietzsche emphasizes Socrates rather than Plato in his early writings; Socrates represents philosophy as a way of life much more than a doctrine such as the theory of ideas.'5 In Socrates as in the pre-Socratics, according to Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy, philosophy and science still are combined. Beginning with Plato, however, philosophy loses its unifying ability. Instead of penetrating to the core of existence, Plato attempts to mediate among the several preexisting doctrines and the variety of psychological types that produced these doctrinal differences. All subsequent philosophers are such mixed types.... [Nietzsche charac- terizes himself as such a "mixed type" in his later works.] What is far more important, however, is that the mixed types were founders of sects, and that sectarianism with its institutions and counterinstitutions was opposed to Hellenic culture and its previous unity of style. Although pre-Socratic philosophers had no such intention-Nietzsche observes that they lived very much aloof from their community or people-each served to reinforce the unity of Hellenic culture by giving that unity a new expression or interpretation. "[B]eginning with Plato, [however,] philosophers became exiles, conspiring against their fatherland."''6 Nietzsche does not explain the source of the divi- sion, what we might call the politicization of philosophy, in this</page><page sequence="8">220 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1985 unpublished manuscript. It occurs, he argues in Daybreak, when the philosopher tries not merely to discover an order or the unity of all things but to rule or order other people. Nietzsche's understanding of philosophy is not complete or entirely coherent in this early unpublished manuscript. Although he says that all philosophy, including pre-Platonic philosophy, begins by legis- lating what is important, he does not develop the meaning of this legislation. Nietzsche makes the conjunction of order with rule or legislation (a conjunction suggested by the Greek word arche) explicit in his later teaching of the will to power. Likewise, in his later works he associates philosophy as an ordering and hence a valuing activity preeminently with Plato, because Plato teaches that "the idea of the Good" is the ruling principle of the whole. Insofar as they taught the existence of a cosmic order, Nietzsche later suggests, pre-Socratic philosophers also were moralistic. Plato simply made the conjunc- tion of intelligibility and morality more explicit. Because Nietzsche did not complete his analysis of pre-Platonic philosophy with a new description of Socrates, it is difficult to say definitively why he comes to identify the break with Plato rather than with Socrates here. In the Untimely Considerations he publishes immediately after The Birth of Tragedy Nietzsche does call for a new educational system, in explicit contrast to Plato. The distinctive characteristics of modern humans are products of the scientific search for knowledge that commenced with Socrates, if not with Thales, Nietzsche argues. We have collected so much information about past ages and cultures that we have lost all sense of ourselves. In order to discover ourselves and therein the source of all this scientific endeavor (the quest he initially associated with Socrates), we have to free ourselves from the past and hence from the scientific tradition itself; but we can use science itself to do so! Collecting information about the past may serve to preserve the effects of past efforts; but when ancient pieties become oppressive, collecting information also may serve to destroy the authority of the past by showing the origin of past thoughts and acts in violence and error. "It is always a dangerous process.... [S]ince we happen to be the results of earlier generations, we are also the results of their aberrations, passions and errors, even crimes; it is not possible quite to free oneself from this chain.''17 Nietzsche makes his reasons for studying the tradition, particularly for returning to its origins in Greece, especially clear in "Of the Use and Disadvantage of History for Life."'8 We are products of that</page><page sequence="9">Zuckert / REREADING PLATO 221 tradition; this is the great modern historical insight and "virtue." In order to understand, to discover, or to come to ourselves, we must understand the tradition; but the tradition does not make sense in its own terms. In order to understand ourselves and the tradition, we must therefore free ourselves from past understandings or "pieties." We must, like Plato, be critical of previous thinkers; we are, after all, descendants of the Platonic tradition and we cannot change the fact that we descend from it. But as modern thinkers, we can, indeed, we must be more honest, more "'scientific" than Plato. Plato thought a just and rightly ordered society had to be founded on a "necessary lie.'"9 People must believe that they were shaped for their particular function in society before they were born, that is, by nature. The necessary lie, then, is that social order reflects a natural order. If social order does not rest on a natural order, as Plato's insis- tence on the necessity of lying suggests, if perhaps there is no natural order at all, all actual orders have been based on ignorance, error, deceit, and violence. Nietzsche does not pause here to consider the implications of Plato himself admitting that the just society must be founded on a lie. Rather, Nietzsche devotes himself in his second ''positivistic" period to exposing the errors or ignorance at the base of all previous moral and philosophic doctrines. He wishes to see people form or educate themselves on the basis of the truth. In his middle period Nietzsche thus appears to be more scientific even than Socrates, whereas Plato appears to be more poetic than Nietzsche. Like Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy, Plato appears to have believed that the perpetuation of human life requires illusion or art. "Philosophy severed itself from science," Nietzsche states in Human-all-too-Human, when it posed the question, ""what is the knowledge of the world through which mankind may be made happiest? This happened when the Socratic school arose."20 Nietzsche's obser- vation of the severing of philosophy from science appears to be critical of the Socratic school, because it suggests that with Plato, if not with Socrates, philosophy becomes less honest and hence less rigorous as it becomes more "moral." If the truth must be embodied, however, philosophy does not simply decline when it acquires a more explicitly human focus. Rather, it may become more self-conscious. Philosophy does become more deceptive, if also perhaps more interesting, Nietzsche suggests, when it becomes explicitly moralistic. When philosophers seek knowledge of the conditions of human happiness rather than knowledge simply and in general, they may</page><page sequence="10">222 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1985 well conclude that deception or illusion is a condition of human happiness, as Nietzsche himself urged in his earlier analysis of art. Plato concluded as much. If it is merely a necessary lie that social order rests upon nature, however, philosophers have deceived others, if not themselves, when they have presented themselves simply as "scientists" seeking knowledge of the natural order who justify their vocation by observing that such knowledge is useful. Useful for what and to whom, Nietzsche asks. In fact, Nietzsche concludes in his preface to Daybreak, philos- ophers have never found the truth because that is not really what they have been seeking. Why is it that from Plato onwards every philosophical architect in Europe has built in vain? That everything they themselves in all sober seriousness regarded asAerePerennius is threatening to collapse or already lies in ruins? How false is the answer . . . 'because they had all neglected the presupposition for such an undertaking, the testing of the foundations, a critique of reason as a whole.' . . . The correct answer would rather have been that all philosophers were building under the seduction of morality, even Kant-that they were apparently aiming at certainty, at 'truth,' but in reality at 'Majestic Moral Structures."'2 It does not suffice to establish the possibility of knowledge through an examination of the operation of the human mind. One must ask, why seek knowledge at all? That question points, of course, to an answer beyond knowledge itself. Science, or knowledge, has no inherent value or existence apart from human beings. Nietzsche argues in both his early and his late writings that "mind" does not exist apart from or independent of body and, hence, cannot be understood as an indepen- dent entity. Nietzsche thus gives a revised account of the origin of knowledge or the historical development of philosophy and science in The Gay Science.22 People acquired their first concepts or ideas, Nietzsche explains, through an error of their senses that suggested "that there are enduring things, that there are equal things, that there are things, substances, and bodies, that a thing is what it appears, that our will is free, that what is good for me is also good absolutely." These errors were formulated and perpetuated because they proved useful to people; they helped preserve the species. "It was only very late that the deniers and doubters of such propositions came forward." Because our senses lead us to err, doubting the evidence of the senses constitutes an important intellectual advance. Because knowl-</page><page sequence="11">Zuckert / REREADING PLATO 223 edge always presupposes life, however, knowledge can never be had or affirmed in complete abstraction from the requirements of life. The exceptional thinkers like the Eleatics, who ... advanced and maintained the antitheses ofthe natural errors, believedthat it was possible also to live these counterparts: it was they who devised the sage as the man of immutability, impersonality and universality of intuition. . . . [T]hey were of the belief that their knowledge was at the same time the principle of life. Not Plato but the Eleatics first posited the world of eternal, unchanging, perfectly intelligible "being." It is they who first attempt to escape the unsatisfying, never entirely intelligible flux of the sensual world, the here and now, into the world of pure intelligibility. But to do so, they had to deceive themselves. To be able to affirm all this . . . they had to deceive themselves concerning their own condition; they had to attribute to themselves impersonality and unchanging permanence, they had to mistake the nature of the philosophic individual, deny the force of the impulses in cognition, and conceive of reason generally as an entirely free and self-originating activity. With the development of more philosophic probity and skepticism, such people (which is as much as to say such philosophic self-decep- tion) became impossible. Plato's attempt to mediate among the competing doctrines thus appears to be a necessary development, a higher stage of philosophic self-consciousness, not merely a decline, as in Nietzsche's earlier manuscript. "The human brain was gradually filled with such... ferment ... [that] the intellectual struggle became a business, an attraction, a calling, a duty, an honor: cognizing and striving for the true finally arranged themselves as needs among other needs." Nietzsche tends to associate the search for knowledge as a vocation with Socrates. Without referring to any specific examples, in The Gay Science he notes two crucial aspects or effects of the new intellectual calling: From that moment, not only belief and conviction but also examination, denial, distrust and contradiction becameforces; all "evil" instincts were subordinated to knowledge, were placed in its service, and acquired the prestige of the permitted, the honored, the useful, and finally the appearance and innocence of the good. Knowledge thus became a portion of life itself, and as life it became a continually growing power.</page><page sequence="12">224 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1985 The questioning of the evidence of the senses that emerges with Parmenides necessarily leads to the questioning of moral judgments, because people come to redefine what is permitted, honored, useful- in sum, what is good. The pre-Socratics did not really understand the nature of their own activity. Despite his continuing praise of Herakleitus, Nietzsche does not advocate a return to pre-Socratic philosophy.23 We are left, rather, with the problem he consistently associates with the myth of Socrates: "[N]ow that the impulse to truth has proved itself to be a life-preserving power ... [h]ow far is truth susceptible of embodiment?"24 Plato did not invent the doctrine of the "other" intelligible world, as so many of Nietzsche's critics suggest. Rather, Plato saw that this doctrine or postulate represented the necessary condition for main- taining a certain form or way of life-the only life "truly worth living." As the first to reconceive philosophy as the means of obtaining human happiness, Nietzsche begins to suspect, Plato and his hero- teacher Socrates may have understood more of what they were doing than their successors. Socrates and Plato saw that no human action is "disinterested" or "objective"; on the contrary, they taught that all people, philosophers perhaps preeminently, seek their own conception of what is good.25 For this reason, Nietzsche doubts that Plato believed his own doctrines. "Is Plato's integrity beyond question? [W]e know at least that he wanted to have taught as absolute truth what he himself did not regard as even conditionally true: Namely, the separate existence and separate immortality of 'souls.' "26 Plato taught what was necessary to maintain philosophy as a way of life. Plato understood the dangerous character of philosophy. He saw that philosophy threatens the psychic balance of the philosopher as well as the established conventions of his or her community. To have sufficient faith in oneself, to destroy the old order with confidence that one can replace it with a better, one must be, or at least must appear to be, a little mad. "'It is through madness that the greatest good things have come to Greece,' Plato said, in concert with all ancient mankind."27 More significant, "Plato has given us a splendid description of how the philosophical thinker must within every existing society count as the paragon of all wickedness: for as critic of all customs he is the antithesis of the moral man."28 Perceiving the necessary tension between philosophy and established society (or the polity), Plato recognized the need for philosophers to disguise the radical nature of their activity. The division between the philosopher</page><page sequence="13">Zuckert / REREADING PLATO 225 and the fatherland, to which Nietzsche first referred in his unpub- lished manuscript, results from the philosopher's desire, the "political drive" Plato himself says that he was filled with, to establish a new order in the place of the old. In Plato the philosopher thus appears to be a legislator, not only for others as in The Republic or in Sicily, but also and more importantly for him- or herself. Both Socrates and Plato advocated such a strict, absolute, indeed tyrannical rule of reason, Nietzsche consistently argues, because they both felt themselves in need of such order; their senses were so strong and chaotic. When the physiognomist had revealed to Socrates who he was-a cave of bad appetites-the great master of irony let slip another word which is the key to his character. "This is true," he said, "but I mastered them all." How did Socrates become master over himself "The impulses want to play the tyrant; one must invent a counter-tyrant who is stronger."29 Likewise Nietzsche observes as follows: [Tihe charm of the Platonic way of thinking, which was a noble way of thinking, consisted precisely in resistance to obvious sense-evidence-perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more demanding senses than our contem- poraries, but who know how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of their senses-and this by means of pale, cold, gray concept nets which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses-the mob of the senses, as Plato said.30 Nietzsche does not criticize Plato for attempting to bring order to his own life or that of others, but for disguising the true nature of philosophy as legislation. From his early unpublished manuscript through his later writings, Nietzsche consistently presents legislation (i.e., the declaration of the highest values) as the proper work of the philosopher. Nietzsche recognizes that there is a comprehensive kind of philosophy that gathers together and orders all existing knowledge, the kind that he first associated with the pre-Socratics; this also is the way he characterizes the thought of Kant and Hegel. "Genuine Philosophers, however, are commanders and legislators; they say, 'Thus it Shall be!' . . . This "knowing" is creating, their creating is a legislation, their will to truth is-will to power. "31 In a note for his planned book on the will to power Nietzsche adds, "They alone determine the 'whither' and the 'wherefore,' what is useful and what constitutes utility for men." Plato was such a philosopher. He did not</page><page sequence="14">226 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1985 merely dissimulate, he deceived himself"when he convinced himself that the 'good' as he desired it was not the good of Plato but the 'good in itself,' the eternal treasure that some man named Plato had chanced to discover on his way!"32 Nietzsche does not always appear to be so certain that Plato deceived himself, however. For example, in The Genealogy of Morals he observes as follows: The whole of history teaches that every oligarchy conceals the lust for tyranny, every oligarchy constantly trembles with the tension each member feels in main- taining control over this lust. (So it was in Greece for instance: Plato bears witness to it in a hundred passages-and he knew his own kind-and himself.)33 Nietzsche cannot be certain of Plato's self-understanding precisely because he sees that Plato engages in public teaching. Yet Nietzsche does not attempt to give a true reading of Plato on the basis of a careful reading of the dialogues; instead, he engages in a contest with Plato in order to show the true nature of philosophic activity. Rather than look out beyond him- or herself to another world of eternal being, the philosopher seeks above all to bring order to his or her own feelings and perceptions. Overflowing with joy at achieving this order, the philosopher beneficiently attempts to help others to overcome their pain and confusion by instituting a rule or order for them as well. Nietzsche presents his own, true view of the nature of the philosopher in contrast to -Plato's deceptive presentation most clearly in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Although neither Socrates nor Plato is mentioned in Nietzsche's self-proclaimed masterpiece, Zarathustra is clearly intended to supplant Socrates as the image of the living philosopher. Thus, whereas Socrates is the man who knows only that he does not know, the "gadfly" who constantly interrogates others in the market- place, Zarathustra overflows with wisdom.34 Likewise, whereas Socrates remains always in the marketplace, Zarathustra withdraws to his heights. In terms of Plato's famous allegory of the cave, Socrates is forced to return and remain in the shadows, whereas Zarathustra regularly travels the mountain road between the cave and the sunlight. Like Socrates, Zarathustra recognizes that the people do not understand the philosopher. When he urges them to strive for the "overman," to overcome themselves, they cry out to be "last men"</page><page sequence="15">Zuckert / REREADING PLATO 227 who know neither effort nor goal. "Little do the people comprehend the great-that is, the creating," Zarathustra observes in "On the Flies of the Marketplace." "Around the inventors of new values the world revolves: invisibly it revolves. But around the actors revolve the people and fame: that is 'the way of the world."' These actors or showmen teach the people to regard shadows as unconditional truths. Pressed to take sides in the shadow-box debate about opinions or "ideologies," Zarathustra urges, the philosopher must flee to solitude. He does not flee so much from the danger of political persecution, although Zarathustra recognizes the possibility when thejester warns him (Prologue), as from fear that he will forget himself and in forgetting himself, lose his humanity. "The danger of those who always give is that they lose their sense of shame; and the heart and hand of those who always mete out become callous from always meting out. My eye no longer wells over at the shame of those who beg."35 Unlike Plato's philosopher who must be forced to descend to the cave, Zarathustra both descends and withdraws from the city out of love, love for people.36 Recognizing that most people never will understand him, Zarathustra does not speak to them directly, except to expose the pretentions of former sages, priests, and politicians. He does not try to persuade people to accept any claim or doctrine; to persuade them would necessarily be to delude them, to convince them of a proposition the grounds of which they do not understand. Zarathustra does not preach or argue, therefore, so much as he sings. Even then, he is ashamed that he must still speak as a poet, because he observes that poets always lie.37 Nietzsche himself recognizes the necessarily indirect character of the communication between philosopher and reader when he speaks through the mouth of a character named Zarathustra. I have not been asked, as I should have been asked, what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth, the mouth of the first immoralist.... Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the metaphysical realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is his work.... Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it.... What is more important is that Zarathustra is more truthful than any other thinker.38 As the people cannot understand his or her words, the most the philosopher can do is to show who he or she is, a task Nietzsche himself attempts with shocking directness in Ecce Homo, where he</page><page sequence="16">228 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1985 explains "Why I Am So Wise" and "Why I Write Such Good Books." The truth does not lie in any opinion, doctrine, or teaching. Any philosophy that attempts to teach (i.e., to persuade anyone of anything) Nietzsche argues, necessarily lies. All previous philosophy, at least all philosophy since Plato, has propagated such lies by teaching that there is an intelligible order by which people can orient themselves. As Plato himself shows, political orders are based on moral teachings, which in turn rest upon "metaphysical" claims. Nietzsche seeks to expose Plato's lies, but he does not criticize him so much for deceiving the people. Nietzsche also sees that the people cannot understand the philosopher and that the philosopher needs protection. The disguise they have most often assumed, he observes in The Genealogy of Morals, is the cloth of the priest. Let us compress the facts into a few brief formulas: to begin with the philosophic spirit always had to use as a mask and cocoon the previously established types of the contemplative man-priest, sorcerer, soothsayer, and in any case a religious type-in order to be able to exist at all: the ascetic ideal for a long time served the philosopher as a form in which to appear, as a precondition of existence-he had to represent it so as to be able to be a philosopher; he had to believe in it in order to be able to represent it.39 Nietzsche attributed such an ascetic misunderstanding to the Eleatic philosophers in The Gay Science. He is not sure that Plato so misun- derstood himself. Plato recognized the need for philosophic disguise. Like the priests, moreover, Plato understood that it was necessary to lie in order to rule. That the lie is permitted as a means to pious ends is part of the theory of every priesthood.... But philosophers, too, as soon as, with priestly ulterior motives, they form the intention of taking in hand the direction of mankind, at once also arrogate to themselves the right to tell lies: Plato before all.40 Those who would make others moral must themselves use immoral means, Nietzsche insists.4' "It is a mistake to suppose an uncon- scious and naive development here, a kind of self-deception.... The most cold-blooded reflection was at work here; the same kind of reflection as a Plato applied when he imagined his 'Republic.' "42 Nietzsche himself calls these the "grand politics of virtue . . . pure Machiavellianism ... at most approximated by man. .. Even Plato barely touched it."43</page><page sequence="17">Zuckert / REREADING PLATO 229 Nietzsche does not criticize Plato for wanting to rule. On the contrary, Zarathustra comments, "The lust to rule-but who would call it lust when what is high longs downward for power? Verily, there is nothing diseased or lustful in such longing and condescending . [g]ift-giving virtue."44 Nietzsche finally criticizes Plato for dissimulation. Plato himself seems to have understood the tremendously self-affirmative character of philosophic activity. For example, in explaining "how the 'true world' finally became a fable" in the Twilight ofthe Idols, Nietzsche summarizes the first stage: "I, Plato, am the truth." Plato did not really teach the existence of another world, Nietzsche suggests, so much as he affirmed his own existence. "The true world-attainable for the sage, the pious, the virtuous man; he lives in it, he is it."45 Whether Plato truly believed his own doctrines or not, his followers did. Thus, in the "Preface" to Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche attacks Plato as the founder of dogmatic philosophy. "It seems that all great things first have to bestride the earth in monstrous and frightening masks in order to inscribe themselves in the hearts of humanity with eternal demands: dogmatic philosophy was such a mask: for example . . . Platonism in Europe." Even if it represents a mask, as Nietzsche suggests, "[i]t must certainly be conceded that the worst, most durable, and most dangerous of all errors so far is a dogmatist's error-namely, Plato's invention ofthe pure spirit [mind] and the good as such." Plato's doctrines suggest that philosophy consists in the search for knowledge of something beyond man-an immortal, incorporeal, infinite "Good," Geist, or God-which as the negation of mortality, corporeality, and finitude constitutes the negation of the limits and so the very definition of human existence. Plato's doctrines, indeed, even his hero Socrates, prove to be essen- tially nihilistic, as Heidegger emphasizes. In the preface to Beyond Good andEvil, Nietzsche seems to return to his initial view of the relation between Socrates and Plato when he observes that "as a physician one might ask: 'How could the most beautiful growth of antiquity, Plato, contract such a disease? Did the wicked Socrates corrupt him after all? Could Socrates have been the corrupter of youth after all? And did he deserve his hemlock?"' But later he makes both the nature of corruption he attributes to Socrates and the difference he now sees between teacher and pupil much clearer, when he observes as follows: There is something in the morality of Plato that does not really belong to Plato but is merely encountered in his philosophy-one might say, in spite of Plato:</page><page sequence="18">230 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1985 namely, the Socratism for which he was really too noble. "Nobody wants to do harm to himself, therefore, all that is bad is done involuntarily . . . " This type of inference smells of the rabble that sees nothing in bad actions but the unpleasant consequences. Plato is not merely Socrates's student; on the contrary, Socrates repre- sents the mouthpiece or mask of Plato. Plato did everything he could in order to read something refined and noble into the proposition of his teacher-above all, himself. He was the most audacious of all interpreters and took the whole Socrates only the way one picks a popular tune and folk song from the streets in order to vary it into the infinite and impossible-namely, into all of his own masks and multiplicities.46 Nietzsche also states clearly in Ecce Homo that he does not regard Plato merely as a follower, much less the dupe of Socrates.47 Nietzsche consistently distinguishes Plato from his teacher Socrates in one and only one respect: whereas Plato is noble, Socrates is vulgar. Nietzsche distinguishes Plato from his popular influence or effect, Christianity, on precisely the same ground. "[Tlhe fight against Plato or, to speak more clearly and 'for the people,' the fight against the Christian-ecclesiastical pressure of millenia-for Chris- tianity is Platonism for'the people'-has created in Europe a magnifi- cent tension of the spirit"48 By explicitly linking Plato with Christianity, Nietzsche indicates the extent to which his understanding of philosophy in general and Plato in particular has changed from his first treatise. Nietzsche does not mention Christianity at all in The Birth of Tragedy, as he himself notes in his later "Attempt at Self-Criticism," whereas in his later work Christianity often appears to be the major result or effect of Platonic philosophy. By associating Plato with Christianity, Nietzsche by no means makes a simply negative or critical statement. Whether in philosophic or religious form, Nietzsche insists, the denial of the value of this life, this world, in favor of another is a sign of decadence and weakness. Nevertheless, it has (or can have) beneficial effects. Thus, in the preface to Beyond Good and Evil, he also writes, "Let us not be ungrateful to it . . [for] we . .. are the heirs of all that strength which has been fostered by the fight against this error... . The fight against Plato." "Ascetic ideals," as he calls them in The Genealogy of Morals, the denial of the world of appearance, sensuality, body, and finitude in favor of the eternal, the intellectual, the immortal, and infinite-in a</page><page sequence="19">Zuckert / REREADING PLATO 231 word, "God"-have their uses. They have, in the first place, produced the intellectual discipline necessary for the emergence of the "phi- losophy of the future." [P]recisely because we seek knowledge, let us not be ungrateful to such resolute reversals of accustomed perspectives and valuations with which the spirit has, with apparent mischievousness and futility, raged against itself for so long: to see differently in this way for once, to want to see differently, is no small discipline and preparation of the intellect for its future ... ability ... to employ a variety of perspectives and affective interpretations in the service of knowledge.49 It is, indeed, in terms of the uses of ascetic ideals that Nietzsche ultimately distinguishes philosophy from religion. Whereas most philosophers point to a fundamental distinction between reason and revelation, Nietzsche denies it. Philosophy or reason has instinctual roots, he insists; there is no mind separate from body and therefore no mind or imagination separate from physiological states. Thought originates in or as a feeling, an insight or hunch of the sort often described as a revelation. [Philosophers] all pose as if they had discovered and reached their real opinions through the self-development of a cold, pure, divinely unconcerned dialectic (as opposed to the mystics of every rank, who are more honest and doltish-and talk of'"inspiration"); while at bottom it is an assumption, a hunch, indeed a kind of "inspiration"-most often a desire of the heart that has been filtered and made abstract.50 What distinguishes the philosopher from the priest or the poet is not the source of his or her wisdom, but the stance he or she takes toward his or her own existence. Both priests and philosophers are legis- lators."1 Whereas the priest teaches ascetic ideals as a reaction against the existing order, as a negation of the value of this life, particularly of his own life, except insofar as he serves to ameliorate the suffering of others and thereby his own, the philosopher embraces ascetic ideals instinctively as the optimal conditions for philosophy. What, then, is the meaning of the ascetic ideal in the case of a philosopher? . . . The philosopher sees in it an optimum condition for the highest and boldest spirituality and smiles-he does not deny "existence," he rather affirms his existence and only his existence.52 And Plato is the first, the preeminent teacher of ascetic ideals.</page><page sequence="20">232 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1985 Although he often blurs the distinction, Nietzsche does finally sepa- rate philosophy from its influence.53 In the case of both Socrates and Plato, the influence consists of an illusion-the possibility of correcting human existence with knowledge in the case of Socrates, the positing of another world in Plato-which it is not clear the philosopher shares. In his final description of "The Problem of Socrates" in Twilight of the Idols, Nietzsche makes only one, but one very significant, change. Although Nietzsche still maintains that Socrates arranged his own death, he now gives Socrates's most distinctive act another interpretation: Was this what he said to himself in the end, in the wisdom of his courage to die? Socrates wanted to die . . . he forced Athens to sentence him. "Socrates is no physician," he said softly to himself; "here death alone is the physician. Socrates himself has merely been sick a long time."54 At the end of his career, Nietzsche thus comes to suspect that "this most brilliant of all self-outwitters" also saw that fighting the instincts can only be a mark of decadence or declining life. The ancient theological problem of "faith" and "knowledge"-or, more clearly, of instinct and reason . . . is still the ancient moral problem that emerged in the person of Socrates and divided thinking people long before Christianity. Socrates himself, to be sure . .. had initially sided with reason; . . . what did he do his life long but laugh at the awkward incapacity of noble Athenians who, like noble men, were men of instinct and never could give sufficient . .. reasons for their actions? In the end, however, privately and secretly, he laughed at himself, too.... This was the realfalseness of that great ironic, he had seen through the irrational element in moral judgments.55 Dialectics is the tool of the weak, and Socrates was emphatically common. "Is the irony of Socrates an expression ... of plebian ressentiment? Is dialectics only a form of revenge in Socrates?"56 Socra- tes uses dialectic to show the inadequacies of other moralities, noble moralities, but he does not really believe his own moral teaching. In The Birth of Tragedy Nietzsche argued that Socrates embodied the optimis- tic illusion that man could come not only to comprehend but also to correct his existence by attaining knowledge. "Knowledge is virtue." Here he suggests that Socrates may have intentionally misled his noble young Athenian auditors. One fears death only so long as one is at- tached to life. Socrates represents not the first optimist but a more knowing pessimist who conceals the insight or knowledge he has ob-</page><page sequence="21">Zuckert / REREADING PLATO 233 tained about himself through his own experience. His actions tell more than his words. Did Plato mislead later philosophers as Socrates misled the Athenian nobles? It would require a much more detailed study of the Platonic corpus than that Nietzsche provides to prove his claims. Nevertheless, some of the well-known characteristics of Platonic dialogues make Nietzsche's reading at least plausible. For example, in the dialogues Plato never speaks in his own name; he speaks only through the mouths of different characters (masks?). Socrates is not his only philosophic spokesman, but we never hear any two philoso- phers, Parmenides and the mature Socrates, or the Eleatic stranger and Timaeus, exchange views and come to an agreement in conversation with one another. Plato does present a variety of philosophic positions, but he does not mediate them, at least not directly. Rather, each particular dialogue presents the question at hand from a somewhat different perspective. Through reading the corpus we begin to suspect that no one position or perspective is, in itself, complete. Many of the most famous Platonic "doctrines" are explicitly presented, moreover, as stories or myths first heard from priests or as images, like the famous divided line and cave in The Republic. Socrates himself is presented as consistently coming to certain moral-sounding conclu- sions-for example, it is better to suffer than to commit injustice; but by insisting that these conclusions are tentative (i.e., open to question) Socrates clearly indicates that he thinks they have not been definitively proved. At the very least, Nietzsche's reading of Plato forces us to recon- sider both the nature and the history of Western philosophy. If Nietzsche is even approximately correct, we need to reconceive both Platonic philosophy and the misconception to which it gave rise. Rather than define philosophy by its object, we need to think of it in terms of an ordering activity that produces a great sense of self- satisfaction and yet continues on the basis of the perception that no order is complete. Although all moralities are founded upon such supreme acts of legislation, according to Nietzsche, the philosopher or legislator is "beyond good and evil." Having mistaken philosophy for the search for truth, Nietzsche claims, philosophers following Plato actually were, although unknowingly, trying to secure the foun- dations of "majestic moral structures." Not understanding what they were doing, however, these philosophers gradually disclosed the ab- sence of any foundation for morality and so defeated themselves (and</page><page sequence="22">234 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1985 the original Platonic project?) in their unremitting search for "the truth." Nietzsche's reinterpretation of the history of philosophy is not the only one possible, of course. In seeking to show that Western rationalism is inherently nihilistic and thus ultimately technological, Heidegger drops Nietzsche's central concern with morality. The first question raised by attempts following Nietzsche's to reinterpret the tradition is thus whether the decisive turns, developments, or apparent breaks in the history of philosophy can be understood without regard to the moral dimension.57 Is philosophy to be affirmed as the only life worth living? The second, more fundamental question, perhaps, is whether or to what extent there is one tradition at all: Did all philoso- phers desire to have an effect? Did they, as Nietzsche suggests, all wish to rule the world by transforming it? If Nietzsche is correct, Plato had tremendous influence, even though his project ultimately failed. He failed because he concealed the true nature of philosophic activity. Nietzsche does not damn Plato for lying to protect philosophy from political persecution or even to help the nonphilosophers; Nietzsche damns Plato primarily for lying to and about himself. The final question, therefore, must be, why? Why did Plato lie about his own activity? At times Nietzsche suggests that Plato simply lacked the courage to face the full implica- tions of instituting a new order; at other times, however, Nietzsche intimates that Plato may have known full well what he was doing. Again, Nietzsche points to the need for a new critical reading of Plato in terms of his exoteric and esoteric teachings, which cannot be duplicated here.58 Nevertheless, Nietzsche's own presentation of philosophy provides a place from which to begin reflections on the possible need for dissimulation. Philosophy, as Nietzsche presents it, is inherently critical and destructive, as Plato himself recognized; it is particularly destructive of the nomoi (established laws, opinions, and mores) upon which communities are based. If all views are perspectival and hence partial, all nomoi are also; the nomoi, therefore, are always open to criticism and destruction by those who would simply resist discipline as well as by philosophers who would replace them with a new and better order.59 To create a new order, the philosopher has to com- municate with nonphilosophers who are incapable of understanding him or her. That is, he or she must speak their language, which means not only using "native," though highly conventional tongues, but also employing an essentially popular, poetic, and ultimately "religious" mode of expressing ideas in terms of anthropomorphic images. To</page><page sequence="23">Zuckert / REREADING PLATO 235 perpetuate his or her new order, once established, moreover, the philosopher must seek to protect it from criticism. Appearing now as defender rather than critic of the established order, philosophy conceals both its destructive potential and creative thrust. Like Plato, the philosopher presents his or her order as discovered and founded in nature, not as made and imposed. The destructive potential of phi- losophy can be revealed only gradually, even to would-be philosophers, because the radical insecurity that accompanies insight into the incompleteness or partiality of all claims is impossible for most people to bear, much less to enjoy. Most people will recoil into dogged self-affirmation and the false security of the senses, unless the philosopher teaches them, however indirectly, something higher. If the philosopher's dissimulation is intendedto preserve philosophy, Nietzsche finally charges, that dissimulation fails, because it directs all future philosophic effort to either the sisyphean, ultimately fruitless search for "the truth" or the relief of people's (i.e. the common people's) estate. It deprives philosophers, indeed, all people of the image if not the experience of a life truly worth living and so finally leads philosophers, the most truthful of all people, into despair. Nietzsche's own insight into the esoteric character of Platonic phi- losophy tends, however, to vitiate the force of his argument. If Plato is a true philosopher, philosophy is possible at different if not at all times; it is not simply a product of the Nietzschean historical moment or the development leading to it. Philosophy does, however, seem to presuppose a certain intellectual development and communal memory.60 Although Nietzsche recognizes the function of "anti- quarian history" and its largely political (or popular) expression and roots in his early essay on "The Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life," in his later works he presents the philosopher as entirely and necessarily a solitary figure. We cannot help but wonder how this philosopher can serve as an "inventor of new values" if he or she cannot communicate them in some fashion to nonphilosophers. Hence, Nietzsche finally sends us also to reread Plato as, at least potentially, thepolitical alternative to modern philosophic impotence and estrangement. NOTES 1. Ignoring the difference between dogmatic Platonism, which is essentially nihilistic according to Nietzsche, and Plato's own activity, which is essentially self-affirming,</page><page sequence="24">236 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1985 Martin Heidegger, Nietzsche (Pfullingen: Verlag Guenther Neske, 1961), trans. in part by David Farrell Krell (New York: Harper and Row, 1979), concludes that Nietzsche brings Western metaphysics to an end by showing its essentially nihilistic core. Whereas Nietz- sche's thought culminates in the desire that everything (including the history of Western philosophy) reoccur exactly as it has-eternally-Heidegger seeks to overcome Western rationalism entirely. Although French commentators such as Jacques Derrida criticize Heidegger for departing from the truly radical perspectivism of Nietzsche in a search for the Being of all beings (i.e., for an essential unity or truth), they too stress Nietzsche's critique of Platonic ideas, indeed of any ideals, constants, or identities without seeing this criticism as the preparation, but only the preparation, as Nietzsche himself insists, for a possible final affirmation.

When recent critics such as Gilles Deleuze recognize the importance of the final affirmation in Nietzsche's new conception of truth, history, and philosophy, they reject it on political grounds, because they see that the solitary character of Nietzschean philosophy makes community impossible.

Leo Strauss is famous for having revived the notion that texts have both exoteric and esoteric teachings and has applied that insight particularly to Plato. See Persecution and the Art of Writing (New York: Free Press, 1952). Strauss does not altogether agree with Nietzsche's reading of Plato. See City and Man (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1964), pp. 50-138. Although he introduces his analysis of Socrates and Aristophanes (New York: Basic, 1966), pp. 6-8, with a reference to Nietzsche's interpretation of Socrates in The Birth of Tragedy, Strauss also disagrees with both Nietzsche and Heidegger about the unidimensionality of the philosophic tradition when he argues that the search for "the effective truth" begins with Machiavelli. Thoughts on Machiavelli (New York: Free Press, 1952). There is, Strauss often argues, a fundamental difference between the ancients and the moderns: the intention of ancient political philosophy is different.
