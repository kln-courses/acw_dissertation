<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reading Thoreau* 's Animals Michelle C. Neely Thoreau writes about animals wonderfully, and often. In Waiden , The Maine Woods , the Journal, some of the essays, and elsewhere he shows himself to be a careful and sympathetic observer of nonhuman animal life, yet his ethical reasoning from his observations does not always please. Walderìs exploration of the ethical, intellectual, and spiritual consequences of taking animal life in particular seems frequently to annoy both readers and critics put off by what they see as Thoreau's "exasperating" fixation on purity,1 but even Thoreau's fine depictions of squirrels, chickadees, and other "brute neighbors" in Waiden , the Journals, and other writings can be dismissed as fanciful flights of anthropomorphism. Perhaps Thoreau's "instinct" about killing animals and consuming animal bodies cannot be conveyed to those who have never felt its like; ethical insights can be individual and incommunicable, a truth the philosopher Cora Diamond calls "the difficulty of reality" (I Valden 213; Diamond 45-6, 92). But some of the value of reading Thoreau's animals, and the challenging nature of his thinking about the material world, can, I think, be illuminated. In the essay that follows, I will offer a brief close reading of one of Walderì s most famous "animal" passages and then explore some of the more significant ways in which Thoreau's engagement with nonhuman animals resonates with recent theoretical developments in posthumanism, new materialism, materialist ecocriticism, and object- oriented ontology. Ultimately, I wish to demonstrate that Thoreau's animal thought frequently decenters the human and displays his commitment to giving "materiality its due," as Diana Coole and Samantha Frost have said of "the New Materialisms" more generally. In the process, I will make a case for paying greater attention to the way that Thoreau's ethical thought is often grounded in careful observation of the material. Finally, I will argue that Thoreau's evident pleasure in boundary confusion is an important part of his ability to imagine a more open and ecological form of community. * * * The Concord Saunterer : A Journal of Thoreau Studies , N.S. Vol. 22, 2014</page><page sequence="2">Michelle C. Neely 127 One of the most famous "animal" passages in Waiden is surely the two-sentence portion of "Higher Laws" that reads, No humane being, past the thoughtless age of boyhood, will wantonly murder any creature, which holds its life by the same tenure that he does. The hare in its extremity cries like a child. I warn you, mothers, that my sympathies do not always make the usual pYiú-anthropic distinctions. (213) Often excerpted in animal welfare literature, this passage seems simple on the surface, and Thoreau's use of the word "murder" is a perfect example of the moral "excess" so annoying to many readers of "Higher Laws." Yet more focused attention uncovers several richly suggestive features of this famous passage. First, Thoreau's use of the word "tenure" is fascinating. "Tenure," from the thirteenth century onward, is the word used in English Law to describe holding land or real property, and by the sixteenth century it also signifies more general occupation or the holding of something. By using "tenure" in the phrase "holds its life by the same tenure that he does," Thoreau turns the "creature" into the owner of itself, of its own "life" - a possessive individual, in other words. Possessive individualism is at the heart of liberal democratic rights theory,2 and by extending it to nonhuman "creatures," Thoreau expands the grounds for imagining rights beyond the human; the nonhuman "holds" its life by the same "tenure" as the human "creature" and has a right to its own life as a result. Thoreau's use of the word "creature" is itself interesting, and prescient: one of posthumanism's key moves has been to trouble the terms "the animal" and "animals" by pointing out that the vast diversity of nonhuman animal life is impoverished by being placed into a "catch-all concept" whose chief organizing principle is "animal but not human" (Derrida 34). Instead, posthumanist and animal studies theorists have embraced terms such "creatures" or "critters" that emphasize the shared embodiment and inevitable entanglement of human and nonhuman lives.3 Even more interesting, however, is the way in which Thoreau's ethical claim in this brief passage grows out of a direct engagement with the materiality of rabbit being; "the hare in its extremity cries like a child" is a fact - rabbits, when extremely frightened, emit a terrified cry that many report sounds like a child</page><page sequence="3">128 The Concord S aunterer: A. Journal ofThoreau Studies screaming. Thus, observation of rabbit behavior becomes an occasion for ethical thought: Thoreau's response to the rabbit's childlike sound is to propose a more expansive motherhood that recognizes the "hare" as kin, as a child whose life should be protected; unlike most human "mothers," Thoreau tells us, his "sympathies" do not stop at the species line. His "love" is not simply for the human child, as his italicized pun "phil -anthropiť makes clear. Expanding his sympathy beyond the human and granting nonhuman animals the possessive right to their own lives are both bound up with the anthropomorphic comparison "like a child." Does this anthropomorphism lessen the ethical force of Thoreau's statement? During the mid-nineteenth century, anthropomorphism was still a legitimate epistemic register for engaging animal life,4 although it was on the wane in scientific circles and would be thoroughly suppressed with the rise of behaviorism in the early twentieth century. Yet the issue is not closed; in our contemporary moment, scholars in all fields are beginning to reopen the question of anthropomorphism in serious ways, pointing to the anthropo centńsm of remaining willfully blind to shared human and nonhuman traits, a practice Frans de Waal has usefully termed "anthropodenial."5 In the case of Waiden , and in much of Thoreau's work, I would like to suggest that anthropomorphism is a mode rich with ethical and epistemological possibilities: for Thoreau the naturalist, philosopher, and poet, anthropomorphism is not simply an act of imagination, it's also frequently a fact of attention to the ontology of the nonhuman. Moreover, it has real ethical possibilities. Kari Weil, building on trauma theory's concept of "critical empathy" as a "conjunction of affect and critical awareness that may be understood to constitute the basis of an empathy not grounded in affinity," has suggested that we call an ethical relating to animals (whether in theory or in art) "critical anthropomorphism" in the sense that we open ourselves to touch and be touched by others as fellow subjects and may imagine their pain, pleasure, and need in anthropomorphic terms, but stop short of believing that we can know their experience. (20)</page><page sequence="4">Michelle C. Neely 129 Thoreau's anthropomorphism is indeed a vehicle for imagining nonhumans as fellow subjects and for noticing the shared experience of being. What is shared, most fundamentally, is mortality and a vulnerability to pain, hunger, and "the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to," as Hamlet put it. "Shall we not have sympathy with the muskrat which gnaws its third leg off- -not as pitying its sufferings but through our kindred mortality appreciating its majestic pains &amp; its heroic virtue Are we not made its brothers by fate[?]" Thoreau muses in an 1854 Journal entry celebrating a muskrat's attempt to free itself from a trap (7: 267). It is this recognition of the shared bodily experience of human and nonhuman creatures that leads Thoreau to characterize animal killing as "murder" in the passage with which I began.6 Donna Haraway, following Derrida, claims that the question of murder is at the heart of human exceptionalism, the claim of absolute difference between human and nonhuman animals. In When Species Meet , she writes, "only human beings can be murdered - Every living being except Man can be killed but not murdered. To make Man merely killable is the height of moral outrage; indeed, it is the definition of genocide" (78). For this reason, using the word "murder" to describe the deliberate killing of animals is not simple hyperbole; it's a fundamental challenge to the anthropocentric logic by which only human lives merit moral consideration. After Thoreau describes the brutal ant battle he witnesses in "Brute Neighbors," he disrupts the easy distinction between the value and meaning of human and nonhuman death when he reflects, "I was myself excited somewhat even as if they had been men. The more you think of it, the less the difference" (230). I have tried to explore some of the complexities of the brief passage with which I began. But what larger significances can be teased out of my relatively close reading of this one short example? First, I think the passage suggests that one of the most radical elements of Thoreau's thought is its insistence that the ethical and the material must, and do, exist in relation to one another.7 His complicated ruminations on animal food in "Higher Laws" are finally summed up thusly: "It is hard to provide and cook so simple and clean a diet as will not offend the imagination; but this, I think, is to be fed when we feed the body; they should both sit down at the same table" (215). Far from rejecting bodily experience, or attempting an airy transcendence of it, Thoreau claims to be "thrilled</page><page sequence="5">130 The Concord S aunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies to think that I owed a mental perception to the commonly gross sense of taste, that I have been inspired through the palate, that some berries which I had eaten on a hill-side had fed my genius" (218). No ideas but in things, as William Carlos Williams has it, and Thoreau might add, no ethics but in things, either. Moreover, I also think the exemplary passage about the hare suggests the remarkable manner in which Thoreau decenter s the human,8 a practice he continues throughout Waiden by representing himself as one "neighbor" among many - human and "brute" alike.9 Thoreau famously writes his book to "wake [his] neighbors up" (81), but he balances his critique of his human neighbors with descriptions of the modes of life of his "brute neighbors." In Thoreau's repeated use of the term "neighbor," we seem meant to hear the word's New Testament resonances. Jesus tells the parable of the Good Samaritan in response to "an expert in the law" quoting the commandment to "love thy neighbor as thyself' and asking him, "And who is my neighbor"? The Samaritan parable that results is about the ethics of compassion, and how compassion or pity (depending on the translation) results in care for a wounded body (King James Bible , Luke 10.25-37). Thoreau cheekily rejects this definition of human goodness in "Economy" as too limited: "A man is not a good man to me because he will feed me if I should be starving, or warm me if I should be freezing, or pull me out of a ditch if I should ever fall into one. I can find you a Newfoundland dog that will do as much" (74). Notably, the Good Samaritan standard is not enough for Thoreau because it is not distinctly human, as he emphasizes with his italics. Humans and nonhuman animals share the experience of bodily vulnerability, and Thoreau's recognition of this is the foundation for the expanded community invoked by his neighborly interest in both human and nonhuman animals in Waiden and his recognition that each has interests: What though I value the seed of these beans, and harvest that in the fall of the year? The broad field which I have looked at so long looks not to me as the principal cultivator, but away from me to influences more genial to it, which water and make it green. These beans have results which are not harvested by me. Do they not grow for woodchucks partly?. . . How, then, can our harvest fail? Shall I not</page><page sequence="6">Michelle C. Neely 131 rejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary of the birds? (166) Thoreau here rejects the Judeo-Chrisdan idea of dominion, the idea that all of creation is made for man (and man thus has a right to use it in whatever manner he pleases),10 in order to celebrate a posthumanist ecology. Walderìs response to the ethical question at the center of the Good Samaritan parable - "And who is my neighbor?" - is a vision of the profound entanglement of matter, in which each of the separate elements of Thoreau's description - the broad field, the sun, the human farmer, the beans, woodchucks, weeds, and birds - have independent needs and interests that are bound up with but not wholly contained within any other particular element. The survival of each element is uncertain and contingent. Remarkably, Thoreau finds in this vision a reason to "rejoice." He takes materiality seriously and as a result is able to imagine a human identity that does not exist apart from nature and to express the continuity between humans and other forms of life. This does not mean that Thoreau represents human life as "the same" as nonhuman life; no one who has read him could believe this. Rather, we should notice that when he quotes Mencius as saying, "That in which men differ from brute beasts... is a thing very inconsiderable," or offers us his own versions of this sentiment, both the similarities and the differences matter (219). Both make their demands on human beings. * I would like to conclude by suggesting one further interesting feature of the elements of Thoreau's writing that I have been trying to bring forward. Namely, as my last example from Waiden suggests, Thoreau's intensive observation of material phenomena can trouble boundaries not only between the human and the nonhuman but also between the animate and the inanimate, as he himself observed: "I mistook the creaking of a tree in the woods the other day for the scream of a hawk. How numerous the resemblances of the animate to the inanimate!" he writes in a January 10, 1854, Journal entry (7: 235). In Haraway's now-classic "Cyborg Manifesto," she claims that there is "a pleasure in the confusion of boundaries" - a pleasure that should be embraced and celebrated for its ability to break us out</page><page sequence="7">132 The Concord S aunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies of a narrow and confining humanism (150). Thoreau's attention to the details of the material world and his evident pleasure in likenesses and echoes that transgress the supposedly firm boundaries between the human and the nonhuman, the animate and the inanimate, allow him to look beyond the humanist foundations of the ethical. The complexities of Thoreau's attention to the material, and in the case of nonhuman animals, a recognition of shared embodiment, finally suggest the potential for a more open and ecological understanding of community, one founded in the often surprising points of ontological contact between forms of life rather than in narrow identity. NOTES 1. Richard J. Schneider writes, "most readers find 'Higher Laws'... to be exasperating in its puritanic insistence on the virtues of a vegetarian diet" (100). Nancy Mayer's consideration of the ethics on display in "Higher Laws" is also representative of this position when Mayer claims that "Thoreau doesn't, after all, really have much to say about actual animals, and, towards the end of the chapter, the whole argument dissolves discouragingly into a prudish diatribe against coffee, tea, and gluttony that begins to sound suspiciously like an unwitting revelation of the author's private foibles" (27). In this essay I hope to demonstrate that Thoreau does, in fact, have important things to say about "actual animals" and, as I have argued elsewhere, Thoreau's "prudish diatribe" against the substances named by Mayer is in fact a complex intervention into antebellum debates about capitalism, citizenship, freedom, and the body. For this argument, see Neely, 33-60. 2. See for instance McPherson. 3. See for instance Donna Haraway's use of "critters" throughout When Species Meet and Cora Diamond's discussion of the implications of treating animals as "fellow creatures" in "Eating Meat and Eating People" (328-9). Derrida himself coins "l'animot" to signify the constructedness and "stupidity" of the singular "Animal with a capital A" in The Animal that Therefore I Am (31-41 and throughout). 4.

In his annotated edition of Waiden , Jeffrey Cramer points out that Thoreau made other references to taking an animal's life as "murder." In The Maine Woods Thoreau uses the word to describe the moose killing, and in an 1847 letter he uses the word to describe killing animals for scientific specimens. See Waiden: A Fully Annotated Hdition (204). 7. Michael Gilmore has made this point in a Marxist mode in his reading of Waiden. 8. Thoreau's decentering of the human overlaps with the critical projects of posthumanism, object-oriented ontology, and many strands of ecocriticism. For examples of the ways these different theoretical approaches decenter the human, see for instance Wolfe's What is Posthumanismì, Bryant's The Democracy of Objects, or Garrard's Ecocnticism. 9. Two recent, wonderful discussions of Thoreau, "neighboring," and the nonhuman are Kristen Case's analysis of "knowing as neighboring" and Thomas Pughe's discussion of "brute neighbors." 10.
