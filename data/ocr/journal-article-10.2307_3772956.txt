<plain_text><page sequence="1">Men of Anger and Men of Shame: Lakalai Ethnopsychology and Its Implications for Sociopsychological Theory1 C. A. Valentine University of Washington The cognitive and conceptual systems which men develop and employ to understand themselves and the world about them have long been a central concern of anthropology. This preoccupation goes back at least to the pioneer inquiries by Tylor (1871) into primitive concepts of the soul and kindred topics. Later authorities have repeatedly returned to the study of man as thinker, philosopher, and scientist in the most diverse social and cultural settings (e.g., Levy-Bruhl 1923, Malinowski 1925, Radin 1927). More recent studies have included investigations of particular systems of "folk science" (LaBarre 1942, 1947) and cross-cultural comparisons of specific theories bearing on the nature of man (Wallace 1958). In the last ten years, heightened interest and increasingly systematic attention have been devoted by anthropologists and others to a field of investigation which is now called "ethnoscience" (Conklin 1954, 1955, 1960, 1962; Frake 1961, 1962; French 1956; Ray 1952, 1953). In a useful review paper the subject matter of studies in ethnoscience is described as "a people's knowledge or beliefs about the structure and processes of the universe" (French 1963:392). The present essay deals with one aspect of the ethnoscience of a particular people, the Lakalai of New Britain. The phrase "Lakalai ethnopsychology" is employed here to denote a culturally patterned, linguistically mediated cognitive system through which this people perceive and conceptualize human psychological variability. This usage is in accord with the descriptive definition given to "ethno? psychology" in the Outline of Cultural Materials (Murdock et al. 1950: 137). "Ethnopsychology" in the present context thus has a meaning which is distinct from that which is often assigned to the same term in studies of "ethnic psychology" or "folk psychology." In many such contexts, from the earlier evolutionist and recapitula- tionist psychologies (Hallowell 1939) to certain contemporary schools 441</page><page sequence="2">442 ETHNOLOGY of thought in comparative developmental psychology (Werner and Kaplan 1956, Werner 1961), "ethnopsychology" and similar labels are applied to investigations of group psychological characteristics. The primary focus of the present discussion is not upon the nature of Lakalai personality variables as such but rather upon the ways in which psychological reality is conceptualized by the Lakalai. In the study of human behavior there is a fundamental duality of method which can perhaps be described in its most general form as the division between the concrete, descriptive, particularistic ap? proach of history and the more abstract, comparative, generalizing approach of science. The dichotomy in this form has played an important part in the development of anthropological method and theory (Bidney 1953, Redfield 1953), while the kindred distinction between idiographic and nomothetic approaches has appeared princi? pally in psychology (Allport 1942) but also in other human studies (Gottschalk et al. 1945). Linguistics has been the source of a recent restatement of this dualism which seems particularly applicable to the study of ethnoscience. Thus Pike (1955) has called attention to what he calls the "emic" approach of analyzing a behavioral system in its own terms by discovering the structural units and classes inherent in the system, which he contrasts with the "etic" approach of analysis through application of universalistic categories brought to the data by the investigator. This distinction has influenced work in the field of ethnoscience (e.g., Frake 1961), and its special relevance to studies of cognition has been shown by French (1963: 398-401). In the latter discussion, a step-by-step combination of these two complementary methodological orientations is proposed as the ideal approach to many problems. The present investigation of Lakalai ethnopsychology is designed to accord with the spirit of this proposal. In the present essay the use of symbolic logic and componential analysis (Wallace 1962) is eschewed, without prejudice against their untility in studies of cog? nition, in favor of a more discursive approach. What is attempted here is also related conceptually to earlier suggestions, in a different context, for narrowing the gap between the two basic methodological orientations in the study of man (Valentine 1960, 1961b). Lakalai Society The Lakalai people are a linguistic group with a population of approximately 3,000 situated on the northern shore of New Britain in Melanesia. The Lakalai tongue, also known as Bileki, is a dialect of the Nakanai language which has recently been assigned to the Central Oceanic division of the Austronesian or Malayo-Polynesian language family (Goodenough 1961). The Lakalai practice shifting cultivation with a typical array of Melanesian garden crops. Supplementary subsistence activities include pig raising, hunting, fishing, and gathering wild foods. Gradual and partial integration into the colonial economy of the</page><page sequence="3">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 443 Territory of New Guinea since the turn of the century has resulted in varying periods of plantation labor away from home for most males, peripheral participation in the cash economy, and the intro? duction of a modest quantity of steel tools and other manufactured items of European material culture. In the last few years co-operative production of copra and cocoa has been started on a small scale (Valentine 1958). Lakalai social structure generally conforms to the Patri-Iroquois type as defined by Murdock (1949: 243-245). Matrilineal descent is the major organizing principle, with lineages, sibs, and phratries all in evidence. The sib {maratatila) is the most conspicuous of these kin groups. It is the principal land-holding unit, and it has various sacred associations, including some of a totemic nature. Patrilineal inheri? tance and affiliation with the father's matrilineal group are also important. Residence is patrilocal or patri-avunculocal in principle but complex and fluid in practice (Goodenough 1956a, Chowning 1958). Each of the 23 Lakalai villages is composed of one or more hamlets and grouped into a territory with neighboring communities (Goodenough 1962). Prior to contact with Europeans the territory was the widest unit of peaceful relations, and there was no institution of chieftainship (Chowning and Goodenough n.d.). With the imposi- tion of Australian administrative control, beginning in 1920, warfare was suppressed and official village headmen were appointed. From 1941 onward, cargo movements have forged a new kind of wider political unity which in recent years has expanded well beyond the limits of the Lakalai dialect area (Valentine 1959, 1960). Status and prestige are very largely matters of achievement in this society. There are no inherited offices of leadership or hereditary ranks. Many modes of achievement are open only to men, and most others are more accessible to men than to women. Accumulation and distribution of wealth in various forms, prowess in warfare, acquisi? tion of magical and ceremonial skills, and successful practice of the major crafts are the principal traditional avenues to achievement. Further indications of the superior position assigned to males are men's clubhouses with no corresponding institutions for women, a masked secret society, membership in which is an exclusively mascu? line privilege (Valentine 1961a), and the pre-eminent participation of men in the other major ritual activities (Goodenough 1955). In contemporary Lakalai life the management of new forms of wealth and the major new positions of leadership are all mainly or entirely in the hands of men. Traditional Lakalai religious belief is focused upon a complex conceptualization of diverse supernatural beings. Among the more important of these sacred entities are ghosts and ancestor spirits, anthropomorphic spirits of the bush, totemic monsters of many forms, and manlike deities (Valentine n.d.). With the coming of missionary Christianity, mainly after the First World War, and the emergence of cargo movements during the second global conflict,</page><page sequence="4">444 ETHNOLOGY two new religious systems have been added to Lakalai life. Little of the traditional religion has been transformed or replaced. Contem? porary Lakalai culture includes a synthetic tripartite religious complex composed of interrelated traditional, Christian, and cargo components (Valentine 1959, 1960). Lakalai Concepts of Personality The Lakalai describe and classify individuals in terms of many temperamental traits, which in turn refer to observable characteris? tics of behavior. Some of the categories which provide cultural resources for such classification are organized into a conceptual structure which has a discernible unity within the wider cognitive system of Lakalai culture. The system of personality classification to be examined here has the characteristics of a binary typology. The essentials of this ethnopsychological typology are indicated by two sets of descriptive phrases which are common constituents of Lakalai utterances. Each phrase has its equivalent in each of the two languages spoken most widely by the population: Lakalai and Melanesian Pidgin. The relevant phrases, together with English glosses, are presented in Table 1. It can be seen by inspection that each entry in Table 1 consists of a noun meaning "male human being" (Lakalai tahalo, Pidgin man, English "man") linked by a connecting construction (L. la, P. bilong, i-, E. "of") to a phrase or shorter segment which represents a psy? chological trait or behavioral characteristic. The nouns L. tavile, P. meri, E. "woman" can also be inserted in the same syntactic or semantic frames. Since the initial Lakalai and Pidgin nouns in these phrases are not limited in meaning by age, alternative glosses would be "man or boy," "woman or girl." TABLE 1 Lakalai Personality Typology Lakalai Pidgin English Type I 1. la-tahalo-la-igo totolo man bilong kros man of anger 2. la-tahalo-la-pigisususula man bilong ple man of play 3. la-tahalo-la-varelahula man bilong ron nabaui man of movement 4. la-tahalo-la-kabababubula man i-no stap gud long wanpela wok man of diffuse attention 5. la-tahalo-la-hutipela man bilong pushpush oltaim man of sexuality Type II 1. la-tahalo-la-mahela man bilong shem man of shame 2. la-tahalo-la-pouvarumula man bilong sidaun fasim manus man of silence 3. la-tahalo-la-pou tigila man bilong sidaun gud man of good conduct 4. la-tahalo-la-mari man bilong save man of knowledge 5. la-tahalo-la-gaumala man bilong piksaim samting man of art (Lakalai orthography as in Goodenough 1961; Pidgin orthography adapted from Hall 1955.)</page><page sequence="5">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 445 The three equivalent phrases numbered II describe individuals who become angry frequently, easily, or without appropriate cause. Such persons are quick to take offense, ready to participate in quarrels, and easily moved to physical violence. Common variants of the Lakalai and Pidgin phrases in this series reveal something more of their flavor. A final segment, L. bubula, P. nating, may be added to make more explicit the meaning "without cause," "meaninglessly," "aimlessly." In the phrases entered under 12 the operative forms, L. pigisu- susula, P. ple, refer to widely varied manifestations of playfulness, including various forms of humor, joking, teasing, impersonations, dramatizations, and games. The reference is to individuals who are fond of and adept at any or all such activities. While this cannot be said with certainty of the corresponding Lakalai form, the Pidgin ple has the additional meaning "sexual intercourse." The consistency of this meaning with phrase 15 is evident. A literal rendering of the Lakalai and Pidgin phrases designated 13 would be "a man who moves rapidly and often from place to place." These expressions refer to movements in space in a wide variety of contexts ranging from physical mobility within the daily routing to frequent shifts of domicile. The descriptions indicate a restless inability or unwillingness to remain for long in any single location. A close connection may be seen between these descriptions and those of the next entry in the table, 14. The latter can be rendered literally as "a man who does not (cannot) concentrate on a single activity (task)." These phrases refer to individuals who repeatedly and impulsively shift from one preoccupation to another and appear to be incapable of settling down to one thing for any length of time. A favorite example is the man who does not work steadily in the gardens. The implication is less one of laziness, however, than of diffuse or inconstant attention and interest. The expressions in the final entry under Type I contain the forms L. huti, "penis," and P. pushpush, "sexual intercourse." The individuals described in 15 are regarded as being highly sexed, greatly interested in sexual activities, and uninhibited in their expression of this interest. It is said that persons in this category may spend so much time and energy in intercourse that they become tired out, hollow-eyed, and even ill. The first set of phrases presented under Type II deals with the sense of shame, which is of great importance in Lakalai conceptions of emotion. The feeling of shame is described as a kind of acute embarrassment which is occasioned by public exposure, violation of modesty, recognition of deception, social exclusion, and certain other forms of interaction in which the subject feels threatened by the inappropriateness of his relations with others. The individuals described by the phrases numbered III are easily and often shamed, fearful of shaming, and likely to remain ashamed for a considerable</page><page sequence="6">446 ETHNOLOGY period once the emotion has been aroused. Their typical response to this feeling is one of embarrassed withdrawal and silent, passive avoidance of interaction. Shame is one of the major social sanctions. In the phrases listed under 112 and 113 the forms L. pou and P. sidaun require explication. When they occur as verbs, these forms mean "to sit" or "to be situated." In the nominal usage which occurs in the phrases considered here, some such literal rendering as "manner of being" becomes appropriate, and the full denotation in the present context can be expressed as "demeanor," "deportment," or "conduct." Thus the expressions of 112 have first the more specific meaning, "a man who sits silent." Their more general signiflcance can be repre? sented as "a man who is not talkative," "a man who conducts himself quietly." In their more extended senses, L. varumula and P. fasim maus refer to the general states or traits of silence and unrespon- siveness. Similarly, a literal English equivalent of the Lakalai and Pidgin expressions of 113 would be "a man with a good way of sitting down." In the vast majority of contexts which are relevant to our interests here, however, "man of good conduct" is a more appropriate render? ing. From one point of view, "man of propriety" would be a still more apposite gloss. As will be seen in greater detail below, the idea of "good conduct" which is expressed here evokes explicit approval and positive ethical valuation. The phrases of 114 denote "the man who knows," "the man who has knowledge." Both L. mari and P. save express "knowledge" in a broad sense which refers not only to "learning," but also to much that is included in "skill," "understanding," "inspiration," and "wisdom." Particularly relevant are various forms of traditional knowledge and skill, including a variety of crafts, magical skills, and mythological, cosmological, and ethnoscientific knowledge. Closely associated with the abilities and achievements involved here are those shown by the "man of art" (115). This denomination refers princi? pally to the individual who exhibits talent for decorative wood carving, painting, mask making, and feather work. The expressions set forth in Table 1 occur in everyday conversa? tion among the Lakalai, and the ideas to which they refer are not in any sense esoteric or limited in availability. Personal traits and psychological characteristics are common subjects of remark and commentary. There is thus ample opportunity for any normal member of Lakalai society to learn the concepts which are expressed by these phrases. Two or more of the descriptions 11-15 are frequently applied to a single individual, and a person will often be described by more than one of the phrases grouped together under II. Only infrequently are phrases from group I combined with descriptions from group II and applied to a particular person. When this does happen, it is usually accompanied by explicit or implicit indications that an inconsistency is perceived.</page><page sequence="7">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 447 The syntactic and semantic patterns presented thus far can be related to a set of beliefs expressed by informants. All the traits and qualities alluded to in group I are said to be of one kind, while those referred to in group II are described as being of another kind. The characteristics named in each group are believed to occur together in individuals. If one description from group I fits an individual, the other phrases in the group are generally presumed to apply as well. When one of the described characteristics within a group is lacking in a person, it is generally assumed that the other traits of this group will also be absent. The field research on which this account is based did not reveal any lexeme or other linguistic form which can be regarded as a class designation covering all the subclasses included in either of the types described. In a sense, because of the Lakalai assumptions of consis- tency within phrase groups and opposition between groups, any one phrase serves to imply the meanings represented by the other expres? sions in the same group. In terms of both observed usage and elicited informant testimony, "man of anger" (II) and "man of shame" (III) are in sharp, con- sciously recognized contrast. Much the same can be said of the phrase pairs which invoke "play" as opposed to "silence" (12 vs. 112) and "movement" as against "good conduct" (13 vs. 113). These are also the phrases most often used in the more generalizing sense, and as will be seen below there are important cultural and behavioral contrasts which are consistent with them. For the two remaining phrase pairs (14 and 114; 15 and 115), however, the data do not allow any such statement of one-to-one contrast, and the connotations of these expressions appear to be of narrow range. From this point of view it can be seen that the items in Table 1 are arranged in order of greater to less specific contrast and greater to less generality of connotation with respect to the whole typology. The evidence both of observation in situations not structured by the investigator and of systematic elicitation indicates that the Lakalai classify individuals in terms of this typology with a high degree of consistency. Such acts of classification are most often observed in utterances having the form L. eia, P. em i-, meaning "he (she) is," followed by one of the phrases given in Table 1. The phrases are used similarly with proper names and kinship terms, and they occur in numerous other syntactical frames as well. One of these additional frames is L. eia kama-, P. em i-no-, "he (she) is not-." Phrases 11-13 and II1-II3 occur most frequently in these contexts. Several or even all five of the phrases in each group may occur together in similar contexts. By far the majority of utterances observed or elicited agree in a number of important respects. There is little disagreement either between informants or between casual speakers as to the descriptions that are applicable to individuals who are well known to those speaking. This is true both in self-description or expressions of self-image and in classification of others. Though the data are less</page><page sequence="8">448 ETHNOLOGY full and satisfactory on this point, the application of any one phrase to an individual tends to be consistent, in terms of the system as described, with other phrases applied to the same individual whether by the same or by different speakers. The signiflcance of some of the relatively few disagreements which do occur will be explored below. The Typology and Observation Most instances of spontaneous or elicited descriptions placing individuals in terms of the typology referred to persons residing in three small neighboring communities with a total population of less than 250. As a result of living for two periods totaling considerably more than one year within this community complex, and interacting continuously with its personnel, it became possible to know virtually all its members reasonably well. Though there was, of course, some variation due to situational factors, all members of this population were observed with considerable frequency. Repeated personal interactions were experienced with the majority of these individuals, and considerable personal data were collected on most of them. Whenever individuals described themselves or were characterized by their fellows in terms of the ethnopsychological categories under dis? cussion, the description was compared with the investigator's knowl? edge of the individual in question. Most instances in which the investigator noted inconsistencies with his observations were also cases in which the Lakalai experienced some form of difficulty in applying their system. These instances were predominantly of three sorts. First, there is a minority of individuals about whom there is doubt or disagreement among informants and who seem to the observer to exhibit traits from both sides of the typological dichotomy. These individuals tend to be leading personalities who may combine, for example, a tendency to angry responses, verbal expressiveness, physical mobility, and uninhibited sexuality with care in observing customary proprieties, a high degree of concentrated attention, and achievement in certain traditional skills. Such individuals appear to manifest a highly adaptive constellation of traits some of which the Lakalai customarily assign to one type and some to the other. Second, there is another minority of individuals who appear to the investigator as relatively undifferentiated personalities in which few or none of the relevant traits are highly developed and there is little that is distinctive about the character. It is, of course, quite possible that these individuals may be more distinguishable in terms of other personality characteristics not included in the Lakalai typology and therefore given little attention by either informant or investigator. Thus even such relatively unsystematic observation as has been carried out so far suggests that some of the difnculties experienced by the Lakalai in applying their twofold classification may result from an actual distribution of traits which conforms more closely to a fourfold arrangement of presence and absence and of</page><page sequence="9">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 449 strength and weakness of traits, as is shown diagrammatically in Table 2. TABLE 2 Trait Distribution Suggested by Observation Type I traits present, well developed Type II traits absent or undeveloped Type I traits present, well developed Type II traits present, well developed Type I traits absent or undeveloped Type II traits present, well developed Type I traits absent or undeveloped Type II traits absent or undeveloped A third major source of difficulty in applying the typology was experienced by informant and investigator alike in the classification of females. In general, there was more doubt and greater disagreement in describing women and girls than in characterizing men or boys. Undoubtedly this is due in part to the circumstance that the investi? gator not only worked most often with male informants but also had more observational and other contacts with men than with women. In this situation it is fortunate that we can turn to the observa? tions of Chowning (1958), who worked closely with Lakalai women and found that in most respects the typology does apply to females. Thus, for example, Chowning (1958: 114) describes women who fall into our Type I in the following terms. They are "self-assertive, energetic, and possess a strong sense of humor. Relative freedom from shame, desire for interaction with others, and eagerness for self-display" also characterize these women. As is further noted in the same account, however, women are allowed significantly fewer opportunities for self-expression than men. In part this is a matter of greater pressure on females to conform to a single ideal largely represented by traits which belong to Type II. It is also related to the male solidarity and male dominance mentioned above. The result seems to be that, on the whole, women develop somewhat less overt individuality and psychological distinctiveness than do men as far as the traits under consideration here are concerned. The Types in Their Cultural Context Lakalai ethnopsychology conceptualizes and highlights a number of psychological characteristics which are functional and adaptive within the existing social and cultural order. Each of the traits or behavioral tendencies which are denominated has a recognizable place in the cultural system. Each is allowed scope for expression through traditional roles within the social structure. Each may be rewarded in a manner consistent with the value structure. Aggressiveness and violent temper are hallmarks of leadership. In former times courage and prowess in war were among the most important qualifications for the roles of highest prestige. Today the organizational ability needed to accumulate wealth, to handle social situations successfully, and to achieve positions of political leadership</page><page sequence="10">450 ETHNOLOGY still depends in large measure on a forceful and aggressive approach to interpersonal relations. Among the more minor but nevertheless valued and respected activities at which the "man of anger" often excels is hunting. Althouth similar temperamental traits cannot give to women the same degree of prestige which they may confer upon men, they are respected in senior women especially. While excessive displays of the traits of the "man of anger" may be disapproved, anyone who earns this characterization commands respect. The leading status of "big man" (tahalo uru) or "community magnate" (Chowning and Goodenough n.d.: 71-80) is attained only by those who possess a generous endowment of these personal qualities. The talents and inclinations subsumed under the rubric "man of play" are expressed in the many lighter and more entertaining sides of Lakalai life. In addition to organized games, dramatic presenta? tions, and singing and dancing chiefly for purposes of entertainment, there are also many outlets for informal joking and clowning. More or less elaborate teasing is a major mode of dealing with various kinds of interpersonal tension. In groups of women, impersonations which mock and lampoon the males of the community provoke paroxysms of hilarity. This is but one of many contexts in which women use the weapon of ridicule to redress somewhat the balance of dominance in sex roles. The restlessness and mobility of the "man of movement" have important social functions and may vouchsafe significant rewards to the individual. In a society with few formal structures of political unity and no modern forms of communication, the individual who is constantly traveling and visiting from one community to another counterbalances the tendency to social atomism. As he moves about, he repeatedly reactivates kinship connections and other social ties, and he keeps the channels of communication open between communi? ties. A customary resolution of serious quarrels is for one party to shift his residence to another community, and "men of anger" may make many such moves in a lifetime. A visitor can generally count on hospitality and support wherever he has kinsmen. For the leaders of modern religious and political movements, among whose aims is the forging of wider social unity, the willingness and ability to move frequently from place to place is essential. The related inability to concentrate or maintain interest in a single activity, also associated with the other traits of Type I, is seldom accorded overt or explicit approval. Nevertheless, the society does provide a place for people with these characteristics and does not penalize them severely, particularly in the case of men. The inconstant husband need fear little unless his affairs become known in such a way as to produce intergroup conflict, and even then he will be supported by his sibmates. The man who does not work steadily can subsist by utilizing the obligations imposed by kinship ties. Some men, particularly bachelors and widowers, live for long periods by attaching themselves more or less dependently to one group of relatives after another.</page><page sequence="11">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 451 The Lakalai expect everyone, including children, to be interested in sex, but they recognize great differences in the strength and expression of this interest. Aside from the incest taboo, restrictions on intercourse are few, and most of them may be evaded through secrecy. Men treat sexual prowess as a manly virtue. Physical attractiveness and sexual willingness are valued in women, provided they do not lead to conflict through exposure of illicit affairs. At the same time, how? ever, excessive indulgence is said to produce weakness or illness. More important, recent intercourse is believed to prevent the successful working of any magic performed by men. Female genital blood is regarded as generally dangerous to males. The belief that physical aggressiveness is closely associated with sexuality, together with the fact that violence is a recognized prelude or accompaniment of intercourse in various situations, constitutes another link among the traits associated under Type I. The recent introduction of European ideas concerning the sinfulness of sexuality, mediated chiefly by the mission churches but now also connected with the cargo ideology, has further complicated Lakalai ambivalence toward sex. The feeling of shame is another emotional reaction which it is assumed anyone will exhibit in some situations, but again degrees of vulnerability and ways of dealing with the feeling are believed to differ greatly. The intensity of this emotion may be gauged from the fact that typical responses by sensitive individuals to highly shaming situations, pre-eminently anal exposure for males, are suicide and voluntary exile from the society. In less vulnerable men, on the other hand, feelings of shame do not last long and are quickly replaced by hostility and aggression. This difference is reflected in the sharp contrast between the "man of shame" and the "man of anger." Nevertheless, fear of being involved in, caught at, reproved for, or ridiculed as a result of inappropriate interpersonal behavior provides a powerful motivation for proper conduct in everyone. Women are believed to be generally less easily shamed than men, and the power of a woman to make a man ashamed is probably the greatest single masculine vulnerability. Persons of inferior or junior status are particularly vulnerable to shame in the presence of superiors or seniors. All the various kinds of unresponsiveness, reluctance to interact, and slowness or paucity of speech which characterize the "man of silence" are most often interpreted as due to either a general vulnera? bility to shame or a particular shaming experience. These responses are further associated with obedience, willingness to follow instruc? tions or grant requests, and respectful behavior in general. Along with avoidance of conflict and certain of the quieter virtues such as steady industriousness and dependability, these qualities constitute what was earlier designated as "good conduct" or "propriety." These are the traits which receive the most hearty expressions of explicit and general approval. Although, as we have seen, rich rewards may also be gained especially by men through noisily and ambitiously disregarding many of these virtues, the individual distinguished by "proper conduct" is always accorded respect. While the potential</page><page sequence="12">452 ETHNOLOGY rewards of less proper behavior are perhaps more attractive to some men at least, the risks entailed are also greater. The men of knowledge and the artists are the experts and specialists upon whom the community depends heavily for many important services ranging from specialized subsistence activities to the performance of magic or rendering of judgments on large questions affecting the welfare of the society. Those who play the more impor? tant of these roles, which are far more open to men than to women, are honored by all and sometimes, as in the case of sorcerers, generally feared as well. The pre-eminent status of "big man" cannot be achieved without a considerable reputation in at least some of these fields of activity. It seems clear from the foregoing that Lakalai society does not exert heavy pressure upon the individual to conform to a single, restricted psychological ideal. This is a social system within which a considerable variety of personalities can exist in relative freedom and with significant satisfactions. The most favored individuals are those who combine the adaptive strengths of major traits from both of the types conceptualized in the ethnopsychological system. Indeed, it seems likely that individuals with such a combination of characteris? tics would flourish in many different social settings. The relatively larger categories of people whose traits, in Lakalai theory at any rate, place them more or less definitely within one type also have definite parts to play and functions to fulfill. It appears that the behavioral constellations associated with each side of the dichotomy have com- plementary social functions. Although broader comparative considerations will be deferred until later sections, it is appropriate to note at this point some sugges- tive resemblances between the Lakalai temperament types and the conceptions of personal character described by Read among the Gahuku-Gama of the New Guinea Highlands. According to Read (1959: 433), the Gahuku "sterotype of the 'strong' man may be described as a person who is both assertive and aggressive. He is pre-eminently a warrior, a man who is quick to take offense, to suspect a slight or injury, and likely to resort to force. He is a 'hard' man, a proud man, an individual who is not likely to defer to others, a person who tends to act precipitately. He expects obedience, is motivated by a desire to dominate and cannot abide opposition. He is an individual who easily feels threatened by the quality of 'strength' in others." On the other hand, the Gahuku "sterotype of the 'weak' man might be described as a person who is non-assertive and non-aggres- sive. He is, on the whole, content to let others lead. He eschews the limelight, is reluctant to wrangle, evidences no desire to dominate others, and has a completely undistinguished record in the typically male activities." However, it is neither of these extreme personalities which gains the greatest prestige or success in leadership among the Gahuku but rather an intermediate type which Read, borrowing a term from Riesman (1950), describes as the "autonomous" man.</page><page sequence="13">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 453 While summarizing the "autonomous" character as intermediate between, or combining traits from, the stereotypical extremes does not do full justice to Read's delineation of leading personal charac? teristics among the Gahuku, limitations of space forbid further ex- ploration of this insightful portrayal here. Read (1959: 434) suggests that "there is a high degree of prob? ability" that his formulation of Gahuku character types and their relationship to authority "is applicable to many other New Guinea societies." The obvious resemblances between the "strong man" and the Lakalai "man of anger," the "weak man" and the Lakalai "man of shame," the "autonomous" individual and what I have called intermediate or balanced temperaments among the Lakalai, give support to this suggestion. The Typology and the Life Cycle Lakalai ethnopsychology includes an assumption that the individual's traits and his conformity to a type generally remain stable over long periods of time. Nevertheless, certain changes are recognized during the life cycle, and some traits in particular are regarded as more appropriate to one stage than another. Relative age and maturation are matters of considerable interest and concern. The growth of children is desired and encouraged in various ways. Numerous phases in each individual's life history are marked by rites of passage. A person's age is regularly taken into account in evaluating his behavior. Seniority is a prerequisite for achievement of all higher statuses, and a certain degree of prestige is accorded automatically with advancing age. As far as infants are concerned, individuality is little recognized in terms of the traits under consideration here. The appearance of some of these traits is remarked in young children, however. By the time a child is both walking and talking, definite instruction is begun to inculcate the Type II virtues of "shame," "silence," and "proper conduct." The ideal pre-adolescent would combine these marks of good behavior with obedience, respect for elders, and industriousness. Few children were observed who consistently realized this ideal. Opposing traits are also noted at this age, and in spite of the general value bias in child rearing, fathers widely regarded as exemplifying Type I will sometimes boast of their children's aggressiveness or mobility. Playfulness and inattention are recognized as character? istic traits of childhood. It is during adolescence, youth, and early maturity, however, that the chief characteristics of Type I are expected to have their greatest flowering. It is generally assumed that all the Type I traits will be relatively strong during this middle time of life, regardless of the over-all placement of the individual in the typology. In par? ticular, this is the period of greatest interest in sexual activity. The other traits are said to be related to this through quarrels over sexual partners, teasing and joking over sex matters, roving about in search</page><page sequence="14">454 ETHNOLOGY of partners, inattention to other matters owing to preoccupation with sex, and the like. It is consistent with all this that traditionally an individual was not considered fully mature until he or she had passed through the phase just described. In fact, only with the attainment of grand- parenthood was maturity considered secure and seniority fully granted. By this time many of the achievements and satisfactions available through the exercise of Type I traits could already have been attained. According to Lakalai conceptions, certain of these rewards, especially those of sexuality, should by this time be less desirable. It is also not until this later age that the largest number of skills has been accumulated and the most specialized or esoteric knowledge acquired. Hence this becomes the time of life when many of the Type II virtues come into their greatest play. Those individ? uals who have made the most of their opportunities for achievement in other directions at earlier stages are then in a position to attain the most respected and powerful positions of the society. Thus the pre- eminent rewards granted to those who exhibit a combination of traits from both sides of the typology are manifest once more. It is a common Lakalai opinion that Type I fathers are often strict disciplinarians and therefore tend to have young children who display Type II virtues, while for parallel reasons the offspring of more permissive parents are sometimes less controlled. Nothing is known which would indicate that this is regarded as a full and regular reversal of traits from one generation to another, or that any such reversal is believed to persist from childhood to adulthood. When the personality descriptions applied to individuals are viewed in the light of genealogical data, it appears that there is a tendency for individuals placed in opposite types to marry. Our information does not include enough descriptions of individuals with mature offspring to draw meaningful conclusions as to any relation? ship between the type assignments of parents and children. Cases of doubtful paternity sometimes occasion speculation about physical resemblances between parents and offspring. However, we have no indication of a Lakalai theory that personality characteristics are inherited or that temperamental traits are related to bodily form. The Typology and Social Change The ethnopsychological system is related to recent changes in Lakalai society and culture in a number of definable ways. In the first place, the Lakalai believe that in the course of these changes Type I people are becoming more numerous and important while individuals of Type II are disappearing with the old men. This belief is related to the association of Type II traits with the old-fashioned virtues, skills, and knowledge of traditional seniority. Certain ele? ments of this pattern do indeed appear to be succumbing to pressure from both external and, to a lesser extent, internal agents of change.</page><page sequence="15">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 455 This native view of the psychological implications of change gains plausibility from the fact that in most situations the aggressive, mobile men of Type I are best equipped temperamentally to learn the ways of the wider colonial society and to deal with Europeans. In particular, their relative ability to overcome shame is important here, for native-European interactions are potentially most shame- invoking by their very nature. Since many younger men have neg? lected parts of their traditional heritage in the process of acquiring newer techniques and knowledge, success in the modern world is beginning to undermine the older forms of seniority, and the asso? ciated traits of character are gaining increased importance relative to the old-fashioned virtues. European authorities, both secular and religious, have system- atically opposed some activities associated with Type I traits and effectively prohibited some expressions of these traits. For example, warfare has been completely eliminated, polygyny greatly reduced in frequency, and sexuality exposed to a new kind of moral op- probrium. The same authorities have also sought, with greater or lesser success, to promote, perpetuate, or extend to new situations certain tendencies which are more associated with Type II. Among the more consistent of these efforts are attempts to enlist native con? cepts and motives of obedience in the service of demands for com? pliance with European requirements, or to extend existing notions of proper conduct to include European virtues. More complex and productive of confusion is the pattern of behavior followed by not a few administrators and missionaries who systematically exploit the Lakalai vulnerability to shame for their own purposes, even though they also repeatedly criticize this native "weakness" and give the impression that Europeans suffer from no corresponding liability. Out of the situation of early intercultural contact in which these developments began have grown the more recent Lakalai movements for culture change focused in large part on local variants of the cargo ideology. These movements have had a developing mythological charter that portrays a future millennium in which the achievement of European standards is equated with the return of a native golden age of the past. Within this context, warfare, violent quarrels, aggres? sive magic (particularly sorcery and love charms), and illicit sexuality, together with shame, are all among the elements believed to have been absent during the ideal past. These same items, it is predicted, will disappear once more with the coming of the cargo millennium. Meanwhile each of these cultural or psychological elements is officially disapproved and ostensibly banned by the movement organization. Thus a deliberate and organized attempt to produce culture change is bringing about certain shifts in the values attached to psy? chological traits and types which the Lakalai conceive. Except in pious oratory on some occasions or in efforts to impress outsiders of authority, there is as yet little disposition to claim that the occur- rence of traits or their behavioral manifestations has actually been</page><page sequence="16">456 ETHNOLOGY significantly modified by these efforts at change. Indeed, many Lakalai are much troubled by their failure so far to effect such innova- tions. Some actual progress in the direction of these goals is generally believed to be a precondition for the materialization of the millennium with all its other marvelous and coveted elements. Each time the great day is prophesied but does not come to pass, the disappointing outcome is explained and understood partly in terms of this human failure. To the external observer it appears that traits and talents from both sides of the ethnopsychological dichotomy have a functional relationship to these movements for change. Despite the devaluing of some elements from traditional lore, the mythologists and ideolo- gists who create the charters and belief systems of these movements are the contemporary counterparts of the older "men of knowledge." Judging by a number of known individuals who play this role, they appear to share at least some of the other traits which make up the Lakalai concept of Type II. Movement doctrine gives no overt approval to most of the per? sonal qualities associated with Type I. Yet extensive contact with practically all the men of action who hold offices of leadership in the existing movement organization gives the decided impression that most of them would be classified as belonging to this type. In the minority of cases for which informants' descriptions have been re? corded, this impression is generally confirmed. The chief exceptions are a few of the most successful movement leaders who exhibit a combination of outstanding adaptive characteristics from both sides of the typology. It thus appears that the contemporary changing social system still has places and functions for varied psychological elements, much as did the traditional society. The Typology Rephrased and Summarized The discussion up to this point has been guided by the intention to present a meaningful part of the Lakalai sociocultural system in its own terms. That is, an attempt has been made, so far as possible, to employ only structural units and conceptual distinctions which either appear as part of the Lakalai cognitive system itself or reflect directly the apparently inherent order of the observational data. In other words, the preceding sections constitute what Pike and French would call the "emic" portion of the analysis. In the present section the transition is made to an "etic" ap? proach. This will be done in the following summary of the informa? tion which has been presented on the Lakalai personality typology. The summary seeks to rephrase the content of the typology by in- voking familiar categories and distinctions from Western thought. Nevertheless, this restatement is drawn with care to avoid imposing units, distinctions, variables, or dimensions of variation which are not demonstrably consonant with the data which have been presented earlier. An attempt is thus made to translate the rather concrete and</page><page sequence="17">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 457 restricted terms of the Lakalai typology into a more abstract and comprehensive classification. An aim of this translation is to make explicit some of the major implications of the Lakalai classificatory phraseology which are legitimate in terms of Lakalai culture, but it is intended that other implications which are irrelevant to or inconsist? ent with this culture should remain excluded. The summary below therefore outlines the manifest and implicit content of the Lakalai categories in descriptive phrases, four for each type, which are made up largely of terms that have not been employed in the discussion up to this point. Each descriptive phrase is then followed by a list of relevant elements from the data which is de? signed to indicate the bases for the labeling phrase. Type I Active, aggressive, animated. Energetic, self-assertive, spatially and socially mobile, playful, disciplinarian, proficient at warfare, hunting, and athletic games. Expressive, impulsive, explosive. Angry, quarrelsome, humorous, teasing, talkative, self-displaying, violent, sexually active, unashamed, proficient at oratory, dramatization, and dancing. Extensive, shifting consciousness. Diffuse awareness, inconstant attention, unsteady application, restlessness, broad shallow interests. Oriented outward toward human and other objects. Much inter? personal contact, communication, emotional interaction, group activity, sexual interaction, organizational leadership, accumulation and manipulation of material wealth, involvement in practical affairs. Type II Passive, quiescent, subdued. Physically inactive, quiet, self- effacing, spatially and socially settled, grave or solemn, permissive, proficient at sedentary, non-motor, and intellectual pursuits. Inhibited, deliberative, controlled. Silent, unresponsive, taciturn, peaceful, serious, sexually inactive, obedient, respectful, modest, proper, sensitive, easily shamed. Intensive, concentrated consciousness. Focused awareness, con? sistent attention, industriousness, dependability, learning, skill, nar- row deep interests. Oriented away from objects, inward toward the self. Frequent with? drawal from interpersonal contact, uncommunicativeness, reserve, avoidance of groups, solitary activity, sexual reticence, preoccupation with thought, concepts, ideas, and beliefs. Western Personality Classification s Western cultural traditions include a conception of individual variability which appears to be old, widespread, and persistent. In popular form this is the familiar notion of the man of action, practical man, realist, or sociable person as opposed to the thinker, dreamer, idealist, or shy individual. The most widely used labels associated with this tradition are the type designations extravert and introvert.</page><page sequence="18">458 ETHNOLOGY Clearly there is at least a superficial resemblance between this system of categories and that of Lakalai ethnopsychology. Limitations of space forbid a detailed presentation of this Western typological tradition. Surveys are available in the psycho? logical literature (e.g., Freyd 1924, Guilford and Braly 1930, Eysenck 1947). We must skip over such probable early sources as the habitus apoplecticus and phthisicus of Hippocrates and Galen (Anastasi and Foley 1949: 422), as well as more recent acknowledged precursors like the poet Schiller, with his division between realistic and idealistic characters, or the philosopher Nietzsche with his conception of Dionysian and Apollonian styles of life (Jung 1946: 87-183). The wide influence of kindred dichotomies in modern scholarly and scientific thought can be glimpsed by inspecting the selected sample of typologies from the psychology of the past 75 years set forth in Table 3. These examples reflect the fact that the Western classificatory tradition has been applied not only to temperament and normal behavior styles but also to psychopathology and constitutional types. The pervasiveness of the basic dichotomy in Western thought is illustrated by the presence here of such diverse approaches as the early modern philosophical psychology of James, the Kraepelian nosology which is basic to modern psychiatry, Binet's pioneering studies of differential psychology and intelligence, Watsonian be- haviorism, neurological investigations such as those of Kempf, Jungian analytic psychology, other analytical orientations such as that of Ferenczi, projective testing represented by Rorschach, Henry Murray's personology, the studies of conditioned reflexes by Pavlov, experimental investigations using factor analysis by Cattell and others, and the perceptual-attitudinal studies of Schactel, to mention but a few. Several other major contributors to contemporary psy? chology have made notable use of the same system of ideas without employing new labels (e.g., Murphy 1947: 594-619, Eysenck 1947 et sqq.). Work in other fields of social science has also produced some suggestively similar conceptions, such as the "inner-directed" and "other-directed" character types developed by Riesman (1950). It is not to be argued here that all the typologies cited represent identical ideas. Each conception of types should be viewed in its own particular theoretical context, which, however, cannot be reviewed here. Nevertheless, there can be little doubt that these classifications are linked together by a number of central themes, the development of which can be traced through the history of psychology. This has been repeatedly and explicitly recognized both by contributors to this body of thought (e.g., James 1907, Jung 1921, Eysenck 1947) and by reviewers of the resulting literature (e.g., Anastasi and Foley 1949, Freyd 1924, Guilford and Brady 1930, Hall and Lindzey 1957). The general orientation reviewed so briefly here has undoubtedly gained its greatest fame directly or indirectly from the writings of Jung (1921 et sqq.). In recent years the work of Cattell (1956, 1957) and Eysenck (1947 et sqq.) has placed investigation in the field on a new footing. In particular, the large-scale research program of</page><page sequence="19">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 459 Eysenck and his co-workers has employed a systematic integration of clinical and experimental approaches. Among the principal results which have come from the work of Eysenck and his collaborators is the conclusion that extraversion- introversion is a major operationally definable, objectively measurable dimension of human personality. Along with this has come explicit recognition and confirmation of a point which is implicit in many of the writings reviewed here: That extraversion and introversion represent bipolar extremes on a continuum rather than mutually ex? clusive "pure" types. In this special sense, Eysenck regards his work as confirming the essentials of the Jungian typology. While the work of Eysenck and his collaborators has received its share of negative criticism, the aspects of this work which are relevant here have also been cited approvingly by qualified reviewers and commentators (e.g., Hall and Lindzey 1957: 381-393, David and von Bracken 1961: 76-84).

These characterizations were generally informal or speculative assign- ments of traits and types to European nationalities or to such gener- alized categories as Orientals. An early attempt was made to as- sociate temperamental types with blood groups (Furukawa 1927). There is much in the work of Jung (e.g., 1959: 26ff., 289ff.) which links it with classical evolutionary approaches in comparative or developmental psychology through the assumption of a "correspond? ence between ontogenesis and phylogenesis." Although these passages contain apparent implications of an association between primitivism and introversion, Jung does not seem to have related the temperament typology explicitly to his developmental ideas. In this connection it can also be noted that Jung (1931: xvi), in the course of endorsing the conclusions of one of his students (Aldrich 1931), once explicitly re? jected Levy-Bruhl's distinction between primitive and civilized men? tal functioning. One Jungian scholar carried out ethnographic field work in Melanesia, but his use of the temperament types is quite incidental (Layard 1942: 648). Intersocietal variations in the Rorschach experience type (extra- tensive vs. introversive) have been suggested from the time of Rorschach himself (1921) to recent studies (e.g., Opler and Singer 1956). In some cross-cultural Rorschach studies, the experience types of non-Western peoples have been described in more or less detail (e.g., Hallowell 1941, 1942; Oberholzer 1944; Wallace 1952), but little theoretical use has been made of these results in terms of the typological approaches discussed here. The work of Eysenck cited earlier, together with a renewed interest in the experience type among some projective psychologists (e.g., Singer 1960), may raise new possibilities here for the future. Two major figures in American anthropology showed an early awareness of the typological approach in critical reviews of Jung's work (Kroeber 1918, Sapir 1923). Each of these men also followed up his initial interest in a small way by briefly characterizing various European and non-Western peoples as relatively extraverted or intro- verted (Sapir 1933, Kroeber 1948: 583-584). Although the interest of these and other commentators aroused some discussion of Jung's ideas among American anthropologists in the 1920s (Mead 1959: 207), no systematic research seems to have resulted from this stimulus. The majority of anthropological studies dealing with personality variables have employed dynamic models derived from Freudian theory rather than typological formulations. Nevertheless, the few typological approaches which have been made in anthropology amount to a paradigm of the logical possibilities for applying such a bipolar classification to comparative or cross-cultural materials.</page><page sequence="21">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 461 Assuming that the purpose is to compare personality factors in non- literate societies with our own, there are four such possibilities: (1) that nonliterate peoples are typically extraverted; (2) that primitive groups tend generally to be introverted; (3) that some societies, whether simple or complex, are predominantly of one temperamental type, while others in either cultural category show a predominance of the opposite temperament type; and (4) that both psychological types occur with significant frequency in many or all societies whether primitive or not. The first of these positions was taken by C. G. Seligman in an early paper (1924) on points of contact between anthropology and psychology in which the Jungian typology is explicitly applied to the comparative materials of ethnology. Seligman (1924: 26) sums up his principal point with the statement: "It is, indeed, fairly obvious directly the ideas of introversion and extra version have been explored, that the savage would, from our standpoint, belong to the extravert type." An important part of Seligman's argument is the assertion that primitive peoples are particularly prone to suggestion and hysterical responses. This reflects the Jungian formulation of an association between extraversion on the one hand and suggestibility and hysteria on the other, an association which has been confirmed in part by Eysenck (1947). The groups which Seligman specifically identifies as extraverted include the nonliterate peoples of Melanesia, Negro Africa, Ceylon, Siberia, and the Arctic. While he assigns an extraverted tempera? ment to "savages" in general, he also explores the possibility that some primitive societies give greater scope to the development of extraversion than others, comparing illustrative peoples of both Africa and Melanesia in this connection. Seligman's characterization of Melanesians as extraverts reappears in a later article (1929) based on data from that area, and he again commends the work of Jung to anthropologists in a subsequent address (1932). Shortly after Seligman's first published presentation of his thesis, Pitt-Rivers (1927: 148-154) elaborated further upon it in discussing the psychological dimensions of culture contact. Pitt-Rivers classifies Africans, American Negroes, Australian aborigines, and Melanesians as especially extraverted peoples. He goes somewhat beyond Selig? man's stated position in "recognizing the extrovert as the more gen? eralized, less differentiated and, in a developmental or evolutionary sense, the more infantile and primitive adaptive attitude" (Pitt- Rivers 1927:153). Both racialist and eugenicist ideas are clearly asso? ciated with this attempt "to establish the psychological counterpart of a racial type" by Pitt-Rivers (1927: 5). He refers to the work of both Jung and Seligman. During the same decade when Seligman and Pitt-Rivers were advancing their suggestions, the essentially opposite second position was taken by the psychoanalist-anthropologist Geza Roheim (1925). Although Roheim later (1950: 1) described himself as an orthodox Freudian, the conceptions which he employed in this connection were</page><page sequence="22">462 ETHNOLOGY borrowed from the Freudian revisionist Ferenczi, whose formulation of the alloplastic-autoplastic dichotomy has been noted as a contribu? tion to the typological tradition (Table 3). While Ferenczi (1938, originally 1923) first proposed this distinction in a rather specialized theoretical framework, it has wider implications for general styles of psychological adaptation, as stated by a more recent psychoanalytic authority (Rado 1959: 327): "The organism seeks to fit its needs to its environment, and its environment to its needs. The first process is called autoplastic adaptation; the second alloplastic adaptation." Thus the inward turning orientation of autoplastic responses corres- ponds to introversion, while the external orientation of alloplastic manipulation parallels extraversion. Roheim's argument grows out of his study of Australian aboriginal society, but on the basis of evolutionary assumptions com? mon in much psychoanalytic thinking his thesis is applied by exten? sion to other primitive peoples as well. Roheim (1925: 221-222) con- cludes that "the Australian native has conserved the rudiments of a pre-human stage of development; his culture is autoplastic," and "it is very natural that this poverty of external resources should go hand in hand with a corresponding autoerotic fixation of the libido." This interpretation has been revived and further generalized by the psychiatrist Bruno Bettelheim in the course of presenting a neo- Freudian theory of initiation rites. Bettelheim (1955: 139) treats the development from simpler to more complex forms of society and cul? ture as an evolution from "autoplastic manipulation" to "alloplastic manipulation of the external world." He concludes (1955: 98-99) that a major reason why "preliterate peoples" continue to have small and simple societies is that "their egos" are not "well adapted to meet and change external reality," and they have a "tendency to try to solve problems by autoplastic rather than alloplastic means." The third typological position may be found in the work of Ruth Benedict (1930, 1932, 1934). The principal types which she elabo? rated were drawn from the Nietzchean conceptions of Dionysian and Apollonian character which Jung recognized as an earlier formulation corresponding closely to his own concepts. Benedict's work is quite opposed to the two positions just described, for she presents a spirited refutation of all theses that nonliterate peoples in general can be assigned to any one psychological type. It has recently been made clear by Margaret Mead (1959: 206-207, 305) that Benedict was aware not only of Jung's work but of the interest shown in it by Sapir and Seligman as well as by Radin, whose position will be reviewed below. Mead also makes it apparent that Benedict had little sym- pathy with the Jungian approach as such. Along with all this, however, goes Benedict's consistent theme that cultures are so patterned that the members of cultural groups do conform to particular personality configurations. Bearing in mind that she did not accept the limitation of possibilities to any two types, her view as it emerges from these considerations can be fairly restated as follows in terms of the interests of this essay. Her position appears</page><page sequence="23">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 463 to have been that, while each society is likely to exhibit a single typi? cal temperamental pattern, different nonliterate groups show different configurations, and the two principal types which she identified are derived from the typological tradition which has been described above. This corresponds to the contention that some primitive peoples are introverted, others extraverted. The fourth viewpoint which is relevant to the present discussion is expressed in the work of Paul Radin. It has been noted by a number of scholars that Radin was more influenced by the Jungian school of thought than any other major American anthropologist (Progoff 1953: 274-278, Hallowell 1954: 208-209, Mead 1959: 305). Radin argued in print more than once that Jungian theory is of great importance for anthropology (1929: 26-33, 1932:16). As has been pointed out by Hallowell (1954), however, Radin's acceptance of ideas which came from Jung was by no means unqualified. Indeed, a major portion of Radin's work?particularly in his two best known books (1927, 1953)?was devoted to opposing concepts of primitive mentality which he found in the writings of Levy-Bruhl, of Jung, and of other analytical theorists including Freud and Roheim. In place of the psychoanalytic position Radin (1927, edition of 1957: 230-232) set forth his own view that in all primitive societies, "as among us, there exist, roughly speaking, two general types of tem- perament: the man of action and the thinker. . . . The man of action, broadly characterized, is oriented toward the object, interested pri? marily in practical results, and indifferent to the claims and stirrings of his inner self. . . . The thinker, on the other hand . . . is impelled by his whole nature to spend a considerable time in analyzing his sub? jective states and attaches great importance both to their influence upon his actions and to the explanations he has developed." This statement is precisely parallel to the position that both introverts and extraverts occur with significant frequency in Western and nonliterate societies alike. Radin does not seem to have indicated explicitly anywhere that he had a Jungian model in mind when he developed this bipolar con? ception of types. Nevertheless, it is obvious that these temperament categories come directly from the same typological tradition which has been referred to repeatedly in these pages. In fact, the type names which Radin has chosen are those which are probably most often associated with the common-sense, popular version of the traditional dichotomy. Attention has been newly directed to Radin's ideas and their influence by the recent publication of a Festschrift in his honor (Diamond 1960). It is noteworthy that in the essays brought together in this volume Radin's position on the problem which concerns us here is found to have contemporary relevance to a wide variety of problems including comparative metaphysics (Campbell 1960), the develop? ment of religion (Bidney 1960), and psychopathological primitivity (Goldstein 1960), as well as the general topic of nonliterate thought (Redfield 1960).</page><page sequence="24">464 ETHNOLOGY The Lakalai and Western Classifications Compared Many similarities and parallels between the Western typologies and that of the Lakalai have appeared in the preceding pages without being made explicit. Some of the more important of these resem- blances can now be set forth systematically. A general comparison of the Lakalai system with each of 26 sample typologies from the Western tradition is presented in Table 4. In this tabulation, the categories abstracted from the Lakalai system are represented in the first column by the labels given to them in the earlier summary of the Lakalai typology. To these are added parenthetically the English glosses for Lakalai trait designations presented in Table 1. The corresponding Western typologies which emphasize each particular aspect of the Lakalai system are ranged in the second column opposite the appropriate parts of the Lakalai trait inventory. TABLE 4 Lakalai and Western Typologies Compared Content of Lakalai Categories Western Systems of Classifications Active, aggressive, animated vs. Passive, quiescent, subdued (Anger, play, movement, sexuality vs. sEame, silence, good conduct) Active vs. reflective (Jordan) Active vs. passive (Furukawa) Aggressive vs. repressive (Burt) Sthenic vs. asthenic (Burt) Somatotonic vs. cerebrotonic (Sheldon) Expressive, impulsive, explosive vs. Inhibited, deliberative, controlled (Anger, play, movement, sexuality vs. shame, silence, good conduct) Explosive vs. obstructed (James) Romantic vs. classic (Ostwald) Impulsive vs. deliberative (Watson) Erethitic vs. kolytic (Hunt) Surgent vs. desurgent (Cattell) Extensive, shifting consciousness vs. Intensive, concentrated consciousness (Movement, diffuse attention vs. good conduct, knowledge, art) Extensive vs. intensive (Gross) Shallow-broad vs. deep-narrow (Gross) Oriented outward toward the object vs. Oriented inward toward the self (Anger, play, sexuality vs. shame, silence, knowledge, art) Objective vs. subjective (Binet) Empiricist vs. rationalist (James) Practical vs. theoretical (James) Tough-minded vs. tender-minded (James) Allopsychic vs. autopsychic (Wernicke) Extraverted vs. introverted (Jung) Extratensive vs. introversive (Rorschach) Syntropic vs. idiotropic (Wertheimer) Adient vs. avoidant (Holt) Extraceptive vs. introceptive (Murray) Exocathected vs. endocathected (Murray) Alloplastic vs. autoplastic (Ferenczi) Projective vs. introjective (Degan) Allocentric vs. autocentric (Schachtel) The central position of the Jungian conceptualization among these various classificatory devices is enough to justify a somewhat closer comparison between it and Lakalai ideas. Jung (1959: 248)</page><page sequence="25">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 465 summed up the nature of extraversion in the following definition: "Extraversion means an outward turning of the libido. With this concept I denote a manifest relatedness of subject to object in the sense of a positive movement of subjective interest towards the object. Everyone in the state of extraversion thinks, feels, and acts in relation to the object, and moreover in a direct and clearly observ- able fashion, so that no doubt can exist about his positive dependence upon the object." This is a highly abstract characterization in com? parison with the rather concrete Lakalai descriptions. Yet it is clear enough that this abstraction includes the active and expressive Lakalai of Type I, constantly interacting with the human and other objects of his environment angrily, playfully, through speech, through sex, or in group activities, and seldom isolated from his fellows be? cause of shame or otherwise. The general attitude of the introvert is summarized formally in another of Jung's definitions (1959: 262): "Introversion means a turning inward of the libido whereby a negative relation of subject to object is expressed. Interest does not move towards the object, but recedes towards the subject. Everyone whose attitude is introverted thinks, feels, and acts in a way that clearly demonstrates that the subject is the chief factor of motivation, while the object at most receives only a secondary value." Here we have no difficulty in recog- nizing the Lakalai Type II "man of shame" with his avoidance of interpersonal contact, his sexual and emotional inhibitions, relatively unresponsive and uncommunicative but much involved in solitary intellectual and artistic activities. The work of J. R. Hunt (1928) represents a rather different branch of the Western typological tradition. Acknowledging his close conceptual ties with Pavlov and only a more distant kinship with Jordan, Jung, and Kretschmer, he suggested a binary typology based on concepts of neurological functions. His type names are coined from Greek roots which refer to neural excitation (erethitic) and inhibition (kolytic). His descriptions (1928: 179) are worthy of fairly extended quotation. The erethitic temperament is . . . mobile . . . characterized by activity of mind and body . . . easily excited, responsive, impulsive, emotional and quick tempered. [Such individuals are] restless . . . many-sided, have many interests . . . objective rather than subjective . . . live more in the outer world of reality and action . . . mercurial . . . rash and hasty. The psychic tempo is rapid, and there is a slight tendency to distractibility. The general trend of this type is toward expression, and they are accessible and sociable. The kolytic temperament. . . is more calm and controlled, with a tendency to passivity of mind and body . . . [These individuals] appear cold, apathetic and indifferent. . . in- trospective, often heavy and plodding . . . slow tempered, self-centered and reflective, with a tendency to subjectivity. The psychic tempo is slow. They are the thinkers, the dreamers and visionaries, and they show a distinctly repressive tendency and are inclined to be shy and reserved. These descriptions are not only strikingly consistent with Lakalai concepts; they cover practically every important aspect of the Lakalai typology and do so in terms which are particularly apt for represent? ing much of the data reported in this paper.</page><page sequence="26">466 ETHNOLOGY One further example from yet another part of the Western psy? chological tradition is the work of Sheldon and his associates. Aside from his typology of body form, Sheldon has classified the "varieties of temperament," and it is this part of his work which concerns us here. Table 5 reproduces all the trait items which Sheldon and Stevens (1942: 26) developed for the short form of their scales of somatotonia and cerebrotonia. Opposite each of these items, match? ing traits from Lakalai Types I and II as previously summarized are placed in the appropriate positions. It can be seen from Table 5 that, apart from a few minor vari? ables in the scheme of Sheldon and Stevens which do not have match? ing factors in the existing Lakalai data, each of the Sheldon-Stevens TABLE 5 Sheldon's Classification and the Lakalai Typology Compared Sheldon's Somatotonia Lakalai Type I Assertiveness of posture and movement Love of physical adventure The energetic characteristic Need and enjoyment of exercise Love of risk and chance Bold directness of manner Physical courage for combat Competitive aggressiveness The unrestrained voice Overmaturity of appearance Active, animated, self-assertive, mobile Proficient at warfare, hunting, athletic games Energetic, active, animated, expressive Spatially mobile, proficient at hunting, athletic games, dancing Proficient at warfare, hunting, games, sexually active, involved in economic and practical affairs Aggressive, self-assertive, talkative, or? ganizational ability Proficient at warfare, hunting Aggressive, angry, quarrelsome, organi? zational ability, accumulation of wealth Talkative, loud Sheldon's Cerebrotonia Lakalai Type II Restraint in posture and movement Overly fast reactions Love of privacy Mental overintensity, hyper-attention- ality Apprehensiveness Secretiveness of feeling, emotional re? straint Self-conscious mobility of the eyes and face Sociophobia Inhibited social address Vocal restraint and general restraint of noise Youthful intentness of manner and ap? pearance Physically inactive, inhibited, controlled Solitary activity, withdrawal from con? tact, avoidance of groups, easily shamed Focused awareness, consistent attention, narrow deep interests Quiet, inhibited, unresponsive, sexually inactive, sensitive, easily shamed Withdrawal from contact, avoidance of groups, solitary activity Self-effacing, silent, withdrawn, uncom- municative, easily shamed Quiet, silent</page><page sequence="27">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 467 traits corresponds rather clearly to elements which are identifiable within the Lakalai system. Moreover, all the major dimensions abstracted from the Lakalai typology, as well as many of the specific items of that system, find corresponding representations in the Sheldon-Stevens scheme. There seem to be no major points of in- consistency between these two classifications. Theoretical Implications This is not the first time that pervasive resemblances have been noted between a nonliterate ethnopsychological system and a Western sociopsychological theory. Read (1959) noted a parallel between the "strong man" of the Gahuku and Riesman's "inner-directed" type (and by implication, between the "weak man" and the "other- directed" character). Wallace (1958) has called attention to a simi- larity between Iroquois psychological conceptions and Freudian theory. In the course of his discussion, Wallace (1958: 234-235) suggests that the discovery of such cases of "independent invention" raises certain important issues, such as "the dormant theoretical question of the nature of the psychic unity of mankind, and suggests the importance of the now unfashionable interest in the philosophical activities of 'primitive' peoples for the evaluation of psycholinguistic studies and theories of 'primitive' thought." The fact that two such similar theories of personality exist and function in such widely separated and mutually exotic social and cultural contexts raises with new force a question to which so far we can give only the most provisional answer. This is the question whether or to what extent the Lakalai typology corresponds to scien- tifically verifiable reality in the sense of being susceptible to objective validation. It was shown above that the Lakalai classification was generally consistent with data collected by the observational methods of the field anthropologist. We have seen that somewhat comparable findings are available from elsewhere in Melanesia (Read 1959). It has also been seen that recent psychological research by Eysenck and others has amassed impressive evidence that the Jungian typology and its relatives are scientifically verifiable. While such considera- tions certainly do not constitute convincing proof of the validity and reliability of the Lakalai system, they are suggestive in this direction. On the basis of these considerations it becomes possible to re- evaluate tentatively the four positions on the comparative applica? tion of personality typologies which were examined above. The apparent recognition by the Lakalai of both extraverted and intro- verted temperaments among themselves seems to throw considerable doubt on the early classification by Seligman and Pitt-Rivers, par? ticularly in its more simplistic form that all "savages" are extraverts. Similarly, the Roheim-Bettelheim formulation of the autoplastic orientation as a typically primitive personality style seems to be weakened by the apparent functional integration of both alloplastic and autoplastic personalities in Lakalai society. Both these conclu-</page><page sequence="28">468 ETHNOLOGY sions, moreover, are consistent with certain general trends discernible in the results of more recent studies of personality and culture: wide cross-cultural variabiiity and little empirical support for a single "primitive" type of psychological structure. The relevance of any single case is slightly different when applied to a position like that of Benedict. Judged in terms of the kind of dichotomy considered here and reflected in Benedict's Apollonian- Dionysian division, Lakalai society certainly does not appear to con? form to such a model. However, this obviously does not mean that Benedict's kind of analysis cannot be successfully applied to other societies, nor does it tell us anything about the distribution of per? sonality variables in the majority of societies around the world. On the other hand, our data from the Lakalai can be interpreted as a striking exemplification of Radin's thesis that both the "man of action" and the "thinker" are to be found in primitive societies, much as they are in Western civilization. It is quite apparent that the Lakalai do recognize their own thinkers as well as their men of action, and such evidence as we have indicates that this contrast is, in con? siderable part at least, a valid one. A theoretical issue which was long implicit in the literature of culture and personality, and which has recently been stated more explicitly, is relevant here. It was traditionally assumed by a majority of writers in this field (among whom Seligman, Roheim, and Benedict were pre-eminent) that patterned socialization typically produces a single modal personality (basic personality, national character, etc.) which is characteristic of most members of a society. Beginning per? haps with the recognition of individual uniqueness by Sapir (1949), continuing with the position taken by Radin, and then increasingly through the influence of such studies as Wallace's (1952) Rorschach demonstration that a modal personality could be identified in only a minority of one culturally unified population, this assumption has been open to question. More recently Wallace (1961: 26-41, 84-119) has argued ex? plicitly, first, that both motivational and cognitive nonuniformity are typical of human groups and, second, that such intra-societal variabiiity is a desideratum or even a functional requisite of organized social existence at the human level. Referring to the previously ruling approach as one which attempts to demonstrate the "replication of uniformity," he contrasts his own opposing view as one which stresses the "organization of diversity" through the perception of systems of partial behavioral equivalence (cf. Wallace 1962). Our Lakalai data, as far as they go, appear to be consistent with Wallace's position on this issue. Another challenge to traditional theory, which is more specifically relevant to the particular aspects of psychological variabiiity con? sidered here, comes from the work of Eysenck (1947 et sqq.). This researcher and his collaborators have come to the conclusion that the extraversion-introversion continuum represents a panhuman dimen? sion of variation in temperament which is genetically based and thus</page><page sequence="29">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 469 ultimately referable in part to hereditary determination. From an anthropological viewpoint it seems obvious that this hypothesis re? quires evaluation in the light of cross-cultural investigation. The Lakalai study reported here is consistent with Eysenck's position, but, in addition to its other inherent limitations, again as a single case it cannot be more than suggestive with respect to the question at issue. It thus appears that crucial questions remain unanswered as long as research is limited to psychological investigations of Western sub? jects or ethnographic studies of particular non-Western societies. The next step which seems to be suggested is a program of cross-cultural research which will provide objective data on the distribution of psy? chological factors in a series of societies chosen for their distinctiveness in presumably relevant cultural variables. For example, a major goal might be to obtain independent measures of the comparative frequency of extraverted and introverted traits under several sets of sociocultural conditions which appear consistent with different posi? tions on the temperament scale. An approach with such aims should be carried out within a con? ceptual framework which does not prejudge the questions raised by Wallace and Eysenck, but which at the same time makes use of the central core of existing personality-and-culture theory. The central conception in this field may be stated as the generalized proposition that distinctive personality configurations occur in different societies because individual development is conditioned by experience as struc? tured by cultural regularities ranging from socialization in infancy to behavior within available adult roles. An appropriate framework can perhaps be derived from the rather eclectic "biosocial approach" put forward some years ago by Gardner Murphy (1947). According to this formulation, personality structure develops through the establishment of differential responses first by early "canalization" and then increasingly by conditioning, perceptual learning, and the growth of social habits?all guided by regularities in the sociocultural milieu. More specifically, Murphy (1947: 594ff.) conceives of extraversion as a canalization of interest and energy toward the outer world, introversion as a canalization upon the inner self. Even assuming, with Eysenck and his collaborators, that poten- tialities for temperament are in some measure set initially by heredi? tary characteristics of the central nervous system, it remains a mean- ingful question how far such potentialities can be developed or sup- pressed by culturally determined canalization and conditioning. Similarly, it may be asked whether or to what extent such sociopsy- chological processes may tend in the direction of what Wallace calls the replication of uniformity in some cultures, while in others the or? ganization of diversity may be more prominent. Thus, with respect to introversion and extraversion, it can be suggested that some societies may be unimodally canalizing, while in others the process of canalization may be bimodal. The Lakalai and</page><page sequence="30">470 ETHNOLOGY our own society would then be examples in which bimodal canaliza- tion is well developed, resulting in considerable scope for the develop? ment of both extraverted and introverted temperaments. Societies which typically promote unimodal canalization, on the other hand, may include some which encourage extraversive trends and others which capitalize upon introversive traits. Thus if Benedict's analysis be accepted for the sake of discussion, Pueblo societies may be seen as characterized by unimodal introversive canalization, Plains Indian groups by unimodal extraversive canalization. Although possible examples are not so prominent in the literature, there would appear to be no a priori reason why either type of canalization should be confined to extremes in the range of tempera? ments. It seems perfectly conceivable that socialization, social statuses and roles, cognitive systems, and value orientations might be oriented so as to encourage and reward one or more relatively balanced temperamental types, such as the leading Lakalai individuals pre? viously described. Perhaps a useful clue to the choice of illustrative societies might be found in the high frequency of balanced experience types in populations for which Rorschach data are available (e.g., the Tepoztlecans as reported by Abel and Calabresi). Furthermore, the operation of sociopsychological processes such as canalization and conditioning may often be far from uniform with respect to the variables of internal social differentiation. As we have seen, even such a relatively undifferentiated society as Lakalai shows evidence of variabiiity in relation to the dimensions of age and sex. In other societies we might expect to find similar diversity with respect to social stratiflcation or any number of specialized statuses and roles. This would accord with Wallace's hypothesis of comple- mentary behavioral equivalence. Methodological Considerations and Emergent Hypotheses In order to gauge the utility of the theoretical considerations brought together above, it seems necessary to restate the principal points as testable hypotheses. Since the form of these propositions depends in part on the methods used to test them, more specific sug- gestions for future research require that a methodological approach be proposed. It seems consistent with what has been said so far to suggest that experimental studies carried out by Eysenck and his collaborators in London be replicated with subject populations drawn from selected non-Western societies. The advantages of the methods employed by Eysenck and his co-workers lie in their extensive use of objective tests, quantifiable measurements, and controlled experimental situations, results from all of which lend themselves to statistical analysis. The application of these techniques can be made highly systematic by the careful specification of operational definitions of the variables under investi? gation. Within this frame of reference, among other conceptual ad-</page><page sequence="31">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 471 vances, the relatively unrefined notion of mutually exclusive types is replaced by the concept of a continuum between measurable ex- tremes. All this is rendered coherent in terms of a theory of person? ality variability underlying which is a conception of neural functioning (Eysenck 1961). What is needed is a systematic program for applying these methods cross-culturally. Probably a selection of the tests and ex- perimental procedures already used in London could be made for such a program. Perhaps this could be done by psychologists and anthro? pologists collaborating for the purpose of choosing those techniques which might be most directly applicable cross-culturally or require the least adaptation for use in culturally exotic environments. Applica- tions of the chosen methods in field work among a series of non- Western peoples would presumably also require the collaboration of psychologists and anthropologists familiar with the groups under study. The resulting data could be analyzed by the established statistical methods, and conclusions could be amplified by integrating them with the results of sociological and cultural analysis. The selection of sample societies would be a crucial step in the development of any such research program. In line with the classi? fication of societies suggested in the preceding section, it would seem that the hypothetical possibilities might be minimally covered if the societal sample included one social system presumed on sociocultural grounds to be bimodally canalizing, one which appeared to be charac? terized by introversive canalization, one which showed evidence of apparent extraversive canalization, and one in which a balanced unimodal distribution seemed to be fostered. For example, the Lakalai, a Pueblo group, a Plains Indian tribe, and the people of Tepoztlan might constitute a minimal sample which would satisfy these requirements. Such groups also offer the advantage of being peoples for whom a moderate to large amount of anthropological in? formation is available. The work of Eysenck and his associates has depended on the availability of selected and internally differentiated sample popula? tions chosen on the basis of life histories, clinical examinations, and questionnaires. In many non-Western areas it would be difficult or impossible to obtain fully comparable groups of subjects. It might be necessary to carry out preliminary clinical surveys in the field. Here again, of course, problems of cross-cultural application of standard psychological or psychiatric procedures would loom large. Once more in this connection the advantages of societies with which anthro? pologists are familiar would appear to be considerable. Medical, psychiatric, and other agencies connected with American Indian reservations might be helpful in attacking these problems. Among such a people as the Lakalai, an obvious starting point for internal segregation of the subject sample would be their own classification of individuals according to their traditional typology. By drawing on the material presented above it is now possible to frame a number of predictions which could be tested by such a re-</page><page sequence="32">472 ETHNOLOGY search program. These can be stated in the form of three major hypotheses and a number of corollary, derived, or related propositions. 1. Introversion-extraversion will be a dimension of measurable varia? tion in each sample population, i.e., there will be a detectable occurrence of introverted, intermediate, and extraverted tempera- ments in each society. 1.1. Seligman's and Pitt-Rivers' hypothesis that nonliterate peoples are typically extraverted will not be supported. 1.2. The Roheim-Bettelheim hypothesis that nonliterate peoples are generally autoplastic (introverted) will not be supported. 1.3. Radin's hypothesis that both men of action (extraverts) and thinkers (introverts) occur in nonliterate groups will be sup? ported. 1.4. Eysenck's hypothesis that introversion-extraversion is a fundamental panhuman dimension of personality variation will receive support. 1.5. Wallace's hypothesis of diversity organized through comple- mentary behavioral and cognitive equivalences will receive support. 2. Bimodally canalizing societies (e.g., the Lakalai) will show a dis? tribution of extraversion and introversion similar to that found in Western populations, i.e., relatively balanced frequencies. 2.1. Individuals classified by the Lakalai as belonging to Type I ("men of anger") will tend to show extraverted traits. 2.2. Individuals classified by Lakalai as belonging to Type II ("men of shame") will tend to show introverted traits. 2.3. Leading individuals whom the Lakalai have difficulty classify- ing will tend to show relatively balanced trait configurations. 2.4. Lakalai women will tend to show more balanced trait con? figurations than Lakalai men. 2.5. Seemingly undifferentiated personalities which are difficult to classify in the Lakalai system will tend to show relatively balanced trait configurations. 3. Unimodally canalizing societies will tend to show a distribution of extraversion and introversion which is different from the results obtained with Western subjects. 3.1. Introversive canalization (e.g., in Pueblo Indian society) will tend to be associated with a high proportion of relatively in? troverted subjects. 3.2. Extraversive canalization (e.g., in Plains Indian society) will tend to be associated with a high proportion of relatively ex? traverted subjects. 3.3. Balanced unimodal canalization (e.g., in Tepoztlan) will be associated with a high frequency of individuals with traits intermediate between the extremes of introversion and extra? version.</page><page sequence="33">IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY 473 3.4. Benedict's hypothesis that a cultural group will tend to be characterized by a single personality type will receive limited, partial support in unimodally canalizing societies only. 3.5. The occurrence of individuals with trait configurations differ? ing from the central tendency will be correlated with variables of internal social differentiation, thus providing further sup? port for Wallace's position as stated in 1.5. One further assumption should perhaps be made explicit. It is assumed in the entire foregoing discussion that the differential genetically determined potentialities for temperament have approxi? mately the same distribution in all populations to be investigated. Should the predictions just stated turn out to be grossly invalid, one possible inference might be that this assumption is incorrect. Before this question can even be considered productively, however, some such program of research as that suggested here would have to be undertaken first. NOTE 1. Most of the Lakelai data presented here were gathered in the course of field work which I carried out in New Britain in 1956 under the sponsorship of the University of Pennsylvania, the Australian National University, and the U.S. Educational Found? ation in Australia. Field researches by W. H. Goodenough and A. Chowning in 1954 and by E. Valentine in 1954 and 1956 are gratefully acknowledged as sources of supple? mentary data. A briefer, more purely descriptive account of Lakalai ideas about per? sonality was contained in a paper which 1 gave at the Menninger Foundation in 1960. I am grateful to the University of Pittsburgh for a year's tenure as Mellon Postdoc- toral Fellow in Anthropology in 1960-61, during which time the analysis set forth here was developed. My thinking on the problems dealt with here has profited from semi- nar discussions at the University of Washington and from the comments of several colleagures, particullary John Atkins, Fred Adelman, and Raymond Fogelson.
