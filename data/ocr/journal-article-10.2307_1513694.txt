<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRIMITIVE ART PRECOLUMBIAN ART Bird Vessel Mexican (Olmec), izth-9th century B.C. Ceramic Height, 61A in. (i6.5 cm.) Rogers Fund, 1986 1986.45 Entries by Julie Jones, Curator; Kate Ezra, Assistant Curator. Vessels in the form of sculpture were produced in significant numbers in Precolumbian Mexico, and those made during Olmec times, or at about the turn of the first millennium B.C., are today among the most engaging of these works of art. The sculptures commonly represent birds, animals, and fish, all worked in well-modeled, if simplified, detail. Olmec ceramics are chiefly white or black; there are sculptural vessels in both colors, although black was favored. The latter, a product of the firing process, ranges in hue from dense, rich black to smoky gray. The surfaces were usually finished by a combina- tion of highly burnished and mat patterned textures. A powdered red pigment could be rubbed into the mat areas, producing a rose-pink cast that contrasts well with the polish of the plain dark ceramic. Even at this early date, Olmec command of technique, and subtlety of conception clearly illustrate the thorough understanding of the ceramic medium in Mexico. The Olmecs, an early American people who built their main centers along the Gulf Coast in southern Veracruz and adja- cent Tabasco, are known as great sculptors in all the mediums that have come down to us. Their sculptural ceramics are primarily from burials in the highlands of central Mexico, where Olmec political and/or religious influence had spread and where conditions for preserving these works were better than those of the humid Gulf Coast. The present vessel, said to be from central Mexico, depicts a fledgling bird of prey. A bird with partially spread wings, seated on a "basket," it appears to be squawking. It is com- posed of pleasing, well-integrated shapes and is quite natu- ralistically rendered, although at least one anthropomorphic aspect is present. The ears are human, and the lobes are embellished with circular ornaments. While the meaning of these details is unclear, combined human and animal features are a significant aspect of Olmec art, and birds of prey are identifiable within the Olmec corpus. Symbolic elements from other creatures such as jaguars and serpents can be included together with the raptor imagery.

Gift of Lester Wunderman, 1985 1985.422.2 Sometime in the fifteenth century, the Dogon people settled on the Bandiagara escarpment, a spectacular landscape of steep cliffs and craggy plateaus in the Sahel region of Mali. The austere beauty of this remote area, combined with the revelation that Dogon culture is based upon a complex and profound system of symbols and myths, has captured the imagination of Western scholars and art collectors since the beginning of the twentieth century. The Museum's collection of Dogon art has been enriched by this important standing male figure. Over his right shoulder he carries a hooked wooden staff that extends to his waist, in back. This type of implement, known as a dbmolo, is so characteristic of Dogon men that it has been called their "national weapon," and is considered an attribute of mascu- linity. The figure wears short trousers, the traditional garb of young Dogon men. The shorts depicted are cut high over each thigh, and are decorated with a panel of alternating horizon- tal and vertical stripes and zigzags in front, a triangular section of zigzags in the rear, and concentric circles over each hip. On his head appears to be a soft woven cotton cap, pushed back behind the ears and draped over the nape of the neck in one of the many styles in which Dogon men wear this flexible garment. A sheathed knife is strapped to his upper left arm, a pendant is depicted in relief on his chest, and multiple incised bands encircle his wrists and ankles. The figure is also bearded, indicating that he is an elder and therefore worthy of respect. The short pants and the staff- attributes of a young man-do not refute this status, but, rather, conform to the African preference for portraying persons of spiritual or political power, usually achieved in old age, as if they were physically in the prime of life. Several of these features-and such others as the projecting beard, rimmed and bulging eyes, and domed forehead-are also seen on terracotta sculptures from the nearby Inland Niger Delta region of Mali. The terracottas were probably made from the twelfth to the eighteenth century, and it has been suggested that some of the Dogon wood figures may be contemporaneous with them. The Dogon claim that many of the wood sculptures found on the Bandiagara cliffs were the work of the Tellem people who lived there before the Dogon arrived. The arid climate of the cliffs, and the fact that the sculptures were often stored in caves that protected them from the elements, may have enabled them to survive longer than wood sculpture in more humid parts of Africa. Radio- carbon analyses of some Dogon, or Tellem, sculptures have been undertaken to establish their age, but, although the results have generally supported the relative antiquity of Dogon art, they have so far not been conclusive. There are wide variations in Dogon sculptural style. This figure is similar to a number of others-especially, to a stand- ing female figure in the collection of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts-that have in common a relatively fleshy, well- rounded body, long thick neck and long oval head, broad mouth, wide and slightly bulging eyes, and strongly project- ing chin or beard. The figures in this group often incorporate subtle asymmetrical elements, such as a raised or bent arm- as in our example. This gesture, together with the slight paunch and the position of the knees-flexed and ready to spring into action-enlivens the sculpture and lends it a genre-like, almost casual aspect. While much has been writ- ten about the mythological basis of Dogon sculpture, many Dogon figures, including this one, are portrayed in activities that seem to refer more to everyday life-men playing musical instruments or riding horses, women using mortars and pestles or holding and feeding children-than to the events of Dogon myth. The full meaning of this figure's gesture, as well as its date, awaits further field research. KE Bibliography: Jean Laude, African Art of the Dogon, Brooklyn, 1973, no. 42.
