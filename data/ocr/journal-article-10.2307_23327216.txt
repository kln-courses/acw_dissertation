Effects of GSM 900 MHz on Middle Cerebral Artery Blood Flow Assessed by Transcranial Doppler Sonography. Radiat. Res. 178, 543-550 (2012). Mobile phone use has increased worldwide but its possible effects on the brain remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of acute exposure to a radio frequency electromagnetic field (RF EMF) generated by a mobile phone operating in the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) 900 MHz on cerebral blood flow. Twenty-nine volunteers attended two experimental sessions: a sham exposure session and a real exposure session in a cross over double-blind study in which a mobile phone was positioned on the left side of the head. In one session, the mobile phone was operated without RF radiation (sham phone) and in the other study it was operated with RF radiation (real phone) for 20 min. Thus, each subject served as its own control. Middle cerebral artery blood flow was monitored noninvasively by transcranial Doppler sonography to measure middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity. Pulsatility index and resistance index were also evaluated. A voluntary breath holding physiological test was carried out as a positive control for testing cerebral vasoreactivity. Hemodynamic variables were recorded and analyzed before, during and after mobile phone exposure. No significant changes were detected in studied variables in middle cerebral arteries during sham or real exposure. In the exposed side the cerebral blood flow velocity, the pulsatility index and the resistance index during sham and real exposure were respectively: [61.9 ± 1.3, 61.7 ± 1.3 cm/s (P = 0.89)]; [0.93 ± 0.03, 0.90 ± 0.02 (P = 0.84)] and [0.58 ± 0.01, 0.58 ± 0.01 (P = 0.96)] at baseline; and [60.6 ± 1.3, 62 ± 1.6 cm/s (P = 0.40)]; [0.91 ± 0.03, 0.87 ± 0.03 (P = 0.97)]; [0.57 ± 0.01, 0.56 ± 0.01 (P = 0.82)] after 20 min of exposure. Twenty minutes of RF exposure to a mobile phone does not seem to affect the cerebral circulation. © 2012 by Radiation Research Society 'Address for correspondence: Institut National de l'Environnement Industriel et des Risques (INERIS), Department of Experimental Toxicology, BP.2, 60550 Verneuil-en-Halatte, France; e-mail: rania. ghosn@ineris.fr. 2These authors contributed equally to this work. INTRODUCTION Mobile phone use is ubiquitous with estimated subscrip tions globally close to 6 billion (1). Given the large number of mobile phone users worldwide, it is possible that the effects on human health can become a great public debate and a concern for scientists. During mobile phone calls, the brain is one of the most exposed parts of the body to the radio frequency electromagnetic field (RF EMF). Some studies have been conducted on the effects of RF EMF exposure on brain activity. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) has been evaluated in some studies using different techniques. The observed results are contradictory. Using positron emission tomography (PET), an increase in the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the exposed hemisphere was reported (2, 5). Another study has reported no effect in the area of maximum RF EMF exposure, whereas a bilateral decrease of CBF in the auditory cortex was observed (4). The authors suggested that this finding was most likely confounded by an auditory signal emitted by the battery of the active phone. Later, the same authors found a significant rCBF decrease near the peak specific absorption rate (SAR, W/kg: the energy absorbed per unit of tissue mass) and an increase at various other locations deeper in the brain (5). However, this time the confounding effects of noise from the mobile phone battery were eliminated. Cerebral circulation was recorded by using impedance pulse waves rheoencephalog raphy (REG), before, during and after mobile phone exposure (6). The REG reflects the tissue blood flow supplied by the internal carotids. A slight, but not significant decrease in the amplitude of the impedance (REG) pulse wave during the exposure was observed. Recently, it has been shown that EMF emitted by digital UMTS (frequently called third generation 3G) mobile phone does not affect rCBF in humans (7). Another study with PET technology has reported a slight temperature rise in the ear canals induced by the exposure, but no effect was reported on brain hemodynamics and task performance (S). Also, a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) study conducted in young boys (14-15 years old) reported no significant 543</page><page sequence="2">544 GHOSN ET AL. changes in CBF and ear canal temperature between sham and exposed groups (9). The few studies performed on RF effect on cerebral hemodynamics are not conclusive, and the discrepancies in the results might be due to the variety of techniques used to assess CBF, or to different classes of ages, protocols, exposure systems, exposure levels and durations. Due to limited data and inconclusive evidence of an RF EMF effect on CBF, further studies are needed to fill the gap in knowledge. In our study we used transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography to assess cerebral blood flow velocity (CBF-V) as the main parameter and analyze its waveform. CBF-V was recorded continuously before, during and after the RF exposure emitted by a 900 MHz digital GSM phone. MATERIALS AND METHODS Human Subjects The study was carried out at the Clinical Research Center (CRC) in Amiens University Hospital. The protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Nord-Ouest II, No. ID RCB: 2010-A00547-32). The volunteers were given information about the study and they provided a written consent on their participation before entering the study. The general health of the subjects was checked in the medical examination before the study session in the CRC. Twenty-nine healthy volunteers (10 males and 19 females) participated in this study. They were between the ages of 21 35 years old (mean ± SD: 25.4 ± 4.0 years). The volunteers were selected after routine clinical examination. Inclusion criteria included regular sleep habits, no medication, no chronic disease or disability, no recent acute illness, no smoking, and no neurological or respiratory vascular history. Those selected were instructed to abstain from consuming alcohol and coffee for 24 h before and during each experimental session. In addition, subjects were asked to abstain from using a mobile phone 2 h before each experimental session. Transcranial Doppler Sonography The use of transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography to monitor the velocity of blood in the basal cerebral arteries was first reported by Aaslid et al. in 1982 (10). The technique is based upon measurement of the Doppler frequency shift of reflected ultrasonic waves backscattered by moving blood cells (11). As the various cerebral arteries each have their own characteristic TCD waveform, depth, location and flow direction, this allows for their unique identification by sonography (12). TCD is a noninvasive technique that allows for constant monitoring of mean flow velocity in an intracerebral artery (13). In this study, TCD (LOOKI 2TC, ATYS Medical, Soucieu En Jarrest, France) was used to assess peak systolic velocity, diastolic velocity and cerebral artery blood flow velocity in middle cerebral arteries (MCA). Two Doppler ultrasound probes were focused bilaterally on the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) by the thin temporal cranial "window" for simultaneous symmetrical recording. The two 2 MHz-probes (ATYS 1133) were positioned by using the helmet support of the Doppler device. Blood velocities were measured at a depth between 5(&gt;-56 mm depending on the anatomical position of each volunteers' MCA. These depths met the literature data of proximal middle cerebral artery usually recognized at the depth range 50-60 mm (14). All TCD data were stored on a hard disk for further analysis. Pulsatility index and resistance index were also calculated. For waveform analysis, all recordings were digitalized by an analog digital converter with a 100 Hz sampling rate. CBF-V The most commonly measured variable by TCD is the blood flow velocity (15). TCD allows a moment-to-moment study of the cerebral blood flow velocity in the artery under study (76); in our study, this was in the middle cerebral arteries. Comparisons were performed within each session (sham or exposure) between pre-exposure period (BL1), exposure period (EP) and post exposure period (BL2) and between sessions (sham vs. exposure). Pulsatility Index (PI) and Resistance Index (RI) Middle cerebral arteries PI and RI were calculated from flow velocity waveforms. Digitized waveforms were stored as ASCII files for off-line calculation. PI and RI were calculated according to the formulas below. PI was calculated as (Vra„ - Vra¡n)/Vmem with Vmax = peak systolic blood flow velocity, Vmin = minimum diastolic velocity and Vmean = time averaged maximum velocity (17). In the cerebral vasculature, high PI can indicate higher peripheral vessel resistance concomitant with increased intracranial pressure (18). RI was calculated as (Vmax - Vmin)/Vmax with Vmax = peak systolic blood flow velocity and Vmin = minimum diastolic velocity (19). As flow velocity ratios, PI and RI do not depend on the insonation angle (20). Heart rate (HR). Heart rate was calculated from the TCD wave according to the formula: HR = 60/R-R (R-R is the interval between an R wave and the next R wave). Breath holding test (BH). A voluntary BH (—30 s) physiological test was carried out as a positive control to check the ability of TCD to demonstrate physiological changes in cerebral artery flow velocity. Breath holding test is usually used for testing cerebral vasoreactivity and cerebral regulation (21). The test was applied twice for each subject before and after sham or real exposure to RF EMF. Comparison was performed between data obtained in the BH period and in the control BL period. Skin temperature. Skin temperature was measured continuously during the study. It was measured on the cheek and behind the earlobe on both sides of the head by four channels with a Luxtron optical thermometer (Luxtron Fluoroptic Thermometer, Model 790, Santa Clara, CA). Exposure System and Dosimetry Subjects were exposed to RF EMF by a commercial dual band GSM mobile phone (Nokia 6650). To set the standard exposure parameters, the phone was connected to a personal computer to control the required frequency and RF power by service software (Phoenix, Nokia Corp., Finland). The participants received GSM modulated exposure with the full power of the mobile phone (2 W peak, 250 mW average, pulse modulated with 1/8 duty cycle) at 900 MHz for 20 min. The phone was placed in a holder attached to the Doppler probe helmet. All parts of the helmet were made of nonmetallic plastic materials to avoid any perturbation of the EMF emitted by the mobile phone. The sham or genuine exposure was carried out using a "load" or a "dummy load", respectively. For this purpose an external power load was connected to the external antenna connector of the phone. A 50-ohm resistive load and an open-circuit dummy load were developed for sham/exposed conditions with the same shape and structure to allow for the double-blind protocol of the study. The measurements of SAR (W/kg) were made in a standard SAM phantom (Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin phantom, Antennes sa, France) filled with standard brain tissue-equivalent liquid (Satimo, France) according to CENELEC standard EN 50361 (22). A small electric field probe (06-ÉP64, Satimo, France) connected to a microvoltmeter (Keithley, Cleveland, OH) was used for the measure ment of the electric field strength within the liquid.</page><page sequence="3">EFFECT OF GSM 900 MHZ ON CEREBRAL CIRCULATION 1st session Positionning Real MP I Removing Real MP I ■ * '—I -10 -8 -3 BL1.1 BH1 BL1.2 1 f Time (min.) 1 IE I I I | I I 5 10 15 20 +1 +5 +10 +15 +20 +25 +30 BH2 BL2 One week apart 2nd s Real Exposure Post-Exposure Sham Exposure Post-Exposure Positionning Sham MP Removing sham MP FIG. 1. Timeline of the two experimental sessions. Each volunteer participated in two recording sessions in a crossover randomized double blind paradigm. In one session, a real mobile phone (MP) was used and a sham mobile phone was used in the other session. Exposure time was 20 min. The two sessions were separated by one week. The maximum SARs averaged on 10 g tissue, 1 g tissue, or the peak value were 0.49 W/kg, 0.70 W/kg and 0.93 W/kg, respectively. To confirm the effectiveness of the load, the SAR test and a surface scanning of the electric field of the "sham" phone was performed. The SAR of the "sham" phone was below the detection level of the system (0.001 W/kg) at any position of the phantom, and no electric field was detected on the surface of the "sham" phone. The SARs were also measured when the TCD probe was placed on the phantom at the site of the cranial window beside the mobile phone according to the protocol of the study. In this arrangement, the SARs averaged on 10 g tissue, 1 g tissue or the peak were 0.53 W/kg, 0.76 W/kg, and 1.03 W/kg, respectively. The possible interaction between the electronic system of the physiological device and the RF stray field was evaluated. No artifact or additional noise could be seen on the TCD waveforms when RF emission was switched on. Study Protocol Each subject participated in two 100 min sessions in a crossover, randomized, double-blind paradigm. During each session, the subject was exposed to 20 min of sham or real exposure (Fig. 1). For the sham exposure, the mobile phone was switched "on" without RF radiation, and for the real exposure, the mobile phone was switched "on" with RF radiation. For the same subject, the two sessions were separated by a week. Both the subjects and the experimenters were unaware of the exposure condition (double-blind design). Subjects were installed in a chair to check the location of the Doppler probes at the temporal level in the right and left pre-auricular areas, and then for the installation of the Doppler helmet and positioning of the ultrasound probes of 2 MHz for the middle cerebral arteries (Fig. 2). A slow scan of the area was performed by the probe to identify the point of best transmission in the temporal region in front of and above the external auditory canal. The Luxtron temperature device was connected to a personal computer by an RS232 serial port to collect the skin temperatures continuously during the study, with 10 s interval samplings. For skin temperature measurements, four optical temperature probes were applied on the skin, two on each side (right and left side), one probe on the cheek and one under the earlobe (Fig. 2). Additional measures of temperature were performed on the surface of the phones (real and sham) alone. Subjects were asked to lie down in a semi recumbent position on a bed. They remained instrumented as not to modify the positioning of the probes. There was no sound or visual stimulation. The state of awakening was visually controlled by the experimenter. The Doppler helmet and probes positions were first adjusted, and the recordings were then performed once the subject was installed on the bed. The ultrasound power of TCD probes was turned as low as possible to provide artifact-free recordings. Pre-exposure period (10 min): a first baseline (BL1.1) was recorded, then a first breath holding test (BH1) consisting of a voluntary retention of breath during 30 s was applied. Before the end of this pre exposure period, a second baseline was recorded (BL1.2). The BL1 shown in this paper is the average between BL1.1 and BL1.2. Exposure period (20 min): the phone (sham or real) was placed in position by the holder attached to the helmet on the left side (Fig. 2). The exposure period was 20 min. Four recordings were performed at the 5, 10, 15 and 20 min points during the exposure period. At the end of exposure, the mobile phone was carefully removed. FIG. 2. Position of probes and MP during experimental sessions. The mobile phone and the 2 MHz-probe (1) for transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) were attached to the Doppler probe helmet (4). Two optical temperature probes were positioned on the left cheek (2) and under the left earlobe (3) (exposed side). A second TCD probe similar to the first and two optical temperature probes were also positioned on the right side (control side) for simultaneous symmetrical recording.</page><page sequence="4">546 GHOSN ET AL. ~©~ right side sham exp. -E3- left side sham exp. right side real exp. left side real exp. 70 Middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity Exposure Post-exposure - M-i-M-I i " "'"-1 i i l- I i - '■? 4 r 1 i ± I t i 65 60 55 50' 03 «/"&gt; -H 1^1 O -h (N O (N (N u CQ FIG. 3.

The results were expressed as a mean ± SEM. n = 29. Post-exposure period (20 min): five recordings were performed at the 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min points during the post-exposure period. After the post-exposure period a second breath holding test (BH2) was applied (same conditions as BH1). The last recording was the BL2. Each TCD recording was spread over a period of 1 min (Fig. 1). Data and Statistical Analysis All TCD recordings were further visually scored to eliminate artifacts, and all waveform analyses and all trend analyses were performed on artifact-free samples. For waveform and trend analysis, the duration of the TCD analyzed recordings was 60 s, which included approximately 60 pulse waves, depending on the heart rate (HR). All analyzed data were based on the average of approximately 60 pulse waves. GraphPad Prism 5 was used for statistical analysis, Student's t test was applied for paired data, and the analysis of variance (repeated measures) was applied to test the changes within and between the groups. RESULTS Human Subjects The mean body mass index of the subjects was 22.9 ± 2.7. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 126.3 ± 12.8 and 72 ± 8.5 mmHg (mean ± SD), respectively.

Indeed, during sham exposure the temperature rose up to 1.4°C in the cheek and 0.4°C under the ear, respectively, while it increased up to 2°C and 0.5°C during real exposure. Increase in cheek temperature was significantly higher by 0.6°C with the real phone than with the sham phone (t test: P &lt; 0.05). After 20 min of transmission, the temperature of the sham phone rose from 24.45 to 27.33°C while the temperature of the real phone rose from 24.81 to 28.39°C. Heating produced from the real phone was found to be 0.7°C higher than the sham phone. DISCUSSION In this study, we measured the cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries by transcranial Doppler sonography. It is known that in the cerebral circulation, the blood flow is predominantly controlled by vasomotricity of large arteries, whereas it depends mainly on arterioles elsewhere in the systemic circulation (23, 24). It is important to specifically examine regulation of large arteries because they may respond selectively to some stimuli. The advantage of the TCD recording in our protocol is that this method provides continuous monitoring, suitable and widely used for the diagnostic and follow-up of cerebrovascular disorders. The other methods of CBF examination such as positron emission tomography (PET) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have some disad vantages. The PET has limited time resolution of the recording (and is partially invasive due to the contrast solution introduced into the circulation) and NIRS presents high variation between subjects and the variability of the</page><page sequence="6">548 GHOSN ET AL.

In our study the BH was used as positive control. The BH is known as a vasoreactivity test to assess the vasodilatory or vasoconstrictory capacity of the arteries in the brain (25). Cessation of breathing is a physiological stimulus that produces a hemodynamic response related to the altered metabolic situation of the brain parenchyma. The BH carried out in this study showed a significant increase (P &lt; 0.001) in CBF-V, and a significant decrease (P &lt; 0.001) in PI and RI was observed in both sides, before and after sham or real exposure. During this test, and due to C02 increase in the blood, the CBF-V was increased more than 30% as a result of vasodilation induced by hypercapnia. These results affirm the validity of the method used to explore cerebral circulation.

The results of our present study indicate that RF radiation emitted from GSM-type mobile phones did not significantly change CBF-V during or after 20 min of exposure. Skin temperature of the exposed side had been increased by both phones (real and sham). The heating of the phone body was attributed to the battery or the electronic circuit. However, temperature magnitude was significantly higher with the real phone, suggesting that RF EMF had also contributed to the heating. Given that no effect was observed on the CBF-V of the temporal lobe, it could be concluded that under our conditions of exposure, RF did not have any influence on the CBF-V. Previous studies have investigated the effects of mobile phone EMF exposure on brain metabolism using PET or NIRS. With the same technique, however, different results were also reported. In PET studies, one group reported that rCBFs increased significantly in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the exposed hemisphere (i). The second group demonstrated a decrease in rCBFs in the left fusiform gyrus just underneath the antenna, and an increase in the bilateral medial and superior frontal gyri (5). Recently, some authors reported that there are no significant changes in cerebral blood flow caused by EMF exposure (7, 8), and different results were also reported in NIRS studies. One group observed a slight influence on desoxyhemoglo bin and oxyhemoglobin (26, 27), while a recent study reported no changes in the same parameters during the sham and exposure periods (9). Results from different techniques are scarce and differ from one another. The comparison is then difficult; hence the question about the RF effect on CBF remains unanswered. Some studies examined the rCBF changes only after EMF exposure (2,3) or only during exposure (4,5). However, the</page><page sequence="7">EFFECT OF GSM 900 MHZ ON CEREBRAL CIRCULATION present study investigated changes not only after but also during exposure conditions. Since we found no significant modifications with the measured variables in MCA in either of these periods, this study supports the conclusion that there is no effect on cerebral circulation. Again, it is important to note that very few studies that include measurements before and after exposure to EMF have demonstrated a significant effect of nonthermal levels of electromagnetic radiation on blood flow. Furthermore, none has been independently replicated (7). Skin temperature measurements showed a greater increase after 20 min of exposure with real phones and not with sham phones (up to 2°C and up to 1,4°C, respectively). Our goal was to observe whether exposure to RF induced changes in different physiological variables studied, sepa rating the effects due to RF exposure and those due to heating, therefore, the use of two telephones (real and sham). But warming up by the two phones was not strictly the same. So if there had been an effect, it could perhaps have not only been attributed to the heating of RF emitted by the actual phone, but also to the conductive heating produced by the battery and eletronics of the mobile phone. However, no significant changes in CBF-V were observed during or after exposure to the sham and real phone. Conversely, the transcranial Doppler monitoring could have caused tissue heating, but as the design of the study was adequate, inasmuch as the volunteers undergo TCD monitoring with the same parameters for sham or real RF radiation exposure, this specific heating could not have influenced the comparison between the two experimental sessions. Thus we can conclude that 20 min of mobile phone exposure to RF EMF does not affect cerebral circulation measured by TCD. The temperature increase produced at the level of the skin was mainly produced by the conductive heating of the phone and less by RF exposure. In fact, the skin constitutes the first barrier against the heat transfer to brain tissue, and the relatively cold blood entering the heated area will cool the tissue. Thus the warming derived from the slight rise of the temperature at the level of the skin (up to 2°C) will be weaker at the level of the brain tissue (28). It is therefore unlikely that a physiological reaction will occur in the brain under such variation (29, SO). The human brain is a complex structure susceptible to many types of damage and disease. Despite being protected by the thick bones of the skull, brain tissue remains exposed to RF. Any changes of cerebral circulation and metabolism have an important role in the processes of neuronal activity as evidenced by electroencephalography (EEG). For interpretation of any EEG changes during mobile phone exposure, we need relevant information of possible changes in cerebral blood flow. Therefore, studies on cerebral circulation are essential to evaluate the possible interaction of exposure to RF with the central nervous system, even more so in the interpretation of data obtained from EEG studies related to mobile phone exposure published during the last years. CONCLUSION In conclusion, this study assessed the effects induced by a normal daily exposure (duration: 20 min) to a GSM mobile phone on measures of cerebral blood flow velocity noninvasively and safely evaluated by TCD used within insonation parameters recommended limits. Data showed no significant changes in cerebral blood flow velocity, pulsatility index and resistance index in middle cerebral arteries during exposure. These negative results show that by TCD method no measurable changes were observed in the cerebral blood velocity. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that other minor biological and neurophysiolog ical influences during mobile phone exposure might not be detectable by the current method.
