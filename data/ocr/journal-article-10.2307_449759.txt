<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recen.t Studies in the Nineteenth Century STUART CURRAN No amount of imaginative sympathy for the muted complaints of one's predecessors quite prepares an inno- cent academic for the purgatorial experience of this review. This year's mountain is smaller than last year's, somewhat lacking in its distinctive, curious outcroppings, but larger than that of the year before. For all one hears about the severe cutback in publication and the troubles of the academic presses, alps seem still to rise on alps. There is a satisfaction to be had from attainitng the summit of a mun- dane Mount of Purgatory, but it is not Dante's, still less Wordsworth's. If one does not see through the swirling clouds an organized imaginative unity in the profession of letters, one can at least testify to a high level of intellectual energy and some substantial achievements in this year's work on the nineteenth century. It is only fair to say, however, that about one quarter of the books surveyed here have no compelling reason for their publication. They may establish their authors' professional credentials and lend weight to librarians' pleas for expanded storage, but they add nothing serious to scholarship or criticism. The writer of a sweeping review cannot help being acutely con- scious of the unnecessary demands a super-saturated profession is placing on its members-placing, too, on the presses that have had to assume the responsibility of arbitrating academic success. The major presses have in general maintained an admirable discretion, and the almost inevitable result has been the development of an underground academic press, so to speak, which is chiefly responsible for the preponderance of books in the Romantic period this year. Salzburg Studies in English Literature, under the pretentious rubric "Roman- tic Reassessment," is releasing a veritable flood of dissertations, which, mainly unrevised and frequently out of date, constitute a can- did indictment of graduate education. And yet, this series cannot be dismissed out-of-hand: there are useful efforts that no established press would find marketable and even some significant critical statements included in what otherwise is a very depressing list. It is a much longer list than the books represented here would suggest, and a reviewer is inclined to count blessings that a comparative few cross- ed his desk. Aside from the evidence supplied by such a dissertation</page><page sequence="2">638 RECENT STUDIES mill, there are other signs that the recent era of specialized rigidity has had a deleterious effect on academic writers. Even very fine books in- cluded in this review have a tendency to become shallow or wholly misinformed when they peer beyond their carefully limited perimeters. Victorian scholars talk of Romanticism and Romantic poets with a looseness that would be offensive to specialists in the earlier period, who in turn lose all depth when they cross 1832. Although the last years have seen repeated professions about the unities of nineteenth-century literature, many critics, especially those whose focus is a single author, reflect an unhealthy isolation. Such a state is perhaps to be expected, and it is clear from the predominance in this year's list of books devoted to one author, or even one work, that a deep concentration often produces deep analysis. The rebuilding of reputations must be dependent upon it, and much of Victorian scholarship during the past year has had such ends in mind. The Routledge Author Guides to Cobbett and Macaulay, reassessments of Carlyle, Browning, and Hardy, all tend to deepen the significance of their art and ideas and will certainly have an impact on future estimates of these authors. The dearth of historical scholarship among the year's offerings is somewhat sur- prising, but the few instances of it are highly distinguished and suggestive of areas for further expansion. In the Romantic period, ex- cept for the continuing pell-mell rush into the Blakean Eden from whose gates Frye dislodged the Covering Cherub some time back, the achievements of the year are editorial. These efforts are not merely impressive for the discipline and commitment they reflect, but also will be productive of sounder, more assured work by subsequent scholars. If one can safely abstract a single tendency from the diversity of interests and methodologies embodied in the books of this year, it is not toward the experimentation or the absorption of other disciplines that one might have expected from the unrest of the last several years. Rather, to borrow Arnold's term, we seem to be in an era of consolida- tion. That is not as bad as it may sound, for the results are anything but conservative. If the simple answers of the past are no longer satisfactory, it is to the credit of literary scholars that they are so persis- tent in building a foundation for the present and the future. For the purpose of organization I have gathered the disparate books covered by this unifying century into three groups. The first includes the Romantics, with a single exception poets, and the Victorian poets; the second is devoted to fiction; and the third gathers together the writers of Victorian prose, the fin de siecle, and, in general, the cultural historians. We begin with assured mastery. It has been more than a decade</page><page sequence="3">STUART CURRAN 639 since the second volume of the Coleridge notebooks was issued and, in league with the first published four years previously, had an im- pact that is still incalculable. With the appearance of The Notebooks of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Volume 3, again under the editorship of Kathleen Coburn (Princeton), the recent concentration on Coleridge's philosophical speculations will receive greater impetus. The volume covers the period of Coleridge's great lectures and most enduring aesthetic criticism, the years 1808 to 1819. To say that the editing is distinguished is to offer much too mild praise. With a large volume of text and an even more massive sequel of notes, the effect is nearly awesome. Coleridge studs his text with quotations from Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and German, frequently playing with words in these and other languages. fo trace these debts was a prodigious undertaking, as was pointing exact sources in the likes of Kant and Schelling. In this period Coleridge was likewise investigating the sciences, and many of his speculations demand a learned awareness of contexts scarcely known today. In all respects Coburn's notes are remarkable for precision, conciseness, and knowledge. For the stu- dent of Coleridge's prose this volume has special significance, since it records so much that never went into the lectures, the religious and philosophical writings. But there is at least one very important text for those who love his poetry, the draft of Limbo, whose many cancellations will surely aid in elucidating this enigmatic poem. Whatever one's special interest, the index alone is of inestimable value: Coleridge's richly absorbent mind interacts with a panoply of contemporary writers. Kathleen Coburn's fellow scholars, now and in the future, owe her and the many colleagues whose help she acknowledges in a generous introduction a great debt of gratitude. Donald Ault's Visionary Physics: Blake's Response to Newton (Chicago) deserves a number of prizes: as the foremost contribution to nineteenth-century scholarship of this year; as the most significant breakthrough in Blake studies at least since Erdman's and perhaps since Frye's; as the single most difficult book ever published on Blake. Ault is one of those fortunate souls who not only reads literature with uncanny perception, but is equally at home in the most abstruse reaches of science and mathematics. He writes at an almost in- tolerable level of abstraction, and yet a book that refuses to separate Blake's philosophy from the inherited conceptual frameworks of the Enlightenment rightfully demands a minute knowledge of the classical tradition exemplified by Descartes and Newton. Ault's argumentation is dense, sometimes nearly opaque, not susceptible to easy paraphrase here, but clearly substantiating his claim that Blake's epic prophecies constitute a Principia which subsumes and reverses</page><page sequence="4">640 RECENT STUDIES Newton's. Wading bravely into waters most Blakeans ignore, Ault reveals the extent to which the images, ideas, and the very terminology-states, limits of opacity and contraction, void, ratio, minute particular, fluxion, vortex, etc.-derive from an intimate knowledge of Cartesian and Newtonian physics. The universe that Urizen and, after him, Los build is Newtonian to its core, and to redeem it Blake must redeem the formulations of his contemporary science. To say that is easy enough, but the argument poses a radical- ly different way of reading Blake's epic conceptions. Vala is no longer a mere archetype of nature, but stands as one of Newton's most far- reaching mental inventions, the fluxional calculus by which process can be determined through mathematical ratio. The epic warfare between Urizen and Luvah-Vala is a conflict of conceptual systems, between Urizen's logic that denies time and Vala's dialectic that denies space. Blake's purpose is to succeed where Newton failed, in discovering the underlying principle of integration. He thus assumes a crucial place in the history of science, one that Ault, without saying so, surely recognizes is far-reaching in its modernity. Blake scholars cannot but learn greatly from this book, which almost requires run- ning scholia, and its implications will still be revealing themselves years from now. But in all candor, a final word is necessary: Ault's writing abounds with scientific lapses-barbarisms, coinages, jargon, even solecisms-that betray a lack of copy-editing, as does the error-strewn printing, with shifting type-fonts, omitted words, and repeated lines. So important a book should not also deserve a booby- prize for presentation. If recent Blake scholarship has been exhilarating, it has also been maddening because assimilation of scholarly labors takes so long with so many pursuing their independent paths. Thomas Frosch's study, The Awakening of A lbion: The Renovation of the Body in the Poetry of William Blake (Cornell) is a case in point. It is a very good book, written with deep perception and clarity, in its careful marking of perimeters leading us to see further into Blake's idea of sensuality and sexuality-"at once visionary and anti-mystical"-than has hitherto been possible. But no effort is made to incorporate Jean Hagstrum's recent work in this area, nor, indeed, anything written on Blake in the past half-dozen years, a period of ferment about Frosch's themes. He claims to approach Blake from a phenomenological viewpoint, but his ideology is often contradicted by his methodology, which centers on crucial concepts, involving us in stasis rather than wholesome flux. Frosch elaborates on what he conceives to be Blake's myth of the fall, but Blake has many such myths, and to equate the fall in The Book of Urizen with the fall in Jerusalem is to negate Blake's</page><page sequence="5">STUART CURRAN 641 sense of distinctive identity. Elucidating Blake's attack on a single perspective with precision, Frosch has not himself found a form con- genial to multi-perspectivism. And in an important way this leads him into substantial error, from which recent scholarship (the Erdman-Grant Blake's Visionary Forms Dramatic, for instance) might have saved him. Frosch rightly conceives of the regenerate body as allowing all the senses harmonious expansion, but then pur- sues a sophistical account of the Blakean epic as an auditory mode breaking the eye's spell. While it is pleasant to imagine a scholar chanting his way through Jerusalem, it is also incredible that one can ignore the sensual experience of Blake's illuminations. The phenomenological experience of a Blake poem is nothing like the one Frosch suggests, but it is through Blake's rich art of engraving an ex- perience of multiple perspectives: as Frosch later acknowledges, "the risen man has many eyes." Aside from this sort of lapse, however, Frosch is highly sensitive to Blake's subtleties, as in his discussion of the ambivalent nature of metaphor or in his sharp distinction between Golgonooza, the fallen city of art, and Jerusalem, the regenerate city in which distinctions between art and life, like those between the senses and the intellect, no longer exist. If Frosch lacks feeling for shifts in Blake's mythology and for the nuances of his visual art, he contributes a most enlightening study. Basing her book on exactly those elements he neglects, Anne Kostelanetz Mellor has written a book-Blake's Human Form Divine (California)-whose inadequacies are so glaring that it is a wonder that it found print in this shape. Seeking to explain Blake's develop- ing conception of form, the book argues that Blake initially cast his faith in the closed world of innocence, then with growing distrust of rationality adopted the open form of energy, and finally managed to bound it in the lineaments of the "human form divine," which is Christ. Mellor's sense of form is almost exclusively pictorial, never acknowledging that Blake's development also entails a movement through literary genres, from an early pastoralism through con- tinuing experimentation to a radical epic prophecy. Not only does the author have little sense of form, she has almost no concept of con- cept. On consecutive pages myth is equated with symbol and then with iconography: with such imprecision anything is possible. One is more irritated than surprised to find that in so tendentious an argu- ment contrary evidence is suppressed and hypothesis raised to the level of certainty: the so-called late final plate of The Book of Thel reverses a genuine celebration of innocence; the Songs of Innocence, despite all the weeping, lack irony; a sudden advance over this self- sufficient pastoral vision is found in The Marriage of Heaven and</page><page sequence="6">642 RECENT STUD)IES Hell, though it dates from the same period. Such criticism could be expanded for pages, and undoubtedly will be, since Blake scholars do not take such matters lightly. It is the large argument that is the problem: Blake's aesthetic in the 1790's-a development of neoclassical techniques-contradicts his anti-rational ideology, but after 1805, when he discovered the "human form divine"-a phrase we if not the author, may recall from the Songs of Innocence fifteen years before-he could reconcile the two. This inveterate thesis, though supported by some excellent art history, is Blake criticism as "doing one's thing." Worse than untrustworthy, it is pernicious, and Blake would have been the first to say so. The most lavish Blake book of the year is William Blake: Essays in Honour of Sir Geoffrey Keynes (Clarendon), edited by Morton Paley of Berkeley and Michael Phillips of Edinburgh. The Anglo- American editorial alliance is manifested throughout the volume, a healthy sign even if the results are uneven. Three essays stand out as exemplary in methodology and suggestiveness: Paley contrasts Blake's apocalyptic with the brilliantly documented chiliast movements surrounding Richard Brothers and Joanna Southcote; Jean Hagstrum, fusing art history and literary sophistication with a humane eloquence that could convert the infidels, studies Blake's in- sistence on "Christ's Body"; and David Erdman, with Tom Dargan and Marlene Deverell-Van Meter, conducts a plate-by-plate examina- tion of the designs to The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, imbuing the slightest squib with life. Michael Phillips' important essay on the allusive nature of the Poetical Sketches precedes fine work on the ear- ly iconography by David Bindman and Robert Essick, whose con- cerns dominate a number of later pieces as well. Such a volume is bound to have its slighter essays, but the major disappointments are, ironically, the three essays contributed by English critics of stature: John Beer stretches correspondences and obliterates distinctions in lumping together Blake, Wordsworth, and Coleridge in the 1790's; G. Wilson Knight, with blithe self-congratulation, misreads "The Chapel of Gold"; and F. R. Leavis pushes to the forefront of Blake critics, by whom he appears to mean T. S. Eliot, propounding a view of Blake a generation out of date. To demand that a student "be told unequivocally that none of the elaborated prophetic works is a successful work of art" is not only Eliotic and silly, but runs counter to the humane and catholic sensibility of the man this book honors. A little noted but important tool for the study of Blake's art was also published this last year: Robert N. Essick's compilation of essays, The Visionary Hand: Essays for the Study of William Blake's Art and Aesthetics (Los Angeles, Hennessey gc Ingalls). The first of two sec-</page><page sequence="7">STUART CURRAN 643 tions gathers contemporary accounts of relief etching of the type Blake used, buttressing Ruthven Todd's seminal treatment of his techniques. The second brings together a number of important studies of Blake's artistic milieu, his techniques, strategies, and iconography. As Blake studies advance in sophisticated understand- ing of Blake's composite art, such a synthesis as this is both welcome and useful. There are 164 illustrations. In turning to Wordsworth, we find the year dominated once more by a major edition. Nearly a century has elapsed since Alexander Grosart first brought together Wordsworth's printed prose, accom- panied with the barest of illustrations, and dedicated the lot to Vic- toria. Nothing could be further from the long-awaited, three-volume set, The Prose Works of William Wordsworth, edited by W. J. B. Owen and Jane Worthington Smyser (Clarendon), a truly standard edition mounted upon thoughtfully conceived and meticulously exe- cuted textual principles and adorned with pages of learned commen- tary. Letters are excluded, since elsewhere easily available; also ex- cluded, and this is probably unfortunate, are Wordsworth's marginalia. But otherwise the edition is wholly laudable, adding to the standard classics a number of new fragments and several impor- tant pieces only available in Professor Owen's earlier publications. Especially noteworthy are the "Preface to the Lyrical Ballads," with the texts of 1800 and 1850 on facing pages and other variants printed below, a happy solution to what otherwise would have been a crabbed text, that and the commentaries to A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff (Smyser) and The Convention of Cintra (Owen), whose ample use of contemporary pamphlets and newspapers constitutes major historical research. This is an edition made to last as long as Grosart's, and all scholars of the period will be grateful. It is of some value for Wordsworth scholarship to have the record of his reading gathered from the many sources that document it. This Ronald B. Hearn has done in The Road to Rydal Mount: A Survey of William Wordsworth's Reading (Salzburg). After briefly surveying the authors, Hearn follows Wordsworth's comments on other writers in painstaking detail. If the account is intrinsically boring, it is still the substantial contribution of the book. The bulk of the study that follows is even more soporific: nearly two hundred pages of verbal echoes, historical sources, and the like, often presented with little attention either to significance or date, and, like all these Salzburg Studies, inaccessible by index. Wordsworth's development from a blase' Cambridge un- dergraduate to a great poet during the 1790's is of perpetual fascina- tion, and one supposes we will never be without a new theory for this</page><page sequence="8">644 RECENT STUDIES remarkable growth. Leslie F. Chard, in Dissenting Re- publican: Wordsworth's Early Life and Thought in Their Political Context (Mouton), attributes his awakening to his contacts with in- tellectual Dissenters. Chard notes how little evidence there is for the influences suggested by others-that of Rousseau, for instance-but faces a like problem with his own thesis, since there is simply little evidence of any kind. Chard sees Joseph Johnson, who published Descriptive Skatches and An Evening Walk as well as the works of leading Dissenters, as the key; yet it would seem curious that no member of the Johnson discussion circle should have recalled Wordsworth's presence when within the decade he became a major poet. By and large this is a traditional book in its approach to Wordsworth's ideas, attempting on the one hand to prescribe an exact source for the concept of benevolence that is ubiquitous at the end of the Enlightenment, but on the other hand never discriminating the available strains of Dissent except to note that the Johnson circle was largely Unitarian. Had they been Pietists, it might have been more to the point. The single critical study of Wordsworth, and one Inot to be ignored though published in an out-of-the-way form, is Lee M. Johnson's Wordsworth and the Sonnet (Copenhagen, Anglistica). One can assert without equivocation that this is the finest study of its subject. Johnson sees the sonnet as uniquely suited to Wordsworthian com- pression, fostering a union of low and high, particularity and exten- sion, "the wisdom of the heart and the grandeur of the imagination." Moving from the great early sonnets in which Wordsworth recast the Miltonic model-his patterns, themes, energy-into the "intense tranquillity" of his maturity with its major sequences, The River Duddon and Ecclesiastical Sonnets, Johnson traces commanding metaphors and concerns, exemplifies the spherical form that Wordsworth sought, illuminates individual masterpieces by placing them within larger contexts. All of this is done with an active in- telligence and a measured, thoughtful style reminiscent of the poet himself. He is particularly strongon demonstrating correspondences of form and content, nowhere more aptly than when with a certain bravura he pauses in his discussion of Wordsworth's flat sequence on church history to offer a reading of the great "Mutability" sonnet that has recognizably classic stature. Valuable editorial projects also distinguish work on the second generation of Romantics this year. One singles out with unalloyed delight the first two volumes of Byron's Letters and Journals edited by Leslie Marchand (Harvard) despite their sensational subtitles, "In My Hot Youth" and "Famous in My Time." Marchand brings to his</page><page sequence="9">STUART CURRAN 645 duties a commanding knowledge, represented in chastely informative notes, and a modest respect for Byron's words. Purists might wish for more exact information-the address of correspondents, provenance, and the like-and all readers would have been more fortunate had today's publishing exigencies not excluded Byron's respondents from these volumes. Still, one can always return to the long notes of the Coleridge edition, here replaced by twice the number of letters Coleridge printed. Marchand also supplies the lacunae deleted through Coleridge's hyperactive sense of propriety. For the first time a reader fully and directly confronts Byron's extraordinary personali- ty and career: the imperiousness is here with the charm, the tactful wooing of literary lights along with the impulse to divorce them all in satire, the lusty scramble with Greek schoolboys as well as the sequen- tial adultery with Lady Caroline Lamb and Lady Oxford. Just as Byron criticism is seriously probing his profound art, the personality is resurrected with renewed force. In these latter days, perhaps, we can accommodate the exhilaration of both. There are five Salzburg Studies of Byron this year, all with con- siderable weaknesses, and it would be best if they were dealt with together. Byron: The Critical Voice is assembled in two volumes by Bruce Wallis and purports to gather all of Byron's critical statements from the poetry, letters, conversations, and contemporary accounts. But despite elaborate cross-referencing, one would never know from looking under "Dryden" that he was celebrated as a master in the Don Juan decalogue, nor by consulting "Southey" that he was rhymed with "mouthy." Milton is similarly hard to locate completely, partly because Byron's views are truncated, partly because they are not represented; Hazlitt's account of Byron on Milton is apparently un- known to Wallis. One is surprised that Byron's few formal reviews are not reproduced completely, and even more so to find no allusion to the curious dialogue, "Byron and Shelley on the Character of Hamlet," printed in 1832. The critical studies of Byron out of Salz- burg are equally untrustworthy. Jane Kirchner's The Function of the Persona in the Poetry of Byron, which cites no source after 1964, treats its chestnut with ample paraphrase of the verse and little sense of the poetry. When Byron, after great effort, transcends the overwhelming pessimism he arrays, as in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and The La- ment of Tasso, his vision is said to be darkest. We are told that the per- sona who controls the delicate tonalities of The Vision of Judgment is "sketchily drawn" and "unimportant." Critically unreliable, neither does this study confront the impact of Byron's use of the persona on subsequent English poetry. The Style of Lord Byron's Plays by Paulino M. Lim is more valuable, but uses a fuzzy methodology of</page><page sequence="10">646 RECENT S TUDIES "stylistics" to conceal simple subjective biases. In singling out one rhetorical scheme for each play, Lim imposes a narrow stricture on Byron's multi-valent concerns. Herman M. Ward, in Byron and the Magazines, 1806-1824, generally elucidates the commonplace, that Byron was affected by his reviews. He is most original in showing how Byron's early poetry reflected-and incorporated- the criticism; but with the later career, where Byron stood down nearly the entire literary establishment, he has little to contribute except a sense of the running complexity of the battle. It is appropriately ironic that the editor of the Salzburg series, James Hogg, should take the opportuni- ty of a particularly short (72pp.) and useless publication, Charles J. Clancy's Review of Don Juan Criticism: 1900 to 1973, to add a preface expatiating on the value of reprinting doctoral dissertations. The statement is defensive and self-serving: although the Review is indefensible, it is likewise self-serving, since any responsible critic should know the drift of Don Juan criticism, be aware of more than Clancy's twenty-one items, and, one surely hopes, be capable of representing others' views more accurately and with less fatuous com- mentary. Shelley studies also profit from the wave of editorial work this year. Volumes 5 and 6 of Shelley and His Circle, 1773-1822 (Harvard), un- der the editorship of Donald H. Reiman, continue the high standards of scholarship and textual fidelity that Kenneth Cameron established in the first four volumes. With the period of November 1816 to the end of 1819, whose midpoint was Shelley's departure for Italy, one comes to the poet's maturity; and the meticulously detailed commen- taries will be of vital service to future scholars. Reiman's essays on the composition of The Revolt of Islam and on the relationship of Keats and Shelley surpass earlier studies, and his examination of Shelley's changing attitudes toward love-"On Love" is here dated precisely- and towards politics are judicious and commanding. The latter dis- cussion accompanies the one major textual contribution, an exact transcription of the neglected fragment, A Philosophical View of Reform, Shelley's longest prose work. Unfortunately, such raw puri- ty, though it demonstrates the inaccuracies of previous editors, results in a nearly unreadable discourse rather than a newly edited version. Reiman carries the heavy load for most of the 1200 pages, but there is an eloquent condensation of her earlier work on Trelawny by R. Glynn Grylls and, of significance for cultural history, a fine essay on the East India Office of 1819 by the late Sylva Norman, "Peacock in Leadenhall Street." There are two exceptions to the low caliber of the Salzburg studies among the Shelley books of the year. Fanny Delisle is responsible for</page><page sequence="11">ST UART CURRAN 647 an important and distinguished contribution to Shelley studies and to critical theory in A Study of Shelley's A Defence of Poetry: A Tex- tual and Critical Evaluation (2 vols.). This edition resurrects Shelley's actual copy text, with variants noted below, and follows it with a variorum commentary of 450 pages, emphasizing echoes from other Shelley works and from major sources of his ideas that earlier commentary has neglected. Also significant is William H. Hildebrand's Shelley's Polar Paradise: A Reading of Prometheus Unbound, an explication de texte with evident limitations. Hildebrand's reading lacks in- disputable historical contexts-in myth, in genre, in literary history, in science: the title, for instance, is drawn from Coleridgian notions of polarity, whereas Shelley knew not only those notions but the authors from whom Coleridge himself derived them. Similarly, though Jung can be of relevance to Shelley, the poet knew those traditions of mythography Jung fused with psychological theory. More seriously, one finds oneself questioning a number of the con- ceptual frameworks into which Hildebrand fits the drama: a skeptic like Shelley would distrust these accents on mysticism and mystery, as well as the overly doctrinaire application of polarity. But, after such caveats are entered, Hildebrand remains an eloquent and subtle critic whose fixed attention to the symbolism, the grammar, and the dramatic development are continually illuminating. Indeed, a number of passages are plumbed to such depth as to offer the most sensitive interpretation in print. Whatever its limitations, a book like this should not be lost in the shuffle. Less modest in size (669 pages) and in publisher's pretensions ("definitive") is Kenneth Neill Cameron's Shelley: The Golden Years (Harvard), which covers the poet's life and works from 1814 to 1822. With The Young Shelley and his numerous articles Cameron long ago established himself as Shelley's major historical critic of this generation, and that approach is maintained through this book. Dividing the landscape into three parts-the biography, the prose, and the poetry-Cameron is particularly impressive with the first two. His portrait of Shelley combines sympathy and common sense, though it also becomes somewhat defensive through concentrating on-and handily dissipating-the more sensational attacks on the poet. With the prose and especially the political writings, Cameron's detailed knowledge of the period allows a shrewd analysis of Shelley's political proposals and allegiances. This, one is tempted to say, is the most compelling treatment of this side of Shelley yet written. So in- tense a historical commitment, however, has concomitant short- comings, and often the commentary on the poems suffers from the</page><page sequence="12">648 RECENT ST UDIES urge, biographical as well as historical, to discover a solid, extrinsic ground for interpretation. An entire section is devoted to what, were Cameron's views accepted, could in all honesty only be regarded as snide, distasteful attacks on Mary's failings as wife and lover: Cameron seems curiously oblivious to how this contradicts the sensible biographical portrait he earlier framed. The basic approach is the problem, for Cameron's discomfort with this trailblazer of sym- bolism is evident where he is left without topical support and simply paraphrases. Romantics scholarship, however, is large enough to contain multitudes, and if others extract the ore of symbols with which Shelley loaded many rifts, Cameron's traditional historical ap- proach reminds us how much and how distinguished a part of his time Shelley was. Wilfrid Converse Barton's Shelley and the New Criticism: The Anatomy of a Critical Misvaluation (Salzburg), an old-fashioned book with no reference under a decade past, beats a dead horse with a sprig where there is a sapling to hand, namely the New Critics' consis- tent inability to see either the subtlety of Shelley's imagery or the basis of their own aesthetic in Romantic theory. The author tends to give up more ground than he ought, but then it hardly matters since the debate has been won. For admirers of stupidity, this book quotes reams of it. Another important edition must here be intruded upon the review, though it involves fiction: James Rieger's recreation of the revised first edition of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (Bobbs-Merrill). Rieger incorporates the emendations Mary included in a copy of the first edi- tion presented to her friend Mrs. Thomas in 1823, insisting that the standard third edition published with heavy revision in 1831 represents a decline from the purity of the original. There is much to be said for his position, especially since all variants are noted, for the text of 1818 is less melodramatic and less philosophically ambiguous and the three-volume structure has great clarity. This Rieger at- tributes to the strong influence of Shelley himself, and the most provocative aspect of this edition is Rieger's speculation, based on careful examination of the manuscript, that Shelley contributed so signally to the work as to make it almost a collaboration. For those teachers who wish to stress Frankenstein as Romantic fiction, this edition, available in paperback, is most valuable. Tall and self-possessed, "Never did a more finished gentleman than Shelley step across a drawing-room," said Byron. Keats, in contrast, was short and a cockney, and if his height may have been responsible for his acute understanding of embarrassment, as Christopher Ricks claims in Keats and Embarrassment (Clarendon), surely class-</page><page sequence="13">STUART CUKRRAN 649 consciousness was also involved. To Ricks Keats is distinguished by the open vulnerability of his "unchariest muse," the consciousness of embarrassment but refusal to succumb to it that allowed him to pur- sue sensation beyond established perimeters of taste-so, "Those lips, 0 slippery blisses." Ricks once more demonstrates his critical percep- tiveness and persuasive rhetorical gifts, defending, say, the lips, that "poesied with hers in dewy rhyme" against his readers' overly rigid canons of taste. Such maneuverings are a bit precious, as is Ricks's evident desire to record every blush in Keats and many others besides because blushing is characteristically "honourable"; we are to celebrate his "honourable hedonism" as if it were one of Prince Albert's virtues. There is certainly something refreshing about a book that so blissfully defends Keats's worst cockney excesses, as there might be about a panegyric to Rubens as the high mark of European painting, but for all the sophistry about metaphors of conception and pregnancy Byron's curt dismissal of an onanistic poetry remains in the mind. One is left with the suspicion that to be openly em- barrassing is rather like being honestly self-indulgent, a characteristic shared at times by subject and author: 'No one would deny that Keats was preoccupied with breasts and that sometimes he could not think in their vicinity." Said without a blush! Harry R. Beaudry's The English Theatre and John Keats (Salz- burg) is more serious and less entertaining. Keats is arguably the worst playwright (even including Blake) of the Romantic poets, and, though it may be interesting to notice where Keats borrows to uphold the sagging structure of Brown's plot for Otho the Great, it is of rather small moment. Beaudry's suggestion that Keats also borrowed from the likes of Milman's Fazio for his own poetry seems greatly stretched. the real value of this book lies in its long sections on Regency theater, and the ample research that the notes document includes much ephemeral information-a list of minor theaters open in 1819, or the receipts, profits and losses of the major theaters of the time-which other scholars can use. Critical surveys have recently been proliferating like Victorian families-one supposes in a well-intentioned effort to consolidate our exploding knowledge. lTheodore Redpath's survey of contem- porary criticism of Byron, Shelley, and Keats- The Young Roman- tics and Critical Opinion 1807-1824 (St. Martin's)-crosses the steps of the Routledge Critical Heritage volumes on Byron by Rutherford and on Keats by Matthews, as well as J. 0. Hayden's recent Romantic Bards and British Reviewers, as he testifies in his preface. All are superseded by the massive and nearly complete collections, The Romantics Reviewed, edited by Donald Reiman (9 vols.), and</page><page sequence="14">650 RECENT STUDIES Literary Reviews in British Periodicals, 1798-1820, edited by William Ward (2 vols.), both published by Garland in 1972. But few scholars will invest in the last two, and Redpath's limited focus allows him greater coverage than a more complete survey would afford. Analysis of the positions of some seventeen journals precedes the reviews themselves, whose selection is good though perhaps too limited by the format. One could argue, for instance, that the vicious tone of Shelley criticism was inaugurated in the Quarterly's denunciation of Leigh Hunt's Foliage, which finds no place in such a volume. Though the editor claims to have presented nearly all the Keats reviews, there are twice as many of the Lamia volume discussed by Tsokan Huang in The Magazine Reviews of Keats's Lamia Volume (1820) (Salzburg), along with the customary sorting-out of jour- nalistic prejudices. Redpath does provide all that really matters. Howard Mumford Jones comes as close as America gets to being an institutional humanist, with an engaging mind, wide knowledge, and ideas on nearly everything. One need only look at the index to Revolution and Romanticism (Harvard) to realize the special sort of exhilaration he is capable of producing, for he appears to have read most of the books written in Europe between 1770 and 1830, looked at all the paintings, listened to all the music, and he brings his authors together with style and familiarity. The effect is a little like a Truman Capote party, where the guests may not know one another but can be certain that each has done something terribly smart. Gawking at the guests makes for enjoyable reading, if not the most reliable history. Jones sees individualism at the core of Romanticism, hardly a novel theory, as at the core of this historical setting; and not even Carlyle's view of the French Revolution depends so thoroughly on per- sonalities. Yet in a curious way we are invited to see them all as enigmas, oddities. The bravura display has a refined patina, but little depth. Literary interpretations are invariably distorted through shallow readings, so that Kubla Khan and Alastor are yoked together as escapist visions. Preceding a conventional quick tour through The Prelude, Jones happily notes, "No two specialists quite agree on the interpretation of The Prelude; the discussion in the text may be a poor thing but it is at least mine own." Most educators will detect the tone of undergraduate Romanticism-with a flair. "At least mine own" serves to introduce Studies in Relevance: Romantic and Victorian Writers in 1972 (Salzburg), which allows us a convenient transition into the Victorian period without much else. Such superficial studies, skimming an author, ig- norant of his contexts, of history, and of philosophv, are by their nature irrelevant. Nonetheless the dilemmas of the nineteenth cen-</page><page sequence="15">STUART CLURRAN 651 tury continue to pervade modern civilization, as many of this year's books on Victorian poetry and prose exemplify without fanfare. John D. Rosenberg's brief but pointed book, The Fall of Camelot: A Study of Tennyson's "Idylls of the King" (Harvard), is intent on reestablishing the reputation both of the author and of his longest poem. Rosenberg's experience with this work shows in his seemingly effortless insight into its strategies and themes. He emphasizes an art of inwrought symbolism, where landscape lends depth to characterization, and complex parallels among the idylls draw one out of temporal progression even as they reinforce its tragic ramifications. The author insists that this is not a simple moral poem, but rather an exploration of the ambiguities of morality and of the insuperable difficulties of maintaining a balance even if, like Arthur, one presumes to have discovered one. The commentary is constantly illuminating, even in those instances where, as in Rosenberg's terming "Gareth and Lynette" a burlesque, there is con- siderable room for argument. Persuasive in his claims for the detailed art of the Idylls, Rosenberg is less strong in dealing with larger meanings and world view, which he takes little time to test. And it should be apparent that regaining Tennyson his rightful place will not be accomplished by such rhetorical indulgence as we meet with on the first page. There Tennyson is called "the greatest poet of the nineteenth century" and the Idylls "one of the four or five in- disputably great long poems in our language." Despite hyperbole and defensiveness, this is a book of intelligence and perceptiveness. Fitting one's subject to the format of a general series is never easy, and F. E. L. Priestley's Language and Structure in Tennyson's Poetry for the Language Library (Andre Deutsch) suggests the pull of con- trary impulses even by its title. Beginning with the purpose of obser- ving Tennyson's experiments with traditional forms, it soon ap- proximates a survey that emphasizes technical details, and it ends with unconvincing chapters on Tennyson's attempts to mold language to subtle philosophical expressiveness (if such terms apply to the nebulousness of the late poetry Priestley cites). The study is at its best in showing specifically how Tennyson's mastery of metrics, accent, quantity, and sonic effects infuses even minor poems with life, and how with a major work like In Memoriam it can change the very nature of octosyllabic verse. But Priestley's very real abilities in prosody can blind him to Tennyson's other strengths. With Mariana he is so intent on prosodic effects that he does not realize that Ten- nyson's greatest experimentation is with a dense imagery of psy- chological projection by which he effects something of a revolution in English poetry.</page><page sequence="16">652 RECENT STUDIES Some books are more significant for their approach to a subject than for their actual conclusions, and such is the case with William E. Harrold's The Variance and the Unity: A Study of the Complemen- tary Poems of Robert Browning (Ohio University), which presents a new and indisputably valid way of looking at most of the Browning canon but ends with strengths that are more rhetorical than substan- tial. Harrold's thesis is that, beginning early in his career, Browning conceived of many of his poems not in isolation but in relation to one or more other poems. From a simple coupling of ironic viewpoints Browning progresses to experimenting with the multiple voices of Pippa Passes, and then on to the richly complex structure of perspec- tives in The Ring and the Book. Harrold is a discerning reader, as can be seen in the many original insights he gathers from "My Last Duchess" and "Count Gismond" by treating them under the original combined title, Italy and France. And in suggesting the importance of the conventions of the Victorian diorama and the Italian commedia dell' arte to The Ring and the Book, he demonstrates a shrewd awareness of contexts. But the book continually betrays its origins as a dissertation, in ingenuous statements about other poets, or in the hackneyed use of intellectual constructions, like the Apollonian-Dionysian dichotomy he finds in the late Parleyings. Even at its most penetrating, the analysis reads like a barely developed outline, as if Harrold had pushed a button and received a computer printout. It is little tribute to the artistry of Browning's greatest poem to divide its characters into "pro-Guido" and "pro-Pompilia" fac- tions. Such weaknesses in exposition present a considerable barrier to the success of Harrold's main thesis, and to others must be left the task of working out its extensive ramifications. Since Browning's resurgence in modern criticism has been based on his understanding of psychological nuance and the complex ten- sions of experience, a reader may well approach with trepidation such a title as E. LeRoy Lawson's Very Sure of God: Religious Language in the Poetry of Robert Browning (Vanderbilt). Lawson's attempt to extract Browning's essential Christianity sees no change from Pauline and Paracelsus to the later poems on religious subjects. The author's own religious vocation gives him familiarity with numerous modern theologians whose ideas at times illuminate those of Brown- ing. It is probably true that Browning's religious ideas are formulated from an existential posture common among modern thinkers, but still one has Hardy's indictment with which to contend: a "smug Christian optimism worthy of a dissenting grocer." Hardy is himself smug, but like many a reader he finds Browning's illogical positivism hard to bear. Lawson, in clarifying Browning's views, does not lend</page><page sequence="17">STUART CLURRAN 653 them respectability. Browning begins alone, knowing hunger for an object of worship and thereby inducing God-or as Lawson honestly admits, his is "a subjective religious experience [that] is practically incommunicable and certainly rationally undemonstrable." Law- son, unlike many readers, does not seem disturbed by the poet's in- veterate urge to propound religious articles of belief (one think of the way centuries of schism are waved away in Saul by David's "All's love, yet all's law"). If one leaves the book respecting the author's exposi- tion, still it is with a renewed sense that Chesterton had his finger on the real problem, that Browning is disturbingly like those scoundrels whose monologues predicate solipsistic concepts of the cosmos to justify themselves. Lawson allows that Caliban Upon Setebos is a satire upon Darwinianism and anthropomorphism, but does not go on to suggest it as a satire upon Browning's own kind of religion. And the reader-at least this reader-is left where he began, unable to com- prehend how Browning could at once expose in his characters and tolerate in himself what Lawson aptly terms "a home-made God." A large collection of previously unpublished letters between Elizabeth Barrett Browning and a close friend has been ably edited by Peter N. Heydon and Philip Kelley: Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Letters to Mrs. David Ogilvy, 1849-1861 (Quadrangle; Browning In- stitute). Although the editors use such epithets as "intimate" and "revealing," the thirty-nine letters could more fairly be described as chatty, effusive in their praise of Louis Napoleon and Italian liberty, cloying in their accounts of the spoiling of Pen Browning (whose curls provide a kind of thematic unity to the letters), remarkably reserved in alluding to the Brownings' writings. Literary interest is confined to some middling gossip, several sharp comments on Ten- nyson and Arnold, and an unnoted but, in its context, interesting quotation from Shelley in the thirty-first letter. In addition, the last of the letters, written shortly before Mrs. Browning's death, is austere- ly moving. Several appendices provide examples of Mrs. Ogilvy's own poems, which, despite the inevitable poses of an amateur, show modest distinction. Carl Dawson concludes his introduction to Matthew Arnold, the Poetry: The Critical Heritage (Routledge and Kegan Paul) by noting that implicit in his tracing of Arnold's changing reputation are near- ly all the attitudes of modern critics. It is a sound statement, testifying to the value of having such a representative collection of contem- porary notices. One wishes that there were more comments from beyond the formal reviews, but they provide obvious material for studying the tastes and the obsessions of the high Victorian age. A complementary volume is planned for the prose.</page><page sequence="18">654 RECENT STUDIES The second part of this review rightly begins with a most beautiful book, in its elegant design no less than in its abiding intelligence, Stuart Tave's Some Words of Jane Austen (Chicago). Eschewing footnotes and index, Tave is nonetheless highly conscious of past criticism and quietly sets himself against the niggling short- sightedness that has occasionally posed as originality among Austen critics. To his mind the novels convey a consistent moral vision of how common life can be made fulfilling, and he approaches it by con- sidering key concepts in them. The individual chapters, however, do not restrict their view to a single novel, but rather weave a web from the one to its fellows. With Northanger A bbey Tave stresses the artful and artless, as well as problems of observation; with Sense and Sen- sibility, not only the title concepts, but also candor and exertion; with Pride and Prejudice, the nature of amiability and of mortification; with Mansfield Park, the sources of liveliness and the impact of propriety; with Emma, imagination and elegance; and with Persua- sion, the art of listening. Governing the subtle flow of ideas through the novels, Tave suggests, is Austen's emphasis on exactness of defini- tion in life; the use of words is a moral index, and all choice depends on their nuances. To capture such nuances repeatedly is an estimable achievement. The wholeness of this interpretation allows greater room for Elinor Dashwood and Fanny Price to stand as heroines than more limited interpretations have; but such ends are incidental to the large achievement, which is, as Austen's critic, to have attained to the depth and the tough-minded delicacy of her vision. Tave's study carries the weight of a major statement that places less considered treatments of Austen in the shade. It is thus some credit to Jane Nardin that Those Elegant Decorums: The Concept of Proprie- ty in Jane Austen's Novels (State University of New York) manages to touch many of the same subjects with freshness. The book does have its weaknesses. The opening chapter, pompously entitled "How to Read Jane Austen," promises a treatment of the relationship between shifting narrative viewpoint and complex irony that never reappears. Instead our concern is with major and minor rules of propriety, roughly equivalent to morals and manners, from their rigid obser- vance by Elinor Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility to an implicit questioning of the efficacy of either in Persuasion. Along the way there is some confusion as to the novels' standards of decorum, as well as to the extent that artistic exigencies might account for the distinc- tions Nardin notes. The only serious failing, however, is that we seldom look deeply into the motives for observingor defying conven- tions, an area of behavior in which Austen could split more hairs than Henry James. Still, the book is often suggestive in its comparisons</page><page sequence="19">STUART CURRAN 655 between novels, and the final chapter on Persuasion is richly aware of its complexities. The extent and variety of writing on Jane Austen in the past two decades poses large problems for critics who wish to do adequate research, and her anomalous position in the Romantic period has deprived her of the bibliographical attention given her contem- poraries. There is consequently ample need for An Annotated Bibliography of Jane Austen Studies, 1952-19-72, compiled by Barry Roth and Joel Weinsheimer (Virginia). This bibliography is es- pecially useful because it is exemplary in its composition. Its three sections, chronologically arranged, list essays and books on Austen, then dissertations, then works in which Austen is treated with other authors. In the case of books, after noting the reviews, the editors dis- till the treatment of each novel in measured and scrupulously objec- tive prose. The wide-ranging coverage brings forward easily missed items like Eudora Welty's tribute to Austen's mastery. The index is organized according to author, novel, and major concept. To move from Jane Austen to a writer who conceives of riding fearlessly as a moral index is to suffer something of a fall. David R. Johnston-Jones in The Deathless Train: The Life and Work of Robert Smith Surtees (Salzburg) contributes a mindless enconium to an author whose chief fame, given the evidence he presents, is that Dickens managed to create Pickwick from the unpromising model of his sporting fiction. Perhaps Americans grow up with too strong a dose of Hemingway to find intrinsic virtue in hunting foxes. Surely there is something to be said for Surtees in literary history, perhaps even in the evolution of the middle classes, but it will not come from calling Jorrocks "Churchillian," nor from a level of discourse so bereft of sophistication: "It is impossible to like Mr. Sponge's other horse...." To say the least. Dickens' Sketches by Boz are slight affairs by any standard, but es- pecially in comparison to his later achievement. Virgil Grillo's Charles Dickens' Sketches by Boz: End in the Beginning (Colorado) accepts the inherent difficulties of treating such early work and by a sophisticated strategy triumphs over them. This is not, indeed, mere- ly a book about the Sketches, but about techniques and themes first developed there and how they became transformed in the mature art. Grillo's analysis of the periodical milieu into which Dickens inserted himself and his comparison of the young author with prominent humorists like Egan, Hook, and Hood allows him to account for Dickens' early success, as well as to suggest how the attempt to create a recognizable voice and stance led to later strengths and weaknesses. In particular, Grillo maintains that the sardonic stories and more com-</page><page sequence="20">656 RECENT STUDIES prehensive, accepting sketches of this collection prefigure the basic tension of Dickens' genius and the continuing paradoxes of his later art. Tables of composition, periodical distribution, and principles of grouping for the collected Sketches are very useful; but most readers will be happiest to find Grillo moving on to demonstrate a shrewd critical intelligence with lengthy consideration of the early novels. Perhaps he overemphasizes elements of contradiction, paradox, and undercutting parody in the later novels; but few will deny that these are essential elements of Dickens' genius, nor, after this book, that they were there from the first. Dickens' self-contradictions are treated without Grillo's sympathy in another book, which after the fete of the centenary rises like a voice from the wilderness to echo Santyana. John Carey's Here Comes Dickens: The Imagination of a Novelist (Schocken) is likely to prove painful both to the agnostics and the faithful. This Dickens is obsess- ed with violence, but has a mean-spirited passion for the fastidious; employs a humor that distances himself from compassion, but is bor- ing when serious; is hardly capable of a decorous symbolism; dis- criminates between children purely on a class basis; and is himself so sexually repressed that he produces perversions in his characters. The introduction suggests a concern with Dickens' greatness, not his claims as a social critic, which suggests that Carey's Oxford is casting yet another cold eye on Cambridge moralism. But to conceive of an imagination without art is to engage in a study of pathology. The book turns in upon itself, first denying Dickens a social vision, then questioning his artistic integrity: it is managed with an uncommon number of sneers and raised eyebrows, with much lifting from con- text and considerable suppression of evidence. Ironically, there is heavy moralism behind it all, as well as the implicit assumption that realism is the proper mode of fiction. When Carey notes the wastepaper blowing about the London of Our Mutual Friend, it is a reflection of Dickens' fastidiousness, not an example of symbolic elaboration. The policeman at the desk oblivious to the bangings of the drunken inmate in the fourth chapter of that novel is said to have Dickens' approval, of which there is no evidence. Dickens is similarly alleged to approve of Wemmick's castle, oblivious to its implications for the symbols of the novel. Who, it might be asked, wove that sym- bolism so as to make Carey so uncomfortable? After all the ink spilled over Great Expectations, one wonders how much education can be conferred on those who only write criticism, never read it. One turns with relief to the third volume of the Dickens Studies A n- nual (Southern Illinois), which generally deserves the praise its editor, Robert B. Partlow, ingenuously gives it in his introduction. It</page><page sequence="21">STUART CURRAN 657 contains a variety of critical approaches, most handled with dexterity and productive of original insight. Three essays stand out. Alan R. Burke follows out the architectural motif established both descrip- tively and professionally from the very beginning of Martin Chuzzlew it, tracing a remarkable number of interconnected threads, a few of which get broken from too much stretching. The central metaphor of the London in this novel, he suggests, is the Monument that celebrates its rebuilding after the Great Fire; it stands over the labyrinthine extensions of the House of Chuzzlewit rather than a community of civilized men. Analysis of similar imagistic and thematic reverberations reveals more of the extraordinary art of Our Mutual Friend in John H. Robson's rhetorical approach to the first number. From his commentary on the opening sentence to his con- cern with the prevalence of nick-names in the novel, he offers an enlightening experience. Concerned less with the art and more with the power of Dickens' societal conceptions, Anthony Winner con- tributes a mature and thoughtfully probing study of the enigmatic Jaggers. He treats him as a necessary but fallen providence who "em- bodies both law and the human cost of law" and whose keeping of dark secrets, himself the darkest, protects a threatened innocence like Pip's. Among other efforts are three continuing the reassessment of the once-neglected Little Dorrit. Anne Lohrli's title says almost all one needs to know: Household Words: A Weekly Journal, 1850-1859, Conducted by Charles Dickens-Table of Contents, List of Contributors and their Con- tributions, based on the Household Words Office Book in the Morris L. Parrish Collection of Victorian Writers, Princeton University Library (Toronto). Like the Wellesley Index to Victorian Periodicals, this is a further attempt to plumb the secret, anonymous recesses of periodical publication in the nineteenth century. Anne Lohrli's com- pilation adds greatly to our knowledge of how Dickens operated his periodical, who his associates were, and the like. One may rightly ask if we need to know so much about an ephemeral and superficial periodical; but here it is, elaborate in presentation and high in price, ready to be sifted by scholars with time-and generally minor writers-on their hands. Like many studies in linguistics, Norman Page's Speech in the English Novel (Longman, English Language Series No. 8) aspires to describe rather than prescribe. This leads to an inconclusiveness through much of the book, but one that grows on a reader as he begins to comprehend the problems faced by a writer of fictional dialogue and the innumerable solutions posed for them. Dickens is the central figure to whom the survey invariably returns, for he was "beyond ad-</page><page sequence="22">658 RECENT STUDIES miration" in his ability to create dialogue. The concluding chapter lengthily examines the ways in which Dickens fixed characters through speech patterns as well as the increasing reliance of his narrative on such patterns. Aside from its large linguistic purposes, the book offers a valuable statement on Dickens' style. Who's Who in Dickens, compiled by John Greaves (Taplinger) is intended for the audience of "addicts" mentioned in Margaret Lane's introduction. At times it might be serviceable to a pressed critic trying to recall the name of a supernumerary in, say, Pickwick. After a long alphabetical listing of vignettes, Greaves allows three pages for animals, and concludes with a cast for each novel. For what it is worth, The Tale of Two Cities has fewest characters (30), followed by Hard Times with 31; Pickwick, of course, has the most, though one would have thought that there were more than 227 citizens in that in- comparable nation. One does occasionally wonder what credentials are necessary for the pantheon. The non-existent Mrs. Harris is, of course, here, as she is a decided presence in Martin Chuzzlewit; her husband also gets on the list, but fame is denied her fascinating sister who carried her dead infant about her bottled in formaldehyde. At this point, one intrudes on a germane subject-who's what in Dickens-unfortunately ignored by such a book. One can easily argue the value of the Dickens compendium, but clearly we are in for a series, the next of which is Who's Who in Jane Austen and the Brontes, compiled by Glenda Leeming (Taplinger). There appears to be no convincing rationale for joining these writers or for presenting vitnettes of their relatively small casts of characters. One concedes a modest contribution to learning in acknowledging but one named animal in all of Jane Austen-a dog called Folly. Miriam Allott has handled the difficulties of presenting The Brontes: The Critical Heritage (Routledge and Kegan Paul) with balance and skill, resulting in a distinguished addition to other volumes in the series. Her long and judicious introduction holds the many notices of the Brontes' works in large perspective, dissipating established opinions about the early neglect of Emily. The reviews range from the earliest mentions of the Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell to the essays by Mrs. Humphrey Ward for the Haworth edi- tion at the end of the century. One expects, of course, to find George Henry Lewes, an early champion, represented, as well as the impor- tant essays by Swinburne and Stephen in 1877. Counterpointing the formal notices, however, is a wide selection of letters from contem- poraries like Lockhart, Thackeray, George Eliot, Arnold, and Rosset- ti-not to neglect the previously unpublished entries from Victoria's journal. These ably testify to how quickly and firmly the genius of the</page><page sequence="23">STUART CURRAN 659 Brontes' was established in the public eye. Readers should not be misled by the provocations of Charles Burkhart's title-Charlotte Bronte: A Psychosexual Study of Her Novels (Gollancz; Humanities)-to expect either a Freudian exegesis or a biographical expose. In truth, it follows the conventional pattern of a short introduction, with a biographical summary and chapters on each of the novels. The analysis is seldom penetrating, and suggestive ideas remain just that. In moving from Jane Eyre as adoles- cent art to Villette as mature art, Burkhart writes with the pointed style one might expect in a popular undergraduate lecture. What salacious interest he extracts would seem congenial to such an audience as well. Those who would like to credit Thackeray as a major novelist can take little comfort from J. A. Sutherland's Thackeray at Work (Athalone). Indeed, those who have thought him a second-rate talent may be inclined to drop him a notch. Sutherland's extensive applica- tion of the surprisingly few manuscript sources for Thackeray's novels continually undercuts his encomiums, suggesting a slipshod hack with almost no sense of structure or unity. Hampered by the demands of an exact chronology in Vanity Fair, Sutherland argues, Thackeray accidentally discovers his true metier by expanding the historical scale to dynastic proportions in which such limits can be avoided. Afterwards, he creates an art (if that is the proper term) characterized by the author as one of "facile improvisation." Past arguments tending to assert Thackeray's abilities are generally and perversely countered. Sutherland may be right, but he bases his un- consciously harsh assessment on dangerously little evidence. In mid-century, when Matthew Arnold suddenly bloomed into un- expected fame, his younger brother William was an unhappy, moody officer in the Bengal infantry who wrote to relieve his melancholy. His one novel-Oakfield; or, Fellowship in the East-was published during a sick-leave in England in 1853, and its reappearance in photo-facsimile, with a knowledgeable introduction by Kenneth Allott (Victorian Library, Leicester University Press; Humanities), should help to enlarge notions not only of this remarkable family, but of the great impact of the father, Dr. Arnold, on Victorian culture. Oakfield, described by E. M. Forster as a "strange, quixotic, dis- illusioned work," presents the darker side of Dr. Arnold's insistence on a high Christian ethic, for in the Colonial service Oakfield's Christianity brings him into constant conflict with his fellow Englishmen. Allott's introduction concentrates on the Rugby in- fluence on this novel, its importance as an index of Dr. Arnold's sway; but it is fair to say, too, that in the dislocation between ideals and</page><page sequence="24">660 RECENT STUDIES reality, Oakfield is an early representation of the dark side of British imperialism. The study of Lewis Carroll is entering an era of sophistication, if we are to see a harbinger in Kathleen Blake's scrupulous avoidance of psychoanalysis in Play, Games, and Sport: The Literary Works of Lewis Carroll (Cornell). Drawing heavily on psychological theories of play-in Huizinga's Homo Ludens, in Freud, in Piaget-Blake details and discriminates Carroll's obsession with games in his writing. The inventor of a number of games, Carroll invested all of his writings, from those on symbolic logic to those on Alice, with their principles. The study of A lice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass concentrates on the progression from cards to the more deterministic chess, with Alice seeking direction, attempting to learn others' rules, until she discovers her own. A final chapter, sur- veying the Victorian "gospel of amusement," makes use of much neglected historical material. The book is of value for approaching Carroll's art, though it is so historically bound that it seems unaware of later novelists' games which, like those of Nabokov and Borges, in- clude the reader as well as the fictional characters in their play. Perhaps Carroll does as well; certainly, his social satire, an element with almost no place in this study, leads him continually outside the patterns of his private game into a relationship with society's. A feminist criticism, though strongly championed by many, has been more of a felt need than a distinctive reality. Quietly and without applauding her own contribution, Vineta Colby has written a synoptic study of a large body of literature generally neglected by male critics: Yesterday's Woman: Domestic Realism in the English Novel (Princeton). Men play a minor role in Colby's book not because of an inverse prejudice, but because, in all truth, they played a minor role in effecting the great historical shift from the Scott romances to the Victorian bourgeois novel. This study makes no special pleas, but through an awesome familiarity with minor, if once popular, fiction demonstrates the feminization of the English novel during the first half of the nineteenth century. Chapters on the silver- fork school of Mrs. Gore, on the novels of education whose foremost practitioner was Maria Edgeworth, on the religious novels-both evangelical and high church-and on the realized ideal of domestic realism, what Colby terms "the novel of community," balance a re- fined taste with a sympathy for the aspirations of second-rate writers. The course of reading behind this study must often have been dreary, but Colby continually emphasizes the rewards to be had in the uneven terrain of Mrs. Gore, Susan Ferrier, Elizabeth Sewell, or Charlotte Yonge, these and many others. Without their experiments and their</page><page sequence="25">STUART CURRAN 661 establishment of conventions the high art of George Eliot could not have been achieved. Colby's treatment of educational novels suggests how deeply their traditions became ingrained in nineteenth-century fiction. It is thus surprising to realize that no full-scale account of the English Bildungsroman has existed before the publication of Jerome Hamilton Buckley's Season of Youth: The Bildungsroman from Dickens to Golding (Harvard). Following his cogent introduction that identifies the origins and components of the genre, Buckley offers chapters on Dickens, Meredith, Eliot, Butler, Pater, Hardy, and Wells, before moving into the modern period. Since Buckley works with classics, there is little room for the historical depth achieved by Colby, and since he writes an introduction to each of the novels he treats, his clarity and balance sacrifice something of the depth and the generic strategies in the novels. Future treatments of this subject will probably want to deal more fully with this genre as a developing form and with its excursions into other than realistic realms. But Buckley's is a solid and useful beginning. Arnold Weinstein prefaces his Vision and Response in Modern Fic- tion (Cornell) with a phenomenological manifesto that makes much of Susan Sontag's attack on interpretation. Having made his point, he then writes a fairly conventional interpretation of the development of fictional strategies from Balzac to Robbe-Grillet, from a novelist who enlightens mysteries to one who perpetrates them. The sections on the English nineteenth century show Dickens, Conrad, and Ford as increasingly conscious of how difficult it is to ascertain truth through the facets of appearance. James, as one might expect from such a progression, is the pivotal figure who complicates all aspects of the aesthetic vision and the reader's response. Beginning the third section of this review, one is delighted to report that the Modern Language Association has done something besides proliferate committees of late and, what is more, has done something never done before. David J. DeLaura is the general editor of Victorian Prose: A Guide to Research (MIA), designed as a companion to the already well-thumbed guides to poetry and fiction during this period. This is a massive volume that devotes 350 pages to Macaulay, the Carlyles, Newman, Mill, Ruskin, Arnold, and Pater, before branching out into discussions of minor writers in the Oxford Move- ment, other churchmen, the best-known critics, and a last group somewhat quaintly termed "the Unbelievers." Ranking scholars have been asked to do each of the sections, and, though one wishes to be saved recital of some of the more foolish controversies, they are in-</page><page sequence="26">662 RECENT STUDIES cluded with the crucial ones for the sake of an almost benumbing completeness. To cavil before such a volume is foolish; it is an achievement of real note. But one might question principles of exclu- sion, if not inclusion. Between the churchmen and the unbelievers could not a modest niche be found for Darwin, or for Marx? To some extent it is the anomalous position of Victorian prose that forces such a question, for the major figures are incomparable stylists and major forces in cultural history. In the latter guise they should not be isolated from others of comparable magnitude. What is included in this volume, however, is important enough to make it a very valuable reference tool. One who is not included, though his career overlaps the early Macaulay and Carlyle, is William Cobbett, the first true journalist of England and prime exponent of what today we rediscover under the rubric of "New Journalism." His inconsistencies, egotism, and tendency to flee across the Atlantic when the bailiff appeared at the door have encouraged arch condescension from sober historians, but the appearance of two separate books on the man suggests that an overdue obligation is at least being met. Gerald Duff's William Cobbett and the Politics of Earth (Salzburg) is a slight book, offering brief chapters testifying to the actual consistency of Cobbett's views on education, religion, history, and agricultural society, followed by a faltering, obligatory analysis of his prose style. Much of this short study is devoted to the self-evident, and consistency of view is often achieved at the expense of wholeness of vision or of personality. A man who spent the enormous energies of his life slaying such dragons as "that prime old prelate in petticoats, that choice tool of the borough-mongers, Hannah More" may be quixotic, but he deserves a lively intelligence and a modicum of style. Cobbett receives that-and much more-in the second study, James Sambrook's William Cobbett (Routledge and Kegan Paul), one of the Routledge Author Guides.. From this book, large in grasp, in wit, and in humanity, all future study of the man will proceed. Sambrook has added to the labor of his reading extensive research into the background and influence, and his biocritical approach achieves a perspective unattained by his predecessors. The opening chapter is wonderfully shrewd: without revealing his motives Sam- brook surveys agrarian society in 1760 to establish a realistic basis for almost all of Cobbett's ideals and prejudices. Bolingbroke, Swift, Pope, and Chatham attacked paper credit with equal zeal, and similar authority can be cited for Cobbett's dislike of tea and potatoes. Sam- brook's purpose throughout is to demonstrate how Cobbett "adapted to the revolutionary world of 1800 many of the notions of a Tory</page><page sequence="27">STUART CURRAN 663 squire of 1700 and in the process became, without any consciousness of inconsistency, a leader of industrial, working-class Radicalism." All of Cobbett's writings, from grammars to sermons to educational tracts, however disparate to a later time, had the same end in view: "If I wrote grammars, if I wrote on agriculture; if I sowed, planted, or dealt in seeds; whatever I did had first on view the destruction of in- famous tyrants." Sambrook's is a balanced portrait of the People's Romantic, "cantankerous, naive, unfair, preposterously conceited but innocently and splendidly responsive to the life of man in nature." The weakness of previous writing on Cobbett gives this author an opportunity that comes to few, and he fulfills it with dis- tinction. Jane Millgate's Macaulay (Routledge and Kegan Paul) also sustains the high standards of this series. Using many unpublished documents, Millgate emphasizes the writer over the man in a general- ly sympathetic survey of his career. She is especially perceptive in representing the elements of Macaulay's style as well as the deep- seated Whig progressiveness that continually manifests itself by bringing the past to bear on modern consciousness. If one is at times disappointed in the book, it is because there is much to be said on the other side, against Macaulay's refusal to consider the ideological assumptions of his historical writings, as against the frequent blindness of his Philistine values. As Macaulay specialized in historical portraits of the flawed, one might wish a portrait of the ar- tist that followed his example in this respect. Perhaps, though, with an author whose fortunes are at their lowest ebb, it is right that the vir- tues be accentuated. For many readers the defects will be obvious enough. Philip Rosenberg's reassessment of Carlyle's social vision, The Seventh Hero: Thomas Carlyle and the Theory of Radical Activism (Harvard) deserves the wide attention it has received. Although specialists may be put off by yet another dismissal of the writings after Past and Present and by the author's claims of being the first to cut through shibboleths often pierced before (though, admittedly, to lit- tle effect), this is a significant and potentially influential study. Rosenberg's considerable strength lies in a refined conception of ideology; again and again he pushes aside cant and simple categories to reveal the underlying assumptions and implications of Carlyle's thought-or in the ideas of his interpreters. Rosenberg has a capacious sense of intellectual history, coupled with a feeling for the wholeness of Carlyle's diverse interests. Where Carlyle seems somewhat foolish to a later time-in his faith in Captains of Industry or his inability to discern the logical implications of his ideas-</page><page sequence="28">664 RECENT STUDIES Rosenberg refuses to apologize. But his main effort is to demonstrate how cogent a challenge Carlyle posed to the growth of bourgeois liberalism, even where, as in Chartism, it masked itself as radicalism. His own radicalism, in this view, led him to an idea of revolutionary change that anticipates Kropotkin; and his distrust of democracy stems from the realization that the cash nexus had qualitatively transformed society beyond the point where tinkering within the system can have any meaningful effect. Carlyle's hero-worship, by which as Rosenberg emphasizes he means a society of heroes engaged in permanent revolution, may still disturb us, but with the evidence of present-day China before us, perhaps it should give us pause. Rosenberg, a revisionist historian who commands his materials with authority, fills such a pause with a sobering reassessment. From the period immediately following the death of Jane Welsh Carlyle in 1866 John Clubbe has drawn previously unprinted ex- amples of the introspection into which that severe blow plunged Carlyle. Two Reminiscences of Thomas Carlyle, Now First Publish- ed (Duke) illuminates and in some cases corrects the early biography. The most substantial of the two is in the form of extensive notes to Friedrich Althaus's article, "Thomas Carlyle, Eine biographisch- literarische Characteristik (1866)," which Carlyle considered the best such notice written. Clubbe translates Althaus's essay, providing Carlyle's commentary in different type, and adding his own extensive notes for both texts. The second reminiscence is a brief account of Adam Skirving, a Scottish farmer, and his artist son Archibald, the painter of Jane's mother's portrait. Clubbe's introductions place these disparate materials in admirable perspective. In Matthew Arnold, John Ruskin, and the Modern Temper (Ohio State), it is Edward Alexander's distinction to traverse old ground and rediscover it. It is a relevant book, in the finest sense, treating the am- bivalent claims of inner vision and public duty on two sensitive humanists. The comparative method allows us to see divergence within similarity, allows us, too, to feel the pull of historical events from complementary points of view. Treating a wide spectrum of the thought of these two men, Alexander complicates the often simple view of their attitudes, suggesting the irony of Ruskin's radicalism which would enforce rigid class distinctions as against Arnold's egalitarian liberalism, showing to what an extent Ruskin became a symbol to Arnold of inner tendencies he sought to stifle. In the end Ruskin's passionate involvement with social evil drove him mad, whereas Arnold's detachment preserved him and his cultural com- mitment from such a loss. Alexander is careful not to choose sides, and his balanced judgment lends weight to the maturity of the entire</page><page sequence="29">STUART CURRAN 665 discussion. The book's only fault, an essentially minor one, stems from the two writers having begun half a generation apart. Toward the beginning of his book Alexander has a tendency to hurry Ruskin along to bring him into proximity with Arnold. He was a major cultural force before Arnold scrawled his first verses, and a greater sense of how he came to that position would have strengthened the later chapters where the two square off as equals. Republication of the Autobiography and Letters of Mrs. Margaret Oliphant, with introduction, spare notes, and index by Q. D. Leavis (Victorian Library, Leicester University Press; Humanities), is a valuable service, for Mrs. Oliphant comes as close to being an all- around woman of letters as existed in nineteenth-century England. Q. D. Leavis' introduction is more a spirited defense than mere resume of the life and works. This position may lead to overstatement- "Miss Marjoribanks indeed has claims to be considered the wisest and wit- tiest of Victorian novels"-but is understandable. Her aim is to keep an author of such gifts from lapsing into obscurity. Surely a reprint of this sort is a step in the right direction. Before this survey moves into authors associated with the end of the century, we might pause to consider two books with ambitious sub- jects and manifest shortcomings. Half of Charles I. Glicksberg's The Sexual Revolution in Modern English Literature (Martinus Nijhoff) is devoted to nineteenth-century figures, all of whom are on the wrong side of the great shift in the Zeitgeist he wishes to celebrate. The accounts of Hardy, Moore, Shaw, and Wells, as well as the survey of earlier Victorians, mix synopsis with platitudes and discover Mrs. Grundy's presence everywhere. Like most cliches, Glicksberg's ver- sion of Victorian morality in literature, if pressed very far, would sinply collapse. But he never presses. So there still remains an im- portant book to be written on the other Victorians Marcus does not hit, beginning, say, with Tennyson and showing throughout the cen- tury the profound, if muted, treatment of sexuality it produced. The first part of David Craig's title, The Real Founda- tions: Literature and Social Change (Oxford) is to be taken strictly, for he is committed to social realism with a Marxist passion, and, if this collection of disparate essays has a common thesis, it is that realism, which disappeared in the seventeenth century, slowly rein- vigorates literature in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as socialist attitudes become more pronounced. The historical and quasi-literary essays of the book have a certain appeal: "Songs of the Bleak Age" resuscitates ballads of the early industrial age with in- sightful commentary and numerous musical scores, and the succeeding essay details the counter-educational system produced by</page><page sequence="30">666 RECENT STUDIES the British working class. It is beyond the scope of this review to deal with the latter part of the book where Craig once more harrows the defeatism of Eliot and heralds the socialism of Hugh MacDiarmid. The essays on nineteenth-century literature are the weakest part of the book, suffering from a twofold insularity. Surely someone outside the British Isles has a point or two to make about the cultural history which is Craig's subject. Indeed, there are American neo-Marxist critics who by their distance from the distinctive preoccupations of British socialism might have opened up the dialectic a bit. For Craig's nationalism is merely a reflection of his ideological narrowness. A sophisticated Marxist would not simply reiterate the customary lament over Dickens' failure to portray the working class accurately in Hard Times, but would investigate Dickens' strategies with his audience and perhaps even explore the novel, and Stephen Blackpool, as artistic expressions of a radical anarchy that is pained by the cost of industrial struggle to both sides. The famous estrangement between Robert Louis Stevenson and William Henley is of questionable interest today, now that both are solidly ensconsed in their second-rate reputations and biographicai brouhahas have an ancient must. There is thus a certain audacity in Edward H. Cohen's reopening the wounds in The Henley-Stevenson Quarrel (University of Florida Monographs). Cohen will not end all the speculation, but in recovering most of the correspondence that passed among the principles and their friends, he will give it an ac- curate basis. Cohen is judicious, and he tries to be impartial, but it is clear that his sympathies are with Henley, who in all objectivity had every right to wonder how Stevenson's wife had the gall to publish a story from the ideas of a mutual friend. Stevenson comes off as neurotically hyper-sensitive, his wife as a histrionic prig, and Henley as inclined to malicious gossip. One sympathizes with the isolated decency of Charles Baxter, who, acting as intermediary in the transcontinental fracas, wasted a quantity of time. Among the previously unpublished materials is a devastating portrait of Steven- son by Henley called "Ballade R. L. S." By itself it proves the value of this book. Since the first Nobel Prize for literature was not given until 1901, there would seem to be little point to including British Winners of the Nobel Literary Prize, edited by Walter E. Kidd (Oklahoma) in this review, except that two of the essays are on Kipling and Shaw. Faith G. Norris struggles to justify the award to Kipling with a weak-kneed defense. But the essay on Shaw by Edwin B. Petter, president emeritus of the New York Shaw Society, is of a different order. Urbane and elegant, equally at home with Shaw's social theories, his dramatic</page><page sequence="31">STUART CURRAN 667 structure, or his prose style, happily partisan but aware of the author's limitations, Pettet redeems a collection that would otherwise have seemed hack work. Although somewhat naive in supposing that any reader thinks of Shaw as merely funny, Alan P. Barr's emphasis on his quasi-religious seriousness-in Victorian Stage Pulpiteer: Bernard Shaw's Crusade (Georgia)-is an obvious corrective to such a view. It is, indeed, an almost relentlessly serious book, something of a crusade itself. Open- ing chapters on the religious crises of England and the milieu of Shaw's contemporaries in Ireland set the stage for what Barr con- ceives to be Shaw's wholesale attempt to save religion from itself. The result, of course, was Creative Evolution, which has had few dis- ciplies. Realizing this, Barr concentrates on the impulses behind Shaw's view, the clearness of his analysis, the humanitarianism of his motives, the originality of the artistic embodiment. Barr's concerns forcefully remind the reader that Shaw, if a modern iconoclast, has firm roots in the nineteenth century. The essays that concern nineteenth-century literary figures in Richard Ellmann's Golden Codgers: Biographical Speculations (Oxford) have mostly been published before; and since the book has received wide attention from reviewers, expatiation on its virtues is unnecessary here. The essay on Middlemarch shrewdly denominates J. W. Cross, Eliot's second husband, as the prototype for Will Ladislaw and speculates on the fantasy fulfillment in the novel. "Discovering Symbolism," for the most part new, concerns Symons early relations with the Rhymers and with Yeats. The major essays, however, are those on Wilde. "Overtures to Salome" persuasively argues that Ruskin and Pater as Wilde's Oxford mentors became transformed into the characters of his art, Basil Hallward and Lord Henry Wotton, Iokanaan and Salome. "The Critic as Artist as Wilde' intelligently focuses on the way Wilde's homosexual ex- periences color his understanding of the inherent subversiveness of art and of himself. Ellmann's essays will gain a wide audience. Though he uses the Ellmann pieces, Christopher S. Nassaar-Into the Demon Un- izerse: A Literary Exploration of Oscar Wilde (Yale)-seems not to have profited from their balance and perceptiveness. The introduc- tioni sets the tone with its preposterous assertion that Wilde developed a religion of evil, a point expanded into a thesis as the book goes on. The Picture of Dorian Gray is read as a study of art movements of the last half of the century. Sybil Vane becomes Tennyson through an ex- ercise of shallow misreading of his poetry; Basil becomes Rossetti; and, with Lord Henry as Pater, Dorian becomes the ideal decadent ar-</page><page sequence="32">668 RECENT STUDIES tist. Wilde? The obvious problem with this is that the cornerstones of decadent poetry Nassaar quotes in support of his identification were all published after The Picture. And, to say the least, the entire transformation of Wilde's powerful moral fable to this donnish level smacks of the ivory tower. Nassaar talks obsessively of evil with the indiscriminate fluency of one who has never experienced it. Salome is glossed as human nature which is glossed as evil: indeed, "the play absolutely reeks of evil." This Wilde is either a moral fool or a psy- chopath, neither of which was the case. To end with a book of the calibre of Paul Zeitlow's Moments of Vision: The Poetry of Thomas Hardy (Harvard) is appropriate, for it is the kind of book most readers might have wished themselves to have written. Not only is it intelligently faithful to the range of the author, but its testimony to the value of this large body of poetry is everywhere implicit and everywhere contagious. Zeitlow insists that we see more than a brooding pessimism in Hardy, that we balance it with the fre- quent Swiftian humor (where else does one find so many amusing depictions of God?), the realistic tenderness, the perception of mean- ing in the ordinary. He is also persuasive in his claim that Hardy saw each of his poems as a distinct, provisional statement and that he was less concerned with an overriding cosmic scheme than with the human consequences of imagining such a scheme. With our nine hundred poems to choose from, the author quietly excludes or barely mentions all the famous anthology pieces, which suggests how very good most of his canon is; and, though he occasionally impresses one as reaching for a last ripe peach to fill the bushel with, Zeitlow is adept at avoiding a mere survey. The author might have exercised a little less restraint, for the commentary implies some large claims for Hardy's art and for his place in the development of English poetry. If Zeitlow is not tempted to make them, it is certain that his readers will take the ample evidence he provides to a just conclusion. University of Pennsylvania</page></plain_text>
