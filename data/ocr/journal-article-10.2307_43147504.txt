Such anthropomor- phic descriptions, it is argued, pro- duce basic misconceptions that make it more difficult for teachers at upper levels to build on the con- ceptual foundation laid down in the lower grades. 1 Hughes, Austin. "Anthropomorphism, Tele- ology, Animism, and Personification." Science and Children 10:10-11; April 1973. We believe that the kind of pro- hibition against anthropomorphic formulation desired by Hughes and others who express his point of view is too sweeping in scope and needs to be limited in the light of recent findings about the psychology of young children. Post-Darwin Changes Historically, it was essential for Darwinists of the late Nineteenth Century to launch a concerted at- tack on the ingrained anthropomor- phism and personification which were a heavy part of pre-Darwinian thinking. That struggle must still continue at advanced levels of sci- ence education, but recent evidence reveals that there is a conceptual MARCH 1974 37</page><page sequence="2">At the preoperational stage ; anthropomorphic formulations are not only natural, but actually aid comprehension of the world a child observes. level for young children below which it is irrelevant, and perhaps counter- productive, to require that they ex- press themselves in the anti-anthro- pomorphic terms expected at more advanced levels. It may also be counterproductive to require teach- ers of young children and writers of books for this audience to avoid any hint of anthropomorphism and personification in their attempts to communicate ideas. Observations by Piaget Jean Piaget has shown that cog- nitive development of children passes through well-defined stages. The sensorimotor stage ranges from birth to approximately 18 months of age, the preoperational from ap- proximately 18 months through 7 years, the concrete operational from approximately 7 through 11 years and the formal operational stage (the adult, logical way of thinking) from approximately 11-12 years through 14-15 years.2 [There should be emphasis on approximately.'] Children in the lower primary grades are generally at the pre- operational or concrete operational stage of thinking. The preopera- tional is characterized by a high de- gree of egocentrism, personalization, and nonabstract thinking. For these children, anthropomorphic formula- tions are not only natural, but actu- ally aid comprehension of the world they observe. Even at the concrete operational stage the child's ability to deal with elementary groupings of classes and relations, so essential to logical thought, depends largely on interaction of sense perceptions with objects or phenomena. He proceeds from one step to another without necessarily linking or relating va- riables because he does not tend to act on verbally expressed hypothe- ses. Consequently, when a child encounters a concept expressed in language, to comprehend it, he re- quires that it be related to the body of concepts and feelings that are a part of his thinking, and these are often related to anthropomorphism and personification. One of Piageťs main findings is that the early stages of cognitive development depends on interaction with objects, animals, and people, especially one's peers.3 Experienced teachers have long known that chil- dren can readily relate to real or imagined feelings in animals and objects, whereas they generally have great difficulty in relating to or com- prehending feelings outside their realm of experience. Possibly young children will more readily learn about animals, or plants, or even about some properties of objects through personification and anthro- pomorphism. If this thesis is not a fact, let it at least be given the status of a reasonable hypothesis, on an equivalent level with the generally accepted hypothesis that anthropo- morphism is verboten. To illustrate the difficulties we encounter with absolute prohibitions against anthropomorphism, consider the situation of a dog who greets his young friend by running forward, vigorously wagging its tail and jump- ing up to kiss his friend's face. Not only the young child, but the average adult as well, will describe this be- havior by saying that the dog is "happy" to see his friend. But this is an anthropomorphic formulation which sees the dog's behavior in human terms. After all, nobody ever talked to a dog to find out if he really is happy in the same sense as a human being, or even to find out if dogs have their own ideas of hap- piness. The difficulty with prohibiting such an anthropomorphic formula- tion is that we are then hard put to describe the dog's behavior in any other simple way. If the child (or adult) says that the dog is "happy," shall we correct him by saying some- thing like: "No. The dog is not really happy. He is just responding in his characteristic doggy manner to seeing, once again, a familiar per- son with whom he has had pleasant associations in the past." How would writers or teachers who hope to be effective in communicating with chil- dren avoid the "natural" anthropo- morphic formulation? We think we know how others feel when they are happy because they act in the same manner as we do when we are happy. For further confirmation, they can describe their feelings to us. We can then judge whether or not the feeling of hap- piness for them is the same as (or similar to) ours. The child sees certain behavior in a dog which is initiated in a manner similar to what causes us to feel happy. The dog sees a good friend and greets him as we do. The dog may do it dif- ferently, with less reserve and with appropriate use of specialized body parts. Obviously the dog can't shake hands, or throw its arms around the friend. So the animal does the best it can with typical doggy limitations (and advantages) to communicate what seems to us like real pleasure in seeing a friend.

Don't use any anthropomorphic expressions. havior has so many basic elements that are similar to the kind of pleas- ure we feel when we see a good friend there is certainly good reason for the child or adult - and perhaps even ¿he scientist - to describe it with a reasonably available word: happy. The Semantic Problem The word "happy" is derived from observing human behavior, but there is no equivalent word for sim- ilar behavior observed in animals. Should we forbid the use of the word "happy" to describe animal be- havior? Must we then go through the whole recitation of character- istics each time we want to talk about it, which children (and many adults) will not understand? It is true that the word "happy" does not tell the whole story. What word does? Perhaps we could in- vent a new word as the equivalent of "happy behavior in animals." Ac- cording to Piaget, however, such language would be an artificial ac- commodation for the child who has not yet developed the logical struc- ture to enable him to assimilate this information. When a young person matures to the formal operational level, a teacher can extend the con- ceptual understanding of animal be- havior and find more specific ways to describe it. But teachers of younger children should avoid too- rigid, exact formulations for which the child is not conceptually ready. Calling attention to characteristics of living things that seem to be related to human feelings - using anthropomorphic formulations - may well motivate and stir interest in (rather than detract from) later study of animals and their modes of behavior. It is probably more useful for the teacher to be attuned to the child's individual cognitive level as mani- fested by his comments and re- sponses than to be overly concerned with the precise scientific formula- tion. With good teaching that is sensitive as well as sound, no dichotomy needs to exist. We make no plea to justify incor- rect teaching. All we are saying is that common sense and educational psychology should play a role in determining how we formulate con- cepts for young children. There are times and circumstances when an- thropomorphism will do no harm and may possibly do some good. What the anti-anthropomorphists should address themselves to are the circumstances under which an- thropomorphic formulations are de- sirable, tolerated, or prohibited. Basically, it is a problem of com- munication between disciplines. Teachers will have to listen to criti- cisms by biologists, but the biolo- gists are going to have to listen to teachers, too, and take into account basic educational psychology which they may often forget. Anthropomorphic descriptions are sometimes used by well-known sci- entists. Richard Feynman, Nobel laureate in physics, describes how he learned about science as a child in the following words: Incidentally, in the forest we learned other things. We would go for walks and see all the regular things, and talk about many things; about the growing plants, the struggle of the trees for light, how they try to get as high as they can, and to solve the problem of getting water higher than 35 or 40 feet, the little plants on the ground that look for the little bits of light that come through, all that growth, and so forth.4 Note the anthropomorphic use of such terms as "the struggle of the trees for light," "try to get as high as they can," "solve the problem of getting water," and "look for little bits of light." (And these are not even animals.) Darwin's study of the "Expres- sion of Emotions in Men and Ani- mals" uses such titles for sections as Affection, Joy, Contentment, Pain, Anger, Anxiety and Depression, As- tonishment, Terror, etc. Ethological studies sometimes use expressions for characteristics of human behavior in their study of animals. Purpose A considerable portion of Austin Hughes' article is devoted to discus- sion of inappropriate attributions of "purpose" in relation to animals. * Feynman, Richard.

Subsequently he would ar- rive at the friend's house vigorously wagging his tail, waiting for the car to round the bend. Can we really say that the dog did not have any purpose or intention in this obvi- ously intelligent behavior? The fact that the dog always dashed across the field instead of following the car and always came out ahead because of his action would seem to be some kind of evidence of purpose and intention. The blanket denial of purpose for animals may not be an inflexible absolute. Mr. Hughes has a stronger argu- ment when he comes to evolutionary considerations. He cites this ex- ample: "A hummingbird has a long bill so that it can reach into flowers and suck out nectar." He suggests instead the formulation, "The hum- mingbird uses its long bill to reach into flowers to feed on nectar." He objects to the first formulation be- cause it may be interpreted to as- cribe purpose to the process of acquiring the long beak. But does this really matter very much at an age level where the distinction is lost on the child whose correct interpre- tation of "adaptation" will only be learned at a much later age through his restructuring of perceptions, ob- servations, and conceptions? There is again a partly semantic problem in the interpretation of the phrase "so that." To a young child, the phrase "so that" may mean "enabling," "making it possible for" or "helping him to." For older chil- dren, Hughes may have a point; it may imply "purpose." There is also a change from "suck out" to "feed on," which may have the effect of only making it dull, rather than correcting a misinterpretation. We are dealing here with complex questions in which biology, seman- tics, psychology of child develop- ment, and pedagogy are all closely intertwined. Simply prohibiting an- thropomorphism from any teaching is an easy way out of the problem. Certainly, we need more discussion of formulation of concepts so that teachers may become expert in reconciling the needs of subject mat- ter in the light of what we know about child development and the usage of words. Faced with this dif- ficult, but not insurmountable, prob- lem, teachers who are trying to do their best need not feel paralyzed with guilt about errors they may commit; but rather may gain assur- ance in the knowledge that this is a two-way street and that the critics may be making errors too, at their end of it. Neither is entirely right or wrong, but both are essential. What good is a complicated, albeit correct, scientific statement if it turns a young student completely off to science forever?
