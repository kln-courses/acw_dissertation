<plain_text><page sequence="1">Faulkner's Favorite Word By John T. Flanagan IN overuse one sense would no dull author its effect can be and said nullify to have its a relevancy. favorite word, But there since overuse would dull its effect and nullify its relevancy. But there are words which because of their connotation or aura or single startling use seem inseparably linked with certain writers. Poe used "tintinnabula- tion" only once or twice, but who can forget its appearance in "The Bells?" The adjective "daedal" was a favorite with Shelley and seems to suggest him although it appears infrequently in his verse. Yeats' sages, "perne in a gyre," shock the reader of "Sailing to Byzantium" into immediate attention. To anyone even remotely familiar with transcendentalism the "oversoul" is Emerson's most compelling image. Spenser and Charles Lamb delighted in the archaisms which became their trademarks, and Swinburne chose words for their onomatopoeic rather than for their logical effect. The dramatic critic, Brooks Atkin- son, seeking to convey the rare excellence of a theatrical performance, spoke in occasional reviews of the "incandescence" of an actor or actress. Such words achieve greater impact because of their rarity. When they do appear, they are so unexpected and so emphatic that they linger in the mind long after the context has faded. It is a commonplace in the criticism of William Faulkner to under- score his fondness for Latinisms. Not only did he seem to exult in polysyllables and to fuse and merge and agglutinate adjectives; his feeling for rhetoric led him to juxtapose ornate and learned words in densely compact sentences. Not even Faulkner could frequently invent so plangent a clause as that which appears in section five of Absalom , Absalom1.: "I became all polymath love's androgynous advo- cate." Yet only a few pages earlier he could write: "his own clair- voyant will tempered to amoral evil's undeviating absolute by the black willing blood with which he had crossed it." Unusual words appear from time to time in Faulkner's fiction, like "uxory" and "peditation," and at least in his earlier work he seemed to imitate John Dos Passos's habit of telescoping or running words together. Thus Faulkner could write "cinderstrewnpacked compound" and in "The Bear" could use terms like "woodsface." Occasionally E 429]</page><page sequence="2">43Â° THE GEORGIA REVIEW too he took delight in combining opposites or in introducing paradoxes for their own sake, much as Henry Thoreau relished apparent contra- dictions. In "Mule in the Yard" Faulkner speaks of "unhasteful celerity," a term which would seem to defy all verbal logic whatever atmospheric value it might have; and in "Death Drag" with similar nonchalance he refers to "abrupt immobility." Faulkner liked to accumulate epithets until the noun which they supposedly modified quivered with the load. Sometimes they become one dominant impression, the adjectives building cumulatively to pro- duce the desired effect. Thus Ellen Coldfield, six years absent from the world, "is the foolish unreal voluble preserved woman" who is otherwise known as Thomas Sutpen's wife. Flem Snopes's tie is de- scribed in The Hamlet as "a tiny viciously depthless cryptically bal- anced splash like an enigmatic punctuation symbol against the expanse of white shirt." In the same novel Ratliff, sitting in a splint chair on a cabin porch, is depicted as "pleasant, affable, courteous, anecdotal, and impenetrable." The old general's batman in A Fable is "constant dur- able faithful and insubordinate and almost invisible," a descriptive crescendo which is helped by the deliberate lack of punctuation. On the other hand, Faulkner's epithets can also be so discrete or redundant as to blur the picture and leave the reader with an impression of mere verbiage. Faulkner's ear for the idiomatic language of the farmer and the town idler was excellent. Ratliff, Wash Jones, Lena Grove, the Bundren family speak naturally, clearly, and firmly. Consider the colloquial felicity of this passage from "Fox Hunt": The youth made a sound in his throat and nostrils. "A growed-up man. Hating a durn little old mangy fox. I be durn if it don't take a lot of trouble to be rich. I be durn if it don't." On the other hand, the language of Quentin Compson and Rosa Cold- field is understandably more complex and turgid. But in his earliest fiction Faulkner's control of language was definitely uncertain. In Soldiers' Pay he could be both the imitative romantic in describing a girl: "Her laugh was in three notes and she was like a swept tree"; and the rough realist in picturing Januarius Jones: "His yellow eyes washed over her warm and clear as urine." In Mosqmtoes the same man who could depict an inept young poet as the author of "an occasional</page><page sequence="3">faulkner's favorite word 43 i cerebral and obscure poem in four or seven lines reminding one some- how of the function of evacuation excruciatingly and incompletely performed" could also picture a young girl as "placid and rife." A room could resemble "a bathtub after the drain has been opened," while "a yacht was pure and passionless as a dream against the dark trees." Among the many qualities of Faulkner's rhetoric there is one special distinction: the novelist's obsessive liking for adjectives with strong negative impact. Sometimes he simply adds the suffix less : in addition to the common lifeless, tearless, nameless, voiceless, and sexless, there are the more unfamiliar climaxless, topless, destinationless, neckless, seethe- less, ancestryless, quenchless, markless, and dimensionless. Here cer- tainly Faulkner's disdain for the cliche led him to unfortunately awk- ward constructions. Even more common are epithets with the prefix un: unravished (with its echo of Keats), uncomplex, unplumbable, unsentient, unamazed, unrumored, unrational, unreverberating, unre- membering, unthreatening, and the extraordinary unratiocinative which is applied to Boon Hogganbeck. Most numerous are the adjectives beginning with in or im, less apparent for their originality perhaps than for their sheer quantity: inexplicable, indivisible, incorrigible, indomitable, indiscriminate, inscrutable, intractable, intransient, in- violable, inextricable, indefatigable, inevictable, inexpugnable, incalcula- ble; and impervious, immeasurable, impotent, impalpable, impregnable, impenetrable, immobile. It should be observed that Faulkner also occa- sionally employs litotes, that figure of speech so dear to Thomas Babington Macaulay- the expression of a strong positive by the nega- tive of its opposite. Of all the words in Faulkner's rich and saturated style none stands out more than the epithet implacable. It appears throughout the novel- ist's work, occasionally strained and almost unidiomatic, often natural and highly effective. In Faulkner's early writings it is more obvious and perhaps less in harmony with the context when it does appear; in his later work it is used with greater care and fitness. But implacable is a strong word, memorable for its impact even when its suitability is doubtful. The etymology of implacable is obvious, from the Latin adjective placabilis, from the verb placo or placare, to quiet, to soothe, to appease, to assuage, to reconcile. The negative prefix in the form favored by Faulkner suggests of course a meaning directly opposite to verbs of</page><page sequence="4">432 THE GEORGIA REVIEW propitiation. Normally one would think of the word in association with a person or with some powerful superhuman force. One would placate a person, or by anthropomorphic extension a deity, seldom an inanimate object. But Faulkner was rarely content with simple and literal meanings just as he scorned straightforward narrative technique. Playing with words as a musician would use notes in a fugue, he em- ployed implacable in many contexts where the strength of the adjective would seem to make it unsuitable, and he frequently extended the meaning to the figurative level. Anger, enmity, jealousy, hatred, as well as darkness, cold, heat, blood, and the earth could be implacable in Faulkner's lexicon. Even when the word appears among other adjectives it seems charged with special emotion and it carries unusual force. Some examples follow. In Mosquitoes a woman comes prowling along the corridor "im- placable and tactless as a minor disease." A man's straw hat was "a dull implacable gleam" above the glow of his cigarette. The fugitives from the ship on the Mississippi River quickly came to grief "crossing the implacable swamp." In "An Odor of Verbena" Drusilla is de- scribed as having a "close implacable head with its savagely cropped hair." Twice in "Red Leaves" the Indians who track down the fugitive Negro slave preparatory to sacrificing him to their dead Chief are described as waiting, patient, and implacable. Pylon, written some years later, reveals some rather striking exten- sions and applications. A passenger in a taxi watches "the implacable meterfigures compound." Light permeates a room with "an implacable infiltration which not even walls could stop." Again Faulkner refers to the "grim implacable faces of wives and aunts" and describes the mother of the dead aviator as having "faded eyes filled with an im- measurable and implacable unforgiving." In the torrent of rhetoric with which Requiem for a Nun begins the word is curiously absent although into one sentence of a dozen lines Faulkner manages to cram such negative epithets as invisible, insubstantial, impersonal, im- permeable, and incalculable. In the same novel he indulges in frequent alliterative phrasing, such as "invincible inviolable ineptitude" and similar expressions in which the sound often obscures the sense. In- truder in the Dust includes such a phrase as "that fluid and implacable attack."</page><page sequence="5">faulkner's favorite word 433 The Hamlet offers many examples of the use of implacable. The schoolteacher Labove attempts to attack Eula Varner after three years of unceasing combat with "his own implacable blood." Ike Snopes speaks to his bovine love "implacable and compelling." Houston and a childhood sweetheart are chained together not by love but "by im- placable constancy." Mink Snopes, after murdering Houston, strikes his wife across the mouth, not out of deliberate brutality but from "patiently indomitable and implacable weariness." And it is "implacable weariness" again which compels Mink to drive the woman away. The word is rarer in Absalom, Absalom! but perhaps more pertinent. Judith Sutpen is motivated by a "cold implacable antipathy." Thomas Sutpen's first wife, whom he put aside because of her Negro blood, had "parchment-colored skin and implacable pouched eyes." Quentin Compson could feel in Miss Rosa Coldfield "something fierce and implacable and dynamic driving down the old thin arms." And Rosa not only becomes later "the small furious grim implacable woman" but preserves in her innermost nature "some bitter and implacable reserve of undefeat." In the later novels implacable appears less frequently. A Fable, un- doubtedly Faulkner's most verbose and ornate story, recklessly piles up words in series and sequences until the style threatens to become completely otiose. But he replaces his favorite epithet with a variety of other adjectives. In the second and third volumes of the Snopes trilogy implacable is used but again inconspicuously. It is true that in The Alansion Faulkner speaks of the land as implacable and again employs the word in the phrase "the implacable rented ground." It would have been much more appropriate, incidentally, to refer im- placable to the dedicated vengeance which led Mink Snopes finally after forty years to carry out his plan of murdering his cousin Flem. But both in The Mansion and in The Reivers Faulkner's most charac- teristic tone is colloquial and idiomatic rather than literary. What the reader remembers from the final work is Faulkner's use of rustic folk speech: words like "fyce," "ginneys," "peckerwood," "croker-sack," "a blue-gum," "hoicking," "Whistle-britches," "pugnuckling," the old "pussel-gutted" sheriff, and the whole "passei" of Frenchman's Bend bucks. The infrequent appearance in the last books of what I have chosen</page><page sequence="6">434 THE GEORGIA REVIEW to call with some exaggeration Faulkner's favorite word is not surpris- ing. The heaviness, the dignity, the formality of the word seem more appropriate to stories in which the central figures are Thomas Sutpen, Quentin Compson, and Gail Hightower than in stories dealing with the Snopes tribe. Light in Augusty Absalom , Absalom !, A Fable are written in a rhetorical style which is peculiarly suitable to the com- plexity of the character relationships and to the carefully defined points of view. Moreover, since Faulkner often employs implacable in a figurative context it is more in harmony with fictions where narrative action is subordinated to elaborate analysis. The events of the later Snopes volumes and of The Reivers occur at the folk level where the tall tale, the rustic anecdote, and what might be termed Faulkner's twentieth century rural American adaptation of the mediaeval fabliau predominate. Faulkner, a consummate artist when he did not allow himself to be enmeshed in rhetoric, properly simplified his style in the folk chronicles. Toward the end of Mosquitoes Faulkner puts a speech into the mouth of Dawson Fairchild (a character who is often supposed to be modelled on Sherwood Anderson) which might be taken as a kind of definition of style. "I don't claim that words have life in themselves. But words brought into a happy conjunction produce something that lives, just as soil and climate and an acorn in proper conjunction will produce a tree. Words are like acorns, you know. Every one of 'em won't make a tree, but if you just have enough of 'em, you're bound to get a tree sooner or later." There can be no doubt that Faulkner found a sufficiency of words and that a good many of his acorns turned into noble and durable oaks. Fate would have to be implacable indeed to dull his memory.</page></plain_text>
