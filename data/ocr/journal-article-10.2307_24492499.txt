<plain_text><page sequence="1">Material Interests and Morality in the Trade of Thai Talismans* Shirley Yee National University of Singapore Introduction Most studies of religion in Singapore have focused on beliefs and rituals by religious specialists and lay people in the contexts of officially recognized religious categories; not much attention has been devoted to material objects in religious practices. In this essay, I will explore a particular development among some Chinese who consider themselves adherents of "Buddhism" in Singapore — the trade of talismans produced by Thai monks. My aim is to show how material interests are thoroughly enmeshed in the whole moral discourse about these religious objects and that the trade is a variant of the ongoing speculative economic activities taking place in a capitalist society. While orthodox scriptural tenets downplay monetary and material interests, it is ironic that talismans are produced by monks and subjected to crass exchange as commodities. Thai talismans have become increasingly popular among Singaporean Chinese, particularly through the setting up, in the 1980s, of "Buddhist enterprises" (fohang) which are retail outlets for these religious objects. The interest in Thai talismans is intrinsically related to the worship of Thai monks whose supernatural powers are believed to be animistically transferable to an objective medium, such as images and talismans. The circulation of mythological knowledge takes two forms: textual form, as advertisements, magazines and pamphlets; and oral form, as narratives generated by social actors in the talisman trade, especially entrepreneurs of Buddhist enterprises. The circulation of mythological knowledge sustains people's beliefs in, and curiosity about Thai monks and talismans. My ethnographic material is derived from fieldwork carried out in Buddhist enterprises in Singapore and from interviews with Thai monks, religious specialists and the laity in Singapore and in Thailand between April 1989 and May 1991. This essay is adapted from my unpublished M.Soc.Sci. thesis, "Thai Buddhist Cosmology and Its Influence in Singapore" submitted to the Department of Sociology, National University of Singapore, in 1992.1 am grateful to Dr Chang Chen Tung and Dr Vivienne Wee, both formerly from the Department of Sociology, for their supervision at various stages of fieldwork and thesis-writing and to Professor Geoffrey Benjamin for his encouragement. I also thank Professor Michael Hill and Dr Lian Kwen Fee of the Department of Sociology for their useful comments on the first draft of this essay.</page><page sequence="2">2 • Shirley Yee Thai Monks and Talismans In the social interaction between a monk and a lay person, the former acts as a spiritual superior to the latter. By offering donations and showing respect for the monk, the lay devotee believes that he gains merit for himself in this and subsequent lives (Ishii, 1984:14-18). In return, the monk may show benevolence by conducting rituals of blessing or gift-giving of a talisman to the merit-maker. Some of the monks whom I interviewed said that the talisman is given as a token of remembrance or a keepsake, and this has a scriptural basis. As Tambiah (1984:201) notes, in the Kalingabodhi Jataka (IV, 228), the Buddha spoke of three kinds of "reminders" of himself in his absence: saririka [relics of his body], paribhogika [relics by association] and uddesika [relics which are prescribed]. The relics by association, such as the bodhi tree and the cakra wheel, were most appropriate and all three "reminders" could be venerated only after his death. The canonical view was later re-interpreted by Buddhist commentators, such as Bohiransi in Thailand: images of the Buddha came to be viewed as having power in the ontological and not merely in the symbolic sense. My informants regarded talismans produced and chanted over1 by Thai monks as distinctly different from and more powerful than Chinese talismans. The source of power of Thai monks is believed to come from their meditative and ascetic practices. This power is believed to be animistically transferred through chanting by and physical contact with the monks. Thai talismans can either be made from materials which have been in contact with the monks (food leftovers or substances from their temples, such as incense ash), or they can be mass-produced in factories and then chanted over by monks in sacralization ceremonies. By contrast, Chinese talismans are ahistorical, non-aesthetic and non-related to monks. In a typical shop selling Chinese charms, the objects are not displayed as individual pieces but are jumbled up in trays. No labels are attached to individual pieces to indicate the name, history or producer of the talisman. The person manning the shop, who is simply the shopkeeper, may not even remember the prices and definitely not the name of any monk who sacralized them. There are no unique features that individuate the talismans; in fact, the anonymity of individual Chinese talismans is very much related to the anonymity of Mahayana monks. The latter are merely ritual enactors whose importance resides strictly in their role vis-à-vis the deities: they are simply "Buddhists" who have chosen the homeless life to practise chanting, meditation, vegetarianism and religious study (Welch, 1967). Supernatural powers are thought to inhere in boddhisattvas and not in the person of the monk. In a typical "Buddhist enterprise" strictly selling Thai talismans, on the other hand, the pieces are individuated by particular mythological histories and sacralized by specific Thai monks. The person selling the talismans is not merely a shopkeeper but one who is regarded as having expert ritual knowledge. He is likely to be able to narrate to customers the mythology of individual talismans — such as the name of the monk who produced and chanted over it, the name of the temple where it was sacralized, its unique functions and stories of people who have benefited from its efficacious powers. The prices of the Thai talismans, which are neatly displayed and labelled in Chinese, are directly related to the mythologization of the person of the monk who produced them. The greater the supernatural power thought to inhere in the monk, the greater will be the value accruing to the talisman. Hence the first</page><page sequence="3">Material Interests and Morality in the Trade of Thai Talismans • 3 question that any prospective buyer would ask is the details of the monk who produced and chanted over the talisman. The highest priced and most valuable talismans are the scarce objects produced and /or blessed by deceased charismatic monks followed by living charismatic monks. The cheaper talismans which flood the market are those blessed by ordinary monks, either dead or alive. Frazer's classification of imitative and contagious magic (1944:16) serves as useful ideal-typical constructs in the comparison of Chinese and Thai talismans. Imitative magic is based on the association of ideas by similarity, while contagious magic is based on the idea that things which have once been in contact with each other continue to act on each other at a distance, either temporally or spatially. Chinese talismans are imitative of the mythological gentlemen of the ancient bureaucracy who became deified. Thai talismans, on the other hand, are believed to be efficacious only after they have come into physical contact with the bodies of powerful, charismatic Thai monks. The disdain for counterfeits in the trade of Thai talismans is sufficient as an indicator that their efficacy is not based on imitative magic. The talisman trade is intrinsically related to the worship of charismatic Thai monk-producers: the degree of power and extent of monetary value attributed to the entities is directly proportional to the fame of the monk, since the talismans are construed as his objectification. Devotees will bow with their head on the ground at the feet of a charismatic monk, or touch them as if they were touching a sacred source. Anything that comes into contact with these charismatic monks (such as food leftovers or palm prints) becomes material for talismans. Thai popular magazines frequently contain accounts in which devotees describe their sense of great privilege in meeting an eminent monk face-to-face, and consider it as an indication of past merit. Based on my fieldwork, a typology of seven ideal-types of monks may be constructed (see Figure 1). There appear to be three components in the charismatization Figure 1: Ritual Ordering of Thai Monks Scale of Moral Goodness • Intellectual reformist monks • Politicized clerical monks • Ordinary monks Scale of Charisma Region of Charismatization • Forest meditation monks • Talisman-producing monks Expelled monks Magical arts monks</page><page sequence="4">4 • Shirley Yee of Thai monks: first, opposition to rational bureaucracy (hence, peripherality to the Sangha); second, mythologization of their voluntary suffering; and third, psychic power (manifested in miracles) which is construed as the product of that suffering. These conditions are fulfilled in forest meditation monks, talisman-producing monks and monks who perform magical arts (sayasaad). Forest meditation monks are similar to intellectual reformist monks in that they disapprove of the "superstitious" practices of the masses and instead emphasize strict adherence to the Buddha's teachings by ascetic behavior and meditation. However, most forest meditation monks tend to be less self-conscious than intellectual reformist monks about manifestations of "psychic power" and they practise ascetic journeys (thudong) in the wild more so than reformist monks. During meditation, which leads to calmness and trance states, these monks are said to be able to communicate with heavenly beings (devas). Far from living in a demythologized world, the world of the forest meditation monks is very much alive with experiences of mythological proportions. Although such monks do not generally produce or chant over talismans, a number of valuable talismans are believed to have been produced or sacralized by deceased monks in this category. Talisman-producing monks are consistently involved in the production of talismans and images for distribution to the laity, either as gifts or for sale. Mythological constructions of individual talisman-producing monks and their talismanic products constitute vital knowledge especially for those involved in the trade of talismans. Respected talisman-producing monks make only a limited number of products, for scarcity raises their value. These monks then imprint secret signs on the products to "prove" their authenticity. The monks are made eminent through myths about their discipline and suffering from which their power is thought to be derived. The myths are circulated in magazines and the tabloid press which advertise the monks' talismans and their marks of authenticity. There is a hierarchical ordering of talisman-producing monks, led by those who are mythologized as semi-divine beings and followed by lesser-known monks. Magical arts (sayasaad) monks are those who perform rites based on amoral power. These rites are viewed as a supernatural battles against spiritual forces. These monks may be regarded as morally ambiguous practitioners who are posited near to the axis of capricious power rather than moral goodness. Sayasaad rites range ambiguously from healing of illnesses, exorcism of spirits from persons, places and objects and spirit-mediumship to sacralization of objects belonging to the lower order of the moral hierarchy of talismans, such as those used in the charming of the opposite sex, drinking, fighting and gambling. For reformist-minded monks, sayasaad rites are not only "superstitious" but indeed the very antithesis of the rational Buddhist canon, sayasaad monks being part of the "polluted" and "degenerate" category of the monkhood along with talisman-producing monks. Charismatic monks whose products are sought after are usually old and they stand out above the massive number of ordinary monks, clerical monks and intellectual monks, although they tend to describe themselves modestly as "ordinary monks". Unlike politicized clerical monks who conform to the centrally-controlled Sangha, charismatic monks are thought to be indifferent to the demands imposed by "the world". Unlike intellectual reformist monks who are wary of attachment to psychic '* states and who hermeneutically reduce supernatural beings to empirical phenomena,</page><page sequence="5">Material Interests and Morality in the Trade of Thai Talismans • 5 charismatic monks accept that both psychic power and supernatural beings have a legitimate place in Buddhist belief and practice. Indeed, the charismatic impulse is fired by intimations of the supernatural: that is why intellectual monks, though high on the scale of moral goodness, are not charismatized. Typology of Thai Talismans There are three generic types of religious objects used in the Thai Buddhist context: (1) religious images, which are larger than talismans, are placed on the altar in a house or workplace and presented with offerings; (2) talismans, which are worn or carried about on the body. There are different rituals that need to be performed by the individual on different talismans in order to bring out the functional efficacies of the talismans; and (3) bottles of oil, which are carried or applied to the body. One type is said to contain "little ghosts" (kwai-tsai) which depend on the owner for food and are able to grow and to reciprocate by doing anything which the owner desires. A hierarchy of Thai talismans exists in that those entities which are construed as highest in moral goodness are worn around the neck while those in the lower rank are hung around the waist. This mirrors the high-low, purity-pollution distinction which, in Thai consciousness, is reflected in the idea that the head is the most sacred part while the feet are the most polluted part. The highest entities are symbolized by the Buddha while the lowest are symbolized by other anthropomorphic figures (see Figure 2). Images and talismans in the highest rank, such as Buddha images and Phra Somded2, are regarded as works of art with historical value. They are scrutinized with a magnifying glass in Buddhist enterprises in Thailand and in Singapore, while this never happens with talismans of the lower ranks as the latter are procured for utilitarian, not aesthetic, purposes. Annual competitions are held in Bangkok for the best-kept talismans of the high but never for the low levels of the hierarchy. Similarly, only talismans of the high rank are encased. Encasing reflects the care of the worshipper in sustaining the talismans' power and monetary worth, since talismans can be re sold at prices commensurate with their degree of preservation. Although innovative features may be improvised on the various types of talismans (such as Phra Somded with tigers' fur at the rear), the degree of creativity is bounded by the purity-pollution logic. For instance, figures of the Buddha, charismatic monks or the Brahma, which are regarded as sacred, are not immersed in bottles of oil which are deemed as polluting. There are plad'khig (phallic) talismans (ambiguous) with a monkey riding on it but never with a figure of a monk (high). Among talismans of the low rank, there are some which appear in an unambiguously erotic form such as aj'per (naked man) and others which appear in more ambiguous form, such as the Phra Ngan (distorted Buddha) which is used as a love charm and for drinkers (see photographs). According to my informants, scarce and old talismans chanted over by deceased charismatic Thai monks are "authentic" objects worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, which the owners would not sell nor give up for all the money in the world.</page><page sequence="6">6 • Shirley Yee Those who are wealthy can afford to pay for such rare talismans which are believed to be efficacious and valuable. Less wealthy customers can only afford relatively cheaper ones which may not be old and rare but which are nevertheless thought to be efficacious products of eminent Thai monks. The highest-valued are old talismans of the Phra Somded type. The specificity of individual pieces is evidenced in the spectacular gamut of particular names given in this genre alone. Phra Somded talismans may look alike but they are deemed to be qualitatively different due to their specific histories. Counterfeit talismans, which are a prevalent feature of the trade, may be passed off as authentic ones, thus enabling their producers to make huge profits. The interest in authentic Phra Somded talismans is accentuated by a market full of counterfeits made by less noble monks. The concern with authentic Phra Somded talismans explains why they are always closely scrutinized for marks of authenticity, called "imperfections" (tamni) (see Tambiah, 1984:219). All customers believe that "inauthentic" talismans (those which are not blessed) are powerless and worthless.

The reverse sides of the talismans have cabalistic signs and other Buddhistic symbols embossed on them. The talisman at the bottom left side shows a charismatic monk called Somded Phra Phutacaan To. According to informants, Phra Somded talismans made by this particular monk belong to the highest order in the hierarchy. He is said to have lived an ascetic life, performing meritorious acts and magical feats. It is said that he used his food leftovers and other substances from temples (where he briefly resided, as he was an itinerant monk, living in the wild for long periods of time) to fashion thousands of Phra Somded talismans in his lifetime. He blessed and distributed these talismans as he went out to beg for food. Phra Somded talismans are supposed to protect the owner from accidents, including making soldiers invulnerable to bullets, as well as to bring good luck. Plate 2: The photograph on the left shows two charismatic Thai monks surrounded by talismans produced by them. Such pictures are very common in Thailand and in Buddhist enterprises selling Thai talismans in Singapore.</page><page sequence="8">8 • Shirley Yee SRKSMBE loaaasoi i BQOHiBfiEfi i nsxcofi ipmi rrm Q[ :□□□□□□□□□ icocpomi nBS3Di! Essr* Plate 3: The photograph above shows individually encased Phra Somded talismans and medallions hung in a Buddhist enterprise in Singapore. In the foreground are images of kumaarithong (Golden Baby) which is the only deity occurring in all three generic types of Thai religious objects, namely as images, small talismans and as figures immersed in oil. There is an amazing variety of iconographie forms of this deity and there are specific monks who are specialists in the production and sacralization of kumaari thong. Next to the kumaari thong images are fortune bearing trees (maj'kaa'long). Plate 4: The talismans above show black figures of a naked man and woman. The figure of the naked woman (on the left and right) is called ii'per. Ii' is a derogatory word which means a female criminal, slave or prostitute (Haas, 1964:619). The figure of the naked man in the centre is called aj'per. A)' is also a derogatory reference to a male criminal or slave. In these talismans, the sexual organs are deliberately accentuated (see, for example, the fully erect penis in the male figure). They are used explicitly for sexual purposes (such as to heighten one's sexual appeal) and are sold in large numbers outside brothels in Singapore. The Thai talismans used explicitly for amoral sexual purposes (particularly in the sex trade) always appear in black.</page><page sequence="9">Material Interests and Morality in the Trade of Thai Talismans • 9 Plate 5: The top left talisman shows a distorted form of the Buddha called Phra Ngan which is sold in Buddhist enterprises and by peddlers outside brothels in Singapore. A type with protruding eyes is supposed to make the wearer very irritable (ngan) and some people call it the "dirty Buddha" (angzangfo). Phra Ngan must not be placed with Buddha images — the dirtier the places where he is placed, the stronger its believed power. It is said that Phra Ngan must be fed with liquor and any food that is green, because Phra Ngan's face is green. I have been told that there are Phra Ngan talismans worth hundreds of thousands of dollars as they can fulfil any wish of the owner, in particular, to charm women. This is done by inserting a woman's birth particulars into the underside of the talisman and through repeated chanting, using the woman's name, by a sorcerer. It is also worn around the waists of men who compete in drinking bouts. It is said that such a man would not get drunk no matter how much liquor he consumed, except that his face would turn green. While some informants regard the deity as belonging to the "crooked sect" (xiepai), others claim that it is the immorality of people that makes the deity bad. It does not appear immersed in bottles of oil, probably because of its iconographie association with the pure Buddha. The two talismans at the top centre and right which show a couple kissing in an embrace are called iirithong. It belongs to the broad category of talismans used to increase the personal charm of the user (khryng sanee) — particularly by those in the entertainment industry and sex trade who rely on attracting clients for a living, lin'thong is used to increase the user's charm in attracting members of the opposite sex. It is also used by ritual specialists to bring a man and woman together, lin'thong also appears in bottles of oil. The oil has to be applied to one's body to attract the sexual partner. The talismans in the centre and bottom are phalluses called plad'khig with magical signs and monkeys respectively. In some other phallic talismans, there is a woman lying on it. While people generally say that it is used by men to attract women, there are advertisements which deliberately attempt to legitimize its status as a talisman which increases one's personal charm rather than as just a vulgar sex-toy. Some informants said that prostitutes carry plad'khig to ward off sorcery attacks by men or pimps. A number of Thai talismans in the morally ambiguous category are thought to be used by prostitutes as their frequent intimate interactions with clients are believed to make them very vulnerable to such attacks, such as when their clients secretly retain certain parts of their body (such as hair or fluids).</page><page sequence="10">10 • Shirley Yee Plate 6: The talismans in the centre and on the right above show two talismans of kumaan'thong (Golden Baby). The one in the centre has peculiar iconographie features associated with a famous monk (Luang Phor Supoj') who specialized in the production of kumaan'thong. The black naked kumaan'thong on the right is said to be carried by prostitutes to prevent pregnancy, since kumaan'thong is believed to be a stillborn baby. The kumaan'thong in the bottle of oil on the left belongs to the lowest category of amoral talismans in the hierarchy and are considered by Chinese users in Singapore to be highly dangerous "little ghosts" (kwai-tsai). These little ghosts of kumaan'thong can be "reared" like a child — they must be fed and they are believed to be able to grow physically. It is said that they can do anything that their owners desire. Chinese Singaporean informants say that kumaan'thong is originally a good deity who can be made to practise immoral deeds because of people's wicked intentions. There is a wide area of moral ambiguity in this deity — he is thought to be potentially good (waiting to be reborn as a human being, or a good spirit which has been "baptised into Buddhism") or potentially bad if people use him in sorcery. Like the mythological construction of Phra'Ngan, the child deity is thought to be corrupted or moralized by people in the world. Plate 7: The two bottles on the extreme left and right are said to contain figures of two brothers rag' and yom'. According to informants, rag'yom is used to attract members of the opposite sex, especially by men. I have also been told that it is used by gamblers. The bottle of oil without any figure immersed in it is called "social affinity oil" (renyuan yu or namman meedtaa) which has to be applied to one's body (normally the forehead) to increase one's charm, making one popular with others. The bottle between the "social affinity oil" and rag'yom contains two symbolic mynahs (talking birds) called saalikaa. Applying the oil in this bottle is believed to make one a smooth talker, making one's speech, as it were, well lubricated.</page><page sequence="11">Material Interests and Morality in the Trade of Thai Talismans •11 some individual pieces of Thai talismans are mythologically constructed as "authentic" there are four factors that must be spelt out: (1) the mythologization of the monk-producer; (2) its history of production; (3) its hierarchical ranking and (4) its mode of production. Figure 3 shows the ritual ordering of Thai talismans according to their believed power and morality. Whereas entities which are personally made and blessed by charismatic monks are regarded as more powerful than those made in factories, greater power is attributed to those blessed by charismatic monks, although made in factories, than those personally made and blessed by ordinary monks. The reputed power and fame of the monk-producer is a more salient feature than the mode of production of the talisman.

This interest is generated chiefly through the circulation of myths in advertisements and business discourses. Since the objects are, on another level, exchanged as commodities, Buddhist enterprises are indeed business enterprises. Buddhist enterprises thus serve first, as significant centres where knowledge of Thai Buddhist cosmology is generated and secondly, as profit-making enterprises. Tambiah (1984:195) has reported a proliferation of such business enterprises in Thailand and my fieldwork in 18 Buddhist enterprises in Singapore also attested to the heightened interest in the trade in recent years. Buddhist enterprises can be ranked according to the degree to which the discourses about them belong exclusively to Thai religious culture (that is, to their degree of "Thai-ization"). The enterprise on the top of the list, and also the most popular at the time of my fieldwork, appeared to be one called Genuine Thai Buddha Gallery. The manager showed impressive knowledge of the talismanic trade which he communicated with professional confidence. Another enterprise was called Fo Guang Hang which published the most and the longest advertisements in the Chinese tabloid press during that time. In these two enterprises, which were located in central shopping districts, there were Chinese labels of the names of talismans, monks and temples in Thailand, transliterated from Thai terminology. There were certificates that were supposed to authenticate the products, as well as ample photographs and pictures of famous charismatic Thai monks and their talismans. Other enterprises exhibited less of the above features and some of them sold a mixture of Thai and Chinese religious objects. Only five enterprises were located in housing estates; the others were in Chinatown and along the Rochore-Serangoon-Joo Chiat stretch which has a high density of retail markets. The trade of Thai images and talismans in Singapore appears to be dominated by those enterprises which had published advertisements or magazines. According to informants, there is a difference between a talisman given as a gift from a monk and one that is sold in shops; they perceived the former as authentic whereas counterfeits could be sold in shops. Thus advertisements by Buddhist enterprises must necessarily construct myths about the authenticity and scarcity of the products, since people might otherwise prefer to obtain them from monks in temples. The managers of Buddhist enterprises in Singapore are either ex-monks who had received ritual knowledge from Thai monks or lay businessmen who were collectors of Thai talismans. Those who were ex-disciples of Thai monks also acted as ritual specialists and practised fortune-telling and counter-sorcery in their shops. Entrepreneurs who were never robed were essentially businessmen who had obtained talismans as gifts after making merit to monks in Thailand before subsequently selling them in Singapore. Some Thai entrepreneurs said that the Singaporean, entrepreneurs purchased talismans (as commodities) in bulk from Thai temples in Thailand as well as from the Thai entrepreneurs themselves. This, however, was not mentioned either by the Singaporean entrepreneurs or in any of the advertisements. The moral dimension of the talismanic trade (that talismans are gifts in exchange for piety and merit) was articulated whereas the material aspect (talismans bought as commodities to be re-sold) was kept out of the Singaporeans' discourses. There were at least 30 different advertisements about Thai talismans published in the Chinese tabloid press by Buddhist enterprises in Singapore between 1 July 1989 and 31 March 1990, featuring photographs of talismans, Thai monks and the managers of the enterprises. Two types of talismans were excluded from the advertisements:</page><page sequence="13">Material Interests and Morality in the Trade of Thai Talismans '13 amoral objects used explicitly for sexual purposes and old and rare Phra Somded which cost thousands of dollars. Old and rare pieces were not featured because the advertisements were targeted at the mass of potential customers who had limited means. There were two noteworthy points about the advertisements: firstly, although they were translated and transliterated from Thai sources, they were inadvertently sinicized in the process. Secondly, there were two levels on which these objects were presented: as authentic religious objects and as commodities. Both levels are related to the construction of scarcity as shown in an advertisement published by Genuine Thai Buddha Gallery in the Chinese press: Among Thai monks in Thailand, there are countless people who make images of kumaarithong. But everyone knows that one particular monk, luang'phor Phra'Long makes three types of kumaan'thong which are efficacious beyond comparison. His fame has spread throughout Southeast Asia for a long time. Luang'phor Phra'Long personally chanted for devotees for 7,749 days and specially produced and sacralized images of kumaan'thong'nawa'loha'. It is not only very convenient to wear; it can bring wealth, better renyuan (social affinity) and good business for you ... Is the maj'kaa'long' fortune-bringing tree that you are worshipping powerful? Are you worshipping it wrongly? We welcome you to our shop and let the Master advise you. If the maj'kaa'long' that you are worshipping is not powerful, we also welcome you to come and let the Master chant over it and sprinkle holy water to make it more potent. Maj'kaa'long is a divine tree made and chanted after many years, by a famous monk in Thailand — Master Taweiming. At the same time, the Master used wood from the trunk of the tree to produce images of the goddess Maj'kaa'long'. His products are powerful beyond comparison. All worshippers will have fortune and your lucky star will shine on you. To All: Great Bargain for Maj'kaa'long Original Price: $38 New Price for Each Pot: $9 Due to overwhelming response, maj'kaa'long have been snatched up by devotees. Our gallery has imported another batch of Maj'kaa'long for all to worship. Please take note. First come, first to get. Stocks are limited. Genuine Thai Buddha Gallery's manager, Peter, has studied about and has had a lot of experience with Thai images and talismans for the past 30 years. Everyone who is experienced in dealing with Thai talismans in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand knows Peter. In recent years, he has been invited to be a judge in talisman competitions. He won first prize in the "Bronze Section" in 1987. (Xinshenhuobao, December 1989) On the first level, the talismans of kumaarithong and the maj'kaa'long are constructed as scarce entities: there are countless who make them but few as powerful as those sacralized by the "famous" luang'phor' Phra' Long and Master Taweiming. The two monks, moreover, are said to be experts or specialists in the production and sacralization of their respective talismanic products. The manager is also regarded as an expert in the talismanic trade: there is a photograph of him receiving the first prize in a talisman competition in Thailand. On the second level, the objects must be constructed as having practical or use values for consumers. Hence they are "convenient" and are said to bring fortune and popularity to all those who have the products. The means of persuasion used include</page><page sequence="14">14 • Shirley Yee the asking of rhetorical questions (about the trees), the construction of "the Master" as the answer to those questions, graphical depiction of the slashed price and photographs. The discursive style of the advertisement is detached and business-like. Readers are persuaded to buy the objects or to go to the shop for an opportunity to meet the Thai monk; the underlying rationale is that the talismans and the opportunity to meet the monk are scarce. Indeed, the construction of authentic Thai images and talismans as scarce goods amidst a host of powerless counterfeits is central to the commercial discourse of entrepreneurs. It is a marketing technique, resulting in a vicious cycle: Construction of scarcity of authentic object Depletion of those Flood of customers objects after advertising who rush to buy the objects Commodity Fetishism and the Commodification of Fetishes When informants were asked why authentic talismans were so sought after, they articulated those features of the talismanic economy which negated the profanity of the capitalist system: those few individuated pieces were said to be personally made and chanted over by deceased charismatic monks and given as gifts to devotees. The few authentic objects, encapsulating the merit of the monk, are thus positioned above the host of counterfeits. They are treated not only as having scarcity value but also as objects with individuated, unique histories of their own. Thai talismans can therefore be said to be authenticated by ideal features of their production and distribution, which represent the negation of profane capitalism. While the negation of capitalism creates the interest in talismans, this negation of capitalism is itself negated as capitalist elements penetrate the talismanic economy, resulting in the commercialization of supernatural power (see Figure 4). Thus talismans are not just proto-typical "pure" gifts but are transformed into commodities by entrepreneurs, employed for the accumulation of profits. In the capitalist labour process, the worker's labour power is sold to the capitalist as a commodity (Marx, 1965:165); the worker has no freedom of control over his own labour power since the product is appropriated by the capitalist. When products are brought in a mutual relation of exchange values, labour takes on the common feature of being universal, abstract, ahistorical and homogeneous. Money is the universal means of exchange which conceals the social character of labour and mystifies the social relations between workers such that social relations take on the form of the relation of things. Thus the commodity is changed into "something transcendent" (Marx, 1965:72). Marx saw fetishes as the "productions of the human brain (which) appear as independent beings endowed with life" (Marx, 1965:72) and</page><page sequence="15">Material Interests and Morality in the Trade of Thai Talismans • 15 Figure 4: Dialectic of the Talismanic Economy in Capitalist Society Capitalist Mode of Negation of Capitalism in Production and Distribution Production of Talismans 1.

The worker is estranged from his object of labour which confronts him as something alien (Marx, 1964:108). There is no real freedom in the act of production because his labour power, which is intrinsic to his being, belongs to the capitalist. Since exchange values are but the material embodiment of congealed labour time, nothing in the product shows the uniqueness of the individual producer. Each product has the stamp of monotonous sameness in the mass of standardized goods in which prices are differentiated by brands. Branded goods (such as designer or handmade products) do appear to be the negation of the prosaic capitalist economy but even then they are not in any real sense individuated; they are scarce vis-à-vis mass-produced goods but similar to goods belonging to the same brand. By contrast, the ideal-typical production of authentic talismans appears as the negation of capitalism. The objects are treated as objects of art akin to aesthetic and antique productions which fetch a high price precisely because they are at the fringe of the prosaic capitalist economy. The charismatic monk has freedom of control in the production process. He uses unusual materials and relics to fashion different talismans in different colours and textures. The materials and method of production are infused with symbolic meanings. Through artistry and creativity, he produces not one type but a gamut of talismans, each of which has a history. These products are literally an extension of his being, an objectification of himself as he breathes over them. Antiques are probably the closest to authentic Thai talismans in that they are individuated. The difference is that talismans are highly valued because of their sacralization by the monk. Thus they represent the objectification of supernatural power whereas no such transcendental worth is attributed to ordinary antiques. The mythical negation of capitalism is looped back into the wider capitalist context: the distinctive talismanic trade began in Thailand and is spreading to other economic orbits such as Singapore. Capitalism has its fetishes — commodities — which have an almost magical hold over people. In this cosmology, suffused with the spirit of modern consumerism (Campbell, 1987), everything is potentially commodified to be sold and re-sold in an endless circulation of goods in the vast marketplace. This ironically encompasses the commodification of Buddhist fetishes which began as gifts</page><page sequence="16">16 • Shirley Yee to merit-makers. As for the people who buy the talismans ("consumers"), the motivation derives from the idealized benefit of aquiring more worldly wealth and power through the believed power of the monk. For Marx, the source of capitalist contradiction lies in the fact that the work of individuals will have no account unless it is "metamorphosed" as it enters the sphere of exchange. This takes two forms: as the simple circulation of commodities (C) mediated by money (M) [C-M-C] and as the circulation of capital [M-C-M'] (Marx, 1965). This simple circulation of commodities [C-M-C'] involves the exchange of two commodities with equivalent use-values, in which any difference is "purely accidental". By contrast, the circulation of capital [M-C-M'] "commences with money and ends with money; (i)ts leading motive, the goal that attracts it, is therefore, more exchange value" (Marx, 1965:149). The capitalist buys commodities cheaply to re-sell them more dearly, thereby converting the original sum of money into capital. As discussed, entrepreneurs donate money as gifts to temples in exchange for talismans which they sell more dearly, thus appropriating profits. Figure 5 shows the conversion of money donated to temples into capital: Figure 5: Conversion of Donations into Capital M ► C ► M' Money donated by Talismans given Re-selling of talismans devotees to temple as gifts by monks by devotees Exchange becomes an end-in-itself and theoretically, there can be no limit to this process. The greater the number of hands through which commodities are exchanged, the higher the selling price (Marx, 1965:113). Thus, factory-made talismans are circulated, through monks, to entrepreneurs from other countries, raising the selling price at every stage of circulation: Figure 6: Conversion of Talismans and Money into Capital Production Chanting Selling and re-selling at factory at temple by peddlers/entrepreneurs M ► C ► M1 ► C1 ► M2 ► C2 ^ M3 ► C3 Sale to Sale to Thai Sale to Singaporean temple sellers entrepreneurs entrepreneurs There are two economic motivations underlying the resale of Thai talismans by entrepreneurs in Singapore. First of all, Singapore is not as saturated with marketing outlets of Thai religious objects as is Thailand. This makes retail easier, especially if Singaporean customers are persuaded by the mythopoeia of talismans. Secondly, Singaporean entrepreneurs capitalize on the difference in currency exchange rates and in the prices of goods in both countries from which they stand to gain economically. To cite two hypothetical cases, a cheap talisman sold by peddlers in Thailand costs 10 baht. Suppose an entrepreneur buys and re-sells it in Singapore for $10, he earns about eighteen times the original price (exchange rate S$l:18 baht). Suppose he buys it for 200 baht from a Buddhist enterprise in Thailand and re-sells it at $69 in</page><page sequence="17">Material Interests and Morality in the Trade of Thai Talismans • 17 Singapore, he will earn about six times the original price. The re-selling of Thai talismans in Singapore is just another point on the whole spectrum of speculative economic activities fetishly pursued here: from houses to club memberships. Piety or Profit, Merit or Money: Legitimization by Discourse According to the Buddha's teaching, there is a dual ethical standard of economic management for laity and monks. There exists a Buddhist work ethic for the laity (Gombrich, 1988:78) which acknowledges the importance of material production to meet physical requirements. Monks, however, are forbidden by the Vinaya to engage in any form of "trafficking with money", such as in the production of commodities and trading (Timasa Nissaggiya Pacittiya, IV, 18-20). Intellectual reformist monks have spoken scathingly about the commodification of talismans produced by monks, which they see as a gross infringement of Vinayic rules. Given the ambivalent nature of the trade of talismans produced by monks from the doctrinal view, one should expect strategic forms of legitimization by actors in the trade. Indeed, the business of producing and selling Thai talismans is couched in moral and religious terms. What the researcher sees as brute economistic undertakings is legitimized discursively as acts of Buddhist merit and piety. Foremost, the enterprise is called a "Buddhist" one. The most commonly articulated lègitimizing phrases are given in the table below: Meaning that is Legitimized Legitimizing Terminology Meaning of Legitimizing Terminology Buy an image or talisman gong qing (Chinese); chaw'phra' (Thai) offer borrow Sell image or talisman rang shan xin di zi qiu fu (Chinese) haj'chaw' (Thai) let meritorious brothers beg for wealth lend Selling price of image or talisman you jing (Chinese) rakaa buchaa (Thai) donation offering Possess image or talisman gong feng (Chinese) buchaa (Thai) worship Reasons for money going to temple jian miao, jian xuexiao, jian yi yuan (Chinese) sang wad, sang rongrian, sang rong payabaan (Thai) building temples, schools and hospitals Commodity Fo pin (Chinese) Phra' (Thai) Buddhist good sacred entity Buyer gong feng zhe (Chinese) worshipper Advertise jie hsao (Chinese) introduce</page><page sequence="18">18 • Shirley Yee The legitimization of the trade is reflected in one particular monk's discourse. Residing at a temple in Bangkok, he had once been invited to chant over talismans in well-known Buddhist enterprises in Singapore. He was a talisman-producing monk who had been featured in Thai magazines. He said that the talismans sold in that particular temple (which included morally ambiguous ones in the lower rank of the hierarchy in Figure 2) were obtained as gifts from other temples which received his temple's donations. He said that some recipient temples "deceived" his temple by reciprocating with worthless, counterfeit objects which were passed off as authentic. He explained that the talismans were sold at a higher price at his temple, so that the money could be used to "build temples". M ► C ► M' Donation from donor to Talismans given as gift Re-selling of talismans recipient temple by recipient temple by donor temple The monthly revenue through such sales was about 5,000 to 6,000 Baht, which was, he emphasized, used to "build temples". He said that some Singaporeans who came to donate money at his temple were given "free" talismans as souvenirs. He was unhappy that these Singaporeans then re-sold the gifts at $39 per piece in their Buddhist enterprises in Singapore. He insisted that the Singaporean entrepreneurs were "self centred", thinking of profits only for themselves: "They're selfish. They didn't contribute to building temples at all. Their intentions were no good in the first place. I was invited by one of them to chant over talismans in his shop. He paid for my airfare but not for my food and lodging. In the end, I had to spend money for my own requirements and did not manage to contribute anything for the building of temples at all. The manager was angry with me because, he said, monks are not supposed to talk about money. He's very calculative. Actually, they cheated our temple for their profits. They also cheat other people with advertisements about their talismans." (translated from Thai) He was quick to stress that since he himself was not the abbot, he did not receive much money for himself. To prove his point, he said that he had been ill and that he thanked the devas that the abbot had given him some money for his medical fees. Furthermore, his temple was unlike other wealthy temples which made millions of baht annually. He concluded that the efficacy of talismans depended on the intentions of producers; in the reformist vein, they served only as "reminders of the Buddha" and ought not to be commodities sold in the market. The significant point about his discourse lay in his defence that neither he nor his temple were themselves deceptive, but that he had been the victim of deception. In my view, this was probably because he was aware of the ambivalence of the trade and that he was talking to a researcher. His discourse was constructed on the grounds that his temple had "pious" intentions in selling talismans — to build temples — whereas the Singaporean entrepreneurs had "self-centred" intentions of profit-making. Legitimations can, and do, conceal contradictions. That some of the talismans sold in his temple belonged to the lower rank contradicted his statement that talismans were to serve as reminders of the Buddha. These lower rank talismans were explicitly published in the temple's advertising brochure: iirithong in bottles of oil were sold for</page><page sequence="19">Material Interests and Morality in the Trade of Thai Talismans • 19 3,900 baht each and were claimed to be able to increase personal charm (sanee) for singers and filmstars. Conclusion Both commodities in capitalist society and Thai talismans find their point of convergence in the alienation of subjectivity, namely the labour power of workers and the supernatural power of Thai monks. The negation of profane economy which is entrenched in the trade of Thai talismans is possible only because the power of monks is thought to be alienable and objectified before being hurled into the capitalist market. On the other hand, the inversion of subject and object, which Feuerbach saw as the source of religion, is a particular kind of alienation — self-estrangement (entfremdung) — in which the subject becomes controlled by the objects of his own creation. If man in capitalist society has lost real freedom and spun a web which enslaves his subjectivity to material forces of production, Thai monks have chanted over the very objects that will lure people into the labyrinth of worldly desires, from which the Buddha had cautioned them to flee. For this reason, it is difficult to concur with Kirsch's (1975,1982) thesis that the world-rejecting orientation of the Buddha's teachings dampens Thai men's entrepreneurial spirit, so that "it was non-Thai, particularly Chinese", who tended to fill entrepreneurial roles. To suppose that economic action is determined by ethno religious ideology is to stand vulgar historical materialism on its head. One striking feature about Bangkok is the sheer range of goods sold and re-sold by the Thais in the laissez faire market. The concept of kamma, which is the basis of Thai popular Buddhist belief, can be interpreted as legitimizing one's status quo and encouraging the rational use of available opportunities for positive economic actions (Keyes, 1989b). This-worldly success is interpreted as a manifestation of one's kamma which can never be fully known. Thus the rich are supposed to practise more merit than the poor; otherwise, their merit would be in danger of running out (Chaiwat, 1987:34). In my view, it is plausible that the Thais' keen opportunism in the pursuit of wealth to realize their kamma is related to a popular Buddhist work ethic: material gain is encouraged so that money can be used for merit-making. However, as the Weberian thesis has demonstrated, what might have begun as a means to religiously-defined ends can become an end-in-itself such that capital accumulation replaces the "Middle Way" as the rationale for economic action. I do not mean that Buddhist ideas are the causal imperative of the thoroughly capitalistic nature of Thai society; I am merely debunking the notion that the former is necessarily an obstacle to the latter. The economistic mentality of the marketplace creeps back into the monastery, although thinly disguised as the ghost of piety, in the form of legitimization by discourse. Just as the trade of talismans is inextricably tied to the worship of charismatic Thai monks, so are their prevailing ironies. The power of Thai monks, which is believed to be acquired by their material deprivation, suffering and distance from the social structure, is looped back to the profane order in the form of their talismanic products which serve worldly functions. Thus, the merits of the monk cancel the</page><page sequence="20">20 • Shirley Yee demerits of the masses; his hunger and thirst fills their stomachs; his deprivation fills their treasuries; his celibacy and asociality, from which a semblance of authentic existence is wrought, transfers personal charm or "social affinity" (renyuan/ meedtaa'mahaaniyom) — a pseudo individuality — to the masses; his exposure to dangers of the wild protects them against the terror of death, keeping their lives civilized and tranquil. The charismatic monk, in seeming to negate the inauthenticity of existence in the profane social order, thus negates the negation by becoming a mythic figure for those from whom he withdraws. In so far as the power of Thai monks is believed to be cultivated through detachment from profane existence, the dialectical movement of that power via talismans, in the service of amoral pursùits, must surely appear as a substantive contradiction. However, if detachment from worldly existence is the sine qua non for power which is looped back into profane society for monetary gain, chiefly by entrepreneurs, then the trade in these fetishes becomes less contradictory. Indeed this idea is irresistible when we consider that entrepreneurs would rather exchange the objects they herald as having magical propensities to create wealth, for money, than to have them as use-values. Notes Talismans must be chanted over, or blessed, by monks to infuse them with supernatural power. It is not only the words of the chant but also the ritual transfer of the power of the person chanting (a monk) to talismans, through the medium of chants, which is significant. The sacralization of talismans is integral to belief in the contagious magic of Thai talismans, which is to be distinguished from the imitative magic of Chinese talismans. The Phra SomdecL is the most common type of Thai talismans kept as collectors' items. They depict the unambiguously "pure" image of the Buddha or a famous monk in meditation.
