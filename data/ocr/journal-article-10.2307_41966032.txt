<plain_text><page sequence="1">Polaček, Zdenek, et ak Concise Sociopolitical Dictionary. Fnplkh-Amhari^ Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1990, Pp x+51L The compilers of the Dictionary have come up with a work which is both timely and in great demand. The sphere of sociopolitical terminology was so far untouched, and thus awaiting treatment. With the development of science, technology and the humanities, the vocabulary of a language confronted with such development also grows at a fast pace. This is clearly to be observed in the case of the Amharic language since the beginning of the 20*k century. However, translation and coinage of new terms were not treated in a centralized manner. So one tends to find two or more words for a single foreign term. A book of this type, is therefore, an indispensable tool that would contribute to the standardization and codification of technical terms. As the authors put it, the dictionary treats terms dealing with politics, international relations, law, philosophy, political economy, and the like. So far, terms dealing with these fields of study have not been treated with concerted effort. The dictionary is well-planned and is organized in such a way that it could give the user a handy reference. An English entry is put in various phrases in order to show its various functions. The same is done in the Amharic part where an Amharic main entry is also used in various contexts. The following could be cited as good illustrations: Consumption annual consumption consumption of labour power PA¿- cut down one's consumption P **A individual consumption f 1A per capita (per head) food- stuff consumption fV&lt;PA ioh^ trm personal private consumption flà A&lt;1 productive consumption social consumption VUÍÍà-t total (overall) consumption unproductive consumption The compilers of the dictionary have followed the system of the Amharic alphabet that was recommended by the Academy of Ethiopian Languages which, I believe, is a simpler way to be also followed in our writing system. The confusion that JES vol xxvn no.l June 1994 203</page><page sequence="2">arises in having two or three symbols for one sound system would be eliminated by adhering to such a system. There are, however three points which I consider to have been overlooked by the compilers. The compilers claim to have collected sociopolitical terms that were translated or coined during the sixteen years of the socialist regime. However, we find that many terms that are included in the dictionary have been in existence even before that period. Some of them are not nuances and are terms that have been widely used before the mentioned time. Examples of these are: for acceptance accord (p 6) •■hrtA for accuse (p 9) hm 7h¿ for adviser (p 17) mfl^ for advocate for affairs (p 18) for alternative (p 26) «»AMi for angel (p 32) íMJk A4IX for cannibal (p 85). The word «»AAb (angel) and its derivatives ^AMi ft and ^AAh are terms widely used in the Amharic language. Some of the terms that are included in the dictionary have not yet found, to my knowledge, any root in the Amharic language. They could be coinages suggested by certain individuals. Such terms, I believe, should not have been included in the dictionary. Examples of these are: JPU-ç for abstract (p.4) for abstraction (p.5) JfcTMiArAOJtf for anthropomorphic Aï A -OX for anthropology (p.35) fflňA for assimilation (p.52) A •? Mi Art for centralization p.39) Terms like "anthropology" and "archeology" are being used as loan words. Therefore, I feel that their inclusion here with their possible Amharic equivalents is superfluous. The material from pages 497-508, i.e., "The Structure and Use of the Dictionary", should have appeared at the begining since this is an accepted norm in lexicography. However, what has been said above should in no way be misconstrued as an attempt to undermine the usefulness of the dictionary at such a time when many articles, books and the like dealing with sociopolitical subjects are increasingly being written in Amharic.
