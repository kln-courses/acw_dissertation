ABSTRACT Limited data exist which quantify the kinematic response of the human head and cervical spine in low- speed rear-end automobile collisions. The objectives of this study were to quantify human head/neck kinematics and how they vary with vehicle speed change and gender during low-speed rear-end collisions. Forty-two human subjects (21 male, 21 female) were exposed to two rear-end vehicle-to-vehicle impacts (speed changes of 4 km/h and 8 km/h). Accelerations and displacements of the head and torso were measured using 6 degree-of- freedom accelerometry and sagittal high speed video respectively. Velocity was calculated by integrating the accelerometer data. Kinematic data of the head and C7-T1 joint axis in the global reference frame, and head kinematic data relative to the C7-T1 joint axis are presented. A statistical comparison between peak amplitude and time-to-peak amplitude for thirty-one common peaks in the kinematic response was performed. Peak amplitudes and time-to-peak amplitude varied significantly with collision severity for most response peaks, and varied significantly with gender for about one Quarter of the response peaks. INTRODUCTION Whiplash-Associated Disorders (WAD) comprised about 61 percent ($590 million) of all injury claims paid by the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia in 1995 [1,2]. In the United States, neck strains and sprains (assumed to be WAD) are the most serious injuries reported by 40 percent of claimants [3]. Despite the magnitude of this phenomenon, the injury mechanisms causing WAD remain unclear. The incomplete understanding of the injury mechanisms is partially the roei ilf nf limiłArl AAAimonf l/inomotir* rłoło r' f thû hûorl i wui i w i in incavi wwwu^/ui ii r'n iwi i luiiw uuiu vi u le i i^au, neck, and torso during low-speed rear-end collisions. Head and torso kinematic data exist for human subjects exposed to frontal collisions [4], and has been used to construct and validate mathematical models [5], For rear- end collisions, a common source of WAD [6], the data are less complete. Previous experiments examining the head, neck, and torso kinematics in low-speed rear-end collisions have used cadavers, anthropomorphic test devices (ATD's), and human subjects. Cadavers and current ATD's lack biofidelity in low-speed collisions [7,8], The complex intersegmental dynamics produced by a low- speed rear-end collision and the potential role of muscle force in whiplash kinematics currently make the use of human subjects the best method of evaluating occupant kinematics at lower collision severities. Severy et al, exposed a male volunteer to two rear-end impacts in 1950's vintage vehicles not equipped with head restraints [9]. Horizontal head and shoulder accelerations, and head extension determined from film analysis were reported for both collisions and showed the differential kinematic response of the head and shoulders to a rear-end collision. Mertz and Patrick also exposed a single male volunteer to multiple rear-end impacts with the head both supported and unsupported by a head restraint [7], The subject in these tests was seated in a rigid seat mounted to a laboratory test sled. Bi-axial head accelerations in the superior-inferior and anterior-posterior directions were recorded and resolved to the estimated center of mass of the head. This measurement technique allowed angular acceleration of the head about the medial-lateral axis to be quantified. These authors recognized that head kinematics relative to the torso were important and later proposed response envelopes for the head and neck based on torque at the occipital condyles as a function of head angle relative to u ic lui ou L tuj. In two separate and more recent studies, McConnell et al, exposed eight male subjects to multiple 3877</page><page sequence="2">impacts in 1980's vintage vehicles [11,12]. Based on their data, the authors developed a semi-quantitative description of the occupant kinematic response to a rear- end impact. Linear acceleration at a number of points on the head and angular acceleration and velocity about the medial-lateral axis of the head were reported. Transient symptoms of WAD were produced despite head extension remaining within the range of voluntary motion. Szabo et al, also in two separate studies, exposed seven male and three female subjects to rear-end impacts using 1970's and 1980's vehicles [13,14]. Resultant accelerations at the head's estimated center of mass were reported for both series of tests and the acceleration at the base of the cervical spine was reported for the first series of five subjects. Szabo et al, found that the peak head acceleration observed in their data was a result of head contact with the head restraint and was not necessarily an indicator of neck injury potential. Matsushita et al, subjected 22 males and 4 females to sled tests simulating rear-end collisions [15]. Head acceleration in the posterior-anterior direction of the head and bi-axial chest accelerations were reported for numerous pre-impact postures. These authors also used cineradiography to quantify segmental motion of the cervical vertebrae and found that initial posture influenced the kinematic response. Epidemiological studies have found that women suffer whiplash more frequently than men [16-21], Most proposed explanations for gender differences are based on observations that females have a greater head mass for their neck area [22] or neck strength [23] than do males. Although WAD have been reported after various impact directions and severities, they occur most commonly after rear-end collisions [6,21,24], and overall injury risk in rear-end collisions generally increases with collision speed change [17], Although these experimental studies have quantified some of the kinematic response, a detailed volunteer study with adequate sample size and instrumentation to compare and quantify the absolute and relative motion of the head and torso has yet to be performed. This paper presents detailed kinematic response data for 42 human subjects exposed to low- speed rear-end collisions at two severities, and specifically examines the effect of gender and collision severity on the peak kinematic response of the head, neck, and torso. MATERIALS AND METHODS SUBJECTS - Human subject protection policies and procedures were reviewed and approved by the Western Institutional Review Board of Olympia, Washington, USA. A more detailed description of the human subject handling procedures has been published elsewhere [25], Subjects between 20 and 40 years old were recruited by newspaper and job-line advertisements.

Subjects with a history of specific medical conditions or a prior or active injury claim were excluded. Potential subjects were then invited to the lab to undergo an initial screening process. Each subject was seated in an exemplar test seat to ensure that their head and not their neck contacted the head restraint. This criterion eliminated subjects with an erect seated height of 96 cm or greater (the median seated height for a 90th percentile male [27]), and excluded subjects with above-average seated heights who would otherwise have qualified based on standing height. After obtaining informed consent, subjects underwent a cervical magnetic resonance scan. Subjects with a disc bulge greater than 2 mm or degenerative findings deemed moderate or greater by a radiologist were excluded from the study. Forty-two subjects (21 males and 21 females) successfully completed the interview, screening, and informed consent and participated in the test procedure. Table 1 contains subject age and selected anthropometry data. INSTRUMENTATION - Head acceleration was measured using a nine accelerometer array (Kistler 8302B20S1; ±20g, Amherst, NY) arranged in a 3-2-2-2 configuration [28], A uni-axial angular rate sensor (ATA Sensors ARS-04E; ±100 rad/s, Albuquerque, NM) was attached to the accelerometer unit and oriented along the medial-lateral axis. This redundant sensor was used as a check on the primary head acceleration sensors. The accelerometer arrangement was secured to the subject's head with two straps as shown in Figure 1. The mass of the complete head instrumentation package was 198 grams, including straps and 40 cm of cable. Torso acceleration was measured using a tri-axial accelerometer (Summit 341 03A; ±7.5g, Akron, OH) and an angular rate sensor (ATA-Sensors DynaCube; ±100 rad/s). Both torso transducers were fastened to an aluminum plate, which was applied in the mid-sagittal plane to the chest immediately below the manubrium with adhesive. Straps over the shoulders and under the arms also secured the plate. The mass of the torso instrumentation package was 255 grams. The location and orientation of the head and torso instrumentation was measured relative to anatomical landmarks using a three-dimensional digitizer (FaroArm B08-02, Lake Mary, FL) with single-point aoouracv of +0 30 mm Í291.

Head Instrumentation Fiaure 2 Subiect seated in the vehicle FaroArm was certified according to the manufacturer's instruction before every test. Vehicle Instrumentation - Vehicle speeds were measured with a 5th wheel (MEA 5th Wheel, Richmond, BC) attached to each vehicle. Uni-axial load cells (Sensotec Model 41; range ±45 000 N, Columbus, OH) inserted at both rear bumper mounts of the Honda recorded the longitudinal component of the impact force (lateral and vertical components were assumed to be negligible). Bumper contact onset and duration were detected with two ribbon switches (Nortel TapeSwitch 121 BP; 2 N activation force, Scarborough, ON) connected in parallel and applied to the rear bumper of the target vehicle. Head restraint contact was detected by three force sensitive resistors (Interlink Electronics Inc.; 0.2 N activation, Camarillo, CA) connected in parallel and applied to the front of the head restraint. High-Speed Videoqraphy - Digital video of sagittal plane motion relative to earth was captured using an OmniSpeed HS motion capture system (Speed Vision Technologies, Solana Beach, CA) and high-speed camera (JCLabs 250; 512 x 216 lines resolution, Mountain View, CA). Video data were recorded at 250 frames per second (fps) using a shutter speed of 1/1000 s. Reflective targets were applied to the subject, seat, and vehicle (see Figure 2). Vehicle and seat targets were 25 mm in diameter and subject targets were 20 mm in diameter. Head targets were applied over the glabella, left temporomandibular joint, left lateral aspect of the cranium, and to the left side of the head accelerometer assembly; torso targets were applied in the mid-sagittal plane to the chest accelerometry and over the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebrae (C7); seat targets were applied to the upper seat back and head restraint; and vehicle targets were applied to the interior surfaces of the right front door and upper door frame (roof rail). Digital video data were digitized using OmniSpeed AutoTracker software with a combined experimental setup and video system accuracy of ± 2 mm at the vertical plane containing the seat centerline. Additionally, stationary video cameras (30 fps) were used to record front, overhead, and overall views of each test and an onboard video camera mounted to the driver's A-pillar captured an oblique view. TEST PROCEDURE - With their head stabilized in an optometrist's forehead rest, anatomical landmarks (glabella, upper incisors, vertex, opisthocranion, occiput, external acoustic meati, and bilateral lower rims of the orbits) were measured in three-dimensions with the FaroArm for each subject. Head and torso accelerometry and video targets were applied and their locations measured relative to the previously-measured landmarks. These data were subsequently referenced to the Frankfort plane, defined by the digitized locations of the lower orbit rims and the external acoustic meati. The torso instrumentation and head video targets were also digitized relative to selected vehicle and seat locations with the subject seated in the vehicle. The torso accelerometry was referenced to the mid-sagittal plane, manubrium and C7 spinous process. The right acromioclavicular joint, greater trochanter, and lateral femoral epicondyle were also digitized to record the subject's seated posture. The subjects were seated and restrained by a lap and shoulder seat belt in the front passenger seat of the test vehicle. Subjects were instructed to sit normally in the seat, face forward with their head level, place their hands on their lap, and to relax prior to impact. Because of the potential effect of pre-impact neck muscle contraction on kinematics, special attention was devoted to depriving the subjects of visual and aural nifis of thfi imnanriinn imnant and to ansurinn suhionts 3879</page><page sequence="4">were relaxed before the impact. A black felt curtain separated the target vehicle from the bullet vehicle and instrumentation equipment to eliminate visual cues. Foam ear plugs and music were used to defeat aural cues. No test personnel were visible to the subject in the minutes preceding the impact. The relaxed state of the occupant was confirmed visually with a live video feed from the A-pillar camera and by monitoring EMG signals from the sternocleidomastoid and cervical para-spinal muscles bilaterally for at least one-minute prior to impact. An aligned collision between a rolling bullet vehicle and a stationary target vehicle was used for this study. Both vehicles were in neutral and their engines were not running. The bullet vehicle accelerated down a ramp and its front bumper squarely struck the rear bumper of the unbraked target vehicle. After impact, the target vehicle rolled into gravel located 3 meters ahead of the vehicle and was decelerated to rest at about 0.12 g. Subjects were exposed to two impacts, one which produced a 4 km/h speed change on the target vehicle and another which produced an 8 km/h speed change. The order of impact-severity presentation was randomized. In all cases, the two impacts were separated by at least seven symptom-free days. VEHICLE SPECIFICATIONS - The bullet vehicle was a 1981 Volvo 240DL station wagon (mass 1618 kg) and the target vehicle was a 1 990 Honda Accord LX 4- door sedan (mass 1414 kg). The bullet vehicle was unaltered. The target vehicle's windshield, left doors, left B-pillar, driver's seat, and rear bench seat were removed. A hole was cut in the roof over the test subject to allow overhead filming. A custom B-pillar installed midway between the actual B-and C-pillar locations compensated for the reduced stiffness resulting from removal of the actual B-pillar. Mass was added to the vehicle to offset the removed parts. No damage (other than minor plastic straining of the Honda's rear bumper cover) was sustained by either vehicle over the 100-plus pre-study and study impacts. Aside from minor modifications to accommodate seat instrumentation, the Honda's seat remained in its stock condition. The fore/aft seat adjustment was locked in the full rear position and the seat back angle was maintained at about 27 degrees from the vertical. The head restraint was adjusted and locked to the full-up position for all subjects. Detailed information regarding seat back modifications made to accommodate the head restraint instrumentation has been presented elsewhere [30]. DATA ACQUISITION - Accelerometer, angular rate sensor, load cell and contact switch data were acquired at 10 kHz and each data channel conformed to SAE J211, Channel Class 1000 [31]. Signal conditioners onboard the vehicle were tethered to four 16-channel, 12-bit, simultaneous-sample-and-hold Win30 DAQ cards (United Electronics Incorporated, Watertown, MA). Low- pass line-noise filters were inserted immediately before the DAQ boards. All four DAQ boards were installed in the same computer and driven by a single external clock. Two seconds of data were acquired for each test, with a minimum of 0.4 s of pre-impact data. Fifth wheel data were acquired at 128 Hz and triggered by the bumper contact switch. Fifth wheel data were recorded simultaneously for both vehicles for 1 s before and 4 s after impact. A synchronization signal from the high- speed video camera was recorded by the DAQ system and LED's indicating bumper and head restraint contact were placed in each camera's field of view. REFERENCE FRAMES - Kinematic parameters obtained from the occupant-mounted transducers were initially resolved to local head and torso reference frames. For analysis and presentation, these data were resolved to the global reference frame at the appropriate origin. The head and neck origins, and the direction of the global axes, were defined as follows (Figure 3): The origin of the head was located at the estimated location of the head's center of mass, assumed to lie in the mid-sagittal plane. Its superior- inferior and anterior-posterior position was estimated for each subject based on regression equations published by Clauser et al [32], The origin of the neck was located in the mid-sagittal plane at the C7-T1 joint axis (center of rotation of the base of the neck), estimated to be at the midpoint between the C7 spinous process and the manubrium [33], ^ Figure 3. Reference frames for the head and C7-T1 joint axis. The broad arrows show the direction of positive rotation about each axis, (adapted from reference 34). The z-axis of the global reference frame was defined parallel to the direction of the earth's gravity and positive down. The x-axis was defined such that the xz- plane was parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and was defined positive toward the front of the vehicle. The y-axis was positive to the right. The global origin was arbitrary, but for reporting purposes, it was assumed to be at the pre-impact origin of either the head or C7-T1 3880</page><page sequence="5">joint axis, whichever was appropriate. Flexion and extension of the head/neck and torso in the sagittal plane occurred about the y-axis, with extension defined positive and flexion negative. DATA PROCESSING - The kinematic parameters extracted from the data were the linear and angular acceleration, velocity and position of the head center of mass and the C7-T1 joint axis. Since the instrumentation was mounted externally, the kinematic parameters were measured externally and then resolved to the estimated internal location of the head center of mass and the C7-T1 joint axis assuming rigid body kinematics. The treatment of each group of data is outlined below: Head Kinematics - The head accelerometers were sensitive to DC and therefore the 1g field from the earth's gravity was subtracted from the data in order to yield the transient linear accelerations due to the impact. To determine the initial component of the 1g field on each channel, the mean signal of each accelerometer over the 100 ms preceding impact was assumed to be due to gravity. Because the 3-2-2-2 configuration yielded three independent measures of the three orthogonal components (in the 3-2-2-2 reference frame) making up the 1g field, the magnitude and direction of the 1g field were estimated from these redundant data by minimizing the sum of squares error. The resulting vector estimate of the 1g field defined the initial orientation of the head relative to the lab reference frame. An additional assumption that the x-axis of the head frame lay in the xz-plane of the global frame was required to obtain a unique rotation matrix between the two reference frames. During and after the collision, the head frame translated and rotated relative to the lab frame. The time- varying three-dimensional orientation angle between the two frames was computed by first integrating the angular acceleration (a) to obtain the angular velocity (to), and then using the orientation vector technique to update the transformation matrix between the body-fixed and inertial reference frames [35]. Because head and torso rotation were predominantly in the xz-plane, the orientation vector method produced a transformation matrix that was essentially identical to a direct double integration of the angular acceleration vector, or a method of Euler rates and angles [36], The angular acceleration (a) required for the foregoing calculation was computed using Equation 1 [28]. The instantaneous angular acceleration thus obtained was independent of the instantaneous angular velocity, which minimized accumulated errors and yielded an estimate of the angular acceleration which remained reliable for a longer duration than other methods [28]. Angular velocity of the head about the medial-lateral axis was compared with the uni-axial angular rate sensor on the head, and sagittal head angle was compared with the sagittal high speed video for agreement. a _ azi azo _ ay3 ay° 2pyl 2pri = ax3 - a*o _ az2 ~azo (1) 2pz3 2px2 a _ ay2 ~ay0 _ axl ~ ax0 2Px2 2pyl where a/ = angular acceleration along axis i, a/ = acceleration at accelerometer i, Pi = distance between accelerometers. The origin of the 3-2-2-2 assembly could not be placed at the head center of mass of a human subject. Therefore, the head acceleration computed at the origin of the 3-2-2-2 assembly was resolved to the center of gravity of the head using Equation 2 [37]. aB = aA +a x rBiA + © X (co X rB//1) (2) where aB = acceleration at point B, 2k. A = acceleration at point A, a = angular acceleration co = angular velocity, and rB/A = P°sition vector between points A and B. Torso Kinematics - The tri-axial linear accelerometer used to measure chest acceleration was sensitive to DC and was also corrected for the uniform 1g field of the earth's gravity. Unlike the head assembly correction, redundant channels were not available. The mean of each axis of the linear accelerometer over the 100 ms preceding impact was assumed to define the initial direction of the 1g field. This assumption, combined with the assumption that the x-axis of the chest accelerometry assembly was contained in the xz-plane of the global reference frame, was used to determine the rotation matrix between the initial sensor reference frame and the global frame. Torso rotation angles were computed as described earlier and used to update the rotation matrix during impact-induced motion. Unlike the head accelerometer assembly, the rotational kinematics of the torso were directly measured using a tri-axial angular rate sensor. The angular rate sensor data contained substantially more noise than the linear accelerometer data and were therefore optimally filtered [38,39] before computation. Digital low-pass filters based on the data of five subjects were used to filter the angular velocity data of all subjects. After filtering, the angular acceleration was computed from the angular velocity by calculating the slope between the instantaneous angular velocity 10 ms before and after the time of interest. Intervals shorter than 10 ms produced unrealistically short, high angular acceleration peaks. Because the contribution of the (a x r) term in 3881</page><page sequence="6">Equation 2 to the acceleration at the C7-T1 joint axis was small, the differentiation process was not refined. The sensitive axes of the tri-axial linear accelerometer used for measuring the torso acceleration did not pass through a single point. Although torso transducer rotation was not large, the accelerations of the y- and z-axes were corrected to a single point on the sensitive x-axis using equation 2. This correction was typically less than 10 percent of the peak signal, but was performed because the internal offset of the sensitive axes was large (about 15 mm) relative to the distance from the sensor origin to the C7-T1 joint axis (typically about 90 mm). Linear accelerations at the C7-T1 joint axis were then calculated from the measured torso transducer signals in the same manner as for the head. High Speed Video Data - Reflective target data extracted from the high-speed video were first corrected for camera lens barrel distortion using a 5th order polynomial (odd terms only) [40]. The polynomial coefficients were determined using a 10 cm by 10 cm grid covering the camera's field of view (about 0.90 m by 1.20 m at the centerline of the target vehicle's seat), and then minimizing the sum of squares error between the actual and digitized grid. Because the camera-to-subject distance was relatively short (5 m), the data for targets located off the mid-sagittal plane were also adjusted for parallax [40]. The camera axis was assumed to be perpendicular to the plane of vehicle and occupant motion. Since a target could not be positioned a priori over the origins of the head and torso reference frames, the path of these points was calculated assuming a fixed position relative to the actual markers. Collision severity - Vehicle position data from the 5th wheels were differentiated across a 16 ms window, and speed change was then determined from scale plots of vehicle speed versus time [41]. The bumper load-cell sensor bias, estimated as the mean signal over the 100 ms preceding impact, was removed from the data before summing the left and right load cells to obtain total collision force. The sum was then integrated and divided by the vehicle mass to confirm vehicle speed change. Some parameters were measured using multiple methods to confirm the response. For instance, head angle about the y-axis was computed from the 3-2-2-2 accelerometers and the uni-axial angular rate sensor, and then compared to the high-speed video data. The acceleration data presented in this paper were computed from the accelerometer and angular rate sensors, and the position and angle data were extracted from the high speed video. Velocity data were computed by integrating acceleration rather than differentiating displacement data because of the inherent random-noise-reducing effect of the integration process. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS - Gender and speed change were the primary variables in this study. The null hv/nnthococ va/oto that naithar npnrlpr nnr ÇïnppH r.hannp affected the kinematic response of an occupant exposed to a low-speed, rear-end collision. Peak amplitude and time-to-peak amplitude were extracted for peaks common to the absolute and relative linear and angular acceleration, velocity and position data of the head and C7-T1 of each subject. The effect of gender and speed change on the amplitude and time of each common peak in the kinematic response was tested using a single analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each of the two extracted measures. The covariance of peak amplitude and time-to-peak amplitude was examined to ensure that single tests were valid. A method of unweighted means was used to account for the unequal samples in each cell of the ANOVA [42]. To ensure the probability of a false positive was less than 0.05 across the 31 peaks examined, a Bonferroni adjustment was used [43], Each of the 62 ANOVA tests (31 peak amplitudes and 31 time-to-peak amplitudes) was required to achieve a significance level of 0.0008 (0.05/62) to be judged significantly related to speed change or gender. RESULTS Forty-two subjects were exposed to impacts. Three subjects withdrew between their 4 km/h and 8 km/h tests, and all subjects who underwent the 8 km/h test first completed the study. Impacts at . the 4 and 8 km/h level were repeatably produced (Table 2). Position and angle data obtained from high speed video were acquired for all subjects (Table 3a). Because of the nature of the accelerometer calculations, a failure of one transducer rendered the test data incomplete. Incomplete data were collected for six tests, which reduced the number of subjects for whom complete transducer data were recorded (Table 3b). The full data set was used to calculate the position-based Table 2. Vehicle speed and collision properties at the 4 and 8 km/h level. All properties were significantly different at the two levels.

Only sagittal plane motion was considered in this analysis, which yielded 27 kinematic response signals: nine signals (ax, az, vx, vz, sx, sz, ay, wy, 0y) each for the absolute motion of the head, absolute motion of the C7-T1, and relative motion of the head with respect to C7-T1. Motion out of the sagittal plane, i.e., translational motion along the y-axis and rotational motion about the x and z axes, were small and varied considerably between subjects. The complete sagittal kinematic response data of all subjects is attached in Appendix A. Good agreement between double-integrated accelerometer data and high-speed video position data was achieved for the kinematic response of the head and the translational components of the C7-T1 joint axis (Figure 4). Integrated angle data from the uni-axial angular rate sensor (ARS) on the head also compared well with the accelerometer and video data. Differences between accelerometer and high-speed-video data for the angle (0y) of the C7-T 1 joint axis relative to the earth were likely caused by skin motion and/or filtering. Extraneous vertical motion of the torso transducers was visible in the video; however, manually digitized check measurements of the manubrium showed that the automatically-tracked video target data relicably measured upper torso angle. Skin motion was also present in the head data of some subjects, however to a much lesser degree than in the torso data. In all tests, initial flexion between the head and the torso was observed. Although only slight flexion was present in some subjects, maximum flexion of 13 degrees from the initial orientation of the head relative to the C7-T1 joint axis was reached by some subjects. Relative horizontal motion between the head and C7-T1 joint axis also occurred in all subjects. Forward acceleration of the C7-T1 origin typically began about 25 to 35 ms after impact, coincident with vertical acceleration of the head relative to the earth. Forward horizontal acceleration and angular acceleration of the head relative to the earth began about 10 to 30 ms after the onset of vertical head acceleration. Observable positive C7-T1 joint axis rotation relative to the earth began about 30 to 40 ms after impact and forward horizontal displacement began about 20 ms later. Positive head rotation relative to the earth was detected about 50 to 70 ms after impact, after 1 to 5 degrees of flexion between the head and C7-T1 joint axis had developed from torso motion. Forward horizontal head displacement with respect to the earth was not observed until about 80 to 110 ms after impact. By this time, between 1 to 5 cm of rearward horizontal translation had developed between the head center of mass and the C7-T1 origin. Maximum rearward horizontal translation of the head's center of mass relative to the C7-T1 origin varied between 2.5 and 11 cm. Head restraint contact was made in 80 of 81 tests. Excluding one male at the 4 km/h level who did not contact the head restraint, the mean time from bumper contact to head restraint contact was 1 1 8 ± 1 8 ms at the 4 km/h level and 94 ± 13 ms at the 8 km/h level. The duration of head restraint contact was 95 ± 17 ms at the 4 km/h level and 103 ± 13 ms at the 8 km/h level. At head restraint contact, the head was rotating rearward and just beginning to translate forward in the global reference frame. Relative to the C7-T1 joint axis, however, head restraint contact was made with the head in its initially flexed and retracted position. Rearward rotation (extension) of the head relative to the C7-T1 joint axis did not begin until after head restraint contact, and in about 20 percent of the tests, the head never extended rearward of its original orientation relative to the C7-T 1 joint axis. Peak horizontal head acceleration relative to the earth occurred during head restraint contact for all subjects who contacted the head restraint. Peak horizontal head speed relative to the earth averaged about 1.9 times the target vehicle speed change across all subjects and both speed changes. The peak horizontal speed of the C7-T1 joint axis relative to the earth averaged about 1.6 times the vehicle speed change. Thirty-one response peaks common to all subjects were analyzed for the effect of speed change and gender on peak kinematic response (Figure 5). Some kinematic response signals contained multiple peaks common to all subjects, whereas other signals were excluded from the analysis because of dissimilar subject response. At the adjusted significance level of 0.0008, the amplitude of 28 peaks and the time of 27 peaks varied significantly with vehicle speed change (Tables 4a and 4b). The amplitude of seven peaks and the time to eight peaks varied significantly with gender. The interaction term was not significant for the amplitude or time of any of the selected peaks. DISCUSSION The number of subjects in this study allowed statistical comparisons to be made between the kinematic response of male and female subjects at the two selected speed changes in rear-end automobile collisions. The larger peak amplitudes demonstrated at the 8 km/h level compared to the 4 km/h level for most of the kinematic parameters tested provides insight into the effect of collision severity on the kinematic response of human subjects in low-speed rear-end collisions. However, the importance of the absolute values of each peak and the relationship of each kinematic parameter to the injury mechanism causing WAD has not yet been established. When addressing the potential for injury, the kinematics of the head relative to the C7-T1 joint axis may be more important than simple peak values of the head or C7-T1 joint axis relative to the earth.

This finding underscores the potential for misinterpretation of results referenced only to the global reference frame. The greater and earlier peak horizontal acceleration of the head and C7-T1 joint axis (relative to the earth) of the female subjects and the larger and later peak head extension of the male subjects were consistent with the larger body mass and head size (and therefore head mass) of the male subjects and the correspondingly lower frequency response of the seat back/occupant system. Both seat back stiffness and occupant mass govern the frequency response of the seat back, and variations in seat back stiffness have been shown to amplify or attenuate differential motion between the head and neck [44]. Greater male peak head extension may also be related to a lower relative head restraint position for the male subjects than for the female subjects. The reason for the gender differences found for other response peaks is less clear. A regression analysis which incorporates anthropometry, seated posture, and head restraint adjustment may yield insight into the parameters responsible for the gender differences observed in this study. Differences in the horizontal distance between the back of the head and the front of the head restraint, known as "backset", have been shown to affect head neck motion using a Hybrid III dummy equipped with a RID neck [44], Backsets greater than 10 cm have correlated with increased neck symptom duration [45], and lower vertical head restraint position has correlated with an increased incidence of neck injuries in rear-end collisions [46]. Because the adjusted seat back angle and head restraint position relative to the seat in the present study were fixed, inter-subject differences in anthropometry and posture resulted in variable horizontal and vertical head restraint positions. For all subjects, however, the top of the head restraint was above the ears and backset was less than 10 cm. Both head restraint backset and vertical position were potential confounding variables in this study and warrant additional investigation. In an observational study of the motoring public, 15 percent of observed drivers had backsets less than 10 cm, and only 10 percent of drivers had a combination of backset less than 10 cm and top of the head restraint adjusted above the ears [47], The subjects in the current study therefore represent the small segment of the mAfArinn nnKli^ ti/ifH "nntimol" ho'íH rnełroinł nrnfürtinn IIIUIUIIII^ puuiio vviui wpili i tai i icau I vůli anu pi wiwwuwi i. The observed initial flexion between the head and torso was a result of torso rotation preceding head rotation: torso rotation began about 30 to 40 ms after impact, whereas head rotation was not observed until about 50 to 70 ms after impact. The position and angle of the head and the position of the upper torso initially remained stationary relative to the earth, while the pelvis and lower torso were accelerated forward by the seat /II Al /I I //i - Figure 6.

This forward motion of the pelvis and lower torso set up a positive rotation of the torso about the y-axis and resulted in flexion between the stationary head and rotating torso. Rearward horizontal translation of the head relative to the C7-T1 joint axis was prominent in all subjects (Figure 6) and was greater in male subjects than female subjects. A comparison between the amount of rearward horizontal translation of the head center of mass relative to the C7-T1 joint axis and the active range of motion in retraction of the subjects in this study (3.1 ± 0.9 cm [25]) suggests that dynamic retraction may have approached or exceeded the subjects' active range of motion. Although some of the rearward horizontal translation between the head's center of mass and C7-T1 origin was the result of head extension relative to the C7-T1 joint axis, rearward horizontal translation occurred in all subjects whereas relative head extension did not. In subjects whose head remained flexed during the entire impact, horizontal translation between the top of the cervical spine (base of the skull) and the C7-T1 origin may have been larger than indicated by the horizontal translation between the head center of mass and the C7-T 1 joint axis. It has been previously reported that small amounts of horizontal translation between the head and C7-T1 bring the craniovertebral junction into maximal flexion and that translation of the head relative to the torso may cause damage at the craniovertebral junction [48]. Additional work is needed to determine whether dynamic retraction of the top of the cervical column relative to the C7-T1 origin exceeded active range of motion, and whether this translation was related to symptom production. Previous research has reported that the head of some test subjects never reached anatomical extension relative to the torso (extension beyond the head/torso orientation when standing upright) [13]. The current data showed that the head of some subjects never rotated rearward of its initial "anatomically flexed" position relative to the C7-T1 joint axis. Additional work is roniiiraH tr» Hûfûrmiriû u/hałhar łhie nałłorn of motion ufoe associated with symptom production, and whether the flexed position of the head relative to the C7-T1 joint axis at head restraint contact contributed to a WAD injury mechanism. Peak head extension relative to C7-T1 was less than 20 degrees from the initial flexed position of the head relative to the torso for all subjects. Active neck range of motion in extension for the subjects in this study was 70 ± 8 degrees from the anatomical neutral position [25]. None of the subjects exceeded their extension range of motion. This finding indicates that hyperextension of the neck was not the mechanism responsible for transient symptoms produced in this study [25], and is consistent with other studies producing transient symptoms without hyperextension [11,12,13]. The torso and head over-speed observed in the current data appear to be larger than that qualitatively reported in a previous human subject study [12]. Torso over-speed was previously described as slightly greater than the vehicle's post-impact speed and head over- speed was described as slightly greater than torso speed. Over-speed is likely a function of seat back elasticity and frequency response, and differences in seat back properties between studies may account for the greater over-speed found in the current data. The statistical findings of this research cannot be compared directly to the results of previous kinematic investigations into low-speed rear-end collisions because no previous studies examined gender and collision severity effects, largely due to small test populations. A general comparison between peak kinematic parameters observed in this study and those reported in the literature was possible (Table 5). This comparison was restricted largely to the kinematic response of the head relative to the earth except for two studies [14,15] that reported acceleration measured at the approximate location of the C7 spinous process and on the frontal surface of the chest respectively. Peak head acceleration varied widely between the studies in Table 5, perhaps due to differences hûkii/aAn nra_imr»o^ł mi icrlû rAnłroołinn ^rkllicirvr» iuguli wu ivy wwivi 1 1 iii iw w i i w ii lwi ii no |yauvi i i w i nivsuvsii nag ly&amp;ivt vwl I pi ü II I ipai/l IIIUOV/IC VsvSI III Gils Uly I I, V/UIIIOIUII 3888</page><page sequence="13">severity, seat backs and head restraints. Angular acceleration of the head relative to the earth was higher in the current study, however the data from other studies presented in Table 5 were calculated from high speed film rather than accelerometers. Higher peak head angular velocity and greater head extension in the data of McConnell et al, [12] may be related to a higher head position relative to the head restraint used in their tests. Head extension compared favorably with data reported by Szabo et al, [13,14] who used a head restraint height similar to that used in the present study. Peak acceleration at the base of the cervical spine also compared well with the limited previous data [14,15], although the comparison may not be valid because the data were not measured at or resolved to the same points. This study examined the sagittal plane response of the head and torso of ideally seated occupants with a well-adjusted head restraint in an aligned vehicle collision within a single vehicle and seat position. Additional studies are needed to quantify the effect on the kinematic response of the many variables controlled in the present study. SUMMARY Head and torso kinematic response data for 21 male and 21 female subjects exposed to a controlled series of low-speed rear-end automobile collisions have been presented. Initial flexion between the head and torso was observed in all subjects. Retraction of the head center of mass relative to the C7-T1 joint axis was present in all subjects, whereas extension of the head relative to its initial position with respect to the C7-T1 joint axis was not present in all subjects. Significant gender differences existed between the peak amplitude and time-to-peak amplitude for about one quarter of the thirty-one common peaks in the kinematic response data. Significant differences between the two collision severities were demonstrated for both the amplitude and time of most common peaks in the kinematic response data. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study is part of a larger study examining the kinematic, kinetic, and muscle responses, and clinical outcome of subjects exposed to low-speed rear-end automobile collisions.
