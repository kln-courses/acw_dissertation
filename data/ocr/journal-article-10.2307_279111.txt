<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPORTS COMMENT BY ADOVASIO J. M. Adovasio Comments on Madsen's article. Though Madsen is to be highly commended for focusing our attention on "Fremont-Sevier" sub- sistence and settlement patterns, I am afraid that I do not concur with his central thesis or, in- deed, with any of the "conclusions" derived therefrom. Specifically, I believe that it is possible to explicitly define a Fremont cultural entity artifactually and, further, that such an entity would subsume Madsen's Sevier, Fremont, and "unnamed Plains-derived" culture. Additionally, it can be demonstrated that this entity represents an in situ evolution out of or from one or more local Archaic populations. In several earlier works (Adovasio 1970a, 1970b, 1971, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978a, 1978b), I have maintained that the Fremont culture can best be defined in terms of its most diagnostic and technologically distinctive artifact category-basketry. For those unfamiliar with these works, an abbreviated summary of my position follows. THE FREMONT BASKETRY INDUSTRY The term basketry herein encompasses several distinct kinds of items, including rigid and semirigid containers (or baskets proper), matting, and bags. Matting includes items that are essentially two-dimensional or flat, whereas baskets are three- dimensional. Bags may be viewed as intermediate forms because they are two-dimensional when empty and three-dimensional when filled. As Driver (1961:159) points out, these artifacts can be treated as a unit because the overall technique of manufacture is the same in all instances. Specifically, all forms of basketry are manually woven without any frame or loom. Because all basketry is woven, it is technically a class or variety of textile (see Emery 1966), though that term is sometimes restricted to cloth fabrics. In the following pages, the technical characteristics, distribution, origins, and demise of Fre- mont basketry are discussed, and comparisons are offered with earlier, contemporary, and later basketry assemblages from the same area. It should be noted that I have examined virtually every piece of Fremont basketry in existence, in both public and private collections, and it is upon this analysis that the following comments are predicated. TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS Two of the three major subclasses of basket weaves are represented in the Fremont basketry assemblage: coiling and twining. The third subclass, plaiting, is wholly absent. The salient techni- cal features of Fremont coiling and twining are presented below by subclasses. (Those unfamiliar with the descriptive terminology employed herein are advised to consult Adovasio [1977].) Coiling Coiling is the numerically dominant subclass of Fremont basketry and is represented at all Fre- mont sites where basketry has been preserved. All extant examples of Fremont coiling were analyzed, where feasible, for the following attributes: 1. basket wall (foundation) technique; J. M. Adovasio, Department of Anthropology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260 723</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 2. stitch type; 3. method of starting; 4. work direction; 5. work surface; 6. rim finish; 7. splice type; 8. decorative patterns and mechanics of decoration; 9. form; 10. wear patterns-function; and 11. material. The results of the attribute analysis summarized above indicate the following: Basket wall (foundation) technique. Eight basket wall or foundation techniques are represented in Fremont coiling. The frequency of these techniques by site is presented in Table 1. As indicated, four foundation types (close-coiling, half-rod-and-bundle-stacked foundation; close- coiling, half-rod-and-welt-stacked foundation; close-coiling, whole-rod foundation; and close- coiling, three-rod-bunched foundation) account collectively for 95.74% of the sample. Of these, one technique-close-coiling, half-rod-and-bundle-stacked foundation-accounts for 50% of the entire sample. This particular foundation is represented at all but two Fremont sites and appears to be the preferred or standard Fremont coiling technique (see Adovasio 1970a, 1970b, 1971, 1974). The four remaining coiling foundations are statistically insignificant and, as will be shown below, are probably intrusive. Stitch type. Five types of stitches occur in Fremont coiling. These include include interlocking, nonin- terlocking, split intentionally on the nonwork surface, split on both surfaces, and intricate- interlocking. Of these, the most common are noninterlocking, split intentionally on the nonwork surface, and interlocking. The latter stitch type is restricted entirely to whole-rod foundation basketry which is sewn with no other type of stitch. Methods of starting. All extant Fremont coiled baskets have been initiated with a normal or continuous coil center. Work direction. In the vast majority of Fremont coiled baskets (80%), the sewing proceeds from right to left, though the reverse technique is not unknown. Work surface. All Fremont trays are worked on the concave surface, as are shallow bowls, whereas deeper bowls and carrying baskets are worked on the convex surface. Rim finish. Most Fremont coiled baskets are finished with self rims, though false braid rims either in a 1/1 or 2/2 herringbone do occur occasionally. Splice type. Marked preferences for specific splice types are readily discernible in Fremont coiling. In all instances, the preferred splicing techniques are identical to those employed by preceding Desert Archaic populations from the same area. Dominant types include fag ends and moving ends bound under, fag ends clipped short and moving ends bound under, and less common- ly, fag ends and moving ends clipped short. Decorative patterns and mechanics. Only two baskets in the entire sample are decorated in any way. These include a bowl fragment with a chevron design produced by sewing feathers onto the convex surface and a tray fragment with a single circuit of stitches which have been dyed red. Form. The Fremont produced a wide range of vessel forms including very shallow circular trays, shallow to moderately deep globular bowls, and deep circular carrying baskets. Of these, the nearly flat tray is the most frequently encountered form. Wear patterns-function. Analysis of wear patterns on Fremont coiling indicates that virtually 100%/o of the shallow trays were employed in parching, whereas the other forms seem to have been used for general storage and transportation. No indications of cooking in baskets are ap- parent. As noted elsewhere (see Adovasio 1970a, 1970b) half-rod-and-bundle, close-coiled baskets are naturally watertight due to the expansion of the bundle when damp; hence, the use of con- tainers produced via this technique for water storage can be safely inferred. Material. Throughout the range of the Fremont culture, the preferred material both for rods 724 [Vol. 44, No. 4,1979]</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS Table 1.

Bundles were generally composed of Apocynum or Asclepias or, more rarely, of Juniperus or Yucca. Twining Basketry produced via twining techniques is relatively uncommon in most Fremont sites and frequently is not represented at all. All extant Fremont twining was analyzed for the following at- tributes: 1. number and composition of warps engaged at each weft crossing; 2. number and composition of wefts; 3. spacing of the weft rows (open or-close); 4. pitch of the weft rows (S or Z); 5. method of starting; 6. insertion of new elements; 7. selvages; 8. form; 9. wear patterns-function; 10. decorative patterns and mechanics of decoration; and 11. material. The results of this attribute analysis are presented below. Construction techniques. Seven basic twining techniques were employed by Fremont weavers. The incidence of these techniques by site is presented in Table 2. As noted, only one technique, open diagonal twining with Z-twist wefts, occurs with any frequency, and then only at a single site. The remaining techniques occur in very limited numbers, and only one technique, open diagonal twining with S-twist wefts, occurs in as many as three sites. The greatest variety in twining is apparent in the assemblage from Yampa Canyon, where four techniques occur, fol- lowed by Hogup Cave and the Promontory Caves, which are represented by three techniques each. Warps are generally single elements in all types of simple twining and paired elements in all in- stances of diagonal twining. Wefts are inevitably paired in all types of twining-no examples of trebled or other multiple weft patterns have ever been found. Cordage is commonly utilized for wefts in the construction of matting. Though both S- and Z-twist wefts occur in Fremont twining, with notably marked preferences that vary from one site to another, S twist generally predomi- nates in the assemblage. Space does not permit discussion of other construction details such as method of starting, inser- tion of new elements, etc. (For these particulars the reader is encouraged to consult Steward [1937]; Burgh and Scoggin [1948].) However, some comments on selvages are warranted. Fremont selvages tend to be extremely varied; no one side or edge finish is clearly in the majori- ty. At most sites, warps are simply truncated after the final weft row or folded back into the body of the fabric and then truncated. More elaborate end selvages occur in the Promontory Caves' assemblage; these include a variety of reinforced edges sewn with cordage (see Steward 1937). Side selvages on mats invariably have weft rows folded down parallel to the lateral margins and sewn back to form the next weft row. Form, wear patterns and function. The majority of Fremont twining is in the form of matting or, more rarely, flexible bags. Rigid twined containers are virtually unknown. No diagnostic wear patterns are apparent on any type of twining, though frequent indications of mending, notably in the bags, attest to heavy use and subsequent re-use. Decorative patterns and mechanics of decoration. As with Fremont coiling, the use of any decorative embellishment, with the exception of modified selvages, is wholly lacking in the twin- ing industry. Material. Warps in Fremont twined matting are generally made of Scirpus americanus or, much more rarely, Phragmites communis, Rlhus trilobata, or Salix. Wefts are usually formed of Juniperus utahensis or, in the case of cordage wefts, Asciepias, Apocynum, or Artemisia. Salix is [Vol. 44, No. 4,1979] 726</page><page sequence="5">REPORTS Table 2.

In the production of bags, Scirpus again is the favored material for both wefts and warps. DISTRIBUTION, CHRONOLOGY, AND INTERNAL CORRELATIONS Distribution Typical Fremont coiled basketry is represented in all five of the Fremont regional variants defined in Utah (see Marwitt 1970) as well as in southeastern Nevada and northwestern Col- orado. Beyond the "normal" limits of the Fremont culture proper, Fremont coiling has been recovered in southern Idaho and southwestern Wyoming. As reported elsewhere (Adovasio 1972), Fremont coiling is virtually never encountered south of the Colorado or Virgin Rivers, nor is it known in northeastern Nevada. Fremont twining is severely limited in occurrence and is generally confined to northern Utah and northwestern Colorado. Although it is reasonable to conclude that twining was manufactured throughout the range of the Fremont, evidence to that effect is lacking. Chronology Coiled basketry was produced throughout the entire time span of the Fremont culture, that is, from ca. A.D. 400 to ca. 1300. The industry disappeared or was replaced by intrusive industries (see below) differentially, becoming extinct in the Uinta area around A.D. 950 and in other areas by the end of the thirteenth century. Presumably, twining was also produced over this time span, at least in the northern sectors of the Fremont range. Certain developmental trends are discernible over the 900-year period during which Fremont coiled basketry was produced. Notable among these are the gradual shift from mixed to almost uniformly right-to-left work direction, the increasing preference for half-rod-and-bundle founda- tion over all others, and the increasing tendency to employ noninterlocking or intentionally split stitches on the nonwork surface. At present, it is not possible to delineate any trends that may have been operative in the twining industry. Internal correlations Though not extremely pronounced, regional preferences definitely existed among the various populations of Fremont basket makers. As Table 1 indicates, whole-rod foundation coiling was somewhat more common in the Uinta Basin and the Parowan Valley than elsewhere. Half-rod- and-welt-stacked foundation likewise enjoyed differential popularity, again being common in the Parowan Valley and somewhat scarce, or absent, in other Fremont regional centers. Preferences for specific stitch types are also discernible. Interlocking stitches are generally more common in the northern Fremont variants, whereas noninterlocking stitches are clearly favored in the south, particularly in the Parowan Valley. The uneven distribution of S- and Z-twist wefts in the Fremont twining industry, as well as the generally northern distribution of twining, may also reflect regional specialization, though this conclusion is tenuous at best. EXTERNAL CORRELATIONS The basic affinities of Fremont basketry, both twined and coiled, are to earlier Desert Archaic industries from the same area. All of the basic Fremont coiling attributes, including preferred foundations, stitch types, rim finishes, methods of starting, work directions, forms, material preferences, and particularly splice types, are duplicated in earlier Archaic assemblages from Utah. Similarly, all of the twining attributes may be observed in Archaic assemblages from the eastern Great Basin (see Adovasio 1970a, 1970b, 1971, 1974). Although the persistence of one or another of the aforementioned technical attributes from late Archaic into Fremont times could be 728 [Vol. 44, No. 4,1979]</page><page sequence="7">REPORTS dismissed as fortuitous, their persistence in toto constitutes a powerful body of evidence that Fre- mont basketry is derived part and parcel out of local Archaic industries. It should be forcefully stressed that it is completely immaterial whether there was an occupa- tional hiatus (see Madsen and Berry 1975; Aikens 1976; Madsen 1978) between the end of the late Archaic in the eastern Great Basin and the beginnings of Fremont. If the eastern Great Basin was uninhabited prior to the crystallization of Fremont, which I do not for a moment believe, then the first formative "colonists" in the area "returned" with a basketry technology exactly the same as that present in the area before the alleged hiatus. Moreover, this technology is utterly dissimilar to basketry technologies elsewhere in the Great Basin, the Plateau, and the Southwest. In short, whoever the ancestors of Fremont were and whenever they entered the eastern Great Basin, their basketry was genetically eastern Great Basin Archaic in origin and not derivable from any other Great Basin, Plateau, or Southwestern source! In marked contrast to the Fremont-Desert Archaic basketry "connection" is the general lack of technical ties to any contemporary or later industries. Despite Gunnerson's (1969) allusions to the contrary, as well as the occurrence of some basic Basketmaker-Anasazi coiling foundations in Fremont sites (including all four of the minority types listed in Table 1), none of the standard P I-III techniques ever appears in any frequency anywhere in the Fremont area. Similarly, the apparent preference for closely packed, noninterlocking stitches a la Virgin Branch Anasazi by the Parowan Valley Fremont basket makers is more than offset by the utter lack of Anasazi splicing techniques or any other attribute in any of the Fremont regional variants. The technical discontinuity between Fremont and Anasazi basketry is paralleled to the north and west of the Fremont area where virtually no similarities to contiguous industries can be discerned. As to later assemblages, notably the basketry of the Numic speakers, connections are, in a word, nil. The basketry ofic populations who colted into the eastern Great Basin after A.D. 1300 iis so qualitatively different from that of their Fremont predecessors as to preclude any historical relationships. In retrospect, the Fremont twining and coiling industries represent the culmination of a long developmental continuum localized in the eastern Great Basin and relatively isolated from similar developments in adjacent areas. The absolute disappearance of Fremont basketry after A.D. 1300 thus signals not only the end of the Fremont as a cultural entity but also the extinction of a technological tradition some thousands of years old. CONCLUSIONS The data presented above require little summation. Whereas the extant lithic .and ceramic evidence does not lend itself individually or collectively to the recognition of a Fremont culture distinctive from and basically unrelated to contemporary groups like the Anasazi (Adovasio 1978b), this is not the case with the basketry data that is of, in, and by itself conclusive. As noted previously (Adovasio 1975), Fremont basketry, though it exhibits some internal variation, con- stitutes as a unit the most distinct variety of prehistoric basketry in the entire Great Basin with the possible exception of Lovelock wickerware (see Adovasio 1970a, 1970b, 1971, 1974). Because it is an established fact (see Mason 1904, Weltfish 1932; Baumhoff 1957; Rozaire 1969; Adovasio 1977, 1978a; Adovasio and Gunn 1977) that basketry is probably the single most sensitive indicator of prehistoric or ethnographic cultural integrity in the artifactual record and, further, because no two unrelated prehistoric or ethnographic cultures ever produced exactly or even nearly the same kinds of basketry with the same range of constructional attributes, the definition of a distinctive Fremont basketry industry is at once a recognition and delineation of a Fremont cultural entity. More specifically, the basketry of the Fremont is as unique and taxonomically distinct as the basketry of the Anasazi, Hohokam, or Mogollon; hence, Fremont warrants the same level of tax- onomic distinction (cf. Marwitt 1970). If Anasazi or Hohokam or Mogollon are valid prehistoric cultures, so is Fremont. 729</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Even though some (Madsen, personal communication) might think it naive or outrageous to define a prehistoric culture on the basis of a single industry or craft, namely basketry, such is my thesis in this case. Stated most simply, if it is accepted that Mono, Paiute, Panamint, Ute, or any other variety of ethnographic or prehistoric basketry can be taxonomically distinguished and recognized as the product of a distinct cultural entity, so can Fremont basketry. Although this thesis will be uncomfortable for many, particularly in light of the internal diversi- ty within Fremont as regards other aspects of material culture, subsistence practices, and ar- chitecture, it should be remembered that even greater diversity exists within Anasazi (Adovasio et al. 1979), Mogollon, and Hohokam. In conclusion, the student of Fremont is advised to consider the basketry of a well-known ethnographic, linguistic, and ethnic entity in the Southwest-the Apache. Despite the fact that great differet ieences in material culture and subsistence practices are evident from band to band, notably as one moves west to east, the basketry of any or all of these groups is still recognizably Apache (Douglas 1934). Apache basketry cannot be confused by a specialist with the basketry of any of its neighbors despite very close similarities in many other aspects of material culture. This is also the case with Fremont. While I am in no way suggesting any relationship whatsoever be- tween Fremont and Apache, I am stating that for comparative purposes their situations are population that constructs Fremont basketry is Fremont no matter what their subsistence prac- tices happen to be. Given the foregoing, I do not believe that the extant subsistence and settlement pattern disparities noted by Madsen warrant the division of Fremont into two or three separate tax- onomic entities, nor do I find it necessary to seek Fremont origins in any area outside the eastern Great Basin.

It seems to me that the question he actually raises is that of the taxonomic level at which contrasts exist within this culture, and between it and other entities similarly conceived. The real thrust of his argument is simply that the relationship between the local cultures subsumed under the term Fremont is more distant than others have implied. Clearly a recognizable Fremont entity does ex- ist, simply definable as those complexes north of the Anasazi area that share a distinctive grayware pottery tradition, anthropomorphic clay figurines, half-rod-and-bundle basketry, and maize cultivation (Wormington 1955; Marwitt 1970). That this entity has in practice been defined comparatively, by focusing on the ways in which it contrasts with the Anasazi, does not mean that it has no real existence, nor does it mean that our belief in its existence is a mere accident of the history of archaeological research. Surely comparison and contrast are still to be reckoned among the respected tools of our discipline. Madsen's use of this argument does, however, serve to emphasize his conviction that the local cultures that have been grouped under the term Fre- C.
