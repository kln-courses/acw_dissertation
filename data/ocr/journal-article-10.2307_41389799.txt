Highlighting the prominence of orality and incorporation in relation to ethics, politics, and the law, the two images of the parched woman and the son of man seem to contain in a nutshell some of Derrida's major engagements and concerns Discourse , 30.1 8c 2, Winter 8c Spring 2008, pp. 226-241.

First and foremost, Derrida draws on a psycho- analytic concept of orality because it is the foundation of a more encompassing theory of incorporation and mourning. As is well known, Derrida draws on the work of Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok, which he introduced and elaborated linguistically into a the- ory of cryptonymy and cryptography. The traces of Abraham and Torok's work on mourning and incorporation, which Derrida hon- ors in "Fors,"4 continue to pervade his work in seminal ways. But so do the traces of Melanie Klein's work on infantile fantasies and the early formation of internal objects - traces that are, with the excep- tion of Gayatri Spivak, much less recognized in the critical recep- tion of Derrida. In this vein, Derrida's psychophilosophical reflections on incorporation reach back to the mouth as an organ and figure that prepares the ground for a gradually acquired divi- sion between self and other. The mouth and, more generally, the capacity for literal and figurative incorporation are instrumental in the constitution of good and bad internal objects and the boundary between auto-affection and hetero-affection, as well as the forma- tion of early fantasy life. Throughout his work, Derrida makes use of the challenge psychoanalysis presents to a rethinking of orality in its philosophical and epistemological implications. He explores the oral aspects of encounters between self and other from cannibalism and incorporation to hospitality and appropriative consumption. Incorporation, digestion, and elimination provide the primordial terms for an ethical imperative in which the psychological and the political are inextricably intertwined. Most importantly, considera- tions of psychoanalytic concepts of orality shape Derrida's decon- struction of conventional notions of voice and writing from its inception in "Voice and Phenomena" and Of Grammatology to his lat- est works on psychoanalysis, autoimmunity, cruelty, war, and human rights. The mouth lends itself to be used both as an instrument of voracious attack in the service of the work of death and as an instru- ment of sociality, hospitality, and an ethics of friendship in the serv- ice of the work of life. Eating together, taking the other in, eating what the other eats, and understanding what it means to eat well are as important as incorporating the other in an act of mourning. The mouth, however, is also the site of utterance and the gener- ation of sounds, the voice and the cry. In Of Grammatology, Derrida refers to the inarticulate cry as that which one has always excluded, pushing it into the area of animali ty or madness.5 Posing the problem of the cry and of speech (voice) within the history of life is part of Der- rida's larger concern in opening language to the trace of the other, the unconscious or differance. In her introduction to Of Grammatology,</page><page sequence="3">228 Gabriele Schwab one of the first systematic assessments of Derrida's relationship to psychoanalysis, Gayatri Spivak writes, "For Derrida ... a text, as we recall, whether 'literary,' psychic,' 'anthropological,' or otherwise, is a play of presence and absence, a place of the effaced trace."6 This concern with the effaced trace of the other calls for a concept of writ- ing and speech able to discern what Spivak calls the "trace-structure of expression."7 Derrida's concern with the inarticulate cry further calls for a concept of writing that includes animality and madness, and, more generally, primordiality, or what Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus call the "presignifying semiotic," which they say is "much closer to 'natural' codings operating without signs."8 For Deleuze and Guattari, this presignifying semiotic is a decolonizing force that "fosters a pluralism or polyvocality of forms of expression that prevents any power takeover by the signifier and preserves expressive forms particular to content; thus forms of corporeality, gesturality, rhythm, dance, and rite coexist heterogeneously with the vocal form."9 This positive valuation in Deleuze and Guattari of an inclusive concept of writing that resists the confining force of the sig- nifying and representational regime bears certain affinities to Der- rida's own inclusive concept of writing: " [W] e say 'writing' for all that gives rise to an inscription in general, whether it is literal or not and even if what it distributes in space is alien to the order of the voice: cinematography, choreography, of course, but also pictorial, musi- cal, sculptural 'writing.'"10 Finally, we must take the inclusiveness of Derrida 's concept of writing in yet another direction; namely, the one indicated in the opening epigraph that insists on the inclusion of death as a supple- ment shaping the interior of speech. It is this marking of speech by an unspoken trace or supplement that introduces a psychoanalytic perspective into Derrida 's concept of writing. In his chapter on Rousseau, "That Dangerous Supplement," Derrida names psycho- analysis as a crucial theory that defines the system of his own writing: "I am within the history of psychoanalysis as I am within Rousseau's text ... we operate today within a certain network of significations marked by psychoanalytic theory, even if we do not master it and even if we are assured of never being able to master it perfectly."1 1 In turn, this recognition leads Derrida to define for a "psychoanalysis to come" the difficult task to "elucidate the law of its own appurte- nance to metaphysics and Western culture."12 Many of Derrida's reflections on the political challenge of psy- choanalysis converge around issues of incorporation, including the incorporation of the law. Incorporation is not only a psychological concept related to taking in the other; it is also an economic and</page><page sequence="4">Derrida , The Parched Woman , awá ¿Ač Son of Man 229 political concept deeply critical of the laws that govern writing within the history of Western culture, colonialism, and global capi- talism. The political economy of incorporation is in fact suggestively evoked in Derrida's use of the images referred to earlier of the parched woman who drinks the inky dust of the law and the son of man who fills his entrails with the scroll of the law, which has become sweet as honey in his mouth. Together the two images point to the political dimension of incorporation, including differences in gen- der politics. Women and men alike incorporate the law and assimi- late it from within their entrails, so to speak. Yet, whereas the woman in the image becomes parched from the law's dust and thus deprived of the fluid vitality of life, the man turns the scrolls of law to his advantage after making them taste like honey in his mouth. Whereas the woman's act illustrates the draining of life in willful sub- jection to the law, the man's act bespeaks the sweet taste of the psy- chic life of power. Two kinds of appropriation are at work here: by "drinking" the law, the woman becomes (like) the law and this "becoming law" inverts the economy of consumption. In consuming the law, the parched woman lets herself be consumed by it. The "inky dust of law" dries out her life juices and makes her shriveled up, withered, sterile, and unproductive. Her very skin becomes parchment, as if to be inscribed by the law. The skin as a surface receives inscriptions from inner and outer experiences. We recall that Freud defined the ego as first and foremost a bodily ego, as the projection of a surface. Reduced to the egological construction of the self, the woman with parchment skin loses the vital flow of life. She is becoming parchment surface ready for the inscriptions of the dusty ink of law. In a sense it is as though she became the scrolls of law. By contrast, the man turns the law into nurture and jouissance. We might imagine him as the supplementary figure to Kafka's man before the law. Seen in this light, filling one's entrails with the law might perhaps already be a reaction formation against being denied entry to the law. Of course, we must analyze the incorporation of the law psy- choanalytically in order to see the discontents it will inevitably cause, even as it tastes sweet like honey. The identification with the law might indeed taste like honey because it nourishes the illusion of liv- ing a psychic life of (patriarchal) power, but the inverse of this power is that it is already grounded in a subjection to the law. And while fill- ing his entrails with the scroll of the law might well initiate the son of man's "becoming subject," it will also guarantee his further sub- jection to the law. The sweet taste of honey then might be soured by the whole ambivalence that, as Judith Butler puts it, "forms the bind</page><page sequence="5">230 Gabriele Schwab of agency": "Where conditions of subordination make possible the assumption of power, the power assumed remains tied to those con- ditions, but in an ambivalent way; in fact, the power assumed may at once retain and resist that subordination."13 Perhaps the subordi- nation of the woman who drinks the inky dust of law cannot afford her the same access to power and therefore dries out the flow of her lively forces. Derrida 's choice to juxtapose these two opposing images pointedly exhibits the gendering of the psychic life of power within the phallogocentrism of patriarchal cultures. In fact, Derrida's use of the image of the parched woman carries a certain affinity to an image Deleuze and Guattari choose to describe women's subjection to molar politics. A woman's attempt to confine herself to trying to win back her own history and subjectiv- ity by making her appearance as a mere subject of enunciation, they warn, "does not function without drying up a spring or stopping a flow."14 And, they continue, "The song of life is often intoned by the driest of women, moved by ressentiment , the will to power, and cold mothering. Just as a desiccated child makes a much better child, there being no childhood flow emanating from it any longer."15 Deleuze 's and Guattari 's fluid epistemology attributes the desicca- tion of the molecular flows of desire to a subjection to the law. Within this law of molar politics with its segregation of flows into entities and identities, species and subjects, the laws of enunciation within the symbolic order always entail a psychic colonization that can only be countered with uncoded flows of desire.16 Drawing on a Deleuzian fluid epistemology, Elizabeth Grosz writes in "Psycho- analysis and Psychical Topographies," "Sexual drives result from the insertion of biological or bodily processes into networks of signifi- cation and meaning; through this immersion, they become bound up with and intimately connected to the structure of individual and collective fantasies and significations."17 Within this corporeal epis- temology, the subjection of writing to the law of networks of signifi- cation and meaning is traced back to an early bodily semiosis before the egological construction of a subject capable of saying I. Grosz reminds us that the drive deviates from the instinct "insofar as it takes for itself not a real object - food - but a fantasmatic object, an object defined primarily through the lack or absence of a real object. Freud describes this in the advent of sensual sucking, the first (oral) sexual drive to emerge out of the hunger instinct."18 Grosz then con- cludes, "The drive is able to imitate or prop itself on the instinct because it is able to borrow the sites, sources, and aims of the instincts, inserting a new fantasy object in place of the object of need, enervating the circuit or flow between the external object, the</page><page sequence="6">Derrida, The Parched Woman , and the Son of Man 231 bodily erotogenic source, and the fantasmatic link between them."19 The birth of desire, in other words, occurs at the interstices between bodily semiosis and the creation of fantasy objects. To retain the molecular flows of desire, according to Deleuze and Guattari and Deleuzian feminists like Grosz, requires resisting the subjugation of desire to the law. For Derrida, desire can be retained and traced in forms of cor- poreality as gesturality, rhythm, dance, rite, and perhaps even cry - forms that coexist heterogeneously with the vocal form and constitute a bodily semiosis with its own intentionality. But how does this semiosis relate to specific organs such as the mouth or to the face and faciality? Derrida begins The Ear of the Other with a quote from Zarathustra: "[F] or there are human beings who lack every- thing, except one thing of which they have too much - human beings who are nothing but a big eye or a big mouth."20 Deleuze and Guattari write, The face is the Icon proper to the signifying regime, the reterritorialization internal to the system. The signifier reterritorializes on the face The sig- nifier is always facialized. Faciality reigns materially over that whole con- stellation of significances and interpretations Conversely, when the face is effaced, when the faciality traits disappear, we can be sure that we have entered another regime, other zones infinitely muter and more impercep- tible where subterranean becomings occur, becomings molecular, noctur- nal deterritorializations overspilling the limits of the signifying system.21 Among these becomings, three figure most prominently because they challenge the egological construction of the subject: becoming animal, becoming woman, and becoming child. According to Deleuze and Guattari, psychoanalysis has never fully understood these becomings. Psychoanalysts, they claim, "do not see the reality of a becoming animal, that it is affect in itself, the drive in person, and represents nothing."22 In Deleuze and Guattari, this antirepre- sentational theory of molecular becomings becomes the foundation of a theory of individuation that, rather than supporting an egolog- ical constitution of a self, consists of pure movement and affect. "The individuation of a life is not the same as the individuation of the subject that leads it or serves as its support," they claim, and finally conclude, "Here, the elements in play find their individua- tion in the assemblage of which they are part, independent of the form of their concept and the subjectivity of their person."23 Accord- ingly, names such as the animal or the child or the human cease to indicate discrete subjects. In becoming animal, the human exhibits the limits of any such classification by a proper name.</page><page sequence="7">232 Gabriele Schwab Deleuze 's and Guattari 's notion of "becoming animal" provides the entry point from which Derrida engages their use and critique of psychoanalysis. In his essay "The Transcendental 'Stupidity' ['Bêtise'] of Man and the Becoming-Animal According to Deleuze," Derrida focuses on the figure of the animal and the "becoming-animal." More specifically, Derrida approaches psychoanalysis and the question of the unconscious by challenging the alleged transcendental "stupidity" ("bêtise") of man. "The animal," Deleuze asserts, "is protected by spe- cific forms which prevent it from being 'stupid' (bête)."24 How, Der- rida asks, does stupidity advance to this position of being exclusively reserved to the human and to being subsequently used to mark the boundaries of the human? Derrida traces this Deleuzian assertion to the issue of freedom, will, individuation, and the capacity to say "I." Spelling out the implied argument in this position, Derrida writes, "In other words, the animal cannot be bête, stupid, because it is not free, it has no will, and its individuation, which gives it shape or form, doesn't appear on the background of a ground, which is freedom itself."25 What Derrida is most concerned with here is that, by ground- ing human "stupidity" in a concept of freedom, Deleuze links "stu- pidity" to sovereignty, cruelty and thought: "A tyrant institutionalizes stupidity, but he is the first servant of his own system and the first to be installed within it."26 Derrida thus highlights a classical motif of tyrants as slaves, a motif reminiscent of a Hegelian dialectics of mas- ter and slave that has been used and revised in psychoanalytic theo- ries of psychic colonization and "isomorphic oppression."27 Within such a dialectics, the institutionalization of stupidity, tyranny, and oppression operates as a system that affects the agent who installs the system, as well as those subjected to its modes of operation. In a simi- lar vein, Deleuze hypostasizes structures of feeling and behavior as structures of thought, arguing that "cowardice, cruelty, baseness and stupidity . . . are structures of thought as such." Derrida quotes this pas- sage and emphasizes "ave structures of thought as such"2* According to Derrida, this places Deleuze 's psychological model in the same tradi- tion of philosophy that also informs Jacques Lacan 's model of "bes- tiality" as reserved for human agents exclusively. It is a tradition, as Derrida highlights, that defines the human in distinction from the animal through the exertion of freedom and responsibility for one's actions toward others. "Properly human animality" in this tradition, Derrida continues, is "supposed to be free and responsible and not reactive, able to discern between good and evil, able to do evil for the sake of evil, and so on."29 Turning the tables on Deleuze, Derrida uses psychoanalysis for his critique of the transcendental stupidity of man. More specifi-</page><page sequence="8">Derrida, The Parched Woman , and the Son of Man 233 cally, Derrida challenges the tradition that grounds the distinction between human and animal in human freedom and responsibility from a psychoanalytic perspective. It is the question of the uncon- scious, he asserts, that makes such a grounding problematic - a question that, as he insists, Deleuze dismisses too quickly.30 If Der- rida finds it hard, as he says, to share Deleuze 's sarcasm with respect to psychoanalysis, it is because the conceptuality he analyzes in Deleuze and, for that matter, in Lacan "does not provide any assured criterion"31 to propose that only man is exposed to stupid- ity (Deleuze) or bestiality (Lacan). Derrida's tour de force consists in opening the question of free will and responsibility that grounds Deleuze 's and Lacan 's position to that of the unconscious as an agency capable of interfering with the free will.32 In this context, Derrida reminds us of Lacan 's insistence that the animal has no unconscious, and we recall here, of course, Deleuze 's insistence that the child has no unconscious either. Is it the unconscious then that marks the boundaries of the human subject? Insisting that Deleuze 's and Lacan 's "philosophy of bêtise" is inconsistent with their reference to the unconscious,33 Derrida links their position to a philosophical and anthropological tradition of thought that "sup- poses with Descartes and Kant that the animal cannot constitute itself as an I."34 Difference here is linked to differentiation and indi- viduation, and the agency of the human subject is conceived as bounded by the egological form. This form is where Derrida locates his critique: Without having to credit such or such construction of Freudian metapsy- chology, one can not reduce the whole psychological or metapsychologi- cal experience to its egological form, and one cannot reduce all life to the ego, nor every egological structure to the conscious. In the psychological or phenomenological experience, in the self-relation of the living being, the relation of the living being to itself, there is something one could call non-ego, on the one hand, and there is even, as Freud would say, the unconscious ego. So even if one doesn't want to rely on the authority of Freudian discourse, it is enough to admit that the living being is divisible and constituted by a multiplicity of assemblages, instances, forces, differ- ent intensities, and sometimes tensions and even contradictions.35 With his insistence on the limited role of the ego in psycholog- ical and metapsychological experience, in psychic life and life more generally and in consciousness in particular, Derrida emphasizes the prominence of the unconscious in defining the human as a living being that is divisible and divided against itself, driven or guided by multiple forces, instances, and intensities, and riveted by tensions and contradictions. Reaching well beyond the egological reduction</page><page sequence="9">234 Gabriele Schwab of definitions of the human, such a fluid, inclusive perspective chal- lenges with psychoanalysis not only the hegemony of consciousness but also inherited notions that rely on responsibility, sovereignty, and freedom. In this vein, Derrida resists what he calls the "hege- monic tradition from Descartes to Lévinas, including Lacan and Heidegger, and so on,"36 because for him the distinction of "man and the beast" on the basis of a distinction between response/ responsibility and reaction, sovereignty and nonsovereignty, free- dom and nonfreedom, is based on an untenable anthropocentric bias. For Derrida, this distinction becomes obsolete as soon as one admits "that there is no finite living being, human or nonhuman, that wouldn't be structured by differential forces that allow for antagonisms, resistances, repressions or simply "la raison du plus fort" (the reason/right of the strongest).37 What is at stake in Derrida's challenge to Deleuze and Lacan regarding the figure of the animal and the question of the uncon- scious is thus the problem of anthropomorphism in defining the boundaries of the human. This anthropomorphism has profound political consequences. After all, the same epistemological move has often led to other forms of exclusion, colonizing in their nature, such as the exclusion of children and indigenous people from the defined boundaries of the human. But there is more at stake in these controversies about the figure of the animal and the figure of the child as they are used to define the boundaries of the human. According to Catherine Malabou in "Polymorphism Will Never Per- vert Childhood," the stakes for Derrida lie in "the immense question of a polymorphism of difference."38 Reading this polymorphism of difference in light of Derrida's rejection of an anthropomorphism that draws the boundaries between the human and the animal along the lines of free will and responsibility, we see that the child has always escaped this anthropocentric definition. Isn't this why Deleuze sees the child as the site of deterritorialization? In this light, "becoming animal" or "becoming child" could be seen as pertaining to a process of de-anthropomorphization. If this process is poly- morphous and if some call it perverse, it is because it unfolds beyond the logic of the cogito or the self-constitution as an I. So if Deleuze and Guattari value the "becoming animal," "becoming child," and "becoming woman" as deterritorializing molecular forces, Derrida seems to suggest, then they need more radically to challenge the boundaries between the human and the animal. Operating outside the categorical limitations, differentiations, and definitions of con- sciousness, processes of becoming as envisioned by Deleuze and Guattari must beg the question of the unconscious and take into</page><page sequence="10">Derrida, The Parched Woman , and the Son of Man 235 account the divisibility, multiplicity, and difference of forces in a liv- ing being. Because of this very shift from anthropomorphism to a polymorphism of difference, it is too hasty, Derrida insists, to con- ceive the "becoming animal or child" from within a refutation of psychoanalysis.39 Perhaps Freud's model, he suggests, can be rethought in a way that it becomes less anthropocentric than Deleuze would have it. For Deleuze, the egological construction of the subject is nothing but a becoming trapped "in its molar form and subjectivity."40 Similarly, the direction of what Rene Major calls Der- rida's "desistantial psychoanalysis" aims against the egological con- struction of the subject: "The logic proper to desistanee leads to the destabilization of the subject, to its disidentification from every posi- tion in estance, from all determinations of the subject by the ego."41 Derrida then shares with Deleuze and Guattari a profound critique of egological reductionism in defining the human, but he differs in the role psychoanalysis plays in its valuation and critique of the ego- logical construction of the subject. This difference becomes impor- tant when we assess the self-positioning of psychoanalysis in relation to the law, the symbolic order, and the signifying regimes. In certain respects, both Derrida and Deleuze/Guattari then share the interest in a "deterritorialized" subject formed before or beyond the egological construction that requires a subjection to the symbolic order and the law. But while Deleuze and Guattari main- tain that psychoanalysis supports this subjection and promotes a pol- itics of adaptation, Derrida insists that the potential for critique in psychoanalysis - regardless of possible reductive practices in certain locales - is vaster and must be taken in its most radical implications. Derrida 's ethics of reading psychoanalysis is, in this respect, always oriented toward a "psychoanalysis to come." Such a psychoanalysis would have to insist, as both Deleuze and Derrida do, on the pro- ductive energies of the unconscious and share an ethos of perme- able boundaries and inclusion rather than exclusion in defining the human. Branka Arsic argues that Derrida comes close to Deleuze when Derrida develops a notion of "the self that exists as the priva- tion of selfhood," a notion that can be approximated to Deleuze 's presignifying semiotic and the passive syntheses of impersonal life. We may add that it can also be approximated to the post-Freudian42 turn in psychoanalysis to more fluid epistemologies, a turn initiated most prominently by Melanie Klein. After the Kleinian turn, psy- choanalysis begins to draw on earlier and earlier modes of being marked by the emergence of early fantasy life before the constitu- tion of the subject and of personhood. In a sense, this mode of being is also linked to Derrida 's concern with freedom, responsibility, and</page><page sequence="11">236 Gabriele Schwab sovereignty because it is a mode of being that unfolds in a transi- tional space between impersonal and bare life. But, above all, it is a mode of being that resists the egological definitions and secondary revisions of a subject interpellated to live according to historical time and the order of the law.43 If Derrida asks at the end of "Freud and the Scene of Writing" how writing can be put into communication with cultural iconotropes such as the parched woman drinking the inky dust of the law or the son of man who fills his entrails with sweet-tasting scrolls of law, he calls for a writing that is not confined by the ego- logical structure of consciousness. Derrida speaks of a "new psycho- analytic graphology" whose direction is suggested by the genealogy of morals implied in Melanie Klein's analysis of good and bad inter- nal objects. According to Derrida, this genealogy begins to illumi- nate the entire problem of the archi-trace.44 If these internal objects of infantile fantasies leave their traces in the valuation (or devalua- tion) of writing as sweet nourishment or as excrement, then writing cannot be contained by the inky dust or honey-sweet scrolls of the law that governs the symbolic order. Rather, Derrida suggests, "the logical and ideal structure of conscious speech must . . . submit to the dream system."45 And if the dream is an original form of writing that puts words on stage without becoming subservient to them, then the signifiers of unconscious experience will continue to mark writing.46 Writing, in other words, bears the trace of psychical writing and this trace may overwrite the inky dust or honey-flavored scrolls of law. Psychical writing, in turn, is composed of the signifiers of uncon- scious experience, and the latter bear the imprint of the other, including the inscriptions of the history of lost objects. The latter provides the crucial link between writing and mourning or, as Der- rida puts it in the epigraph that I used to open this essay, to death as the trace and supplement of speech. Again, Melanie Klein may pro- vide a crucial concept to supplement Derrida's concern with a "psy- choanalytic graphology" that exceeds the egological construction of the I. Klein distinguishes between a paranoid-schizoid position, on the one hand, in which the world is divided into good and bad objects and the infant/subject is haunted by persecutory fantasies that figure the Other as threatening and intrusive and, on the other hand, a depressive position in which the infant becomes capable of mourning and sustaining ambivalence. The painful and disturbing recognition that good and bad may inhere in the same object requires the ability not only to sustain ambivalence but also to mourn the loss of the exclusively good object and to face the pain of</page><page sequence="12">Derrida , The Parched Woman, and the Son of Man 237 mourning. Klein's theory of the paranoid-schizoid and the depres- sive position already contains a rudimentary ethics of otherness. Derrida expands this ethics by including Abraham and Torok's the- ory of incorporation. In psychic life, it makes all the difference, they insist, whether mourning takes the form of acknowledging or of denying the death or loss of the Other. This perspective endows mourning with an ethical imperative. Acknowledging the loss and facing the pain is both a psychological and an ethical challenge, and, when Derrida says that death shapes the interior of speech as sup- plement, he traces the manifestations of loss, death, and mourning into the interior of speech. In this notion of speech, the traces of mourning may manifest themselves as the very force that challenges the rigidity of the law where it hardens into paranoid-schizoid divi- sions between good and bad objects, human and nonhuman, human and animal, or life and death. Mourning would be the con- dition for bearing the uncertainties, complexities, and ambiguities or ambivalences of fluid epistemologies or of the formation of a self that encompasses more than an egological structure. In this sense, mourning would be the affective underpinning of a speech that har- bors death as a trace and supplement. We can see now the link of writing to memory and mourning so crucial in Derrida's work. Derrida's inclusive concept of writing strives toward and supports the task of introjection as part of writ- ing's memory work. His notion of writing and the trace acknowl- edges its debt to Abraham and Torok's distinction between introjection and incorporation. Marked by a refusal to mourn, incor- poration creates a cryptic enclave within language, an enclave that is reminiscent of, while at the same time concealing, the psychic tomb that holds the other captive like a living dead.47 Introjection, by con- trast, emerges from a process of mourning in which the other is released while his or her (or its) memory traces are introjected and thereby enlarge the self.48 This is why Derrida insists that "writing is not essentially verbal or phonetic,"49 but needs to be understood from within the "dynamism of an intersubjective functioning"50 and - we could add - a dynamism in which death shapes the interior of speech as its trace.51 I want to add a set of questions to these reflections on writing and mourning: How do we relate to writing itself as Other? How do we introject writing as an object of (libidinal) cathexis and thus use writing to enlarge the self? And how do we remain mindful that there is a remainder of irreducible otherness that "always extends out on the other side beyond the self?52 To the extent that we man- age to refrain from effacing this otherness - be it by projective</page><page sequence="13">238 Gabriele Schxvab identification or incorporation - we will feel, on the tip of our tongue, not the inky dust or the sweet taste of the scrolls of law but, as Derrida says at the end of Fors , "the angular cut of a shattered word."53 This is when we begin our work of mourning on the other scene of writing. Let me end with a poem that reflects death as shaping the inte- rior of poetic utterance. The poem performs an encounter between Jacques Derrida and Samuel Beckett, two of the greatest writers of our time who continue profoundly to shape contemporary philo- sophical thought and its awareness of death as the trace and sup- plement of speech. We could almost think of this poem as performing an act of mourning in which Derrida and Beckett become an interior and exterior difference to each other in their bifurcating ways of having always already faced and lived death at the interior of speech.

Derrida 's reading may surprise since Deleuze and Guattari do not in general align themselves to the human-animal distinction. Especially in their concept of "becoming-animal," they refute the "irre- ducibility of the human order" as based on a false culturalism and moralism. Espe- cially states of molecular becomings produce a zone of indétermination in which the boundary between the human and the animal becomes uncertain (see Deleuze and Guattari, Thousand Plateaus, 273). 30 Cf.
