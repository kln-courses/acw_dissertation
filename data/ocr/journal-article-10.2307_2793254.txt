<plain_text><page sequence="1">Indian Textiles from Guatemala and Mexico. By Miss Laura E. Start, M.Ed. Summary of a communication to the 78 Institute, I6 March, I948 The great variety of effects in weaving that can be pro- duced on a primitive stick loom of the back-strap type, a form traceable to Maya times, is well exemplified in the McDougall collection recently given to the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford. The weaver's equipment consists of a bundle of sticks of dif- ferent dimensions, weights and sections with sufficient rope (made of agave fibre) to suspend one end bar from a tree or hook and attach the back strap of leather, cloth or plaited palm leaf to the other end bar. After selecting her end bars the weaver may choose a thin stick to hold the heddle loops, a thicker, heavier one as shed rod, to open the countershed, and thin ones for laze rods to keep the even and uneven warps separate, another to act as spool and, most preciQus of all, a smooth, hard-wood batten or sword-stick with some type of bevelled edge. The last is made by the men. Cotton, wool and maguey or ixtil (agave fibre) can be used as yarn, but for all traditional garments such as the huipil, tzute and quexquemitl cotton is always chosen. Wool is used for men's jackets, shawls or pouches and for ceremonial trousers, as well as for some of the wider decorated belts worn chiefly by women. The climate being temperate and equable, men usually wear cotton trousers and a shirt cut on rectangular lines, with the jacket or shawl as an additional garment; and they always wear some head-covering, either a hat or a tzute. The lengths of cloth for the women's wrap-round skirts are almost invariably woven by men on a two- or four-treadle loom, of the old English or European type, and are traded in the local markets. These skirt lengths may be decorated by coloured weft stripes or by ikat-patterned stripes in either warp or weft. Ikat patterns (the name is Indonesian) are produced by a resist method; the pattern which is to remain as a light-coloured design on a darker ground is tightly tied up with string or fibre that will be impervious to the dye and the cloth is dyed before being woven. In the remote highland communities the cotton is gathered, cleaned, beaten into a long sliver, spun and, if needed for pattern work, dyed by the weaver herself; but nearer the towns commercially spun yarn is being more and more used. Much time and highly skilled labour are expended on such a garment as the huipil, a rectangular blouse-like article made from two or three lengths of cloth woven to the exact size required. Beside various fancy weaves, such as canvas, repp, crepe, corded and gauze, garments are further decorated by brocading in cotton, wool or silk, floating warps and weft patterns, applique and embroidery. In Mexican Indian work the use of fancy gauze weaves is highly developed. On a lacy background of so-called Peruvian gauze (a weave found in ancient Peruvian examples), anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and geometrical patterns appear as solid, being worked in another closely packed type of gauze weave. The elaborate crossings, of the warps used in the fancy gauzes are usually done entirely by the fingers, and the woman visualizes her patterns, having no drawn design. Plain gauze weaving is sometimes expedited by the use of an extra heddle to pull the necessary warps across their neighbours before a shed is made. In the Mexican area, too, double-cloth weaving with reversible patterns in colour is used for making belts and bags. Again fingers do most of the work, but the weaving is aided by the use of three heddles and a shed stick, so that if the pattern is red on white, the shed stick and heddle nearest to it operate the odd and even white warps and the second and third heddles the red warps, so helping the woman to make her selection. In Guatemala eighty per cent. of the inhabitants are of Indian blood and most of them claim direct descent from the Maya. The patterns worked into the garments are traditional and charac- teristic in each tribe. Where not derived from geometrical forms (possibly suggested by the marvellous architectural remains of the past), the motives seem mainly to have some connexion with the daily life of the people. A huipil made by a Pocoman Indian from San Juan Sacatepequex has brocaded patterns of stags, sheep, armadillo and turkeys, all good for food, horses and mules, useful for going to the local market, and crested birds. Often a weaver will introduce some small special motive, her signature, which will be recognized by other women of her tribe wherever the garment may be. A necklace and pendant effect worked in applique, which appears on garments from several tribes, may be derived from the necklace and pendant worn by the Maize God of Maya mythology, whilst anti-spirals connected with conventional feather patterns, which occur on several specimens, may indicate their 67</page><page sequence="2">Nos. 78, 79 Man JUNE, I948 feathered-serpent symbol. A highly conventionalized double eagle is probably reminiscent of the Spanish conquest in I 52I, as it is an emblem of Charles V. Pattems in the Mexican section are more sophisticated and, particularly the embroidered ones, savour of Western civilization. This may be due to Spanish influence, but commercial patterns are also available in the markets and are adapted. An eight-pointed star and a large hand which appear on several examples may have special significance, whilst in both countries a bird on a tree is used as a motive (said to represent the tree of life and to be connected with fertility rites): the tree is usually considered to be a pine and was the symbol of the Maya race or the place they came from. Further study of a larger group of pattems niight reveal the origins of other designs, but the rapid spread of commercialism and easier contact with the outside world is resulting in the adoption of Western types of garment and a deterioration of both craftsmanship and ornament. For this reason a collection such as this is a permanent and irreplaceable record of the great technical skill and artistic quality displayed in the weaving of these Indian peoples.</page></plain_text>
