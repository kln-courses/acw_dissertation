<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHIVES OF ARCHAEOLOGY, Nos. 12-20, edited by David A. Baerreis and others. The Society for American Archaeology and the University of Wisconsin Press, 1961-63. On Microcards. During the past two years Archives of Archaeology has made available in microcard form nine additional titles of considerable value. These continue the series initiated in 1959, the first eleven of which were dis- cussed in this journal by Richard B. Woodbury (AJA 65:3 [196i] 332-334). Woodbury considered fully the process of microcard reproduction, which was then new and comparatively untried, and appraised its ad- vantages and limitations. Since then the profession has become more familiar with the medium and many libraries are now equipped with the requisite mechan- isms for easy reading of the cards. It is hardly neces- sary, therefore, to discuss further their mechanics and characteristics. The reader who has not already made his own estimate through direct experience is referred for indoctrination to Woodbury's review. The titles here considered cover a wide range of sub- ject matter but may be classified broadly into a few groups on the basis of their general character and pur- pose. Numbers 13 and 18 ("Documentation for Pre- historic Investigations in the Upper Little Colorado Drainage, Eastern Arizona," by John B. Rinaldo, Wil- liam A. Longacre, Leslie G. Freeman, Jr., and Paul</page><page sequence="2">1964] BOOK REVIEWS 91 S. Martin; and "Pottery and Artifact Provenience Data from Sites in the Painted Rocks Reservoir, Western Arizona," by Alfred E. Johnson and William W. Was- ley) are supplementary to other reports already pub- lished in letterpress form by the same authors. The microcards supply the minutely detailed statistical data that were used in the preparation of the reports, in- cluding measurements and provenience of individual artifacts and structures, distributions of sherd types, and the like. For most readers these data have rela- tively little interest, and to publish them in extenso would be costly and cumbersome. To a few specialists, however, they can be of great value, and are now made available at slight cost. The three cards com- prising Number 13 provide data relative to the ex- cavation of eight Pueblo villages and a survey of 170 sites in the vicinity of Vernon, Arizona. This includes 33 pages of statistics on 20o classes of artifacts and 57 pages of sherd data and analyses. Number 18 provides on two cards 54 pages of similar data on nine sites near Gila Bend, Arizona. Numbers 14 and 17 ("Archaeological Investigations near Mobridge, South Dakota," by David A. Baerreis and John E. Dallman; and "Petroglyphs of the Upper Ohio Valley, I," by James L. Swauger) present full reports of archaeological field work not otherwise pub- lished, including text, maps, photographs, statistical data, and bibliography. The report by Baerreis et al. covers the salvage excavation of four sites along the Missouri River in South Dakota, in areas to be flooded by impounded waters. These were prehistoric villages that were also occupied into contact times, and are thought tentatively by the authors to have been Ari- kara. The main emphasis was to focus on patterns of change within specific sites and to provide detailed presentation of the material for use in comparative stud- ies. Houses were in circular pits, 1/2 to 5 feet deep and up to 30 feet in diameter, with long entryways, central firepits, and many cache cists and roof-posts. Very full descriptions of artifacts are provided, with excellent drawings. The paper is admirable in method, clarity, and completeness. Number 17, by Swauger, is a lucid description of six major petroglyph sites in the Upper Ohio Valley, well illustrated with drawings and photographs, and with a critical bibliography. These sites consist of large horizontal sandstone blocks on which rather crude zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, and geometric designs have been incised. Number i6 ("Preceramic Japan: Source Materials," by Harumi Befu and Chester S. Chard) presents on nine cards the full English translations of fifteen Japa- nese reports published since i955 and used by the au- thors in their article "Preceramic Japan" (American Anthropologist 62:5, 815-849), with some amendments to that paper. Thus made available to English readers is much otherwise unusable material. Numbers i2 and i5 differ somewhat in nature and purpose from the other items presented. Both are full reproductions of doctoral theses never heretofore pub- lished, and they are exemplars of one of the impres- sive potentials of the microcard method. Every scholar knows that much valuable material is effectually buried in unpublished theses that are only theoretically avail- able from their library oubliettes, many of them de- serving of wider distribution. Two such are presented here. Number 12 ("The Chronological Significance of Maya Ceramics") by George Vaillant was a pioneer effort thirty-five years ago and remains today a minor classic. It can now be read by many who have hereto- fore known of it only by hearsay. Vaillant defined six periods in Maya ceramics, in a chronology based on a closely reasoned analysis of relationships in an area where vertical stratigraphy was minimal. There is a helpful foreword by James C. Gifford. The synthesis of Kamchadal culture by Chard (Number 15, "Kamchadal Culture and its Relationships in the Old and New Worlds") is different in its ap- peal, but its very lucid and literate reconstruction of an extinct culture in remote Kamchatka that may have been more closely related to the prehistory of Alaska than has been fully appreciated, makes a considerable contribution. The author's procedure is interesting, in that he has sought to reconstruct from meager sources, documentary and archaeological, and mostly Russian, an extinct culture, and then to compare its essential traits with those of adjacent peoples. He manages to do this objectively in considerable detail and analyzes the culture in terms of its material, social, and "intel- lectual" factors. In his conclusions Chard sees the Kamchadal as deriving from an ancient sedentary coastal population of Eskimo affiliations, from Kam- chatka to Bering Strait and thence to the Northwest Coast. The story is fascinating and colorful in its own right, and makes excellent reading even for the non- specialist. Number i9 ("Cachimbos de Alagoinhas," by Thales de Azevedo and Maria David de Azevedo) is a useful paper in Portuguese on pottery pipes in the state of Bahia, Brazil, read at a conference of folklorists in 1957 but not elsewhere published. By far the most monumental item in the current list is Number 20 ("Iowa Archaeological Reports, 1934 to 1939," by Ellison Orr, with an Evaluation and In- dex by Marshall McKusick). This is nothing less than the full reproduction on thirty-five cards of ten vol- umes of typescript (ca. 1700 pages) comprising the field reports of Mr. Orr on archaeological work done for WPA in Iowa and Minnesota between 1934 and 1939, as well as his own numerous personal investiga- tions. That Mr. Orr was one of the giants of archaeol- ogy of whom legends are made is apparent from the outline of his life and the evaluation of his work by McKusick. He was a teacher, a business man, and a self-taught "amateur" in many fields of natural history and anthropology, who devoted full time to archaeol- ogy after his "retirement" at 73. For six years, between the ages of 77 and 82, he was field supervisor of WPA summer crews, writing up his notes during the inter- vening winters. He died in 1950, at 93- The only copy of his manuscript is deposited at Ef-</page><page sequence="3">92 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 68 figy Mounds National Monument, Iowa, and the pres- ent microcard reproduction thus makes readily avail- able for the first time a vast resource of archaeological matter that will probably never be otherwise published and could not possibly be duplicated by additional field work. Six volumes include detailed and carefully record- ed data on hundreds of sites (mostly mounds) in east- ern Iowa, and the results of surveys of many other sites not excavated, all copiously illustrated with maps, drawings, and photographs. The other volumes contain a compendium of "sundry papers" on a wide range of archaeological topics, including, e.g., earth lodges, ele- phant remains, the occurrence and uses of catlinite, and an appealing story of the devoted excavations by two elderly "boys" at a state institution farm. Mr. Orr had a keen eye, a sound scientific sense, a delightful narrative style, and inexhaustible vigor. His work is essential to any thorough understanding of Iowa pre- history. In general, the technical excellence of these micro- cards is high. Most of the typescript is easily readable and line drawings are clear. Photographs, however, are often obscure; in many cases they are mere blobs and of no use whatever. It is apparent that the method can effectively deal with photographs only if the origi- nals are of unusual sharpness and high contrast. Two suggestions are proffered for improvement in future issues: I) that tables of contents be reproduced on separate cards at a scale sufficiently large for unas- sisted reading, so that reference to particular parts of the text may be facilitated; and 2) that every effort be made to reproduce illustrations and tables immedi- ately next to those pages of text to which they pertain. One of the more serious limitations of the method inheres in the difficulty of cross-reference from page to page, as well as from microcard to other relevant matter, and any device in alleviation thereof will great- ly enhance the usefulness of the cards. It suffices to note further only that the method has by this time fully proved itself by its contribution to the store of usable materials available at modest cost to the general reader.
