<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bergson, Instinct, and Frost's "The White-Tailed Hornet" B. J. SOKOL Goldsmiths' College, University of London Tr has been long alleged that Robert Frost's poetry manifests an unsystematic skepticism, and this has been condemned some- times as indicative of his spiritual vagrancy. Perhaps to answer charges that Frost was a mere spiritual drifter, several critics have argued that there is a firm basis of belief behind his poetry, and a number have linked his beliefs with the vitalist philosophy of Henri Bergson.! In a 1941 conversation with Lawrance Thompson, Frost sug- gested himself as a Bergsonian by claiming that he had been, back in I9I I, a champion of Bergson's newly translated Creative Evolution against hidebound American bigotry. But Frost's story was embellished with the fantastic and gleefully racy particu- lars that typically betray his tendency to fabulation. So it should have been accompanied with a warning when it was retold in Thompson's official biography.2 However, rather than question it, Thompson readily accepted Frost's claim of adherence to Bergson's new ideas and concentrated on his conflict with his opponent of I9iI, even adding imaginary details.3 Thompson's I See especially Dorothy Judd Hall, "The Height of Feeling Free: Frost and Berg- son,' Texas Quarterly, I9 (I976) I28-43, and also John F.

Here Frost's I94I account includes a claim that in I9II the elderly, dignified, and scholarly Reverend William Hayes Ward "still took his exercise 'running around Newark in his drawers.'" I discuss how Thompson similarly failed to take sufficient account of Frostian tall-tales in "What Went Wrong Between Robert Frost and Ezra Pound," New England Quarterly, 49 ( I976), 52 I-4I . 3 In Robert Frost: The Early Years, pp. 38I-82, Thompson fictionalizes: "hurt, yet frightened by the massive dignity of his distinguished host, Frost could not resist a feel- ing of indignation." Thompson then chooses to reconstruct the argument the Reverend Ward should have used to dismiss Frost's points.

The point Frost himself seems to have intended to convey however was that he was in I9I I a progressive "modern" thinker, boldly ready to oppose conservatism and staunchly pro-Bergson. But there is evidence against this in the fact that more than half of the comments written by Frost in the margins of his own I9II edition of Creative Evolution are questioning, dubi- ous, or outright critical.4 Frost's faultfinding varies from captious attacks on verbal looseness (perhaps faults of Bergson's trans- lator, Arthur Mitchell) to more pointed remarks, many of which are in a familiar Frostian way humorously oblique to Bergson's immediately expressed concerns. In general his marginalia show Frost's reaction to Bergson's system to be not convinced belief but complex and ramified doubt. I propose to consider the similar complex doubt dominating the Frost poem that most directly reflects issues discussed in Creative Evolution, "The White-Tailed Hornet."5 This poem contains several kinds of doubleness making it particularly difficult to assess. Its speaker's descriptions of the hornet are highly subjective, by turns playful, vindictive, self- mocking, parodic, and so forth. His tones are often multiple at one and the same moment, but always exclude the scientifically pique for the strong feelings suggested by Frost's account of visiting an intolerant editor is the actuality that in I9I I Frost was still a scarcely published poet. His attitude to Ward may be echoed in a remark in an unpublished letter to Alfred Harcourt dated I2 August I9I5, in the Henry Holt Archives at Princeton University Library: "If I ran away from anything when I went to England it was the American editor." Frost's uneasy experiences between i9iI and I9I5 with other editors are treated in my "The Publication of Robert Frost's First Books: Triumph and Fiasco," Book Collector, 26 (I977), 228-39. 4 Frost's annotated copy of the first American edition of Creative Evolution, trans. Arthur Mitchell (New York: Henry Holt, I9II), in the Fales Library at New York University, is described in my "Robert Frost in England," Diss. Columbia I974, pp. i6- 25. It is also partially analyzed in Ronald Bieganowski, "Sense of Time in Robert Frost's Poetics: A Particular Influence of Henri Bergson," Resources for American Literary Study, I3 (I983), I84-93. Bieganowski does not discuss the negative tenor of many of Frost's marginalia. 5 Bergson's discussions on wasps, clearly echoed in Frost's poem, are found near the midpoint of Creative Evolution. This puts to rest doubts expressed in Bieganow- ski, p. i86n., as to whether the Frost "annotations being limited to the first quarter of [Bergson's] book might represent the extent of Frost's reading of the text."</page><page sequence="3">46 American Literature neutral.6 The speaker, after expressing various bemused reactions to the hornet's angry/infallible behavior in the first verse para- graph and to its gentler/incompetent behavior in the second paragraph, becomes sententious in the last paragraph. This para- graph, mock-conclusive in tone, concerns scientific questions, the questioning of science itself, and the larger issue of man's place in the scheme of nature. Frost's poem is also difficult to assess because of its back- ground. It is among the several Frost poems showing familiarity with science and an interest in problems of the epistemology of science. Such knowledge and interest distinguish Frost from many of his contemporaries in the "modern movement," who were often remarkably medieval in their concerns. On the con- trary Frost specifically addressed and questioned contemporary science, as in his humorously doubting poem on the visual basis of Robert Millikan's measurements of single electrons ("A Wish to Comply"). In "The White-Tailed Hornet" Frost pursues a scientific controversy, distinctly echoed in Creative Evolution, concerning the nature of certain intricate instincts found among the Hymenoptera family of insects. Bergson repeatedly uses the Hymenoptera as exemplary of the culmination of a particular line of evolution. They are still placed there in the most recent scientific survey, The Hymenop- tera, where the editors Ian Gaulde and Barry Bolton also men- tion the long tradition of making comparisons, as Bergson did, between this family and man.7 Bergson particularly instances certain wasps as representative of the Hymenoptera, at the top of one of the "two divergent paths" of animal evolution, "one of which led to instinct and the other to intelligence."8 He then turns to material drawn from the pioneering work of the great 6 My reading of the varying attitudes of the poem's speaker contradicts the claim in Johannes Kj0rven, Robert Frost's Emerging Design (Atlantic Highlands, N. J.: Humanities Press, I987), pp. 7I-72, that the speaker "observes accurately and objectively from the outside." According to Kj0rven the poem criticizes an externally observing scientific atti- tude in favor of the attitude of an artistic individual, or a self. This interpretation seems to me to oversimplify the poem by falsely supposing it promotes certain pieties. 7 The Hymenoptera (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, I988), p. 6. 8 Creative Evolution trans.

Cf. my note 15.</page><page sequence="4">Frost's "The White-Tailed Hornet" 47 entomologist Jean Henri Casimir Fabre. For nearly two pages Bergson details how several species of wasps "lay their eggs in spiders, beetles or caterpillars, which, having first been subjected by the wasp to a skillful surgical operation, will go on living motionless a certain number of days, and thus provide the larvae with fresh meat" (p. i8i). Lurid details of vivisection are given, such as, "the Ammophilia Hirsuita gives nine successive strokes of its sting upon nine nerve-centers of its caterpillars, and then seizes the head and squeezes it in its mandibles, enough to cause paralysis without death" (p. I82). It is clear that Bergson greatly admires these elaborate instincts for "'paralyzing without killing"' but his reasons for doing so differ somewhat from the reasons for the equally clear admira- tion of Fabre. Fabre was impressed with what he claimed was the "infallibility," as well as precision and finesse, of instincts tuned to such specific details as the exact location of the nerves of their prey. So Fabre wrote concerning the three types of wasps and prey that Bergson later instanced: [La mere Scolie] Son invincible refus d'entamer la Cetoine autre part, dut-il perir de faim, nous montre combien est rigoureuse la regle de conduite inspiree a son instinct.9 [Le Spex et le Grillon] C'est dans ce triple coup de poignard que se montrent, dans toute leur magnificence, l'infallibilite, la science infuse de l'instinct.10 [Ammophile Herissee] La methode operatoire adoptee par l'hymen- optere en vue de paralyser le ver gris est, dans la domaine de l'instinct, la plus haute manifestation que je connaisse jusqu'ici. Quelle science infuse.... Quelle savante logique, quelle su'rete dans ce physiologiste inconscient! " Bergson's text and footnotes indicate no such belief in the in- fallible precision of the wasp's instincts. They show rather that he partly believed views specifically contrary to Fabre's found in George and Elizabeth Peckham's Wasps, Social and Solitary. This curious book is based on both close observations and frankly anthropomorphic imagining. The latter can be dismissed but the former seem to support the Peckhams' repeated conten- 9 Souvenirs Entomologiques (Paris: C.

If accepted the Peckhams' observations certainly demonstrate that unlike Fabre's European wasp species, the American Midwestern wasps Ammophilia urania are not "creatures of mere instinct."2 The observations evidence not only simple lapses of "blind, mechani- cally perfect instinct" (p. 20) but also what the Peckhams call "varieties among the different individuals in character and intel- lect" (p. 22). They even claim to have observed one very superior Ammophilia urania who used a small stone as a hammer, and thus "improvised a tool and made intelligent use of it" (pp. 39-40). And they also repeat one of Fabre's most famous experi- ments, involving removing the paralyzed prey to an "incorrect" distance from the nest-preparing female, which proved to Fabre the rigid inflexibility of wasp instincts. The Peckhams find, di- rectly on the contrary, that for their native wasp, "her intelligence led her to adapt herself to circumstances" (p. 305). Bergson rather quietly passes over these contradictions, grant- ing the Peckhams that "instinct is, like intelligence, fallible" and may show "individual deviations," but denying their "tenta- tive intelligent experiments" (p. I82). This is because Bergson wants to maintain that there is an essential difference between the instinctive knowledge created by forces of evolution and the knowledge we are familiar with created by the use of human intelligence; hence he refuses to let us compare "the Ammo- philia with the entomologist" (p. I83). In accord with Bergson's earlier scheme of distinctions an insect cannot improvise a ham- mer, or language, because only intelligence, and not instinct, may achieve "the faculty of making and using unorganized instruments" (p. 147). Yet Bergson himself earlier admits that for the sake of his evolutionary argument he may overstate the sharpness of the instinct/intelligence distinction (p. 143). Just such discussions are the subject of the meditation in "The White-Tailed Hornet," subtitled in all Frost's books from 1936 to I963: "or, The Revision of Theories." But before considering the treatment of theories in Frost's poem I must point out some strange aspects of the natural his- tory of his particular hornet. "Hornets" are in American ter- minology not the Vespa Crabro but large, frightening, and not 12 Wasps, Social and Solitary (Westminster: Arnold Constable, I905), p. I5.</page><page sequence="6">Frost's "The White-Tailed Hornet" 49 particularly fierce social wasps. According to H. E. Evans a wasp's sting is actually a "modified ovipositor and thus prevails only in females," and moreover "the males of both social and solitary wasps . . . play at most a very minor role in the nest- ing process." Defense and provision for the nest is undertaken by sterile females. Evans also gives the information that in tem- perate climates, among social species, stings can be very rarely administered by parent wasps at all because the fertile females leave the nests only once in the life cycle, just after hibernation."3 Thus it is impossible for Frost's nest-dwelling hornet to be as it is described, a stinging, protective, providing father. Another incongruity concerning Frost's hornet is that it is supposed to mistake a "little huckleberry" for a fly, but social wasps in fact frequently feed on berries. Frost also gives his male social wasp infallible and very specific instinctive nerve-stinging "knowledge," ludicrously directed at the speaker's "sneeze-nerve of a nostril." Thus the hornet closely resembles the nerve- stinging surgeon-wasps described at great length by Fabre and Bergson. But "he" cannot have been one of these surgeon-wasps because they are always the females of solitary wasp species which do not build paper nests. Such divergences between Frost's poem and fact may be sug- gesting a typical Frostian warning that we should be alert for what he calls his ulteriority. It is not certain that Frost delib- erately caused any of his poem's detailed contradictions with nature, but I think that he did. Many of his poems show he was an advanced amateur botanist and was also keenly inter- ested in insects and birds. So I suspect he may have been aware that there is indeed a white-tailed hawk native to North America and also a white-headed hornet, but no species of wasp or hornet called white-tailed." It is entirely in keeping with the Frostian sense of humor to plant deliberate linguistic confusion such as 13 Encyclopedia Americana (I977 ed.), "Wasps." Frost repeats his mistake, if it is one, about stinging wasps' genders in "Waspish," published in the same book as "The White-Tailed Hornet." 14 Webster's New International Dictionary (2nd ed.). A specialist in the Natural History Museum, London, kindly found a specimen for me of the North American Dolicho- vespula Maculata, called in Webster the white-faced hornet, with in fact off-white or ivory colored (see note I8) last abdominal segments, or tail. This large American social wasp has a range including New Hampshire, and so is very likely the species of Frost's hornet.</page><page sequence="7">50 American Literature this in a poem and then slyly to point to it. The sly pointing occurs when Frost's speaker describes the white-tailed hornet's "Hawking for flies."15 In addition to several doublings-up of fact, Frost's poem may contain also a literary allusion in the simile: The exit he comes out at like a bullet Is like the pupil of a pointed gun. The poetic equation of a gun with a dangerous look is found also in Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis (which like Frost's poem also has marvelously lively descriptions of animals): This ill presage advisedly she marketh. Even as the wind is hushed before it raineth, Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh, Or as the berry breaks before it staineth, Or like the deadly bullet of a gun, His meaning struck her ere his words begun. (Lines 457-62) Both poems have in common, as they compare guns and men- acing looks, a sense of a rapidly approaching debacle that cannot be avoided. Frost's speaker and Shakespeare's Venus both know they cannot fend off by means of any words the anger they have themselves provoked. Both are also physically larger and supposedly higher on the scale of being than their unintended adversaries, and in comic ways both are actually bowled over. Frost makes the most of this by having his speaker exagger- ate the farcical physical consequences of having no appropriate verbal response to an insect: He rolled me off the field head over heels And would not listen to my explanations. Here the angry hornet's instinct and "insect certainty" defend his nest and territory in the woodshed, failing to distinguish the typical man who would smoke him out from the "exception" whose motives are not hostile. The hornet is programmed to simple responses, perhaps to be compared with those of an insen- 15 This detail must also be contrary to fact, for the specialist at the Natural History Museum told me social wasps would not hunt flies in this way. I think the blurring of the distinction of social and solitary wasps must have an ulterior purpose. I am grate- ful to a referee for suggesting this may be "that classification, that taxonomy determine interpretations (as the poem's title also suggests)."</page><page sequence="8">Frost's "The White-Tailed Hornet" 5' sitive critic. His simple wrath wins the moment, just as Shake- speare's outraged Adonis overmasters the superior experience, finesse, and indeed much larger size of Shakespeare's Venus. In defense against intrusion lesser beings achieve absurd triumphs over man and goddess. The next paragraph of Frost's poem presents the hornet as more pacific when away from his nest's territory. He is even seemingly more understanding. He pursues flies to feed his young in a businesslike way and is able "not to put you in the wrong" if you are an unoffending human, even when he lands on you. "Here" Frost says the hornet "is at his best," but adds, "but even here-." This is near the midpoint of the poem. Just after the dash sig- nifying hesitation and doubt follows an account of the hornet's ineffectual attacks on nailheads and on a huckleberry, despite the verbal warnings, "Those are fastened down.... Wrong shape, wrong color, and wrong scent." The speaker's attempted expla- nations fail again, but this time a soft "little huckleberry" bowls the frightening hornet over, not the hornet his human victim. Next the clumsily hunting hornet misses catching an actual fly, which escapes with derision. The vigor with which the speaker describes the hornet's errors implies some degree of vindictive relishing of seeing his vanquisher vanquished. But the hornet's behavior also raises some doubts in the speaker, such as whether his errors are due to blind, rigid, species instincts mistaking means and ends, as in Fabre's experiments, or to an individual's faulty use of instincts, as in the Peckhams' observations. Frost's speaker first exaggerates the Peckhams' views of insect individuality. He states that he "might have" entertained belief that the insect in effect possessed language as well as thought and even sought for originality of expression: But for the fly he might have made me think He had been at his poetry, comparing Nailhead with fly and fly with huckleberry: How like a fly, how very like a fly. But the real fly he missed would never do; The missed fly made me dangerously skeptic. The wild anthropomorphism in this mock "explanation" sug- gests a possible satire. The potential for satire is of course only</page><page sequence="9">52 American Literature heightened by the explanation's reductio ad absurdum in the dry remark that it is solely because the hornet misses a "real fly" that there is room for skepticism concerning the equation of poet and Hymenoptera. The satire may be on the crude behaviorism which makes reductive equivalences. The philosopher Hilary Putnam has re- cently discussed why an ant who traces a shape having a mean- ing recognizable to human observers cannot be said to convey meaning, for it cannot be said to refer to the thing seen to be "meant." 16 Likewise the hornet making metaphors recognizable to the observer cannot be said to express or communicate poetic meaning. A darker facetiousness is also possible in the speaker's "explanation." There may be some sardonic comment implied in the equation of making poetry with the hornet's failure to obtain necessary food: this may illustrate through an Aesopian fable how ridiculously ineffectual in terms of Darwinian survival are the gifts of human poets. Such a fable would also echo the work/play antinomy that haunts much of Frost's poetry, usually reflecting some degree of guilt or doubt about the value of a poet's career. The third paragraph of the poem leaves an open question as to whether in making "downward comparisons" with ani- mals humans give due credit to themselves. I say the question is left open despite the paragraph's rhetoric of assertion because its irregular blank verse is full of rather awkward repetitions. These repeated goings over the same words seem to me to imply uncertainty, just as does the last word of the last line, "doubtful." This doubt has a metaphysical basis going beyond the impli- cation of the subtitle which the poem had only when it appeared originally in the Yale Review: "or, Doubts About an Instinct." Beyond questions of science, the divine is implicit in Frost's wit- tily converted aphorism, "To err is human, not to, animal / Or so we pay the compliment to instinct." Soon after gods are referred to explicitly: As long on earth As our comparisons were stoutly upward With gods and angels, we were men at least, But little lower than the gods and angels. 16 Reason, Truth, and History (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, I98I), pp. I-2, sets up the problem which the whole book addresses.</page><page sequence="10">Frost's "The White-Tailed Hornet" 53 Yet the gods include the sometimes destructive Venus, as we have seen. It may be apt now to recall that some of the most striking imagery concerning the hornet in the earlier parts of the poem relates to his nest and young. The nest is oddly unnamed as such but is equated in metaphors with "a balloon / That floats against the ceiling" or "a Japanese crepe-paper globe." On the contrary the hornet's hungry young are described directly, un- palatably, as "thumping grubs as big as he is." Either way, poetic or blunt, Frost reminds us of the reproductive and assimilative faculties and functions we must share with the hornet, despite all theory. An enigma concerning these faculties is expressed in a note Frost made in the margin of his own copy of Creative Evolution. This note is beside the passage (p. 26, I9II American ed.) in which Bergson claims that the sexual elements of all creatures are embryologically derived from primitive undifferentiated tis- sues, "whose cells are made of unmodified protoplasm." Frost's handwritten comment on this is striking: "Life dives under." His verb "dives" suggests the opposite of the upward-surging, complexity-seeking tendencies of life usually seen in Bergson's vitalism."7 Reflections concerning the diving-under of life may explain why Frost mythologised particularly a white-tailed hornet. The named whiteness draws attention to the tail, site of the com- bined sting and egg-depositing organ. Such organs are used by hunting wasps to sting very specific nerves with what Frost calls in his poem "certainty." The purpose is not to make a country fellow sneeze but rather to paralyze and to deposit eggs in cer- tain living creatures. These helpless creatures are then buried alive until they are eaten hollow by the hatching wasp larvae inside them. This appalling cruelty must occur or else the wasp species will not survive, although of course there is no reason to suppose personal anger in the wasp's attack on the victim. Frost, having read descriptions of such activities in Bergson, alludes to them seemingly jovially by describing an unfortunate 17 Frost observes in another marginal note to his own copy of Bergson, p. 66, that evolution sometimes fails and must take a step backward. He comments on the persis- tence of "lower" species: the "kind from which they vary is a base to fall back on in case they fail." However "Life dives under" suggests a force serving purposes more intrinsic than mere security.</page><page sequence="11">54 American Literature personal misunderstanding leading to the hornet's anger and to an attack causing a sneeze. But I do not believe Frost means us to find him cute, glossing, or naive. Rather I think his poem's palpable tone of fabulation asks us to check up on him and discover how he dissembles horror in seeming lightness. Often in Frost there is more lurking in a light tone than a joke. Also as often, there are clues to an ulterior significance in the poem's title. This title names the color white, which in several of Frost's poems is emblematic of a feared utter lack of divine caring or moral meaning in life. For instance in the same book as "The White-Tailed Hornet" Frost published the bale- fully Darwinian poem "Design," originally titled "In White." In this sonnet the whiteness in the pattern of a flower, predatory spider, and moth is felt to be appalling because it implies blank- ness and silence where a design concerned with meaning and kindness is sought. The color white is used in the same em- blematic way in the winter poem "Stars," published in A Boy's Will (1913). There white stars are hoped to be celestial over- lookers but are feared to be indifferent; they are equated with the snow-white eyes of the Roman goddess of wisdom but then the goddess is imaged as a blind statue and mere artifact.18 The implication of the hornet's behavior and symbolic color, that there may be no divine order, no real scale of value, tends to undercut the pro-humanism and the attack on contrary pro- primitivism in the final paragraph of "The White-Tailed Hor- net." The last paragraph's assertions are certainly undercut by its awkwardness of diction, as for example in: Won't this whole instinct matter bear revision? Won't almost any theory bear revision? I believe that the identical rhyme here is made deliberately grace- less so that these rhetorical questions prepare the way for partial self-parody in the sententious answers that follow. The self-parody in the poem's supposed conclusions is also revealed by the flaws of their expression. Thus there is to a degree Frost would never accept in other writers both ab- 18 Like Minerva in this poem, Frost himself was partly "Without the gift of sight," for, I was kindly told by Kathleen Morrison, he was medically diagnosed to be nearly entirely without color vision. The artistic potency of black and white is exploited in the woodcut art Frost collected, and in his poems.</page><page sequence="12">Frost's "The White-Tailed Hornet" 55 surdity and triteness in "our images / Reflected in the mud and even dust" and bathos in "We were lost piecemeal to the ani- mals, / Like people thrown out to delay the wolves." But because the speaker's final excesses of diction dramatically express the anxiety of doubts lying behind certainties, they need no excusing. Frost's ulteriority in "The White-Tailed Hornet" is therefore not to dress piety, as Thompson among others would have it, with Science. It is rather to acknowledge the fallibility of both kinds of system when confronting inner and outer nature.</page></plain_text>
