<plain_text><page sequence="1">Speaking of Beasts: the Stoics and Plutarch on Animal Reason and the Modern Case against Animals Stephen T. Newmyer Since antiquity, a sharp dichotomy between animalkind and hu mankind has been posited by those who, for one reason or another, are eager to claim a unique and privileged position for humanity in the spectrum of creation. In the context of the debate that currently rages on the question of whether animals, because of some intrinsic qualities which they possess, can be said to have "rights" and therefore have moral claims on human beings, those ethologists x and philosophers sympathetic to the concept of animal rights note with frustration that each time it is proven that animals possess a capacity previously thought to be the exclusive province of human beings, those scientists and philosophers who see a dichotomy between humankind and the "lower animals" are quick to claim that the newly-proven animal ca pacity is not so impressive after all. The boundary between the species is then redrawn and the opponents of animal rights set up more hur dles for animals on their path toward moral consideration. The point at issue in this debate, that of the possible mental continuity between humans and other animals, is a matter of utmost importance to theo rists on both sides of the controversy, for if it could be proven that ani mals do not differ from human beings in any morally significant as 1 Ethology is the study of animal behavior in nature as opposed to the observation of animal behavior in the context of controlled laboratory experiments. On the develop ment of the term and its early history and exponents, see F. de Waal, Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals, Cambridge Ma. 1996, pp. 34-39 and p. 222 n. 30. Cognitive ethologist R. Griffin, Animal Minds, Chicago 1992, pp. 4-7, offers an enlightening discussion of the difficulties that ethologists have encountered in recent decades in arguing for the idea that non-human animals have conscious mental experiences. Philosopher D. De Grazia, Taking Animals Seriously: Mental Life and Moral Status, Cambridge 1996, p. 85, defines cognitive ethology as that branch of the science which seeks to determine the cognitive states and processes which animals may possess, including beliefs, desires, and such affective states as fear, pain and distress.</page><page sequence="2">100 S. T. Newmyer pects, humans could not justify withholding rights from animals which they accord to other humans without question. The debate over tool use by animals is typical of this controversy. It had long been maintained by some scientists and philosophers that only humans can use tools, but once it was proven by ethologists that chimpanzees, for example, crack nuts with stones and extract termites from trees with twigs, these scientists and philosophers countered that only humans can make tools 2. Perhaps no human capacity has been so jealously defended as unique to humans as has language possession. Psychologist Joseph Mortenson, in his study of animal thought, remarks justly: There is a spiritual chasm between those people who regard mankind as superior and unique and those who think that we are merely one of many animals. Those who believe that they sit beneath the crown of nature have often cited a list of distinctive human traits that elevate us above our animal brethren?man is the tool-user, the toolmaker, the builder, or the transmitter of cultural traditions. But language is the most highly regarded human trait. Man is the speaker, the listener, the reader, the symbol-user3. Even this last holdout of human uniqueness has been challenged. Research beginning in the 1970's proved conclusively that chim panzees can master and manipulate such systems as American Sign Language. The linguistic attainments of such chimpanzees as Nim Chimsky and Washoe and of such gorillas as Koko have become fa mous in popular culture 4. Not unexpectedly, scientists and philoso phers who based their case against animal rights on the supposed ex clusivity of language as a human possession next demanded that ani mals be able to show evidence of sophisticated manipulation of such aspects of language as syntax, conditionality and tense in languages more highly inflected than the English used in American Sign Lan 2 On tool use and making by chimpanzees and other animals, see Griffin, op. cit. pp. 101-114; de Waal, op. cit. pp. 72-73; and, most recently, R.

The entire question of what language is was reopened by those opposed to granting moral status to animals, in such a way as to ensure that, whatever it in fact is, animals other than humans do not possess it 5. Like their similarly-minded modern counterparts whose argu ments are outlined above, some ancient philosophers eager to main tain that the boundary between animalkind and humankind is fixed and unbridgeable posited the capacity for language as evidence that animals could never cross that boundary. The question of the linguis tic capacity of animals formed part of the larger issue which lay at the center of the ancient debate on the nature of animals. In his recent study of ancient attitudes toward animal mentation, philosopher Richard Sorabji has argued convincingly that at the heart of the an cient case against animals was the denial, on the part of some philo sophical schools, that animals possess a capacity for reason, a position which, as Sorabji demonstrates, became widely accepted in post-clas sical philosophical schools, with devastating consequences for animals that last into the present day 6. Language was viewed by some ancient philosophers as an external manifestation of the rational faculty. While it is well known that the ancients were fascinated and amused 5 A typical expression of this line of argument is that of ethical philosopher R.G. Frey, whose view of animal language is heavily influenced by the work on linguist Noam Chomsky; see Frey, The Case Against Animals, Oxford 1980, p. 93, "The answer to the question of whether Washoe is possessed of language depends upon what one takes the criterion of the possession of language to be, and philosophers and linguists often disa gree on this among themselves; but to anyone who has been influenced by the work of Chomsky, it must be doubtful that Washoe is possessed of language, except in the most attenuated sense. For the integrated whole of Chomsky's corpus. . . supports a view of language as something entirely apart and distinct from animal behavior". Along the same lines, philosopher P. Carruthers, The Animals Issue: Moral Theory in Practice, Cambridge 1992, pp. 140-142, argues that animals, even the most linguistically sophi sticated, do not seem to use language to plan, to express beliefs, or show any evidence of rational agency which is characteristic of human language. He considers existing ac counts of animal language to be largely anecdotal. 6 R. Sorabji, Animal Minds and Human Morals: The Origins of the Western De bate, Ithaca N.Y. 1993, p. 2, "Unfortunately, the Stoic view of animals, with its stress on their irrationality, became imbedded in Western, Latin-speaking Christianity above all through Augustine. Western Christianity concentrated on one half, the anti-animal half, of the much more balanced debate". Sorabji, pp. 195-205, demonstrates how this Stoic tradition was kept alive in Christian thought from Augustine through St. Thomas Aquinas, and climaxed in Descartes' famous assertion that animals have no mentality at all, being merely moving machines. On Descartes, D. A. Dombrowski, The Philosophy of Vegetarianism, Amherst Ma. 1984, makes the interesting observation, p. 12, "As with St. Thomas, Descartes does not argue that animals lack reason; with the weight of spe ciesist thought behind him, no argument is thought to be needed".</page><page sequence="4">102 S. T. Newmver by "talking animals", as can be seen, for example, in such poems as Ovid's Amores 2, 6 and Statius' Silvae 2, 4, both of which lament the passing of loquacious parrots, some ancient thinkers looked much more closely into the issue of the linguistic capacities of animals than is observable in such poems. The present study examines the Stoic case against animal rationality and its manifestation in language, and shows how that case was refuted in the animal-related treatises of Plutarch. It argues as well that the debate which Plutarch waged against the Stoics is carried on today, in remarkably similar terms. In Stoic doctrine, the lack of language possession in animals was grounded in the belief in the imperfection of the animal soul (ipu/r]). Although Greek philosophical schools seldom denied that animals possess a soul 7, they differed markedly on what constituted the ani mal soul, and the question of the presence or absence of a rational ele ment in the animal soul was a matter of fundamental importance. Even the Stoics did not deny a soul to animals, as is evident in the fragments of Chrysippus, the most vocal opponent of the idea of ani mal rationality among the Stoics 8, but they maintained that the ani mal soul could never attain to the perfection of the human soul. Aetius quotes Chrysippus as arguing that the soul is constituted of eight parts, the first seven of which make up the irrational parts of the soul: the five senses, the capacity for utterance, and the capacity for repro duction. To these is added a mysterious eighth part which the Stoics called the f|Ye?iovix?v, or "governing principle" 9. At birth, human beings possess a soul not unlike that of animals, but in humans, the ?|Y?|iovix?v develops in time into the faculty of reason (X,?yoc). Unfor tunately for animals, their irrational riyepxrvixov suffices only to allow them to exhibit such behaviors as might be classified as impulses, in cluding the tendency of animals to move toward food sources when they are identified. Animals never rise above this level, so that animal behavior appears to humans to be largely a matter of self-interest as animals seek what is useful and shun what is harmful10. Sorabji, op. cit. p. 100, "The denial of soul was not... extended to animals, even if Porphyry's successors Iamblichus and Proclus took a few first steps in this direction". 8 Chrysippus' pronouncements on the nature of animals are assembled in SVFII, pp. 205-210, for. 714-737. 9 Aetius, Placita 4, 21 (= SVF II, p. 226, fr. 827) O?

"inner reason, thought", exercises control over and ultimately gives expression to Xoyo? JtQoqpoQixo? "vocalized reason, meaningful speech". The capacity for meaningful speech arises in the r|yeuovix?v, but because of its imperfection in animals, meaningful speech is de nied to them since animal utterances do not arise from rationality. The Stoic position on animal utterances was defended in Philo's treatise De animalibus, wherein he argued that the sounds which animals utter have no more meaning than do the notes of a flute or of a trumpet, which sound like a human voice but signify nothing n. The imperfection of the animal soul had enormous moral and practical implications for the Stoics. Because animals never develop a capacity for reason and therefore have no real speech, human beings have no natural kinship with them. Stoics as early as Zeno, the founder of the school, had argued for the existence of an affinity, which the Stoics called oixetooi?, existing between creatures that are akin because of similarity of interests. Animals possess o?xeioooi? with their offspring and their own kind, as do humans with their offspring and their own kind, but there can be no otxeiooic between humans and animals because of the absence of reason in animals 12.

Sorabji re marks of the fiye^iovix?v in animals, op. cit. p. 42, "Animals, too, are said by the Stoics to have a command center (h?gemonikon). But instead of consisting of reason, it consists merely of their life, sensation and impulse". 11 Philo, De animalibus 99. This valuable dialogue, in which one interlocutor de fends the position that animals are endowed with reason against Philo's own belief, de rived from Stoic sources, that they are irrational, survives only in an Armenian transla tion that seems to date from the sixth century A.

Newmyer dates the Stoic case for the connection between oixeicooi? and language (Off. 1, 50): Sed, quae naturae principia sint communitatis et societatis hu manae [= oixei oi?] repetendum videtur altius; est primum, quod cer nitur in universi generis humanae societate. Eius autem vinculum est ratio et oratio, quae docendo, discendo, communicando, disceptando, iudicando concili?t inter se homines coniungitque naturali quadam societate; ?eque ulla re longius absumus a natura ferarum, in quibus inesse fortitudinem saepe dicimus, ut in equis, in leonibus, iustitiam, aequitatem, bonitatem non dicimus; sunt enim rationis et orationis expertes. Human beings, in Stoic doctrine, can owe nothing to creatures that are so alien to themselves that they cannot understand and ver balize an understanding of morality. Again, Cicero, in his exposition of Stoic ethics, explains that, in consequence of the absence of o?xe?cDGic between humans and animals, man can use animals as he sees fit (Fin. 3, 67): Sed quomodo hominum inter homines iuris esse vincula putant, sic homini nihil iuris cum bestiis. Praeclare enim Chrysippus cetera nata esse hominum causa et deorum, eos autem communitatis et soci etatis suae, ut bestiis homines uti ad utilitatem suam possint sine iniuria. In his treatise De abstinentia, a lengthy and carefully-argued de fense of vegetarianism, the Neoplatonist Porphyry explained that the Stoics had a vested interest in maintaining a special status for human beings above animal creation on the grounds that justice would be confounded if it were extended not only to the rational but to the irra tional as well, a situation which, in the view of the Stoics, would turn the world upside down 13.The Stoics maintained that life would be ut terly impossible for humans if they refrained from using animals to Physics and Metaphysics, Ethics, Religion and Rhetoric, ed. by W.

It is not surprising that a school that held such a position could argue that animals have no value except insofar as they serve man. Chrysippus held that the pig had a soul in place of salt, to preserve it until humans could eat it . Bugs are useful too, in that they keep humans from oversleeping, and mice force humans to put things away carefully 15. In his treatise De sollertia animalium, Plutarch offered a spirited rebuttal of the Stoic denial of reason to animals. Three treatises in that vast collection of philosophical, religious, historical and antiquarian works of Plutarch termed the Moralia are devoted to questions relat ing to the nature and moral qualities of animals 16. De sollertia ani malium, the longest and most closely-reasoned of these treatises, ad vanced the position that observation of animal behavior indicates that all animals possess reason. He stated this position near the outset of the treatise (960A),?jto(pTivau?voi y?? ?x^??, cb? otada, ?xet?xeiv ?fxcaa y?jto?? jc?vxa x? ??a&gt;a ?iavoia? xai Xoyio\iov 17.

The moral conclusion was meant to be They don't have syntax, so we can eat them"'. 16 F.

This situation is slowly chan ging. Among fine recent works on the animal treatises of Plutarch may be mentioned A.

The mistake of the Stoics, in Plutarch's view, was to brand as totally without reason creatures which were not designed by nature to receive the perfection of reason, for while every creature has some degree of reason, perfect reason is the product of care and education (962C),ojuyu?a?o? ??

In Plutarch's view, what raised the behavior of some birds above the level of mere mimicry of human speech, a talent which even the Stoics did not deny to some animals, was the ability of some species of birds to make a conscious choice of what sounds they will utter. Plutarch recounted at length an example to illustrate his case. A barber at Rome, Plutarch informs us, raised as his pet a prodi giously talented jay (Oaujiaoxov xi xqtjuxx... xtxxr]?, 973C) which made a point of repeating every human utterance it heard. Once, a rich man of the neighborhood died, and his funeral passed the barber shop to the accompaniment of loud trumpet blasts. The jay fell utterly silent, and could not be induced to make a sound, so that people assumed the bird had been deafened and shocked into permanent silence. One day, however, the bird's ability to speak returned, but thereafter it uttered only the sounds of the funeral trumpet, perfectly spaced and accu rately reproducing the intervals of sounds and pitch. Plutarch took this as evidence that the bird was consciously meditating over the mu sic of the trumpet and purposely chose to utter only one set of sounds: it had taught itself, and not merely learned from others by a process of imitation. Self-instruction, Plutarch concluded, implied the presence of more reason in animals than would the ability to learn from others (973E), cooxe, ojiep ?qpryv, xfj? et&gt;u.adia?

In Plutarch's view, birds do not imitate human sounds randomly, but reflect internally on what sounds they will utter: that is, their uttered speech (Xoyo? jtQoqpoQixo?) is a product of inter nalized reason (Xoyo? ?v?iofreto?). While Plutarch's case here may strike a modern reader as some what naive, relying as it does on a combination of anecdote and an thropomorphism , it is entirely in keeping with the style of argumen tation frequently encountered in the ancient debate on issues relating to the mental capacities of animals, and from it and such other evi dences of animal rationality as are cited above, Plutarch concluded, against the Stoics, that animals do fall under the purview of human moral concern. Human beings owe animals just treatment. Plutarch made a specific connection between animal language and the call for justice in an affecting scene in his defense of vegetarianism, De esu carnium, wherein he imagined an animal at the point of slaughter cry ing out to his slayers. Humans mistakenly take these animal utter ances as meaningless ((porv?? ?v??^?ovc, e?vai ?oxoDjxev, 994E), in stead of as the cries for justice (?ixaioXoYta?) that they are 19. In Plutarch's view, animals have at least an elementary concept of justice which they try to express through a language that humans cannot un derstand. The Stoic contention that humans can owe nothing to crea tures that cannot understand and verbalize a conception of morality, cannot, in Plutarch's estimation, be allowed to stand. The debate on animal rationality as it manifests itself in language, with its consequences for human morality, has developed in recent decades in directions which the Stoics and Plutarch could scarcely have envisioned. Yet one line of argument favored by some modern opponents of animal rights would be entirely comprehensible to Plutarch and the Stoics, for it is a linear descendant of the Stoic case against animals outlined above. Contractarianism, also called Con 18 Philosophers and ethologists eager to accord moral status to animals remain hi ghly sensitive to charges of anthropomorphism. Griffin, op. cit. p. 24, observes on this question, "When one carefully examines such charges of anthropomorphism, it turns out that they entail the implicit assumption that whatever it is suggested that animals might do, or think, really is a uniquely human attribute. Such an assumption begs the question being asked because it presupposes a negative answer and is thus literally a confession of prejudgment or prejudice". The problem of anthropomorphism in animal study is treated in the essays in R. W. Mitchell, N. S. Thompson, H. L. Miles, ed., An thropomorphism, Anecdotes and Animals, Albany, N.Y. 1997. Anthropomorphism and its impact on studies of animal language is treated in Mitchell, Thompson and Miles, op. cit pp. 365-404. 19 For an analysis of this striking passage, see Newmyer, 'Plutarch on the Moral Grounds for Vegetarianism', cit. p. 42.</page><page sequence="10">108 S. T. Newmyer tractualism and Contract Theory, contends that a human being cannot accord rights to a creature that cannot enter into a "contract" to re spect, in turn, the rights of humans. Such a contract rests upon mutual agreement of the contracting parties, and must be rationally reflected on and then vocalized. While traces of contractarian thought have been detected by ethical philosophers in thinkers as early as the Greek Sophists, the position first became prominent in the work on Thomas Hobbes, and became influential in argumentation against the position that animals have moral obligations toward animals through the work of philosopher John Rawls 20. Fundamental to the contractarian stance is the assumption that participants in such a contract are reasoning agents, individuals who consciously choose to enter into a contract to respect each others' rights. Contractarian philosopher David Gauthier sees " ... a deep connection between morals and rational choice" 21. This choice implicitly excludes animals since Contractarians assume that animals are irrational. As Gauthier maintains, "In grounding morals in rational choice, we exclude relations with non-human crea tures from the sphere of moral constraint" 22. Contractarian arguments have recently been used tellingly against animals by philosopher Peter Carruthers, who contends that, while some animals, including mammals, may have beliefs and de sires, they do not thereby qualify as rational agents because agents must agree with each other on their future interactions. Such agree ment would require language. Complete mastery of a human language would qualify animals to be agents since they could communicate their beliefs and desires through it, but Carruthers denies that any existing animal language experimentation proves conclusively that animals can master human language. Carruthers strikingly echoes Stoic argu ments when he asserts, "It may be our distinctive possession of an in nately structured language that underlies our uniqueness as rational 20 For a historical sketch of the development of contractarian theory, see D. Gau thier, Morals by Agreement, Oxford 1986, pp. 1-10. J. Rawls,^4 Theory of Justice, Cam bridge Ma. 1971, remained himself somewhat tentative in his remarks against animals, noting of them, p. 512: "...It does not seem possible to extend the contract doctrine so as to include them in a natural way". While subsequent contractarian theorists seem to consider Rawls the father of the modern contractarian stance against animals, traces of such thought can be detected earlier. G. R. Grice, The Grounds of Moral Judgement, Cambridge 1967, pp. 95-154, argued against according rights to human embryos, to future generations of humans, to the mentally defective, to children under the age of ten, and to animals on the grounds that none of these classes can understand what Grice cal led "the contract ground of obligation". 21 Gauthier, op. cit. p. 2. 22 Gauthier, op. cit. p. 285.</page><page sequence="11">Speaking of Beasts 109 agents" 23. Indeed, Carruthers goes so far as to acknowledge that, in the view of the Contractarian, morality is after all a human construct designed to include only humans in its purview. Animals by definition fall beyond the pale of human consideration, an attitude which closely mirrors the assumptions that underlie the Stoic position on the moral status of animals outlined in this study. "Morality", Carruthers con cludes, "is viewed as constructed by human beings, in order to facili tate interactions between human beings, and to make possible a life of co-operative community. This is, indeed, an essential part of the gov erning assumption of contractualism" 24. In the contractarian insis tence upon interactions of humans in a co-operative community exclu sive to humans, one seems to hear echoes of the Stoic doctrine of o?xeicaai? that was used by that school to insure that animals were ac corded no part in the sphere of human moral concern. The contractarian position has not gone unchallenged, and the work of cognitive ethologists has served to corroborate, in some re spects, the arguments raised by Plutarch against the Stoics. While some philosophers have questioned the very validity of contract mak ing as a ground for moral considerability, and would substitute such considerations as the ability to feel pain, the fact of fellow-creature hood, or the mere possession of life as sufficient grounds for rights possession 25, all of which considerations might well have appealed to the humane Plutarch, other thinkers point to research indicating that gorillas can in fact inflect the signs employed in American Sign Lan guage to alter their meanings. Some gorillas, including the famous Koko, have shown the capacity for inventing new signs, thereby creat ing original vocabulary. Certain orangutans have learned to compre hend spoken English and to respond appropriately to sign language 26. Science seems to be moving in the direction of vindicating Plutarch's 23 P. Carruthers, The Animals Issue: Moral Theory in Practice, Cambridge 1992, p. 143. 24 Carruthers, op. cit. p. 102. 25 Contractarian assumptions are searchingly questioned in S. R. L. Clark, The Moral Status of Animals, Oxford 1984, pp. 22-27. An interesting challenge is presented to the "human beings only" view of Contractarianism in B. E. Rollin, Animal Rights and Human Morality, Buffalo, N.Y. 1992, p. 36, "Even if Rawls is correct that only rational beings can enter into the original contract position, it does not follow at all that such in dividuals would necessarily adopt moral rules that apply only to themselves, and that exclude animals from concern or protection." K. E. Goodpaster, "On Being Morally Considerable', Journ. of Philos. 75, 1978, pp. 308-325, argues for a "life criterion" as sufficient grounds for moral standing: for a creature to be alive entitles it to consideration. 26 De Grazia, op. cit. pp. 192-198.</page><page sequence="12">110 S. T. Newmyer belief that animals possess some degree of reason, and can manifest their rational capacity in language manipulation. Philosopher David De Grazia concludes about such evidence, in words that echo Plutarch's much simpler formulation: " ...It seems most reasonable to say that some apes and cetaceans have used, and many of their con specifics can no doubt learn, certain forms of language" 27. In recent years, a dimension has been added to the debate over animal language that could have far-reaching moral and legal consequences. Some ethologists and philosophers point to the demonstrably advanced in traspecies communication skills of such animals as gorillas and dol phins, who appear at the same time to endeavor to communicate with humans who have not yet learned to decipher their utterances, a situa tion curiously foreshadowed in Plutarch's scene of an animal at slaughter pleading for justice (De esu carnium 994E), to argue that such creatures should be accorded personhood, a notion deeply dis turbing to those who claim a unique position for humans in the scale oi creation . The debate over animal rationality and its manifestation in a ca pacity for language remains unresolved, as it did for Plutarch and his Stoic opponents. While the terms in which the Greek thinkers framed their position lack the scientific bases upon which contemporary argu ments rest, many of the intellectual assumptions and methodological approaches of contemporary philosophy and ethology are clearly ad umbrated in the formulations of the arguments for and against the idea that animals possess language that are presented in this study. The incorporation and expansion of Stoic o?xeUooi? theory in contrac tarian doctrine is only one of many instances, still largely unacknowl edged by philosophers who advocate or oppose the notion of "animal rights", of the survival and vitality of classical ethics in the ongoing debate over man's potential obligations toward other species. This de bate cannot be properly understood in its historical context until its ancient precedents are acknowledged. Duquesne University 27 De Grazia, op. cit. p. 198. Griffin, op. cit. p. 215, observes that some dolphins can respond correctly to verbal commands in English of as many as five words in length, and seem to be able to distinguish between words which constitute the subjects of sen tences from those which form direct objects. 28 On the controversy over considering non-human animals as persons, see S. F. Sapontzis, Morals, Reason, and Animals, Philadelphia 1987, pp. 47-70; R. Rodd, Bio logyr, Ethics and Animals, Oxford 1990, pp. 251-255; and De Grazia, op. cit. pp. 265-266.</page></plain_text>
