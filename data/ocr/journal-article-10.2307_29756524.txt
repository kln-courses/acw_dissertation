<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tapan Kumar Das Gupta, Der vajra: eine vedische Waffe, {Alt- und Neu-Indische Studien herausgegeben vom Seminar f?r Kultur und Geschichte Indiens an der "Universit?t Hamburg, 16) (Wiesbaden, Franz Steiner Verlag, 1975; vi (unnumbered) - 119 pp., illustrations in the text). This is an important book for both the archae? ologist and the student of iconography. The author describes the several varieties of vajras depicted in the art of India and other surrounding countries and compares them with the Gandharan variety. This seems to be derived from an altogether different stem, presumably the Greek keraunbs or thunderbolt of Zeus. The purely Indian type of vajra is then con? sidered in the light of the descriptions we find in Vedic and Br?hmana literature. The author comes to the conclusion that the vajra is neither a "thunderbolt" nor a "club", even less a "harpoon", as has been suggested by some scholars; he suggests that the vajra was a real weapon that could be used both by hurling it (as D.P. Agrawal has suggested) and by grasping it for the purpose of cutting, splitting or smashing. The author also believes that the well-known "anthropomorphic figures" that form the bulk of the "copper hoards" from the Gange tic basin, are actual vajras. This is undoubtedly the most challenging part of the book and one must say that ? though the author himself does not feel certain about this identification ? nobody will be allowed to deal with the "anthropomorphic figures" without taking Das Gupta's hypothesis into serious account. A few drawings and photographs illustrate the way the copper part of the vajra could be com? pleted with a wooden one. Though the resulting object does not seem to be sufficiently handy and manageable, its resemblance to the weapon of 279</page><page sequence="2">Indra and other deities in Indian iconography is really striking. The author actually suggests the different ways in which the weapon could be used (pp. 77-78) but I am afraid he does not succeed in dispelling all shadows of doubt. Das Gupta himself points to another difficulty, arising from the fact that the distribution of the so-called "anthropomorphic figures" is limited within the Gangetic basin (p. 80), while one would expect to find them in the whole area where the vajra (Avestan vazra) is known from literary sources, i.e. also in Iran and the North West of India. A six-page English summary concludes the book. Maurizio Taddei</page></plain_text>
