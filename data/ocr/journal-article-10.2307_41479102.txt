<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Development of Platonov's Narrative Perspective in the Context of the 1920s Robert Hödel Hamburg University Translated from the German by Judith Wermuth- Atkinson1 In the late 1920s Platonov developed a new narrative perspective that was altogether unique, and not only in the Russian context. There do not seem to be any authors in either German or any other literature with whom Platonov can be compared. Robert Walser, whose oscillation between narrator speech and character speech comes closer to Platonov's style of narration than anything else, writes in a clear language that uses rhetorical techniques, and Franz Kafka, whose unreal-real space recalls Platonov's sleepwalking reality, focuses much more clearly on the protagonists' inner world. Platonov's remarkable and extraordinary style raises questions about its origin. We will take three steps in the analysis of this question, which we would like to approach considering Platonov's own oeuvre as well as the entire context of early twentieth-century Russian literature. First, we should characterize Platonov's narrative style in his "mature" prose fiction. This characterization will be based on the novel Chevengur and will consider the novel in relation to two narrative reference poles - free indirect discourse and ska% As a second step, we will look at Platonov's early prose fiction, which will be discussed in the literary and historical context of the 1920s. Our third step deals with the question whether Platonov's narrative perspective can be defined on the basis of formal principles at all, and what the actual effect of this specific prose fiction is, apart from its form. 1. Characterization of the Narrative Perspective in Chevengur The two poles between which the narrative style of Platonov's mature prose fiction falls, free indirect discourse and ska % focus on two different narrative authorities - the object of the narrative (the literary character) and the subject of the narrative (the narrator). 1 Translations from the Russian are provided by the editors of this volume in consultation with Sergey Levchin. Ulbandus 14 (2011/2012)</page><page sequence="2">The Development of Platonov's Narrative Perspective 131 1.1 Object of the Narrative: Free Indirect Discourse Free indirect discourse presupposes a clear distinction between narrator speech and character speech. This distinction is the premise for the possibility to recognize, within the narrative, the consciousness and the speech of the character. Historically, free indirect discourse first becomes clearly outlined in Russian literature in the realist era. It does not exist in the literature of classicism, since the classical text is entirely dominated by the rhetorical devices of authorial speech. "Alien speech" ( chusfiaia rech' in Bakhtin's terms) is generally still under the spell of author's speech here: either it plays the role of a mouthpiece of the author or it is distinguished in a polemic way. In romantic prose fiction the involvement of the narrator with the protagonists is still too strongly expressed to allow for a clear demarcation of alien speech within the narrative; narrator speech and character speech are still too close to each other with regard to the general intonation. Thus, the subjectivity of the narrator undermines the objectivity of the protagonists. Only with the removed and sober narrator of realism does character speech become emancipated enough from narrator speech that it can be recognized within the narrative as alien speech. In effect, the objectivity of the protagonist increases at the expense of the subjectivity of the narrator. In modernist prose fiction, this emancipation of the literary character progresses, while the narrator steps back more and more. He not only parts with the independent ideological positions characteristic of the realist text, but also becomes less visible in the choice of scenes and the entire plot structure, which are now noticeably motivated by the perspective of the characters. In this way, the old hierarchy of perspective gradually becomes dismantled, and we are left - in the extreme case - with the kind of poetics we see in Pil'niak's novel Golji god (The Naked Year). Platonov's mature prose fiction has to be seen in the context of this development of dismantling of hierarchical perspective. In fact, Platonov's "weakening" of the narrator is even more radical than Pil'niak's and reaches an unexpectedly high degree, for he almost completely gives up "neutral narration."2 Narrative de-neutralization is particularly apparent in Chevengur in segments like "Proiskhozhdenie mastera" ("The Origins of a Master") and "Potomok rybaka" ("The Fisherman's Descendant"), where almost every single syntactic unit shows traces of character consciousness. Other episodes, such as "Novokhopersk" (the first chapter of the manuscript "Stroiteli strany," 2 I draw here on Chudakov's term mitrai' noe povestvovanie. (A. P. Chudakov, Poetika Chekhova [Moscow: Nauka, 1971], 27.)</page><page sequence="3">1 32 Robert Hödel "Builders of the Country"), in which an autobiographically oriented first- person narration emerges, are less apparently radical. The same could be said about the scene in Moscow at the end of the novel, a scene that Platonov tried to publish under the tide "Dvoe liudei" ("Two People").3 As a comparison between a variant of "Stroiteli strany"4 and the final manuscript of Chevengur shows, Platonov undermines the classical distinctions between character speech and narrator speech in a systematic and determined way. He does this mainly by reducing authorial comments and direct speech, and by abandoning rhetorical language devices. For example, the following (idiomatically neutral) words, which identify Dvanov as a protagonist who mocks Kopenkin, were not included in Chevengur. «Софья Александровна! - заговорил Дванов. - Товарищ Копенкин смертельно влюблен. Правда, это не похоже на него? . . . Он любит Розу Люксембург5 "Sofia Aleksandrovna!" Dvanov began. "Comrade Kopenkin is deathly in love. That is unlike him, isn't it? ... He loves Rosa Luxemburg.

Sofia Aleksandrovna backed away from them. "Hello, Sofia Aleksandrovna!" Dvanov spoke in a rough, unfamiliar voice. "Weren't expecting such company, eh?... Ah, and Gratov's here. Come to keep an eye out? Good! Mrachinskii looked at Sofia Aleksandrovna condescendingly. He was deciding whether he ought to kill those guys and possess Sofia Aleksandrovna for a single day, or whether she was not worth such exertions. Revised version (from Chevengur ): Двое сошли с коней - Мрачинский и Дванов. Соня отступилась от них. Перед ней стоял Саша, обросший, грязный и печальный. Мрачинский глядел на Софью Александровну снисходительно: ее жалкое тело не стоило его внимания и усилий .7 Two got down from the horse - Mrachinskii and Dvanov. Sofia Aleksandrovna backed away from them. Before her stood Sasha, unkempt, dirty and mournful. Mrachinskii looked at Sofia Aleksandrovna condescendingly: her pitiful body was not worth his attention and exertions. Since the direct speech in the fragment from "Stroiteli strany" is highly rhetorical and the narrator speech is grammatically correct, it is not difficult to recognize the author's judgment on this "alien voice" which is "strange" and "coarsening" («чужим огрубевшим голосом»), or the speech of Mrachinskii in "these boys" («этих парней ») and in "take possession just for a day" («завладеть на &lt;утки&gt;&gt;). The impression is that of a classical literary style. In Chevengur the approach is very different.

Further citations from this work will appear parenthetically within the body of the text.</page><page sequence="5">1 34 Robert Hödel obrosshiiy gria^nyi, and pechalnyi ("stubbly, dirty and mournful"), could be interpreted in two different ways: It may describe someone who is feeling sorrow or being sad ( ispytyvaiushchii chuvstvo pechali, grustnyi) or someone who evokes sorrow ( vy^yvaiushchii ' navevaiushchii péchai*). In the first case, the epithet would incline more toward narrator speech, which, precisely because of that, would reach the limits of the literary and linguistic norm. In the second case, we hear rather the subjective pity of Sofia Aleksandrovna. If we look from the perspective of the character, then the other two epithets ( obrosshii and gria^nyi), and with them the entire sentence, also would be considered part of the consciousness of the character (Sofia Aleksandrovna). Both perspectives are represented simultaneously in order to prevent the reader from unambiguously attaching the epithets either to the consciousness of the narrator or to that of the character. The perspective begins to split and to disintegrate as in a cubistic painting. The oscillation between narrator speech and character speech in the second part of the excerpt from Chevengur is also opaque. The speech of Mrachinskii, which we hear originally, and which resonates in the entire sentence, can be best reconstructed in the phrase "was worth it" (in Russian, in the verb form stoilo). At the same time, the speech of the character is so very little distinct from the speech of the narrator that here we could speak only partly of free indirect discourse. This uncertainty in the terminology is symptomatic of the whole novel: on the one hand, we can speak of a radical deconstruction of free indirect discourse, but on the other, we can see the principle of free indirect discourse infiltrating the constant and far-reaching interference between the text of the narrator and the text of the characters. Even inquit-formulae, which traditionally are considered narrator's speech, evoke here the sense of an omnipresent "tongue-tied" ( kosnoiayychnyi ) speech. See, for instance, the following lines from Chevengur. - Умру, ей-богу умру, Захар Павлович, - испугался солгать бобыль... (191). "I'll die, by God I will, Zakhar Pavlovich," the recluse was frightened of telling a lie. Где жил Шумилин, Дванов точно не зная... (257). Where Shumilin lived, Dvanov did not know exactly. . .</page><page sequence="6">The Development of Platonov's Narrative Perspective 1 35 The impression that a "style of a non-style"8 is omnipresent in Chevengur is based most of all on what we call "Platonovisms." By "Platonovism," I mean using a lexeme while completely disregarding language norm and, instead, attaching to it the (utopian) image of a just world in which we are connected. It is no coincidence that Platonov criticism discusses such lexemes and their usage extensively (e.g. "thinking," "life," "death," "human being," or "body" [dumať, ¡фг^гг', smert', chelovek , telo[). They represent key-concepts of Platonov's worldview. In order to describe the effect of such Platonovisms more specifically, we should look at them as part of the internal system of speech in Chevengur. The table on the following page shows that the speech of each character is actually differentiated by the frequency of the use of regional, social and official vocabulary and expressions, as well as by the degree of expressivity and language consciousness.9 Yet, this (rudimentary) speech differentiation is undermined by the omnipresence of Platonovisms. In addition, the Platonovisms appear not only in the speech of almost every single character, but they are also central to the formation of the narrator speech. In most cases, however, the Platonovisms within the narrator's speech are closely connected to the consciousness of a character (in other words we could interpret them as free indirect discourse). Nevertheless, Platonov involves almost all characters in this approach too, and, as a result, the characterization of the voice of any character we seem to be hearing through the "quasi-free indirect discourse" becomes much weaker. Moreover, we find Platonovisms in the narrator's speech even in places where the immediate context makes the possibility of the presence of a particular character less likely. 8 See E.

They both stand for the desired new world.10 Chepurnyt «Когда пролетариат живет себе один, то коммунизм у него сам выходит» (431). "When the proletariat lives all on its own, communism just happens." Kopenkin : «[...] сказано тебе от губисполкома - закончи к лету социализм!..» (293). "...what did the provincial executive committee say: 'get socialism done by summertime!'..." Dostoevsky : «Даю социализм! Еще рожь не поспеет, а социализм будет готов!» (293-294). "I'm churning out socialism! It'll be ready before the rye's good to pick!" Gopner. «Мы там [...] смерим весь коммунизм, снимем с него точный чертеж [...]» (309). "We'll . . . take all the measurements of their communism, draw up a precise blueprint ..." A . Dvanov. «Вы должны поставить дело настолько умно и сложно, чтобы не было никакой очевидности коммунизма, а на самом деле он налицо» (305). 10 Here, it is clear that these two concepts only partly match Marxist ideas. In this regard, the comments of two contemporaries of Platonov are very informative. One of the editors of Krasnaia nov' Vs. Ivanov, says the following about the fragment of the novel Konchina Kopenkina {Kopenkin* s Demisè ): «Т. Раскольникову. В первом рассказе заменить везде "коммунизм" словом свободный строй (или просто вычеркнуть)...» ("То Comrade RaskoPnikov. In the first story the word 'communism' should be replaced everywhere with free construction [or simply deleted]..."). (Shubina, "VstupitePnaia sta'ia i primechaniia," 218). Similarly, the secretary in charge of the journal Novyi mir, N. Zamoshkin, says about the fragment "Dvoe liudei" ("Two People"): «В рассказе все интроспективно, люди взяты как бы в изоляции от всего (словечки о соц&lt;иалистическом&gt; стр&lt;оительстве&gt; и пр. не в счет)» ("In the story everything is introspective; people are taken as if in isolation from everything [the expressions about 'socialist construction and so on' aside]"). (Ibid., 217.)</page><page sequence="9">1 38 Robert Hödel "You must set things up so cleverly and complexly that there is no overt evidence of communism, and yet it's right there in front of you." With regard to Dvanov's words, we cannot exclude the possibility that he adjusts his language behavior to the surrounding environment - here particularly to the chairman of the commune "Druzhba bedniaka" ("The Camaraderie of the Poor"). However, the way Dvanov adjusts is quite similar to the way the narrator himself adjusts. Thus, Dvanov's speech cannot be understood as ironic, for he too shares the desire of the chairman for a new common life. His speech is as constant and independent from his interlocutor as the speech of the narrator, but it is also "alien speech." Serbinov, «Раньше социализму угрожала вошь, теперь - бурьян» (513). "Lice threatened socialism before; now it's weeds." Serbinov's speech here is to be seen as ironic, for it is obvious that he too will adapt to "Dvanov's Chevengur": "You'll get used to us here" ("ты у нас обтерпишься"), says Chepurnyi when he welcomes Serbinov to the city, (527). Narrator, In most cases the narrator's speech is closely related to one of the characters. The following formulations in his speech all seem tied primarily to one character: "socialism came true" («социализм сбылся», 418); "communism is already present in Chevengur" («в Чевенгуре уже находится коммунизм», 431); and "finished communism" «доделанный коммунизм», 443). By contrast, these sentences appear to be independent of any character: Ночью Дванов и Копенкин уехали, еще раз пристрожив Достоевского насчет устройства социализма (297-298). Dvanov and Kopenkin left at night, after once again warning Dostoevsky about the establishment of socialism.</page><page sequence="10">The Development of Platonov's Narrative Perspective 1 39 Следующие дни над Чевенгуром, как и с самого начала коммунизма, стояли сплошь солнечные, а ночами нарождалась новая луна (465). The next few days over Chevengur were completely sunny, as they had been from the very start of communism, while at night a new moon was being born. As a consequence, we begin to suspect that the narrator participates in the "speech community Chevengur."11 Thus, free indirect discourse appears to be very productive in explaining a phenomenon that can no longer be described as free indirect discourse. Rather, free indirect discourse could be compared here to the terms "style of a non-style" (Markstein) and " priem neostraneniia ," or "device of ^familiarization" (Meerson). 1.2 Subject of the narrative: Skaz Considering Russian narrative tradition, we cannot but see that the constant uniform deformation of both narrator and character speech generates a second narrative concept - the narrative form " ska ^ (ska^ovaia forma povestvovaniia ).12 The main characteristic of ska% is the presence of a narrator ( skapte/ ') who is distinct from the author and whose speech covers the entire narrative and overshadows even character speech. In this way, the narrator mutates, so to speak, against his will, into a (literary) character. In the context of the prose fiction of the 1920s, Zoshchenko should be our first example, for he is an author who comes very close to Platonov through his ambivalent relation to his characters - a relation marked by ironic distance and pity. In the case of Zoshchenko, as with Platonov, we can follow this "overshadowing" of direct speech by narrator speech, even at the level of the text's "microstructure." In other words, we can recognize the writing of both these authors without a doubt, even in very small segments from their works. Let us look at an 11 In the monograph mentioned above I explain this speech community as the narrative version of a Utopian society. The narrator too speaks the language of the "communitas" who are free from any hierarchy. In this way, he testifies for the complete destruction of all (linguistically) hierarchical barriers. In that sense this "tongue-tied" ( kosnojayychie ) speech, ^hich concerns all narrative authorities, could be defined as no one's language ("uglossia").

Platonova," in Sprache und Er^ählhaltung, 249-260.</page><page sequence="11">140 Robert Hödel excerpt from the short story "Aristokratka" ("The Lady Aristocrat") to illustrate this statement with an example. The first-person narrator, Grigorii Ivanovich, has managed to invite a lady aristocrat, his beloved comrade and housemate, to the theater. There, they sit in different tiers, he high up in the cheap seats and she in the orchestra with the other aristocrats. Not seeing well from the gallery bothers Grigorii much less than the fact that the woman will not stop ordering at the buffet during intermission. Afraid that he may not have enough money to pay, he manages to ask the question: «Натощак - не много ли? Может вытошнить» ("On an empty stomach - isn't that too much? It might make you sick"). The lady aristocrat answers promptly: «Нет, мы привыкшие» ("No, we are used to this").13 The first-person narrator is completely compromised by the lower- class colloquial phrase «мы привыкшие». For it suggests either that the lady aristocrat is simply an ordinary person or that the narrator has no idea how the language of the pre-Revolutionary aristocracy had sounded. Since Grigorii fails to see the apparent irony, in either case he seems mentally outclassed. This becomes even more significant when, simply on the basis of the behavior of this lady aristocrat, he decides that the whole aristocratic class is reprehensible and thus exposes his own limited horizon. We see a significant difference between Zoshchenko and Platonov precisely in this degradation of the narrator. Even if the term ska% were able to explain why we find Platonovisms equally in character speech and in narrator speech, it would still be inappropriate to use it with regard to Platonov's narrative perspective. According to Eikhenbaum's definition of ska% as "orientation toward oral speech" ( ustanovka na ustnuiu rech ), as well as to Bakhtin's view of it as orientation toward "alien speech" ( ustanovka na chu^huiu rech*)&gt; an important feature of ska% is the distance between expected (normative) speech and speech as actually produced (differing from the norm). A narrator who remains at a distance from the implicit author speaks throughout the whole narrative. Making this distance, the fundamental feature of ska % into a central theme could be interpreted as a democratic attempt to bridge the gap between "the people" and the educated class.14 By contrast, in Platonov the distance 13 M. Zoshchenko, Ivbrannoe (Leningrad: Lenizdat, 1981), 28, italics mine. 14 Cf. E. Zamiatin's essay "O iazyke" (1920-1921): Если мы оглянемся назад, мы увидим: чем ближе было общество к феодальному строю, тем больше, резче было различие между литературным и разговорным языком Я считаю это явление - сближение литературного и разговорного языка - очень жизненным; оно идет в ногу с общей исторической тенденцией демократизации всей жизни.</page><page sequence="12">The Development of Platonov's Narrative Perspective 141 between implicit author and narrator or between narrator and character seems to be abolished. Brodsky formulates this closeness in the narrative as follows: "Platonov subordinated himself to the language of his utopia."15 The image of "subordination" affirms the unity of author, narrator, and character, and at the same time implies a diversion from the expected norm (in other words a distance from the "language of the time"). We can see a paradox here. It is as if the reader distances her/himself from her/his own expectations. This very paradox demonstrates the reason why we cannot describe Platonov's narrative either as free indirect discourse or as ska% Free indirect discourse supposes a narrator who is not subordinated, but rather one at a distance, out of the foreground. By comparison, ska% is not compatible with abolishing the borderlines between implicit author and narrator. 2. Narrative Perspective in Platonov's Early Prose Fiction Based on the literary and historical context of the revolutionary era, we can distinguish four orientations with regard to the narrative perspective of Platonov's early prose fiction. These orientations represent only certain trends in each of his prose texts, which means that generally they appear only in combination. In the criticism on the early short stories, the different combinations are described mostly as an "awkward," "schematic," or "contradictory" style.16 And in the academic edition of Platonov's early work, edited by Natalia Kornienko, we find the following assessment of Platonov's early approach: "In these years Platonov experimented a great deal... He tried all possible forms of textual 'composition' - from fantasy to refined, naturalistic sketching" («Платонов в эти годы много экспериментирует... Он пробует всевозможные формы "сочинения" текста - от фантазии до изощренной натуралистической зарисовки...»).17 If we look back, we see: the closer society was to the feudal system, the clearer the difference was between literary and spoken language... I consider this occurrence - the convergence of written and spoken language - vital; it occurs in step with the general historical tendency of the democratization of all life. (E.

In most cases, this perspective is expressed by a first- person narrator. The overwhelming presence of this narrator reflects the lyrical subject of the poetry Platonov was writing at the same time. For prose, his language is very effusive: it is constructed on the basis of rhythmical and euphonic principles, and it is iterative, elliptical, and highly metaphorical. At the same time, this language represents the literary norm, and its style tends to be lofty and dramatic. Other representatives of this literary style, whose texts served as models for Platonov: are Belyi (Petersburg), informed mostly by Nietzsche; the Futurists (e.g., Khlebnikov's "Menagerie"), Gastev (. Poetry of the Worker's Blow , e.g. "We Grow Out of Iron"); Zamiatin ("The Cave"); the Smithy group; Whitman, and others.18 Platonov writes these poetic prose texts in the first few "Voronezh Years." Typical of this period are the short stories "Ocherednoi" ("Successive," 1918), "Serega i ia" ("Serega and I," 1920), "V zvezdnoi pustyne" ("In the Starry Desert," 1921), and others. In the following excerpt from "Ocherednoi," the rhythm is expressed through repetition, assonance, alliteration, as well as through short speech entities: Что-то свистит и смеется; что-то запертое, сильное, зверски беспощадное хочет воли - и не вырвется, - и воет, и визжит, и яростно бьется, и вихрится в одиночестве и бесконечной злобе...19 Something whistles and laughs; something locked up, strong, monstrously ruthless wants its freedom - and cannot break free - and it howls, and squeals, and struggles furiously, and whirls in its loneliness and endless spite... This narrative style, which could be associated with the powerful language of a poet, is completely contradictory to the image of the "subordinate" author of Platonov's mature prose fiction. 2.2. Ornamental prose of everyday life Stylistically, the "ornamental prose of everyday life" is closely related to Platonov's poetic prose fiction, for it too is characterized by iteration, and by a rhythmical and euphonic structure. However, it is distinguished from 18 For more on Platonov's influences, see T. Seifrid, "On the Genesis of Platonov's Literary Stvle in the Voronezh Period," Russian Literature 23 (1988): 367-386. 19 Platonov, Sochineniia , vol. 1, book 1, 137.</page><page sequence="14">The Development of Platonov's Narrative Perspective 1 43 the poetic prose by its focus on everyday life (byt)?Q In these works, the narrative is penetrated by the language and consciousness of the described milieu.21 Platonov achieves this primarily by using direct speech, but at times the speech of the narrator also is "infected" with the vocabulary and the syntax of the protagonists' speech. The observed juxtaposition of different stylistic layers is due to the fact that in most cases the protagonists differ from the narrator with respect to education. Nevertheless, as in 2.1, here too, the (authoritative) status of the narrator and his language and literary norm remain untouched. Behind the narrator, there always stands the author, who, being a master of language, moves as a skillful artist, back and forth from normative language to character speech. (In this context Brodsky speaks of "stylistic connoisseurship" [«стилистическое гурманство»]).22 This means also that the perspective remains divided hierarchically. Frequendy, the narrator who is close to the author steps back, in order to be able to express the point of view of the character more vividly. ( Skat, 5 which is widespread in this literary orientation, turns out to be the most radical form of the author's self-effacement.) Platonov was not alone in producing works in this style. Other authors who wrote "ornamental prose of everyday life" include Remizov, Zamiatin, Nikitin, Leonov, Fedin, Prishvin, Zoshchenko, Babel', and Pil'niak. Most of Platonov's texts in this style were written between 1920 and 1922. These include: "Chul'dik i Epishka (1920); "Pop" ("The Priest," 1920); "Apalitych" (1920); "Danilok" (1922); "Tiuten', Vitiuten' i Protegalen" (1922); and "Prikliuchenia Baklazhanova" ("Adventures of Baklazhanov," 1922). Some, however, were written later, such as "Tsyganskii merin" ("Gypsy Gelding," 1926). These are usually short stories about "folkloristic," mosdy marginalized, characters. Their 20 Some critics have defined this genre as that of the "exaggerated naturalist sketch" («изощренная натуралистическая зарисовка»). See Platonov, Sochineniia , vol. 1, book 1, 494-495. 21 Zamiatin writes in "O iazyke" ("On language"): ..язык - должен быть языком изображаемой среды и эпохи. Автора совершенно не должно быть видно. Положение о том, что язык диалогов должен быть языком изображаемой среды - уже стало бесспорным. Но я распространяю этот тезис - на все произведение целиком. ...the language should be the language of the depicted environ and epoch. The author should be entirely unseen. The idea that the language of dialogue out to be the language of the depicted environment - that is already indisputable. But I am extending this thesis to the work as a whole.

Stylistically, however, these narratives are quite different from Chevengur , for in these short stories there is a very definite distance between narrator and character. The narrators in these works may feel sympathy with the stories' comical characters without, apparently, sharing any philosophical or ideological standpoints with them. We see a similar divergence when it comes to language anomalies - specifically the kind of anomalies that could be defined as "Platonovisms" in his mature prose fiction. In these early stories the language anomalies do not show any signs of a collapsed hierarchy of perspective but, on the contrary, reveal ornamental "word art." A passage from the short story "Apalitych" serves as a good example: Апалитыч заржавел от горя и жизни, , борода его давно высыпалась, и он выглядывал пожилым молодчиком. Обувь Апалитыч лепил из старья, которое он ходил набирать в городе. Опорки выходили из-под его рук жениховскими сапогами.23 Apalitych had rusted from grief and life , his beard had fallen out long ago, and he peeked through as an old lad. His shoes Apalitych slapped together from trash, which he would go to the city to accumulate. Worn-through shoes emerged from under his hands as a bridegroom's boots. The entire context is marked here by an extremely superior manner of language use so that even the combination of in the phrase "of sorrow and life" («от горя и жизни») comes under the spell of "stylistic connoisseurs hip." 2.3 Realist Narrative Tradition The realist narrative tradition of the 1910s and 1920s is characterized by the same authorial narrator as in the prose of Turgenev and Tolstoy: one who represents the literary norm. This narrative speech is marked in a way different from the poetic prose and the "ornamental prose of everyday life," and the language here is highly referential rather than reflective of the author. Andreev, Bunin, Gorky, Kuprin and others are good representatives of this kind of prose fiction. 23 Platonov, Sochineniia, vol. 1, book 1, 147.</page><page sequence="16">The Development of Platonov's Narrative Perspective 145 The early Platonov is closer to realist literature, especially in his science-fiction stories like "Markun" (1920), "Zhazhda nishchego" ("The Thirst of the Beggar," 1920), "Nevozmozhnoe" ("The Impossible," 1921), or "Potomki sol'ntsa" ("Descendents of the Sun," 1922). This fact could be explained, on the one hand, by the focus on popular scientific topics whose preferred vocabulary belongs to normative language,24 and, on the other, by the influence of Platonov's own work as a journalist, characterized by the use of referential normative language. Indeed, some of his short stories from these years are in the gray area between fiction and reportage. One can compare, for instance, the fictional "Poema mysli" ("The Poem of Thought," 1920-1921) and "Satana mysli" ("The Arch-Enemy of Thought," 1921), with the feuilleton - "about bastards," according to its subtitle - "Dusha cheloveka ne prilichnoe zhivotnoe" ("The Soul of Man is Not a Polite Animal," 1921). In the context just discussed, it is important to keep in mind that these short stories employ free indirect discourse with clear borderlines. This is also the case in the short story "Markun," where we find passages such as the following: Маркун верил в себя. Знал, что нет, не может быть ошибки в спрятанной машине. Она пойдет. Ее мощь безгранична. Он, Маркун, победил многие силы. Никто еще ничего не знает. Не знает , что это он дал человеку в его немощные руки новый молот безумной мощи.25 Markun believed in himself. He knew there had not been - and could not be - any mistake in the secret machine. It will run . Its might is limitless . He, Markun, has conquered many forces. No one knows anything about it jet. No one knows that it ivas he, who had put into man's feeble hands a new hammer of delirious might. As in 2.1 and 2.2, there are no recognizable features of the mature narrative style here either. This fact becomes clear when "Markun" is compared to the short story "Korova" ("The Cow," 1938), which is also told from the perspective of a boy. While narrative and action are clearly distinguished in "Markun," a fact that makes clearly delineated free indirect discourse possible (cf. the shift in tenses in the excerpt above), the narrator of "Korova" falls into a tone of voice which cannot be 24 The literary critic S. Shilova described the short story Markun as: «Оригинальный этюд, написанный вполне литературно. Пропагандируется беспредельная мощь разума и духа человеческого» ("An original etude, written entirely literarily. It propagandizes the infinite power of man's reason and spirit"). (Platonov, Sochineniia , vol. 1, book 1, 574.) 25 Ibid., 144.</page><page sequence="17">146 Robert Hödel clearly identified either with that of the narrator or with that of the child. The result is a confluence of two worlds - that of the observing adult and that of the experiencing child. As is typical with Platonov, we hear this tone of voice already in the first sentences: Серая степная корова черкасской породы жила одна в сарае. Этот сарай, сделанный из выкрашенных снаружи досок, стоял на маленьком дворе путевого железнодорожного сторожа. В сарае, рядом с дровами, сеном, просяной соломой и отжившими свой век домашними вещами - сундуком без крышки, прогоревшей самоварной трубой, одежной ветошью, стулом без ножек, - было место для ночлега коровы и для ее жизни в долгие зимы. Днем и вечером к ней в гости приходил мальчик.26 The gray steppe cow of Cherkassian breed lived alone in the barn. This barn, made from wood planks painted on the outside, stood in a small courtyard belonging to the guard of railroad depot. In the barn, beside the firewood, the hay, the millet straw, and household items that had outlived their time - a chest without a lid, a samovar pipe that had burned through, ragged clothing, a legless chair - was the place for the cow's nighttime rest and life through the long winters. During the day and in the evening a boy came to visit her. The first paragraph shows some tension between a superior and well- controlled use of normative language, expressed mostly in the complex syntax, and a peculiar humanization of the cow, which «жила одна» ("lived alone") and had a place «для ночлега и для ее жизни» ("for nighttime rest and life"). Peculiar, because unlike the anthropomorphic phrase "household items that had outlived their time" («отжившими свой век домашними вещами»), at this time Platonov would not yet use the "humanization" of the cow as a rhetorical device - nor, at this time, would he ascribe it to the consciousness of a character. It seems as if the narrator himself tries to blur the distinctions between human and animal. The boy, who instigates this different perspective, is mentioned for the first time in the opening of the second paragraph. (Later, he says to the cow: «Ты не скучай, твой сын выздоровеет, его нынче отец назад приведет», or "Don't be lonesome, your son will get better. Father will bring him back now.") Despite all this, however, we remain under the impression that there is an intimate connection between the author and 26 Л. Platonov, Sóbrame sochinenïi v trekh tomakh (Moscow: Sovetskaia Rossiia, 1 984- 5), vol. 3, 241.</page><page sequence="18">The Development of Platonov's Narrative Perspective 1 47 the boy, and that the author is not simply being "infected" by the speech and the thoughts of the boy. The short story "Epifanskie shliuzy" ("The Sluices of Epiphany," 1926) reveals a structure similar to that of "Markun." Here too, the objective, down-to-earth literary style establishes a background against which the subjective elements of the narrative are generally attached to character consciousness. In contrast to "Markun," however, "Epifanskie shliuzy" already shows passages that seem to risk falling out of the system of "authorial narrative-free indirect discourse," e.g., passages such as: «Стихия горя свирепела в нем и запечатлевалась как попало и без всякого надзора со стороны разума» ("The element of grief grew fierce in him and was registered every which way and without any supervision on the part of reason")27. The complicated formulation "without any supervision on the part of reason" («без надзора со стороны разума»), which borrows the vocabulary of official language, could not be explained as free indirect discourse (of Perri). Rather, we have a case of a polemic separation of the narrator from his intellectually challenged character. The same separation becomes clear also in the quotation below. In that quotation, the phrase "disobeying reason" {ne slushaias' ra^uma), in which reason is personified even more clearly, has little connection to language norms (cf. the normative expressions "without listening to reason/«? prislushivaias' к га^ити" "without hearing the voice of reason/«? slysha golosa ra^uma" and we must "listen to our parents / slushat'sia rottele?*): [Завернувшись в одеяло] Бертран дремал, и тонкая живая печаль, не переставая, не слушаясь разума, струилась по всему его сухому сильному телу.28 [Having wrapped himself in the blanket,] Bertran slumbered, and a delicate living melancholy, ceaseless and disobeying reason, coursed all through his wizened, powerful body. However, since the authorial (neutral) narrative style is predominant, these confusions do not lead to the undermining of the narrator's position. Such expressions, typical of Platonov's mature prose fiction, are to be found already in short stories of the early period, but their character here is even more clearly "awkward." In "Volchok" (1920), for example, we read about the eponymous dog: «Он, как и я, ничего не мог понять и 27 Platonov, Sobrante sochinennii, vol. 1, 245. 28 Ibid., 226.</page><page sequence="19">148 Robert Hödel не мог отдохнуть от думы и жизни» ("Не, just like me, could not understand anything and could not rest from thought and hfe").29 The narrative oscillates between the language world of the narrating I, characterized by features of rhythmical prose, and the language world of the narrated I, for we want to ascribe the phrase in italics to the little boy as well. Unlike the case with "Korova," however, where the two worlds have merged and become indistinguishable, the consequence here is that there are some discrepancies. While one tends to ascribe formulations such as «Он [кобель] жил и думал, как и все люди» ("Не [the dog] lived and thought, just like all people")30 or «дождаться первой собачьей свадьбы» ("to wait until the first dog wedding")31 to the consciousness of the little boy, the following clever thought is inconsistent with the imagination of a child32: А я сказал: - Да, а жить-то как же? А узнавать есть чего, хоть бы то, отчего мы хотим знать все, если и узнавать нечего, все живет само собой в черноте и пустоте.33 And I said: "How do we live then? There is plenty to know, at the very least: why it is that we want to know everything, when there is nothing to know and everything lives on its own in darkness and emptiness." Such discrepancies shape the entire text and inevitably affect the phrase "of thinking and life" («от думы и жизни»). 2.4 Socialist Realist Prose In contrast to realist prose, socialist realist prose is distinguished by the primacy of the ideological over the psychological, as we see already in Gorky's Mať {Mother , 1906). On the level of the narrative, this primacy is matched by the predominance of authorial speech in normative literary language. In its turn, this predominance sets some constraints to 29 Platonov, Sochineniia , vol. 1, book 1, 151. 30 Ibid., 150. 31 Ibid., 152. )2 Cf. Subbotin's review in Gosizdat from March 1921: «Слишком серьезные вопросы для мальчика. Пессизмизм, болезненность, какой-то надрыв, который чувствуется и в друг&lt;их&gt; произведениях автора» ("Too serious questions for a boy. The pessimism, the morbidity, the break of some kind that is felt in other works by the author"). (Ibid., 575.) 33 Ibid., 151.</page><page sequence="20">The Development of Platonov's Narrative Perspective 1 49 character speech too, in accordance with the ideological primacy. Well- developed alien speech is possible only in so far as it matches the preferred ideology. The same applies to free indirect speech (and/or the internal monologue). In the mid-1 920s, Furmanov and Fadeev, among others, became known as representatives of the new ideological prose with their novels Chapaev (1923) and Ra^grom ( The Rout, 1926), works that would eventually be seen as forerunners of socialist realism. The topics of many of Platonov's short stories written in 1926-1927 are very close to those found in the emerging literature of socialist realism: e.g., the topics of electrification in "Rasskaz o potukhshei lampe Il'icha" ("The Story of Il'ich's Extinguished Lamp," 1926), of irrigation in "Peshchanaia uchitel'nitsa" ("The Sand Teacher," 1926), and of the Civil War in "Ivan Zhokh" (1927). The fundamental narrative of these short stories is also oriented toward normative literary language. Nevertheless, the categorization of these short stories as "proto-socialist realist" is questionable. Platonov's short stories of this period are too fantastic, too bold in their composition, or too metaphorical in their language. Most of all, they are neither unambiguous nor politically correct in their ideological statements. In "Rasskaz о potukhshei lampe Il'icha," the narrator stands firmly on the side of the proletarian artel, yet the story ends with a disaster when the power plant ( elektrostantsiià ) is destroyed. The eponymous "sand teacher" agrees to go work in a nomadic village not because she believes in a settled life ( osedlosť ), but because she believes that the view of the leader of the nomads is as legitimate as the view of progress she had previously been representing. This fact poses a question about the role of the Russians as a progressive nation in charge of "civilizing" others. Again, in "Ivan Zhokh," the "power of the class" ( klassovaia siici) is not enough for the narrator to kill an enthusiastic follower of Denikin. In this way, the right to use violence as a means for the establishment of a communist society is rejected - or at least questioned. In "Epifanskie shliuzy," Platonov also discusses fundamental doubts about centralist projects. In the scene in prison, when the failure Perri contemplates the stars, "this living fire in the sky, that burns wildly in the vault of heaven" («этому живому огню на небе, горевшему в своей высоте и беззаконии»34), Platonov suggests an "epiphany" of the impossibility of creating a rationally organized (communist) world. Even in "Gorod Gradov" ("The City Gradov"), where Platonov may really be inspired by the official critique of bureaucracy, the overwhelmingly grotesque and negative image of the country pushes the 34 Platonov, Sobranie sochinen'ti , 250.</page><page sequence="21">1 50 Robert Hödel idea of the construction of communism very far back. In "Antiseksus" too, the entire attitude of the text shows defeatist traits. It is important, however, that Platonov begins developing his mature poetics precisely in those short stories where he conducts a polemical discussion with certain ideological conceptions that, as we know, to a large extent represent his own former views. The speech of the District Chair in "Rasskaz o potukhshei lampe IPicha" recalls, for example, the thought process related to the chair Chepurnyi in Chevengur. Умно говорит предуика: лампа Ильича сейчас, говорит, вспыхнет и будет светить советскому селу века, как вечная память о великом вожде. Мотор, говорит, есть смычка города с деревней: чем больше металла в деревне, тем больше в ней социализма.35 Preduika [chairman of the district Party committee] has got sense: Lenin's lamp, he says, will blaze up now and shine for the Soviet village for centuries to come, as an eternal memorial for the great leader. The engine, he says, is the coupling of the city and village: the more metal in the village, the more it's got socialism. In "Gorod Gradov," specific expressions of the sort that we can see in Platonov's mature prose fiction are to be found particularly frequently in the context of the main protagonist Shmakov. As a "builder of the coming clearly developed socialist society" («зодчий грядущего членораздельного социалистического общества»),36 Shmakov fights, among other things, a fight against nature itself: "What about establishing a judicial power for nature and punishing it for its outage ?" («А что, если учредить для природы судебную власть и карать ее за бесчинствоЪ&gt;)Ъ1 Certainly, in all these short stories of the mature period, there is still a clear distinction from Chevengur. The predominant narrative orientation is authorial. In other words, the first signs of "tongue-tied" ( kosnoia^ychji ) speech are still perceived as deviations of a traditional normative consciousness from an unconditionally valid normative literary language. The same could also be said about the short story "Gorod Gradov." Even though Shmakov shows traits of those characters in Platonov who strive for a new society, the tone of voice discussing him is polemic. This polemic tone of voice defines even the passages in which the narrator becomes trapped in the speaking style of a selfless bureaucrat. The j5 Platonov, Sochineniia , vol. 1 , book 1 , 56. 36 A. Platonov, Vyskanie poojbshikh (Moscow: Shkola-press, 1995), 90. 37 Ibid., 78.</page><page sequence="22">The Development of Platonov's Narrative Perspective 151 narrator of "Gorod Gradov" does not speak as someone who has been subjected to the "language of the epoch." He speaks in a polemic spirit The preceding analysis of Platonov's early prose fiction leads to the following conclusions. First, early on in his career Platonov experimented with several of the different narrative techniques that were being practiced in the literary environment around him. In his early stylistic experiments from this period, a fundamentally "hierarchical perspective" is present. In other words, deviations from the norm of literary language neither undermine the authority of the narrator nor lead to a collapsed hierarchy. Second, in some of Platonov's early short stories there are linguistic expressions that are typical of Chevengur and other works from the mature period. In essence, then, all the Platonovisms of the mature fiction have their structural precedents in the earlier texts. The effect of these "predecessors" in the earlier texts, however, is quite different from those of the mature Platonovisms. Indeed, in many instances the early Platonovisms seem simply to be marks of stylistic roughness. When they are not just such marks, they signify either the artistic skill of the author or the character's distinct world of thought and language (as in the use of folkloristic or polemical mannerism). After 1926, the use of Platonovisms with a polemic character gradually increases. This is also the time when we begin to see the first uncertainties of narrative speech that will become typical for Platonov's mature fiction. We can only speak of a mature style, however, when we discuss Chevengur and the short stories written contemporaneously with it. From the manuscript of "Stroiteli strany," we can see that originally even the novel Chevengur was (at least partly) based on "traditional" narrative forms, traces of which we can recognize even in the final version. This becomes particularly obvious in the episode "Novokhopersk," told mostly in a realist manner, as well as in the dialogues between Serbinov and Sonia Mandrova in Moscow, which contrast sharply with the generally brief and awkward character speech in Chevengur. Comparison with the manuscripts so far published supports the assumption that Platonov developed his narrative style primarily in the process of working on the novel Chevengur. If this is true, aligning parts of the novel that were written in different styles or in different years could be seen as an important precondition. (Should we begin to relate the literary engineering and emphasis on montage in "Fabrika literatury" ["The Factory of Literature"] even more certainly to Platonov himself than we used to?) Undoubtedly, we should also consider the short story "Sokrovennyi chelovek" ("The Innermost Man") in the context of this hypothesis. Zamoshkin has been quoted as saying that he read this story in 1926, at</page><page sequence="23">152 Robert Hödel the same time he was reading Chevengur :38 Natalia Kornienko, however, dates the short story to 1927, on the basis that Platonov began writing "Stroiteli strany" immediately after "Sokrovennyi chelovek." Regardless of how "Stroiteli strany" is eventually dated, this preliminary text makes us realize that its later revised version led to a consolidation of the typical Platonov style. For "Sokrovennyi chelovek" already discusses a number of doubts and desires known to us from Chevengur or even later works. The protagonist Pukhov is inspired, for example, by the selflessness of the Red Army soldiers in the same way as Aleksandr Dvanov is inspired by the enthusiasm of the knight of the revolution, Kopenkin. In fact, Pukhov has some doubts about whether the Internationale would be able to replace the sense of a homeland, since the "homeland is a matter of the heart" («родина - сердечное дело»).39 He also wonders whether the fight against religion isn't useless: "not because Pukhov was a devotee, but because people had become accustomed to lodging their hearts in religion, and in the revolution they didn't find such a place" («не потому что Пухов был богомольцем, а потому, что в религию люди сердце помещать привыкли, а в революции такого места не нашли»).40 Не even fears the restoration of the old conditions: Но с Пухова взяли подписку - пройти вечерние курсы политграмоты. Пухов подписался, хотя не верил в организацию мысли. Он так и сказал на ячейке: человек - сволочь, ты его хочешь от бывшего бога отучить, а он тебе Собор Революции построит!41 But Pukhov had to give a pledge to sit through the evening lectures in political knowledge. Pukhov signed the pledge, even though he did not believe in the organization of thought. And he said as much at the chapter meeting: man is scum, you want to wean him off the old god, and he will build you a Cathedral of the Revolution! Here, the anxious Pukhov helps establish the basis for a tonality in which language anomalies will no longer lead to the distinction of a particular character. Pukhov, like Dvanov, travels through the country with "an open heart" and eventually abandons his starving country to wake up in Baku on one "completely revolutionary" («вполне революционное») morning.42 Thus we can conclude that, along with Chevengur , "Sokrovennyi chelovek" belongs to Platonov's "mature" prose fiction. 38 Shubina, "Vstupiternaia staťia i primechaniia," 215. y) A.

Non-formal Conditions in the Reception of Platonov's Narrative If we believe that the tonality of "Sokrovennyi chelovek" depends on the searching and worrying Pukhov , then it seems that the narrative style is dependent on semantic conditions. The term Platonovism already ties a linguistic method to a ideological element. Since precisely this teleological element is to be found in Platonov's very first articles, we must ask: what really changes between the mid- 1920s and the era of Platonov's mature work? What shaped the formation of the predecessors of Platonovisms in the earlier texts, in which they were not perceived as Platonovisms? On the basis of the voluminous secondary literature we could argue that there are different factors that brought about changes in these conditions. Scholars agree about the fact that in addition to a satirical orientation, Chevengur also shows Utopian dimensions, even if they interpret those dimensions quite differently: as a desire for the creation of a world proletariat, of an anarchist or post-religious communitas, of a sectarian community, or of a Fedorovian sobornosť (collectivity). The general scholarly consensus is that the desired world is in conflict with the Bolshevik regime being established in the second half of the 1 920s. It was most particularly Platonov who started criticizing the restitution of power (cf. the essay "Dusha cheloveka - neprilichnoe zhivotnoe," 1921). Thus one can assume that Platonov's experience as an electrotechnician significantly shaped the character of his critique. At the same time, it is important to recognize that Platonov fights against bureaucracy, nepotism, and ignorance not only as a "builder of the country" ( strvitel' strany), but also as a writer who, however, can publish only occasional marginal texts. (We should also remember that Platonov's financial troubles put great pressure on his relationship with Mar'ia Aleksandrovna, who blamed him in this period for not being able to properly support his family.43) Most importantly, however, the texts of the second half of the 1920s show that Platonov's own convictions were becoming more and more uncertain. As we see already from the doubts Pukhov has, this fact concerns not only the restitution of old power structures but also his relation to the "inner enemy." In addition, Platonov's early journalism betrays an almost unvanquished militant attitude toward the ideological opponent. Titles such as "Poslednii vrag" ("The Last Enemy"), "Razmozzhim" ("We Will 43 See "Pis'ma iz Tambova," in Arkhiv Platonova , ed. N. V. Kornienko, vol. 1 (Moscow: IMLI RAN, 2009), 443-480.</page><page sequence="25">1 54 Robert Hödel Smash"), "Zhivaia ekhidna" ("The Living Viper"), "Mir na krasnom shtyke" ("The World on a Red Bayonet"), "Dva udara na udar" ("Two Blows for Every Blow"), and "Kulak s vostoka" ("The Kulak from the East") attest to that. From the very beginning, Platonov was conscious of the fact that "the old Adam" is to be defeated both in the proletarian and in himself. Consequently, there is even a shadow over the bright future in "Zhazhda nishchego" (1920): "This life of the hot point of consciousness was almost pure, almost complete, but not to the end. Because I was in it a Vestige" («Почти чистая, почти совершенная была эта жизнь горящей точки сознания, но не до конца. Потому что в ней был я - Пережиток»).44 From the beginning of the mid- 1920s on, Platonov starts taking this "old Adam" very seriously. As the short story "Epifanskie shliuzy" suggests, the rational plan of creating a communist society had been made without any consideration of the real circumstances. It is not only the broad masses of the peasantry who are violated in this story. Perri also loses his only beloved due to his lofty ambitions. This suggests that Platonov saw the model of a rational (communist) world order in a broader socio-historical and psychological context. This is why the ideological enemy, once anonymous, gains clearer and clearer human features here. As already mentioned, the first-person narrator in "Ivan Zhokh" is not able to kill Zhokh's great-grandson, who goes to General Denikin in order "to beat the Red Army" («драться с красными»).45 In her conversation with the leader of the nomads, whose flocks destroy the irrigated fields in the steppe, the "Sand Teacher" realizes that ultimately the nomads, not the Russians who have recently moved into their territory, have the right to the steppe pastures. When she talks about this in the district, inadvertently she thinks of "the shrewd leader of the nomads who was not to be compared with her chief' («об умном вожде кочевников, несравнимом с этим начальником).46 Platonov turns this kind of conciliatory thinking into the subject of his article "O liubvi" ("On Love," 1926). The essay is based on the dichotomies of knowledge- beauty {gnanie- krasota) and science- faith ( nauka-vera ). Instead of limitlessly propagating knowledge, however, he seeks a force that could reconcile the two poles: Люди хотят понять ту первичную силу, ту веселую буйную мать, из которой все течет и рождается, откуда вышла и где веселится сама эта чудесная жизнь бессмертная жизнь, откуда выросла эта маленькая веточка 44 Platonov, Sochineniia , vol. 1 , book 1 , 1 66. 45 Ibid., 41. 46 Ibid., 47.</page><page sequence="26">The Development of Platonov's Narrative Perspective 1 55 - религия, которая теперь засыхает, и на ее месте, на одном с ней стволе вырастает другой цветок - наука...47 People want to understand that primordial force, that joyous wild mother, from whom all flows and is born, from whom sprang this wonderful life immortal life and where it rejoices, from whom grew this little sprig - religion, which now is withering, and in its place, on the same trunk, a different flower is growing - science... It appears that this concept is formative for the novel Chevengur as well. The Dvanov group established because of the arrival of Aleksandr Dvanov in Chevengur, which is different from Chepurnyi's and Prokofli's militant group "First Chevengur," believes in the idea of a communist social order. However, the bourgeois "vestiges" (pereqèitkt ), including the greedy couple Prokofii and Klavdia, the intimate relationship of Kirei and the ironic Serbinov, are no longer excluded. It is as if a "primordial force" (perevichnaia sila) able to connect the "old Adam" {vetkhii Adam ) to communism has developed. At the same time, however, Aleksandr Dvanov is aware of the fact that this group cannot exist for long - neither at the given historical moment, nor in general. In this paradoxical rift between desiring an ideal and acknowledging reality, we can determine one non-formal condition of narrative perspective and its characteristic Platonovisms, a condition that relates to "content": Platonovisms are an expression of the only true world, which does not or cannot possibly exist any longer. Thus, while the author represents them without reservations, at the same time they are banished into a somnambulist symbolic space. Platonov holds fast to this paradox not only in Chevengur but also in other later works. It is the paradox of a belief in the "new man," who will be disavowed in the confrontation with reality. % -9 47 Platonov, Gosudarstvennyi %hitel' 650, ellipsis mine.</page></plain_text>
