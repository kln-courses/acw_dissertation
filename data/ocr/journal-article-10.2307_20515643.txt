<plain_text><page sequence="1">195 Scientific Humanism By Liam Brophy, Ph.B. IN the course of his address to mem bers of the Christian Renaissance Movement last January the Pope denounced those who would make of Catholicism a " mutilated anaemic, sweetened Faith." " Christianity," said His Holiness, " has been recently advised to adopt a scientific life, and to take up the extraordinary power of its technicalities in the light of which historic forms and ancient dog mas no longer burn as brightly as in the past." In the twilight of these post-war years millions are searching for a philosophy of life that will give them a scale of spiritual values and a sense of purpose to their lives. Catholicism they find demands too much effort and sacrifice. Humanism of the Paul Elmer More type is too vapid and vague for the masses, and demands a degree of culture and men tal discipline which their atrophied wills reject as Highbrow. But the persistent demand has created the supply according to the specifications of the demand, and the masses are therefore, offered a Scientific Humanism as the fulfilment of their yearnings for an ersatz religion. It is conspicuously true that Scien tific Humanism is a rendezvous where those who have abandoned Christianity and are on the way to agnosticism meet those who, lacking any religion, are on the way upwards towards a profession of faith, however dimly dis cerned from the slough of despond. It*,is thus a half-way house on the side of a hill on whose height is set the City of God and at whose base lie the treacherous marshes of Modern Thought. The older Humanists had said that mankind would come to see more and more that the salvation of mankind lay in poetry. Our later Humanists place it in science. Not long after he had walked out of the ecclesiastical seminary and cast off Catholicism with the clerical habit Renan wrote in "his preface to his L'Avenir de la Science : "It is no exaggeration to say that Science con tains the future of humanity, and that it alone can say the last word on human destiny and teach mankind how to reach its goal . . . Science is only valuable in so far as it can take the place of religion." Many of the declining Protestant sects are making desperate com promises to the more powerful cults of our time. They will clutch at any straw rather than grasp the Rock of</page><page sequence="2">196 THE IRISH MONTHLY Peter. Many are seeking an alliance with Communism, led by the exhor tations of the Dean of Canterbury. Others, galvanized into a semblance of spiritual vitality through contact with Modernism, look to Science as to a new revelation. Thus, the Rev. Dr. James Parkes writes in his book God and Human Progress : " It is not pos sible to exaggerate the significance of the discovery by men^-or the revela tion by God?of the scientific method, and all which has followed from it. It is to the New Age what the authority of the Bible was to the Age which is passing, no more and no less, and in religion as much as in any other field. It is a much more perfect vehicle for the revelaton of the nature and purposes of God than anything men have hitherto possessed." (The italics are the author's own). Protes tantism, which once believed so firmly in the sufficiency and infallibility of the Bible, now looks on it, in the works of Dr. Parkes, as a book which bases its authority on " the entrails of a sheep or the mystic utter ances of a neurotic." In an Age such as this of advanced thought and exalted theories " the Bible can only take its place as a priceless treasury of men's spiritual experiences." The prophets of the New Dispensation will be the physicists. The scientists will take the place of the saints. Doubtless the Divine Benediction that was wont to be showered on men as a gentle dew from heaven will be replaced by atomic-dust scattered over the earth from radar-directed planes. Auguste Comte was one of the major prophets of Scientific Humanism. According to Comte the great fundamental law of the develop ment of human intelligence lies in the mind's natural threefold method of reasoning. Our knowledge passes through three different theoretical conditions : the theological, or fictitious ; the metaphysical, or abstract ; and the scientific, or positive. Hence arise three philoso phies which exclude all others. The first is a necessary starting place for the human intelligence ; the second is a stage of transition, while the third is a fixed a blessed state of scientific cer tainty. In the theological state, said Comte, the human mind seeks the nature of things, the first and final causes of effects, supposing natural phenomena to be produced by super natural beings. In the second or metaphysical stage, the mind sub stitutes abstractions for supernatural beings. In the third, the positive stage, the mind abandons the search after absolute notions and concen trates, through reason and observa tion, on the laws that govern pheno mena. In the course of time science is to reduce all facts to a unified and coherent explanation of life. It will replace the old spiritual values by those of positive science. In place of</page><page sequence="3">SCIENTIFIC HUMANISM 197 the Heaven of the theologians and the Absolute of the metaphysicians it will establish a real ciel4ci-bas, a heaven here-below in the form of a planned scientific Utopia. In his Western Republic, published a century ago, Comte; set forth the glories of the scientific state and began the cult of Utopian fiction with the theological fervour of a mystic. The cult duly received its philosophic sanction and , form through Wells, and was scientifi cally satirised by Aldous Huxley in his Brave New World. What inspirations Wells derived from his science text-books, and how ingeniously he decked out his intellec tual wares for show ! How simply and persuasively he wove terms from biology and physics into the fabric of his scientific vision, and how he be came enraged at whatever barred the path to its realisation ! We know with what impotent hate he hurled himself against the Rock of Peter, and how he reviled the supreme Pon tiff. Recollecting Wells' own modern store of erudition, mercilessly exposed by Belloc, we are startled to find such phrases in his Crux Ansata as i( Even if the Pope had been free to read modern scientific literature in such scraps of time as were available for that purpose, he would still be a rela tively ignorant man." " The Pope, any Pope, is necessarily an ill-educated and foolish obstacle, a nucleus of base resistance, heir to the tradition of Roman Catholicism in its last stage of poisonous decay on the way to a better order in the world." That was published in 1943. In Mind at the End if its Tether, pub lished two years later, Wells said, among other remarkable things : "In Crux Ansata again, this present writer has let himself boil over freely and violently. Nevertheless it is dream stuff." Wells had discovered how baseless was the fabric of his vision, and there are passages in this last book of his, the testament of a Scientific Humanist, which give us furiously to think. " The end of everything we call life is close at hand and cannot be evaded " ; " The Pat tern of Things to Come (has) faded away " ; ' ' The attempt to trace a pattern of any sort is absolutely futile "; " Our doomed formicary is helpless as the implacable Antagonist kicks or tramples our world to pieces " ; "A series of events has forced upon the intelligent observer that realisation that the human story has already come to an end and that Homo Sapiens, as he has been pleased to call himself, is in his present form played out ". The Homo Sapiens of Wells, the Scientific Humanist towards which the whole three thousand mil lion years of Organic Evolution had tended, was indeed played out and hia formicary was trampled out, not by any Hardyesque Antagonist, but by the destructive and distressing factor</page><page sequence="4">198 THE IRISH MONTHLY omitted from all the formulae of scientific text-books?Original Sin. The efforts of the Scientific Humanists to replace Faith by fact did not alter human nature which remains as eager to make the same destructive use of science in our age as it made of stones in more primitive ages. Plus ?a change. It will hardly be denied that the blue prints of the Scientific Humanists still look extremely blue. There is none of the Virgilian verve in them about fresh beginnings?" Magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo "? nor any trace of Shelley's dream of a new dawn when " the world's great age begins anew, the golden years return." Aldous Huxley developed that blueness to the ultimate depths of indigo in his scathing Brave New World, written in the Wellsian man ner and with the Wellsian pseudo scientific approach. Huxley was well equipped to mock the dream of Scien tific Humanism, for he was a scientist by training and education and a humanist by inclination. (It is said that Julian was expected to be an author and Aldous a scientist.) Huxley shows a world ruled by precision and expediency, a world in which every thing works with mechanical exacti tude, leaving no room for poetry or prayer, no scope for the adventures of the spirit. It is the simultaneous and perfect possession of interminable boredom. Efficiency is the only god, symbolised by the mythical figure of Ford, and Sunday has come to be called Ford's Day. But at the core of this ordered world of science lie sterility, ennui and death. There is another sense in which Scientific Humanism might be regarded as a half-way house. It lies midway between the extremes of Humanism, as it is commonly under stood, and Communism, between the cult of More and the creed of Marx. In a comparison between the two, (published in The Irish Monthly, January 1947) it was observed that the Pelagian Man haunts both extremes. His uneasy spirit is also a permanent resident in the half-way house. " Man must and can work out his own sal vation without the help of Heaven " say the Scientific Humanists and quote much of Fitzgerald's version of Omar, such as : ? " And that inverted Bowl they call the sky, Whereunder crawling coop'd we live and die, lift not your hands to It for help ?for It As impotently moves as you or I." Instead of Divine Grace man is to achieve his salvation through the machine and the wider dissemination of scientific knowledge. In this fond belief the Scientific Humanists are in accord with the Marxists. " Ignor ance is the great misfortune of the</page><page sequence="5">SCIENTIFIC HUMANISM 199 world, its devil, and slavery is its hell. The machine is the redeemer who shall save man from this devil and hell." This remarkable dogma is to be found in a book entitled Com munism and Christianisme by the Rt. Rev. Montgomery Brown, D.D., for merly Episcopal Bishop of Arkansas, " now Episcopus in partibus Bolshe vikium et Infidelium ". The book tells how its author came to abandon the " Jesuine Gospel " for the more advanced one of Karl Marx. He demonstrates to his own apparent satisfaction how " the ten greatest teachers of the world " ousted God from the sky and from nature and from the mind of man by the evolu tion of scientific knowledge. The reverend author had not caught up with Freud, whose doctrine would have crowned ,his system and then would have ironically undermined it by proving all thought, including Dr. Brown's and Freud's, as of no value. The ten greatest teachers cited are Lavoisier, Mayer, Kant, Laplace, Kepler, Newton, Darwin, Wallace, Marx and Engels. It is ?o mere coincidence that these names figure prominently in the works of our Scien tific Humanists, though most of these scientists would be amazed to find to what base abuses their words and works had come. Doubtless their training gives Protestant Divines an amount of skill in adapting texts to the new Bible of Marxianism. Communism, like Scientific Human ism, is based on nineteenth century science. Here is a typical piece of Marxist literature, part of the official manifesto of the Socialist Party of Great Britain : " The concept of God, as the explanation of the Universe, is becoming entirely untenable in this age of scientific inquiry. The laws of the persistence of force and the inde structibility of matter, and the unend ing interplay of cause and effect, make the attempt to trace the origin of things to an anthropomorphic God, Who had no cause, as futile as is the Oriental cosmology which holds the world rests on an elephant, and as an afterthought, that the elephant stands on a tortoise . . . Socialism is the application of science, the arch-enemy of religion, to human relationships May we not comment, as an after thought, that Marxism is based on Materialism, and that the Materialism is based on Determinism which is going the way of all futilities. Scien tists such as Eddington, Jeans and Schr?dinger have declared that Deter minism has broken down and that the Principle of Indeterminacy has taken its place. Science has become more humble since the time when Tyndall declared in his Belfast address that the only reality is matter and motion, and that science would solve all human * Bradford-Brown Educational Co., Galion, Ohio, 1920.</page><page sequence="6">200 THE IRISH MONTHLY problems?including, as he implied, the need for deliverance from evil and the grace of a compassionate God. Mars inverted the Hegelian Idealism and now modern physics is returning to Idealism, inverting Marx, and dis crediting all the dogmas of the Scien tific Humanists whose Utopias are shown now to be indeed " the baseless fabric of a vision ".</page></plain_text>
