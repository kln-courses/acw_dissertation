<plain_text><page sequence="1"></page><page sequence="2">Place in Vertical Space The Rising Skyline in the Urban Environment and the of Place Jane Boyd Fine Artist How does building design pay due regard to the primacy of place within the urban context while attempting to satisfy the increasing demands of the client? In what ways has the engineer influenced the speed of change in design and architectural aesthetics in terms of construction materials? Where are the boundaries between place and space in the context of the ubiquitous monumental building and high-rise urban trophy architecture? The practice of architecture provides a unique arena for pooling expertise. The widening range of skills and professions that the archi tect was able to draw upon by the 1930s made the roles of the structural and mechanical engineer increasingly important. Architects and engineers now have a mandate to add to the urban skyline in ways which are environmentally sustainable, yet how does the nature of the designed space relate to that which is the by-product of a particular design? Broadly speaking, the essential materials of the construction industry have remained unaltered: timber, brick, concrete, iron and glass have been in use for centuries. However, to paraphrase Mies van der Rohe, change in architectural design comes about as a result of the way materials are used and not necessarily as a result of the introduction of new building material.1 Thus the explosion in the use of glass and iron in the nineteenth century occurred as a result of vastly increased efficiency in manufacturing processes caused by the Industrial Revolution and this effectuated the launch of constructions that were both light-weight and light-giving. There is evidence to suggest that early uses of concrete can be detected in the construction of the Egyptian Pyramids (Campbell and Folk 1991: 28, 30-39).The aggregate developed in Roman times bears little relation to contemporary aggregates first devel oped by John Smeaton which include Portland stone Etnofoor, Architecture, volume 23, issue 1,2011, pp. 144-170</page><page sequence="3">and lime.2 Nevertheless, the basic principle involved in making concrete remains the same and it is the most commonly used man-made material in the construc tion industry worldwide. Kilns have been firing bricks for more than three thousand years and although today they are used in a variety of ways, not just as a basic structural component, in Roman architecture from antiquity they were primarily used to face a concrete core.3 How does the evolution of building techniques affect the boundary between space and place in public urban spaces where buildings assume new uses and alter a sense of personal identity by the user? This article will explore these questions by examining particular key developments in design and construction that have arisen from certain seminal designs, inven tions and building techniques, and considering how they have become absorbed into the 'urban pyschoge ography' of the individual (Debord 2008). First, let us consider, by a couple of graphic examples, the vital role of communication in the construction industry. The story of the Tower of Babel has been power fully enshrined in works by wide-ranging artists where imaginations have been stimulated by an early biblical narrative. It demonstrates the immediate disaster of catastrophic proportions which occurs when commu nication breaks down. A mission to build a tower to reach the heavens in the heart of a new city in Shinar came tumbling to the ground when, by Divine inter vention, the construction team could no longer communicate. Let us review the biblical text to see how it was interpreted by the Netherlandish artist, Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Genesis 11. 4-8 4. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 5. And the Lord came down to see the city which the children of men builded. 6. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one and they have all one language; and this they begin to do; and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do. 7. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. 8. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.4 Figure 1. The Coliseum, Rome. Photograph from '1980 1900' by Peter Paul Mackey from the British School at Rome Digital Collection. 146</page><page sequence="4">In the early 1550s, Bruegel travelled to Rome and its outskirts. Unfortunately, of the drawings he made, only the Porta di Ripa Grande in Rome (1552-54) and the Prospectus Tyburtina (View ofTivoli) survive. However, it is highly likely that for his dramatic interpretations of the biblical narrative he used studies he made of the Coliseum (Orenstein 2001: 96-97). Of the three paintings of the Tower of Babel, two survive and these were made some ten years after his return from Italy, in the space of one year. It could be argued that these works are companion pieces. In one painting he expresses the expediency of a monolingual community, in the other he demonstrates the disastrous effect of a building team unable to communicate with one another as the tower crashes to the ground in vertical shards.5 In time-honored tradition, he uses the capacity of the visual image to interpret a biblical narrative which in turn is about the power of commu nication. A contemporary example of such a disaster occurred in May 1968 at Ronan Point, a prefabri cated concrete tower block in Newham East London, when, as a result of a small gas leak, a load-bearing wall reduced one entire corner of the twenty-two-storey Figure 2. Ronan Point 1968 showing collapse of one entire corner of the building. Photograph from Daily Telegraph 21, February 1968. building to rubble and caused the deaths of four people. In the UK, research began on progressive collapse; the United States followed and soon implemented new design criteria (Fuller 1975). The lessons from Ronan Point would change building regulations throughout the world (Wearne 1999). The structural engineer as revolutionary Publius Aelius Hadrianus (76-138 AD) 'There is no other monument that for so many centu ries has influenced the architecture of the whole world' (in Vighi 1957: 18). Artists, architects and engineers alike continue to marvel at the extraordinary concrete structure that is the Pantheon. Some commentators assert that it has influenced buildings as far-flung as Figure 3. The Pantheon at 7.00 am. Photograph by Jane Boyd, 2007. 147</page><page sequence="5">the State Library of Victoria 1856, Australia, designed by Joseph Reed (1823-1890) and Norman Foster's extension to the British Museum 2000, London, while the 'father and master of all arts'Michelangelo Buonar roti (1475-1564) declared that the Pantheon was a building designed by angels (Boyd 2008). In his concept for the Pantheon, Hadrian stated that 'this sanctuary of All Gods should reproduce the likeness of the terrestrial globe and of the stellar sphere... the disk of daylight would rest suspended there like a shield of gold; rain would form its clear pool on the pavement below, prayers would rise like smoke toward that void where we place the gods' (in Vighi 1957: 18). The pertinence of this statement would become apparent in 1999 when this author had the unique opportunity to make Chancing the Circle, a light-based installation in the centre of the Pantheon.6 The building exists as a geometric narrative on the circle within the square. Whether the building is considered on plan or elevation, the play on circle within square is implicit if not explicit. To stand alone in the very centre of the floor is to touch the inside of the lower hemisphere and become a part of the geometry of a perfect circle (Boyd 2008). Figure 4. Floor plan of The Pantheon. From Dehio and Von Bezold (1884). Figure 5. The Pantheon Rome with the addition of bell towers designed by Gianlorenzo Bernini. Photograph from the Thomas Ashby Collection, The British School at Rome Digital Collections. Through the lens of the camera in the early 1900s, it is possible to see and to get a feel of how the building was augmented and enhanced to reflect architectural trends and events of national importance as they occurred over the last two centuries.' One of the most significant changes was the addition of a pair of bell towers by Gianlorenzo Bernini in the seventeenth century. This extraordinary augmentation acquired the epithet 'asses' ears' by the people of Rome yet the two bell towers survived another two hundred years until under Pope Leo XIII in 1883 they were duly removed. The diameter of the rotunda is equal to that of its height, 43 metres (142ft), and the diameter of the occulus is 8.7 metres (29ft). The purpose of this space was to suggest geometrical perfection and symmetry in the context of a perfect universe. Yet, in structural 148</page><page sequence="6">terms, what makes this building unique is a) the fact that its dome is a circular rotunda and b) that this dome is made of solid concrete. How does a dome of this size bear its own weight in concrete? Is there a relationship between the Great Eye and the human eye in terms of the function of light and the ability to see visually and spiritually? In what sense can the Great Eye be compared to the Evil Eye of antiquity? Is it the inter vention of Pope Boniface and his consecration of the Pantheon as a church, Chiesa Santa Maria dei Martin, in 609 AD that has saved this unique building from joining the ruins of so many buildings from antiquity that make up Rome today? The Temple was the tallest structure for miles around. The original layout of Campus Martius demonstrates a grand architectural prelude to the Pantheon with long vistas surrounding the Temple so that the experience of the interior could be anticipated from far away. It is illuminated solely by the passage of natural light through the oculus or aperture in the centre of the domed roof of concrete. The interior is brought to life by one uninterrupted beam of light; there is a tangible sense of being outside as opposed to inside. The special quality in the relationship between the interior and the directness of the source of light by which it is experienced belie the fact that the building has been standing for nearly two thousand years. The coffering is both functional and decorative having been once covered in sheets of gilded bronze. The eye is drawn to the concrete dome and down onto the porphyry floor and this induces a precarious state of orientation and disorientation within this giant enclo sure, challenging the boundaries between sculpture and architecture. Figure 6. The dome with oculus at the Pantheon in Rome. Photograph by Jane Boyd, 2007. In his comprehensive study, Mark Wilson-Jones sets out a description of the specific types of aggregates used in the construction of the Pantheon whereby, at the base, travertine marble is a substantial part of the mix, while near the oculus where the aggregate has to be relatively thin and light it is largely composed of volcanic ash coming from Pozzuoli (Wilson-Jones 2000). Evidently the level of experimentation with the versatility of concrete in Roman architecture was considerably advanced and it is tantalizing to speculate on the variety of aggregates used across the Roman Empire and whether the size of dome at the Pantheon was superseded by another concrete building at any stage. For now, the Pantheon remains unique in having the largest circular dome of unreinforced concrete in the world. The dome designed by Filippo Brunelleschi in 1436 for the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore in 149</page><page sequence="7">Figure 7. The Pantheon at 9.30pm in the Piazza Rotunda. Photograph by Jane Boyd, 2007. Florence is two meters wider and one of the most impressive works of the Renaissance period, although it features the more familiar octagonal dome. If Las Meninas (Diego Velazquez, 1656) is a painting about painting then the Pantheon is surely a design about design. Today, the Pantheon is dwarfed by apartment blocks and wedged between slices of pizza in the tourist's itin erary. The building breathes crowds - inhaling and exhaling people from all over the world. Then at night, as if exhausted by theses masses who fill the space, it shuts down and becomes the backdrop for the ever changing theatre in the Piazza della Rotunda. The approach routes to the Pantheon are many and narrow offering glimpses of the ancient structure in the negative space between the relatively modern buildings flanking the streets. The streets give way, sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly, to the spaciousness of the piazza, an area which has acquired a profound sense of place entirely because of the existence of the Pantheon and its ability to inspire. Over time, this piazza has acquired meaning and a complex set of alluring sensations. Two thousand years ago, the Romans added the invention of concrete to the range of viable building materials. The construction of the Pantheon in concrete set a benchmark which would have a radical impact on the nature of the built environment for centuries to come. Nicolas Esquillan (1902-89) If it had been possible I would have evoked Nicolas Esquillan one of the greatest French engineers of the 20th century, respected worldwide, including by Frans Leonhardt who admired him for his works and also for his modesty and personal character (Virlogeux 2007: 23). Contemporary concrete has an aggregate which is generally composed of Portland Stone and lime. Its composition has altered little since John Smeaton pioneered the use of hydraulic lime and the submersion of the cement in water in 1756.8 Where concrete is used as a primary building material today it is almost always reinforced and reinforced concrete provides a quick, cheap (though sometimes unreliable) adaptable building material for massive urban constructions. The ubiquitous use of reinforced concrete has brought about a new order for urban life which in many cities depends upon uses of space above and below ground level.9 The French engineer Nicolas Esquillan is chiefly remem bered for his pioneering contribution to the design of 150</page><page sequence="8">Figure 8. CNIT Building Paris designed by Nicolas Esquil lan, 1958. Photograph by Jane Boyd, 2006. the Centre Nationale des Industries et Technologies in Paris, more commonly referred to as the CNIT Building. More than half a century ago, Esquillan set about studying the geometric principles found in the eggshell and seashells to calculate the feasibility of constructing a building that consists in a colossal roof without walls. The result was his remarkable design for a roof or dome of striking proportions: it remains the largest single span of reinforced concrete - at least in Europe if not the world. The original design team included architects Robert Camelot and Bernard Zherfuss and the CNIT Building was completed in 1958 on a site at La Defense almost adjacent to the Grande Arche whose construction was completed nearly thirty years later in 1986. The Grande Arche has been strategically sited on the same axis as lArc de Triomphe which, although four kilometers away, is clearly visible from the steps of the Arche. This extraordinary construction for which Esquillan was so responsible functions today as a conference and exhibi tion centre and includes shops and restaurants. Recent refurbishments and expansion now take the visitor by escalator to a subterranean level where there is a corridor of shops and a monument to its structural engineer. To the visitor, La Defense has the presence of an architect's show room, an open-air museum of contemporary architecture. There is no traffic; instead the walkways of generous proportions allow the visitor, as if in a giant sculpture park, to feel their physical stature diminish as they engage with each building. People naturally gather at the steps leading to La Grande Arche and look through the vast window from Figure 9. CNIT Building Paris designed by Nicholas Esquillan; apex of the roof 46 meters above ground level. Photograph by Jane Boyd, 2006. 151</page><page sequence="9">both directions out towards the skyline. As it hovers just above the ground like a robust ribbed crustacean whose shell has been bleached by the sun, the CNIT Building appears experimental and too fantastic for its years. Inside, the roof is of concrete brutale, ribbed in three sections which fan out from the apex like ripples on water. It is an uncompromising and profound spatial state ment whose interior is not sympathetic to fixed divi sions and interior design. In this regard, the original concept is certainly fit for purpose - as an adaptable conference centre accommodating large numbers people. Architecture and evolution of vertical space - stairway and lift The Spiral Staircase When considering the evolution of internal vertical space and how it is navigated by the individual, it is perhaps useful to consider the history of the use of the spiral stairway as a strategic aid to defense in the medi eval period.10 The ruins of a castle built in 1253, on top of a hill in Najac, southern France, include four turrets and when ascending each stone stairway, one quickly becomes aware of the importance of such features in overcoming the enemy. The spiral staircase winds upwards in a clockwise direction; window slits of up to 6.8 meters high, in the case of Najac, once allowed for up to three arrows to be shot simultaneously. Now the spiral staircase is no longer bound to wind clockwise in order to compromise movement of the (generally) right-handed enemy swordsman. It is put to work in a variety of ways - from a stand-alone, yet functional, architectural feature in an atrium to the design concept for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1956. The open spiral is integral to the design of this gallery space which gradually rises over several floors to create a cylinder of three-dimen sional space. It is a striking low-rise addition to the Manhattan skyline. By the end of the fifteenth century, it is as if the functionality of the medieval spiral staircase has evolved into a curvilinear form that maintained a certain poetic balance between sculpture and architecture. It recalls the drawings by Leonardo da Vinci of eddies and swirls which eloquently express the presence of clockwise and anti-clockwise behavior of natural phenomena. Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 in the small town of Amboise, home to the French royal court. It is perhaps Figure 10. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum New York designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1937; view from 5th Avenue. Photograph by Finlay McWalter, 2004. 152</page><page sequence="10">Figure 11. The Vatican Museums, Rome, and the double helix spiral staircase designed by Giuseppe Momo, 1932. Photograph by Norman B., Wiki Commons. significant that during his later life, Leonardo was befriended by King Francois 1 for in the year of Leon ardo's death the king would begin work nearby on the Chateau de Chambord. This is the largest chateau in France and it features a closed spiral staircase with a double helix. It is tempting to consider that Leonardo's relationship with the king and their exchange of ideas might have had a bearing on the notion and feasibility of the design for this spiral staircase. The open double helix spiral staircase at the Vatican Museums, the Helicoidal Ramp designed by Giuseppe Momo in 1932, has become perhaps the most photo graphed and thus the most recognizable spiral stairway in the Western world. Its wide treads allow for, and signal its purpose to convey, large numbers of people through vertical space. Curiously, in December 2010 this monumental struc ture became the unlikely host to an exhibition of miniatures, The Way of the Sea. The Ramp induces a captivating sensation of space and motion and it is of questionable merit, for either the individual or the exhibits, to ambush the experience of this truly fasci nating structure in order to capitalize on the stop move-stop rhythm of the visitor's footfall. The visitor engages with the vertical space created by the Ramp by moving through the space on the ascent and decent while others simultaneously share in this same pattern of oscillation through space. Perspectives shift rapidly - what was small becomes large and vice versa. When attempts are made photographically to document this experience the results, however impressive, flatten the double helix and reduce it to a two-dimensional spiral of distorted proportions. The experience of vertical space and its beguiling sense of vortex resists documen tation since this is a function of movement through and individual perception of that space. The spiral staircase uses the principle of the helix and double helix found in many common organic forms visible to the human eye. The construction industry depends entirely on the helix, as a vital surface detail such as that found in the thread to a bolt, screw or drill bit, and in coils of steel, copper and cable. At the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, the architect 153</page><page sequence="11">Figure 12. Heal's and Son Ltd London opened in 1840. Photograph by Jane Boyd, 2001. Ken Woolley slots a spiral staircase through a ceiling to below ground level. It travels a vertical space of 6.8 metres between two equally high walls as if to parody the thread on a drill bit. It calls to mind the work of his contemporary, Pop art Claes Oldenburg and the self portrait of the recumbent artist next one of his Giant Toothpaste Tube sculptures.11 Figure 13. Dickens and Jones London, 1835-2007. Pho tograph by Jane Boyd, 2001. By the early 1900s the movement for women's suffrage in the UK had yet to achieve the right to vote and equal pay: the social and economic position was deeply frustrating and led to direct action in the form of continual protests and demonstrations. Meanwhile, in the male dominated retail industry, even by the mid nineteenth century, it was deemed suitable for a middle 154</page><page sequence="12">class woman, provided she was in the company of a chaperone, publicly to make her own purchases. This brought about the launch of the department store, Bainbridge in Newcastle, Northern England in 1838, swiftly followed by Le Bon Marche in Paris a few months later.12 By the end of the Industrial Revolution radical change had occurred in the retail industry that would affect trade world wide. As development of the retail experience gathered pace the demands on design, display and facilities called for a new creative approach in order to provide an environment where the customer was encouraged to remain all day happily using the store as a social and purchasing facility. Fortunately for the uk, the retail industry did not have to wait until women got the vote in 1928, before it was socially acceptable for women of all classes publicly to go shopping. The retailer wanted customers and potential customers. Here was a new pretext to invest in good architecture, excellent spatial design and user-friendly interior fittings. This gave a fresh opportunity for the spiral staircase to make a grand entrance in designs chiefly concerned with communicating to the shopper an environment of luxury, ease, indulgence, spatial openness and safety. Use of the atrium in department stores such as Dickens and Jones which opened in London in 1835 and le grand magazin, les Galleries Lafayette in Paris, enhances the feel of spatial openness; it encourages the opportunity for the space and its contents to be antici pated through the void from galleries at every level. It was in 1893, that the retailer Theophile Bader estab lished les Galleries Lafayette and upon its expansion Bader commissioned a sumptuous new design and layout from Georges Chedanne (1861-1940) in 1907. Appropriating from the design of contemporary theat rical auditoria, the store included plans for the galleried floor areas around the atrium which still present the irresistible invitation to look over the balustrade and engage with the space. The atrium, capped with a magnificent copula of steel, is richly detailed with poly chromatic stained glass; it was designed and completed during 1910-1912 by Ferdinand Chanut. Modern staircases gave additional access to floors otherwise served by elegant wrought iron lifts. The completion of the building made a huge and most remarkable contri bution to design and the decorative arts of the Art Nouveau period. The first department stores heralded the arrival of the underground passenger train, a much needed addition to the range of transport systems that shoppers, commuters and ordinary individuals would use throughout the day. The geology of London required engineers to provide a network of surface-level and deep-level tracks for the London Underground. The first lines opened in 1863 and subsequently, in 1890, the first part of the deep-level Great Northern Line, now known as the Northern Line, was completed. The requirements for this line included tunneling the ground at a depth of 58.5 meters in order to provide Hampstead with a station.13 Not surprisingly, this station has a lift shaft of 55 meters deep, not matched anywhere on the Underground system, and an emer gency spiral staircase of over 320 steps. How many users of the Underground are conscious of the depth at which they are travelling and its relation to the built environment overhead? Today, around fourteen thousand people use 'Hampstead Tube' each day and of those some will regret having chosen to take the stairs 155</page><page sequence="13">instead of the lift! The spiral staircase is a common feature of the London Underground. These staircases are closed spirals situated against a wall which is usually tiled and completely uniform; the treads are wide but not deep yet there is little visible spatial information to give an indication of the vertical distance travelled and thus to inform spatial perception. Here, an unusual experience of vertical space occurs as the user cannot see further than the curve allows. Lifts A system of vertical transportation had been imagined in terms of 'rising cupboards', an ascending room' and as a 'moveable room' and each of these descriptions illustrate the way inventors were thinking and planning in the early 1800s (Goodwin 2001: 43). The fascina tion was clearly about being able to rise up or to elevate oneself through space. Others remarked that it was not possible 'elevate' down through space although it was possible to 'lift'up and down. Hence we have two terms in circulation. The notion of vertical transport became not only a reality by 1850 but with Elisha Otis's design, it established a safe way of moving cargo and people through space. Consequently, the arrival of the safety lift signalled a new era for architecture, for engineering and for the enjoyment of people using the urban environment. The skyscraper began dramatically to raise the skyline. Subsequently, photography and film-making within the urban context underwent a renaissance with film makers Rene Clair (Paris qui Dort 1925) and Alfred Hitchcock (Blackmail 1929) being surely among the first to exploit unfamiliar breath-taking perspectives made possible by vertical transport systems (Boyd 2008: 266). Now largely taken for granted, the lift is nevertheless a considerable feat of engineering and has acquired its own mythologies perhaps because it is an enclosed space in which the user is effectively trapped with or without other people while in vertical motion. A new dimension to this experience, recalling the birdcage cabin design of the 1880s, is the lift as a rectangular glass box installed in the skin of a design. This type of cabin avoids the claustrophobia of the conventional lift and gives the passenger a thrilling visual escape into the changing perspectives of the city while they move through space. The first passenger lifts to arrive in London travelled by ship in 1885; three years later Otis Brothers and Co were shipping 'eleva tors to China and South America'(Goodwin 2001:67). For the first time, the World Fair 1889 in Paris presented Otis with the awesome challenge of providing a lift which needed to rise to a height of 15.25 meters and have a radius of48.77 meters. In the face of French competition, Otis lost no time in preparing what became, after a number of cross-Atlantic struggles, the successful bid - largely due to the support he received from Eiffel himself (Goodwin 2001: 67-70). We shall return to Gustave Eiffel later. Escalators Like the department store, the Underground system is dependent upon the stairway, lift and escalator, to convey large numbers of people through the vertical space that it occupies. The escalator had been imag ined, drawn and patented since 1859.14 Ultimately it was the collaboration of Charles Seeberger and Otis Elevator Company which resulted in the production of the first commercial escalator. An example of this 156</page><page sequence="14">revolving stairway' was shown at the World's Fair - a subject to which we will turn later. At the turn of twentieth century the growth of London's population had forced the expansion of the Underground network in order that the commuting masses could be successfully extruded to leafy areas evoked by names such as Wood Green. The additional lines of the Piccadilly &amp; Brompton Railway also opened 1906. It was for the Piccadilly line that the architect Charles Holden (1875-1960) was commis sioned by Frank Pick, Head of London Underground, to re-design the circular booking hall, just a year after he had built the Bakerloo intersection there.15 Symbols of an all powerful empire would be strategically placed in this new station situated right at the heart of London. Oil paintings depicting a large map of the world were sited on the ceiling at the top of the 'up' escalators. In the circular ticket hall, a world clock map entitled 'The World Time Today' was installed and this feature remains in situ. The station received widespread inter national acclaim and inspired the design of the Moscow metro in the early 1930s (Boyd 2008: 258). As in the case of the lift, the escalator too has been installed on the interior and exterior of buildings presenting the joy of seeing an umbrella of sky gradu ally increase in size and the urban skyline diminish as the user travels upwards and vice versa. The architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers made a dominant feature of such an escalator in their novel design for the museum Centre George Pompidou which opened in 1977 in Paris. However the escalator is more frequently found above and below ground in the interior spaces of transport services and department stores. Lightness and space after the second industrial revolution The place of the street is a vital conduit for the move ments of sounds, smells, textures in and out of build ings, for the visual and aural communications of indi viduals unknown to each other and for transport of all kinds. Yet across Europe, too often the street is wrongly interpreted by town planners as merely the empty space between buildings. The street contains life in continual motion while the building is stationary and contains the motionless. In Rome, the lifestyle is such that indoor and outdoor living naturally intermingle: there is little distinction in terms of ambiance between the corridor within a house and the street outside. The variance has been much greater in London although both cities have grown up and spread out in a more or less random fashion. Not so in Paris where, with a remit to clear away slums and reduce crime, the intervention of Haussmann in the mid nineteenth century ensured that vast tracks of the city lost all sense of intimacy and relationship to the human body.16 At the fall of the Weimar Republic in 1933, Adolph Hitler, in a speech on architecture, said that 'only the great cultural docu ments of humanity made of granite and marble' could offer stability in a world of change and transition. He duly determined to engage in a restructuring of Berlin and presented the thirty-two year old Albert Speer with the challenge of providing a new plan which would include the giant axis, the domed hall and the triumphal arch (Whyte 1995: 261). Demolition began across Berlin destroying homes and livelihoods yet the new plan stayed where it began in 1937 - on the drawing board. Earlier, an open competition for the 157</page><page sequence="15">design of the Reichsbank headquarters was won outright by the German architect Mies van der Rohe in 1933. Yet Hitler intervened and appointed Heinrich Wolff to design this building, the last major construction until after the end World War II. Mies van der Rohe emigrated to the United States in 1937 where he lived until his death in 1969 and his award-winning design for the Reichsbank was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Between 1933 and 1945, the cultural history and development of architecture was held in stasis. In 1932 the historian and art critic, Wilhem Hausenstein wrote of Berlin, 'It is as if it were grounded on nothing, but a nothing that is the nothing - a nothingness elevated into an essence...' (Hausen stein, in Whyte-Boyd et al. 1995: 258). Colossal struc tures in stone or marble have a capacity to overwhelm and confuse our powers of perception and physically to ridicule the human form. In this way, buildings within the urban context and their relationship one with another are forever compelling. Nevertheless the permanence and durability of materials are patently at the mercy of cultural and political stability. The Industrial Revolution brought a watershed in the development of monumental architecture: stone gave way to wrought and cast iron in an age which opened up new possibilities for architecture and inspired a sense of freedom and liberty in design. This heralded a fresh appreciation of the place and function of the street in urban planning and the challenge worldwide to construct ever taller skyscrapers. In the Western world, the pioneers of design and architecture that embrace light and the notion of weightlessness have been growing in number ever since the architect Joseph Paxton designed Crystal Palace, originally erected in 1851 in Hyde Park, London, to provide the venue for the Great Exhibition that year. This was followed some decades later by French engineer Gustave Eiffel (1832-1923) and his design for the Eiffel Tower. The tower, at 324 meters high, would serve as the spectacular entrance to the World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) which opened in Paris on 6 May 1889. When construction was completed, it was the tallest structure in the world. The tower was to be demolished after the Fair although due to its unprecedented popularity it has survived to become the biggest attraction in France and most powerful symbol of Paris. Gustave Eiffel had designed a structure of momen tous proportions whereby, from the inside, people could see at last the 360 degree panorama of the city and Figure 14. Tour Eiffel under construction in 1887 at the World Fair, Paris designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel. Photographer unknown. 158</page><page sequence="16">beyond. They could look down through space to the ground below and observe the structure's relationship to the surrounding buildings and to the trajectory of the river Seine. In addition, from this new perspective the viewer could abandon themselves to the intriguing spectacle of the minute human form at the foot of the monument with the confidence of knowing that perception of the world would return to normal once they had descended safely to the ground. In the collec tion at the Muse'e Carnavalet in Le Marais, Paris, there are engravings which give a good indication of the small scale building stock of this area by the river and thus the impact the tower would have had on the city scape at the time. The Eiffel Tower has had a profound influence on architectural design, film and photography. At the time of its construction, the medium of photography had made significant progress. For example, in 1884 George Eastman had already introduced a new technology that narem Figure 15. 'View of the World's Fair, Paris, France' engraving 1889. The Art Archive Musee Carnavalet, Paris. would replace photographic plates with film and a few years later in 1888, the world's first motion picture was made.17 It is without question that the elegant and thrilling Eiffel Tower was a gift to these media. The construction firm Eiffel et Cie had recently completed a commission to provide the armature for the sculpture of the Statue of Liberty by Auguste Bartholdi (1834-1904) which would be situated on Liberty Island in 1888 along the Manhattan coastline. A copper skin surrounds the armature to create a statue with a posture based on Bartholdi's perception of the Colossus of Rhodes.18 It has become the icon of New York and a symbol of freedom, La Liberte eclairant le monde. The head of this towering monument was exhibited a year earlier at the World Fair next to the Eiffel Tower. For his film Saboteur, Alfred Hitchcock shoots film footage (Warner 1985: 50) from inside the crown and torch of the monument, engaging the viewer in the thrilling suspense of imagining themselves (in the place of the actors) climbing the spiral stairs within the structure and dangling precipitously from the hand until they drop to their death.19 Perhaps inspired by this work, the film The Man on the Eiffel Tower launched the tower's dramatic entry into popular culture in 1949.20 This thriller opens with close-up images of the crisscrossing weave of the riveted iron structure - a recurring feature filling the screen edge to edge - and ends in a spine-tingling chase to the summit of the tower. Looking down at the landscape from the top of the Tower, the main protagonist, Johann Radek (played by Franchot Tone), experiences a 'feeling of power - like watching an animal.'The closing scenes involve a film camera mounted on top of the lift cabin to describe 159</page><page sequence="17">Figure 16.

This story is made gripping by the use of photography and photographic angles that at one point eloquently convey an acute attack of vertigo The height of the Eiffel Tower effectuates a phenomenal type of displacement, unfamiliarity, movement; of experiencing the world from a unique perspective. It precipitated the arrival of the Ferris Wheel in 1893 which went on to become a prerequisite urban feature across the world.21 Upon completion, the tower brought an unprecedented visual experience which continues to stimulate millions of people today. The area at the foot of the tower has remained open, affording views across the large green stretch of Le Champ de Mars towards VEcole Militaire to the west Figure 18. Eiffel Tower view from the highest platform. Photograph by Patricia J., Wiki Commons 2005. 160</page><page sequence="18">and le Palais de Chaillot and the river Seine to the east. At the beginning of the twentieth century the tower was already functional in terms of providing radio transmissions between France and the United States. Today, radio and television are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower. Largely due to the relatively low skyline of Paris, it is a monument to be enjoyed from many far flung areas of the city centre. As a result of the World's Fair, replicas of the Eiffel Tower started to spring into position all over the world and continue to inspire similar designs. A roguish use of Eiffel's design is found in Sydney atop the Amalga mated Wireless Australia Building, the awa Tower.22 The main building is a fine of example of Australian Art Deco architecture of the 1930s. Documentation in the State Library of New South Wales states that the tower was integral to the design although the white communications tower, looking remarkably like the Eiffel Tower, is a somewhat incongruous addition to the overall design. Long before his emigration to the United States, Mies van der Rohe had found critical recognition and had an established reputation. His design ethos, espe cially his 'skin and bones' approach of his later years, continues to reverberate throughout the world of architecture and design. There is no question that his work, in architecture and education, has had a profound impact on the design of free and open spaces which are the hallmark of Modernist architecture. His maxim that 'architecture is the will of the people translated into space' (New York Times, 19 August 1969) is an eloquent observation about the development of archi tectural trends. He designed a number of seminal buildings including domestic homes and the Seagram Figure 19. AWA Tower, York Street Sydney; 46m tall, overall building, height 55m designed by Morrow and Gordon in 1934-7. Photograph by Jane Boyd, 2008. Building in Manhattan and the year before he died, his scheme for the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin was completed. Here materials, particularly glass and steel, are used to create a certain detailed elegance which was revolutionary at the time. In 1928, Mies van der Rohe worked on his pioneering scheme for the design of the German Pavilion to be sited at the 1929 International 161</page><page sequence="19">Exhibition in Barcelona, Spain.23 Here, he uses traver tine limestone and marble to create partitions and suggest walls rather than actually establishing either; he augments these materials with steel and glass which succeed in blurring the distinction between inside and out and result in a building that is totally integrated with its surroundings. The use of water enhances one's experience of the environment by bringing a sense of depth and doubling the height of an otherwise lateral structure. He has created a powerful environment, so spiritual in character that it brings to mind the still, meditative quality of the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas. Remarkably, the design and construction of the German Pavilion and the Chrysler Building,24an exercise in Art Deco architecture, occurred in exactly the same year. In 1931, Walter Gropius founder of the Bauhaus movement observed: Glass is the purest form of building material made from earthly matter. It can mark the limits to spaces, it can protect us against the weather, but at the same time opens up spaces, it is light and incorporeal. Although glass as such has been known to us for many years, it is the technical age we now live in with all its modern manufacturing processes that has rendered this substance one of the most valuable materials of our day and of the future. Glass archi tecture, until recently deemed purely Utopian, is now a reality. (Gropius in Slessor 1998: 70). Since his prophetic statement, glass, iron and steel have become primary building materials in an epoch which frequently requires that a) an interior space is enhanced Figure 20. Barcelona Pavilion, 1929. Photograph by Ashley Pomeroy, 2010. by absorption of the exterior environment and conversely, b) by reflection, visual access into many urban buildings is denied as the glass window has given way to the monumental tinted glass wall. At one time, domestic architecture and even large constructions had an anthropomorphic quality whereby windows had all the character of eyes, and doorways of mouths, into which one could look and imagine what lay beyond the dark void: a certain physiognomy was recognizable which paved the way for dialogue and interaction with the built environment. At the turn of the twenty-first century, architects have at their disposal new developments in glass and plastics technologies and these are becoming a part of world class architec tural designs often reasserting the anthropomorphic in shapes which appear to mimic magnified life forms of uncertain origin. The Millennium Commission in the uk initiated a large number of Millennium Projects including major schemes for new architecture across 162</page><page sequence="20">the country.25 Of these schemes we will focus on three projects by Grimshaw Architects, Foster and Partners, and Marks Barfield Architects respectively. The Eden Project, St Austell, Cornwall, UK The first geodesic dome to be patented was designed by the American engineer Buckminster Fuller in 1945 and by 1949 he had designed a dome that could support its own weight.26 In an interview, Fuller explained: 'I am not trying to imitate nature, I am trying to find the principals she is using.'27 He, like Rohe was an educator and a dogged advocate of sustainable design in archi tecture and industrial design. Nicholas Grimshaw, among many other architects, has been listening. In the Eden Project, Grimshaw has effectuated a series of ecosystems in which different natural environ ments are recreated. The visitor journeys from the Mediterranean to the Tropics in a series of domes where fully grown palm trees and giant bamboo can be found growing grow side by side. Each dome consists of hundreds of hexagonal and pentagonal plastic cells within tubular steel frames and the largest dome, the Tropical biome, covers 1.56 hectares The Tropical biome is 55 meters high, a hundred meters wide and two hundred meters long and, like the true geodesic dome, it is completely self-supporting. The whole complex is cradled deep within the barren environment of a disused clay mine in Cornwall. Now the man-made crater of the clay mine is brimming with an organic, flowing complex of spherical cavities which in turn are filled with life. This is 'skin and bones' architecture at its most minimal. Each plastic cell has been structurally designed by Anthony Hunt to provide optimum ecological efficiency.28 In time these geodesic domes could serve many different uses, indeed it is as if they have been designed with this mind: the ethos behind Grimshaw's work is structure, order, detail and flexibility. On his first inspection of the site, he exclaimed: Figure 21. Panoramic view of the Eden Project, Cornwall UK, designed 2001 by Grimshaw Architects. Photograph by Jurgen Matern. 163</page><page sequence="21">When I first saw it, we came to the rim of this crater and it was completely like a lost world. You couldn't see it from anywhere else because it's a crater on top of a hill, you can't see into it, it was almost as if nobody knew it was there and it had enormous impact and somehow this idea of the thing, as like a row of bubbles clinging to the side of it - exactly like some sort of cocoon or something which you might have found in nature....29 During the first eight months after it opened in 2001 the Eden Project received 1.7 million visitors.30 It is the largest greenhouse in the world and has become a venue for a wide variety of attractions including major pop concerts and sculpture exhibitions. However, the enduring attraction of these colossal biomes is that, by means of their structure, they are able to provide envi ronments for thousands of plants from all over the world in something approaching a gigantic botanical museum. The visitor is dwarfed and brought into stark confrontation with the primacy of a balanced ecosystem in order to sustain life on the planet as they walk the narrow paths between the flora. A visitor to the Eden Project in 2001 wrote:[on] the left is the Humid Tropic Biome, a massive bulbous structure of four interconnecting domes. Simply to stand and gawp is terrific, even if you never venture inside. To find this building anywhere would be a treat, to happen on it in the middle of a cratered countryside adds to the mystique.'31 When the Eden Project was opened the response was overwhelming: architecture has become a powerful way of connecting geometry in nature with nature. Figure 22. Inside the Humid Tropics Biome at The Eden Project designed 2001 by Grimshaw Architects. Photograph by Steve Keiretsu, 2001. The Great Court at the British Museum, London By the turn of this century, engineering and manufac turing processes have pushed the evolution of materials such as glass and steel to new limits. Now, architects and engineers together are able to devise new structural methodologies with their design teams and to achieve a design process for the conception of ever more minimal ways of configuring glass walls and roofs, notablv hanging glazed panels from point fixings (Slessor 1998: 70-73). The window has evolved from a simple glazed aperture into an architectural skin capable of variable functions. With the advent and continuing refinement of low-emissivity coatings and variable transmission methods such as photochromies, electrochromics and thermochromics, the responsive, multi-layered skin has become a key element in environmental control. Yet 164</page><page sequence="22">the concept of an external skin with multiple environ mental functions is not in itself new: Le Corbusier first attempted to devise a mur neutralisant in the early 1930s, for the Cite de la Refuge in Paris. Over sixty years later, Norman Foster designed a modern, high perfor mance version of a mur neutralisant for his complex of buildings at the science and business park in Duisburg (Slessor 1998: 73). At the British Museum in 1998 Foster was engaged in a major architectural interven tion which would dramatically transform the experi ence of the building. Its facades facing the courtyard were to be cleaned and restored and a new glazed roof would be installed to cover the entire courtyard, with the idea of, paradoxically, opening up the museum to the public. This, the Great Court, is now the largest covered courtyard in Europe. The south portico, which had been demolished in the 1870s to enlarge the museum's entrance hall, has been rebuilt enabling visitors to walk directly into the new space.The building opened in December 2000, taking just two and a half years to complete (Barker Don Foster and Partners 2001: Dl.l). At the time he was awarded the commission, Norman Foster was working on an intervention at the Reichstag, the New German Parliament where his transformation of the building would bring a new landmark in the form of a glazed cupola in the centre of the roof of the building. The cupola was designed to serve as a 'symbol of the vigor of the German demo cratic process.'32 It was, therefore, a logical step to pursue construction of the glazed canopy for the Great Court at the British Museum. The Court is a vast white cavernous space. Monu mental sculptures in the Museum's collection are Figure 23. The Great court of the British Museum, with the new tessellated roof design by Foster and Partners arching around the original, circular Reading Room of the British Library. Photography by Andrew Dunn, 2005. overcome by the expansive lattice of light that forms the alluring roof canopy and yet the relationship between people and these exhibits is inexplicably enhanced. Under the canopy, which is a glass and steel 165</page><page sequence="23">construction designed by the engineers Buro Happold, the central feature is the former Round Reading Room, constructed in 1854-57 and designed by Sydney Smirke. It is a 43 meters wide domed construction, at the time the second largest after the Pantheon. Since 2000, the Great Court has made a profound impact on the Museum and the civic identity of London. The London Eye, South Bank London The London Eye, composed of glass and steel, is the product of architects David Marks and Julia Barfield's long-held aspiration to place a ferris wheel in the heart of London and new engineering technology has made this possible. Its history is rooted in an idea which sparked the imagination of the directors of the World's Columbian Exposition, held in 1893: why not commis sion a monument, something 'original, daring and unique' that would challenge the Eiffel Tower?33 The American engineer, George Ferris, made a faltering start when his design was considered too extravagant, yet ultimately he won the contract and the popularity was such that his design set the trail for similar struc tures to be erected around the world.34 The architects for the London Eye devised a plan to build a Ferris wheel, currently the largest in Europe, with thirty two capsules representing the number of boroughs in London. It received its first passengers in 2000 and was expected to remain for just five years. However, as a testament to the tangible success of this major landmark on the London skyline, the Eye will remain until at least 2025. In the glass capsules, passen gers move freely from one side to the other and, during the course of the very gradual rotation, see the entire panorama from a height of 135 meters above London. Figure 24. The London Eye 2001 from the South Bank Promenade. Photograph by Jane Boyd, 2011. It provides a unique look-out post, allowing people gradually to ascend and descend through vertical space. However, for some, the thought of being suspended in a capsule almost entirely made of glass and suspended high above the ground, prohibits sharing in the enjoy ment that the Eye gives to so many. The structure is strategically sited on the river bank at the hub of major 166</page><page sequence="24">tourist attractions - the Tower of Big Ben and the Southbank Centre - which includes a number of Brutalist arts buildings such as the National Theatre, designed by Denys Lasdun.35 This is clearly a location that has all the hallmarks of a world class entertain ment centre which is decisively enhanced by the recent addition of the London Eye. Illuminated at dusk, the London Eye gives a sublime visual experience day or night which belies the seven year effort of the architects and the revolutionary tech nical expertise from seven countries to realize its construction.36 At 23 meters tall, the spindle is about the size of a church spire and, together with the hub, weighs 330 tonnes.37 The skeletal structure was carried in pieces by barge down the River Thames and hoisted into position close to Westminster Bridge. At that moment this particular Millennium Project struck the imagination of the people, since it afforded an extraor dinary spectacle as passers-by could watch the unique operation take place on a vast platform in the River. For here the wheel was assembled and slowly hoisted up, out the water, to become the London Eye. In their book, the chief architects include a state ment made by the internationally renowned British architect Richard Rogers as follows: The Eye has done for London what the Eiffel Tower did for Paris, which is to give it a symbol and to let people climb above the city and look back down on it. Not just specialists or rich people, but everybody. That's the beauty of it: it is public and accessible, and it is in a great position at the heart of London.

Photograph by Jane Boyd , 2011. A primal instinct to create shelter has evolved to become a mission to build a tower to reach to the heavens. Superstar architects such as Renzo Piano and Norman Foster whose Shard London Bridge (also known as The Shard and the Hermitage Plaza at La Defense respectively are already posing fresh questions about how human beings interact with space.38 The essential concept for The Shard was brought to public attention when it was put down on paper nearly eleven years ago. Since then, Londoners have been involved with the idea and the construction process, and have engaged in anticipating how this glass-clad design will effect change in the neighborhood. Another urban trophy perhaps, but as the building rises above its tallest neighbors, so we have risen to the social, cultural, 167</page><page sequence="25">political challenges it presents almost as if in prepara tion for the formidable, unimaginable Vertical city'that this building will embody.39 Now, instead of taking place at different locations in more or less horizontal space, an entire life style will, for some, be experienced by oscillating through space far above the hum of urban life. The Shard, may not be a building for 'everybody', although its situation, edifice and Observatory are likely to generate an astonishing sense of place at ground level - there to be occupied, indulged and to satisfy a primal need for defined space.
