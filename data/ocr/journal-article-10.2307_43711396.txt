<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HAND OF JUDITH* 1. "By the hand of . . To begin at some distance from the main point, we may consider Wis 11,1, which in the CCD translation reads, "She [i.e., Wisdom] made their affairs prosper through the holy prophet." In the Greek original, the last phrase is en cheiri prophētou ' agiou , with en cheiri to be regarded as Semitic idiom in Greek, corresponding to the Hebrew or Aramaic com- pound preposition beyad ,ł The "hand," as such, has no necessary meaning of its own in this context. And when we say in the Creed qui locutus est per prophetas, the last phrase has an analogue in Dn 9,10, where the Alex- andrian translator gives dia tõn prophêtõn, while the Hebrew prototype is beyad hannebî'tm. Once again, the "hand" of a prophet is not often directly connected with the message he delivers. There is a group of passages in Judith which may in part be dealt with similarly. Thus Jdt 8,33 episkepsetai Kurios ton Israel en cheiri mou may be rendered, "The Lord will take care of Israel through me." Jdt 9,10, thrauson autõn to anastema en cheiri thēleias could be, "Shatter their pride through a woman." Jdt 12,4, (eôs an poiësç en cheiri mou (a ebou - leusato could be, "until He accomplishes through me what He has planned." In the Greek of Jdt 13,14, however, though the underlying Hebrew was undoubtedly identical, ethrause tous echthrous ' êmõn dia cheiros mou makes of the hand a meaningful instrument: "He has shat- tered our enemies through my hand" - the translator did not say, "through me." In the next verse, 13,15, we lapse back into ambiguity, and epataxen auton fo Kurios en cheiri thēleias could be merely, "The Lord struck him through a woman." In Jdt 15,10, however, a similar rendering becomes impossible: epoiēsas tauta panta en cheiri sou can only be, "You have done all this with your hand."2 It is again possible that Jdt 16,5, Kurios Pantokratõr ēthetēsen autous en cheiri thēleias could be simply, "The Lord Almighty set them at naught through a woman." But as the last of these occurrences, the only one we have passed over, we may consider Jdt 9,9 dos en cheiri mou tēs chēras fo dienoēthēn kratos . It would seem we must render, "Endow my widow's hand with strength for my pur- * Dedicated to Dr. Theodore C. Petersen, C.S.P., in his eightieth year. 1 The idiom haflīaķ beyad which underlies Wis 11,1 occurs in Gn 39,3; and the Greek equivalent, as in Wis, appears four times in 1-2 Mc. It presumes God (or Wisdom) as the primary agent. 2 RSV's "You have done all this singlehanded" means, let us hope, the same thing; the Greek cannot mean, "You have done all this by yourself." 94</page><page sequence="2">The Hand of Judith 95 pose." If so, the Greek of 13,14 dia cheiros mou is right: the hand is in itself important. This is confirmed by the language of 9,2: "God of my father Simeon, into whose hand You put a sword for vengeance."3 It is pretty generally agreed that the central theme of the Book of Judith is broached only with the appearance in the narrative of Judith herself, at the beginning of chapter 8. The first 7 chapters are prologue and setting the scene. Once Judith appears, her hand is spoken of eight times: by herself in prayer (twice), and in talking with the city elders of Bethulia, with Holofernes, and with all the people of her city (twice) ; by the high priest and his followers ; and by all Israel in the canticle. Why this recurrent reference to the hand? As for the action itself, in 9,9 Judith prays for strength to her hand, but when the moment arrives, with 13,4, she prays, "Look upon the works of my hands,"4 and with 13,7 again, not "Strengthen my hand," but "Strengthen me, O God of Israel." Why, then, the hand in eight or nine other places? True, it could be an echo of Jael in Jgs 5,26; though when Jael's hand, simply, is spoken of, it is the left hand which is meant ; her right hand is designated by the exact term, yeminãh. With Judith, "hand" presumably means the right hand, though this is never said. 2. Poetry and Prose One approach to the items in the Judith narrative which the sacred writer considers important might be, to find the things which are already mentioned in the action, that are used again in the terms of the solemn thanksgiving in the canticle of chapter 16. In attempting this, we may restrict ourselves to Jdt 16,1-12, the portion of the canticle which was composed to reflect directly the events of the prose narrative. In fact, Jdt 16,13-17 is an anthology5 of praise to the Lord that transcends the action of the Book in the motives it proposes. Judith's initial promise (8,33) is, "The Lord will take care of Israel 3 Of the nine passages cited, the "hand" is present in the retroversion of Y. M. Grintz, Sefer Yehudith (Jerusalem, 1957) in every case. It is eliminated from the Simeon passage, 9,2, in both BJ and RSV. Otherwise, it appears in these renderings, except for BJ 8,33 par mon entremise ; RSV 9,9 "give to me, a widow, the strength" ; BJ 12,4 Par moi . For RSV 15,10 see n.2. The peculiar recension that is our Vulgate has corresponding "hand" references only at 9,15; 12,4; 13,18-19; 16,7; and God's hand, not Judith's, in 15,11. Abridgement early in the Book (including 2,12, see section 4. of this article), and more mechanical rendering later, are the tendencies at work in this. 4 This may be an adaptation of Ps 89 (90), 17, as v.g., Jdt 6,19 is an adaptation of Ps 83 (84), 10b. 5 From the Psalms, from Jgs 5, and from Isaia. Cf. the marginal references in BJ, for example.</page><page sequence="3">96 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol.25 by my hand." It is Israel that gives thanks in the canticle (16, Iff.), as we shall see again below. Judith's prayer in 9,7-10, refers to the multitude and military strength of the Assyrian enemy. She says (9,7-8) that they have not known "that You are the Lord who crushes wars: the Lord is Your name/' The canticle (16,2) uses the same formula: "(For) God, who crushes wars, is the Lord" (cf. Ex 15,3 LXX). This is followed (16,3-4) by a reference to the numerous Assyrians and the threat they represented. Both contexts introduce at this point elements which allude directly to the Hebrew Exodus from Egypt, as we shall see below. The theme of the woman's hand is in both Judith's prayer (9,9-10) and the song (16,5). It may be said to epitomize the action which is detailed in cc.10-13, and again in the canticle, 16,6-9. The effect on the foreign enemy is in ch. 14 of the prose, and v. 10 of the song has a similar development. The joy of the Israelites generally, and their share in the victory, is in both ch. 15 and vv. 11-12 of the song. 3. The Two Canticles: Jdt 16,1-12 and Ex 15,1-19 There is, then, a studied parallel between the action as described, and the terms of the canticle in Jdt. If, therefore, it becomes apparent that the song is an echo of another canticle, describing other action, it will be time to examine whether the prose narrative, in its own way, does not reflect the events which prompted the original song. But there is no doubt as to what is the poetic prototype for the canticle of Jdt : it is the canticle at the Exodus (Ex 15,1-19) connected with the name of Miriam. The festive participation of all Israel, including the women, is the same in both. Judith looms more prominent than Miriam, mainly because on her festive occasion there is no Moses present. The speaker on both occasions is Israel, or the Israelites singly and in chorus. For Ex 15 this needs hardly be demonstrated: the 'āšīrā(h) of v. 1, before Miriam's part is mentioned, and the wayyô'merû lē'mor of the introduction are evidence enough. For Jdt 16 the case is somewhat different; and in view of the "And Judith said" of 16,1, we shall have to prove the point, not always recognized by translators or commentators, that she nowhere speaks in her own name, but only as an individual Israelite and in the name of the nation. In the opening couplet, with its plural verbs, no special speaker is called for; either Judith or Israel could say, "my God."6 No identifiable speaker is implied in the quotation of Ex 15,3 which is Jdt 16,2a (see below) ; though in Ex the speaker is Israel, or the Israelite as such. With 16,2b-c, however, we find that the received text reads: ® Though of course one thinks of Anna in 1 Sm 2,1.</page><page sequence="4">1963] The Hand of Judith 97 'oti eis parembólas autou en mesę laou exeilato me ek cheiros katadiõkontõn me This is rendered in RSV : for he has delivered me out of the hands of my pursuers, and brought me into his camp, in the midst of the people. The inversion of the two units in translation shows that the thought se- quence is not without some awkwardness. As it stands, the text would seem to refer to Judith's safe return from the Assyrian camp; though in fact nobody was pursuing her, and "my persecutors," which is more pre- cisely the meaning of the phrase in question, is not especially appropriate to Judith as a distinct individual. Who is the "me" in this verse? Since we have just had a quotation from Ex at Jdt 16,2a, we might look to see if the language of 2b-c does not echo something similar. And indeed, in the Jethro narrative, Ex 18, we find the following in three successive verses: Ex 18,8 "all the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt for the sake of Israel . . . and how the Lord delivered them." Ex 18,9 "Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians." Ex 18,10 "the Lord, who delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians." In LXX, the relationship is even closer. Of course, in Jdt we are dealing with the Assyrians, not the Egyptians. But the term katadiõkontõn , used in Jdt 16,2c to designate the Assyrian persecutors, echoes the use of the same verb four times in Ex 14, 4,8,9,23 to describe the Egyptian pursuit of the Israelites. Instead of pursuit "after them" ( o pisõ autõn ), which is the Exodus idiom, the expression in Jdt has taken on overtones of direct per- secution from the language of the Psalms, v.g., Ps 30(31)16 rusai me ek cheiros tõn echthrõn mou kai ek tõn katadiõkontõn me, "Save me from the hand of my enemies, and from my persecutors." Nevertheless the pre- sumption must remain very strong that the "me" of Jdt 16,2c is the Israel who is pursued and delivered in Exodus.7 When one goes on to examine the repeated "my" of Jdt 16,4 and 11 ("my mountains," "my 7 It might be thought that the Greek expressions exeilato ek cheiros and katadiõkein are sufficiently common so that a link with any number of passages could be set up. Within the Book of Exodus, however, to which we are directed on other grounds, katadiõkein occurs only in the four places cited above from ch. 14 (for which, in relation to Jdt, cf. section 6, below) ; the underlying Hebrew r-d-p „ for pursuit, has one additional occurrence in Ex, significantly at Ex 15,9 in the- canticle itself, where LXX has diõxas. For deliverance from someone's hand, it should be noted that the Ex 18 references (including 18,4, Moses from the hand of Pharaoh) are in the context of retelling the events of the Exodus itself. The same idiom occurs in LXX at Ex 3,8, the promise that 18,8ff. sees fulfilled. Here, too,. MT preserves one additional instance, in 2,19: Raguel's daughters delivered by Moses, from the hand of shepherds ; surely a verbal anticipation, as the story is now told, oi the more striking deliverance to follow.</page><page sequence="5">98 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol.25 young men," "my nursing infants," "my small children," "my lowly ones," "my weaklings"), where no one has any doubt that Israel is the speaker, the matter becomes certain: Israel is the speaker represented by the "me" of 16,2c. If this is the case, what of 16,2b foti eis par embolas autou en mesÇ laou ? Simply, the received text, which RSV has followed, contains a bad read- ing. With BJ, the Latin, the Syriac, and one minuscule (f: foti theis ) we read, €o titheis parembolas autou en mesÇ laou? Jdt 16,2 then reads : For God, who crushes wars, is the Lord; he who set his camp in the people's midst has delivered me from the hand of my persecutors. All parts of the verse allude to Ex ; but not simply so, and we shall return to it again. Continuing our comparison between Ex 15 and Jdt 16,1-12, we may note the enemy's armament (Ex 15,4; Jdt 16,3), his threats (Ex 15,9; Jdt 16,4) ; the Lord's destruction of the enemy, attributed in Ex 15,6 to His right hand, and in Jdt 16,6 to the hand of a woman as His instru- ment. The minimum point of resemblance here is, that the destroying action in both cases is the Lord's. In each poem, the principal event (the Exodus, the slaying of Holofernes) is followed by terror spread among the nations. In Ex 15,13-16, those who are struck with fear are not the original enemy, the Egyptians, but rather the inhabitants of Palestine and its environs. The consequence of the Exodus is the settlement of Israel in the "mountain" of the Lord's inheritance (Ex 15,17). In Jdt on the other hand, Israel already speaks of this as "my mountain" in 16,4. There is to be no shift of the geographical scene; and the Medes and Persians who are struck with fear in 16,10 and slaughtered in the following verse are the same army of Holofernes described as Assyrians in 16,3 and everywhere in the prose. The change of national names is but a formal literary echo of the development in Ex 15. That there is an undercurrent of reference to Persians elsewhere in Jdt no one will deny; but they are not distinct from the "Assyrian" army of Nabuchodonosor, as a com- parison of Jdt 16,11-12 and the prose counterpart in Jdt 14,18-15,7 makes evident. 4. The Prose Narrative in Judith: The Theme of the Hand It stands to reason that the themes in Jdt, if they reflect the Exodus, will not do so without some overtones of later events, and of other Bib- 8 The opportunity for garbling eo titheis at the beginning of a stich, when the preceding stich begins with ' o ti theos, needs only to be mentioned. The literary antecedent of the ' o titheis reading, namely Is 63,9, is discussed in section 5. below.</page><page sequence="6">1963] The Hand of Judith 99 lical books. But by following the theme of the "hand"9 through the prose of Jdt, it will be possible to see both these later influences, and how the parallel with the Exodus underlies and explains them all. In the preparatory chapters, Jdt 1-7, the term "hand," in the singular, occurs only once. This is in 2,12, and it is the hand of Nabuchodonosor. "For as I live," he says, "and by my royal might, I have spoken, and I will do these things by my hand." With this we should take 3,8: "And he [Holofernes] had been enjoined to destroy all the gods of the land, so that all nations might worship Nabuchodonosor himself alone; and that all their tongues and all their races might invoke him as God." In the latter passage, we can recognize a development of the Nabuchodonosor of Dn 3, influenced by the trappings of Hellenistic kingship after Alexander.10 The basic opposition between this Nabuchodonosor, described as an Assyrian, and the God of Israel, is however an outgrowth of Is 10,5-14. These verses portray the Assyrian as saying, contrary to the intentions of God (v. 7), that he will destroy a series of Western states including Jerusalem (vv. 9,11 ; cp. Jdt 1,12) ; and that he will do this by the might of his hand (w. 10,13,14). The prose gloss in Is 10, 1211 says that when the Lord cuts short the doings of the king of Assyria against Mt. Sion and Jerusalem, He will make a visitation (MT ' epqõd ) against the pride of that monarch.12 If in Jdt 2,12 we have from Is 10 the boasting of the Assyrian, and his doing by the strength of his hand, the "As I live" in the same verse does not come from Is. It is thought of by the author of Jdt as an oath proper to divinity (which he thus implies that his Nabuchodonosor 9 The idiom that someone is sold, or given, into the hands of someone else, occurs in Jdt 6,10 in an incidental way. The same idiom in Jdt 7,25 ; 10,15 can be read with overtones deriving from Jdt 2,12 discussed above. The touching of holy things with laymen's hands (11,13) is an obvious and casual reference. Holofernes speaks (11,22) of strength in the hands of the Assyrians, another echo of 2,12. The hand of a bystander (14,6) and the hands of Judith holding branches (15,12) occur without special significance. These are the only passages in Jdt where "hand" or "hands" occurs, that are not discussed in this article. For "right hand," see n.14. 10 See the note in BJ at Jdt 3,8. 11 For the present writer's explanation of how the gloss which is Is 10,12 came into existence, cf. CBQ 14 (1952) 236. 12 The LXX of Is 10,8 has the king of Assyria make his boast when people say to him, "You alone are ruler." This garbled rendering throws the whole context into connection with the claims attributed in Is 14 to the king of Babylon, and in Is 47,10 to Babylon itself as sovereign mistress. The development serves to show that Jdt is not the only instance of the implications of Is 10 being construed in a transcendent fashion.</page><page sequence="7">100 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol.25 claims; compare the words of Holofernes, "Who is God, except Nabu- chodonosor ?" 6,2). He draws this oath from Dt 32,39-41, Learn then that I, I alone, am God, and there is no god besides me. It is I who bring both death and life, I who inflict wounds and heal them, and from my hand there is no rescue. To the heavens I raise my hand and swear: As surely as I live forever, I will sharpen my flashing sword, and my hand shall lay hold of judgment. The hand of God, therefore, is understood to be opposed to the hand of Nabuchodonosor. The song in Dt 32 has also present in it the hand of a human enemy to which the hand of God is opposed (32,26-27) : I would have said, "I will make an end of them . . ." Had I not feared . . . that these foes would mistakenly boast, "Our own hand won the victory; the Lord had nothing to do with it." The same opposition of the hand of the enemy, in this case Pharaoh, to the hand of God is present also in the Exodus canticle, at Ex 15,9, which says, The enemy said, "I will pursue and overtake them ; I will divide the spoils and have my fill of them; I will draw my sword; my hand shall despoil them." But in vv. 6,12, it is God's right hand that gains the victory. This right hand of God, which overthrew the enemy at the Exodus, is never mentioned in Judith.13 That it was always in the author's thoughts, it is part of the purpose of this discussion to demonstrate. In Jdt 8,33, "The Lord will care for Israel by my hand," we need not dwell overmuch on the verbal link between its episkepsetai and the 'epqõd of Is 10,12, which is the collateral visitation of punishment against the Assyrian. Rather, the "care for" of Jdt 8,33 reflects Ex 3,16, "I am deeply concerned about you and about the way you are being treated in Egypt," and the recurrence of the same Hebrew verb in Ex 13,19, "when God should care for them," with its reference to the promise of the 13 In Vulg. only, at 15,11(10), we read, Ideo et manus Domini confortavit te; this is also present in the longer Ma'aśeh Yehûdît among the minor Midrashim, cf. J. D. Eisenstein, Ö2ar Midrashim (New York, 1928) 209, where it is an indication of dependence on the Vulgate. For dexia see n.14. For dependence of the Hebrew midrashim about Judith on the Latin, see Eisenstein, op. cit., 204, and Grintz, op. cit., (n.3 above), 196-204.</page><page sequence="8">1963] The Hand of Judith 101 patriarch Joseph in Gn 50,24 that God would surely care for Israel. The reply of the elders in Jdt 8,34 recognizes this when they say, "And may the Lord God go before you [cf. Ex 13,21 ; 14,19] for vengeance on our enemies." The vengeance phrase, however, comes from Dt 32,41 With vengeance I will repay my foes and requite those who hate me (cf. also Dt 32,43 MT and LXX). The hand of God, which is active in the Deuteronomy context, as we have seen above, receives a limited human counterpart in the hand of Simeon, in Jdt 9,2, "Lord, God of my father Simeon, into whose hand you put a sword for vengeance against the foreigners." In the prayer of Jdt (ch. 9) the references to Ex are interwoven with the theme of the "hand." Thus Simeon's hand (9,2) is used for a vengeance which Judith ascribes to God in the words, "For this you gave their chiefs to slaughter . . . and you struck down slaves as well as rulers, and the rulers upon their thrones" (9,3). Praying for her own success she says (9,10) : "smite, through my guileful lips, slave as well as chief, and the chief as well as his servant" ; then immediately, "Shatter their pride by the hand of a woman." Now, beds make a parallel between the Simeon narrative (Gn 34) and the lust and the slaying of Holofernes; but no throne is concerned in either story. The thrones, and the rulers, and the servants ( therapõn ), and the slaves, and God's smiting, come from the slaughter of the firstborn (Ex 11,5; 12,29). We have seen that the Yhwh 'is milhãmã(h), Yhwh semo of Ex 15,3 is quoted in Jdt 9,7-8. The form of the quotation 'oti su ei Kurios suntribõn polemous, Kurios onoma sou, which is the LXX adaptation, proves at least, to claim no more, that the translator of Jdt identified the reference and supplied the familiar Greek form from Ex. This he did also in the allusion of Jdt 9,10, thrauson autõn to anastema en cheiri thēleias. The prototype is Ex 15,6 "Your right hand, O Lord, has shattered the enemy," for which LXX gives 'e dexia sou cheir , Kurie , ethrausen echthrous . Thus Judith prays that as the hand of her forefather Simeon had mediated the vengeance of the Lord, so now her hand may shatter the pride of the enemy as the Lord's instrument, reviving the action which in Ex 15,6 is ascribed to the Lord's own right hand.14 Just before the other reference to Judith's hand in this context (9,9) "Endow my widow's hand with 14 The combination of both terms, cheir as well as dexia, is unique to Ex 15,6c in LXX, apart from Gn 48,14-17, where y ad yemînô occurs, exceptionally, in the Hebrew. The term dexia appears in Jdt only as a variant reading of S* at 9,11, for dunasteia (of God). If dexia were original here, which is on several counts improbable, the unique occurrence would still fit in with the entire trend of thought in this article.</page><page sequence="9">102 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol.25 strength for my purpose/' the aposteilon tēn orgēn sou is an echo of Ex 15,7 te sallah harõnekã, where LXX similarly has apesteilas tēn orgēn sou . The theme of the hand is next resumed when Judith stands before Holofernes. She makes a cryptic statement (12,4) to the effect that her food supply will not give out "before he [i.e., the Lord, who is not mentioned directly] accomplishes through my hand what he has planned." As in the Nabuchodonosor context of 2,12, the underlying text here is from Isaia, namely : As I have resolved, so shall it be; as I have proposed, so shall it stand: I will break the Assyrian in my land and trample him on my mountains .... This is the plan proposed for the whole earth, and this the hand outstretched over all nations. The Lord of hosts has planned : who can thwart him ? his hand is stretched out; who can turn it back? (Is 14,24-27) The plan is Goďs; the hand in Jdt 12,4 is Judith's. In Ex 15,12, addressed to the Lord, we have, "You stretched out your right hand: the earth swallowed them up." Yet the link at this point between Jdt and Ex is in the action, rather more than in the words. Judith sleeps till midnight; "towards the dawn watch" ( pros tēn 'eothinēn phulakēn) 12,5, she asks to go out to pray. Her departure on the night of the slaying, "and the two of them went out together as had been their custom" (13,10), is in accordance with this pattern. She is in Bethulia in time to have Holofernes' head hanging from the ramparts before dawn and sunrise (14,2). Now in Ex 11,4, the slaughter of the firstborn takes place at midnight. Even more to the point, however, is that at the Sea itself, the Lord fights for the Israelites "In the night watch, just before dawn" ( be'asmõret hàbbõqer ) Ex 14,24-25; in LXX this is en tę phulakę tę ' eothinę . Or, as Ex 14,27 has it, at the turn towards morning ( lipnõt hàbbõqer) the sea returned to its normal depth. Our next passage is Jdt 13,14-15, where we have, "Praise God, who has not withdrawn his mercy from the house of Israel, but has shattered our enemies through my hand this night"; and then, "And the Lord smote him by the hand of a woman." After a phrase from Ps 65(66)20, we have here again allusions to Ex 15,6, "Your right hand, O Lord, has shattered the enemy," and to the smiting of the firstborn in Ex 12, both of which we saw in connection with Jdt 9,13. In 15,10, "You have done all this with your hand," addressed to Judith, is the simplest of language ; but it is an explicit counterpart to the boast of Nabuchodonosor in 2,12, so that ultimately it reflects Isaia, as we have seen above.</page><page sequence="10">1963] The Hand of Judith 103 5. The Exodus, Jerusalem and Judith: Links in Pss and Is In the prose, as in the poetry, what is done by Judith's hand is therefore a revival in some sense of what was done by Goďs hand at the Exodus. This concept of a revival of the work of the Exodus is, of course, by no means unique in the Bible; we need only mention Is 40-55. In Jdt, however, this revival shows certain characteristics not found in Is 40-55, but for which a precise literary source does exist. This is Ps 45(46), which has influenced in its day the very wording of the song in Ex 15 itself, in its LXX rendering. Jewish students of the Book of Judith have always taken it for obvious, that the city defended by the heroine is not really Bethulia, but Jerusalem. In this the narrative bears them out. Judith tells the elders the fate of the sanctuary depends upon them (8,24). Her prayer for the defeat of the enemy asks that God may punish through her those who have laid plans against Sion and its sanctuary (9,8,13). The elders bid her godspeed to work for the exaltation of Jerusalem (10,8) ; in her prayer before she strikes Holofernes, she recalls the same phrase (13,4). To the high priest and his council, when her deed is accomplished, she is the exaltation of Jerusalem (15,9). Now, the composition which links the defense of Jerusalem to Goďs intervention at the Exodus is Ps 45(46), of which we must quote w. 2,5-7, 9-11. God is our refuge and our strength, an ever-present help in distress. There is a stream whose runlets gladden the city of God:14ft the holy dwelling of the Most High. God is in its midst; it shall not be disturbed; God will help it at the break of dawn. Though nations are in turmoil, kingdoms totter, his voice resounds, the earth melts away, . . . Come! behold the deeds of the Lord, the astounding things he has wrought on earth: He has stopped wars to the end of the earth : the bow he breaks; he splinters the spears; he burns the shields with fire. Desist! and confess that I am God, exalted among the nations, exalted upon the earth. God, who is in the midst of His city, will help it at the break of dawn ( lipnõt habbõqer). The reference in the latter phrase to Ex 14,27 was not lost on the LXX translator of Ex 15. Because of it he renders Yhwh 'is milhãmã(h) in Ex 15,3 by Kurios suntribõn polemous, adapting 14a For this punctuation, and the understanding of Ps 45(46)5, see now H. Junker in Bib 43 (1962) 197-201.</page><page sequence="11">104 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol.25 Ps 45(46)10 to remove the anthropomorphism of the earlier text. This association of the Lord, crushing wars, with His everpresent help (Ps 45 [46] ,2), as exemplified first by the Exodus, is not confined to the LXX translator of Ex 15. Is LXX makes the same connection : the phrase 'is milhãmôt for him also becomes suntripsei polemon (Is 42,13). The context portrays the Lord as transforming nature to bring His people back from Babylon; the sea made into dry land at the Exodus is the prototype. What is the meaning of the Lord "crushing wars"? It occurs as early as Os 2,20 : Bow and sword and war I will crush out of the land, and I will let them take their rest in security. It is to be found again in Ps 75 (76), 2-4: God is renowned in Juda; in Israel great is his name. In Salem is his abode; his dwelling is in Sion. There he shattered the flashing shafts of the bow, shield and sword, and weapons of war. This composition is closely related to Ps 45(46) above, and is similarly concerned with the Lord's defense of Jerusalem. In general, it may be said that in all the passages where the Lord puts an end to, or "crushes" wars, He does so by rising to the defense of His people and breaking the force of hostile onslaughts against them. This has been called "pacifist"; but one can apply the word in its modern connotations, only by ignoring much that is basic to Old Testament thought. In Ex 15, the translator who uses suntribõn polemous in v. 3 employs the identical Greek verb in v. 7 to translate hāras, "overthrow, destroy," where the enemy is its object. Not without reason has Ps 75(76) been related to the destruction of the army of Sennacherib: the Lord's terrible rebuke brings the enemy to the sleep of death (vv. 5-10). Jdt is the most explicit of all: the Lord "crushes wars" in both the prose and the poetry by the bloody hand of Judith, and by the subsequent military victory of the Israelites, in which the enemy is slaughtered. Was this turn of phrase, about the crushing of wars, in the original Hebrew of Jdt 9,7 ; 16,2, or is it the work of the translator, leaning on the LXX targum-like treatment in Ex 15? Nothing of the kind seems to appear in the Aramaic targums of Ex. We could perhaps reconcile our- selves to a coincidence : namely, that in Alexandria a translator borrowed for his interpretation of Ex 15,3 a phrase from the same Psalm 45(46)</page><page sequence="12">1963] The Hand of Judith 105 that has thematic contacts also with Jdt; and that the translator of Jdt secondarily supplied that interpretation of Ex where his Hebrew original, which depended on both Ex and Pss, had twice alluded to the 'is milhãmã(h) phrase of Ex, but not, at either place, to the Psalm in question. When, however, we discover that the phrase sôberôt milhãmã(h) occurs in the Mishnah15 in a passage treating of Ex 17,11, we need to have done with coincidences and admit an ancient Palestinian association of the phrase about crushing wars with Ex 15,3 as the occasion for all these various phenomena (including Is 42,13 LXX). But the links between Jdt and Ps 45(46) are not reducible to this single phrase, in any case. In Ps 45 (46), 4-5 God is in the midst of His city because of His holy dwelling, yet His presence there is the active defense of His people. Is 63,8-12.17-18 are a meditation on the presence of the Lord among His people at the time of the Exodus, with a prayer for His active intervention on behalf of His sanctuary which the enemy have overrun : So he became their savior in their every affliction. It was not a messenger or an angel, but he himself who saved them. Where is he who brought up out of the sea the shepherd of his flock? Where is he who put his holy spirit in their midst; Whose glorious arm was the guide at Moses' right; Who divided the waters before them, winning for himself eternal renown .... Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes of your heritage. Why have the wicked invaded your holy place, why have our enemies trampled your sanctuary ? In Jdt, the presence of God for the defense of His people is expressed in lines we have already seen (16,2b-c) : He who set his camp in the people's midst has delivered me from the hand of my persecutors. The divine presence, spoken of as a camp which He set up among His people, would be, in Hebrew: hassām mahanēhu beqereb (am. It harks 15 Rosh haShanah, III, 8. Grintz, op. cit., 143, credits S. Abramson with pointing out to him the connection with the Biblical passages. This Mishnah is discussed below, at the end of this article. Grintz retains 'tš milhāmā(h) as the "original'" in the two Jdt passages.</page><page sequence="13">106 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 25 back to the Yhwh beqirbāh of Ps 45(46),5.15a It owes something to Ps 33(34), 7, hôneh mala'k Yhwh sâbîb līrē'ā(y)w l'hassīlēm. But it also echoes the thought of Is 63,11 hašsām beqirbô 'et-rûah qodsô. The fo titheis en mesQ laou of Jdt and the hassām beqirbô, where people is the antecedent, in Is, argue for a literary connection between the passages. The Isaia passage is a wish that God would renew, at His Jerusalem sanctuary, the wonders of the Exodus. This is made most explicit by Is 64,9-11, which stands as part of the same development: Your holy cities have become a desert, Sion is a desert, Jerusalem a waste. Our holy and glorious temple in which our fathers praised you Has been burned with fire; all that was dear to us is laid waste. Can you hold back, O Lord, after all this? Like Ps 45(46), Jdt avers that God has in fact defended Jerusalem. But there is another point in which Is 63 is noteworthy for our understanding of Jdt; namely, the coupling in 63,12 of Moses, and we may even (see below) say, the right hand of Moses ( lîmîn Mõseh), with the glorious arm of the Lord active in the deliverance at the Sea. 6 . Ex 14-15: Hand of God and Hand of Moses This brings us finally to a consideration of what it is about the Book of Exodus which the author of Jdt found to be a fruitful source for his own reflections. Is it purely and simply the canticle of Ex 15, with its references to the Lord's right hand, which we have already examined in detail? To ask this question is to answer it: as soon as one examines the narrative of the crossing of the Sea in Ex 14, he discovers that there is not merely one, there are four hands engaged. First, there is the "high hand" with which Israel leaves Egypt (Ex 14,8) ; a symbol of victory which occurs but once in the narrative, it is significant for the theme to be found in these chapters, but it is not explicitly alluded to in Jdt. Secondly, there is the hand of Moses. He has been busy with his staff and his hand (with each of which the Lord gave him signs to perform, Ex 4,2-8.17) since Ex 9,8. Several times (9,22-23; 10,12-13; 14,16) both staff and hand are mentioned; in 9,8.10 and 9,29.33, 15a This same imagery of Jerusalem as the "camp of the Lord" (1 Chr 9,19; see the note in BJ) in the midst of His people, on the analogy of His presence in the midst of the desert camp during the Exodus, underlies, in the postexilic period, the whole description of how the gatekeepers for the Temple were disposed on its four sides, 1 Chr 9, 17-27.</page><page sequence="14">1963] The Hand of Judith 107 both hands are employed, in scattering dust, and in prayer. In 10,21-22, the plague of darkness, the hand is referred to alone. In 14,21 we are told, "Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord swept the sea with a strong east wind . . . ." Finally, when the Almighty has prepared the ultimate deliverance of His people from the Egyptians, He says to Moses (14,26), "Stretch out your hand over the sea." "And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea flowed back to its normal depth" (14,27). The third hand (14,30) is contained in the line "And the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians" (cp. Jdt 16,2c, discussed above). Lastly, the fourth hand is the Lorďs. It had been prepared for already in Ex 3,19-20, "I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go out except by strong hand. I will stretch out my hand, therefore, and smite Egypt by doing all kinds of wondrous deeds there." And again in 6,1 ; "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh." Then, taking MT exactly, "By strong hand, he will send them away ; and by strong hand, he will drive them from his land"16 At 13,9 we have "For by strong hand the Lord brought you out of Egypt" ; this backward glance in the festival regulations is repeated in a speech of Moses in Ex 32,11, and becomes part of a running theme in Dt. In Ex 14, however, the Lord's intervention is portrayed by other metaphors: His mighty wind (14,21) ; His glance (14,24). Only in the last verse (14,31) do we have a "hand" which refers to God. This is the verse before the Song, which sums up the prose narrative and gives the setting for the hymn that follows : "When Israel . . . beheld the great hand that the Lord had done against the Egyptians, they feared the Lord and believed in him and in his servant Moses." This last is the only place in the Bible where a wonderful intervention of God is spoken of by the isolated term, "hand," Hebrew yãd . And, as we have seen, the context gives us two hands at work in the accomplishment of the deed in question, Moses' hand, and God's. That the phrase, "this great hand" of Ex 14,31 was not thought in later Judaism to be merely incidental can be demonstrated from the pseudo- Jonathan Targum. At Ex 14,31 it gives geburat yedã taqqíptã as its equivalent for hayyãd haggedôlã(h) of the Hebrew, forging thereby a link with the "strong hand" of Ex 6,1 and 13,9 which we have seen. Then at the end of the Song, for Ex 15,18, where the text is, "The Lord will reign forever and ever," the same Targum resumes the language of 14,31 by way of a 16 Many emend the second "strong hand" to "outstretched arm," as already in LXX, to regain the familiar language of Dt, which is suggested by Ex 3,19 and 6,6.</page><page sequence="15">108 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 25 conclusion, in the words, "When the people, the house of Israel, saw the signs and marvels that the Holy One, praised be His Name, was doing for them at the Sea of Reeds, and the strength of His hand ( ûgebûrat yedēh ), the sons of the exiles [cf. Jdt 4,2; 5,19] said to one another, 'Come, let us set the crown of majesty on the head of our Savior ....'" And for the link between the hand of God and that of Moses in this great event, we can do no better than to turn to the last verses of the Torah (Dt 34,10-12) : "Since then no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face. He had no equal in all the signs and wonders the Lord sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh and all his servants and against all his land, and for the strong hand and the great terror [cf. Dt 4,34; 26,8] which Moses did in the sight of all Israel/' Conclusions The deliberate parallel drawn by Jdt is clear. In Ex, the Almighty hand17 of God uses the hand of Moses as His instrument; in Jdt, the hand of a woman. A long distance has been traversed in the interval, however. Judith's hand is worthy to be the instrument of Goďs providence because the people as a whole is devoted to God alone, and because she has all the carefully nurtured virtues of postexilic Jewish piety: lowliness, peni- tential fasting, chastity, faith and prayer. There is, nevertheless, something yet to be learned. The victory of Judith is interwoven with dreams of that earthbound and militaristic ushering in of God's kingdom, in which the gentiles are treated as the Jews had been treated, which Jesus brushed aside forever as unworthy. As a meditation on the Providence of God, as a Passover haggadah ,17a Judith is magnificent; but when the historical 17 When there is question of what various considerations may have focused attention on the theme of the "hand," it should not be overlooked that the Passover anniversary is fixed for the fourteenth day of the first month, during the evening twilight (Ex 12,6). The number 14 is represented in Hebrew since antiquity by the letters yod-daleth, which also express the word for "hand." 17a The excellent study of Dr. Ernst Haag, "Die besondere literarische Art des Buches Judith und seine theologische Bedeutung," as summarized in Trierer theolo- gische Zeitschrift 71 (1962) 288-301, will be found to complement what has here been said. Dr. Haag's classification (p. 299) for Judith is "freie parabolische Geschichtsdarstellung." He sees in it (ibid.) "Die . . . Funktion einer illustrierenden Beispielserzählung . . . nicht an bestimmte Personen aus der Geschichte anknüpft, sondern an die Geschichte des Gottesvolkes als solche." The present writer would prefer not to use the term parabolische in this connection, lest it leave open an oppor- tunity for begging questions and confusing issues to which no one is currently entitled (cf. CBQ 24, 1962, 147, n. 1; 153, n. 14).</page><page sequence="16">1963] The Hand of Judith 109 reality which it betokens actually came to pass, its aspect was altogether different : Beata Mater, muñere Cujus Supernus Artifex Mundum pugillo continens Ven tris sub arca clausus est. For the lesson of Judith as it might be seen through Jewish eyes, we can do no better than return to the Mishnah passage referred to above ( Rosh haShanah, III, 8) : "As long as Moses kept his hand raised up, Israel had the better of the fight, etc." (Ex 17,11). Were the hands of Moses making war or breaking the hostile attack?18 Rather this is to tell you that every time that Israel were directing their thoughts upward, and keeping their heart subject to their Father who is in heaven, they were prevailing; but if they did not, they were falling. This corresponds to the text in which you say, "Make a saraph and mount it on a pole, and if anyone who has been bitten looks at it, he will recover" (Nb 21,8). Is then a snake slaying, or a snake giving life? [cf. Dt 32,39]. Rather, when Israel were directing their thoughts upward and subjecting their heart to their Father who is in heaven, they were being healed; if they did not, they were being destroyed [cf. Wis 16,11-13]. The narrative of Judith represents a hope, springing from a historically founded faith, rather than an episode; the Mishnah just quoted shows a later Jewish understanding far advanced in the direction confirmed and made definitive by Jesus, as to how that hope might be fulfilled. Patrick Wm. Skehan Catholic University of America Washington , D.C. Postscript: This same theme of the hand of the weak and lowly as the agent of God's purposes and the instrument of His hand in the sal- vation of His people is developed in the War scroll from Qumrân (1QM). In col. xi of this document, which ascribes all victory in war to the Al- mighty, after a reference to the Exodus and another to Goliath ('tš gibbõr hayil hisgartã beyad Dãwíd cabdekã ), we find the following: "From of old you [proclaimed an appointed term] for your mighty hand against the Kittiyim ( yad geburãtekã bakkittiyîm) , saying 'Assyria shall fall by a sword that is not man's : a sword other than human shall devour him' [Is 31,8]. For you will give over the enemies in all lands into the hand 18 This does not conform to the usual rendering of this phrase ( sôberôt milhâmã(h)) ; see n.15 above.</page><page sequence="17">110 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly of the poor, and the hand of those groveling in the dust ( kî beyad ' ebyônîm tasgîr [*ô] yebêkol hä'aräsot , ûbeyad kôi^'ê fãpãr), to bring low the warriors of the peoples, to return the deserts of the wicked upon the heads of . . . The development is in a general context of war against all the enemies of God's people, ending up with acts of judgment against Gog and all his cohorts ( sepãtím begôg ûbekol qehãlô). The theme is alluded to again in 1QM xiii, 13-14, mt kãmôkã bekôlah, 9 El Yisrďěl, we&lt;im 'ebyônîm yad gtyurãPkã, "There is none like you in power, O God of Israel, whose mighty hand is with the poor." The hopelessly belligerent and unrealistic nature of the War scroll need not obscure for us the approach to an understanding of God's Provi- dence which it derives from the Old Testament, or the way in which it merges Pharaoh, Assyria, the Kittiyim (i.e., ultimately the Romans), and the last enemies of Goďs people (Gog), just as Jdt passes from Pharaoh to the Assyrian who is Nabuchodonosor, to Medes and Persians, to finally, "Woe to the nations that rise against my people" (Jdt 16,17).
