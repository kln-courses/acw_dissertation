<plain_text><page sequence="1">Freud, Nietzsche BY LORIN ANDERSON I Freud's reticence regarding the works of Nietzsche has often been brought up and just as quickly dropped. His very silence inhibits enquiry, induces more silence. Since he said little, what is there to say? When Michel Foucault, for example, speaking on Nietzsche, Freud and Marx in the early 1960's, was asked to comment on this problem, he could only confirm that he too had been "struck by the astonishing silence ... of Freud on Nietzsche, even in his correspondence. It is in fact rather enigmatic."1 Something else is striking. Those statements in which Freud does mention Nietzsche are almost invariably accompanied by his frank and cheerful admission that he is ignorant of Nietzsche's thought. In 1908, two meetings of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, a group made up of Freud and his followers, were devoted to discussing Nietzsche. According to the minutes of the first meeting, held in April, Freud began his comments by first emphasizing "his own peculiar relationship to philosophy: its abstract nature is so unpleasant to him, that he has renounced the study of philosophy. He does not know Nietzsche's work: occasional attempts at reading it were smothered by an excess of interest. In spite of the similarities which many people have pointed out, he can give the assurance that Nietzsche's ideas have had no influence whatsoever on his own work." Reaffirming his ignorance at the second meeting in October, "Prof. Freud would like to mention that he has never been able to study Nietzsche, partly because of the resemblance of Nietzsche's intuitive insights to our laborious investigations, and partly because of the wealth of ideas, which has always prevented Freud from 1 Michel Foucault, "Nietzsche, Freud, Marx,** Nietzsche, Cahiers de Royaumont, Philosophic No. VI (Paris: Minuit, 1967), p. 198.

What he says there about the struggle against accepting a distressing piece of reality coincides with my concept of repression so completely that once again I owe the chance of making a discovery to my not being well- read In later years I have denied myself the very great pleasure of reading the works of Nietzsche, with the deliberate object of not being hampered in working out the impressions received in psychoanalysis by any sort of anticipatory ideas. I had therefore to be prepared - and I am so, gladly - to forgo all claims to priority in the many instances in which laborious psychoanalytic investigation can merely confirm the truths which the philosopher recognized by intuition.3 Similarly, in his Autobiographical Study (1925), after again denying any acquaintance with Schopenhauer's philosophy, he added: "Nietzsche, the other philosopher whose premonitions and insights often agree in the most amazing manner with the laborious results of psychoanalysis, I have long avoided for this very reason. After all, I was less concerned about any priority than about the preservation of my openmindedness [ Unbefangenheit]:94 Hence another dimension is added to the enigma: Nietzsche neither spoken of nor read; Nietzsche assiduously avoided. But not for lack of admiration. At one point in his biography of Freud, Ernest Jones presents a list of the men Freud considered great, men he did not rank himself among- "Goethe, Kant, Voltaire, Darwin, Schopenhauer, 2 Herman Nunberg and Ernst Federn, eds., Minutes of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society (New York: International Universities Press, 1962 [Vol. I], 1967 [Vol. II]), I, 359-60; II, 32.

(New York: Random House, 1968), pp. 182-83, note 2.</page><page sequence="3">Freud, Nietzsche 5 Nietzsche."5 At the October meeting of the Vienna Society, Freud had expressed the opinion that "the degree of introspection achieved by Nietzsche had never been achieved by anyone, nor is it likely ever to be reached again." (Minutes, II, 3 1-32.) And to Arnold Zweig, Freud wrote of Nietzsche: "In my youth he signified a nobility to which I could not attain."6 Nietzsche admired and avoided: but in this he was no exception; Schopenhauer was also ignored, as has already been seen. In fact Freud claimed to remain unacquainted with much of the anticipatory literature pertaining to his work. As he explained in a letter to Wilhelm Fliess, "I do not want to read because it stirs up too many thoughts and stints me of the satisfaction of discovery."7 And to a student he wrote in 1909 that he was "really very ignorant about my predecessors. If we ever meet up above they will certainly greet me ill as a plagiarist. But it is such a pleasure to investigate the thing itself instead of reading the literature about it."8 The logic is curious. Even Freud does not seem convinced, as he sketches his imaginary scene of accusations of plagiarism: germane texts shunned for that very reason, Nietzsche avoided precisely to the extent that his insights bear upon the problems confronting psychoanalysis, all in the name of the pleasure of discovery or the preservation of openmindedness. But openmindedness does not require empty- headedness. Behind these explanations is to be seen a conception of originality concerned not so much (at least not entirely) with being the first to think something as with being innocent at the origin, and with remaining pure of thought throughout an investigation. Priorities are then of no account; they may afterwards be lavishly assigned or ignored, depending upon one's mood. With ignorance, discoveries and rediscoveries are equivalent, and even a duplication remains one's own creation. Ignorance assures that one is the father of all one's ideas.9 5 Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud, 3 vols.

(p. 71) As with other statements in the work, this one appears to be more autobiographical than biographical, because Freud must go on, in the same paragraph, to try to explain why Leonardo does not feel this way towards his works. Freud decides that it is because "his father had not cared about him." This work hereafter referred to in the text as Leonardo.</page><page sequence="4">g LORIN ANDERSON When it came to establishing the priority of Freud's own discoveries, however, precedence was of much greater concern. Squabbles over priority, accusations and denials of plagiarism followed Freud throughout his career. And such incidents were accompanied by a complex of related attitudes. Freud's preference for developing his ideas in solitude could be turned into an exaggeration of his actual isolation in order to enhance the sense of his achievement: even Einstein "had the support of a long series of predecessors from Newton onward, while I had to hack every step of my own way through a tangled jungle alone."10 The slow process of development that his ideas underwent from first to final formulation led him to fear that someone else would get wind of them and develop them faster than he could - an ongoing concern, for example, in relation to his pupil, Victor Tausk. He did not appreciate the originality of others when it touched upon his psychoanalytic theories, as was often demonstrated with his followers, whose proper role he viewed as limited to the application of his own original findings. He compared them "with dogs. They take a bone from the table and chew it independently in a corner. But it is my bone!"11 He moreover refused to accept the ideas of others in their original form without first reworking and reformulating them, explaining, "I do not find it easy to feel my way into unfamiliar trains of thought, and generally have to wait until I have found a point of contact with them by way of my own complicated paths."12 But he is also to be found labeling ideas foreign, incomprehensible, or unintelligible at those very points that they draw uncomfortably close to his own. All in all it might be said that Freud suffered from that "autochthonous conceit," to borrow from Nietzsche, of "trying to re-invent the elements of philosophy and science."13 In the course of these evasions, reformulations and suppressions, Freud was inclined to forget Where some of his ideas originated, to appropriate ideas without due acknowledgment, to indiscreetly disclose the ideas of others, put to him in confidence (as in the case of Fliess' theory of bisexuality). Alternately, he would recognize these 10 Letter to Marie Bonaparte, Jan. 11, 1927, trans, in Jones, III, 131. 1 1 Quoted in Paul Roazen, Freud and H is Followers (New York: New American Library, 1974), p. 191, from an interview with Helene Deutsch.

The style of presentation - more than that, Nietzsche's entire approach to and formulation of his psychological "premonitions and insights" - put Freud off. To Nietzsche's nimble intuitions Freud opposed the grave and labored investigations of psychoanalysis: play vs. work. By means of luck and artistic genius, Nietzsche had occasionally danced across the path now being cleared by means of controlled observation and analysis: art vs. science. Just as the shimmering allure of origins, preceding all discoveries of his own and to which he could only add modifications and confirmations, filled Freud with fears of sterility and fatherlessness (there is nothing left to father, all has been fathered already), so also the light-hearted (frivolous) siren of intuitive speculation - of artistic and philosophical thinking in general - threatened in some insidious manner to encroach upon the ponderous edifice being constructed through his scientific enquiries. Consequently the distance between psychoanalysis and philosophy was always to be emphasized. Freud's assurances to his followers present at the first Vienna Society meeting on Nietzsche "that he has renounced the study of philosophy" only agreed with the views of others at the meeting. Edward Hitschmann, who led the evening's discussion, began by making it clear how far he separated himself from philosophy: "... as Moebius did with pyschology, so we could adopt the hopelessness of all philosophy as a theme of discussion, taking the relativity of all philosophy as our point of departure. A philosophical system is a product of an inner urge, not very different from artistic creations Thus a philosopher's subjective views may be determined by his personal characteristics and experiences." {Minutes, I, 355-56, 357.) This theme of the subjectivity of philosophy Freud specifically acknowledged to be one of the most interesting issues raised by Hitschmann. Several years later, he would enlighten Lou Andreas- Salomé on the need to resist "pure philosophy": "it is really essential to 14 Jones adds this insight: "Whereas in his neurological work Freud's bibliographical references had been scrupulously exact and comprehensive, when it came to his analytical writings this was no longer so. Rank once jokingly remarked that Freud distributed references to other analysts' writings on the same principle as the Emperor distributed decorations, according to the mood and fancy of the moment." (II, 41 1-12) Roazen has dealt with the subject matter of this paragraph in Freud and His Followers, pp. 190-202, and passim.

So did his opinion that philosophers who go about questioning the value of life are ill: "The moment one inquires about the sense or value of life one is sick, since objectively neither of them has any existence."17 Nietzsche represented another danger in that his insightfulness threatened to undermine the effort of psychoanalysis to establish itself as a science. How to stop this? By making all philosophical activity suspect, by making philosophers themselves suspect. We have seen Hitschmann's approach. Even less delicate was Isidor Sadger, who "emphasizes that the born philosopher is, by vocation, an obsessional neurotic." (Minutes, I, 357.) Freud, who elsewhere had defined metaphysics as "a projection of so-called endopsychic perceptions," described Nietzsche's perspicacity once again as "endopsychic perception." (Minutes, I, 149; II, 31.) His own insights he would likely have characterized in different terms. Moreover, despite Freud's repeated deference to Nietzsche's intuitive brilliance, this must be measured against his low opinion of intuition; for he elsewhere denied the very existence of intuitive knowledge: "there are no sources of knowledge of the universe other than the intellectual working-over of carefully scrutinized observations - in other words, what we call research - and alongside of it no knowledge derived from revelation, intuition or divination. . . . Intuition and divination . . . may safely be 15 Lou's reconstruction from a conversation at Freud's, February 23, 1913, in The Freud Journal of Lou Andreas-Salomé, ed.

One must reach out and try to grasp this astonishing finesse, that the value of life cannot be estimated. Not by a living man, because he is a party to the dispute, indeed its object, and not the judge of it; not by a dead one, for another reason." Twilight of the Idols, trató. R.J. Hollingdale (Baltimore: Penguin, 1968), "The Problem of Socrates," § 2.</page><page sequence="7">Freud, Nietzsche 9 reckoned as illusions, the fulfilments of wishful impulses."18 Such a statement leaves little doubt as to the status of Nietzsche's "intuitions," or of Freud's own observational labors. Was Nietzsche even to be taken seriously? Those at the Vienna Society meetings were far more interested in determining and assigning the psychological problems that would motivate Nietzsche to write as he did (even when he wrote as a precursor, his "intuited" foreshadowings of the researches of a "scientific discipline" only confirming his troubled nature, suggesting neuroses) than in considering and evaluating the psychological insights offered in the writings under consideration. Could it not be said, at any rate, that such chance ingenuity would scarcely count as discovery until confirmed by science? In a letter to Freud, Arnold Zweig sketched the relationship he perceived between Nietzsche and Freud as follows: To me it seems that you have achieved everything that Nietzsche intuitively felt to be his task, without his being really able to achieve it with his poetic idealism and brilliant inspirations. He tried to explain the birth of tragedy; you have done it in Totem and Taboo. He longed for a world beyond Good and Evil; by means of analysis you have discovered a world to which this phrase actually applies. Analysis has reversed all values, it has conquered Christianity, disclosed the true Antichrist, and liberated the spirit of resurgent life from the ascetic ideal. Analysis has reduced the will to power to what lies at its basis. . . . And thanks to the fact that you are a scientist, and furthermore a psychologist who advances step by step, you have attained what Nietzsche would so gladly have achieved himself: the scientific description and explanation of the 18 Sigmund Freud, New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis ; ed. and trans. James Strachey (New York: Norton, 1964), p. 159. (These lectures were delivered in the winters of 1915-16 and 1916-17.) In the same passage, Freud sets out the relation of psychoanalysis to the scientific Weltanschauung: "As a specialist science . . . [psychoanalysis] is quite unfit to construct a Weltanschauung of its own: it must accept the scientific one." (p. 158) Nevertheless, psychoanalysis is in a position to step in and defend the scientific Weltanschauung, as, e.g., when objections are raised against the view that no other knowledge exists than observational knowledge. "This objection cannot be too energetically repudiated," says Freud. "It is quite without a basis, since the intellect and the mind are objects for scientific research in exactly the same way as any non-human things. Psycho-analysis has a special right to speak for the scientific Weltanschauung at this point, since it cannot be reproached with having neglected what is mental in the picture of the universe. Its contribution to science lies precisely in having extended research to the mental field. And, incidentally, without such a psychology science would be very incomplete." (p. 159)</page><page sequence="8">jQ LORIN ANDERSON human soul- and, more than that, since you are a physician, you have taught and created the possibility of influencing and curing it.» Clearly this comparison reflected certain of Freud's own opinions since, in his reply, he warmly encouraged Zweig to develop it into an essay. Freud had of course been placed in a flattering relation to Nietzsche, in every case made to realize, to formalize, what Nietzsche only sensed. But there is also the manner in which his achievement is characterized; it is the triumph of one approach over another to the same set of problems. Freud had not simply confirmed Nietzsche's solutions, he had reformulated them from within another discipline and answered them by means of a more certain methodology. With sobriety he had reinvented Nietzsche's task. For in this juxtaposition of Freud the scientist and Nietzsche the philosopher, it is the method of the former (observation, analysis) that brings to completion the methodless rampancy of the latter (premonition, intuition). Freud the scientist: yet this fails to account for numerous other statements in which Freud acknowledged an interest in philosophical speculation, or for the philosophical orientation of his own later writings. "As a young man I felt a strong attraction towards speculation and ruthlessly checked it."20 Letters from Freud to his close childhood friend, Edward Silberstein, have recently been turned up which document the extent of Freud's early interest in philosophy. As a prospective student at the University of Vienna, Freud had already determined that he would study philosophy: "About the first year at the university I can tell you that I shall spend it entirely in studying humanistic subjects. ... To this end, I am joining in the first year the faculty of philosophy."21 He became fascinated with Franz Brentano, the only teacher discussed in his letters in any detail. Freud's enthusiasm for Brentano's courses increased through the school year 1874-75, and his career plans accordingly shifted to include philosophy. "I and Paneth have succeeded in establishing closer contact with him," Freud wrote on March 7, 1875. "I shall personally tell you more about this peculiar and in many respects ideal man For the moment only this: 19 Ernst Freud, ed., The Letters of Sigmund Freud and Arnold Zweig (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1970), pp. 23-24. 20 Jones, I, 29. 21 Letter of July 11, 1873, trans, in H.

A week later Freud met with him. "Brentano thought it would be quite possible and very good to graduate in philosophy and in medicine. This would not be the first case. Lotze did the same and remained subsequently a philosopher."22 Freud did not follow through with this plan, but he did not repudiate philosophy either. "Philosophy," he wrote his fiancée in 1882, "which I have always pictured as my goal and refuge in old age, gains everyday in attraction, as do human affairs altogether or any cause to which I could give my devotion at all costs, but the fear of the supreme uncertainty of all political and local matters keeps me from that sphere."23 Instead he went into medicine, but "neither at that time, nor indeed in my later life, did I feel any particular predilection for the career of a doctor."24 Having chosen a safe career, he refused to give up his earlier interests. As he wrote Fliess in 1896, "I secretly nurse the hope of arriving by the same route [medicine] at my own original objective, philosophy. For that was my original ambition . . ." And later that year he reiterated this hope to Fliess with greater confidence: "When I was young, the only thing I longed for was philosophical knowledge, and now that I am going over from medicine to psychology I am in the process of obtaining it."25 In later years, looking back upon his career, Freud reflected that "after forty-one years of medical activity, my self-knowledge tells me that I have never really been a doctor in the proper sense. I became a doctor through being compelled to deviate from my original purpose; and the triumph of my life lies in my having, after a long and roundabout journey, found my way back to my earliest path."26 In 1924 he set out 1920 as the date after which "I have given free rein to the inclination which I kept down for so long to speculation . . ."27But even earlier, "as far back as in 1910," Ernest Jones recalls "his expressing the wish with a sign that he could retire from medical practice and devote himself to the unraveling of cultural and historical problems - ultimately the great problem of how man came to be what he is."28 In the 1920's, in any case, 22 Letter of March 15, 1875, both letters trans, in ibid., p. 200. 23 Letter of Aug. 16, 1882, trans, in Jones, III, 41. 24 Sigmund Freud, An Autobiographical Study, trans.

Did Freud consider himself a philosopher or not? A philosopher or a scientist? Upon this matter, his study of Leonardo da Vinci provides some suggestive commentary. Of all the possible traits in Leonardo's personality affecting his development, Freud singled out what he described as "Leonardo's double nature as an artist and as a scientific investigator . . ." {Leonardo, p. 23.) For Leonardo, the "vacillation between art and science" (p. 84) not only marks off the successive stages of his life but actually determines them, dialectically advancing his career through three distinct periods. In Freud's view, the period of science and research activity, which followed Leonardo's longer first period of carefree artistic activity, "represented the latest and highest expansion of his personality." (pp. 78-79, 15) Freud had it arise necessarily out of the first period by following Solmi's argument that Leonardo's research interests began in the service of art, "in order to ensure mastery in the imitation of nature . . ." (p. 26) However, in "following the lead given by the requirements of his painting," Leonardo moved further and further afield from the study of his subjects (plants, animals, human body) - from the exterior of bodies (study of ligjit, shadows, perspective) to their interior (study of internal structure and vital functions), and then beyond them into the laws of mechanics and all the branches of natural science - so that "finally the instinct, which had become so overwhelming, swept him away until the connection with the demands of his art was severed . . ." (p. 26) Consequently, when Leonardo tried (third period) to bring these investigative powers back to focus once more on his art, "he found himself disturbed by the new direction of his interests and the changed nature of his mental activity." (p. 27) Through all this it is hard to forget Freud's opening image of Leonardo, reproaching himself on his deathbed for having failed his duty to art by redirecting his interests too exclusively to science. Leonardo's researches, begun as a means of emancipating his art, in the end caused him to feel constrained, to become lost in the inexhaustible number of problems that he now saw to lie behind the premise of a truly representative painting, to paint less and less, to care less and less about the fate of his paintings, to leave his paintings all unfinished (or at least to declare them unfinished in light of what a totally representative 29 In the "1935 Postscript" to the Autobiographical Study, Freud describes the "significant change" with careful precision, (see esp. pp. 132-133.)</page><page sequence="11">Freud, Nietzsche 13 expression might encompass). "The artist had once taken the investigator into his service to assist him; now the servant had become the stronger and suppressed his master." (p. 27) It hardly need be mentioned that the progression from art to science to art bears a striking resemblance to Freud's own progression from philosophy to science to philosophy, or that the ambivalent "double nature," considered by Freud to be so significant for an understanding of Leonardo resembles his own ambivalence. Freud was well into his science period when he wrote of Leonardo, and, in line with his analysis, he had early on attempted to see this period as an extension of the first, as the continuation and even attainment of his philosophical objectives by another means. Composed in 1909-10, the essay appeared just about the time, according to Jones, that Freud had begun wishing "he could retire from medical practice and devote himself to the unraveling of cultural and historical problems," about the time, that is, that Freud began anticipating his own "final period" in a return to philosophical reflection. By studying Leonardo, Freud had an opportunity to reflect upon problems of concern to him. Through Leonardo he could examine originality and creativity; and again the theme appears of creativity stymied at the hand of knowledge that, although (or because) it enlightens, does not serve one well. By means of the study - itself creative, insightful, speculative- Freud was also able to explore his own unresolved "double nature." If in Leonardo it led to a rather melancholy conclusion, this perhaps only confirmed Freud's own conflicting views, prefiguring, if anything, the ambiguity with which he was to regard his return to philosophy and the status of the later speculative writings.30 Whatever the reason, his book on Leonardo must have spoken to Freud directly, for, among his own works, it was one of his favorites.31 But what of Nietzsche? Has he been lost sight of? And if not, what do we conclude? Do we know now who Nietzsche is to Freud? Or is it a question that, finally, must remain unresolved, enigmatic - a question that disappears into complex and ambiguous eddies whenever we try to pursue Freud's thoughts and explanations? Perhaps that is so, which does not mean we have come up empty-handed. Perhaps beyond this point we are left with speculative answers. We do still have, at any rate, a 30 This return was not always seen as a "triumph"; he sometimes regretted leaving psychology and could be extremely severe in his evaluation of his later writings.

The letter was written late in Freud's life, in July 1934, long after he had given "free reign" to his speculative inclinations, and it refers to none of the excuses with which he generally pardoned himself. Instead he wrote, "it is impossible to understand anyone without showing his sexual constitution, and Nietzsche's is a complete enigma. There is even a story that he was a passive homosexual and that he contracted syphilis in a male brothel in Italy."32 Particularly striking in this explanation is not so much the fact that it tends to cancel the others (which indicate that Nietzsche is understood all too well), since Freud seems to have in mind more the difficulty of understanding Nietzsche's personality than his writings, but that once again, and in a rather ultimate way, Nietzsche has been deemed impenetrable. Yet Freud had felt quite free to argue the significance of Leonardo's sexuality to his life and his work with information at least as inadequate as he had available on Nietzsche.33 Where Leonardo can be discussed, Nietzsche cannot. The rules guiding the permissibility and the field of discussion are reversed: a certain symmetrically inverted bond links the book on Leonardo to the silence on Nietzsche. Now the one subject that seems to encompass these opposing reactions is Freud's self-doubt. To suppress Nietzsche is to suppress an area of uncertainty and insecurity touching nearest upon his estimation of himself as a creative thinker and writer, uncertainty as to his originality, uncertainty as to whether he had in fact found the adequate field and best means of venting his creativity. To study Leonardo is to explore this area, but at a safe distance. Nietzsche stands too close, however, in time, in his interests, in his formulations. As Paul Federn expressed it at one of the meetings on Nietzsche: "Nietzsche has come so 32 Freud-Zweig Letters, p. 85. This story was repeatedly brought up at the Vienna Society meetings on Nietzsche, and provided the basis for much speculation about Nietzsche. Freud himself passed the information off as immaterial," even if true, but then went on to make comments on Nietzsche's personality and even on the nature of his investigations and insights that take his homosexuality for granted and as a determining factor: "Then one sees how, in his life, illness becomes his fate. . . . Completely cut off from life by illness, he turns to the only object of investigation that is still accessible to him and which, in any event, is close to him as a homosexual, i.e., the ego." 33 Freud had also added, at the Vienna Society meeting: "The lack of understanding of Nietzsche may be due to the fact that there really is something un-German in his nature. We just have not succeeded in understanding Nietzsche's personality." Minutes, p. 30. It is doubtful that Freud meant to imply that only Germanic personalities could be understood by psychoanalysis. In any case, Leonardo certainly was not "Germanic," a fact about which Freud did not complain.</page><page sequence="13">Freud, Nietzsche 15 close to our views that we can ask only, 'Where has he not come close?'" {Minutes, I, 359.) Nietzsche's anticipations threaten to turn Freud into a verifying drudge (although Zweig knows how to turn confirmations into the significant achievements). Freud refuses to compete with Nietzsche; nor does he care to use him, to "stand on his shoulders." Instead, he barricades himself against Nietzsche's stylus. Nietzsche is not to be spoken of, not to be read. For Freud might find he has only been plodding along the path on which Nietzsche once playfully sang and danced. And intuited his intuitions. II Just how well acquainted Freud was with Nietzsche, how much of Nietzsche's work he read and what use he made of what he read: these are matters about which Freud has little to say, and it may well have been them, rather than the works of Nietzsche, that he wished to suppress. Were it not for the survival of a few letters and the publication of the Vienna Society meetings- material, that is to say, only gradually brought to light since Freud's death- evidence of Freud's familiarity with Nietzsche's thought would have disappeared virtually without a trace. For Freud's part, the effacement of his past was scarcely accidental. Consider the following passage from a letter of Freud's to his fiancée, dated April 28, 1885: "I destroyed all my notes and letters accumulated for 14 years, all scientific abstracts and manuscripts of my work; only some family letters have been spared. All my old friendships and relations presented themselves again and silently took the deadly blow. ... I cannot mature and cannot die, worrying about who will lay their hands on my old papers. The biographers should work it out somehow, we don't want to make it too easy for them."34 Freud's timing here is as curious as the drastic nature of this scorched-document policy itself, since in 1885 he was still unpublished and unknown. Already he appears bent on covering his tracks, on perpetuating the myth that he was ill-read, that he had created in a void, that he was unprecedented, that his achievement represented the highest sort of genius and creativity.35 But Freud read Nietzsche. He did not actually deny that he had. What he denied was that he had read very much of him, or that he had been 34 Sigmund Freud, Letters, 1873-1939, ed. Ernest and Lucie Freud, 2nd ed. (Frankfurt, 1968), pp. 144-45. 35 See John Gedo and George Pollock, eds., Freud: The Fusion of Science and Humanism (New York: International Universities Press, 1976), pp. 12, 239 note 2.</page><page sequence="14">16 LORIN ANDERSON influenced in any way by what he read. At a Vienna Society meeting he had confessed to being unable to read more than half a page or so from a work by Nietzsche without having to stop. Yet various reasons suggest that his knowledge of Nietzsche extended beyond the contents of a few half-pages. For a start, how could Freud have known that many of Nietzsche's ideas agreed with the results of psychoanalysis unless he was aware of the contents of those ideas? The very fact that two meetings of the Vienna Society were dedicated to Nietzsche - and more specifically to two of his books - would indicate an already existing familiarity, by the participants, with the importance of Nietzsche to psychoanalysis; and this is borne out by the discussions. Freud's disciples do not appear so unacquainted with Nietzsche as Freud himself professed to be. Adler "stresses that among all great philosophers who have left something for posterity, Nietzsche is closest to our way of thinking." (Minutes, 1, 358.) Federn, Friedman and Frey offer some examples: "he was the first to discover the significance of abreaction, of repression, of flight into illness, of the instincts - the normal sexual ones as well as the sadistic instincts"; "the significance of forgetting, of the ability to forget; or the fact that he regards illness as an excessive sensitivity to life, and so forth." (I, 359; II, 29) Throughout this, as one would expect, Freud does not seem less knowledgeable than his students. To Federn's query, "Where has [Nietzsche] not come close?" Freud had, for example, a quick (if perhaps somewhat defensive) reply: "Nietzsche failed to recognize infantilism as well as the mechanism of displacement." (1, 360) Later on, he countered claims of neuroses in Nietzsche with the assertion that "there is no evidence whatsoever of a neurotic illness." (II, 31) Such responses suggest familiarity with Nietzsche - as they should, for Freud's connections with Nietzsche's works, when tallied, reveal a remarkably long and continuous history. The Silberstein correspondence, which has demonstrated the seriousness of Freud's youthful philosophical interests, also shows the seventeen-year-old Freud already, in his first year at the University of Vienna, quite familiar with Nietzsche's published work.36 Between 1873 and 1877 Freud was a member of the Leseverein der deutschen Studenten, a reading society of young German nationalists who, in the 1870's, "saw in the movement toward pan-Germanism closer links with the culture of Goethe as well as a more genuine expression of their 36 Ibid. Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy was first published in 1872.</page><page sequence="15">Freud, Nietzsche 17 political identity."37 Taking Schopenhauer, Wagner and Nietzsche as their inspirational leaders, they regarded past political activity as excessively rational in its appeals, and as insufficiently concerned with man's emotional, creative and artistic side. The group's members became politically radicalized through their enthusiasm over German culture and shared dreams of overturning the "stable bourgeois world of their liberal fathers."38 One leading participant in the reading society, Heinrich Braun, had been a close friend of Freud's in their Gymnasium days and, at that time, had "aroused a number of revolutionary feelings" in him.39 "In 1877 Braun was one of the joint signers of a letter to Nietzsche declaring devotion to his outlook and offering to follow in the wake of his criticism of liberal society."40 Another of Freud's friends, Josef Paneth, with whom he studied philosophy and attended Brentano's lectures in 1874-75, reappears a little later as a direct link to Nietzsche. Paneth met Nietzsche in Nizza and spent a good deal of time with him between December 26, 1883 and March 26, 1884. No doubt assured that Freud would be interested, he was thoughtful enough to keep Freud informed of his impressions of Nietzsche. Freud makes a reference to this to Zweig in 1 934: "A friend of mine, Dr. Paneth, had got to know him in the Engadine and he used to write me a lot about him."41 The young Freud was thus aware of Nietzsche virtually from the moment his first book was published. Whether Freud continued to read Nietzsche in the last decades of the 19th century is unknown. But he did receive Paneth's letters in 1 884. And in 1900 he again apparently took up his study of Nietzsche, for in a letter to Fliess in February ofthat year, Freud acknowledged having just purchased the works of Nietzsche, "Where I hope to find words for much that remains mute within me."42 "In later years," Freud had written in his History of the Psycho- Analytic Movement (1914), "I have denied myself the very great pleasure of reading the works of Nietzsche." But what is meant by "later years "? Freud acquired Nietzsche's works in 1900 with the intent of reading them. He read and discussed Nietzsche in 1908 at the Vienna Society meetings: those who attended the first meeting on Nietzsche 37 Harry Trosman, "Freud's Cultural Background," in ibid., p. 58. 38 Quoted in ibid. 39 Letters of Sigmund Freud, p. 379. 40 Trosman, p. 58. 41 Letter of May 11, 1934, trans, in Jones, III, 460. 42 Quoted in Max Schur, Freud: Living and Dying (New York: International Universities Press, 1972), p. 202.</page><page sequence="16">Ig LORIN ANDERSON presumably had read in preparation at least the third essay of the Genealogy of Morals, and likely had read or perused the first two essays also, while those who attended the second meeting presumably had read Ecce Homo, From 1912 on, another direct tie to Nietzsche was established when Lou Andreas-Salomé came to Vienna to study with Freud. Her knowledge of Nietzsche's thought, both from their discussions together and from her reading of his works (she had published Friedrich Nietzsche in seinen Werken in 1894), made her a valuable source of information on Nietzsche. And a source readily approached, since she and Freud quickly formed a friendship that endured until Lou's death in 1937. Shortly after her death, Freud "described her as the only real bond between Nietzsche and himself ."43 As a result of this somewhat tedious recitation of evidence - made necessary in view of Freud's own misleading statements and equally misleading lapses - I think it is necessary to conclude that there is no more reason to take at their face value Freud's professions of ignorance concerning Nietzsche's writings than his claims to have not been well- read in the relevant philosophical literature. Otto Rank was not taking such disclaimers seriously when, for Freud's seventieth birthday, he sent him an expensive edition of Nietzsche's works. As Roazen writes, "On the surface the present was loyal and humble, and yet it also meant that Rank was emphasizing a predecessor and anticipator of Freud's. It was as if Rank's gift were saying, 'you accuse me of taking from you when look what you have taken from Nietzsche.'"44 This brings us to the more interesting issue, which is not simply what Freud knew of Nietzsche's thought but what he did with what he knew. Nietzsche's "intuited anticipations" of Freud's psychoanalytic "discoveries" were pointed out by Freud's followers and admitted by Freud himself. Rather than continuing here with additional comparisons in that area, let us take another approach and compare a work of Freud's with one of Nietzsche's - not a psychoanalytic work, but one from Freud's later speculative period where he has turned his attention to broader cultural problems. Let us look at the central ideas of Civilization and Its Discontents (1930) and, following that, at some passages from Nietzsche's analysis of bad conscience in the Genealogy of Morals (1887), two works dealing with the foundations and functions of civilization. 43 Letter of February 11, 1937, quoted in Jones, III, 213. 44 Freud and His Followers, p. 412.</page><page sequence="17">Freud, Nietzsche 19 Freud argues that civilization is premised upon a trade: protection against nature, the regulation of social relationships, and order in exchange for a sacrifice of instincts, of individual freedom. Perhaps we may begin by explaining that the element of civilization enters on the scene with the first attempt to regulate these social relationships. If the attempt were not made, the relationships would be subject to the arbitrary will of the individ- ual. . . . Human life in common is only made possible when a majority comes together which is stronger than any separate individual and which remains united against all separate individuals. The power of this community is then set up as "right" in opposition to the power of the individual, which is condemned as "brute force." This replacement of the power of the individual by the power of a community constitutes the decisive step of civilization. The essence of it lies in the fact that the members of the community restrict themselves in their possibilities of satisfaction, whereas the individual knew no such restrictions The liberty of the individual is no gift of civilization.45 Society's formation, in effect, shifts the nature of human suffering away from arbitrary subjugations, oppressions and elemental forces towards a frustrating economy of privation; for the instincts, which previously had free reign, are modified under this new order: they are displaced into activities useful to the development of culture, or they are simply repressed. Unsuited to civilization, their renunciation is demanded. Such, for example, is the fate of the sexual instinct, permitted to operate in civilization, but only under hobbled and carefully regulated circumstances. Such is the fate, too, of the aggressive instinct, here introduced by Freud as an innate and enduring anticultural inclination. Why has this instinct taken so long to discover? Violence, cruelty, wars and dominations do not occur all that rarely. Freud answers that aggression has not been so difficult to find as to face up to- which, now that it has been exposed, we are challenged to do: The element of truth behind all this, which people are so ready to disavow, is that men are not gentle creatures who want to be loved, and who at the most can defend themselves if they are attacked; they are, on the contrary, creatures among whose instinctual 45 Sigmund Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, ed. James Strachey (New York: Norton, 1962), p. 42. Hereafter referred to in the text as Civilization.</page><page sequence="18">20 LORIN ANDERSON endowments is to be reckoned a powerful share of aggressiveness. As a result, their neighbour is for them not only a potential helper or sexual object, but also someone who tempts them to satisfy their aggressiveness on him, to exploit his capacity for work without compensation, to use him sexually without his consent, to seize his possessions, to humiliate him, to cause him pain, to torture and to kill him. Homo homini lupus. Who, in face of all his experience of life and of history, will have the courage to dispute this assertion? {Civilization, p. 58.) An "aggressive cruelty," repressed but patient and ever-prepared, thus awaits provocation or excuse to burst forth. "In consequence of this primary mutual hostility of human beings, civilized society is perpetually threatened with disintegration." (p. 59) It is on this point that Paul Ricoeur finds the significant turn in Freud's analysis; for here Freud reintroduced Thanatos, the death wish, at the level of culture, identified as a primordial hostility of man towards man. The essay that, prior to this, had been advancing "with calculated ease,"46 suddenly confronts the tragedy of culture. Says Freud, "This aggressive instinct is the derivative and the main representative of the death instinct which we have found alongside of Eros and which shares world-domination with it. And now, I think, the meaning of the evolution of civilization is no longer obscure to us. It must present the struggle between Eros and Death, between the instinct of life and the instinct of destruction, as it works itself out in the human species." (p. 69) To Freud, however, even more important than his announcement of man's fundamentally aggressive character was his insight that the repression of aggression gives rise to a "sense of guilt," and that guilt becomes the means by which civilization inhibits and controls aggression: "What happens in [the individual] to render his desire for aggression innocuous? Something very remarkable, which we should never have guessed and which is nevertheless quite obvious. His aggressiveness is introjected, internalized; it is, in point of fact, sent back to where it came from- that is, it is directed toward his own ego. . . . Civilization, therefore, obtains mastery over the individual's dangerous desire for aggression by weakening and disarming it and by setting up an agency within him to watch over it, like a garrison in a conquered city." (pp. 70-71) Not until authority has been internalized 46 Paul Ricoeur, Freud and Philosophy (New Haven: Yale, 1970), p. 303.</page><page sequence="19">Freud, Nietzsche 21 and the super-ego constituted can we properly speak of a sense of guilt or of "bad conscience," for only then is "conscience" actually established. Guilt establishes itself in two stages, the aggressive instinct being renounced at first out of fear of external authority, and then, following the erection of conscience, out of fear of an internal authority. Once established, however, "Every renunciation of instinct now becomes a dynamic source of conscience and every fresh renunciation increases the latter's severity and intolerance." (p. 75) Its force deflected through guilt, aggression no longer seeks external release but turns back remorselessly upon the individual. Civilization maintained through the reinforcement of guilt - Freud saw this as the central insight of his book: "I suspect that the reader has the impression that our discussions on the sense of guilt disrupt the framework of this essay. . . . This may have spoilt the structure of my paper; but it corresponds faithfully to my intention to represent the sense of guilt as the most important problem in the development of civilization . . ." (p. 81) One final point before turning to Nietzsche. Years before, in his account of the murder of the primal father {Totem and Taboo, 1913), Freud had already introduced the connection of guilt and civilization. In Freud's myth, a group of sons, tired of the father's monopoly over the women of the primitive horde, banded together, killed and devoured the father. These supremely antisocial crimes led directly to the origin of society and to the renunciation of instinctual gratification: in part because none of the sons were powerful enough to step into the father's place and acquire his absolute rights, but especially because of the guilt felt by the sons over the commitment of their crimes against the father. In Civilization and Its Discontents, however, guilt is no longer restricted to a myth of origins (a thing of the past). As the active mechanism by which civilization maintains itself, it has been given a creative and on-going role. Freud has redefined guilt. "When one has a sense of guilt after having committed a misdeed, and because of it, the feeling should more properly be called remorse. It relates only to a deed that has been done. . . . Psycho-analysis is thus justified in excluding from the present discussion the case of a sense of guilt due to remorse, however frequently such cases occur and however great their practical importance. But if the human sense of guilt goes back to the killing of the primal father, that was after all a case of 'remorse.'" (pp. 78-79) It is not by accident that the primal father myth is played down in this new essay on civilization. Freud himself is aware that he has changed the definition of guilt.</page><page sequence="20">22 LORIN ANDERSON Nietzsche, too, examined guilt ("bad conscience" is the term he prefers) in the "Second Essay" of the Genealogy of Morals*1 How did "the consciousness of guilt, the 'bad conscience,' come into the world?" {Genealogy, II, § 4.) This is the question that directs the essay, and several preliminary hints are provided as Nietzsche prepares us for his own hypothesis: "its beginnings were, like the beginnings of everything great on earth, soaked in blood thoroughly and for a long time." (§ 6) Nietzsche then reminds us that already, in Beyond Good and Evil (§229), and earlier in Dawn (§§ 18, 77, 1 13), "I pointed cautiously to the ever-increasing spiritualization and 'deification' of cruelty which permeates the entire history of higher culture (and in a significant sense actually constitutes it)." (§ 6) Another hint. Supposedly punishment possesses "the value of awakening ihs feeling of guilt in the guilty person ..."(§ 14) But that crudely misunderstands human psychology, as can readily be observed by walking into any prison: "It is precisely among criminals and convicts that the sting of conscience is extremely rare; prisons and penitentiaries are not the kind of hotbed in which this species of gnawing worm is likely to flourish . . ." (§ 14) So, once again, where do these feelings come from? At this point I can no longer avoid giving a first, provisional statement of my own hypothesis concerning the origin of the "bad conscience": it may sound rather strange and needs to be pondered, lived with, and slept on for a long time. I regard the bad conscience as the serious illness that man was bound to contract under the stress of the most fundamental change he ever experienced - that change which occurred when he found himself finally enclosed within the walls of society and of peace. The situation that faced sea animals when they were compelled to become land animals or perish was the same as that which faced those semi-animals, well adapted to the wilderness, to war, to prowling, to adventure: suddenly all their instincts were dis valued and "suspended." From now on they had to walk on their feet and "bear themselves" whereas hitherto they had been borne by the water: a dreadful heaviness lay upon them. They felt unable to cope with the simplest undertakings; in this new world they no longer possessed their former guides, their regulating, unconscious and infallible drives: they were reduced to thinking, inferring, reckoning, co-ordinating 47 Entitled: '"Guilt/ 'Bad Conscience,' and the Like," On the Genealogy of Morals, trans. Walter Kaufmann (New York: Random House, 1967). Hereafter referred to in the text as Genealogy.</page><page sequence="21">Freud, Nietzsche 23 cause and effect, these unfortunate creatures; they were reduced to their "consciousness," their weakest and most fallible organ! I believe there has never been such a feeling of misery on earth, such a leaden discomfort - and at the same time the old instincts had not suddenly ceased to make their usual demands! Only it was hardly or rarely possible to humor them: as a rule they had to seek new and, as it were, subterranean gratifications. All instincts that do not discharge themselves outwardly turn inward- this is what I call the internalization [Verinner lichung] of man: thus it was that man first developed what was later called his "soul." The entire inner world, originally as thin as if it were stretched between two membranes, expanded and extended itself, acquired depth, breadth, and height, in the same measure as outward discharge was inhibited. Those fearful bulwarks with which the political organization protected itself against the old instincts of freedom - punishments belong among these bulwarks - brought about that all those instincts of wild, free, prowling man turned backward against man himself. Hostility, cruelty, joy in persecuting, in attacking, in change, in destruction - all this turned against the possessors of such instincts: that is the origin of the "bad conscience." . . . But thus began the gravest and uncanniest illness, from which humanity has not yet recovered, man's suffering of man, of himself- the result of a forcible sundering from his animal past, as it were a leap and plunge into new surroundings and conditions of existence, a declaration of war against the old instincts upon which his strength, joy, and terribleness had rested hitherto. Let us add at once that, on the other hand, the existence on earth of an animal soul turned against itself, taking sides against itself, was something so new, profound, unheard of, enigmatic, contradictory, and pregnant with a future that the aspect of the earth was essentially altered. (§ 16) All the important themes of Civilization and Its Discontents are present here, deployed in the same manner, established in the same relationship to one another. Internalization and bad conscience are even introduced in a similar manner: "Something very remarkable, which we should never have guessed," says Freud; "it may sound rather strange and needs to be pondered, lived with, and slept on for a long time," says Nietzsche. If there is any difference, it is in the extent of the change brought by civilization: for Nietzsche the internalization of instincts institutes the</page><page sequence="22">24 LORIN ANDERSON most profound sort of transformation and rupture with the past; and if such great changes have occurred once in human history, then the possibility is open to greater future changes than Freud foresees, "as if man were not a goal but only a way, an episode, a bridge, a great promise. - " That is how Nietzsche ends the section. As for the origin of civilization, both Freud and Nietzsche reject a uniformitarian line of gradual change and are able to account for its advent only by means of violent events. This is Nietzsche's account: Among the presuppositions of this hypothesis concerning the origin of the bad conscience is, first, that the change referred to was not a gradual or voluntary one and did not represent an organic adaptation to new conditions but a break, a leap, a compulsion, an ineluctable disaster which precluded all struggle and even all ressentiment. Secondly, however, that the welding of a hitherto unchecked and shapeless populace into a firm form was not only instituted by an act of violence but also carried to its conclusion by nothing but acts of violence- that the oldest "state" thus appeared as a fearful tyranny, as an oppressive and remorseless machine . . . ... I think that sentimentalism which would have [the "state"] begin with a "contract" has been disposed of. He who can command, he who is by nature "master," he who is violent in act and bearing- what has he to do with contracts! One does not reckon with such natures; they come like fate, without reason, consideration, or pretext; they appear as lightning appears, too terrible, too sudden, too convincing, too "different" even to be hated. Their work is an instinctive creation and imposition of forms. . . . They do not know what guilt, responsibility, or consideration are, these born organizers; they exemplify that terrible artists' egoism that has the look of bronze and knows itself justified to all eternity in its "work," like a mother in her child. It is not in them that the "bad conscience" developed, that goes without saying- but it would not have developed without them, this ugly growth, it would be lacking if a tremendous quantity of freedom had not been expelled from the world, or at least from the visible world, and made as it were latent under their hammer blows and artists' violence. This instinct for freedom forcibly made latent - we have seen it already- this instinct for freedom pushed back and repressed, incarcerated within and finally able to discharge and vent itself only on itself: that, and that alone, is what the bad conscience is in its beginnings. (§ 17)</page><page sequence="23">Freud, Nietzsche 25 Freud envisages civilization's origin in the carrying out of unspeakable crimes, followed by a hasty and self-imposed contract. Guilt is democratically distributed; the founders of social order are the first to experience remorse and self-renunciation. No one is noble. For Nietzsche, too, nobility has long since been debased and lost in the bad conscience, the resentments and the decadence that civilization cultivates; but its existence at the origin, in the founders themselves, again holds out the hope of a different future, a future with promise. For Freud, guilt and renunciation are the necessary price of stability and order, the only alternative being reversion to a more or less Hobbesian natural state: either the present compromise or retrogression, that is the threat. For Nietzsche, however, bad conscience itself may be preparing the way out. "The bad conscience is an illness, there is no doubt about that, but an illness as pregnancy is an illness." (§ 19) The intrinsically active nature of bad conscience is not to be underestimated . Through the modifications it carries out, there may still be, "as the womb of all ideal and imaginative phenomena, also brought to light an abundance of strange new beauty and affirmation, and perhaps beauty itself." (§ 18) The present is a passing state, the future pregnant with possibility - and that too is a threat, but one which Nietzsche embraces and affirms. He affirms the human adventure, and even every possibility within man that makes man tremble and renounce himself. That is to suggest the difference in the analyses of Freud and Nietzsche, a difference in their assessment of the future of civilization. But as to a description of its present condition, who can deny the remarkable correlation of terms and themes in these two works? More than that, it is precisely the most "novel" and important aspects of Civilization and Its Discontents that bring it into alignment with the Genealogy of Morals. Freud had weighed the question of man's inherent aggressiveness before; now, by accepting it as an innate and independent instinct, aggression becomes the archetype of suppressed instincts (it being the antisocial instinct par excellence). But how is it that individuals would tolerate so complete an instinctual suppression as occurs in the case of aggression - so total its very existence is hidden? A problem that brings Freud to a reassessment of guilt, to internalization and guilt, to the rest of Nietzsche's analysis: guilt is no longer identified as the effect of civilization's original sin, but as the means of its ongoing inhibition of aggression. Reader of Nietzsche, borrower from Nietzsche - Freud, Nietzsche's secret disciple. No reference to Nietzsche appears in Civilization and Its Discontents. Why Freud's reticence? But rather than that question</page><page sequence="24">26 LORIN ANDERSON again, let's ask another: why everyone else's reticence as well? Nietzsche's analysis of bad conscience is, after all, a well-known text, perhaps as well known as Freud's, and known often enough by the same readers. If this latter analysis is based upon some rather obvious appropriations from the former, how is it that this is passed over in silence, not just by Freud, but by all those who, familiar with both, are willing to acquiesce in Freud's authoritative elision of Nietzsche's name, and to concede the originality of Freud's repetition? The themes of Civilization and Its Discontents are linked, not to Nietzsche, but back to the authority of Freud's psychoanalytic "science." The conclusions drawn concerning civilization are offered as extrapolations from the discoveries of psychoanalysis. Freud's studies of the individual have placed him in a privileged position from which to speculate on cultural aggression, repression, guilt, and finally - positing a super-ego for civilization analogous to that of the individual - to raise the question of cultural neuroses. . . . there is one question which I can hardly evade. If the development of civilization has such a far-reaching similarity to the development of the individual and if it employs the same methods, may we not be justified in reaching the diagnosis that, under the influence of cultural urges, some civilizations, or some epochs of civilization- possibly the whole of mankind - have become "neurotic"? An analytic dissection of such neuroses might lead to therapeutic recommendations which could lay claim to great practical interest. I would not say that an attempt of this kind to carry psycho-analysis over to the cultural community was absurd or doomed to be fruitless. (Civilization, p. 91.) Freud offers us his own science as the basis for his speculations, and he envelops these speculations in a language that is sober, authoritative, clinical. As he sits before civilization, that vast subject, diagnosing symptoms, considering treatment, he defers only to himself; he is his own authority; no one qualified has sat there before. Who dares to question him? Nietzsche is silently transcribed. Freud, Nietzsche's secret disciple, barricades himself against Nietzsche's style through the solemnity of his psychoanalytic "science." To Zweig it constituted Freud's triumph. Rank had his doubts. For Nietzsche it would have meant only a relapse into the very prejudices, shallowness and metaphysical assumptions of science and scholarship that he had already exposed, and against which he had unleashed his</page><page sequence="25">Freud, Nietzsche 27 style in the festive radiance of his rhetoric. Nietzsche is not serious. What is signified by the seriousness of scientific expression? Is seriousness more "scientific"? Does science provide a more "serious" explanation? All this "seriousness imprinted on faces and gestures" denotes, rather, the sign of something else- that "modern science" 'does not oppose religion at all, but has assumed its place as "the best ally the ascetic ideal has at present." {Genealogy, III, § 25.) Seriousness is the visage of asceticism- of its voluntary deprivation, its self-denial - and nothing today is more serious than science. We find this serious expression fixed on the faces of all those scholars today who would align themselves with the prestige of science. Behind this visage is to be found a deeper association of science with religion, in the metaphysical faith both share in truth: in the unquestioned assumption that truth exists, that its value is absolute, and that it exists, not as the successful imposition of one particular interpretation, but in itself, preceding us and awaiting our discovery of it. Truth is to be "discovered" and protected against all other interpretations. Faith in truth: this was "the Christian faith, which was also Plato's, that God is truth, that truth is divine" {Genealogy, III, § 24.)48 Now it is the faith of science, and it is this faith that forms the metaphysics of renunciation; it lies at the heart of the ascetic ideal. The "general renunciation of all interpretation . . . expresses, broadly speaking, as much ascetic virtue as any denial of sensuality (it is at bottom only a particular mode of this denial)." (§24) How to undermine such seriousness from the start - that is Nietzsche's question - and his solution is to offset it with a science of joy, a language of gaiety. But not of frivolity. It may be too bad but it is inevitable that we find it difficult to remain serious when we look at [present-day man's] worthiest goals and hopes, and perhaps we do not even bother to look any more. Another ideal runs ahead of us, a strange, tempting, dangerous ideal ... the ideal of a spirit who plays naively . . . with all that was hitherto called holy, good, untouchable, divine ... the ideal of a human, superhuman well-being and benevolence that will often appear inhuman - for example, when it confronts all earthly seriousness so far, all solemnity in gesture, work, tone, eye, morality, and task so far, as if it were their most incarnate and involuntary parody - and in spite of all this, it is perhaps only with 48 This passage originally appears in The Gay Science, trans.

(Gay Science,^ 382.) To Freud and his followers at the Vienna Society meetings, Nietzsche's formulations, brilliant as they may have been, required translation back into a scientific framework in order to be acceptable. By themselves, his works represented raw data, a magnificent case study. "In Nietzsche's work," Adler noted, "one finds on almost every page observations reminiscent of those we make in therapy, when the patient has come rather a long way and is capable of analyzing the undercurrents in his mind." (Minutes, I, 358.) It was not easy to determine just what had gone awry with poor Nietzsche, but it could be glimpsed in his language, in its extremes, its posturing, its gaiety, its dissimulations and contradictions, its interpretative freedom. These were matters of concern at the meetings in 1908, and Nietzsche was put on the couch. Hints of madness were detected in every excess associated with his writings. Hitschmann, for example, prefaced his discussion of the Genealogy of Morals with this thought: "[Nietzsche] wrote this voluminous pamphlet in twenty days, that is, with pathologically accelerated speed." (Minutes, I, 356.) The mood of the meetings was perhaps best captured in a wistful remark of Federn's: "One could wish that many poets, founders of religions, and other men of stature had submitted to therapy; then they might have accomplished great things." (Minutes, II, 29.) No one notices that Nietzsche is writing with them in mind, writing against them, against their smug, pretentious, self-satisfied, "scientific" judgments. He multiplies interpretations endlessly; they shake their heads and redeem this rude proliferation in a uniform language of clinical diagnosis. They see in him a disillusioned ascetic; he sees in them unmitigated asceticism. They are astonished at his immodesty; he is astonished at theirs. "But I should think that today," Nietzsche writes, "we are at least far from the ridiculous immodesty that would be involved in decreeing from our corner that perspectives are permitted only from this corner. Rather has the world become 'infinite' for us all over again, inasmuch as we cannot reject the possibility that it may include infinite interpretations" (Gay Science, § 374.) Nietzsche's language is not understood. His strategies are all misread as errors, delusions, illness. Freud, however, is more reserved in his speculations and judgments at these meetings than most of the other participants. He</page><page sequence="27">Freud, Nietzsche 29 does not understand Nietzsche's personality, but he sees no indication that Nietzsche was neurotic, or worse, not even in Ecce Homo, Nietzsche's last book. Un-Germanic perhaps, but there is something there. Nietzsche can put words to Freud's mute ideas. Nietzsche has ideas worth repeating. Secret disciple, errant master. Freud and Nietzsche address themselves at times to the same subjects, at times in the same words, but always in two different languages. In Civilization and Its Discontents Freud transcribes Nietzsche back into the language from which he was making his escape, and thinks he has said something new. Perhaps he has, since no one points a finger. Perhaps a triumph is recorded in the struggle taking place here to dominate discourse. Scientific over poetic. Who fails today to yield to the language of science, to the solemnity of its intonations, to the authority of its quest for truth? Nietzsche understood this. He understood the prejudices of science, and he understood the power of language to possess, to manipulate and to create. He understood the battle he waged. "We can destroy only as creators. - But let us not forget this either: it is enough to create new names and estimations and probabilities in order to create in the long run new 'things.'" (Gay Science, § 58.)</page></plain_text>
