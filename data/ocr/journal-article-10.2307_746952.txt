ROBINSON, Emeritus, University of Chicago HELEN K. SMITH, University of Miami SUMMARIZES 416 reports of research dealing with reading pub- lished between July 1, 1968 and June 30, 1969. The studies are grouped into six major categories. The first category includes 72 summaries on specific topics, almost twice the number appearing in the previous summary. The second category incorporates studies in teacher preparation and practice. The third category, sociology of reading, deals with such areas as investigations of the effects of reading, information retrieval, and persuasion resulting from reading. Category four, the physiology of reading, covers such areas as intellectual abilities, language abilities, and reading interests. Several new sub-sections on oral reading, later- ality, visual perception, and auditory perception have been added this year. The teaching of reading, the fifth category, surveys studies of reading materials, instructional techniques, and test development and validation. The last category contains studies on the reading of the mentally retarded and the blind. An anno- tated bibliography of 416 titles is included.

An upward trend in the number of investigations categorized under the psychology of reading is especially noticeable this year. Of special interest to reading researchers as well as to all members of the profession are Kucera's and Francis' (226) word lists and other data based on a computer analysis of a more than one million-word corpus. Their book includes a descending word frequency list, an alphabetical list, and a number of tables and graphs resulting from various counts, calculations, and studies. Another report of general interest is that by Summers (381) based on an analysis of previous annual summaries of research in reading. Core journals contributing to the research literature over a period of years were identified. The process of classifying the research under six major categories has been continued. Four of the six major categories have been further subdivided and each study has been classified within a specific sub-category. Although some studies may logically fit within several sub-categories or even under more than one major category, a decision had to be made to place it under the sub-category in which it seemed to fit best. Each study cited in the discussion section is followed by a number in parentheses which refers to the alphabetical annotated bibliography, found after the text. I. Summaries of specific aspects of reading research To help the reader locate summaries in the section that follows, they have been classified by topic whenever more than one report deals with a single topic.

Teacher preparation and practice Two studies focused on different aspects of teacher prepara- tion. Bush and Putnam (62) surveyed the practices that their col- lege juniors experienced in the public schools. They found that typi- cally the classes were self-contained, used a basal reader, and had three reading groups. About 10 per cent experienced individualized reading or the multi-level approach. Other innovations were few. Phonics workbooks were used in 70 per cent of classes and were integrated with the basal reader program. Fewer than half of the students had access to any kind of test data for the pupils. About half of the classrooms had remedial services available with pupils leaving the classroom, and 23 per cent had access to reading clinics.</page><page sequence="8">138 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 Ilika (192) compared performance of teachers during the years 1962-67 on the Aaron Vowel Phonics Test with the data col- lected by Aaron in 1957-59. He also examined regional differences and related teacher knowledge to the utility of vowel principles as reported by Clymer. The earlier study was done largely in Georgia while this one included samples from Oregon, Texas, and Missouri. The teachers or prospective teachers included both elementary and secondary levels. The investigator found significantly higher mean scores and lower variances in the 60's group leading him to conclude that teacher knowledge of vowel phonics had improved. Comparing the means of regional groups revealed significant differences favoring the Texas sample. Analyses of the eight vowel principles included in the Aaron test in relation to Clymer's criteria for utility revealed that, in general, the teachers knew the least useful vowel principles better than the most useful. State certification of reading teachers and specialists was analyzed by Kinder (212) through 52 completed questionnaires. He reported that 23 states required certification while two have endorse- ment which is not required. The 38 different certification credentials differed markedly from the minimum standards published by IRA in 1965, with only eight meeting the standards. Among the 29 state agencies not requiring certification, six were reported as developing programs, five planning for such programs, and four others consid- ering them. Ten additional states indicated that they may have certification by 1970. Other general or special certificates permitted persons to teach special reading classes. Of interest was the report that the 13 states not planning reading certification in the foreseeable future enrolled, in 1967, about one third of U. S. school children and included approximately 30 per cent of the total illiterate adult population of the U. S. A. Olson (293) examined data concerning content teachers' practices relating to reading. Five of the 20 items were chosen for pertinency and all were significant at the .01 level. The results re- vealed that the teachers (except for those teaching a foreign lan- guage) felt that the reading difficulty of texts was almost always suited to the reading levels of the students. However, in general, little or no provision was made to provide other reading matter for those students who could not read the texts. Half or more than half of all teachers reported that most of the time they knew the special reading skills required by their subject. A large majority grouped students in the classroom for differentiated instruction. The teachers knew</page><page sequence="9">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 139 the reading levels of their texts most of the time, but they secured the information from publishers' reports of the grade level for which the text was appropriate. Morrison, Harris, and Auerbach (283), attempting to deter- mine the after-effects of a reading research project on staff and cur- riculum, interviewed teachers and principals who had participated in the CRAFT Project and administered the San Diego Attitude Inventory. The investigators found that 43 of the 57 teachers were not using the same method in the same way as they did during the research project, 7 said that they were, and 7 said that they were no longer teaching reading. Those teachers who used a language experi- ence approach tended to revert to the basal reader. Those who used the basal reader in the experiment continued to use it but not as the sole tool of instruction. Results of the inventory revealed that the teachers were favorably disposed toward basal reader instruction. The methods used in the experiment were criticized by participating teachers. Some felt that the methods were too structured while others disliked the lack of structure. Heterogeneous classes were disliked, and all but one administrator returned to homogeneous grouping. An overwhelming majority of the teachers believed that participation in the study had a salutary effect on their professional abilities even though some aspects were undesirable. The majority of the principals reported more enthusiasm and expertise among experimental teach- ers, as well as higher pupil achievement. Generally, other teachers in the same school were not influenced by the experiment. Reaction to the experiment among parents was very slight. Two reports dealt with in-service education of teachers. Smith and Otto (364) gave a reading improvement course to secondary- school teachers who volunteered to participate. The authors' purpose was to determine the effects of improving reading proficiency on the teachers' attitude toward teaching their students. The teachers were given ten hours of instruction in rate, interpretation, literal compre- hension, and vocabulary. The Nelson-Denny Reading Test and an attitude inventory were administered as pre- and post-tests. The latter included 14 items, half positive and half negative, and was found to have a pre-test reliability of .85. The median percentile ranks of the 19 teachers on the reading test improved as follows: vocabulary, 58 to 76; comprehension, 76 to 85; and rate, 70 to 91. However, the gains were not accompanied by major changes in attitude toward teaching their students to read better. Indeed, three items relating to their role in teaching reading revealed a marked negative shift. The</page><page sequence="10">140 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 teachers' responses to a questionnaire mailed a week after the course ended revealed that 11 were more willing to include reading in their instructional programs and 7 were already using some of the tech- niques. The second report by De Carlo and Cleland (95) studied the effects of in-service training on instructional procedures and atti- tudes of 6 experimental teachers and 6 control teachers. A week-long pre-school program for the experimental group was devoted to better understanding of reading skills' development; during the same week, the control group studied children's literature. Bi-weekly seminars provided in-depth study of specific areas for the experimental teachers. Consultant services, with a visit every three weeks, was provided for both groups. Critical ratios of unnamed pre-tests of intelligence, read- ing, and socio-economic levels revealed equivalence of pupils or mean scores favoring the control group. Final tests of the teachers included the San Diego Attitude Inventory on which no difference in attitude was found. Evaluation of the seminars and visits of the consultant resulted in reported changes in number of skills taught and number of activities used. The consultant's evaluation confirmed the teachers' reports with the difference favoring the experimental group. However, scores on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, given at the end of a semester, revealed no significant differences among the children's reading. The experimental group scored statistically higher than the control on the McCullough Word Analysis Tests but no differences were found in their attitudes toward reading. The role(s) of the reading consultant, as perceived by teach- ers and consultants in four New England states, were compared by Wylie (413). One hundred elementary teachers and 100 reading consultants were chosen randomly to receive a questionnaire. The major differences found in the activities deemed most important by each group were noted. Both groups agreed that supplying materials and providing in-service education were important. However, teachers preferred in-service work which was more personalized or in smaller groups. Teachers wanted demonstrations while consultants empha- sized organization and program. The characteristic of consultants most important to teachers was knowledge of reading and related areas; consultants considered the ability to establish rapport most important. Both groups agreed that the consultant should have ele- mentary classroom experience. Rothrock (335) conducted a questionnaire survey of teachers' reactions to and experiences with an individualized reading plan.</page><page sequence="11">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 141 The questionnaire was divided into five sections: 1] a survey of how widely the plan was being used; 2] a section questioning those who were using it; 3] a section questioning those who had tried it but had abandoned it; 4] a section for those who had never used it; and 5] a section of questions on the influence and trends of individualized reading. When asked if they were familiar with the individualized reading approach, 40 per cent said yes, 48 per cent said somewhat, and 11 per cent said they were not. Of those who had used it, 86 per cent were still using it regularly. Among the advantages teachers noted for individualized reading were: 1] children could proceed at their own pace; 2] greater interest in reading occurred; and 3] indi- vidual differences could be met. When asked to identify from a list the factors that limited use of individualized reading, large class size, lack of materials, lack of training, and lack of sufficient time were most often checked. Lack of knowledge concerning the ap- proach was the most frequently cited reason for not using it. Of those responding, 68 felt that individualized reading had had a real influ- ence upon the teaching of reading. III. Sociology of reading Members of diciplines other than reading have again been responsible for the research completed in the sociology of reading. More studies were concerned with the use of the mass media, con- tent analysis of printed sources, and persuasion resulting from read- ing than with any of the other aspects of the sociology of reading. In addition, the number of books being published in the field continues to grow year by year. III-1 Use of different mass media Bogart (45) used data from a national survey, conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation, to determine the news interests and the preferred news medium of the American public. In the survey, each of 120 news and information messages was reduced to a one- sentence summary; an equal number of advertisements and com- mercials were also abridged. In each interview subjects were asked to rate their interest from "a great deal" to "none at all" for each of 12 randomly selected items of general information and 12 advertising messages. The items originally from radio news received the highest interest scores followed by, in order, television, newspapers, and</page><page sequence="12">142 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY ? Winter 1970 V/2 magazines. A very high degree of agreement was found in the interest scores on the individual items between men and women but less so between adults and teenagers. Adults showed the highest interest in stories about health followed by items dealing with space, accidents and disasters, and articles about world and national politics. Some news items were of great interest to a large proportion of the public but had little or no interest for a substantial minority. Almost no category was found that did not have high appeal for at least some people. To see how well the public's interest in the news was reflected in the judgments made by newspaper editors, 52 managing editors completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to guess the public's rating of interest in the messages. The rank order coefficient of correlation between the editors' rankings and the public's ratings was .33. In general, the public preferred television for stories of war, politics, and disaster, while newspapers were preferred for human interest stories, the background items, and details on events of local or specialized interest. The study by Greenberg and Kumata (147) was a part of a larger investigation in which data were collected from Finland, Japan, Costa Rica, Mexico, and the United States. The present report dealt only with data gathered in the United States by the Gallup or- ganization. The sampling procedure was designed to approximate the adult civilian population living in private homes. The principal con- cerns of the investigators were the national levels of exposure to the broadcast and the print media, the degree of relationship of exposure among media, the demographic characteristics which best predicted media exposure patterns, and the extent to which reading, viewing, and listening habits could be accounted for by the demographic variables used in the present study. The respondents in this study reported spending on the average a quarter hour more per day view- ing television than listening to the radio. A lack of symmetry in the patterns of exposure among the four media was found. For the most part, exposure to any one medium was independent of exposure to a second, except for the print media. Only the number of newspapers and magazines read yielded a substantial coefficient of correlation, .37. Of the eight predictors, only sex showed even a moderate rela- tionship with hours of TV viewing, with women watching significantly (.001) more than men. The following curvilinear relationships were observed: TV viewing peaked at the high school level, and TV view- ing was greatest in the $4,000 to $5,000 income bracket with con- sistent drop-offs in higher and lower income groups. For radio, age</page><page sequence="13">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 143 and sex were significant discriminants with women listening more than men and with the peak of listening occurring among those in their thirties. The coefficient of correlation between education and newspaper usage, .492, was the largest found among the variables and media exposure. In addition, income variables, especially total income, were related to newspaper readership. The variables which characterized newspaper users also described the magazine users, but the relationships were not so great. To determine whether the combined relationships were larger than the single variable relation- ships, the eight independent variables were correlated simultaneously with each of the media behaviors. For all four media usage measures, the multiple correlation analysis increased predictability, but for television and radio no variable examined was very sensitive. Mass media effects on the political socialization of children and pre-adults were investigated by Byrne (63). The subjects came from four subcultures: the rural Negro, the urban Negro, the rural white, and the urban white. It was found that Negro children were exposed to news on television as often as white children; the same finding applied to rural and urban children. No significant difference was found between political information levels, as determined by current events questions and white or Negro subjects. However, Negro children had significantly (.01) less exposure to newspapers than white children did. Families of urban children subscribed to news- papers significantly more often than families of rural children. Negro children who were more exposed to electronic than print media, demonstrated more positive attitudes toward the government than did white children who were relatively more exposed to print media; the Negro children also perceived the government as being more effective than white children. In addition, the rural children had more positive perceptions of governmental effectiveness than urban children. Subjects from a predominantly Negro ghetto area in Pitts- burgh, Pennsylvania, were interviewed by Allen (8) to determine their use patterns for different types of mass media: radio, television, newspaper (daily, weekly, Sunday), and magazines. Although the respondents purchased a Sunday paper about four to one over a daily or weekly paper, there was no significant increase in reading time of the Sunday readers over daily or weekly readers. The average radio listening time was five and one half hours a day on weekdays, mostly in the morning. No definite pattern of program or news selection for radio listening emerged. The average subject used the newspaper</page><page sequence="14">144 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 scarcely or not at all for important news events. Most of the television viewing occurred in the afternoon and evening, with heavy television watching being reported for the hours between 5 p.m. and 12 mid- night. All television owners reported watching broadcasts of local news; 72 per cent also reported viewing a national network newscast. In spite of this fact, most were uninformed about current events and geographical locations. Ebony was the magazine read by most of the interviewees. Although two thirds of the respondents received maga- zines, none took a weekly news magazine. The survey revealed that the subjects in this study depended almost entirely for their news on the evening television newscast, and that this source was not supplemented with additional information from other media. Several generalizations about the effects of mass media on Negro ghetto residents were drawn. The relationships between the usage of newspapers, maga- zines, radio, and TV and the degree of political activity of U. S. citizens were analyzed by Becker and Preston (29). Data used had been gathered from a national cross section sample during a study of the 1964 Presidential election. Eight political variables covering indices of psychological involvement, voting, and active involvement other than voting were assessed. An index of political efficacy based upon the respondent's reaction to four statements was used to deter- mine psychological involvement. Education was found to have the highest relationship with the time of voting choice, index of political efficacy, voting in previous elections, and the tendency to write letters. Media usage had the greatest association with the respondents' con- cern for the election outcome, interest in the campaign, voting in 1964, and attempts at personal persuasion. The index of political efficacy was highest when levels of education especially and of media usage and income were highest. The higher the mass media usage, education, and income, the greater was the voter percentage. The influence of media exposure upon the political knowledge of adults in Quito, Ecuador, was explored by McLeod, Rush, and Friederich (269). A variety of indices of political knowledge were used. Along with other information, respondents were asked to name five political leaders holding specific positions, to identify five national programs of interest, to comment on a current news story of great importance to the economic future of the region, and to state the most important problem facing Ecuador and suggest means of allevi- ating it. Other measures included the time spent with movies, radio, and television; the number of magazines read; the frequency of</page><page sequence="15">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 145 movie attendance; the reading of books plus recall of their titles; the frequency with which the respondents read various types of "hard" and "soft" news in the paper; the ownership of media; a three-step scale of confianza for credibility; an inventory of ideal communica- tion practices; and the usual socio-economic measures of age, educa- tion, occupation, and length of residency. The results of the study re- vealed that national and international political knowledge were highly correlated and that each was strongly associated with the knowledge of the newly-released news story. The measures of the awareness of a problem and the offering of a solution to the problem did not show strong relationships with each other or with the first three indices. Radio was used by 90 per cent of the sample; newspapers, by almost as many. More than half had attended movies during the previous month, approximately one half read magazines, approximately one third read books, and the same proportion watched television. The levels of actual possession of media in the homes were lower. Because no generalized pattern of media exposure was found, each of the media exposure items was examined separately to determine its association with political knowledge. The coefficient of correlation of Total Exposure and Total Knowledge was .243. Magazine and televi- sion exposure showed somewhat stronger associations with knowledge than did newspaper use. Little relationship was found between the exposure measures and awareness of a problem and offering a solu- tion. The possession of media in the home, as contrasted with media exposure, was related strongly to knowledge (.58); it was also related to the awareness of a problem and the statement of its solution. Magazine use appeared to be the best single exposure predictor of knowledge. The level of credibility was low, with about one half of the subjects having little or no confidence in each of the four media. When the responses regarding ideal family communication patterns were analyzed, it was found that the "protective" parents (the 45 per cent indicating a traditional pattern) showed the lowest level of political knowledge and that the pluralists (28 per cent) were the most knowledgeable and had higher levels of media use and posses- sion. The investigators concluded that the results of their urban case study provided no clear confirmation that media exposure led to greater political knowledge. In their study of the use of five different mass media (news- papers, magazines, radio, television, and cinema) by the middle and upper classes in France and Egypt, Lorimor and Dunn (244) con- cluded that both classes appeared to make more use of newspapers</page><page sequence="16">146 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 1V/2 than any other mass medium. They found, however, a surprisingly large number of French respondents who did not see or hear any mass medium during the day preceding the study. Socio-economic status as determined by income, education, or occupation did not appear to be a very good predictor of media use by either class in either country. The Egyptians showed more interest in media adver- tising than the French did. The cinema was the least used medium in both countries. Media use outside the home was low in both coun- tries. In general, men spent more time in media use than women did in both France and Egypt. The study by Meyersohn (273) was designed to determine the influence of six leisure resources upon the television-viewing of people in different income levels. Data from a national sample survey conducted in 1961 by Roper and the National Opinion Re- search Center were used. The major findings of the study included the following: no matter what measure was used (number of leisure activities named, pieces of leisure equipment owned, organization membership, newspapers read, books read during the past year, and movie attendance) the poor were less likely to participate. No differ- ence in television viewing rate resulted from a high as compared to a low rate of participation for indoor leisure activities, organizational membership, book reading, and movie going. However, those who had no other leisure equipment and those who were not newspaper readers were less likely to be heavy television viewers. The investigator con- sidered the over-all lack of relationship showed that most kinds of leisure orientations were quite independent of television viewing. The hypothesis that the poor watch television because they have no other resources was not supported by the data. The purpose of the study by Chang and Lemert (72) was to explore the reasons people give for assigning greater credibility to news reported on television over that reported in newspapers. In telephone interviews the subjects responded to media use and believ- ability questions, gave reasons for their choices, identified any of the seven newsmen whom they recognized, four of whom used the tele- vision medium and three of whom reported news in newspapers and magazines. Respondents answered additional questions about each newsman whom they correctly identified. The results of this study revealed a much higher proportion of people who said they used radio for news and a much wider believability lead for television over newspapers than in a previous Roper study. The reasons ad- vanced for the believability choice were collated. More than half of</page><page sequence="17">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 147 the respondents gave habitual kinds of reasons (convenience, "fit" into the life pattern, availability, and low effort) for their use of the media for news. Reasons were also reported for believability choice. "Better personnel" was given by 11 per cent of those believing tele- vision news and by none of those electing newspapers. However, the four television newsmen were known by a higher per cent of the sample than the three newspapermen. Significantly more men than women knew one or more of the newspapermen; significantly more of the better educated (both men and women) than of the less edu- cated knew one or more newspapermen. Among the conclusions of this study were the following: the advantages of television news (its immediacy and recency) were both obvious and important to the mass media audience; "better personnel" as an advantage of television news was the result of the subjects' lack of acquaintance with news- paper personnel, and not the result of TV's greater perceived quality; and those who found magazines to be the most believable news medium appeared to be similar to newspaper believers. Another study concerned with the believability of mass media was pursued by Jacobson (196), who analyzed data obtained in a sample survey of Wisconsin adults conducted in 1966 by the Wiscon- sin Survey Research Laboratory. Evaluation instruments used were a single-question ordinal measurement of believability and a multi- dimensional index of credibility and non-credibility judgments of media as news sources. A multi-dimensional measure of twenty adjectival opposites, adapted from those used in other studies, was used as a measurement of connotative meaning to determine basic receiver gratifications gained by radio, television, and newspapers. Data were first analyzed for comparative believability of the three media. Next, respondents were divided into four groups on the basis of their rankings of the media on the believability item (Television Believers, Newspaper Believers, Radio Believers, and Non-Believers, or the respondents who answered with "Don't Know" or "Depends.") Groups were then compared as to the judgment of source ratings. The results of this investigation were in harmony with those of other similar studies. The subjects of this study regarded television as the most believable, followed by newspapers and radio. They felt that television and radio were both significantly more accurate than news- papers. Respondents also found television news to be more complete than that in newspapers. Respondents who chose the newspapers as the most believable medium nonetheless rated newspapers as being significantly less objective than television and radio. Television Believ-</page><page sequence="18">148 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 ers and Radio Believers also regarded the newspaper as being significantly less objective than the medium they found most believ- able; both of these groups found no difference in the objectivity of television and radio. The diffusion of unexpected news under conditions of high constraint on inter-personal basis was explored by Allen and Colfax (7) when President Johnson announced that he would not run again for the presidency in 1968. The unexpected announcement, included in an announced major policy address, came via the medium through which most people obtain their news at a time of maximum exposure to television. The President's address was simultaneously broad- cast by radio; the news was reiterated with video-tape excerpts an hour later on the 11 o'clock news. The news was also repeated early the next day on newscasts and in the newspapers. Since the news was received late on a Sunday evening, the chance that people would pass the news along to others by word-of-mouth except to members of the household was minimized. Data were collected in a small Connecticut city by means of interviews with adult respondents within 48 hours of the announcement. Eighty-seven per cent of the weighted sample had heard the news when interviewed; the 13 per cent who had not heard the news were told its content by the inter- viewer. Of those who were knowers, 73 per cent had heard the original broadcast on television; 5 per cent, on radio; 3 per cent, on a later broadcast on television; 10 per cent, on a later radio broad- cast. Five per cent had read it first in a newspaper; another 5 per cent first received the news by word-of-mouth. Although there was little inter-personal relaying of initial information, there was consid- erable discussion of the event later with other people. From the findings of the study, the investigators concluded that the factors of constraint on word-of-mouth diffusion of important and unexpected news can under certain circumstances be depressed to a minimum, and instant saturation by electronic media can make interpersonal relaying of the news relatively unimportant in the diffusion of initial information. They also concluded that when important bulletin news broke under foregoing conditions, the two-step flow of initial informa- tion is relatively unimportant. From their study of mass media usage in the slum areas of Ecuador and India, Simmons, Kent, and Mishra (357) concluded that, despite other deprivations, the slumdwellers interviewed were not to be counted outside mass media audiences, although education and financial conditions limited their participation. A sample was</page><page sequence="19">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 149 taken of the content of a week of consecutive issues of two newspapers of Guayaquil, Ecuador, and five of New Delhi, India. In analyzing the newspapers, the following seven content categories were used: institutional and social change, social welfare, pace of development, physical projects, foreign aid, foreign trade, and monetary and fiscal policies. The Indian newspapers led the Guayaquil papers in the per cent of developmental news-editorial items in relation to total news-editorial content. The Guayaquil papers gave relatively more attention to education, business, and other financial matters, while the Indian press emphasized social problems more than the Guaya- quil papers did except for the discussions of housing and slum- clearance. The Indian newspapers gave considerable coverage to family planning, famine relief and rationing, and nation-to-nation foreign aid; the Guayaquil newspapers gave extensive treatment to commercial developments, trade agreements, taxes, transportation, and communication. Questionnaires were completed by 399 respond- ents in Guayaquil and 406 in New Delhi. It was found that there was a more extensive use of newspapers and radio, a greater availability of newspapers and radio receivers, and a higher level of literacy in the Guayaquil sample than in the New Delhi one. Television was not found extensively in the major cities of either country. Neither in Ecuador nor in India was much evidence found of group reading and discussion of newspaper content as had been found in previous studies. The respondents in Guayaquil rated newspapers and radio equal in believability (65 per cent for each); in New Delhi, 72 per cent felt that radio was the most trustworthy medium with 11 per cent naming newspapers as the most believable. A relationship was found between education and newspaper reading but not between education and radio listening. III-2 Literacy Descriptive information concerning adult illiterates who at- tended the Adult Basic Education classes of the Buffalo City Schools was presented by Brown (56). The illiterate Negro adult subjects were almost all of rural background with 75 per cent having been reared on a farm. The reasons for not attending school given most often were, in order: a need for the subjects to remain at home, lack of available schools, and parental or personal disinterest. Forty-two per cent had no one who could read in their present family situation, although some stated they had access to a "reader" whose services they could borrow. When asked to give the reason that they wanted</page><page sequence="20">150 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 to learn to read, their answers were largely utilitarian: to take care of their own personal needs, to get a job, to get a better education, and to read the Bible. As a group, these adults had few traveling experiences even within the city. When presented with fictitious titles of books which had been composed to represent areas of pos- sible reader interest, at least 90 per cent selected the titles related to vocational improvement, personal appearance, religion, peace, health, and history. On the WAIS, the subjects performed poorly on Digit Symbol, Digit Span, Similarities, Information, and Block Design; they did better on Comprehension than on any other sub-test. The group averages on the sub-tests of the Leiter Adult Intelligence Scale were not high enough to reach the lower end of the norms. All of the sub- jects exhibited a lack of common knowledge on which to base instruc- tion. Brown felt that these adults would be difficult to teach, because they had learned little from their environment and tended to be non-perspective. They tended to be very dependent on others, to be interested in concrete, utilitarian kinds of topics for study, and not to be greatly interested in pressing political or social topics of the day. 111-3 Content analysis of printed sources The treatment of emotions found in literature was examined by Lindauer (235) in order to evaluate the findings of psychology related to emotions. The researcher noted that a previous content analysis of 172 psychology textbooks written during the past 85 years revealed that unpleasant emotions received about twice as much attention as pleasant ones. The literary materials in the present study were checked against a list of 120 terms used in the previous investi- gation and divided into an equal number of pleasant and unpleasant emotions. The emotional terms were located, their frequency of use was determined, and the date of usage was tallied for each of five sources (novels, plays, poetry, quotations, short stories). Of the 120 different emotions listed, a total of 104 were found. Of these, no statis- tically significant difference in the number of pleasant and unpleas- ant emotions was found in general or in each source. The frequency with which each emotion was referred to in each of the five sources remained relatively consistent. Although the researcher found no significant difference between the two types of emotions found in literature, there was a substantial difference between the frequencies with which pleasant and unpleasant emotions were referred to. In each source, the difference in favor of pleasant emotions was signifi-</page><page sequence="21">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 151 cant; these results were in sharp contrast with those of psychology. Twenty-three emotions (of which 13 were pleasant) accounted for 79 per cent of all references; pleasant emotions accounted for 76 per cent of the foregoing group. A ranking of the most commonly mentioned emotions revealed that 10 of the top 12 were pleasant. In addition to the foregoing findings, at all time periods the number of references to pleasant emotions exceeded those of the unpleasant. From the findings of this study, Lindauer concluded that the con- trasting treatment of emotions in literature suggested that an empha- sis on the unpleasant may be peculiar to psychology. The kind of image beginning college students receive as a result of the treatment given the mass media in introductory political science courses was the principal concern of Pilegge (308). The con- tent of eight textbooks was analyzed by the tabulation of statements which could be classified as positive or negative. Two areas of in- quiry were determined: press freedom and press performance. The analysis of the eight textbooks revealed a favorable attitude toward both the freedom of the press and the performance of the media. However, when the textbooks were examined individually, a consist- ent positive relationship between advocacy of press freedom and support for the performance of the press was not found. The investi- gator concluded that the image of the American press conveyed to college freshmen by means of textbooks used in introductory Ameri- can government courses was generally a balanced one. The number of unfavorable comments was more than balanced by statements sup. portive of the mass media. Commitment to a free press characterized the text studied; their authors tended to perceive the press as a vital institution in a democratic political system. Levy (234) analyzed the content of editorials from America (a Jesuit weekly), Barron's (a weekly business magazine), and Ebony (a monthly Negro magazine) by means of multidimensional tech- niques of analysis. After a major concept of each editorial was sel- ected, the number of printed lines for each editorial was determined. Each reference to the selected concept was then enumerated in harmony with the following criteria: adjectives used to describe the concept, nouns used as predicate adjectives, adverbs associated with the active form of the verb, and verbs, both active and passive, associ- ated with the concept. The foregoing words were classified according to the 1,000 categories of Roget's Pocket Thesaurus. The 18 categories appearing most frequently formed the basis of the 18 semantic</page><page sequence="22">152 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 differential-type scales. The experimenter divided editorials into sev- eral sections, rated each section on all of the scales, and determined the score for a concept by summing the scores for the particular con- cept on a scale. The experimenter found that when the scales were selected to represent the source itself, very little overlap occurred. Pearson product-moment coefficients of correlation between pairs of scales within a source were obtained so that factor structures for each of the sources could be determined. The results of 27 factor analyses of random data showed that statistical significance was reached by one factor of the Ebony analysis, primarily a status factor; two factors of the Barron's analysis, an active-passive factor and legality and trust factor; and three factors of America, including a factor of awareness of action or intent and an active-passive factor which dealt with anti-religious-religious and truthful-erroneous scales. The author concluded that the verb scales did not all load on a single factor as they would have if they had represented an active-passive dimension and if the active-passive had been a unitary concept. Furthermore, factors which emerged were not always conceptually clear and did not fall into the previous pattern of semantic-differential research nor did they appear comparable among the sources. To gain an indication of newspaper editorial sentiment in the South and Southwest toward the Zimmermann telegram, Bridges (52) analyzed 13 daily newspapers published between March 1, 1917, the day the telegram was released to the press, and April 8, 1917, just after the U. S. decided to enter the war. The telegram contained the German proposal that Mexico and Japan join Germany in an alliance against the United States if America entered the European war. The investigator found that the importance of the telegram lay not in the discovery of a military scheme but in the unifying effect it had on the American people, especially in the South. The 13 editors revealed in their editorials the lack of and the need for American military preparedness and stated that the anti-war senators and paci- fists no longer had a leg to stand on. The 13 newspapers did not consider the Zimmermann telegram to be the major cause of Ameri- ca's entry into World War I, but did see it as a contributing factor in America's decision to fight. Repass and Chaffee (321) examined the administrative and campaign coverage in one Democratic and seven Republican Wis- consin daily newspapers during the presidential campaigns of 1956 and 1964. Weekday samples were taken from editions published from</page><page sequence="23">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 153 the first day of campaigning by either candidate to the day before election day. Content analysis was performed on the column-inch of text, each news item being characterized as coverage of one of the two candidates and as either administrative (coverage of incum- bent in his official duties) or campaign coverage. Bi-partisan coverage was excluded from the analysis. The results of the study revealed that when administrative and campaign coverage for incumbents were combined, Eisenhower received much greater total coverage in 1956 than Stevenson but not in the one paper favoring the latter. In 1964, Johnson had slightly greater coverage than Goldwater, even in the seven papers endorsing Goldwater. In 1956, 5 per cent of the coverage was classified as administrative, and in 1964, 8 per cent. The administrative coverage of Eisenhower was considerably lower in the one Democratic paper, but Johnson tended to be treated about the same by all papers. Eisenhower's campaign received 54.1 per cent of the campaign coverage in 1956; Goldwater's, 53.4 per cent in 1964. The experimenter expressed the opinion that the results of the study were not of so much interest as was the methodological point of distinguishing between campaign and administrative coverage. From selected daily and Sunday newspapers representing nine geographical areas in the United States, Wood, Pella, and O'Hearn (411) identified articles in which a reference was made to a scientific and/or technological development and/or in which a social, political, or economic issue concerning science or technology was included. The following information was tabulated for each article: the headline, day and date of publication, source and location of the article; the space taken by each article expressed in terms of column inches and characters; the theme of each article; the classi- fication of each article as science and/or technology; references or implications to one or more of the elements of the processes of science; the social implications, if any; and the knowledge of science prerequisite to the reading of each article. The study yielded the following generalizations concerning scientific or technical articles: Sunday newspapers contained more articles which occupied a greater average space per article than that found in daily newspapers. The largest proportion of the newspaper articles were classified as medicine (38 per cent), followed by articles dealing with the discipline of sci- ence (33 per cent) and space (22.5 per cent). The major emphasis in newspaper articles was on technology and technological application and/or implications of science. References were made to the process-</page><page sequence="24">154 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 es of science in 16.4 per cent of the 414 articles. Social implications of science or technology for citizens or elected officials were made in fewer than one fourth of the articles. Some science knowledge on the part of the reader was required for the understanding of 78.5 per cent of the articles analyzed in this study. Wax (394) examined all of the known issues of the Mary- land Gazette, published between 1745 and 1775, to determine the image of the Negro as portrayed in colonial American newspapers. He concluded that this particular newspaper presented a many-sided and complex image of the Negro to its readers. This image showed the Negro as being property but as also having human qualities. The investigator described selections from the newspaper which portrayed various aspects of the colonial Negro image. The principal purpose of the study by Lynch and Hartman (248) was to identify the dimensions of humor in advertising. A related purpose was to determine if these dimensions were similar to the dimensions of humor found in jokes. Subjects placed selected samplings of jokes and magazine advertisements along a forced normal continuum from most to least humorous. Over half of the jokes were selected from those salient on each of five factors isolated in prior research; the remainder of the jokes suggested humor preval- ent in advertising. The magazine advertisements were chosen to provide a diverse sampling of content humor elements such as puns, specialty humor, understatement, slapstick, and inconsistency. The ratings obtained from the Q-sort distributions were submitted to cor- relation and factor analysis. The following seven general dimensions of humor emerged from the analysis of joke stimuli: unusualness, potency, parent control, incongruity, competence, fantasy, and play on words. The factors of advertising humor were general knowledge, sophistication, sensitivity, simplicity, visualization, cuteness, staging, and abstraction. The dimensions of humor for jokes and advertise- ments were compared by means of the least square solution. The following five dimensions which represented the union of common features among factors for both jokes and advertising stimuli were identified: cultivation (the unusualness joke factor and the sophisti- cation and visualization advertising factors), nativity (the potency joke factor and the cuteness and simplicity advertising factors), role playing (parent control joke factor and the staging and abstraction advertising factors), capability (the competence joke factor and sensi- tivity and visualization advertising factors), and verbal expression (the play on words joke factor and sophistication advertising factor).</page><page sequence="25">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 155 111-4 Informational retrieval One study was concerned with the need for a greater under- standing of present methods of retrieval of information. The investi- gation by Littleton (239) of the bibliographic control and use of the literature of agricultural economics had two objectives: 1] to deter- mine the extent to which various types of publications by agricultural economists were indexed and abstracted in existing bibliographic services, and 2] to relate the use of various types of publications to their rates of indexing and abstracting. A statistical analysis was performed of the characteristics of agricultural economics literature as exemplified in 7,624 publications produced by U. S. agricultural economists between 1961 and 1963. Then the extent of inclusion of a stratified random sample of 1,527 publications in eight indexing and abstracting services was determined. Finally, the results of a questionnaire on the use of the literature by researchers and pro- fessional workers was analyzed. In the first phase of the study Little- ton found that the titles of agricultural economics literature appeared in a greater number of books, journals, and reports, and in a greater variety of forms than those in other fields, that the literature was published primarily in monographs and bulletins rather than in journals, that it contained a large component of popular information on the application of research, and that it was primarily devoted to agriculture instead of economics. Over 50 per cent of the reports were published by university departments. Fewer than one half of the publications were estimated to be indexed or abstracted in one or more of the services, however. Significant differences were found to exist in the rate of indexing among sources of publication because bibliographical services concentrated upon periodicals devoted to one particular subject and generally ignored large groups of publi- cations not in periodicals or in serial form. Four factors influ- enced indexing: the form of publication, the national authority of the publisher, the purpose of the publication in terms of research versus information, and chance factors, such as the judgment of the indexer, policies and time limits imposed by individual bibliographical serv- ices, and the obscurity of the publication or the publisher. The investi- gator found that extensive use was made of information sources by agricultural economists; they, however, felt that informal discussion with colleagues and direct use of professional publications in their field were of greater value in keeping abreast with current develop- ments than the current indexing and abstracting services.</page><page sequence="26">156 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 III-5 Readability of printed materials Ford (126) investigated the appearance of questionnaires to be used in mail surveys. The response rate, the number of item non- responses, and the nature of the responses for a printed, folder-type questionnaire and a mimeographed, stapled questionnaire were com- pared. One half of a random sample of 1,556 subjects received the printed, folder-type questionnaire; the remainder, the mimeographed form. The questions were the same on both forms, but some were presented in a different order. To determine that no order effect was present, answers to these questions by questionnaire type were tested by means of the chi square statistic. No significant differences were found. The investigator found no significant differences for the two forms in the number of returned responses, the number of item non- responses, and the distribution of the answers. Wilhoit (400) tested Zipf's law of vocabulary balance, an equation predicting statistical regularity between word frequency and word ranking in written English. He obtained computerized word frequency data from a 104,737 word sample of Associated Press wire news. The word frequencies were plotted in logarithmic coordinates and compared with the slope produced by a newspaper language sample compiled and used by Zipf to illustrate his model. The two slopes somewhat followed the Zipf-predicted standard slope of 45 degrees, but the computerized AP data corresponded to the predicted slope less well than Zipf's original sample. Wilhoit suggested the need for further word frequency analysis research using large samples and mathematical modifications of Zipf's equation. III-6 Readership Clyde (82) conducted a readership survey of one issue of the Minneapolis Star. Prior to the survey a panel of experts first judged and classified news items from the issue as pleasant-unpleas- ant, important-unimportant, and interesting-boring. Respondents in- dicated if they had read "some" (incomplete) or "all" (complete) of the item. The investigator determined which types of news attracted significantly higher readership by means of the t statistic. Items categorized as unpleasant and those classified as interesting attracted more readership than any other kind. However, there was no signifi- cant difference in the average readership of these two types, for items read completely or for those read only in part. No significant differ- ence in readership was found for important and unimportant items</page><page sequence="27">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 157 among readers who read all of an item. In the instances of incom- plete reading, readership of important news was more highly signi- ficant than readership of unimportant items. The purpose of the study by Carter (66) was to ascertain if the number of pages in an issue of a newspaper and effective readership of advertising were significantly related. The newspaper used in this study averaged 64 pages for the Sunday editions, 24 pages for weekday issues, and 8 for Saturday issues. Two advertisers (one, a pharmacy and the other, a federal savings and loan associa- tion) advertised in the smaller Saturday edition only; none of their competitors used the Saturday papers for advertising. Interviewees who were regular readers of the newspaper stated the approximate amount of time they spent reading the newspaper on different days. In addition, they were asked if they recalled seeing any pharmacy and federal savings and loan association advertisements. Based upon a quantitative measurement of each advertiser's readership in relation to the space used, an efficiency index was formulated: the total col- umn inches by each advertiser was divided by the total number of interviewees who recalled the advertising. The subjects in this study spent an average of 29.8 minutes reading the weekday issues; 14.1, the Saturday issues; and 63.8, the Sunday issues. It was found that as the number of pages in an issue increased, the average number of minutes spent reading each page decreased; that is, less time per page was spent in reading the Sunday paper than for either the Saturday or weekday editions. It was also found that the two com- panies that advertised only on Saturday had much better efficiency index scores than competing advertisers. Carter concluded that a newspaper advertiser received more attention for his advertisement if it appeared in an edition with fewer pages. Using the CONPAAD (Conjugately Programmed Analyses of Advertising) technique, Wolf, Newman, and Winters (409) ex- plored in three studies the relationship between time spent and rate of work performed to read an article with independent readership scores. CONPAAD, which evolved from work on operant behavior, required the subject to work in order to view or hear the stimulus material. Fourteen articles for which readership data were available were selected to represent a range from high to low reported readership and were interspersed with advertisements to create an abbreviated version of a popular women's magazine. Each page of the magazine was made into a slide for presentation via a rear-view projection system. Subjects were told that they could read an abbreviated maga-</page><page sequence="28">158 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 zine by pumping a foot pedal. Each slide was illuminated at maximum brightness for two seconds to permit the subject to decide whether or not to view further; after two seconds the light level began to decay rapidly. By pumping at the preset maximum rate, the subject could keep the stimulus on the screen at maximum brightness. Subjects were told that they could read whatever they wished. The rate of response and the amount of time spent on each slide were auto- matically recorded. The three studies used three different sets of subjects in two different locations. In the first study, college under- graduate women subjects were given an abbreviated magazine con- taining 14 articles. In the second study, six of these 14 articles were presented to 48 middle income housewives between the ages of 18 and 55. For the third study, six articles were shown to 96 middle-class married women under 25 years of age. Rank order correlations were obtained between time spent working to read and the independent readership scores. The hypothesis that time spent in working to read and the rate at which work will be performed to view the material are related to ad lib readership was sustained in the first two studies but not in the third. III-7 Reading interests, preferences, and habits Alderson (6) analyzed the responses of British teenagers to a questionnaire on newspaper and magazine readership and on radio and television viewing. A content analysis was first performed on three magazines, Valentine, Jackie, and Trend, as to stock situations of the plots, taboos, class rigidity, morality, reader identification, defi- nition of success, anti-intellectual attitudes, and social mores. A small per cent of boys were found to read the above magazines in- tended for girls; girls, however, read more novels than boys did, whereas boys tended to read for factual information more than girls did. Grammar school children remaining in school after age 17 read a greater number of serious and specialist magazines than those who intended to leave school at age 15 or 16. The reading habits of boys and girls were found to be vastly different in every group, and the interests of the boys were more varied than those of the girls. Weaver (391) investigated the news reading habits of in- service teachers who indicated on a questionnaire the newspapers and other news periodicals that they read regularly, the approximate time spent on such reading, and the importance they placed on vari- ous aspects and features of news periodicals, such as editorials, economic news, and news about national politics. The subjects were</page><page sequence="29">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 159 divided into a high, a middle, and a low group based upon scores on the Time Current Events Test, 1968. The investigator stated that when one considered the fact that the test was designed for high school students, the scores for both the low and the middle groups were not encouraging. Over one half of the subjects in the high and middle groups read one of the news magazines, and the median time spent daily in reading the news was thirty minutes for all three groups. The members of the high and middle groups placed more weight on national and international news than did the low group, but the percentages for all three groups were low. The middle and low groups stressed local news to a greater extent than the high group. Weaver concluded by questioning whether teachers spent enough time reading the news, whether they read aspects of the news which would sensitize them to the important issues, and whether they knew enough about the current scene to ensure that social studies programs were relevant for today's young people. Data about magazine subscription patterns of national mem- bers of the John Birch Society and Americans for Democratic Action were collected by Grupp (149) through mail questionnaires. Approxi- mately one fifth of each group did not subscribe to any magazine; another fifth subscribed to six or more. Among political journals, those in the Birch Society preferred American Opinion, National Re- view, Human Events, Freeman, and The Cross and Flag; members of the ADA subscribed to The New Republic, The Reporter, The Na- tion, Progressive, I. F. Stone's Weekly, The New Leader, and Dissent. In the two memberships no overlap in political magazine subscriptions and little communality in subscriptions even to the major weekly news magazines were found. Grupp concluded that active and in- volved respondents were likely to consider news and political news magazines their most important subscription and that exposure to these magazines further reinforced their already strong political convictions. From data provided by a National Opinion Research Center Amalgam Survey, McElroy (265) described 588 adult readers who reported that they read frequently. Seventy per cent read at least two of ten types of books frequently. Fiction had the most readers (46 per cent), and science, the fewest (13 per cent). Two thirds of the self-improvement readers read four or more types of books. In a given period of time mystery readers read the largest number of books, religion readers, the fewest. The readers of social science had the highest incomes and included the highest proportion of college</page><page sequence="30">160 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 graduates; conversely, the readers of religion included those with the lowest incomes and the lowest levels of education. The latter group tended to begin their reading late; whereas the readers of plays and poetry began reading early and read consistently. The highest coefficient of association was with health and self-improve- ment (0.71), the next highest, mysteries and fiction (0.67). The only negative coefficient was for social science and fiction (-0.28). Fiction readers were interested almost exclusively in fiction, includ- ing mysteries and plays, but the readers of non-fiction tended to read other forms of non-fiction. Readers of fiction, history, plays, poetry, or mystery tended to be consistent readers, that is, they had always read heavily. The readers in the foregoing groups read more books in a six-month period than the readers of any of the other subjects. The fewest number of consistent readers were the readers of health, hobbies and sports, and science. Many adults of both sexes read books on hobbies and sports, with the total readership of these being second only to fiction. Science readers read heavily with considerable variety and were highly educated. McElroy concluded that the readers of each of the ten categories with which she was concerned formed a group that could be described and differentiated in terms of reading habits and demographic characteristics. III-8 Juvenile book publication and reviewing Darling (90) presented a documented description of juvenile book publication and reviewing in America between 1865 and 1881, a period in which children's books increased in number and developed in form and content. New York, Boston, and Philadelphia were the principal centers for juvenile book publication; all companies in these cities published the works of at least a few well known authors. The two most characteristic trends in children's books of the period were the quarto (a book, square in shape, half picture and half text) and the series books. Although fiction and belles-lettres made up most of the publications, large numbers of informational books also ap- peared, especially in history, travel, biography, and science. Darling concluded that there had never before been such a large number of juvenile books dealing with such a variety of subjects and of such high quality as during the post-Civil War period. Literary critics, at- tempting to establish standards for children's literature, began pre- paring book reviews, and by 1865 book reviewing was a well devel- oped art. More than 2,500 children's books were reviewed between 1865 and 1881 in more than 4,000 separate reviews in 36 periodicals</page><page sequence="31">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 161 whose volumes were examined by Darling. Included in the study were reviews from all the important book reviewing journals and representative periodicals from many special groups. Periodicals covered a wide geographical area, and only in the South was there no periodical that reviewed children's books during this time. The Nation reviewed more children's books than any other magazine. A description of the characteristics of the reviews was given for each of the 36 periodicals examined as well as analyses of selected reviews. III-9 Effects of reading The moral and emotional effects of reading, as determined by high school students' responses to a questionnaire, were focused on by Sister Mary Corde Lorang (242). The replication of a study completed in 1944 by the same investigator made it possible for comparisons to be made between the two different populations. Among the questions asked, the following were considered to be the core questions: What books or magazines have had a good effect on you? Bad effect on you? The list of books and magazines men- tioned by the subjects was sent to a panel of judges to rate. Coeffi- cients of correlation between the good or bad effects and the ratings of the judges were determined. From 2.6 per cent of the books in one school to 31 per cent of the books in another school were judged as unfit for this population; rural young people mentioned significantly fewer unfit books than any other group. The number of books men- tioned per student had increased 1400 per cent since the 1944 study; the number of magazines mentioned increased 288 per cent in the same period of time. The investigator reported a positive coefficient of correlation between the kind of book and the kind of effect in every school. She concluded that a good book or magazine would most likely have a good effect and a bad book, a bad effect. When there was a low coefficient or correlation, she felt perhaps the discrepancy might be due to the social conditions of the students and/or adult viewpoint on the value of certain reading materials for young adults. Direct quotations of the students and the ratings of the judges for the books mentioned by the subjects were included in the book. The two-step flow of communication hypothesis was tested by Arndt (13) in a field experiment involving the diffusion of a new brand of a food product in a university-operated apartment complex. Each housewife was sent a cover letter and a coupon allowing her to purchase the product at one third of the retail price. At the end</page><page sequence="32">162 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 of the test period, personal interviews were conducted with 91 per cent of the wives. In all, 42 per cent used their coupons. A socio- metric method was used to determine opinion leadership; that is, each respondent was asked to supply three names of people with whom she discussed new food products when she wanted informa- tion. The investigator made a distinction between product-related comments received and comments given to others. The respondents were questioned about the contents of each comment received, when it occurred, whether it preceded or followed the purchase, and the name of the word-of-mouth transmitter. With 80 per cent of the comments being received from the other wives in the study, these comments could be cross-checked by comparing the questionnaires of both parties in the discussion dyads. Those designated as opinion leaders appeared to be influenced by the direct mail letter more than were the nonleaders. The data, therefore, supported the idea of a first-step flow of influence (the flow of messages from impersonal sources, or mass media, to the opinion leaders). In regard to the second step (the influence of the opinion leaders on the nonleaders, who are less affected by the impersonal sources) the leaders were the more active communicators, both as transmitters and receivers of word-of-mouth communications. An unexpected finding of the study was the relatively large amount of word-of-mouth information flowing from nonleaders to leaders. Harrell (161) compared the effectiveness of different com- binations of dissemination techniques in terms of 1] information assimilated by parents in preschool districts and 2] cost effectiveness of the techniques used in reaching the parents. The methods included the following: 1] booklet (containing specific suggestions to parents on various ways to help their preschool children) and form letter; 2] booklets, form letter, and personal letter; 3] booklets, form letter, personal letter, newspaper stories, radio broadcasts, and TV video- tape; and 4] demonstration to parents in which the booklets were used (with and without preschoolers or the parents involved). The interviewees in each of four districts were representative of a cross section of each total district population in regard to socio-economic status. The subjects were also classified according to the age of the oldest preschool child in the family and race (Negro and Caucasian). An opinionnaire was used to assess the awareness of the information disseminated by the four different methods. The analysis of variance technique was used with methods 1, 2, and 3 but not with method 4. The author concluded that the third method was the best means of</page><page sequence="33">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 163 disseminating information to the nonprofessional public in terms both of cost per parental unit and the amount of awareness of ways parents can be most helpful to their preschool children. Among the other conclusions are the following: the age of the preschool children did not significantly affect the awareness by parents of the values of early education; the Negroes in this study in general exhibited 20 per cent higher incorrect responses than did the Caucasians; the parents of lower socio-economic levels were less knowledgeable of the ways in which they might help their children prepare for school and for life than those of middle and upper socio-economic levels. In the study by Wyer and Schwartz (412) subjects were asked to evaluate one of four kinds of communications: statements about Negroes, statements about social issues, cartoons, or photo- graphs. The evaluations were investigated as a function of the quality of the communications that preceded them, whether the communica- tions in the series originated from one source or from different sources, the logical consistency of the communications in the series, and incen- tive to perform well on the rating task. The subjects were asked to rate a series of communications, half in each area being positive and the other half negative. Under one condition, all messages were attributed to one person; in another, each message was attributed to a different source. The results generally supported the hypothesis that source effects on communication evaluations were predictable from con- gruity theory only to the extent that the communication was contra- dictory to previous communications from the source that formed the basis for the evaluation of that source. When the degree of con- tradiction was low, the tendency to resolve incongruities may have been offset by a general tendency to evaluate communications in relation to a comparison level whose value increased with the quality of the communications previously read. This effect was opposite that predicted by congruity theory. When all messages were attributed to the same source, the influence of shift in comparison level ap- peared to increase with incentive to perform well; when the messages appeared to come from different sources, the opposite situation oc- curred. The three experiments by Carter, Pyszka, and Guerrero (67) revealed that avoidance did not increase with the aversiveness of the information but rather that motivation was separate from cognition. In the first study the proffered information was made as threatening as possible so that avoidance could be found in response to disson- ance. This information did not focus on negative aspects of the</page><page sequence="34">164 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 chosen alternative but rather on the negative aspects of the individual making the choice. Three conditions were induced, one lacking dis- sonance and two with dissonance. The subjects were asked to read one of two articles for an assignment, but they were first given sum- maries to read attacking persons taking a favorable stance on the topics, and then to choose between the articles. The subjects were questioned to ascertain whether identification with the content of the message had occurred and if the summaries were perceived as credible. Increasing the aversiveness of the information did not evoke more avoidance in the dissonance conditions; the opposite occurred. In the second study, half of the subjects (all women) were asked to indicate their interest in reading an article critical of their choice of automobiles, and the other half, their interest in reading an article critical of people making such a choice. Interest in reading these articles was assessed on a seven-point scale. The results showed that in cases in which the brand or attribute was highly relevant, attack- ing the individual himself was not more likely to produce avoidance behavior to the aversive information. In the third study, Carter gave each experimental subject both an attack on the choice and on him- self separately so that a more sensitive comparison of the difference in avoidance could be made. The subjects were junior high school students who participated in a study designed to arouse fear levels with regard to dental hygiene. Their interest in reading the reports was rated on a seven-point scale; results revealed that attack on the individual led to less avoidance. Gutman and Priest (151) investigated the conditions under which one person's aggression toward another would be judged as funny. It was postulated that a good person's hostile act would be seen as less hostile and more humorous and that a victim who de- served the hostility he received would elicit more humor than an undeserving victim. Both hypotheses were tested by manipulating the perceived goodness or badness of the two protagonists in four experimentally-written "squelch" jokes. Each subject read four differ- ent types of stories and responded to the stories by ranking them in order of humor, hostility, social acceptability of the aggressor, social acceptability of the victim, and justifiability of aggression. The final task of the subjects was to read four abstract paradigms for the experimental jokes and rank them in pleasantness. Both hypotheses were sustained and the findings confirmed the notion that social perception plays an important role in humor.</page><page sequence="35">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 165 III-10 Attitude and opinion change The primary purpose of the study by Jensen and Knecht (197) was to identify personality variables which would predict atti- tude change following three types of written messages (factual, emotional, and conforming appeals). The second purpose was to test the hypothesis that the personality measures which predict attitude change are dependent upon the type of written communication. Personality measures used in this study were manifest anxiety, authoritarianism, self-esteem, and intolerance of ambiguity. The experimenters also hypothesized that a given personality measure may have either a positive or negative relationship with attitude change, dependent upon the type of communication and that differ- ent personality measures would correlate with attitude change for each sex. Three different messages, seeking to show the undesirable effects of annual chest x-rays were constructed. Subjects were placed into one of two groups on the basis of sex and were randomly as- signed to one of the treatment groups. A multiple regression analysis was conducted for each sex in each treatment group, with the attitude change scores as the dependent variables and the personality scores as predictors. Significant F ratios for the cumulative regression were found for males receiving the conforming message and for females receiving the conforming and emotional appeals. No personality measure was related to attitude change following the factual appeal for either sex or for the emotional appeal for males. In the con- forming appeal treatment for the males, intolerance of ambiguity was positively correlated with attitude change; measures of anxiety and authoritarianism were negatively correlated. For the female subjects in the conforming appeal treatment, self concept was positively correlated and measure of anxiety negatively correlated with attitude change. In the emotional treatment, measures of anxiety were positively correlated with attitude change for the female sub- jects. The results were interpreted as supporting the hypotheses. Stone and Eswara (378) posed two questions in their study of opinion change: Does arguing against his best interest enhance the persuasiveness of the communicator, regardless of his prestige? Or does such enhancement come only for low prestige sources? Like- ability and credibility were isolated as factors in prestige. The sub- jects were randomly assigned to eight experimental conditions in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. The manipulated variables included the</page><page sequence="36">166 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 self-interest (occupation in this case), the expertness, and the like- ability of the source. The main dependent variable was attitude change on the issue of courtroom television. The source of the attitude change message was introduced as a respondent in a nationwide survey. He was further identified as either a television journalist or a lawyer specializing in criminal cases. Expertness was manipulated by describing the source as either a successful practitioner in his profession or an unsuccessful practitioner lacking in professional competence. Likeability was manipulated by noting that the people who knew the source considered him to be either pleasant, unpre- tentious, and sensitive to the needs of others or unpleasant, pre- tentious, and insensitive. No information was given about the trustworthiness of the communicator. All attitudes were assessed on bipolar seven-point scales before and after the attitude change message was read. The source was evaluated on his reliability as a source of information on the issue at hand, expertness on the issue, bias, trust- worthiness, likeability, and general attractiveness. The message was judged on how well made and sincere the arguments were. Likeability but no expertness interacted with self-interest in producing persua- sion. The unlikeable source enhanced his effectiveness by arguing against his best interests; such was not the case for the likeable source. An unlikeable source who argued against his professional self-interest was more persuasive in this study than a personally likeable source. The pre- and post-message factor analyses of source evaluation re- vealed that when explicit information concerning expertness and like- ability but not trustworthiness was available, people tended to draw cues from the other characteristics to estimate trustworthiness. Brinkman (54) studied the effectiveness of editorials and editorial cartoons in achieving opinion change, including both rever- sion (a restoration of opinion or attitude in which an individual reinforces the attitude held prior to the attack) and conversion (a restructuring of opinion or attitude in which an individual reinforces the attitude position advocated in the attack). Two cartoons on differ- ent subjects and four editorials on each of the two cartoon topics, containing alternative, same, supporting, or refutational arguments were investigated to determine if any would result in lasting effect or opinion closure. Opinion change and closure were the main de- pendent variables. Belief items tests were administered to the subjects before any communication was presented, after the first presentation of the material, at the conclusion of the study, and one week later. Among the principal findings of the experiment were the following:</page><page sequence="37">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 167 1] greater opinion change resulted when cartoons were presented with editorials than when editorials or cartoons were presented sep- arately; 2] when presented alone, an editorial resulted in greater opinion change than a cartoon did; 3] when the same arguments were used in editorials as in cartoons, closure was more effectively established than when alternative arguments were presented. The presence or absence of consistency in the use of modes of conflict reduction as a function of dogmatism was investigated by Crane and Sigal (88) in a pre-test, post-test design. Parallel forms of a questionnaire dealing with attitudes toward the Gemini Space Project and student participation in psychological experiments were administered to eighty subjects. The subjects also read a message, attributed to a group of students attending either a high or low prestige college which indicated disagreement with the subjects' probable responses. They completed Rokeach's Dogmatism Scale, a post-test questionnaire, a recall test of the reputational message, and an evaluation of the high and low status sources. The results of the investigation revealed that highly dogmatic individuals tended to resolve conflict by utilizing the available processes in an internally consistent manner, while nondogmatic subjects were considerably more inconsistent in response. Within the high status source condi- tion, the relationship of increasing discrepancy and greater compli- ance was significant but negligible in the low prestige condition. III-11 Persuasion resulting from reading Ray (318) obtained interest ratings on 128 selections which represented refutational and supportive defense messages on both sides of 16 controversial and 16 noncontroversial issues. Self-admin- istered questionnaires were completed by high school students, and 64 students were randomly assigned to controversial issue experi- mental conditions, 64 to noncontroversial experimental conditions, and 32 to control conditions. Each attitude questionnaire consisted of 32 pro and con statements on each issue and subjects indicated their agreement with each statement on a 15-point scale. In addition, a measure of interest was obtained. For the experimental subjects the same 16 issues were included in both the attitude measure and the interest rating questionnaire. Half of the control group received 64 controversial article titles and half 64 uncontroversial titles to rate for preference, so that any possible effect of the attitude pre-test could be observed. The results showed that no such pre-test effect occurred. In addition, respondents made interest ratings on four</page><page sequence="38">168 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY ? Winter 1970 V/2 articles: a refutational one on his side, and a refutational one on the opposite side; a supportive article on his side, and a supportive article on the opposing side. Ray found that the supportive defenses were preferred to the refutational and that the supportive defenses' advan- tage held for both issue types. For the noncontroversial issues the respondents indicated greater interest in defenses which opposed rather than defended their beliefs. Neither agreeing nor opposing defenses were favored for controversial issues. Rogers and Thistlethwaite (329) examined the interaction of active versus passive refutational defenses and immediate versus delayed attacks upon resistance to persuasion. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design with after-only measures on the dependent variables was used with the two between-subjects experimental manipulations: passive versus active and immediate versus delayed attacking messages. In- cluded in the experiment was a repeated-measures factor which con- sisted of a specific health truism on which defenses, attacks, and dependent measures were presented. Control conditions included an attack-only condition and a neither-defense-nor attack condition. In the first session under the experimental conditions, subjects were exposed to one of two types of defensive pre-treatments; in the sec- ond session they read messages which attacked their beliefs concern- ing each of two health truisms. The subjects also completed the Gordon Personal Inventory. One half of the subjects read a refuta- tional defense and underlined the key words; the other half read counterarguments critical of the truisms and wrote arguments to refute each objection. In the second experimental situation half of the subjects were exposed to attacking messages immediately after exposure to the defenses, while the other half was exposed to delayed attacks read two days after the first session. The results showed that following active defenses a delay in the attack increased resist- ance to persuasion, while following passive defenses a delay in the attack slightly decreased resistance to the attack. A similar inter- action effect was found on a dependent variable indicative of tenden- cies to discount the attacking message. There was no evidence that accumulation of belief-bolstering arguments produced an interaction effect upon opinions. The study by Nelson (287) was designed to determine whether amount, activity, and difficulty of the anchorings of beliefs to a person's values affected the subsequent resistance of the beliefs to persuasion. The experimental subjects participated in two sessions. The first session (defense) involved anchoring two different beliefs</page><page sequence="39">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 169 to the individual's values; the second session involved presenting at- tacks against these two beliefs and a third belief used as a control. Three variables were varied to give eight types of defenses: the first defensive variable was the number of values to which the belief was tied; the second was the extent to which the belief and value were perceived as having been linked prior to the defense; the last was the extent to which the person was called upon, during the defense, actively to link the beliefs and the goals. Two no-defense control conditions included an attack-only condition to determine the effect of the attacking messages in the second session when the belief had not been defended in the first and a condition involving neither de- fense nor attack in order to ascertain any change in belief caused by variables not under experimental control. Subjects took part in four conditions: an active defense, then attack; a passive defense, then attack; no defense, then attack; and neither defense nor attack. Sub- jects completed an opinion questionnaire concerning the issues in- volved. The subjects in the second session read messages which strongly argued against the normative positions on the beliefs, under- lined the most important clauses in each paragraph, and completed an opinion questionnaire asking for personal beliefs on the four issues regardless of any of the materials read in the test. The investi- gator found that active participation in the prior anchoring did confer a significant amount of resistance to persuasion, but no difference in resistance was found as a function of number of prior anchorings and the difficulty of their establishment. The purpose of the study by Preston (315) was to ascertain the nature of persuasive appeals found in advertising, to determine the relationships among emotional, intellectual, and rational appeals in advertising, and to test an alternate a priori classification of ap- peals, which categorized messages as producing associations with things which are either inherently or arbitrarily associated with the message topic. Forty-eight full-page ads from one issue of Life maga- zine were classified by the experimenter as arbitrary (associated with the product on the authority of the message) or sign-relevant (tang- ible, inherent characteristics of the product). The subjects responded to questionnaires which contained scales specifying the amount of emotional, intellectual, rational, and irrational appeal of the ads. No terms were defined for the subjects. The arbitrary ads were signifi- cantly lower than the sign-relevant ones on intellectual and rational appeal but significantly higher than sign-relevant ones on emotional and irrational appeal. In the arbitrary ads, emotional and irrational</page><page sequence="40">170 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 appeal were at similar levels, as were intellectual and rational appeal, with the first pair being significantly higher than the latter. For sign- relevant ads, rational appeal was higher than irrational but intellec- tual did not differ from emotional. While the nature of the product effected the relative emotionality of the message as perceived by subjects, it did not appear to have an equally strong effect on the relative rationality of the message. An experiment was conducted by Holt and Watts (182) to test predictions that increasing salience of the logical relationships among beliefs makes any specific belief in the system more resistant to persuasion, but facilitates change on logically related, unmentioned beliefs in the persuasive message relative to change in the belief at- tacked. Two manipulations in the form of a pre-test and a cognitive tuning, were designed to vary the degree of salience and the inter- relationships among beliefs. Two forms of the pre-test were distribu- ted randomly to 53 college students among subjects; in one, 24 propositions were presented as eight intact syllogisms, and subjects were to estimate the probability that a given proposition was true. In the other form, the propositions were distributed randomly through out the questionnaire. Two days later the subjects were presented, in a randomly determined manner, with persuasive messages directed at the minor premises of four of the eight syllogisms. One group was told they would be called upon to communicate verbally the ideas ex- pressed in the four messages. The second group was told that they would hear additional information later but to listen effectively, they must first comprehend the messages. All subjects again rated the probability of truth of the 24 statements and answered a multiple- choice test for comprehension. The two forms of pre-test and the two tuning conditions constituted a 2 x 2 factorial design. The form of pre-test affected the belief attacked in the manner predicted with subjects in the high-salience condition changing less; it had no effect on the logically related, but unmentioned beliefs. As a result of cognitive tuning, subjects in the high-integration condition changed more on the message contrary to prediction and on the unmentioned, but logically related, beliefs. Hypotheses concerning persuasive communications, based on reference group and congruity theory, were tested with middle- and upper-class, urban French and Egyptian subjects by Lorimor and Dunn (243). The persuasive messages used were five advertise- ments which had appeared in U. S. magazines but were not culture- bound. The headlines and the context were translated by bilingual</page><page sequence="41">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 171 nationals. Second versions of each headline and copy were written by professional copywriters from each country. The original photo- graphs were replicated by using French and Egyptian models. The completed persuasive messages included 20 advertisements about each product for each country. Ten subjects in each of 20 conditions were shown one message promoting each brand. Four measures of advertising effectiveness were used. The experimenters concluded that, based upon their findings, persuasive messages were easier to transfer from one culture to another than is generally thought. With the sub- jects in this investigation, it seemed to make little difference whether the source was native or foreign, whether the message was attributed or not, or whether it was illustrated. Some support was found for the hypothesis that a translated message was not so effective as one composed in the language of the intended audience. Lynn Anderson (11) stated that the purpose of her experi- ment was to test the relative efficacy of discrediting a source as a means of inducing resistance to persuasion. Two types of belief- defense messages were used: supportive messages which presented two arguments supporting the beliefs without arguments against the belief, and refutational messages which presented two arguments against the belief and then gave detailed refutations of the arguments. After reading the source-discrediting messages, the defense, and the attack messages, subjects completed a reading comprehension test containing one-sentence summary statements of each of the arguments used in the defense messages along with final opinion items. The subjects rated the various arguments and sources on semantic-differential scales. The principal conclusion of the study included: 1] discrediting the source of the message provided a highly effective means of inducing belief defense of cultural truisms when compared to a no defense control condition; 2] the source-discredit- ing treatment bolstered the defensive efficacy of the refutational de- fense; 3] the source-discrediting manipulation did not alter the com- prehension or amount of information conveyed through the attacking messages, but the attacking arguments were rated as less fair when attributed to the discredited sources than when the same arguments were attributed to the source that was not discredited. III-12 Reaction to the press The attitudes of Negro members of parent-teacher organiza- tions toward pictures of Negro personalities and events which might be included in junior high school social studies textbooks were in-</page><page sequence="42">172 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 vestigated by Poulos (311). Fifty-five illustrations from various publications were selected, classified into historical categories (slav- ery, emancipation, and twentieth century), made into picture slides, and projected on a screen for group viewing. The subjects viewed the slides and recorded their attitudes on a five-point scale from "strongly approve" to "strongly disapprove." It was found that 78 per cent of the illustrations were approved by a majority of the res- pondents. Other findings included: 1] male subjects were generally more receptive than female subjects to the pictures; 2] pictorial ap- proval was in proportion to the increasing occupational status of the respondents; 3] the pictures were most favorably received by members of community organizations, somewhat less favorably by community leaders, and least favorably by non-participants; and 4] subjects having at least one year of college education reacted more favorably to the pictures than those with less education. It was con- cluded that the respondents were most receptive to the pictures depicting eminent individuals who enhanced the Negro image rather than to those which portrayed hardships and privations endured by the race. Illustrations of the twentieth century were generally most favorably accepted; those of the slavery era were least favorably received. The purposes of the study by Merrill and Brown (271) were to determine the number of different foreign publications of which college students were aware, the names of the foreign publications cited most often by the students, and the differences in the awareness of the foreign publications among the students majoring in the four academic areas. Twenty-five college students were randomly selected from each of the following academic majors: political science, journalism, sociology, and English. Each subject was asked to state the names of publications of which he was aware for 20 countries which had well developed presses or which had been prominent in the news immediately prior to the study period. Only two foreign publications, Pravda and The Times of London, were cited by as many as 60 per cent of the students surveyed. Other publications named by between 10 and 27 per cent of the subjects were, in descending order, Le Monde (France), Izvestia (Soviet Union), Punch and The Guardian (Great Britain), Paris Match (France), Der Spiegal and Die Welt (West Germany). The entire group of subjects named 71 publications from 15 countries, with the journalism students naming the most (49), followed by sociology students (28). Of the 71 pub- lications, 49 were newspapers and 22, magazines or periodicals. As</page><page sequence="43">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 173 a group, these subjects were more knowledgable about publications in Western Europe and the Soviet Union than in other parts of the world. The question D. P. Adams (4) sought to answer was the following: Is the full potential of U. S. magazines to communicate with readers being realized in foreign editions circulated in Latin countries? The responses of 23 Latin students from 16 countries to a pre-coded mailed questionnaire were studied. The findings, which agreed in general with those of other studies, were: high Latin readership of magazines from the United States; media source of information (the study showed newspapers as the single most im- portant source of information about current events, radio second, and magazines third to fifth); specific magazines were read with Life, Time, Selecciones (The Readers Digest) and Vision being the magazines most frequently mentioned. Subjects consistently ranked advertisements in U. S. magazines higher than those in Latin Ameri- can magazines on liked qualities such as receiver involvement, origi- nality, and creativity. When the subjects rated the truthfulness of U. S. magazine coverage of eight conditions in both sections of the hemisphere, the total response showed a heavy weighting in favor of fairly to very truthful in most conditions. In both sectors of the hemisphere most subjects consistently approved the magazine treat- ment of educational conditions and disapproved the treatment of social conditions. Academicians and newsmen evaluated the American press on 12 assertions in a study by D. B. Johnson (199). University per- sonnel represented all the major academic disciplines. Vietnam war news was the subject of the evaluation. The professors agreed with six of the statements; newsmen, eight. Quotations from the partici- pants were included in the report. III-13 Newspaper publication The elite press, according to Merrill (270), is comprised of a small number of concerned, knowledgeable, and serious newspapers found in 15 to 20 nations. The characteristics of the free elite press as delineated by Merrill included the following: they contained a minimum of specialized jargon, had clarity of expression, editorials that were strong, vital, outspoken, knowledgeable, thoughtful, and thought-provoking, and exhibited a concern for the future, a con- tinuity of purpose, and evidence of cosmopolitanism. The investiga- tion included the findings of a survey conducted in 1964 of 26</page><page sequence="44">174 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 professors of international communication concerned with criteria to be used in rating a newspaper in the top twenty quality papers of the world. Criteria named the most times by this panel included: an emphasis on political, economic, and cultural news and views, a long tradition of freedom and editorial courage, political and eco- nomic independence, a strong editorial page and/or section given over to opinion and interpretive essays, and staff enterprise in obtain- ing and writing news and commentary. From the criteria, Merrill concluded that the American panel of journalists defined the elite press as a general newspaper, not one that specialized in a certain type of material, saw the international quality newspaper as a free (libertarian) journal, unattached to and uncensored by government, and thought a quality paper must stress politics, economics, and cul- ture on an international basis. Merrill developed a structure to cate- gorize 100 newspapers into four levels of eliteness. The ten news- papers placed into the primary elite group (those of highest quality) were The New York Times, Neue Zurcher Zeitung (Zurich), Le Monde (Paris), The Guardian (London/Manchester), The Times (London), Pravda (Moscow), Jen-min Jih-apo (Peking), Borba (Bel- grade), Observatore Romano (Vatican City), ABC (Madrid). The common denominators of the foregoing were identified as seriousness of purpose and tone, and high readership among influential people. Profiles of newspapers which represent the elite press in various parts of the world were given by Merrill. Students in a journalism history class at the University of Georgia studied the trends of 33 daily newspapers in Georgia in the 1960's. Hynds (191) reported the findings. The state's dailies were placed into two categories: 13 papers in the six largest cities of Georgia and 20 papers in 19 medium-sized or smaller cities. Among the apparent trends were the shifts among the small city dailies to offset printing, the use of computers for production and other uses, and improved and expanded reader services in both small and large papers. In their editorials most of the large city papers and many of the small city ones took stands on public issues; they became more politically independent during this period than they had been be- fore. Most of the dailies increased their circulations in the sixties; increasing costs caused an increase in flatline advertising rates and subscription prices. Three dailies began operation during this decade, two of them as rivals. From his study of editorial cartoons, Carl (65) concluded that there was poor communication between cartoonists and the popu-</page><page sequence="45">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 175 lations surveyed. Editorial cartoon samples from newspapers were interpreted by a random sample of people in two small towns and one university city. The interpretations of the cartoons by the sub- jects were evaluated against meanings submitted by the cartoonists. Responses were classified into one of three categories: those in total agreement, those in partial agreement, and those in disagreement with the cartoonists' intended meaning. The responses in the latter category far outnumbered the combined total of the other two. In the survey of small towns approximately 15 per cent of the responses were in accord with the intended meaning, 15 per cent, in slight accord, and 70 per cent in complete disagreement. In the university city, more than 63 per cent of subjects failed to get the cartoonists' intended meanings. The relationship between persuasive materials in Latin American newspapers and the opinions of readers on the same sub- ject was the concern of Pierce (307). A major source of data was an opinion survey commissioned by the U. S. Information Agency in four Latin American cities (Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Caracas, and Rio de Janeiro) in the winter and spring of 1963-64. The question- naire included approximately fifty questions on political and economic matters, both domestic and international, and also sought demo- graphic and media use data on the respondents. Pierce also used a content analysis of 12 newspapers published in the four cities during and immediately before the time of the opinion survey, and classified their editorial statements as favorable or unfavorable on each issue. The findings included the following: 1] editorial stands served as predictors of the majority public sentiment on topics concerned with international politics, although they were not consistently casual factors; 2] more press-public agreement was found on new issues than on old ones, on peripheral issues than on crucial ones, and on personality issues than on abstract ones; 3] iden- tification with particular newspapers had a bearing on the holdings of certain opinions in the case of high-prestige newspapers but not in the case of mass-appeal papers; and 4] neither literacy nor political stability in a nation was found to have a relationship with the rate of agreement between the press and the public. A surprising finding was the paucity of editorial leadership evinced by Latin American newspapers on matters which were important to the welfare of their countries. The survey of daily newspaper publishers in the United States conducted by Haskins and Feinberg (167) dealt with the</page><page sequence="46">176 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY 9 Winter 1970 V/2 future of newspaper publication, especially in regard to research needs and the conduct of research. Among the findings of the ques- tionnaire survey were the following: over 87 per cent of the respond- ents indicated that the most useful role of newspaper research was the solving of long-range, industry-wide problems; the respondents thought that the area of greatest changes in the next twenty years and the area of greatest opportunity would be that of mechanics, production, and technology, when asked what one research study they would most like to see performed in the future, one third of the respondents indicated studies on mechanical, production, and tech- nological problems, and one third selected circulation and marketing. Universities were most favored to do research on journalism educa- tion, editing/content/selection, reporting/writing, and typography; universities and industry-wide research agencies were equally favored to investigate competitive media and newspaper image problems. Also included in the survey were two methodological tests concerned with mail study techniques. III-14 The foreign press The colonial newspaper was one of the principal means by which the English libertarian tradition was transmitted to the Ameri- can colonies, according to Huxford (190). In his study the early development of colonial newspapers was traced from the publication of the first colonial newspaper, Publick Occurrences, Both Foreign and Domestick, whose only issue appeared on September 25, 1690, to the publications appearing at the end of the eighteenth century. Newspapers were important in acquainting colonists with the ideas of English writers, especially the Old Whigs, who supplied colonial papers with direct quotations, paraphrasing, versions of Old Whig sentiments, and summaries of Old Whig books. The author pointed out numerous ways in which colonial newspapers spread libertarian ideas. In his survey of the Australian metropolitan daily news- paper, Holden (179) related that Australian journalism began with a government-censored weekly which was printed by a convict on March 5, 1803. Today, by contrast, the Australian press is among the freest in the world. Although the number of general-interest newspapers published in Australia declined from 686 in 1960 to 615 in 1966-67, many Australian newspapers were noted for their longev- ity, approximately half of the metropolitan dailies and many country and surburban newspapers having celebrated their centennials.</page><page sequence="47">Summary of reading research WEwTRAUB, et al. 177 Furthermore, total circulations have mounted, with one newspaper being published for every three Australians. By Australian tradition the morning papers are serious publications which give sober cover- age to the important news; the afternoon papers are feature papers, weighted toward entertainment. News from overseas is provided through the Australian Associated Press; the Australian United Press and the Queensland Country Press send domestic news to the Aus- tralian newspapers. There was also much reciprocal service among news-gathering units throughout Australia. The two chief sources of Australian newspaper income, as in the United States, were cited as advertising and newspaper sales. When compared, there were only relatively small differences between Australian and American news- papers. The German magazine originated in England in the eight- eenth century, according to Haacke (152). At first, narratives and articles from well known English magazines were incorporated into German periodicals and when these no longer satisfied readers, imi- tations were offered, written and printed in Germany but composed entirely in English. Unabridged translations of English mores maga- zines were followed by the publication of new periodicals in the form of digests, imitations of the English penny magazine, and illus- trated publications. The term magazine in England came to denote a periodical which provided universal information and pleasant enter- tainment; the term was introduced in Germany during the enlighten- ment. When the magazine was at its prime in Germany in the eighteenth century, it took priority over the newspaper as the leading communications medium. Different kinds of German magazines dating from the earliest publications up to the present were described by the investigator. Haacke concluded that of all types of German periodi- cals, it was the magazine which first dispensed a balanced program of both entertainment and information to the broad masses of people and it continues to do so today. The primary purpose of the study by Rosengarten (334) was to analyze the Resistance press of Italy from 1919 to 1945 in terms of how its ideas and programs reflected various ideological com- ponents of anti-fascist thought, how these ideas were linked to resistance movements in other countries, and how they influenced the politics of postwar Italy. Rosengarten found that the history of the Italian anti-fascist press tended to fall into three periods: 1919 to 1926, which witnessed a progressively militant fascist assault on freedom of the press; 1926 to the first years of World War II, when</page><page sequence="48">178 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 anti-fascist journalism either carried on clandestine propaganda in Italy or continued to challenge the legitimacy of the fascist regime as political exiles; and 1943 to 1945, the period of armed resistance in which over five hundred underground newspapers and thousands of pamphlets and manifestoes appeared. Included in this well-docu- mented report are descriptions of the legal and extralegal methods with which the fascist regime crushed the opposition press, the atti- tudes and ideas underlying the fascist assault on the freedom of the press, the political ideas and moral issues that guided the anti- fascist press from 1919 to the early years of World War II, the devel- opment of various currents of anti-fascist thought and action during the years 1925 and 1939 as found in the clandestine newspapers circulated in Italy and in numerous publications produced by groups of anti-fascist emigres in Paris, a systematic analysis of the ideas, ideals, and political programs of the underground press during the period of armed resistance from 1943 to 1945, the methodology of underground journalism, and the ideas and ideals shared in common by the five principal anti-fascist parties. III-15 History of the American press Within the framework of a changing economy after the Civil War, the daily newspaper industry also changed. Knights (219) found that the following trends, visible in the industry in 1880, began at least as early as 1865-68: a marked western growth of dailies (following population shifts), tendencies toward political inde- pendence, evening publication, and changed competitive conditions. Using federal census figures for 1860 and 1870, he interpolated to 1868 and estimated a total of 497 dailies with a total circulation of 2,200,000 for that year. This was a growth of more than 110 newspapers over 1860 figures. Basal competition (in which dailies drew on the same market area for readers and advertisers) was an outstanding characteristic of the post-Civil War period, but neither political competition (in which the dailies claimed the same political affiliation) nor modal competition (in which they appeared at the same time each day) necessarily was present. There appeared to be a close relationship between the size of a place and the number of dailies it supported. The daily newspaper of 1868 was primarily an urban phenomenon with many communities of more than 10,000 persons supporting two daily newspapers. Berg and Berg (33) focused on the role of the New York City press in creating and consolidating public opinion during the</page><page sequence="49">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 179 period immediately preceding the Spanish-American War. While some newspapers were attempting to maintain conservative stand- ards during this period, a sensational type of journalism appeared in New York City. Newspapers found it difficult to maintain reader interest; as a result, they gradually resorted to the practice of specu- lation and a variety of novel techniques. The effectiveness of pictures (artist's drawings, photographs, and cartoons) and the influence of headlines (size, simplicity in wording, organization) were noted. The reporters of this study concluded that the yellow press of the 1890's left an inescapable heritage to the American civilization; however, the comparisons of journalistic techniques then and now were not so important as were the effects of those practices on popular thinking. The history and development of the comic strip were dis- cussed by Couperie and Horn (85) who wrote their book in conjunc- tion with the first international exhibition of comic art held at the Louvre in Paris. The book, fully illustrated with noteworthy types and trends of comic art, recorded the development of the comic strip, particularly in America. After photography was developed, the comic strip appeared in 1889 in France and in 1897 in the United States. The animated cartoons, the movie, and the comic strip were born simultaneously. The comic strip was foreshadowed in Europe by a profusion of picture stories which appeared alone or as illustrations of a text. The comic strip grew and proliferated in all directions before anyone even thought of giving it a name. Originally comic strips were essentially humorous, but a great variety of themes soon developed. For a long while the principal pictorial series were reserved exclusively for the Sunday supplements of the major daily news- papers. The first genuine daily comic, "Mr. A. Mutt" ("Mutt and Jeff"), appeared in 1907. During the years 1900 to 1910, considered by some to be the Golden Age of the comic strip, cartoonists were able to give full rein to their originality, talent, and imagination. Within the diversity of styles that characterized the comic strip at this time, two opposing intellectual currents were already coming to light among the cartoonists, one group considering entertainment as the goal of the comic strip, and the second group wishing to intellectualize the comics. In the next period the adventure strip was in vogue with such well known characters as Tarzan, Superman, Dick Tracy, Flash Gordon, and Prince Valiant making their first appearance. The first genuine comic book was published in 1933 and led to the first com- mercial comic book published in 1934. The first original comic book appeared in 1935 and contained a variety of humorous stories. The</page><page sequence="50">180 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 focus of the comic book changed during the Second World War and took on a propaganda role. Included in the text are discussions about the creators of the comic characters, the influences on each, the ma- terials they drew from, and the forms and styles they used. An examination is also made of the people who read comic strips and their reasons for reading them. A history of American political cartoons was presented by Hess and Kaplan (177). The origin of American political cartoons was in 1747 when printer Benjamin Franklin designed "Non Votis" to illustrate his pamphlet, Plain Truth. The American cartoon at first was similar to European models and displayed little originality until well into the Civil War period. Even at this time, most of the cartoonists were foreign born and trained. Partisan use of cartoons by political parties, candidates, and leaders has had a long history. Hess and Kaplan described cartoons used in relation to important historical movements, such as women's suffrage, prohibition, and wars. They also discussed cartoons of well known people and their reactions to the cartoons. The breakthrough for the newspaper car- toon came just before the presidential election of 1884, and by the early 1900's literally hundreds of newspapers throughout the country needed political cartoonists. Today there are approximately one hun- dred full time editorial cartoonists. Many were described as illustrat- ing the news rather than molding it. More experimentation is being done at the present period than at any time since World War I. Hess and Kaplan concluded that because today's skillful professional car- toonists are in their twenties and thirties, the outlook for the art of political cartooning appeared to be a promising one. III-16 Research techniques The purpose of two studies was to develop evaluation instru- ments for areas in sociological aspects of reading. J. A. Anderson (10) designed a study to provide a means of comparing scores of similar dimensions of connotative meaning found in pictorial, print, and aural media. To achieve his purpose, the investigation determined whether consistent dimensions of judgmental behavior concerning statements found in a given medium could be identified with differ- ent measuring instruments and whether the dimensions could be reliably reproduced in different media. Each of 768 subjects re- sponded to one of four concepts presented through one medium on fifty semantic differential (SD) scales. The data from these scales were first factor analyzed, and the resulting 35 scales of the visual</page><page sequence="51">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 181 medium were selected for the construction of a comparison test, which was developed as Likert-type (LT) scales. The mean scores of the LT scales and of the SD scales were correlated. The Semantic Space Analyzer (SSA) was developed to determine whether the semantic differential results could be replicated in an evaluation in- strument other than a paper and pencil test. The analyzer permitted subjects to select adjectives to match slides which were comprised of the SD scales' statements. Data collected from a smaller number of subjects taking the SD scales, the LT scales, and the SSA scales were analyzed through factor analysis. Two factors resulted: structural (whole, perfect, formed) and esthetic evaluation (colorful, beautiful, interesting). The 15 scales loading on the two factors in all three media were the basis for the comparison of the three media. The one major finding appeared to be that messages that are effective in one medium will not necessarily be effective when presented through another medium. Among his conclusions, Anderson stated that media related to each other differently on different dimensions of judgment, i.e., the written was most like the pictorial in the structure factor, and the spoken was most like the pictorial in the esthetic factor. In the second study, Lynch, Nettleship, and Carlson (249) developed the HQdex (human quotient index) to determine human interest in reading. The focus was on the connotative or affective aspects of human interest rather than on the denotative or cognitive aspects. Thirteen semantic differential scales, based upon the results of factor analysis research, were selected for measurement purposes. Although the foregoing scales provided a means of obtaining individ- ual judgments of human interest, they did not provide an index of the degree of human interest in the material read since people differ in their standards of judging human interest. Therefore, the HQdex, a procedure which would permit each individual to be his own control was developed. Studies were conducted to determine the validity and applicability of the HQdex as a measure of human interest, to see whether the HQdex would differentiate between messages categorized on some other basis as to high and low in human interest, and to ascertain if the HQdex would differentiate similarly between levels of human interest for different contents. Seven identifiable factors emerged which represented different dimensions of human interest content and were tentatively labeled novelty, leisure, complexity, per- sonalism, adversity, achievement, and orderliness. Using the seven typologies, the investigators compared ten stories which were judged highest and ten judged lowest in human interest on each of the</page><page sequence="52">182 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 factors. The results of the comparison in which an analysis of vari- ance technique was applied showed that the mean HQdex scores were significantly higher for stories of high as opposed to low human interest levels; this evidence, therefore, gave support to the validity of the HQdex as a measure of human interest. In addition, the HQdex differentiated between high and low human interest levels among the seven content factors, thereby supporting the general applicability of the HQdex as a measure of human interest. A related purpose of the study was to employ some of the attributes which were highly related with human interest judgments to derive an indirect measure of the HQdex scores. Thirty-six selections, representing most and least human in quality on the seven factors isolated earlier, were analyzed and various stylistic features were computed. The resulting variables and the HQdex scores for each passage were submitted to correlation and factor analysis. The investigators found that an index of passage complexity with the ratio of syllables per 100 words was the best single correlate; with everything else being equal, the fewer syllables per 100 words, the greater was the degree of human interest in the passage. The other principal correlates of human interest in writing were some index of emotiveness, an index of lexical diversity, and some index of personalism. Using these four attributes as covariates and the HQdex score as the main variate (multiple correlation and regression analyses), the researchers ob- tained a multiple correlation of .73. The four correlates explained 53 per cent of the variance in the HQdex. A third study concerned with research techniques in the sociology of reading was that of Brunner and Carroll (58) who studied the effect of prior notification by letter on the refusal rate in household surveys. A form introductory letter was developed and mailed under two letterheads. Two samples were chosen from a city directory; one half of the first sample received a letter with a relative- ly new consulting firm's letterhead, and one half of the second sample received a letter with a well-known university's letterhead. Sampling points were randomly selected; each fifth residence listing was sel- ected as a sampling unit and was randomly assigned to a letter group (to receive prior notification by letter) or non-letter group (to receive no letter). Interviewers made calls upon both types of sampling units. In addition, respondents were requested to complete a ques- tionnaire dealing with sensitive information. Data in regard to the differences between the completion rate and the request rate for</page><page sequence="53">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 183 the letter and non-letter groups in each of the surveys as well as between the two letter groups were tested statistically. The first hypothesis was rejected, i.e., that a prior letter regardless of the communicator would significantly reduce the refusal rate in fixed address field studies. The second hypothesis was sustained, i.e., that given a prior letter from an identified source, the nature of the source itself would significantly affect the refusal rate. Of those who received the letter with the university letterhead, 72.5 per cent com- pleted the interview while only 52.3 per cent of the control group did. The differences between the experimental consulting letterhead and the control (non-letter) were not statistically significant. The third hypothesis was also rejected: those respondents who received prior notification by letter would be significantly more willing to respond to sensitive questions than those who did not receive a letter. III-17 Social and psychological factors related to reading The report by Rees and Paisley (320) dealt with three broad classes of information channels (formal adult education, mass media, and other people) chosen by adults for information. Data were ob- tained through personal interviews. By means of multiple regression analysis, social and psychological predictors of channel preference were determined. The seven social predictors found formed two groups: life-cycle (age and sex) and life-style (education, income, occupation, marital status, and number of organizational member- ships). Psychological predictors included achievement motivation, perception of practical education in the mass media, and attitude toward new media and educational technology. The results of the study included the following: readership of newspapers, all maga- zines, and newsmagazines was best predicted by life-style attributes with education and economic status among the strongest predictors of newspaper reading. The differences in newspaper reading were greatest across income levels, with a larger per cent of those in the highest income group reading two or more daily newspapers than those in the lowest income group. Seven variables were significant predictors of overall magazine readership: education, sex, perception of practical education in media, attitude toward new media and/or technology, number of organizational memberships, income, and age. Newsmagazine readership (Time, Newsweek, and U. S. News and World Report) was predicted by education, income, achievement</page><page sequence="54">184 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 motivation, and sex. The predictors of book readership, in order of rank, were education, sex, achievement motivation, occupation, atti- tude toward new media and/or technology, number of organizational memberships, and marital status. During the week preceding the inter- view, 58 per cent of the subjects had used one or more reference books. The strongest predictor for the foregoing activity was attitude toward new media and/or technology. Education was the strongest predictor of frequency of public library use; other predictors were age, attitude toward new media and/or technology, number of organiza- tional memberships, and achievement motivation. Only psychological predictors were found for "serious" television viewing: perception of practical education in media, achievement motivation, and attitude toward new media and/or technology. IV. Physiology and psychology of reading An investigation of general theoretical interest was reported by Kling (216). He examined Holmes' substrata-factor theory in rela- tion to Bertalanffy's seven attributes of an organismic open systems model and Werner's addition of an eighth attribute. First, Kling showed structural similarity and internal consistency between the two models while recognizing that the Holmes' analysis was only a first approximation. Second, using scores on nine tests or sub-tests of the Stanford Achievement Tests for 120 students, Kling calculated inter- correlation coefficients. Nine substrata analyses used each content area as a criterion in order to determine the proportion of intra- individual variance accounted for by the others. His presentation of the data for Power of Reading and Vocabulary in Isolation enabled him to approximate the reciprocal interaction. Specifically, using the Holmes procedure, Kling calculated three levels of proportional vari- ance from which he concluded that 73.84 per cent of Power of Read- ing could be accounted for by Vocabularly in Isolation (47.55 per cent), Geography (17.38 per cent), and Arithmetic Reasoning (8.91 per cent), while about 24 per cent of the variance could not be accounted for in this study. Then, using Vocabulary in Isolation as a criterion, he found that Power of Reading contributes 34.35 per cent, English Literature, 26.45 per cent, and grammar, 19.97 per cent of the variance to account for a total of 80.77 per cent. Based on the six assumptions made, Kling concluded that his data sup- ported the conclusion that subject matter areas could be understood as sub-systems of the open systems theory.</page><page sequence="55">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 185 IV-1 Physiology of reading All of the investigations reported this year dealt with vision and reading. Some of the reports classified in other sections are closely related to those that follow. Robinson (325) tested 820 pupils, almost equally distributed among the first eight grades, with an extensive battery of commercial and experimental tests of visual screening. The Primary Mental Abili- ties Test as well as three tests of reading achievement were admin- istered. About 990 cofficients of intercorrelation and a factor analysis were calculated for each grade. Eight factors were found at each grade level. One factor was reading; the other seven factors were vision factors and these failed to load significantly on the reading factor. Therefore, no patterns or constellations of vision factors could be related to reading. Further examination of the data com- pared the mean visual scores of 63 good with 60 poor readers. Poor readers were characterized by greater amounts of hyperopia and binocular incoordination. Both test-retest validity and reliability, compared to refraction, were reported for each commercial battery. Rosenbloom (333) carried out an extensive visual examina- tion of 40 retarded readers and a matched group of average readers. Both the critical ratio and chi square revealed no significant differ- ences in the proportion of pupils in each group exhibiting 1.00 per cent or more of aniseikonia. However, both groups exhibited unex- pectedly large proportions of clinically significant amounts of anisei- konia: experimental, 25 per cent and control, 17.5 per cent. Further examination revealed suppression of one eye on either the Spache Binocular Reading Test or the Hand-Eye Coordination Tests. The author concluded that the suppression may have been a compensa- tion for aniseikonia. After an extensive review of the research dealing with visual factors and reading or learning disability, Lawson (231) reported on a study in progress. Among 82 cases of learning disability, 38 (46 per cent) were found to have abnormalities of vision. The two groups were compared by various computer analyses on 19 behavioral vari- ables. The latter included total, partial, and sub-test scores on the WISC, social quotient, four of the Detroit tests, oral and silent read- ing measures, and the Heath Rails. The F ratio for the two groups with learning disability revealed a significant difference only for level of comprehension and the Heath Rails. With multiple discriminant analysis, the greatest difference appeared in the Heath Rails. Other vectors of difference, in order, were Block Design, Picture Completion,</page><page sequence="56">186 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 Picture Arrangement, Visual Span for Objects, Goodenough I.Q., Detroit Designs, and Paragraph Meaning. Factor analyses of the data for the two groups revealed five factors. Factor I, various in- tellectual abilities, included essentially the same abilities but with differing magnitudes of weights. Factor II consisted of the verbal functions, including reading scores, and differed somewhat in the two groups. The aggregate of findings led to the conclusion that oph- thalmological information is highly relevant to learning disabilities. Starnes (372) applied optometric examination techniques to third-grade pupils and obtained an F ratio for the differences be- tween means of good and poor readers for a number of tests. He found no significant differences between mean scores of the two groups on tests of visual acuity or phorias. Good readers tended to be nearsighted and poor readers farsighted. Significant differences, favoring the good readers, were found on the Winter Haven, Circus Form Board, Tactual Forms, 6 Figure Split Form Board, and a com- posite score of perceptual abilities. At the college level, Silbiger (356) used the T/O tester with the accompanying targets at far and near distances, and a special test of fixation disparity. Subjects were samples from the top and bottom thirds of freshmen who took the speed of comprehension section of the Comparative English Test (CET). A comparison of the mean scores of the two groups, using the t test, revealed no significant differences at far distances. At near distance, there were significant differences in the acuity of the inferior eye, lateral movement, and three of the four tests of fixation disparity. Stevens and Adams (375) identified 22 emmetropes and 9 myopes entering a rapid reading course. Each group was subdivided into slow and fast readers. Near the end of 18 lessons of one hour each, the average free-reading rate based on three selections was compared with the average of three "equated" selections prior to in- struction. Analysis of variance yielded significant F's showing little difference between the emmetropes and myopes at pre-test, but in- creasing differences throughout the instructional periods. Fast readers at the pre-test period also made greater gains but at the end of in- struction visual acuity correlated higher with reading speed than did the initial rate. Park (303) reviewed the research dealing with vision and reading before reporting on results based on the Electroencepholo- graph (EEG) for 100 dyslexic children. Abnormal EEG's were found in 36 per cent. Comparison of that group with the group with normal</page><page sequence="57">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 187 EEG's revealed some differences. More with abnormal EEG's showed a build-up during the first three minutes of hyperventilation; and photic responses appeared in all normals and only half of abnormals. The abnormal cases were divided into four groups on the basis of the EEG data: positive spikes, occipital slow, fronto-temporal slow, and epileptiform discharges. Computer analysis showed that selected duction findings and the WISC performance test helped to separate the normals and the four abnormal groups. Those with positive spikes were brightest, most retarded in reading (based on potential), had high BPI values and high Vineland scores. The normal EEG group had average I.Q.'s, were the best readers, and had the most normal social and visual data as well as no evidence of organicity. The occipital slow group were the poorest readers with the lowest potential. They showed the highest neutrophil count, highest adjust- ment, and low tension and Vineland ratings. The fronto-temporal group was similar to the last but also with lowest scores on duction tests and seemed to show organic signs. The discharge group showed organicity with highest PBI values and neutropenia accompanied by low ductions and poor or absent stereopsis. The author concluded that the EEG constitutes a significant technique for the study of dys- lexic children and the results may be related to visual data. Wold (408) asked teachers to complete a visual symptom questionnaire and to classify pupils as above, below, or average achievers. For the 46 above-average pupils, 1.35 symptoms per pupil were noted; for the average, 2.90 per pupil, and for below-average achievers, 8.44 symptoms were found. The refractive examination revealed that above-average students tended toward myopia while below-average tended toward emmetropia and mild hyperopia. No significant differences were found in the phorias. The distribution of scores on the Developmental Copy Forms tended to support a rela- tionship between this test and achievement. Shearron (350) compared the reading scores, measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, of boys classified as mild, medium, and strong in color deficiency. His subjects, in the primary grades, were secured by screening with the AO H-R-R Plates. He found 5.67 per cent of boys and .32 per cent of girls to be color deficient. The percentage of color deficient Negro boys was 3.12 compared to 6.83 per cent of white boys who were color deficient. When the white color-deficient boys were compared with controls, no significant differences in reading achievement were found. Likewise no significant differences were found, in reading achievement, among</page><page sequence="58">188 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 the mild, medium, and strong color-deficient groups. The author concluded that there was no significant relationship between color deficiency and reading achievement. Schuster, Karas, and Antonelli (347) collected data on read- ing distance during an experiment on legibility of printing. Subjects were 78 adults with 20/20 vision, corrected or uncorrected. They read single characters in 10-point type. The range of distances was 7.5 to 28.0 inches, with a median of 15.8 inches and a mean of 16.2 inches. IV-2 Sex differences Only one study dealt directly with sex differences in learning to read. Stanchfield (371) arranged eight pairs of first grades so that the experimental classes contained three fourths boys or three fourths girls. The boys were taught alone one period each day. At the beginning and end of the school year, the Harsh-Solberg Survey of Primary Reading Development was administered. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differences at the end of the year, either in achievement level or in gain stores made by the sex-segregated and the coeducational groups. Teachers handling only boys became aware of their active, aggressive behavior, relatively poor verbal levels, in- adequacies in auditory discrimination and listening skills, short attention spans, lower levels of motivation to read, and lack of inter- est in the content of readers. A second study used materials especially designed to interest boys. Again there was no significant difference in the achievement of boys during the year. A third year, teachers used special materials prepared in a summer workshop, accompanied by manuals for the teachers. Using these materials both the boys and girls in the experimental groups scored higher than those in the control groups. No sex data were reported for this study. IV-3 Intellectual abilities and reading Two investigations dealt with the behavior of poor readers on intelligence tests. Beck (28) examined the WISC total and part scores of 71 clinic clients with special attention to communality of relatively high and low scores on each of the sub-tests. She found no significant differences between Full Scale I.Q.'s or between the Performance and Verbal I.Q.'s among the sex or age groups. The ranked means of each sub-test revealed that the highest ranks were achieved on Comprehension and Vocabulary. Lowest ranks were found on Coding, Arithmetic, and Digit Span. The conclusion, from</page><page sequence="59">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 189 the sub-test scores, was that these retarded readers were not deficient in general language ability. Houston and Otto (185) used the WISC as a criterion to determine the relative effectiveness of the Slossen Intelligence Test (SIT) and three forms of the Quick Test (QT) with retarded readers, ages 7 to 14, of normal intelligence or better. After the tests were given, raw scores were converted to M.A.'s and ratio I.Q.'s were cal- culated. It was found that the mean QT-I.Q. was about four points lower than that on the SIT or WISC. Intercorrelations among the scores revealed that the SIT correlated higher with the full scale WISC (.60) and the WISC-V (.64) than did the combined QT (r=.48, .48). The reliabilities of the three forms of the QT differed with the raw score reliability higher than that of the I.Q. The reliabili- ty of the combined QT raw scores was .93, while the reliability of I.Q.'s was .79. The estimated reliability of the SIT was .96. The shared variance of the WISC-V and the SIT was 41 per cent in contrast to the WISC-V and the combined forms of the QT which was 23 per cent. Pezzoli and Frase (306) varied the associative strength, direction, and number of words in syllogisms to determine the effect on deductive reasoning. Exposure time between Premises 1 and 2, and between Premise 2 and the conclusion were varied from 2.0 to 5.0 to 10.0 seconds. Thus, a 3 (time) x 3 (verbiage) x 3 (association value) x 2 (figure) factorial design with repeated measures on the last two items was applied to the number of errors. The subjects were 54 college students. Analysis revealed no significant effects of ver- biage or time intervals. However, there was a significant figure effect (errors in the R-equivalent paradigm were greater than in the S- equivalent). Associative strength was significant with a greater number of errors when association was present. The last two factors interacted. The investigators concluded that mediated associations have a significant effect on deductive reasoning. Henderson and Long (173) made four studies of fifth-grade pupils to determine characteristics of those who used divergent thinking. The Reading Decisions Test was constructed for this pur- pose. The subjects read a title and looked at a picture and then rated 30 potentially feasible outcomes for the story on a five-point scale. After the first half of the story was read, a second set of 30 outcomes were rated. The procedure was altered slightly in the fourth experiment. In each experiment the pupils differed somewhat in read- ing and general ability so that comparisons of open-mindedness could be made in relation to superior, average, and inferior readers. Differ-</page><page sequence="60">190 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 ent analyses combined to show that in three of the four samples, the superior readers had greater recognition of possible outcomes. In the fourth study where the ability range was greatest, the relationship between open-mindedness and reading, corrected for intelligence, was curvilinear. Both the high and low groups had higher scores than did the average group. IV-4 Modes of learning Morency (281) tested pupils upon entering first grade, and at the end of second and third grades to determine changes in audi- tory and visual perception scores which were related to reading. She used the Wepman Auditory Discrimination Test, an experimental test of auditory memory, experimental tests of visual memory and dis- crimination, and the Metropolitan Readiness and Achievement Tests. The t test showed significant (.01) improvement in both auditory and visual perceptual scores, except in visual memory. Coefficients of intercorrelation between visual and auditory gains were not signi- ficant, showing differential modality development. Coefficients of correlation between the first-grade auditory test scores and third- grade achievement were low but significant. Likewise the coefficients for the visual test scores were low but significantly related to all but language usage. Braun (50) studied the effects of both modality and interest appeal of words on learning, and retention for 24 hours, of four words. Fifteen subjects were assigned to each of 16 learning task treatments, combining high or low ability level, auditory or auditory- visual modality, and boy- or girl-interest words. Ability was deter- mined by the Harris-Goodenough Drawing Test. The boy- and girl- interest words were selected by graduate students and faculty from the 264 colorful content words in the Murphy Word List and were validated by first-grade pupils. They were matched for length, con- figural elements, compound parts, and intra-list confusability. All words were illustratable nouns. The auditory treatment involved showing the word, saying it aloud, and having the subject echo the response. Auditory-visual treatment was the same except that an illustration accompanied each word. Learning and test cycles continued alternately until two successive test trials in a maximum of fifteen cycles were correctly identified. The retention test was given only once. Analysis of variance, convariance, and orthogonal or inde- pendent comparisons were made. F ratios for treatment effects with individual words revealed greater significance for retention than</page><page sequence="61">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 191 for number of words learned. Sex differences showed that the learning of boy-words favored boys and girl-words favored girls in every in- stance. All significant differences favored high ability groups. Differ- ences consistently favored the auditory treatment of both boys and girls with more pronounced effects on low ability groups. The reten- tion scores for boys were especially enhanced by the auditory treat- ment. Busby and Hurd (61) studied reaction time as it related to reading in a random sample of pupils from grades two, four, and six. Reaction stimuli were a red light, a green light, a high tone of 1200 cps, and a low tone of 400 cps, embedded in a series. Response was by lifting a finger from a key. Each subject had 198 trials. Shift- ing reaction time was not independent of reaction time in either auditory or visual channels. Auditory-visual reaction time was not significantly related to intelligence or reading achievement as meas- ured by the vocabulary or comprehension sections of the California Achievement Tests. Auditory-visual reaction time decreased with age but was unrelated to sex, race, or socio-economic status. Jester (198) varied rates of presentation of the Davis Read- ing Tests from 200 to 400 words per minute with auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimulation. Correlation coefficients among the scores obtained in the three presentations were calculated at speed incre- ments of 50 wpm. Coefficients at 200 and 250 wpm between auditory and visual presentation were high (.77 and .78) but declined with increased rate to -.12 at 400 wpm. When correlation coefficients were corrected for attentuation, the same relationships remained. However, with increased speed of presentation, the coefficients were reduced far less when auditory and visual presentations were related to audiovisual presentations. The author suggested that as pressure increased, subjects selected their preferred modality. Durrell (105) compared reading with listening in grades one through eight, using three to four thousand pupils per grade. Listening exceeded reading vocabulary, on the basis of raw scores, until grade eight when they were equal. However the relative gain in reading vocabulary was continuous. For sentences and paragraphs, reading surpassed listening first at grade six and was superior there- after. The author illustrated the usefulness of equating listening to reading grade scores rather than using percentiles or stanines. Kahn and Birch (204) explored the relation of visual and auditory discrimination skills, rote memory, and verbal labels to auditory-visual integrative functioning. As a measure of the integra-</page><page sequence="62">192 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 tive task, they used twenty auditory-tap patterns from which each subject in grades two through six selected the visual equivalent from three sets of dots. The test previously used by Birch and Belmont was extended by adding ten new items. The test-retest reliability at third grade was .76 and at fifth, it was .90. Reading was measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Tests while the Lorge-Thorndike Intelli- gence Test provided verbal and nonverbal I.Q.'s. With the expanded Auditory-Visual Integration Test, mean scores increased steadily and no asymptote was reached by sixth grade. Distributions at each grade were relatively constant. Coefficients of correlation of the integration test with both vocabulary and comprehension were positive and significant at all grade levels, most being in the range from .42 to .57. Partial correlation, with I.Q. eliminated, yielded somewhat re- duced values (.37 to .49) that were still significant whether or not verbal or nonverbal I.Q. was controlled. From the 350 subjects, the ten scoring highest and ten scoring lowest on the integration test in each grade were given the same test individually four days later, and asked to sing or tap out the rhythms in order to test each modality separately. Most subjects made no errors or very few. Little difference was found between high and low scores suggesting that the problem was not in either modality but in the integrative ability. Immediate memory span, determined by the WISC Digit Span sub-test, correlated insignificantly (.21 to .14) with the integration scores, tending to eliminate this factor. Each subject was asked how he compared the taps he heard with the dots he saw. Forty-eight per cent reported counting, 15 per cent attempted to visualize, 5 per cent had an in- ward sense of body participation, and 32 per cent did not know how they proceeded. Those who attempted to visualize made higher (p &lt; .03) integration scores than those who counted; those who did not know performed as well as those who verbalized by counting. Reynolds, Palmatier, and Ulmer (322) studied input made with output held constant using four sub-groups of 35 each, with reading levels at grade four to six and seven to eight. Twenty stimu- lus words (nouns) were presented orally, visually (word), graphic- ally (picture) or in some combination. All associated responses were written in 100 seconds following exposure. A factor analysis of the items was done to determine the reliablility of the task. The cumula- tive variance associated with the first factor was .757. Differences in fluency due to achievement were not found. Using the Duncan multi- ple range test, the graphic-oral mode produced greatest fluency while</page><page sequence="63">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 193 the graphic and graphic-visual produced the fewest. Moreover, view- ing the treatments in sets showed the spurious effects and the con- clusion was reached that fluency is not a function of mode of pre- sentation in adult literacy training groups. However, only the quan- tity and not the quality of response was treated in this study. A final report by Brooks (55) dealt with the effects of reading on visualization. In experiment 1, either a series of messages describ- ing spatial relations or nonsense materials were presented so that sub- jects either listened, or listened and read simultaneously. The respond- ent was to repeat the message. The subjects reported that they pic- tured the pattern formed by the numbers but not by the nonsense task. A within-subjects analysis showed the material by presentation interaction to be significant (.05) level). The results led to the con- clusion that the reading-listening condition interfered with repeti- tion of spatial materials but not with nonsense materials. In the sec- ond experiment, the output was varied. Subjects learned a message to one verbatim repetition. Then they were asked to say the key words or underline them, as on a multiple choice test. Initial response and inter-response times were recorded. Analysis of the data revealed that the written spatial materials required longer inter-response time than the spoken-spatial, or written or spoken nonsense materials. The author interpreted the findings of the two experiments to mean that reading suppresses spatial organization, possibly due to general over- load. The third experiment was designed to examine this phenome- non. The spoken presentation of each message was accompanied by either the spatial display or the key words alone. Then the message was presented as in experiment 1. Again, output after reading re- quired a longer time than after listening only when the subject was asked to visualize the matrix displayed. The fourth experiment was similar to the third except that the subject was asked to detect an error in a sequence of three words taken from the message, previously presented either by listening or listening-reading, when visualizing or not visualizing the materials. The results confirmed previous findings. One study comparing visual with haptic (kinaesthetic or tactile) pupils was reported by Erickson (118). He used the Success- ive Perception I test with 325 boys. The test required viewing of the parts of a figure to determine if the parts were integrated as a whole. Subjects who correctly identified 20 or more of the 35 patterns were considered visual; 15 to 18, indeterminates, and 13 or below as haptic. Analysis of variance revealed that, on the reading part of the</page><page sequence="64">194 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, the visual group was significantly (.01) superior to the other two groups. Furthermore, the indeterminates were superior to the haptics. Bakker (23) attempted to assess the relative strength of the visual versus the tactile-kinaesthetic modality as it might relate to reading. He used a slide on a 24 cm bar, asking subjects to place the slide at the midpoint either visually or blindfolded by touch. Each condition was given 25 trials; mean deviation of tactile was sub- tracted from mean deviation of visual (VSD). The correlations be- tween the VSD and age and sex were not significant. Within the low I.Q. level, relations between VSD and reading scores were significant but not within the high I.Q. group. IV-5 Experiments in learning Otto (295) selected good and poor readers of average ability in his study of the effect of color on children's learning of a paired- associate task. Equal numbers of boys and girls from each reading level and each grade level were assigned to either a black-and-white or a color presentation of a paired-associate list. The list consisted of five pairs, a common geometric form paired with a consonant-vowel- consonant trigram. The list was learned to a criterion of one correct anticipation of the entire list with serial presentation and one correct anticipation of the entire list with scrambled presentation. Analysis of variance techniques showed that only grade and reading ability effects were significant with serial trials, and none were significant with scrambled trials. Good readers tended to benefit more from the color cues than did poor readers and the benefit tended to increase with grade level. In a second study, Otto (297) examined the interactions among intralist similarity, order of presentation, and color in second- grade children's paired-associate learning. Two basic lists, one high similarity and one low similarity, made up from Greek letters arranged in three-letter combinations were prepared. Stimulus words were presented orally while children viewed the Greek letter word in black or in one of six colors. Ninety-six of the 144 subjects were assigned to one of eight groups represented by combinations of high and low intralist similarity, scrambled or serial presentation, and colored or non-colored stimuli. The remaining children were assigned to four groups and exposed to selected pre-criterion learning condi- tions but their data were not considered in the acquisition trials analyses. Subjects learned words to two correct consecutive anticipa-</page><page sequence="65">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al 195 tions of the list of six words or were given 15 trials. A post-criterion trial followed immediately. Analysis of variance showed that serial order of presentation aided learning but color did not. Comparisons of pre- and post-performance indicated poorer performance resulted from removal of cues, even when color was the only cue removed. The author stated that color seemed to be a less potent cue than others, but that it was still better than no cue. Frase (129) varied question location, question pacing, ques- tion mode, and content location in studying their effect upon the retention of question-relevant and incidental prose material. Ques- tions were placed before and after paragraphs (location), were of multiple choice or constructed response variety (mode), were paced after every 10, 20, 40, or 50 sentences, and were located in the first or second part of each ten-sentence paragraph in a 2000-word pass- age. A forty-item criterion retention test consisting of both relevant and incidental questions was given after reading the passage. Ques- tions placed after the prose passage facilitated retention more than did questions placed before the passage. Relevant information was retained significantly better (.001) than was incidental information. Post-treatment questions were answered better with frequent pacing of questions throughout. Conversely, when questions preceded the passage, less frequent pacing of questions throughout was most effective. No significant differences were noted for question mode. Regardless of pacing or location of questions, higher incidental retention was achieved if the incidental material followed the rele- vant material. In another study, Frase (128) studied the effect of passage organization on memory. His subjects were presented with one of four treatments of science-type materials dealing with a solar system of ten planets: 1] a sentence form in which the material was organ- ized by names (concepts) of the planets (SN); 2] a sentence form in which the material was organized by attributes of the planets (A); 3] the same material as in SN but presented in paragraph form (PN); 4] the same material found in SA presented in paragraph form (PA). All sentences were eight words in length with only the planets' names and attributes varying. Subjects were tested individually and asked to find the name of the planet given three attributes of that planet. Time for locating the information was recorded. The subject was then tested for recall of the planets' names and their attributes and was given a recognition test on the planets' names. A measure of interest in the task was also obtained. A 2 x 2 factorial design</page><page sequence="66">196 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 with organization and format as the factors was the statistical pro- cedure employed. Groups SN and PN had significantly lower mean scores than did the SA and PA groups on recognition, but scored higher on recall. No time or attitude differences were found. Mills (278) explored the effects of familiarity of passages on rate of learning and amount of recall. Using 19 passages, and 50 male judges of familiarity, 8 were selected, ranging from familiar to unfamiliar at fairly equidistant intervals. Later, eight students learned each passage to an errorless trial and one week later, re- learned to the same criterion. Because of a curvilinear trend in results, a trend analysis was made. The F values for the quadratic trend revealed significant differences in the passage used, and the differences were systematically related to the values on the familiarity scale. In recall, no systematic differences appeared, but those found related to familiarity. Samuels and Wittrock (342) studied the strength of asso- ciation between two words when learning to read the second word in a two-word chain. Strength of association between stimulus word and response word was varied in four treatments by varying the number of times the subject said the two words as a pair. In one treatment, the response word was said alone but the two were never pronounced as a pair. Subjects were first pre-tested on all words, then given word association training on six pairs of words, reading training on eight pairs of words, and a final word recognition test on eight response words. Subjects were required to know all stimulus words and no response words in order to participate in the study. An analysis of variance treatment was computed for the number of correct responses on the final test. Word effect was significant, in- dicating that subjects learned certain words more easily than others. Significantly more correct reading responses were given for all of the word-association training treatments than for the no-word asso- ciation training. The authors felt their findings gave support to the practice of introducing new words in context. Samuels (341) required his subjects to recognize tachisto- scopically presented words and word pairs under five conditions: facilitating, neutral, interfering, and two control conditions. In the facilitation treatment, after reading the first word of a pair, the anticipated next word was flashed. In the interference and neutral treatments, a word other than the anticipated one was flashed follow- ing the first word. One control treatment gave subjects word associates not previously presented; the second provided subjects with just</page><page sequence="67">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 197 the target words that had been introduced previously. An analysis of variance for a 5 x 5 repeated-measures Latin square design was em- ployed in analyzing the data. Only the treatment effect of word association on speed of recognition was found significant (.001). Word-recognition speed was facilitated when associative connections between words in the text matched the word associations of the reader, and recognition speed was retarded when the response or target word was preceded by a nonassociated word. Other findings suggested that word associations and knowledge of the domain from which target words were drawn were factors influencing recognition speed. Ausubel, Stager, and Gaite (20) ascertained whether retro- active interference occurred in a situation involving substantive re- tention of meaningful material. In addition, the effect of overlearn- ing on retroactive interference was studied. The 156 grade twelve subjects were given two passages to read, both dealing with basic concepts of two religions. A third passage focusing on an unrelated topic was given to a control group in lieu of the second passage. A 31-item multiple-choice test covering the first passage was used to assess learning performance of all subjects. In the first session, all subjects received a first passage on Zen Buddhism followed by either the second or the unrelated passage. Subjects were then assigned to one of four groups for two sessions to receive various treatments including overlearning. In a fourth session, all students were tested on the multiple-choice test. Retroactive interference was not found when the connected and meaningful passage was inter- polated between the Zen Buddhism passage and the test covering it. Rather, both overlearning and interpolation facilitated retention of the original material. Williams (401) designed a series of three experiments com- paring the effectiveness of two methods of teaching multiple corres- pondences of grapheme-phoneme relationships: 1] successive, in which only one phoneme associated with a grapheme was presented at one time; and 2] concurrent, in which two phonemes associated with a grapheme were introduced and practiced at the same time. In addition, two single or one-to-one grapheme-phoneme correspond- ences were taught to pupils. A paired-associate paradigm was used in teaching relationships in all three experiments. Concurrent instruc- tion appeared better able to develop the ability to try more than one phoneme for a grapheme. In terms of a test criterion, concurrent presentation appeared to be more effective than successive, but the</page><page sequence="68">198 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 results were not clear. In a small validation study with first-grade pupils, the author reported findings similar to those of the main study. IV-6 Visual perception and reading Leider (233) used three of the Goins tests of visual percep- tion with pupils in fourth grade and obtained cofficients of correla- tion with scores on two forms of the Huelsman Word Discrimination Test, the Kuhlman Anderson Intelligence Test, and the Chicago Reading Test. The combined Reversals and Pattern Copying Tests of the Goins tests correlated with the Huelsman Word Discrimination Test at .677 and with the total comprehension score of the Chicago Reading Test at .699. Leider suggested a possible strength of closure factor in conceptual as well as in perceptual aspects of reading. Dunn-Rankin (104) used a relative rather than an absolute discrimination task to scale the discriminability of 21 lower-case letters (omitted were j, q, v, x, and z) most commonly used in a set of pre-primary and primary reading texts. A target letter was followed by five letter pairs to force a choice of the one which most resembled the target. Targets and choices were changed systematically until each letter was used as a target for 210 pairs. The frequency preference matrix was scaled by two techniques and appropriate coefficients were submitted to factor analyses. The results showed considerable agreement among the pupils who rated the letters. A figure was presented portraying the degree of similarity of each of the twenty letters to each target letter. The factor analysis revealed that letters were clustered in definable groups based on size, formal similarity, axial rotation, and line-to-curve transformations. Kolers and Perkins (224) explored perception by requiring adults to name geometrically-transformed letters and strings of let- ters the length of words. The letters had been rotated, reflected, or inverted, and direction of scanning was both right and left. Speed of naming 800 letters under various combinations of conditions was recorded. Analysis of variance revealed that identical letters required significantly different amounts of time to be named, depending on the direction of naming, and that this direction interacted with the nature of letter transformation. Naming letters was more rapid when the letters faced in the same direction as the scanning occurred. In a second report, Kolers and Perkins (223) analyzed the errors made in the foregoing investigation. A total of 66,560 letters appeared singly and 93,600 appeared in pseudowords. Only 23 errors were made in normal orientation. However, error rates were 3.8 and</page><page sequence="69">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 199 4.2 per cent respectively for individual letters and pseudowords. Further analysis revealed that eleven letters comprised 42 per cent of the total but accounted for 91 per cent of the errors of naming. A graphical confusion matrix supported the conclusion that errors were due to confusions in visual processing rather than phonetic or memorial confusion. Inversion induced the greatest number of errors, followed by mirror reflection, rotation in plane, and normal. This order of frequency was identical with the order of speed of naming. Smith (362) investigated the relative ease of identifying letters in isolation and in trigrams. Ten college students were sub- jects in the first experiment in which five lists were used: high redundancy words, low redundancy words, high redundancy tri- grams, low redundancy trigrams, and a scrambled list of improbable and unpronounceable trigrams. Ten levels of lighting were used to permit re-exposure until there was recognition of each part and/or the whole. Serial-position and response-order scores were recorded. The results revealed no superiority in the identification of all three letters in words versus non-words, and it was concluded that words were recognized as sequences rather than as wholes. Twenty-eight college students were subjects in the second experiment in which four new ten-triplet lists were constructed with more rigid control. An examination of errors revealed that an average of 3.7 confusion types accounted for 67 per cent of errors in the first study and 3.5 confusion types accounted for 74 per cent in the second. This find- ing was interpreted to mean that incorrect letter reports were based on discrimination of features common to small sets of letters. Finally, both experiments supported the notion of sequential depend- encies as the basis for recognizing letters in words more readily than in isolation. Wheelock (398) investigated the effect of training in recog- nition and discrimination of capital letters on visual discrimination. Visual discrimination sub-tests one, two, and four of the Lee-Clark Reading Readiness Test were administered before and after instruc- tion, as was the Letter-Form-Training Criterion Test constructed by the investigator. Instruction was given 15 minutes each school day for one month using strip film exposures of the letters to an experi- mental group. The control group, also composed of 45 children, from extremes of socio-economic levels, received no training. Analy- sis of covariance revealed that the experimental group made signifi- cant (.01) gains on the Lee-Clark tests, compared to controls, and</page><page sequence="70">200 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY ? Winter 1970 V/2 that the greatest gains were made by the lower socio-economic group. Significant gains were also made in the Letter-Form test. Petersen and Magaro (304) explored relationships between field dependence and reading achievement in a pilot study. They used the WISC with half the subjects in the study and the Otis- Quick Scoring Mental Abilities Tests with the other half. The reading section of the Wide Range Achievement Test and a modified form of the Embedded Figure Test (EFT) were given to all students, half of whom had learning problems. Coefficients of correlation among the tests were: reading with I.Q., .83; reading with EFT, -.60; I.Q. with EFT, -.54. Partial correlation, controlling I.Q., be- tween EFT and reading was insignificant (.32). The twenty students were divided, by time required on the EFT test, into field dependent and independent groups. Training in identifying embedded figures was given to both groups. Comparing the number of trials to secure a correct response of the two groups with intelligence as a covariate did not yield significant differences. Whipple and Kodman (399) examined the visual discrimina- tion and perceptual learning of retarded readers compared to normals. The two groups had I.Q.'s on the WISC ranging from 90 to 115 and were matched on other variables except that mean reading grade for the retarded group was 3.12 and for the normal group, it was 4.40. The first experiment required either simultaneous or successive presentations; half of each group was assigned to each treatment. Two cue cards, two identical paper cups, and a toy cat were exposed so that each subject had to associate the cue card with the paper cup under which the cat was hidden. The simultaneous discrimina- tion learning used both positive and negative cue cards while the successive used one then another. Analysis of covariance revealed significant group and method differences as well as an interaction. The retarded readers learned more slowly in all situations but even more slowly in the complex task. The second task, perceptual learn- ing, used a series of nonsense scribbles to be differentiated from a standard stimulus. The normal readers had significantly (.001) fewer errors on the first trial, fewer errors in total, and learned to discriminate in fewer trials than did retarded readers. Petersen (305) set up twenty slides of digits and letters ver- tically, horizontally, and obliquely and presented them tachisto- scopically for one half second to determine pattern of eye movements. Subsequently, the relationships to reading, measured by the New York State Elementary Schools Reading Test, were analyzed. The</page><page sequence="71">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 201 basic patterns were: horizontal, left to right; horizontal, left to right and drop to a lower line; up obliquely, left to right; down obliquely, left to right; down obliquely, right to left; and irregular, with shifting patterns. The largest proportion of subjects from each school fell into the last category. Scores on comprehension and word meaning tests did not distinguish the groups, and some reversals of trends were found for the two schools. Solan (367) exposed three digits tachistoscopically to first graders at speeds of .1 seconds and .01 seconds to determine means and percentile norms. Mean scores of 21 at .1 seconds and 19.4 at .01 seconds were found. Coefficients of correlation between number of correct digits and reading scores on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests were .500 at .1 exposure and .434 at .01 exposure. Hurley (188) examined the proposition that measures of visual-tactual-kinesthetic integration would distinguish between ade- quate and inadequate readers. He used subjects from two towns, matching pairs except for reading which differed markedly. He used three tests of short term visual memory, three of spatial ability, and four of intersensory integration with the eighty subjects. Factor analysis of the intercorrelation matrix yielded five factors with read- ing separate from the others. The derived factor scores were submit- ted to a three way analysis of variance (sex x town x reading). Dif- ferences in the towns appeared frequently but the main effect of reading on intersensory integration was not significant. IV-7 Auditory perception The two research reports in this section deal with cognitive aspects of word discrimination and the effects of reading methods on auditory memory. Blank (36) carried on three experiments to identify factors involved in performance on the Wepman Auditory Discrimination Test. The first experiment focused on the structure of the language, especi- ally the degree of inflection. Israeli first-graders were the subjects. Comparison of the 23 retarded with the 23 normal readers on audi- tory discrimination tests in the English and Hebrew languages re- vealed that poor readers scored consistently lower and that they found word endings more difficult to discriminate than beginnings in both languages. In the second experiment, using 12 children in each group, the concept of same-different was eliminated by asking the subjects to repeat the pairs of Hebrew words. The first score was. the number of individual words repeated. The second was the num-</page><page sequence="72">202 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 ber of same words so repeated and the number of different words repeated as different regardless of the errors on individual words. Again the normals significantly exceeded the retarded readers. Analy- sis of the types of errors revealed perseveration on the part of retarded readers, suggesting a set for two identical words. In the third experi- ment another 12 children in each group were asked to repeat all of the words of the previous experiment but only one word was given at a time. Pairs were separated to avoid perseveration. Differences between normal and retarded readers were not significant. The author concluded that auditory discrimination of retarded readers was affected by stimulus demands of the test situation. Neville (289) used three approaches to teaching the reading of beginning materials to determine the relative effects on auditory memory span. Subjects were of upper and lower learning aptitude levels based on composite scores from the: Pintner Cunningham Primary General Ability Test, Verbal series; Harrison Stroud Reading Readiness Profiles, Auditory sub-tests four and five; and Murphy- Durrell Reading Readiness Analysis, Learning Rate sub-test. After the words had been taught in isolation, the three treatments began. The oral group read the story aloud twice, then silently. The echoic group heard the teacher read the story, then they read aloud, then silently. The silent group read the story twice silently then listened as one child read orally. This procedure was followed two periods daily for ten consecutive days per preprimer. After each preprimer a non- standardized silent reading test was given. Pre- and post-tests were the Auditory Attention Span for Related Syllables from the Detroit Tests of Learning Aptitude. Analysis of treatments by learning levels revealed the main effect for memory span for learning levels was significant (.001). At the lower levels, both silent and echoic groups significantly (.01) surpassed the oral group. On fluency of oral reading the echoic group was superior to the oral and silent groups, mainly at the upper level. No sex differences were found. Coefficients of correlation were insignificant except for a negative relation (-.463) between memory span and word recognition errors for the silent group. IV-8 Reading and language abilities Studies investigating various grapheme-phoneme principles, new measures of grammatical complexity, and various aspects of the comprehension difficulty of materials are included among the re- ports in this section.</page><page sequence="73">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 203 A three-phase study noting relationships of mental ability, reading ability, and listening ability among army inductees was reported by Sticht (376). Because only the first phase involved read- ing, the other parts are not reported here. In the first phase of the study, 96 inductees were administered both a reading and a listen- ing comprehension test. Two tests, Test A and Test B, were prepared in each format and had four sub-tests with grade level difficulties of 6.5, 7.5, or 14.5 as measured by a modification of the Flesch formula. Inductees were divided into a low mental aptitude (LMA) group and an average mental aptitude (AMA) group on the basis of scores obtained on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. LMA and AMA groups were further subdivided into two sub-groups each. One sub-group from each of the major groups received Test A as a listen- ing test and B as a reading test while the other sub-groups were given the tests in reverse format. Tests assessed factual information only and required subjects to fill in blanks. None of the differences between listening and reading within groups were statistically signi- ficant. The other phases of the study dealt with intelligibility of instruction by time-compressed speech. Burmeister (60) classified the sounds of all vowel-vowel combinations forming a single phoneme found in a list of 17,310 words to determine the common sounds of each vowel pair. Vowel pairs occurring fewer than fifty times were not considered. Vowel pairs included were looked at for frequency of occurrence of each phoneme for each grapheme and for single phoneme percentages for each grapheme. Tables were presented giving both frequency and per cent of various pronunciations of 26 vowel pairs. Findings in- cluded the following: 1] the first vowel may dominate; 2] the two vowels may blend; 3] the two vowels may create a new sound; or 4] the vowel pairs may separate. Bormuth (48) investigated whether frequency, mean word depth, and length of independent clauses correlated with the compre- hension difficulties of independent clauses. In addition, the research studied the effect of level of reading achievement on the size of any relationships obtained. Five forms of a cloze test were constructed on each of twenty 300-word passages representing five different con- tent areas. Each form of the cloze test was given to one of five sub-groups consisting of 139 subjects, matched for means and dis- tribution of scores on the Reading sub-test of the Stanford Achieve- ment Test. Difficulty levels for each word, independent clause, and passage were determined and were correlated with the measures of</page><page sequence="74">204 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 grammatical complexity. Difficulties of the independent clauses were calculated for the subjects who were divided into five groups on the basis of reading scores. Clauses were divided into thirds on the basis of their value on each grammatical complexity variable. An analysis of variance was performed to determine if the interaction between reading achievement and levels of grammatical complexity was significant. All of the grammatical complexity variables with the possible exception of frequency of individual clauses had a significant correlation with comprehension difficulty at the clause level of analysis. At the passage level, only mean word depth and individual clause length appeared significant. The size of coefficients of correlation between measures of mean word depth and length of an independent clause did not appear dependent upon reading ability. An extensive report by Carterette and Jones (68) compared the redundancy of children's spontaneous language at various ages with that of junior college students and also with that of their readers and free choice books. Redundancy of letters and phonemes in two graded series of readers, in children's free choice books at the corresponding levels, and in spontaneous speech patterns of subjects freely interacting in trios was determined by computer. In addition, mean word length and sentence length were obtained. Distribution of single letters was found to be about the same for all levels of text with redundancy of texts decreasing and mean word length increasing with higher grade levels. Free choice books were less redundant than basal readers. Mean sentence length was shorter in readers than in leisure type materials. For spontaneous speech, children appeared to have the same phoneme inventory as did young adults with almost the same frequency distributions. The reader is referred to the original source for a detailed description of findings and procedures. Koen, Becker, and Young (221) carried out a series of three experiments in order 1] to assess the amount of agreement among subjects in identifying paragraph boundaries, 2] to determine what proportion of cues to paragraph structure are formal, 3] to note whether different cues are used to identify paragraph forms in vari- ous prose types, and 4] to study developmental changes in the ability to identify paragraph structures. In 10 of 11 prose passages with paragraph indentions removed, nonsense words of equal length were used to replace all nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. Passages represented seven prose types. Subjects responded to randomly as- signed paragraphs in nonsense (N) and English (E) forms by placing</page><page sequence="75">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 205 paragraph markers where they felt they belonged. No subject re- ceived the same paragraph in two forms. Subjects in experiments one and two were college undergraduates. For experiment three, 12 subjects aged 7 to 8 years old, 10 subjects aged 10 to 12 years, and 13 aged 14 to 16 years old were used. In experiments one and two, there was 80 per cent or better paragraphing agreement for 17 of the 19 sentence junctures. In every case but one, interjudge agree- ment was greater for E than for N versions of the same passage. A median Pearson product-moment coefficient of correlation of .71 was found between E and N versions of the same passage. Findings indicated that the dominant cues used in paragraphing were formal in nature. However, both semantic and formal markers contributed to the perception of paragraph structures. For experiment three, a regular increase in interjudge consistency in ability to identify para- graph structures was found with increasing age and schooling. The youngest children placed a number of their paragraph markers within sentences, thereby giving an indication that the concept of paragraph was not meaningful. Two short experiments were presented by Herriot (175) in one report. In the first experiment, two types of sentence frames using five nonsense words in each were employed. The first sentence frame used a subject with qualifying phrase and predicate (PE). The second consisted of a subject and predicate with qualifying phrase (PS). Subjects were randomly assigned to a group reading either three PE or three PS type sentences. After reading the sen- tences, they were required, under time constraints, to substitute for all nonsense forms words having the same function. The PS group inserted significantly more correct forms and made significantly fewer errors than did the PE group. Results supported Yngve's depth theory and indicated that sentences of greater depth were more difficult than those of lesser depth. The second experiment manipu- lated sentence order in either an object-subject (OS) or subject- object (SO) order. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two groups and followed procedures similar to those in the first ex- periment. Mean differences favored the SO group for the number of grammatically correct words substituted. The author interpreted his results as supporting the hypothesis that the subject is expected to occur first in a sentence. In a second report, Herriot (174) presented findings of two experiments requiring subjects to identify the logical subjects (LS) and the logical object (LO) in active (A) and passive (P) reversible</page><page sequence="76">206 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY ? Winter 1970 V/2 sentences. In the first experiment, A and P sentences were presented in both reversed and non-reversed order so that four types of sen- tences were formed: active expected (AE), active counter to expec- tation (AC), passive expected (PE), and passive counter to expecta- tion (PC). Experiment two was similar except that reversal (R) did not result in any change in expectations. The four types of sentences then were AN, AR, PN, and PR (N=non-reversed). Subjects re- ceived one sentence of each type and were to state as quickly as pos- sible LS and LO of sentences spoken by the examiner. All subjects were graduates or qualified teachers in a British university. Response latencies and error scores were calculated for each subject. Results of the first experiment indicated that expectations were a significant variable in comprehension of A and P sentences. In the second experiment, a significant voice but no reversal effect was found. The author suggested that the nature of the sentence should determine which features are attended to in reading for comprehension. Using a cloze procedure, Tannenbaum, Williams, and Clark (384) studied whether providing subjects with the grammatical form class designation of a deleted word would affect their perform- ance in a word prediction task. Subjects were randomly assigned to a condition in which they replaced words under either a form class designation procedure or a regular doze procedure. Verbatim re- placement scores and form class scores were calculated for subjects. Form class scores were further subdivided into function and semantic items. The addition of form class information produced a significant overall effect in verbatim performance for function words but not for semantic items. Thomas (386) investigated consonant-vowel order in the recognition of three-letter words and pseudowords that varied in four levels of rated pronounceability. Thirty subjects were selected from the average classrooms of a homogeneously grouped school at each of grades one, two, and three. Eight words and 24 trigrams, divided into three sets of eight pseudowords each, were rated for pronounce- ability by fifty college students. The 32 stimuli were then flashed to each subject in random order and he was asked to spell what he saw. Data were analyzed by means of a within-and between-subjects analysis of variance with grade and sex as between-variables and treatments as the within-variable. Differences among grades, sex, and all interactions were non-significant. Only treatments reached signi- ficance (.001). Words were more accurately recognized than were CVC trigrams but no differences appeared between the recognition of</page><page sequence="77">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 207 the two levels of CCV trigrams. The author concluded that accuracy of recognition was not a simple function of the pronounceability of the element. Adults representing three widely-divergent levels of reading skill and experience were used as subjects in Otto and Koenke's (300) study. Subjects were to respond to pictorial stimuli presented as a word-association task to determine whether there were differences in responses. A random selection of subjects was made from an adult basic education class, an adult vocational typing class, and a uni- versity class. Each subject was asked to write the first associations other than a simple name that came to him for each of 25 black-and- white line drawings portraying common objects. Responses were scored on two bases: consensuality among good readers and consen- suality among the subject's own group. Mean consensuality scores were then compared. A decrease in consensuality from the university to the vocation to the adult basic group was noted. IV-9 Factors in interpretation F. B. Davis (92) constructed two forms of a test of reading comprehension and carried out elaborate statistical analysis to de- termine the components of reading comprehension among high-school seniors. From a pool of about 3000 test items, the author selected 320, each based on a separate passage and equally distributed among eight reading skills hypothesized to be unique. The items were in- cluded in two experimental test forms which were administered to 400 students. The Kuder-Richardson estimate of reliability of each form was .96. Differential item analysis was made by relating each item on one form to the scores on the second form. Along with the difficulty indices, it was possible to provide two relatively equivalent new tests to measure each of the eight skills. The revised forms were administered to 988 different students. Reliability coefficients of total forms were high and for the eight sub-totals, of such magnitude, that uniqueness analyses could be performed. The data revealed that 32 per cent of the non-error variance of skill one (memory for word meanings) was not involved in any of the other seven. Likewise about twenty per cent of the non-error variance of skill five (drawing inferences from the content) was not involved in the others. Three other skills showing considerable unique variance were: following the structure of a passage; recognizing a writer's purpose, attitude, tone, and mood; and finding answers to questions asked explicitly or in paraphrase. The major conclusion reached by Davis was that</page><page sequence="78">208 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY ? Winter 1970 V/2 among mature readers, comprehension is not a unitary mental skill or operation. Benz and Rosemier (32) explored the relationship between word analysis and comprehension at fourth grade. Pupils in 55 classrooms were given the Gates Level of Comprehension Test, and the Bond, Clymer, and Hoyt Silent Reading Diagnostic Tests. Un- specified intelligence test data were available showing a mean I.Q. of 107. Six word analysis skills significantly (.01) distinguished high, middle, and low groups as they were separated by the compre- hension test. Partial coefficients of correlation between each of the six word skills and comprehension were calculated over levels with the other five controlled. Results revealed that words in context, rhyming sounds, and syllabication ranked highest, having coefficients of about .55, .48, and .43, respectively. The beta weights on multiple regression equations confirmed the previous finding. The R2 re- vealed that about 54 per cent of the variance in comprehension could be accounted for by the word analysis skills. When intelligence was added, the seven variables could account for 57 per cent of the variance. Bormuth (47) investigated the cloze procedure as a measure of reading comprehension. He used nine passages of about 250 words each, from which he deleted every fifth word. On the same passages, he constructed seven multiple-choice tests with measures of vocabulary, explicitly stated facts, sequences of events, stated caused relationships, main ideas, inferences, and the author's pur- pose. He found that most of the tests were highly reliable. A correla- tion matrix, constructed from the 16 scores, was analyzed using the principal components model and using an orthogonal, normal vari- max rotation. The analysis yielded only one vector, which accounted for 77 per cent of the variance in the matrix, and on which the factor loadings were maximal. He concluded that the two types of tests measured the same skills. Bloomer (42) also compared cloze scores with comprehen- sion test scores on the same selections. His subjects came from alter- nate grades ranging from fifth to eleventh. The materials were com- prised of 24 passages, each of 600 words, adjusted by the Yoakum formula to fifth-grade difficulty. Deletions were 10 per cent and in- cluded six types: random, nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns and conjunctions, and noun determiners. Each subject read six selections with identical types of deletions, but selections were randomly assigned to each class. Twelve comprehension questions were asked</page><page sequence="79">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 209 on each selection. All scores at grade seven were significantly (.01) higher than at grade five except for noun deletions. Grade nine scores were significantly higher than grade seven except that of noun deletions. Grade eleven was essentially equivalent to grade nine except for the noun determiner group. The author used these findings to support his conclusion that materials of appropriate levels of difficulty are self-reinforcing, while those either too easy or diffi- cult are not. A second analysis revealed that at all grades noun, adjec- tive, and verb deletions were inferior to no deletions and random dele- tions. A third problem dealt with recall ten weeks after reading the selections. Half of the comprehension questions, randomly selected, were used. Recall on noun determiners, prepositions and conjunctions, and nouns was found to be superior to random deletion. From these findings Bloomer raised the question as to the relationship between comprehension, as measured, and learning. He correlated the number of correct closures with immediate and recall comprehension scores and found an average by Z transformation of .20. Likewise, little rela- tion was found with recall. The author used these findings to conclude that the cloze procedure and comprehension questions do not measure the same abilities. Several sex differences were found and interpreted in the framework of self-reinforcement. J. E. Davis (93) studied a single facet of critical reading: middle grade pupils' behavior on a test of fact and opinion. The test included ten paragraphs selected from readers, social studies, and science texts at three grade levels. Only 36 per cent of the group secured scores of 70 per cent correct or higher. The pupils were signi- ficantly superior (.01) in identifying statements of fact compared to opinion. Pupils in grades five and six did not differ significantly on the test but both were superior to pupils in grade four. No significant sex differences were found within a grade although girls' mean scores were higher than boys' scores. Scores on the fact and opinion test correlated significantly (.43 and .55) with reading achievement (test unnamed). Pupils in each grade who read above grade level were more capable on the experimental test than were those at or below grade level. Likewise pupils with I.Q.'s of 100 and above were significantly superior to those of I.Q. 99 and below. Three investigations dealt with different aspects of reading- study. Legge (232) correlated the scores on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills with total scores on the Stanford Achievement Test, and with the Lorge-Thorndike I.Q.'s. Coefficients were .864 and .694, respec- tively. Partial correlation, removing I.Q., was about .80. Instruction</page><page sequence="80">210 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 given by a librarian and homeroom teachers during the year yielded almost equal gains in above- and below-median I.Q. groups. Frase (130) carried on two experiments to determine the effects of three types of questions posed before reading a paragraph. In the first experiment, college students underlined the words which comprised a complete sentence answering one of six questions. The same paragraph was used but subjects answered only specific, com- parative, or general questions. The data revealed that more words were underlined from specific to general. However, about 27 per cent of students underlined only words in the general section. In the second experiment subjects read the guide question and paragraph and then answered multiple-choice questions on nine items. Comparison by guide question revealed that those who were asked the specific question gave more correct answers to the specific (82 per cent) than to the comparative (61 per cent) or the general (39 per cent). Those who had the general guide questions scored lower on all types of responses. Thus the orienting task (question) had a critical influence on information gained. In the third study, Crewe (89) altered the duration and the spacing of study sessions to determine the effects on retention of a 13-page chapter. The amount of reading-study time was held constant for all groups except the control. At the first reading, an underlining technique was employed. Groups had the following treatments: no review, one review (15 minutes the day before the test and five weeks after initial reading), two reviews (15 minutes each after two weeks and the day before the test), cramming group that read and reviewed the day before the test, and the control that took the test without studying the materials. The first reading was accompanied by underlining. The control group averaged little better than a chance score on the multiple-choice test. Cramming was the most effective treatment, then two-review, one-review, and no-review treatments. The conclusion was reached that retention was facilitated by re- view, even in short periods and by the placement of study time close to the time of examination. J. C. Johnson (202) reported the relationship between com- prehension of stories and attitudes toward their themes. Three themes chosen were labeled: anthropomorphic, victorious underdog, and culturally-alien. Three stories dealing with each theme, at each grade level (four, five, and six) permitted each child to read nine selections. On each selection he answered twenty constructed com- prehension questions. An attitude inventory related to the three</page><page sequence="81">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 211 themes was constructed. The investigator reported that sex, C.A., school, grade level, socio-economic level, and intelligence level had significant effects, although no data were presented. The conclu- sion (without data) was stated that significant differences in literal comprehension of a culturally-alien theme could be attributed to a corresponding attitude and that differences in interpretive responses could be attributed to differences in underdog attitude. IV-10 Oral reading Clay (80) analyzed 10,525 oral reading errors made by 100 children examined weekly during their first year in school. In this report she analyzed all substitution errors to determine their struc- tural equivalence to the textual materials. In addition, single-word errors were analyzed to locate points of phoneme-grapheme corres- pondences. Of the 7674 substitution errors, 72 per cent were found in equivalent morpheme-class or morpheme-sequence class structures. When errors were single words, she found that the correct and sub- tituted words belonged to an equivalent morpheme class in 79 per cent of the comparisons. Self-correction rates were low for noun and article classes compared to pronoun classes. Phoneme-grapheme an- alysis of 2388 errors (excluding nouns) revealed that in 41 per cent of the substitutions children might be responding to visual character- istics of letters. Clay interpreted these findings to support the con- clusion that error behavior was guided by the syntactic framework of the sentences rather than phoneme-grapheme correspondence in words. In a second analysis of the same data, Clay (79) analyzed error correction. In the preliminary stages, she found that children progressed from page matching to line matching to locating some words to reading the spaces (coordinating spoken with printed words). After book reading began, she found that the four groups (H-high progress, HM-high middle, LM-low middle, and L-low) dif- fered significantly, each group being significantly different from the next (.01). The median H group made one error in about 37 words while the L group made one error in about two and a half words. Likewise error correction differed: H, 1 in 3 or 4; HM, 1 in 3 or 4; LM, 1 in 8; L, 1 in 20. She interpreted the errors and error correction in terms of cognitive dissonance. Nurss (292) used sentences of high, mid, and low structural depth, according to Allen's sector analysis depth figure, and analyzed the number and type of oral reading errors accordingly. One group of</page><page sequence="82">212 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 subjects had been screened so that only those who recognized 90 per cent of the two Dolch Lists (Basic and Nouns) were included. The second group of 36 were unselected. Analysis of variance re- vealed significant effects (.05) due to level of syntactic complexity for hesitations, self-corrections, and total oral errors. In each case, high structural depth produced more errors. When repetitions were divided into whole or part of a structural unit, the former seemed to be characteristic of low structural depth and the latter, of the high structural sentences. Mann (254) recorded and analyzed oral reading errors among pupils who had simultaneously learned Hebrew and English. She was interested in the reversal errors that might be attributed to the dual directionality. Pupils read easy, average, and difficult passages from Spache's Diagnostic Reading Scales. She found that the ratio of reversal errors to all other errors was quite small and that the greatest number appeared among the poorest readers. Fewer appeared at third grade than at second grade. Poulton and Brown (314) compared scores on ten compre- hensions per 450-word passage after subjects had read them silently and orally. Time was equated for oral and silent reading, based on the time required to read orally during practice sessions. Eight sub- jects were asked to read in each of three ways: with expression, as quickly as possible, or so quickly that expression and meaning were neglected. Mean seconds for oral reading respectively were: 163, 119, and 110. Corresponding mean seconds allowed for silent reading were 166, 118, and 111. No significant differences were found in overall comprehension for passages read orally and silently. Each compre- hension question covered approximately one tenth of the passage so it was possible to compare efficiency in various parts since all 24 subjects read both. Comprehension for oral reading was 51 per cent and for silent, 71 per cent. In contrast, comprehension of the last question was 81 per cent for oral and 56 per cent for silent reading. These findings were interpreted to mean that oral reading interfered with recall at first but improved it after practice. Geyer (139) proposed a theoretical model of perception in reading which he tested with records of eye-voice span using eight sub- jects, not described. Each subject read orally three passages, described only as varying in difficulty. Eye-movement records were made on 35 mm. film while voice was recorded on a tape recorder, both of which were synchronized. Both records were transferred to elapsed time graphs so that the simultaneous action of eye and voice could</page><page sequence="83">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 213 be calculated each thirtieth of a second for the passage. Measures of temporal eye-voice span provided the data to test Geyer's hypotheses. Smoothness of fixation was determined by the per cent of single, forward fixations to the total number of fixations. A coefficient of constancy was calculated for the eye-voice span. Between subjects, coefficients of correlation of the latter two measures were .83, .98, and .90 for individual passages and .95 for combined passages. Com- bining all subjects and passages, 24 pairs of comparisons of smooth- ness of fixation and constancy of eye-voice span correlated .93. Thus the hypothesis that during smooth oral reading the temporal eye- voice span would remain relatively constant was supported. Like- wise, the second hypothesis that the period of time separating eye and voice in smooth reading would be about one second was sup- ported. Examination of the records revealed that interruption of smooth reading created corrective behavior of the eyes to reestablish the temporal balance. D. J. King (213) explored variables which he anticipated as predictors of the amount of retention under delayed auditory feedback (DAF). Three measures were used: oral reading rate on each of three paragraphs of a story of 166 words; accuracy of recall of each para- graph of which the second had DAF; voice level for the three paragraphs. As expected, the mean reading rate for the DAF paragraph was significantly slower than the others. In accuracy of recall there were significant effects for paragraphs and sex. The differences be- tween sexes accounted for the change in voice amplitude. Coefficients of correlation were calculated; reading time was a good predictor of retention (.946) for females but not for males. For the latter the change in sound level was the best predictor of recall under DAF. The College Entrance Examination Board verbal score was unrelated to recall in either sex. Gilbert (141) studied oral reading rate of 12 female sub- jects, recording words per minute and a phonation time ratio. Subjects read the same selection daily for five successive days. The total mean reading yielded a mean rate of 193 words per minute. This rate was faster than those reported in 1939 (166 wpm) and 1943 (183 wpm). IV-11 Other factors relating to reading Warner (389) investigated the relationship of nine variables to reading achievement at grades three and four. The subjects were of Caucasian, Mexican-American, Negro, and Oriental ethnic groups</page><page sequence="84">214 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 with median I.Q.'s of 130.6. Through a structured interview lingual deviation was observed in grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation. Visual perception required identification and reproduction of alpha- betic sequences and those with one letter out of order in three, six, and nine letter combinations. Emotional reaction was determined on a nine-point scale dealing with degree of participation as a sub- ject. Socio-economic status was based on parental occupation and residence. Reading achievement was determined by scores on the California Achievement Test. No significant difference in reading achievement was found among ethnic groups when intelligence was held constant. Likewise, no significant differences among ethnic groups were found in socio-economic level, sex, age, and emotional reaction to the interview. Significant differences were found in lingual deviation, especially in pronunciation of vowels and in visual per- ception. Benger (31) investigated the interrelationships of visual and auditory perception, intelligence, and personality traits to reading achievement at the end of first grade. Reading tests were the Edmon- ton Public School Word Recognition Test and the Gates Primary Paragraph Reading Test. Two stratified samples, of thirty each matched by sex, were selected from above- and below-average pupils based on these tests. Eliminated were pupils outside the average range of intelligence, below-average in arithmetic, those with emo- tional disturbance, or gross physical defects. Visual and auditory screening was done. Subjects came from lower to upper middle socio-economic levels. Visual perception was measured by five sub- tests of the Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception. The Wepman Auditory Discrimination Test was used. Aural vocabulary was obtained from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Intelligence was determined by the Stanford Binet Test. Personality was rated on a five-point scale by teachers in: Concentration, Dominance, Sub- mission, and Persistence. The resulting data were treated using multiple linear regression and F ratios or t tests. Differences at the .05 level were found between good and poor readers on the Frostig sub-tests II and V, although they did not correlate highly with reading. The personality rating for concentration correlated highest (-.696) with reading. The best combination, excluding intelligence, was concentration, visual and auditory perception. The three, how- ever, accounted for only 36 per cent of the variance. Chittenden, Foan, Zweil, and Smith (75) compared school achievement records of first- and second-born siblings when they</page><page sequence="85">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 215 were at the same grade levels. Two measures were used: end-of-year teacher grades and grade-equivalent scores from the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills. Both I.Q. and scores on the Iowa tests were somewhat above national averages. Both teachers' grades and achievement test scores favored first-born significantly, except for Work-Study Skills. Furthermore, greatest superiority of first-born children was shown in sibling pairs close in age, and for first-born girls. Asso and Wyke (18) investigated the significance of the orientation of the individual letters in the left-right reading habit. They used 88 reversible words of three- and four-letters, and 12 non-reversibles to avoid set. They were exposed tachistoscopically to experienced readers at eleven exposures ranging from 7.5 to 75 milli- seconds. The mean exposure time for recognition of the 100 cards was 20 to 25 msec. In the group including words normally oriented and those containing letter reversals, no significant time difference was found. In the group with letter reversals, the median number read from right to left was 29; in the normally oriented words, the median was 0.8. A comparison of each reversible word, read in two directions, was made in terms of frequency on the Thorndike-Lorge list. Among the normally-oriented words, 38 were read right-left; 31 of these were more frequent when read this way. To determine the effects of letter position in reversible words, the words were grouped by letter reversal as: beginning, end, and both. No significant differ- ences were found in letter positions so far as reading direction was concerned. The authors concluded that letter orientation provided an important cue to direction of reading a word. Soar (365) reported a follow-up analysis of reading growth during a summer (5 months) between fifth and sixth grades for four classrooms. Scores on the Vocabulary and Reading sub-tests of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills for two academic years and the inter- vening summer were considered. Teacher-pupil behavior in the class. room had been observed using the Amidon-Flanders Interaction Analysis and the Medley-Mitzel Observation Schedule and Record, as well as a Hostility-Affection Schedule. Two factors, emotional climate and control, were studied in relation to residual gains in vocabulary and reading. For vocabulary, differences in climate pro- duced no significant differences but differences in teacher control did, favoring indirect control. Neither factor nor the interaction was significant for reading. Exploration revealed that summer growth was as much or more than the previous year in 33 per cent of the group for vocabulary and 43 per cent for reading.</page><page sequence="86">216 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 An interaction analysis system classifying teacher influence into fact questions, thought questions, clarifying questions, teacher clues, and teacher informs was used by Davidson (91) in determining the effect of teacher behavior on children's thinking. Tape recorded teacher-pupil discussions of reading lessons designed to produce critical reading were analyzed. Although no data were presented, the author suggested that eight factors were characteristic of discussions in which critical reading was present. Included among these were questions that related closely to the material read or to children's own experiences, questions that asked for clarification or justifica- tion, pacing of teacher-pupil interaction slowly enough for pupils to respond, and capitalizing by the teacher on unanticipated re- sponses that were germane and thought-provoking. McGuigan and Bailey (266) repeated tests of chin and lip movement by electromyograms two and three years after they had shown considerable covert oral behavior during silent reading. The mean differences between resting and reading responses for all 16 subjects originally was 4.26 cm.; three years later it was .34 cm. Furthermore, no subvocalization during silent reading could be detected at the time of the follow-up. The mean response at the end of three years was similar to that of college students. IV-12 Factors related to reading disability The most extensive study of retarded readers was reported by Doehring (99). It was designed to determine what other abilities among boys with reading disability were subnormal and how these other disabilities might be related to the reading problems. A group of normal male readers was used for comparison with the disabled readers and in a few instances a group of normal female readers was used for replication. All subjects had Wechsler-Bellevue Perform- ance I.Q.'s of 90 or above. A battery of tests which yielded 109 measures included sensory, motor, perceptual, and verbal abilities. Neurological examinations on all retarded readers and on over half of the male normal readers and case histories for most of the subjects supplemented the testing. Analysis of covariance in a test- by-test comparison of retarded and normal readers revealed that the latter group was superior to the former in 62 of the 103 measures analyzed. The deficit pattern was characterized by an interaction of visual and verbal impairment, involving both verbal and non- verbal visual skills and both visual and auditory verbal skills. The re- tarded readers significantly surpassed the normal readers on several</page><page sequence="87">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 217 tasks requiring somesthetic input, a finding that suggested immature perception. Separate factor analyses were calculated for each group with a definite reading-spelling factor emerging as the major factor with a different composition in each group. For retarded readers, visual and verbal sequencing were highly correlated with reading, while for normal readers oral vocabulary test scores correlated highly with the reading factor. The multiple stepwise regression analysis identified four tests, other than those requiring reading or spelling, that discriminated the two groups: word rhyming and oral vocabu- lary, and discrimination of reversed figures and visual perceptual speed. The blind evaluations of the neuro-psychology tests adjudged a significantly larger number of retarded readers to have probable cerebral dysfunction. Lovell and Gorton (245) reported a study similar to the preceding one, using similar tests and design. Their matched groups of fifty normal and fifty backward readers had I.Q.'s at or above 85. Significant differences (.05) in mean scores favoring normal readers were found on reading age, language age, auditory-visual integration, sound-symbol association, spatial orientation, left-right discrimination, and the test of motor impairment. Coefficients of intercorrelation were analyzed factorially by the principal components procedure for each group separately. Six components appeared for each group; they accounted for 86 per cent of the variance in reading age for the backward readers and 77 per cent for the normal group. The component matrix was rotated to compare factor patterns for the two groups. The first factor,, auditory-visual integration and motor performance, correlated .65 with reading age in the retarded but not the normal group. The second factor correlated with little other than the measure of intelligence. The third factor correlated .36 with reading age, and appeared to be the ability to associate sound and symbol. The fourth factor, age, correlated .45 with read- ing age among the retarded. For the normal readers, the factors were: language age which correlated .89 with reading age, and others not related to reading. Except for age, which was common to both groups, the factors for the two groups did not correspond. McLeod (268) also compared retarded readers with normal readers using the sub-tests of the WISC and the ITA, Wepman's Auditory Discrimination Test, Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 4, auditory reproduction of words in context, written reproduc- tion of tachistoscopically-presented letter sequences, and an AR score from the Dyslexia Schedule questionnaire. A factor analysis yielded</page><page sequence="88">218 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY ? Winter 1970 V/2 five factors, only one of which (visual-motor) did not contribute to the prediction of group membership of the 46 subjects. The two factors making the largest contribution were called Sequencing- Integrative and Auditory Language Input Capacity. They were fol- lowed by Encoding and Planning. The four factors yielded a multiple correlation coefficient of about .85 with the criterion. Ayres (22) reported results of a factor analysis based on the 64 test scores from children assigned to public school classes for educational handicaps. No information was given on reading per se, although three reading scores appeared in the matrix along with one each of spelling and arithmetic. A wide variety of other tests included neuromuscular, perceptual, and cognitive measures. Test scores were standardized normatively first across subjects, then within subjects; then a between-subjects correlation was computed. The Q-technique factor analysis yielded six factors. The first factor was identified as involving auditory-language functions, sequencing, reading achievement, and possibly a hemisphere-hand dominance discrepancy. There was a recurrence of test scores on several factors, suggesting to the researcher a syndrome of disorders in postural and bilateral integration. Blank, Weider, and Bridger (37) investigated the onset of a phenomenon that they had found at fourth grade by testing chil- dren near the end of first grade. Two groups, retarded and normal, were matched for I.Q. on the Slosson Intelligence Test but differed in mean scores on the Word Recognition sub-test of the Gates Primary Reading Test. The first task, with three sub-tasks, involved selecting spatial dot patterns that represented spatially organized lights, spa- tial-temporal lights, and temporally organized lights. No significant differences (Mann-Whitney Test) were found between the groups in spatially organized lights but the normal readers significantly surpassed the retarded in the other two sub-tasks. The second task required matching of visual spatial patterns; no significant differences were found between the groups. Thus visual perceptual ability of retarded readers did not seem to account for the differences found in task one. Task three required verbal labeling of the sequence of lights organized, as in task one: spatially, spatial-temporally, and temporally. Significant differences were found only on the last sequence. Analysis of errors revealed that the retarded group had particular difficulty with pauses or spacing. Task four required no coding but reproduction of a rhyming sequence involving both dura- tion and accent. No significant differences were found between the</page><page sequence="89">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 219 two groups. The latter result was interpreted as suggesting that deficits on the first task were not due to difficulty in the perception of the rhythm of temporal sequences. The authors felt their results indicated that there were deficiencies in conceptualization present at the beginning stages of reading and that these deficiencies might be related causally to retardation. Otto (296) investigated idiosyncratic (inappropriate) versus consensual responses to 25 concrete nouns and to pictures by com- paring association responses of good and poor readers. Two methods of scoring the poor readers' responses were utilized: 11 the conven- tional plan based on consensuality among good readers; and 2] con- sensuality among all subjects. The poor readers were significantly more idiosyncratic on both types of scores. Words evoked signifi- cantly more consensual responses than pictures. The fourth and sixth graders did not differ from each other but both differed from the second graders. Differences among individual stimuli were signi- ficant. Two parts of a single report by Sabatino and Cramblett dealt with learning problems following viral encephalitis. Part I (338) included a description of the severe illness of 13 children and described the retest data at 6, 18, and 36 months. Results on the WISC revealed that the Verbal Comprehension was not impaired, whereas the Perceptual Organization and Freedom from Distract- ability was significantly impaired for six children. Differences between vocabulary, digit span, and coding were significant (.05). Only the digit span sub-test of the WISC showed a significant mean change over time. On the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test, more than half of the subjects showed clinically significant perceptual problems. On the Test of Auditory Perception, nine subjects were found with problems in discrimination, four with difficulties in auditory memory, and three with problems in auditory comprehension. On tests of academic achievement there was an increased trend over the three years toward underachievement, except for two children. Greater retardation was shown in comprehension than in word recognition. In Part II (339) the authors related various physical findings during illness to subsequent underachievement in reading comprehension. Those who stayed longer in the hospital and had seizures tended to be more retarded but no other relationships appeared. The auditory perceptual test was correlated with comprehension underachieve- ment and one part, auditory comprehension, yielded a significant coefficient of .59 with reading comprehension. Whatever interfered</page><page sequence="90">220 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 with reading comprehension also appeared to affect auditory compre- hension. Parents and teachers were asked to rate children's behavior. There was a significant difference between pre- and post-illness behavior ratings made by parents. Hyperactivity, restlessness, short attention span, and distractability characterized the children after illness. G. L. Johnson (200) investigated the associative learning and memory span of a group of retarded Negro readers by comparing their performances with achieving readers. Both groups were within the I.Q. range of 94 to 110 (Stanford-Binet) and had C.A.'s between 9.6 and 11.5. Retarded readers were boys who scored at or above grade in an appropriate informal hearing comprehension test but had word recognition and comprehension scores at about first-grade level. In contrast, achieving boys had reading quotients commensurate with their mental age. In addition to the intelligence test, the fol- lowing were given to all forty subjects: Grace Arthur Point Scale of Performance, Auditory Span test of the Bett's Ready to Read Tests, the Gates Associative Learning Tests, the Word Learning test of the Van Wagenen Reading Readiness Test, and sub-tests 4, 6, 9, 13, 16, and 18 of the Detroit Tests of Learning Aptitude. Digit Span Tests were used also. Statistical comparisons of most of these scores were made using Student's t to determine significance within groups and Fisher's t to compare means of groups. Group comparisons re- vealed that achieving readers significantly surpassed retarded readers in retaining: auditory words, syllables, visual objects, and letters; related sentences and unrelated words, objects, and letters; and unrelated verbal materials. They also earned higher mental ages on memory span tests compared to Binet M.A., retained visual digits forward better than auditory digits forward, and performed better on related materials presented arhythmically. In associative learning, adequate readers were superior to retarded in: visual-visual geometric materials and wordlike materials, word learning, and verbal oppo- sites. Case typings according to relationships among tests was pre- sented as a possible means of differentiating good and poor readers. Ellehammer (113) was concerned with auditory memory span, visual matching, and repeated oral reading of two stories. He used an auditory memory test with digits, and one with rows of syllables given under two conditions: monotonously, and with varied emphasis. The visual test required matching of word forms among similar distrac- tors. Oral reading called for the identification of 35 words. In addi-</page><page sequence="91">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 221 tion, stories were read five times orally and the following procedures employed: 1] pupils' errors and time were recorded; 2] help was provided so subjects could finish without errors; 3] the same pro- cedure as preceding was used; 4] pupils read without help and time and errors were recorded; and 5] procedure four was followed 24 hours later. The 21 dyslexic children were aged 10.5 to 13.5 years; the control group of 220 were the same ages. The subjects had no obvious deficiencies other than in reading. The average performance of the normal group was equal to about age 11 years and that of the dyslexic group about 7 years on the auditory memory test with numer- als. The difference between the two groups on language syllables was not as marked as for digits and most did less well on those presented monotonously. Only slight differences appeared on the word matching test, but marked differences were found in oral recognition of words. On first reading of the stories, the dyslexic group made about four times as many errors as did the normal group and required about three times as long. The dyslexic group improved markedly by the fourth reading, and maintained the improvement for the next reading 24 hours later. IV-13 Laterality and reading Maclean and Kean (252) reported a hand-eye coordination test which was administered by machine. It included six sub-tests in which the right and left hands were used with both eyes and with right eye and left eye. According to the report, the coefficient of cor- relation between scores on this test and reading level (origin unspeci- fied) at sixth grade was .198 and the authors commented that coeffi- cients were similar at other grades. Harcum (159) explored the effects of redundancy and spacing on retinal hemifield perception. Four conditions were set up: CW (compound words); WN (four-letter word with pronounce- able nonsense word); NW (the reverse of the former); and WW (prefix and suffix words shuffled to form meaningless compound words). Two control conditions were composed of NN (20 pro- nounceable nonsense words) and 1W (20 meaningful words). In addition, two conditions were set up, each for 16 subjects: the closed condition, with letters evenly spaced, and the spaced condition with the fourth and fifth letters widely spaced. Practice periods were pro- vided and explanations given of how words were arranged. Subjects fixated at the center before a .07 second tachistoscope exposure.</page><page sequence="92">222 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 Results revealed that four subjects showed no errors under CW with patterns evenly spaced, but seven exhibited left superiority and three showed no difference. Under the 1W condition, eight had no errors, three made fewer errors to the right, three to the left, and two an equal number, indicating that there were small hemifield differences for high-redundancy words. In contrast with little redundancy under NN condition, there was a large hemifield difference with strong superiority in accuracy of the left hemifield. Thus the conclusion was reached that redundancy reduced the hemifield difference. How- ever, the WW condition produced right superiority. When spacing was changed, the number of subjects who changed superior hemifields was significant. The findings were interpreted as negating fixed capabilities of retinal hemifields or cerebral dominance and as sug- gesting individual differences in methods of coding total configura- tions into the mnemonic storage system. Winters and Gerjuoy (405) examined hemifield superiority under conditions which could not (.01 seconds exposure) and could (.3) permit eye movements. To determine the effects of reading experience, subjects were chosen from three populations: 1] educable retardates (C.A.=15.8), 2] equal C.A. normals; and 3] equal M.A. normals (M.A.=10.3). Consonants (except Q) were randomly sel- ected and assigned to each corner of a square position on each card making a total of ten cards. The cards were exposed tachistoscopic- ally, following a training period, to each of the thirty subjects in each of the three groups. Subjects reported aloud the letters that they saw. Comparisons of correct responses revealed no sex differ- ences. More correct responses were given with long than with short exposure. The group of subjects differed significantly in number of correct responses under long exposure. The order, fewest to most, was: retardates, equal-M.A. normals, and equal-C.A. normals. There were significantly more correct responses to the right than to the left hemifield targets under short exposure for retardates and the equal-C.A. group, but no significant differences in any group under long exposure. Letters were perceived in the upper half more often than in the lower half. Under long exposure, the sequence of cor- rect responses by quadrant was recorded for each subject. The most common pattern was: upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right. The findings were interpreted to show right hemifield superi- ority only when scanning was impossible but that this effect was not due to experience.</page><page sequence="93">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 223 IV-14 Personality, self-concept, and reading Hake (155) developed the Reading Apperception Test, con- sisting of ten ambiguous pictures relating to reading situations, to compare covert responses of good and poor readers. Also, a Pupil Behavior by Teacher Rating Scale was developed and filled in to determine overt behavior. Reading scores on the California Achieve- ment Tests were used to identify two groups of 40 students each having average intelligence but reading above- and below-average. No significant relations (r=.06) were found between scores for overt and covert tests. Comparison of groups revealed that the poor readers were significantly less well-adjusted than the good readers. Likewise, the teachers' ratings of poor readers were significantly negative compared with good readers. Sex differences on the two types of tests approached significance (.06) with girls less well adjusted. Comparisons on the Reading Apperception Test of good and poor readers revealed significant differences at the .01 level in the follow- ing factors: 1] attitudes toward home and parents; 2] attitudes toward reading-teacher-school; 3] defense mechanisms; 4] self-con- cept; and 5] aggression. No differences in anxiety were found. Hansen (158) investigated the home literary environments as it related to reading attitude, achievement, and volume of reading. For this purpose, a reading attitude scale was devised and validated (item analysis) and then given to all fourth-grade pupils in a district. The number of boys and girls was held equal and four groups of twelve each from among those who scored highest and lowest on the scale became the subjects. Mothers of all subjects were interviewed, using a constructed home literary environment measure giving a seven- point ranking. Father's occupation and education as well as the number of siblings were tabulated. The school provided reading test and I.Q. scores. The number of books read was taken from the school library records and confirmed by interview. Multiple regression analysis revealed that home literary environment was the only factor contributing to independent reading and explained a significant por- tion of the variance in a child's reading attitude. Both literary environ- ment and I.Q. combined to account for the variance in reading achievement. None of the factors accounted for any portion of volume of reading. Girls scored significantly higher than boys on the attitude scale and read a greater number of books. The foregoing information was not supported by published data.</page><page sequence="94">224 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 Lockhart (241) compared scores on the California Test of Personality to Paragraph Meaning scores on the Stanford Achieve- ment Test. The coefficient between reading and the Personal Adjust- ment sub-section was .47, between reading and the Social Adjustment sub-section, .25; and between reading and the total test, .50. The same pupils had taken the California Test of Personality and the Metropolitan Readiness Tests three years earlier. At that time the coefficients of readiness with personal adjustment was .51, and with the total score, .38. A comparison of current percentile rank of mean achievement scores suggested that the group achieved at a level somewhat higher than their adjustment scores. Subscores for Social Skills and Personal Worth were at, or above, the 50th per- centile; Freedom from Anti-social Tendencies ranked lowest. Haywood (170) investigated intrinsic-extrinsic motivation at three I.Q. levels, comparing underachievers with overachievers. All pupils were within three months of 10.0 years of age. Achievement in reading, spelling, and arithmetic was determined by the Metropoli- tan Achievement Tests. Z-scores at each five-point I.Q. interval were computed so that overachievers (+ 1.00) and underachievers (-1.00) could be identified. Surplus subjects were eliminated ran- domly to leave 150 subjects, equal numbers in I.Q. ranges 65-80, 95-109, and 120 or above. The choice motivator scale was admin- istered, using cards to determine reasons for forced choice among 20 pairs of vocational titles. Scores included IM (motivator), EM (hy- giene), and IM minus EM, a difference (D) score. Plots of mean D scores revealed no overlap in the scores between overachievers and underachievers in reading, revealing that the former group is more intrinsically and the latter more extrinsically motivated. Analysis of variance showed a main effect of I.Q. level also, with bright children more intrinsically motivated. Stavrianos and Landsman (374) searched for patterns of responses to the Rorschach Test among 311 privileged boys, two thirds of whom showed lag or dysfunction in some aspect of the per- ceptual-motor process; 151 were adequate readers and 160, deficient. The Rorschach patterns included: normal, mild outer restriction, severe outer restriction, inner restriction, constriction, acting out, and perseveration and/or rejection. Four-way comparisons of ade- quate and deficient readers, with and without perceptual-motor prob- lems, yielded myriad differences within and among categories on the Rorschach accompanied by age changes. The data seem to sup- port the conclusion that deficient readers exhibited relatively few</page><page sequence="95">Summary of reading research - WEINTRAUB, et al 225 normally balanced and mature personality patterns. No signficant differences in personality appeared between adequate and deficient readers with perceptual-motor dysfunction, although many trends were found. The differences were more closely related to intelligence and age than to reading difficulty. Shirley (355) explored the effects of reading on high school students. She used a modified critical incident technique to obtain reports of personal reactions. A questionnaire was supple- mented and validated by interviews and case studies. Intelligence was measured by the Otis Beta and reading by the California Reading Tests. Students were asked to write specifically how books, poems, or articles had affected their attitudes, ideas, or behavior. Two analysts coded twenty protocols to classify influences on concept, attitude, and behavior. Per cent of agreements were about 79, 59, and 94 respec- tively. Seven areas of influence, in order of frequency, were: Self Image, Philosophy of Life, Cultural Groups, Social Problems, Sensi- tivity to People, Political Science, and Miscellaneous. Only 16 of 420 students reported no influences. Of the 1184 influences, 45 per cent were concepts, 40 per cent attitudes, and 15 per cent behavioral responses. Self-involvement was categorized as: the indifferent, the observer, the participator, the synthesizer, and the decision-maker. The synthesizer was the major type of self-involvement. Shirley found significant positive (.01) relationships between total influences and intelligence, vocabulary, and comprehension as well as number of materials read. Negative relationships were found with age and grade level. Comparing the top and bottom 15 according to intelli- gence revealed no differences in influences of reading. Combinations of the three influences were found too. The ten books most frequently reported (6 to 43 times) as influencing students were listed, with Black Like Me and the Bible ranking highest. Of the influential read- ings reported 77 per cent were chosen voluntarily. Fiction and non- fiction were distributed about equally. Athey (19) analyzed each of 300 items comprising the Uni- versity of California inventory for personality to determine which ones differentiated students who ranked in the top and bottom quartiles of the reading sub-test on the Stanford Achievement Test. Two samples of 130 and 160 ninth graders served as subjects, one group to cross validate the other. New personality scores were secured by rescoring each test, using only the differentiating items. The pool of sixty items correlated .53 for the total sample. Intercorrelations of the items were factor analyzed using Hotelling's component factor tech-</page><page sequence="96">226 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 nique. Four factors were identified. Factor I appeared to be an autonomy syndrome. On this factor poor readers appeared to be more dependent and docile than good readers. Factor II was identified as self-concept. On it the poor readers appeared to lack self-confidence and have a pervasive sense of inferiority. Factor III included dis- likes about school. Poor readers disliked social aspects of the school primarily. Factor IV was labelled family orientation. Compared to good readers, poor readers were closer to parents, depending on them rather than peers. The author characterized these good readers as having successfully completed Erikson's first four stages while the poor readers had not. Another study, by Kling (218), attempted to determine the Nature of Holmes' Mobilizers. The Nelson-Denny Reading Test was used to pre- and post-test 228 college freshmen. In addition the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values was included in pre-testing. Statistically significant gains were made in rate but not in compre- hension during the eight week (16 hours) period of instruction. Coefficients of correlation of rate and comprehension gains with each of the six basic value types for the entire group yielded very low coefficients with only two (.173 and -.140) significant (.05). Separate analyses by sex were no more productive. The author sug- gested that a reading-value scale might be more promising in research. Bloomer (43) accumulated answers to four sociometric questions dealing with selection of children whom their classmates would or would not take to the movies. Thus 450 children were identi- fied as accepted, rejected, isolates, or of high ambivalent impact. Comparisons of these four groups revealed that the rejected group tended to be older; had significantly lower I.Q.'s than two of the other groups; and showed significantly lower reading achievement (Metropolitan) than any of the other groups. The Reading Skills Diagnostic Test was given to all pupils. Differences on sub-tests were compared among the four sociometric groups. Sub-tests were grouped into those requiring memorization and those involving analysis and synthesis concepts. There were no significant differences among the four groups on skills requiring memorization. The rejected children were significantly inferior to the accepted on all tests of analysis and synthesis and inferior to the other two groups on isolated sub-tests. IV-15 Socio-cultural factors and reading Wakefield and Silvaroli (388) investigated the oral language of twenty beginning first-grade pupils of low socio-economic status</page><page sequence="97">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 227 in each of three ethnic groups: Anglo, Negro, and Spanish. The lan- guage sample was a response to pictures and was taped. Subsequently the transcripts were analyzed according to the Indiana Conference Scheme. Analysis of variance of total sentence patterns revealed no significant differences among the three groups. Analysis of specific language patterns yielded no significant differences except in requests and commands which was used more frequently by Spanish than by Anglo or Negro children. Implications for instructional materials for these pupils are given. Blanton (38) arranged for Negro retarded readers from disadvantaged areas to respond to a three-item multiple choice in- ventory of twenty items. The remedial teachers gave the inventories to groups of three subjects. Analysis of the responses revealed that these pupils (77 per cent) saw reading as something done for the teacher and (49 per cent) to make the teachers happy. More than half believed that a good reader moves his lips, and says the words to himself. The majority of these children responded that everyone should learn to read because of the practical consequences of doing so. Labov and Robins (227) made a preliminary report on the reading levels and interests of pre-adolescent groups of boys in the Harlem tenement areas. Half or more of the boys were 10 to 16 years of age. In their study of vernacular phonology and grammar, some pupils were given Gray's Standardized Oral Reading Paragraphs and recordings were made. Records from the New York City schools on the reading section of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests were made available to the investigators for 75 boys. A group of boys who were not members of the street group was studied for comparison. Results showed that 11 of 32 were reading at or above grade while others were reading as much as two years below grade level. In con- trast, the 43 members of the street group were greatly retarded. Only one boy read at grade level and the majority scored three or more years below grade and none above fifth grade. Moreover, the authors reported that there was no overall deficiency in verbal skills; indeed, some of the verbal leaders were among the poorer readers. The major problem appeared to be the fact that these students viewed the educational system with profound cynicism. Kappelman, Kaplan, and Ganter (205) reported on the re- sults of a school health team assessment of 306 disadvantaged chil- dren with learning disorders. Data from seven types of specialists were pooled to categorize the diagnosis into one of eight groups with therapy prescribed accordingly. Descriptions of the diagnostic</page><page sequence="98">228 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY ? Winter 1970 V/2 procedures were given and four case studies illustrated procedures. In this group of urban slum children, 171 (55.6 per cent) were diagnosed as having organic learning handicaps. Cultural depriva- tion alone was considered the predominant cause of disability in only 6 per cent. Educational immaturity was identified in 14 per cent, and emotional disturbance was a predominant factor in about one fourth of the cases. A report by G. B. Linn (237), related language-cultural background to reading and speech. Three groups were used: E-S, composed of children who had spoken both English and Spanish before school entrance; A-E, children who had spoken only English; and M-E, children who had spoken only English but whose parents or grandparents had come from Mexico. Thirty children were in each group, 10 at seventh and 20 at eighth grades, 14 boys and 16 girls. All were given the California Test of Mental Maturity and no signi- ficant differences were found in the non-language I.Q.'s for the groups. The following tests were given: reading-language sections of the California Achievement Tests, junior high level, the Gray Oral Reading Test, the Wepman Auditory Discrimination Test, a phonetic inventory, a three-minute recorded speech sample, and sound spectrums of vowel productions. There were no significant differences between the A-E and M-E groups on the achievement tests. The A-E group was significantly superior to the E-S group in silent reading comprehension, oral reading accuracy and compre- hension, general language development, and inflection. Several differ- ences in pronunciation of vowels were found. Gredler (146) explored the value of the Minnesota Percepto- Diagnostic Test (MPD) with children from culturally disadvantaged backgrounds. Subjects were Negro and Caucasian who had I.Q.'s between 80 and 110 on the Goodenough-Harris Drawing Test. In addition to the foregoing, they were given the reading battery of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. Also, teachers rated the adjustment of each pupil on the Child Behavior Rating Scale. No significant differences between Negro and Caucasian subjects in intelligence were found. However, the Negro group had significantly (.05) higher rotation scores on the MPD test and the means of both groups could be rated as pathological. Both groups scored below norms on the reading tests but there were no significant differences between the two groups. Teacher's ratings reflected average adjustment. Teacher ratings and MPD rotation scores tended toward reverse relationships. Finally, a comparison was made with 15 clinic subjects, similar in</page><page sequence="99">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 229 all respects except lower in reading. The clinic subjects had signifi- cantly higher rotation scores. IV-16 Reading interests Emans (116) offered 22 inner-city children six pairs of stories for choice as to the city theme or the family-friends-pets theme. Because the children had not begun to read, the pairs of stories were read to them and they were asked to point to the one they preferred to hear again. The order of the stories, the themes, and the readers were varied systematically. The family-friends-pets theme was chosen 80 times while the city theme was chosen 52 times, a difference highly significant (.005). The study was repli- cated with 14 boys and 10 girls with similar results. The predictions of 15 of the 16 adults who read the stories was in opposition to the findings. Ford and Koplyay (127) used a set of sixty pictures and an equal number of sentences portraying the action in each picture in order to study children's story preferences. Kindergarten and first- grade children were asked to mark the one picture on each page indicating a story they would most like to read and the one they would not want to read. At second and third grades the sentences were read to the children and marked in the same way. The topics were most liked in the following order: Negro heritage, children in ghetto, history and science, children in general, fantasy, and animals. The differences were statistically significant. Five of the ten best liked pictures belonged to the history-science category. Of the ten most disliked pictures, four related to fantasy and four to animals. Slight changes with age and sex were noted. The results from the sentences confirmed those from the pictures. The authors concluded that children's interests are related to age and sex to a greater extent than to socio-economic background. Rankin and Thames (317) used an interview technique with recorded stories to determine first graders' preferences for unfamiliar animal stories taken from a phonics reader and a basal reading series. The two stories were selected at random, taking length and reading difficulty into consideration. Children were asked to make four distinctions: 4 (like a lot), 3 (like), 2 (don't know), and 1 (do not like). Then they were asked why, how they would improve each story, and finally, which story they preferred. Averages were computed for each child across the four categories of story, illustration, characters, and ending. No significant differ-</page><page sequence="100">230 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 ences (sign test) were found between the first and last categories, but the preferences for the phonics book was significant in the other two areas. In the forced choice, 14 preferred the phonics story, 5 chose the basal story, and 1 refused to make a choice. No significant sex differences were found on this choice. There was no clear pattern in the children's explanations of why they liked a particular story. Farr and Roden (123) examined the effects of exposure to reading instruction on attitude toward reading with special atten- tion to degree of success in achievement. In both the kindergarten and first-grade classes, children were given a choice between reading about a space ship or drawing it. In kindergarten, there were no significant difference among the numbers choosing the two activities in any of the three classes. At the first grade level, however, signifi- cant differences favored drawing. The Gates Primary Reading Test provided scores at first grade to test the differences in achievement; none were found. When children were divided into high, average, and low achievement groups, there were no significant differences in the choice of reading or drawing. The contrast between kinder- garten and first-grade choices was interpreted as a trend toward unfavorable attitudes toward reading. Roderick (327) examined reading choices and reasons for responses among 100 pupils at grade six. Available scores on three verbal tasks of the Minnesota Tests of Creative Thinking were used to rank subjects into three groups designated as high, middle, and low creative. The subjects read from thirty titles for a period of three months, recorded their preferences among the titles, and their reasons. The books had been rated by authorities in children's literature as to their appeal to most and least creative children. Analysis of variance and chi square revealed that there were signifi- cant differences among the groups in the number of books from the list that were read. Also, the three groups differed significantly in their preference for books judged to appeal to high creatives but not to low creatives. Children commented more frequently on liter- ary components and formats of books while judges commented on character, reading involvement, and external influences. Zais (415) described the steps in constructing a scale of Sophistication of Reading Interests (SRIS) in fiction. He used fic- titious story synopses, equated for lengths, readability level, and other variables. The stories were placed into 39 triads of least, mod- erately, and most sophisticated. Twenty secondary English teachers</page><page sequence="101">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 231 ranked the triads and the resultant Kendall Coefficients of Concord- ance were significant (.01). Attempts at validation were made by re- ducing the triads to thirty pairs or dyads with three different com- parisons, and adding five false response checks. Teachers in four classes were asked to rank their pupils for sophistication of interests so that scores on the revised SRIS could be compared. The Rho values were significant (about .57 and .40) for two classes and approached zero for the other two. Comparison by classes revealed significant differences between older (twelfth grade) and younger (seventh grade) students. Likewise, intelligence appeared to be related to SRIS scores. The reliability, by split half procedure, was about .74. Item discrimination revealed that when six dyads were eliminated to improve the test, the reliability was less than a half point lower. The scale was offered as a beginning means for studying a qualitative aspect of reading interests. Brown and Newman (57) reported some general charac- teristics of 207 subjects who enrolled in literacy classes and some comparisons of those who made considerable progress (high achievers) with those who made no measurable gains (low achievers). The high achievers, as compared with the low, tended to be less frequently on welfare, more frequently female than male, to have come from less deprived backgrounds, and to have varied causes for their difficulty. They tended to show preference for science and more sophisticated titles than did the poor achievers. A sample of 175 subjects was used to report results of individual forced choices of categories. The categories chosen, in order of frequency, dealt with were: 1] family, self-improvement, jobs, and health; 2] religion; 3] sociological, historical, and civic titles. Those least frequently chosen dealt with: 1] sports, adventure, and travel; 2] children, ani- mals, and humor; and 3] science and math. Bloomer (41) examined one aspect of high- and low-circu- lation books to determine comparative characteristics of heroes and villains. Each was rated on the Identification Figure Test using an anchored judgment scale of 17 items. The judgments from 35 graduate students were combined. Comparisons of the scores on a seven-point scale were made between the heroes and villains on the combined high-and-low circulation books. While many individual characteristics appeared as differentiating the different combina- tions, a high degree of conflict between hero and villain appeared to be best liked.</page><page sequence="102">232 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 IV-17 Readability and legibility The first five studies dealt with techniques for determining levels of readability. McLaughlin (267) adapted and simplified the Fog Index, naming it the SMOG Grading plan. This formula required selecting ten sentences near the beginning, middle, and end of a selection, and then counting every word of three or more syllables. The square root of the number of polysyllabic words was then estimated and three was added. The result was the reading grade level a reader must have achieved in order to comprehend the text fully. The McCall-Crabbs Standard Test Lessons in Reading were used as criteria with all key ideas reproduced. Several regression equations were obtained in order to find the simplest. The cofficient of correlation of this equation with the criterion was about .98 and the standard error, about 1.5 grades. Using 64 university students reading eight selections, there was a perfect negative rank correla- tion betwen SMOG Grade scores and the comprehension level divided by time for reading. Elley (115) used nouns to predict readability level be- cause he found nouns most difficult for readers to supply in cloze tests. His formula required calculating the average frequency level of nouns in three passages, each long enough to contain about twenty nouns. After trying various frequency word lists, the author chose the New Zealand Council for Educational Research (NZCER) list with an eighth level at the upper end. The list was presented in the article, along with directions for calculating the approximate grade level. Elley's criterion measures were passages of about 150 words from school readers, magazines, and newspapers. From eight to 16 passages were used in the validation studies. They were ranked by teachers and top-stream pupils, ages 12 to 15. Rank correlations with pooled ratings of the noun frequency level ranged from .85 to .95 on five studies with a median of .90. Comparisons of word lists with the criterion resulted in recommendation of the Spelling List of the Board of Education of New York City for use in the U.S.A. although the NZCER list was best for New Zealand. Fry (135) reported directions for using a revised form of his Readability Graph, based on three 100-word passages drawn from near the beginning, middle, and end of a book. The average number of sentences and the average number of syllables were plotted on the graph from which the approximate grade equivalent</page><page sequence="103">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 233 was read. Based on the results of comprehension questions from ten books used in a grade ten class, rank-order coefficients of correlation were .93 for the Fry, .94 for the Flesch, and .90 for the Dale-Chall. The Fry ratings correlated .94 with the latter and .96 with the Flesch score. Further validations of the Fry (136) Readability Graph were reported at primary level. Selections from seven books were used to compare the Spache formula, cloze errors made by second and third graders, and oral reading errors made by the same children. The rank-order coefficients of correlation of the Fry Graph with the other measures were: Spache, .90, doze, .95, and oral reading, .90. The report on a readability formula by Aquino (12) dealt with the Miller-Coleman Readability Scale (MCRS). The MCRS was validated against a bilateral cloze test (second guess of every word in the passage), word-for-word recall, and ranked judgment of diffi- culty of 36 passages. The last two were obtained from 14 adult subjects. All four criteria ranked the passages in approximately the same order with coefficients of intercorrelation ranging from .89 to .94. The conclusion was reached that the cloze procedure is a suitable device for ranking difficulty of passages. The passages, with their ratings, were presented in the appendix. Smith (361) used the Dale-Chall formula to determine the readability level of 22 mathematics textbooks. He found that the readability levels ranged from below fourth grade to college level. Only 6 of 11 texts were appropriate for seventh grade for which they were designed. A similar analysis of eighth-grade texts yielded a range from below fourth grade to college graduate level with only five being appropriate. The remaining reports focused on different aspects of legi- bility. Erdmann and Neal (117) studied legibility of words as a function of horizontal and vertical resolution and character size. Word familiarity and length were additional parameters studied. Contrast was not varied. Comparisons were made of the legibility of letters in isolation and in words. A test booklet, designed for the investigation, included 144 familiar and 144 unfamiliar words of equal length, both varying from three to eight letters. Character heights varied from 40 to 100 mils (about 12-point type). Letters were altered by digital facsimile reproduction making five different horizontal and four vertical resolutions. Subjects were 42 college students with 20/20 vision. Each subject read aloud the words and</page><page sequence="104">234 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 letters, page by page. If words could not be pronounced, they could be spelled. Computer analysis revealed that most of the twenty reso- lution combinations were completely accurate with 100- and 80-mil characters. However, at 60- and 40-mil, the range was sufficient to perform an analysis of variance to determine the effect of word length and familiarity. Negligible effects of length were found, but familiarity produced significant differences. The legibility of letters increased systematically with character height and with resolution. Familiar words and individual letters were more legible than un- familiar words under all conditions. Letter legibility correlated .98 with familiar words and .94 with unfamiliar words. Poulton (312) investigated the effects of transfer from Siemens teleprinter type to elite and vice versa. He used three pass- ages of about 450 words each, allowed subjects 90 seconds for reading, then permitted time to answer ten open-ended questions. Groups of 10 good readers and 11 poor readers were assigned to each of three conditions, using either elite or Siemens: control (read the same throughout); transfer prewarned (practice in both, tests 1 and 2 in one type and test 3 in the other); transfer unwarned (previous and two tests in one and third test in the other). This design permitted a study of the tests, which proved not to be equal in difficulty. Taking this into account, the investigator found no significant differences among the conditions for good readers. Among the groups of poor readers, analysis of variance revealed significant differences (.02). Specifically, poor readers scored higher on the elite than on the Siemens; the group that transferred from Siemens to elite did less well on the latter; the group that transferred from elite to Siemens scored higher on the Siemens. The foregoing was interpreted to be a two-way assymmetrical transfer effect. Correlation of overall rate of reading with the Tinker Speed of Reading Test was .56, raised to .84 after correction for attenuation. Two studies dealt with practical aspects of legibility. Poulton (313) tested the ability of housewives to identify ingredients of packages under 40 and 2 footcandles of light using different type size. The Univers type was used in sizes of about 10-, 7.5-, 6- and 4-point type with leading from 1.0 to .4 points. A target word was given to each subject who then found the word in the corresponding list and crossed it out. In the bright light, differences between 4- and 6-point type were significant as were differences between 6- and 10-point. In the dim light, a significant difference was found between 4- and 6-point type but not between any of the others. Several sub-</page><page sequence="105">Summary of reading research WENTRAUB, et al. 235 jects over 50 years could locate none of the targets in 4-point type. The conclusion was reached that food manufacturers should not use print under 6-point Univers, or its equivalent in other type faces. Hailstone and Foster (154) reported on legibility of labelling for drugs. In the first experiment, 24 students selected the required instructions for medication from 100 typewritten or handwritten (by ten different people) labels displayed on a board. The time re- quired to locate the labels was recorded and compared. The mean time for typewritten instructions was significantly superior (.01) to handwritten. The latter required nearly 46 per cent longer time. In the second experiment, 33 nurses searched printed labels for names of drugs. They were printed in 6- or 10-point type, upper- and lower-case letters, and centered or displayed to the left of center. The time required to make the selections was compared and no significant differences were found in layout. Labels in 10-point type were selected significantly faster than those in 6-point type. No significant difference was found in upper- and lower-case type for 10-point labels, but upper-case required significantly less time than lower-case in 6-point type. Kastl and Child (208) investigated the connotative meaning of type faces. Thirty-two types were divided into two sets: 1] angular or curved, bold or light, simple or ornate; and 2] angular or curved, bold or light, serif or sans-serif. Subjects viewed 32 slides eight times, rating each on a five-point scale for sets of moods such as: sprightly, cheerful, bright, vivacious, happy, gay, joyous; or digni- fied, spiritual, solemn, sober, serious, grave, earnest, lofty, philo- sophical. After the mood selections, each subject classified the type according to its physical qualities. General agreement was obtained on the physical-quality classification. The mood ratings tended to be low but many significant differences appeared in the analyses of vari- ances. Details must be obtained from the study with only the general scheme reported here. Adjective groups which express happiness, joviality, and delicacy tended to be associated with light, ornate, and possibly sans-serif type faces. Adjective groups which express dramatic, forceful, serious, and philosophical moods tended to be associated with the angular, bold, and possibly serif type faces. V. The teaching of reading For the first time in a number of years, the sub-section on reading in the primary grades does not contain the largest number of published studies in the teaching of reading category. The largest</page><page sequence="106">236 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY 0 Winter 1970 V/2 sub-section this year is on testing, consisting of a number of reports on the development and validation of tests. V-1 Status of reading instruction The growing number of surveys investigating various aspects of reading programs is indicative of the profession's increased inter- est in finding out what services exist and who is being served. This year's surveys dealt primarily with high school reading programs, although two studies of kindergarten through grade twelve programs and a questionnaire survey of a college reading program also ap- peared in the literature. Smith and Austin (360) summarized the procedures and findings of their Office of Education-funded survey in which Title I programs first were categorized and then promising practices identi- fied. Through reading a number of proposal abstracts and full length proposals, a classification scheme including the following six cate- gories was developed: 1] developmental programs, 2] remedial reading projects, 3] enrichment programs, 4] special programs, 5] in-service education, and 6] combination projects. Criteria for evaluating programs and identifying promising practices of model programs were then established in consultation with outside con- sultants and directors of Title I projects. One mailed and one fol- low-up telephone questionnaire were developed, the latter formulated from a pilot study done in Ohio. Based on the results of the two questionnaires completed by 632 school systems, 40 projects were designated as model programs and slated for site visitations. Of these, 34 were actually visited. All information was then tabulated and samples of the findings reported. Of the participating systems, more than half were classified as having remedial programs while almost 30 per cent had combination programs of some sort. Nearly two thirds of the systems covered levels kindergarten to grade twelve in their Title I project while approximately one fourth more included kindergarten to grade six only. The site visits turned up 14 different innovations used in the model programs. The innova- tions ranged from early admissions to special facilities for use with disadvantaged. Several recommendations for each of the various programs were presented. Farr, Harris, Laffey, and Smith (122) reported the findings of two state-wide questionnaire surveys of reading programs in Indiana, one at the elementary level and one at the secondary level. Although some of the purposes for the two surveys were different,</page><page sequence="107">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 237 at both levels the nature, organizational structure, and the special problems connected with each program were investigated. In addi- tion, the elementary survey included information on materials, tests, types of remedial and summer programs, and school personnel re- sponsible for directing the program. The secondary survey asked for data on the nature and degree of satisfaction with present pro- grams, the impact of NDEA and ESEA funds on reading programs, and the experience and training in reading of secondary reading teachers and school administrators. A return greater than 80 per cent was received on each survey. Only highlights of the findings can be reported here. At the elementary level, the most typical organizational pattern reported was a modified self-contained plan (68.3 per cent) with most schools also reporting some experimenta- tion underway with other organizational forms. Two series of basal readers were identified as the most commonly used throughout the state. A wide variety of other materials supplemented the basal readers. Standardized tests were given as the most common form of testing, but respondents also acknowledged that teachers needed more skill in interpreting and using these instruments. The greatest need identified by respondents grew from classroom teachers' lack of knowledge of specific skills. At the secondary level, about three fourths of the schools had a required reading course at one or more grade levels (seven to twelve) with the basic responsibility usually assigned to English teachers. Fewer than half of the reading teachers had taken a course in reading. Lack of qualified personnel was the most serious problem cited in extending the reading program. The study gave recommendations for the improvement of both elementary and secondary reading programs in Indiana. In his survey of public secondary schools, Graham (144) mailed out questionnaires to one secondary school in each Cali- fornia district having a secondary school. Responses were received from 85.3 per cent of the total group. Ten schools were then visited in order to corroborate the questionnaire data. Of those schools reporting, 78 per cent had reading programs and more than 75 per cent reported programs were less than five years old. Programs were primarily organized as special reading classes stressing remedial techniques and basic instruction on general reading abilities. The major problems identified in setting up a reading program were lack of funds and qualified personnel although 84 per cent of the reading teachers claimed to have had training in reading. Teacher and counselor recommendation, grades, and standardized test scores</page><page sequence="108">238 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 were the most common bases for selecting students for special in- struction. About seventy different intelligence tests were named as the most commonly used in identification of remedial cases. In 75 per cent of the programs, multi-level reading kits were used and mechanical devices of various sorts were part of most reading programs. Only 25 per cent of the schools reported some type of follow-up on students after they left the reading program and another 25 per cent indicated a planned instructional program in their system covering grades one to twelve. In another state-wide survey, Larson (230) canvassed a geographical sample of 107 secondary personnel, each representing a different school system. The questionnaire survey sought information on the number of certified reading personnel, type and extent of program development, advocated trends, evidence of program valid- ity, goals and objectives of the programs, and philosophies of sec- ondary reading instruction. From the 73 completed responses, it was found that there were 153 certified reading personnel in grades seven to nine and 44 in grades ten to twelve. Both remedial and developmental reading programs were being offered at each grade level, although the number of remedial programs exceeded the de- velopmental programs offered. The most frequently listed objectives of the developmental program included improving vocabulary, com- prehension, and study skills as well as developing critical thinking and reference skills. For remedial reading, boosting morale and improving listening, writing, penmanship, and spelling skills were frequently listed objectives as well as developing vocabulary, better comprehension, and upgrading reading level. Tabulation of com- mitment to various types of programs demonstrated that there was widespread support for both remedial and developmental programs. A questionnaire survey of secondary school reading programs in British Columbia was reported by Chronister and Ahrendt (77). They differentiated the reported programs as remedial-corrective, college-bound, or developmental. Only 7 schools reported a program in reading for the college bound student, while 33 reported having a developmental program, and 116 reported having a remedial- corrective program. Of the latter programs, 19 employed a full-time remedial reading teacher, and 77 utilized a teacher with no formal training in reading. Time allotment for reading instruction in the remedial-corrective program ranged from two to five hours per week, and 25 classes had more than 15 pupils per class. Students tended to be selected by teacher referral, although 42 of the pro-</page><page sequence="109">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 239 grams reported using special testing for admission to remedial class. The developmental reading programs were generally the responsibility of English teachers. In Lowe's (246) survey, 53 Florida institutions of higher learning were contacted regarding their reading improvement pro- grams. Replies were received from 47 of the schools, 10 of which did not offer any reading program. Seven of this latter group indicated a desire for such a program, however. Of the schools that had reading improvement programs, about two thirds replied that the program had been started in or since 1960. The greatest number of programs (13) were sponsored by the English Department with the Guidance and Education Departments next in order of the number of programs under their jurisdiction. In 16 of the schools, academic credit was given for the course; about half of the schools indicated that their programs met three times a week in hourly sessions for a semester, trimester, or quarter. Ten programs had one full time instructor while one program listed 18 full time and nine part time personnel on its staff. The number of students served by the various programs ranged from 20 to 2228. Most of the programs listed various kinds of pacers, tachistoscopes, films, and workbooks among the materials used. V-2 Comparative studies Martin (258) compared findings of a 1968 survey of upper Midwest (Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and North and South Dakota) secondary reading programs with data from a 1962 survey of the same area. In particular, he was interested in noting the effect of federal aid funds on the area's secondary reading programs. Schools, assigned to three strata on the basis of number of teachers employed, were asked to respond to questions on the administration, general characteristics, specific practices, and funding of the program as well as to supply information about students. The 1968 questionnaire return was 90 per cent, a gain of 6.5 per cent over the return from the earlier survey. The findings gave evidence that almost half of the schools reporting were receiving support from federal funds amounting to one half the cost of their reading program. The num- ber of schools providing organized reading instruction for retarded readers had increased by about 12 per cent over the previous survey. The major problems reported were the same in the two surveys: a lack of qualified personnel and budget deficits. Two thirds of the schools replying felt they had a successful reading program in 1968</page><page sequence="110">240 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY ? Winter 1970 V/2 whereas in the earlier survey, over three fourths of the replies had indicated their programs were not satisfactory. V-3 Early reading During the year covered by this annual summary, several studies appeared that dealt with the reading of pre-first-grade chil- dren. One of these presented longitudinal data through grade three on children who had been taught to read in kindergarten. A second reported a case study of an early reader, while a third investigated programed teaching of 14 words to kindergarten children. Sutton (382) presented children with a permissive reading environment in kindergarten and compared the reading achievement scores of those who had learned to read (Group A) with the scores of those who did not choose to read in kindergarten (Group B) at the end of grades one, two, and three. In addition, her report included a third group (Group C) of children who had not been exposed to the kindergarten program in her school system. Children were identified as Group A if they scored 1.3 or higher on the Gates Primary Reading Test in kindergarten. Data on intelligence, person- ality, C.A., M.A., father's education, home background, and presence of older siblings were also collected on each child. Children in Group A tended to have fathers with a higher educational level than did the other children. The difference in achievement between the three groups showed a steady growth differential favoring Group A from grade one through the end of grade three when Group A children scored approximately 1.5 grade levels above either Groups B or C on the Gates Reading Achievement Test. A case study of a five-year-old Negro boy who knew how to read and write upon entering kindergarten was presented by Torrey (387). His mother reported the child had been able to read almost from the time he could talk, but that he had received no help in learning to read. Television was discussed as one possible source for his learning, and it was hypothesized that some adults may have aided him unconsciously. His scores on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests were at the 59th percentile at the time he entered kindergarten and 42nd percentile upon entering first grade. His I.Q. as measured by the WISC was 104, with performance score somewhat higher than the verbal score. On the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, his I.Q. was 111 and he was rated average on the Draw-A-Man test. On the Wide Range Achievement Test, he scored 4.8 in reading and 5.0 in spelling at age six. The author reported that the child's lan-</page><page sequence="111">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 241 guage development (length of utterance of morphemes and gram- matical development) did not appear advanced for his age. The author suggested, among other things, that high verbal ability and high cultural privilege may not be essential in learning to read. McDowell (264) prepared programed reading materials based on Goldilocks and the Three Bears and presented them to his kindergarten subjects in such a manner that correct reading re- sponses were overdetermined. The 22 children participating in the study ranged in Stanford Binet I.Q. from 88 to 143 with a mean of 114. Subjects were divided into three treatment conditions. Group 1 followed a programed series of steps beginning with echoic training followed by intraverbal training, fading tactual stimuli, and fading intraverbal stimuli. The echoic technique presented 70 line drawings sequentially illustrating the story along with a tape recording. Chil- dren were required to repeat the section of the story related to each picture until they had no more than two errors for the complete presentation. Subjects, who participated in ten training sessions per week, received a handful of trinkets at the end of each session. Following establishment of criterion echoic control, intraverbal train- ing concurrent with the presence of tactual and textual stimuli was begun. In this phase, the subject was presented with 5 nouns, 5 adjectives, and 4 verbs printed individually on a picture in the section of the story where the word appeared and was asked to pronounce the word wherever it appeared in the story. Again a criterion for intraverbal control was two errors for each group of words for one complete presentation of the story. In the next two phases tactual stimuli and then intraverbal stimuli were faded. At the end of the latter, only the 14 words were presented in the order in which they appeared in the story and each subject was required to read them with no more than two errors for one complete presentation of the story. Subjects were individually administered seven pre-, mid-, and post-tests covering such factors as word rec- ognition, reading comprehension, reading in a new context, and familiarity with the story. Groups 2 and 3 followed the same pro- cedures except that, for group 2, echoic stimuli were deleted and for group 3, tactual stimuli were deleted. An analysis of variance for groups of unequal size showed that the three groups did not signi- ficantly differ in total number of trials required for completion of the program. Analyses of variance for repeated measures on the same individual were performed on the data for all seven tests for all three groups. In all three groups there was a statistically significant</page><page sequence="112">242 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 improvement among pre-, mid-, and post-test scores on five of the tests. The results indicated that neither the echoic nor the tactual stimuli were essential to learning to read the 14 words. V-4 Reading readiness A number of studies investigating various aspects of instruc- tion as it relates to reading readiness appeared during the year cov- ered by this summary. The topics covered ranged from particular perceptual and motor skills training through the use of teacher aides as adjuncts to a readiness program. Several studies dealt with readiness skills in lower socio-economic children, and one research report surveyed state-wide kindergarten programs. Using a 28-item questionnaire, Swenberg and Dykstra (383) collected information on kindergarten readiness programs in Minne- sota. Respondents replied to questions on whether or not instruction was given in becoming acquainted with the alphabet, developing auditory and visual discrimination, interpreting pictures, developing left to right sequence, and developing sequence in telling a story. Of the 166 teachers replying, 47 reported they made no attempts to teach letter recognition, while 49 reported they taught the alphabet in sequence and less than half indicated that they taught children to write the letters of the alphabet. All respondents used shapes in teaching visual discrimination, but less than half had children note differences among words. Auditory discrimination exercises engaged in by most of the teachers included teaching beginning letter sounds, rhyming, and exercises on like and different sounds. In addi- tion, readiness activities involving 1 to r discrimination, picture read- ing, and development of sequence were utilized by most teachers. The typical kindergarten program included reading readiness activi- ties formerly presented in the first grade. Three investigations of the relationship between socio-eco- nomic status and readiness development appeared. In his research, Hess (176) interviewed twice 160 Negro mothers of four-year-old children from four different social status levels and then tested and observed them during interaction sessions with their children. Social status levels which were represented were college-educated, skilled blue-collar, and unskilled or semi-skilled with and without father present. Two years later, when children were in first grade, the Lee- Clark Reading Readiness Test and the Metropolitan Readiness Tests were administered. In addition, grades in reading at the end of the first semester and second semester of grade one were obtained. Readi-</page><page sequence="113">Summary of reading research WENTRAUB, et al. 243 ness test scores and reading grades were then compared for the various social status levels represented. Coefficients of correlation were computed between the scores and 18 maternal and environ- mental measures falling in the following broad categories: measures of home and community environment, maternal orientation toward the non-family world, maternal control strategies, maternal teach- ing styles, maternal language, and affective behavior of the mother. Middle class Negro children performed at a higher level than did Negro children from other backgrounds. Generally significant and low to moderate correlation coefficients were obtained between the maternal and environmental measures and the measures of reading readiness and achievement. The highest coefficient of correlation obtained, .61, was between the Metropolitan Readiness score and the home resources score, a measure reflecting the use of resources in the home and neighborhood such as reading to the child and the use of toys to stimulate play. The lowest positive coefficient of correlation obtained, .03, was between semester two reading grade and maternal warmth. The author concluded that maternal behavior and cultural background appeared to be influential in affecting the child's early cognitive development and thereby influenced the abili- ties involved in learning to read. Two aspects of a dissertation related to social class differ- ences and reading readiness were published by Miller (276). In one, she presented samples of kindergarten children's daily schedules as obtained from their mothers and noted the differences found among middle class, upper-lower class, and lower-lower class socio- economic levels. Although there was much overlap among the three groups, middle class children were reported as having more inter- action with their parents in general and more opportunity to engage in varied activities. Each child's daily schedule was rated on criteria derived from the literature in the field of child development. Coeffi- cients of correlation were then computed between the ratings and performance on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests (MRT), the Gil- more Oral Reading Test, and four sub-tests of the Stanford Achieve- ment Test (SAT). The latter two tests were administered in late February and early March of grade one. In middle class and upper- lower class children, daily schedules were not found to be significantly correlated with any of these tests. However, in the lower-lower class (N= 17), coefficients of correlation of .57 and .50 were found be- tween daily schedule and performance on MRT and the Gilmore, respectively.</page><page sequence="114">244 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY o Winter 1970 V/2 In the second report, Miller (277) presented a summary of data collected from a structured parent schedule of pre-reading activities. Coefficients of correlation were then computed between home pre-reading activities and performance on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests (MRT), administered in kindergarten, and perform- ance on the Gilmore Oral Reading Test and four sub-tests of the Stanford Achievement Test, administered in late February and early March of first grade. Middle class children had often heard stories or books, had often gone on and discussed family trips, had used manipulative materials, and had dramatized stories read or told to them more frequently than had children in the other two groups. In addition, many of the middle class children could recognize most of the letters of the alphabet and some simple words and had had con- siderable contact with books. Fewer of the upper-lower class children could perform these tasks and many of the lower-lower class children could not. Pre-reading activities and MRT scores correlated .39, .48, and .57 for middle, upper-lower, and lower-lower class children re- spectively. The coefficient of correlation between middle class chil- dren's pre-reading experiences and SAT scores was .54, significant at the .05 level. No statistically significant correlations were found in the two lower groups between home pre-reading experiences and SAT scores. Three reports appeared on readiness programs geared to cul- turally different children in particular. In order to compare the relative effectiveness of the two types of pre-school programs on short and long range language development, Clasen, Spear, and Tomaro (78) randomly assigned thirty Head Start children to one of two treatment conditions. One group received a concentrated language development program including the use of the Peabody Language Development Kit, language games, and other language-oriented acti- vities. Children in the other or control group received only incidental language training as a part of a regular pre-school program. Both groups attended classes three hours daily for eight weeks. Short term assessment of the programs was accomplished by pre- and post-testing children on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales and the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA). Long term effects were assessed by a re-administration of the ITPA to the two Head Start groups and to two additional groups of children and by kindergarten teachers' ratings of each child on a behavior checklist. For short term results, no significant differences in intelligence test scores were found but the language group made significantly greater</page><page sequence="115">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 245 growth on the ITPA than did the incidental group. The long range results, obtained at the end of the kindergarten year, revealed the language group mean on the ITPA total scores was greater than that of the other three groups. On the behavior checklist, the language and incidental language groups were not found to be statistically different. A group of children deemed not to have needed Head Start was rated significantly better than either Head Start group on the behavior measure. Morrison and Harris (282) followed their subjects through the end of grade three and presented achievement data comparing kindergarten and non-kindergarten attendees at the end of grades one, two, and three. Children were taught to read by either a Skills Centered or a Language Experience approach. Within the Skills Centered approach, either a basal reader or a combination basal reader-phonic system was used. The Language Experience (LE) approach followed either a regular LE program or a LE-Audio- Visual program. At the end of grade one, the Stanford Achievement Test was administered to 416 kindergarten and 168 non-kinder- garten children. Fourteen of 21 comparisons were statistically signi- ficant in favor of kindergarten children when raw scores were used. At the end of grade two, the Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT) were given and nine comparisons were significant in favor of the kindergarten children. When the MAT was administered again at the end of grade three to 329 kindergarten children and 114 non- kindergarten subjects, there were only four significant differences. All favored LE kindergarten children over LE non-kindergarten children. Comparisons between approaches revealed a significant dif- ference favoring LE kindergarten children over Skills Centered kindergarten children. Differences for non-kindergarten children were not significant. In order to investigate the effect of parent participation in Head Start on pupil achievement as measured by a readiness test, Willmon (402) divided her pupils into three groups based on amount of parent involvement. Head Start teachers recorded parent participa- tion and involvement in the program. The investigator then char- acterized the parent's role as active, highly active, or no involvement or participation. Readiness achievement was measured by the Metro- politan Readiness Tests given during the first week of grade one. In addition, scores on the Detroit Group Intelligence Test administered during the first week of the Head Start program were collected as well as family data. The analysis of variance technique was used</page><page sequence="116">246 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 to test for the significance of the difference between means of groups. From the results obtained, it appeared that highly active and active parents may have had some positive effect on readiness test scores. Goralski and Kerl (142) pursued a project designed to dis- cover whether teacher aides could be effectively used to aid in a kindergarten reading readiness program. Three groups of three classes each were compared: no teacher aide, one teacher aide, and five teacher aides. At two in-service meetings, an exchange of ideas was held on the effective use of aides. Reading readiness gain was meas- ured by pre- and post-test scores on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests with analysis of covariance used to test the data. Groups with one teacher aide showed the greatest gains on reading readiness and total readiness test scores. The differences of scores between one aide and no aide was significant at the .05 level; the differences in total readiness scores between groups with no aide and those with five aides approached significance at the .05 level in favor of the use of aides. Statistical differences between classes with one aide and those with five aides were not significant. Several studies investigated the effects of perceptual or neurological and motor training programs on readiness performance. In a replication and follow-up of an earlier study, Jacobs, Wirthlin, and Miller (195) attempted to determine the validity of the Frostig tests and the cumulative effects of the Frostig program on reading achievement. In addition, they wished to find out whether children in pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and grade one who took the Frostig program (experimental group) achieved any better than did control children on the Frostig Test of Visual Perception (FTVP) and on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests (MRT). The FTVP and MRT were administered to children in May of kindergarten year, the latter test being given to kindergarten children only. First-grade groups were given the Gates-MacGinite test in May and the Stanford Primary I at the end of grade two. First-grade children were divided into three groups for purposes of analysis: controls and those who had had the Frostig program for one year or for two years. Results of analysis of variance showed that the Frostig program did produce higher scores on the FTVP. With kindergarten pupils a statistically significant difference was observed in favor of experimental pupils on the MRT. For predictive purposes, FTVP scores given in September and May of first grade and MRT scores given at the end of the kindergarten year were correlated with Stanford reading sub-test scores (Word Reading, Paragraph Meaning, and Vocabulary). Of the</page><page sequence="117">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 247 18 correlations reported, only 8 were significantly different from zero, and then only barely significant. The MRT appeared to be a bet- ter predictor for control group pupils than for experimental pupils. Little relationship was found between the Frostig program and read- ing achievement. On the Stanford, scores of control pupils exceeded those of experimentals who had had the Frostig program for one year. However, at grade one level, no significant differences were noted for reading achievement between controls and either experi- mental group (one-year Frostig or two-year Frostig). Beaupre and Kennard (27) reported findings of a pilot study investigating the effectiveness of six different kindergarten programs on the readiness scores of children who evidenced a lack of readiness for formal instruction. Children scoring in the lower third of each participating group on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests (MRT) were given 30-minute twice-a-week sessions for 18 weeks in one of the following six programs and then retested on the MRT: 1] a physical education program designed to foster neurological develop- ment, 2] a motor education program, 3] a physical education pro- gram developed by one of the teachers, 4] a program based on the Frostig materials, 5] a program of counseling, and 6] a regular kindergarten program. The number of pupils involved in each group varied from 6 to 22. Only the Frostig group failed to make a signifi- cant pre- to post-test mean gain. Gains in mean scores from pre- to post-test favored the motor education program group. Stone and Pielstick (377) collected evidence to determine the validity of Delacato's claims that neurological training facilitated readiness for reading. Children in one kindergarten classroom were randomly assigned by sex to experimental and control groups. The experimental group was given 18 weeks of daily half hour sessions following the cross pattern creeping, cross pattern walking, and sleep pattern procedures prescribed by Delacato. In addition, parents were given instruction and information on the procedures in order to continue training on weekends. Control pupils were given a 30- minute game and activities session for the 18 weeks, and parents were requested to give 30 minutes of attention to some activity on Saturdays and Sundays also. Subjects were pre- and post-tested on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), the Lee-Clark Reading Readiness Test, and the Frostig Test of Visual Perception. Pre-test scores were used as covariates in an analysis of covariance treatment with data from each set of tests treated separately. Post-test means on the PPVT and the Lee-Clark did not differ significantly, but there</page><page sequence="118">248 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 was a significant difference favoring the experimental group on the Frostig test. The authors concluded that there was little support for the notion that neurological training benefits reading readiness at the kindergarten level. Faustman (124) investigated the effects of selected kinder- garten lessons in perception upon first-grade reading achievement. In September of the kindergarten year, classes were tested with the Winter Haven Perception Ability Forms Test (PAFT) and the Good- enough-Harris Drawing Test and randomly assigned to either a con- trol or an experimental condition. Teachers were then randomly assigned to control or experimental classes after having been matched on years of experience and teaching competence. All teachers were given in-service aid in the use of new kindergarten guides and in developing language skills. In addition, experimental teachers re- ceived aid in teaching perception skills. When the PAFT was re- administered in May, a chi square test of significance showed no significant difference in growth between the two groups. However, when the Gates Primary Word Recognition Test, administered in November and May of grade one, was scored, findings at both testings favored the experimental group (.01 level). In their study on the effect of using a science program on change in readiness scores, Ayers and Mason (21) used subjects in two kindergarten classrooms. All kindergarten classes stressed readi- ness for first grade and met three hours per day, five days a week for the school year. The experimental group received approximately one hour per week of instruction for 22 weeks with Part A of Science, A Process Approach. The control group spent the one hour a week in their normal program. In October and May, alternate forms of the Metropolitan Readiness Tests (MRT) were administered as pre- and post-test measures of readiness. A t test was used to test for signifi- cant differences between pre- and post-test means of each MRT sub- test for both groups, and between mean gain scores of the two tests. Both groups made a significant overall gain in total test scores. In addition, there was a significant difference in favor of the experi- mental group on the Listening, Numbers, and Copying sub-tests of the MRT and on the total test score. The difference on the Word Meaning sub-test of the MRT favored the control group (.01 level). In analyzing the effectiveness of two types of readiness pro- grams, French (132) compared achievement on readiness and read- ing tests. Her subjects were divided into four treatment groups, two</page><page sequence="119">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 249 kindergarten and two first grade. Control groups received unstruc- tured kindergarten training and a conventional first-grade program. Experimental groups at kindergarten level received highly struc- tured, "rigorous, academic readiness training." The first-grade group received the rigorous training in both kindergarten and grade one. Both kindergarten treatments were taught by the same teachers in dif- ferent years. Data on first-grade groups were collected from different years, also. For kindergarten and grade one, the Metropolitan Readi- ness Tests (MRT) and the Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT) respectively were taken as criterion measures of achievement. Total raw scores on the MRT and grade expectancy scores on the MAT were used. No statistically significant differences were noted for either readiness scores or MAT scores of the two groups. In both kinder- garten programs, older children surpassed younger children on readi- ness test scores. L. A. Harris (164) identified words of high interest to boys and words of high interest to girls and presented them to kinder- garten children in order to study the effect of interest on initial acqui- sition of words. A six-step procedure was followed to select the four pairs of interest-loaded words. On the basis of the Goodenough- Harris Drawing Test, administered prior to the experimental sessions, subjects were divided by sex into high and low ability groups. Within each sex, subjects were assigned to groups by ability and taught either boy-words or girl-words by telling a child a word and asking him to repeat it. The child was then asked to identify the words and a tally was kept. Subjects followed this teaching-testing cycle until each word had been correctly identified on two successive trials or until 15 testing cycles had been completed. Retention was tested 24 hours later and scores analyzed by a chi square procedure. Although differences in learning the words favored the interest-loaded words, both boys and girls learned either type of words equally well. Reten- tion was found to be independent of sex, word type, and ability of subjects. Caldwell and Hall (64) randomly assigned their kinder- garten subjects to one of three groups, 1] orientation relevant, 2] orientation irrelevant, and 3] control, in order to note the effect of teaching the concepts of same and different on children's ability to discriminate among the letters b, d, p, and q. All groups were given pre-training in which they were asked to line up a figure on a plastic overlay over another figure. Group 1 was told not to turn the overlay</page><page sequence="120">250 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 around or over when trying to line up the figure. Group 2 was en- couraged to turn the overlay in all directions and were told that the figures were the same if they could be lined up in any way. Group 3 was given no information relative to turning the overlay but used figures having 25 per cent size differential. In the letter matching task, pupils were presented with a standard and asked to match to the standard from a series of letters and forms including rotations and reversals. Results were analyzed in terms of the percentage of correct responses for each subject on all letters. An analysis of covariance and a Scheffe test for multiple comparisons were per- formed on the data. The results showed that Group 1 performed significantly better (.01) than Group 3 and Group 3 performed significantly better (.01) than Group 2. The authors interpreted their findings and those of previous research as suggesting the need for 1] a more adequate analysis of the task to be performed, and 2] the implementation of concept learning as a prerequisite step in the learning procedure. Preliminary information collected during the first two years of a longitudinal study attempting to provide compensatory experi- ences in the pre-school years of culturally different children was reported by McConnell, Horton, and Smith (260). Children in the study were from two community day care centers located in the lowest socio-economic areas of a large city and ranged in age from 2 years 8 months to 5 years 11 months. Control groups were established in two similar day care centers. Children met in groups of 6 or 7 for five days a week on a half-day basis for language development and sensory-perceptual training. Assessment of the program included instruments administered to evaluate language, intelligence, memory and attention, and visual-perceptual motor capacity. Experimental groups showed a statistically significant gain in scores on the Stan- ford-Binet while the control groups showed no gain on this test. Both groups showed some gains on Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores, although the experimental groups showed less growth on this test than they had on the Stanford-Binet. Experimental groups made statistically significant gains on 4 of the 5 sub-tests on the Frostig Test of Visual Perception while the control group gained significantly on only one of the sub-tests. A small sub-group of experi- mental and control children were tested on the Illinois Test of Psy- cholinguistic Abilities (ITPA). Children were found to be superior in visual capacities over auditory capacities on the decoding sub-tests.</page><page sequence="121">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 251 After nine months of instruction, the experimental group gained 15 months in language age on the ITPA while the control group showed a 2 month gain. The Metropolitan Readiness Tests were administered in the second year of the project to those children preparing to enter grade one in the fall. Experimental pupils scored in the average range, but control pupils had a median total score which placed them in the lowest 6 per cent of children entering grade one. V-5 Teaching reading-primary grades Following the pattern of previous years, a number of investi- gations continued to appear at the primary levels. The number re- ported this year, however, is not as great as in previous summaries, reflecting, perhaps, the decrease in U. S. Office of Education funds available. Two studies focused on disadvantaged children in particular. Elkind and Deblinger (112) researched the problem of whether or not training in perceptual activity had any effect on improvement of skill in reading. Two groups of second-grade children were matched on the basis of perceptual activity and for reading achievement as measured by the Picture Ambiguity Test (PAT), the Picture Integra- tion Test (PIT), and the California Achievement Tests. Experimental and control groups met in training sessions for three half-hour peri- ods a week for fifteen weeks. Control children worked with the Bank Street Readers while experimental groups had nonverbal exer- cises designed to train perceptual skills. Mean differences between the pre- and post-test measures on the three instruments were subjected to a t test analysis for significance. The experimental group had a significantly higher mean score (.05 level) on the PIT, and on the Word Recognition and Word Form sub-tests of the California. In a preliminary progress report, Holmes and Rose (181) studied the effectiveness of beginning reading instruction in i.t.a. for disadvantaged children. Children were placed by stratified random sampling procedures into either an i.t.a. or a t.o. class. Comparison of scores on the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Tests and the Lee-Clark Reading Readiness Test showed the two groups to be equal. In January of grade one, the Lee-Clark Reading Primer Test was ad- ministered and the Stanford Achievement Test was given at the end of May. Little difference was noted between scores of the two groups in January. However, in May a t test performed without correcting for pre-test scores indicated the difference between mean scores</page><page sequence="122">252 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 was significant (.01 level) in favor of the i.t.a. group. The authors noted that children who lacked readiness for any formal reading program were aided only slightly by i.t.a. In a study designed to determine if children could learn to read more efficiently when the reading of music was taught con- currently with regular reading instruction, Movsesian (286) fol- lowed his experimental and control groups for seven months. Both groups had a music program, but the experimental group spent a portion of their time in a music reading program that stressed left to right orientation, and the development of spatial-perceptual rela- tionships. Criterion measures administered were the reading sections of the California Achievement Tests (CAT), the Gray Oral Reading Test, and the Survey of Primary Music Reading Development, a test devised by the researcher. The t test was used to determine the signi- ficance of the gains between the pre- and post-test means. In grades one and two, experimental groups showed significant gains on the CAT and Music Reading tests but not on the Gray Oral. In grade three, the experimental group made significant gains on the Gray Oral and Music Reading tests but not on the CAT. Experimental groups in all three grades made greater gains than did the control groups on all three tests, with significant differences (.001) in read- ing comprehension in grade one and in both vocabulary and compre- hension at grade two (.01). To test the effect on reading growth of a perceptual-motor program, McCormick, Schnobrich, and Footlik (261) randomly as- signed grade one pupils to either a perceptual-motor activities group or a control group. Teachers and volunteer mothers were instructed in training procedures for the experimental program. Children met in groups of five for two hours a week over a nine-week period. Exer- cises included cross-lateral crawling, walking, balancing, hopping, skipping, and jumping rope. The Pintner-Cunningham Primary Test was administered to obtain a measure of I.Q. and test, re-test scores on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT) were used to assess growth in reading. No significant differences were obtained for the total first-grade groups. However, when means and standard devia- tions were compared for children who scored in the lowest third of the original MAT administration, the gains exhibited by the experi- mental group were statistically significant (.01 level). Bateman (26) compared auditory and visual approaches to beginning reading when children were grouped by preferred learning modality and when they were not. In their kindergarten year, children</page><page sequence="123">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 253 in eight classes were given the Detroit Group Intelligence Scale and the Metropolitan Readiness Tests. The Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA) was administered to children in four of the eight classrooms. Assignment to first grade was made on the basis of test results with non-ITPA classes designated as non-placement classes. In two of the non-placement classrooms, an auditory method of reading instruction was emphasized while a visual method was em- ployed in the other two. In the other four classrooms, called place- ment classes, children were labelled either auditory or visual on the basis of performance on the two ITPA sub-tests measuring automatic- sequential language abilities. One class was then taught to its strength and one to its weakness in each modality. The criterion measures used to evaluate growth in reading at the end of grade one included the mean scores on the Gates Primary Word Recogni- tion and Paragraph Reading sub-tests and an author-constructed spelling test. When auditory and visual methods were compared for non-placement classes, the mean reading achievement of the chil- dren experiencing the auditory method was three and one third months higher than that of the visual classes, a difference significant at the .05 level. For the placement classes, also, analysis of variance showed that the auditory subjects were significantly superior (.01 level) to the visual subjects. There was no interaction between pre- ferred modality and the method of instruction used. The author felt the data suggested that auditory learners should be taught to their strength and visual learners to their weakness. Two studies, other than those supported by the U. S. Office of Education, reported on programs comparing a heavy phonics orientation with more conventional programs. Three first-grade read- ing series were analyzed for their relative effectiveness by Potts and Savino (310). Two of the series emphasized sound-symbol relation- ships; the third, a whole word approach. A random sample of fifty children was drawn from the group using each reading series. In September of grade one, the New York State Readiness Test was administered and scores were later used as the adjusting variable in an analysis of covariance. In May, reading achievement was assessed through the Gates Primary Reading Test, the Gates Advanced Primary Reading Tests, and three sub-sections of the Stanford Achievement Test, Battery I and Battery II. Coefficients of correlation between the readiness test and the Gates Primary and Battery I of the Stanford were .679 and .689 respectively. Differences significant beyond the .01 level were found among all three programs. The most</page><page sequence="124">254 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY a Winter 1970 V/2 effective program was the one incorporating the most intensive phonics training; the program emphasizing whole word reading was found to be least effective. In a follow-up of his dissertation, Dodds (98) reported achievement scores of his experimental (Words in Color) and control (basal series) pupils at the end of grade three. Both groups had been introduced to reading in the kindergarten and were taught by the same three teachers in consecutive years. Factors considered in com- paring the two groups included C.A., readiness and intelligence test scores, and school attendance. The grade three reading program for experimental subjects was described as "highly personalized"; control pupils continued to follow a basal program. Criterion measures at the end of grade three were the vocabulary, comprehension, and total reading scores on the California Elementary Reading Test and the spelling score on the California Elementary Spelling Test. A two- tailed t test was used to measure differences between the two groups. Although mean differences favored the experimental group in every comparison, no statistically significant results were obtained. Shapiro and Willford (349) reported findings from a longi- tudinal study assessing the relative spelling and reading achievement of a group beginning formal reading instruction in kindergarten with a group beginning in grade one. Both groups were introduced to reading with i.t.a. and both used the same materials. Appropriate forms of the Stanford Achievement Test batteries were admin- istered at grade placements 1.5, 1.8, and 2.8. The first testing was given in i.t.a. while later achievement was measured with the t.o. form of the Stanford. Analysis of covariance was used to adjust for differences in intelligence, teacher experience, and time allotted to language arts activities. At all three testings, the kindergarten group out-performed the later starting group with all differences significant at the .05 level with the exception of vocabulary on the second testing. The purpose of Neville's study (288) was to investigate the effect on word recognition, comprehension, fluency, and vocalization of practicing an oral response or an echoic response before silent reading. In addition, the effects of the two responses at two different learning aptitude levels and for each sex were compared. Based on scores from the Pintner-Cunningham Primary General Ability Test and sections from two readiness tests, two equal sized groups were formed, one composed of children scoring above the composite median score, and the other, children scoring below it. For each of these two learning levels, subjects were randomly assigned to one of</page><page sequence="125">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 255 three treatments by sex and teachers were randomly assigned to one of two classes at each level. Children were then taught the entire pre-primer vocabulary by a sight word, isolated approach. Reading in the pre-primers was taught for ten consecutive school days using one of three treatments: silent (no oral response prior to silent reading); oral (oral response before silent reading); and echoic (echoic response prior to silent reading). Subjects were tested at the end of each of the three pre-primers on an experimenter-constructed test using all the words of a particular pre-primer plus words from earlier pre-primers and several new words. Subjects read the con- structed story test first silently and then orally into an apparatus containing a concealed, sensitive microphone. A literal, inference, and total comprehension score was then obtained on each subject. In addition, the number of vocalized words was totaled for each child. Oral reading was rated for fluency. Both word-recognition error score and a word-identification (new words) score were ob- tained. Eight weeks after the end of the experiment, subjects were post-tested on comprehension, word identification, and word recog- nition. The Primary Reading Profiles, Level 1, was also administered at that time. An analysis of variance technique revealed that echoic groups read more fluently and that echoic and oral training reduced vocalization. No statistically significant differences were found for word recognition, word identification, or comprehension. Several U. S. Office of Education Cooperative Research Pro- gram studies were carried over into third grade. In addition, reports of various aspects of the total data appeared. Dykstra (108) examined the data at the end of grades one and two to determine the effective- ness of code-emphasis versus meaning-emphasis programs. Programs were categorized as conventional basal, linguistic, or phonics-first basal and analyzed on the basis of a number of instructional variables including vocabulary load, phonic load, and type of vocabulary con- trol. Comparisons were then made between conventional basal and phonics-first groups. Criterion measures of reading achievement were the Stanford Achievement Test, the Gilmore Oral Reading Test, the Gates-McKillop Reading Diagnostic Test, and the Fry Phonetically- Regular Word List. Linguistic groups were better in oral word pro- nunciation and silent reading word recognition at the end of both grades one and two. Silent reading comprehension and accuracy of oral reading favored the basal pupils over the linguistic children. All performance measures between conventional basal and phonics- first groups favored the latter at both testing points. The author noted</page><page sequence="126">256 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 that there is no clear cut evidence that the early code emphasis is the major reason for the relative effectiveness of that program. Dykstra (109) also summarized the findings of the second- grade phase of the Cooperative Research Program under three main headings: 1] the relationship between various readiness character- istics and reading and spelling achievement; 2] the effectiveness of i.t.a., linguistic, language-experience, and phonic/linguistic programs when compared with conventional basal programs at the end of grade two; and 3] the relative influence of the project and of the method and/or materials on reading achievement. The Word Meaning, Para- graph Meaning, Spelling, Word Study Skills, and Language sub-tests of the Stanford Achievement Test, Primary Battery II were used to assess achievement at the end of grade two. In addition, a sample of pupils in each project was given the Gilmore Oral Reading Test, the Fry Test of Phonetically-Regular Words, and the Gates Word List. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were computed between performance scores on readiness measures obtained at the beginning of first grade and measures of second-grade achievement, as well as between achievement in grades one and two. The pre-read- ing abilities most highly related to second-grade reading achievement were knowledge of letter names, intelligence, and auditory dis- crimination. Linguistic, phonic/linguistic, and i.t.a. programs were found to be generally superior to conventional basal programs in word recognition and spelling at the end of grade two. In paragraph comprehension, no consistent pattern in the relative effectiveness of programs was found. The project itself appeared to have a greater influence on reading achievement than did the particular instruc- tional method or materials employed. The author noted that all pro- grams used in one project were found to be similar in effectiveness. He suggested that the entire instructional setting was involved in the effectiveness of a program rather than the method or materials alone. Fry (134) presented the results of a comparison of i.t.a., Diacritical Marking System (DMS), and t.o. at the end of three years when 299 children remained in the study. Silent reading was meas- ured by the sub-test scores on the Stanford Achievement Test while oral reading was measured on a randomly selected sub-sample using the Gilmore Oral Reading Test. No significant differences were noted for silent reading, spelling, or oral reading. A three-way analysis of variance was used to determine whether any method was superior for boys or girls, or for bright or dull children. No significant differ- ences were found, although girls read significantly better than boys.</page><page sequence="127">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 257 All variables were intercorrelated at the end of each year, but only correlations with the Paragraph Meaning sub-test of the SAT were reported. The raw score on the Pintner-Cunningham I.Q. test, administered at the beginning of grade one, correlated .81, .53, and .41 with Paragraph Meaning scores at the end of grades one, two, and three, respectively. Paragraph Meaning sub-test scores correlated .77 at end of first grade and .85 at the end of second grade with grade three results. Schneyer (346) compared two approaches to beginning read- ing instruction, a basal and a linguistic. Pupils were transferred into a basal series as they completed the readers and materials of the linguistics program. The Word Meaning, Paragraph Meaning, Spelling, and Word Study Skills sub-tests of the Stanford Achieve- ment Test (SAT), Primary II Battery and the Intermediate I Battery were used as criterion measures of achievement at the end of grade three. Sub-test raw scores from the two batteries were added together and the combined sub-test scores were used in all computations. A random sub-sample of children in each treatment group was also given the Gilmore Oral Reading Test and the Gates Word Pronunci- ation Test. An analysis of covariance was used to analyze data with intelligence and various readiness factors used as covariates. The only statistically significant difference between treatments on the SAT was on the Word Study Skills sub-test. Results favored the basal reader group at the .05 level of significance. Pupils in the linguistics treatment group scored significantly better (.05 level) on the rate score of the Gilmore. The author concluded that when the treatment groups are considered as a whole, neither approach was more effective. Sheldon, Stinson, and Peebles (353) identified disabled read- ers through a longitudinal study of a total third-grade population and compared disabled and normal readers on C.A., M.A. (Pintner- Cunningham), and five readiness factors. Disabled readers were defined as those scoring .5 of a year below grade level on the Word Meaning, Paragraph Meaning, and Word Study Skills sub-tests of the Stanford Achievement Test administered at the beginning of grade three. Although no significant differences were noted between disabled and normal readers on C.A., disabled readers were signifi- cantly inferior in M.A. and on all readiness measures. When scores of disabled readers were analyzed by sex, no significant differences were found. A randomly selected group of 53 disabled readers were admin- istered a battery of seven diagnostic tests including visual and audi-</page><page sequence="128">258 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 tory screening, the Gilmore Oral Reading Test, the Spache Diagnostic Reading Scales, Word Recognition sub-test, the Wepman Auditory Discrimination Test, the Betts Ready to Read battery, and an informal test developed at Syracuse University. Seventeen per cent of the girls were word-by-word readers compared with 75 per cent of the boys, girls were found to be superior to boys in accuracy and comprehen- sion, and of the 34 per cent of the total sample who failed the Wepman, boys outnumbered girls two to one. Interviews with and observations of classroom teachers pointed to the fact that a variety of grouping plans and reading services were being used to aid the disabled readers. Findings of a three-year longitudinal study of four different approaches to reading instruction were reported by Hayes and Wuest (169). The four programs were a basal reader program (BR), a combination basal plus phonics (BRP), a phonics approach (P), and an i.t.a. program. Children were originally randomly selected and assigned to classrooms and treatment groups. There were 262 pupils remaining at the end of grade three for whom all data were available; an analysis was run on 180 pupil scores. Included in the information obtained and the procedures used were the following: administrative visits to classrooms to check on adherence to pro- cedures and materials, teacher logs, consultant workshops and class- room visitations, and teacher-rating sheets. Criterion measures in- cluded scores on the Paragraph Meaning, Word Meaning, Word Study Skills, and Spelling sub-tests of the Stanford Achievement Test, records of the number of books read independently, and individual oral reading tests administered to randomly selected samples. In June of grade three, significant differences were found for the phonics approach over the BR and BRP approaches in Paragraph Meaning, Spelling, and Word Meaning. The BR approach was behind the other three in Word Study Skills. No significant differences were noted for attitude. The phonics and BR groups were significantly ahead of the other two groups on the number of books read per month in grade three. The authors concluded that methods and materials as well as teachers make a difference in the teaching of reading. The focus of Hammill and Mattleman's (156) study was on an evaluation of the effectiveness of programed materials when used alone or when used in conjunction with a basal program in grades two and three. Both programed approaches were compared with a control group that used a basal program only. The three groups</page><page sequence="129">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 259 were matched on achievement as measured by the Stanford Achieve- ment Test at grade two and on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills at grade three. Post-test data on the same instruments were collected. Differences among treatment groups did not approach significance. In England, Milne and Fyfe (279) used random allocation of pupils to classes, teachers to schools, and approaches to classes in their attempt to control the teacher variable aspect of their study. Three teachers per school were selected from among those identified as similar in their approach to teaching reading and were randomly assigned to t.o., i.t.a., or a programed reading kit, all using the same basal reader. Briefing meetings, a series of common lectures, and regular visits to each classroom were included as part of the study design. From the classrooms available, a sub-sample of 29 children in each of the three groups was formed. Children were matched on sex, socio-economic background, vocabulary grade, I.Q., and school. Measures were taken on 19 dependent variables, including the Burt- Vernon Word Recognition Test, the NS 45 Group Reading Test, and spelling and writing measures. No significant differences were found among the approaches to reading, but some schools were significantly superior to others. The authors reasoned that since they were dealing with matched groups and since no significant interaction effects were noted, the problem of the teacher variable had been success- fully handled. Cartwright and Jones (69) reported results during the sec- ond 18-month period of an i.t.a. study in England. In this study, two classrooms were established in each of 16 schools, one i.t.a. and one t.o. Pupils were randomly assigned to them by age and sex groupings. An attempt to control the teacher variable was instituted by having the same teacher instruct reading in both classes with time, materials, and methods controlled. Several schools were dropped from the study as a result of lack of control of teacher-shared time. In the final analysis, data from nine schools meeting the criteria established for sharing teacher time were used. At various intervals, the following tests were administered: Schonell's Graded Word Read- ing Test, Neale Analysis of Reading Ability, the NS 45 Silent Reading Comprehension Test, and Schonell's Spelling Test. Early testings were given to i.t.a. groups in transliterated versions; all later testing were given to both groups in t.o. When the experimental group was tested with transliterated versions of the tests, its performance tended to be superior to the control group. When, however, both groups began to be tested in t.o., the experimental group lost its lead and results</page><page sequence="130">260 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 generally favored the control group. A comparison of the scores of the top third in performance in each group showed no significant differences between groups on any of the measures. The authors pointed to the large variability in results between schools. Compari- sons with the first i.t.a. experiment in England were also drawn and an attempt was made to explain some of the differences. Although the study in critical reading by Wolf, King, and Huck (410) covered grades one through six rather than the primary grades only, it has been placed in this section. Three major problems were investigated in this study: 1] the feasibility of instructing ele- mentary school children in critical reading skills while maintaining progress in basic skills; 2] the relationship between such factors as intelligence, sex, personality, and general reading ability and the ability to read critically; and 3] the kinds of teacher verbal behavior that elicited critical responses from pupils. Preliminary steps in the investigation included the construction and verification of an opera- tional definition of critical reading, the development of materials, teaching procedures, and tests, and the training of teachers in instruc- tional techniques. Four classrooms at each grade level, two experi- mental and two control, participated in the study. Teachers were chosen from among volunteers who had attended workshop sessions. Experimental teachers taught critical reading skills; control teachers emphasized instruction in children's literature. Pre- and post-tests were administered at the beginning and end of the school year in critical reading and also in general reading ability, as measured by the California Achievement Tests in Reading. Additionally, the Lorge- Thorndike Intelligence Tests and the California Test of Personality were given. Data from six observations made at regular intervals in each classroom were also analyzed to obtain information on types of teacher questions and on pupil responses. The findings are too de- tailed to be more than highlighted here. The reader is referred to the full report for more complete information on findings. An analysis of covariance treatment showed that the total score of the experimental classes on the critical reading test was better than that of the control classes. Experimental children also tended to perform as well as control children on the California Intelligence; generally, reading ability was found to be related to critical reading ability. Control teachers tended to emphasize questions classified as Specific Facts, Interpreting, and Applying, while experimental teachers asked more Clarifying, Analyzing, and Evaluating types of questions. Level of pupil responses was found to change in the direction of higher levels</page><page sequence="131">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 261 of thinking during the time of the study. Interpreting, analyzing, and evaluating questions produced more critical responses from children than did other types of questions. V-6 Teaching reading-grades four to eight The topics investigated by researchers working with inter- mediate grade children included two reports on rates of reading as well as several studies dealing with summer gains or losses, and the effect of summer developmental reading programs. Otto, Barrett, and Harris (299) presented an extensive re- port of a U. S. Office supported study investigating whether teaching children to read for the main idea under explicitly stated or implicit conditions produced better results in rate variability, and its transfer and retention. At each of grades four, five, and six, 12 boys and 12 girls were randomly selected from among those children who scored between the fortieth and ninetieth percentiles on a reading achieve- ment test. Two groups were formed, one working with materials in which a main idea was explicitly stated (Group 1) and one in which the stated main idea had been deleted from the materials (Group 2). In both, the task was to identify the main idea from a list of sentences. In addition, both orientation and training materials included reading for a sequence of events and for specific details with comprehension again checked by means of identification statements. The first three days of a ten-day instructional period were devoted to orientation. Pupils read daily for three purposes under supervision of trained examiners. On the other seven days, each subject read six selections daily, predicted his rate for each selection, and evaluated his own progress by graphing his rates for the different purposes. On the eleventh day, children were tested on four 66-word randomly ordered selections on each of the three purposes. Testing for immediate and delayed transfer (one month later) was done with 198-word passages taken from the Reader's Digest Skill Builders. The analysis design and findings are too detailed to report here. Only highlights can be given and the readers is referred to the original source for more in- formation. Subjects consistently varied their rate when reading either narrative or expository material for three different purposes. Children read most rapidly to find specific details and most slowly for sequence. Some interaction of style with purpose was noted. Ex- pository materials were read most rapidly for main idea, while narra- tive materials were read most rapidly for sequence and for specific facts. Children taught with passages containing explicitly stated main</page><page sequence="132">262- READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 ideas did not differ in rate variability from children who had learned with materials in which the main ideas were implicit. Different types of training materials appeared to have little effect on the transfer or transfer retention tasks. Although sex did not make a difference in rate variability, there was a difference noted by grade level when reading expository materials. In a pilot study, Schale (344) used subjects who scored at grade level or better on the California Reading Test to work on rate development. A method called Reinforced Reading combined with sixteen 0. Henry-type stories was used. Pupils began with third-grade level materials and the Shadowscope and reading pacers. More diffi- cult materials were gradually introduced to be used in school and in the home. Subjects met for a 50-minute period once a week for five weeks. Mean reading rate went from 157 words per minute on the pre-test to 622 words per minute on the post-test. There was a small drop in comprehension. The author concluded that more work in improving rates of reading at the intermediate levels needs to be done. Kasdon (207) attempted to find out what differences oc- curred in instructional level, oral reading rate, and number of errors made when a student read silently before reading orally or when he read orally-at-sight. A 7 per cent random sample of pupils was drawn from eight schools in one school system. Pupils were asked to read equivalent selections from the Spache Diagnostic Reading Scales and to answer comprehension questions on them. Each pupil alternated the conditions of his reading and conditions were reversed for alternate pupils. The orally-at-sight average instructional level was 5.5; under the silent-oral condition, it was 6.0. The difference between the two was significant at the .01 level. In no instance was the oral-sight instructional level higher than the silent-oral. The differ- ence between the two groups in speed of oral reading at instructional level was not statistically significant. However, when speed of oral reading on equivalent selections was compared, the difference was significant in favor of the silent-oral condition. The difference be- tween number of errors was not significant statistically between the two conditions at instructional level. When, however, pupils read a selection at the orally-at-sight instructional level under silent-oral conditions, significantly fewer errors were made under the latter conditions. The primary focus of Rodgers' research (328) was to isolate, study, and describe how the use of different kinds of questions tended to influence the variety of sources, answers, and processes employed</page><page sequence="133">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 263 by students to locate and select answers. His sample was composed of disadvantaged sixth-grade pupils whose mean score on the Cali- fornia Test of Mental Maturity was 89.43 and who had a mean achievement of 5.1 on the California Achievement Tests administered early in the school year. In addition, the sample included juniors and seniors in elementary education, none of whom had less than a "C+" cumulative grade point average. Eighteen questions were devel- oped from 15 source materials selected from the elementary school library in which the sixth grade was located. Subjects, presented with the questions were asked to do four things: 1] write the correct re- sponse or responses; 2] list the steps used in finding the answers; 3] list the source materials used; and 4] record the time required to locate the answers. In every instance, college subjects used a greater number of sources than did the elementary pupils. In all but one instance, college subjects showed a greater tendency to use the same sources as the researcher in obtaining answers. When data were analyzed on the sequence of steps used by college students to locate answers, it was found that they tended to use a general reference source as the first step in locating answers. In only one question, did as many as half the students consult the index area of the library as a first procedural step. The author reported that both groups showed a tendency to select answers that differed from the teacher's when a single source was used by the latter. Data also suggested that there was a greater chance that students would come up with answers differing from that expected by the teacher when the expec- ted answers for related questions were selected from more than one source. When questions were carefully programed and dealt with a single fact, subjects were more likely to give the expected re- sponses. The author stated that if specific answers to related ques- tions were expected, the teacher would need to carefully program his questions and specify sources to be used. Soar and Soar (366) conducted a two-year longitudinal in- vestigation into three related areas: 1] a comparison of summer growth with school-year growth; 2] the relationship of pupil summer academic growth to teacher-pupil classroom behavior; and 3] the search for any differences in tendency to show growth during the school year as opposed to growth during the summer. Pupils were tested in the fall and spring of fifth and sixth grade on the Vocabu- lary, Reading, and Arithmetic sub-tests of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills. In addition, during the fifth-grade year, teacher-pupil behavior was observed using two observation schedules: Flanders' Interaction</page><page sequence="134">264 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 Analysis and a second schedule composed of original items and sel- ected items from two other instruments. The difference score between observed and predicted true gain was used as the measure for analysis. Classroom observations gave 49 measures which were re- duced by factor analysis. Two factors were selected-a measure of the extent of teacher control and a measure of emotional climate. For the part of the study concerned with the relation between teacher behavior and pupils' summer growth, classrooms representative of the extremes of the dimensions of the two factors were identified and residual true gain measures from pupils in these classrooms were analyzed by an analysis of variance technique. In general, the growth for vocabulary was approximately 8 months for the first year, 4 months for the summer, and 72 months for the second year. For reading, the same periods showed a growth of 61/2, 32, and almost 7 months. For vocabulary, differences in emotional climate produced no statistically significant differences in growth over the summer. However, the children in direct control classrooms grew less than did pupils in indirect control classrooms. For reading, emotional climate, control, and interaction were all non-significant for the summer. During the year, indirect teacher control produced more growth in reading than did teacher control. The author concluded that important amounts of academic growth can occur outside the class- room and that the nature of the previous year's classroom can affect the amount of summer growth. There were also indications of pupil differences in tendency to grow more during the school year as opposed to the summer. Cramer and Dorsey (87) studied the effect of a five-week summer developmental reading program on the reading achievement of rural pupils in grades four through eight. In May, the California Reading Test (CRT) and the California Test of Mental Maturity (CTMM) were administered and reading potential was established for all possible enrollees in the summer program. Staff members were given twenty hours of in-service work prior to the start of the summer session. Pupils met in groups of no more than 15 children for three hours daily, five days a week for the entire five weeks. Instruction was individualized on a daily basis with each child made responsible for his own assignments. The program was evaluated by means of an alternate form of the CRT and questionnaires sent to parents and pu- pils. Pupils' attitudes toward school, reading, and self were reported as having improved markedly although no data were presented. Children</page><page sequence="135">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 265 at each grade level showed gains in reading when pre- and post-test scores were compared. Attendance was reported as being 97 per cent. V-7 Teaching reading-high school At the high school levels most of the research reports cent- ered on the evaluation of developmental reading programs of various sorts. Fader and McNeil (120) described in detail and evaluated a program designed to develop an interest in reading among reluctant male readers from low socio-economic backgrounds. Two popula- tions, both in training schools, were identified as control and experi- mental groups. The experimental group was exposed to English in Every Classroom, a program based on the principles of saturation and diffusion in which newspapers, magazines, and paperback books were placed in classrooms in lieu of customary texts and newspapers. In addition to WISC scores on most boys, pre- and post-measures on the Language, Word Meaning, Paragraph Meaning, and Spelling sub-tests of the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) were collected on a number of subjects. Additional data consisted of both teacher-rated measures of behavior and adjustment; pupil-rated measures of vari- ous attitudes and behaviors; and a test measuring written verbal proficiency. Measures of self-esteem showed a rise in the experimental group and a drop in the control group. Boys in the experimental group were superior to boys in the control group on the paragraph comprehension section of the SAT at the beginning of the study. Both groups improved in this skill, but experimental students made twice the progress of students in the control group. Both high and low achievers in the experimental group showed positive gains on the SAT during the course of the study. Other data, too numerous to report here, were presented. An evaluation study at the end of the second year of a reading program designed for high school freshmen was undertaken by McDonald and Nacke (263). All entering ninth-grade students were given the Davis Reading Test and assigned to one of four levels of instruction based on the results: 1] accelerated; 2] developmental; 3] corrective; or 4] clinical. A more individualized diagnosis, given in each group, included the Gray Oral Reading Paragraphs, Durrell Analysis of Reading Difficulty, and various informal reading inven- tories. Data on the Davis test were collected at mid-year and at the end of the second semester and gains were studied for significance. In the first year of the program, statistically significant gains were</page><page sequence="136">266 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 made in the first semester but not in the second semester. In the second year, groups showed significant mean gains both semesters. In both years the gains made from September to January were great- er than those made from January to May. The purposes of a study by Miller and Sawyer (275) were twofold: 1] to evaluate the effectiveness of two developmental read- ing courses, an elective one for seniors and a required one for all new freshmen; and 2] to determine what selective criteria might be valuable in identifying students for the programs. Pre- and post- test scores on reading rate, reading comprehension, and reading efficiency were collected for both groups. In addition, data from the Otis Quick Scoring Test of Mental Ability, nine sub-scores of the Differential Aptitude Test, and sub-test and total scores from the Ohio State University Psychological Examination were used. When pre- and post-test mean reading test scores for seniors were compared, they showed significant improvement in rate and efficiency with an insignificant change in comprehension. For freshmen, all differences between pre-and post-test means were significant but the change in comprehension was in the negative direction. When freshmen reading scores were analyzed by high and low quartile groups on the Otis, it was noted that there were no significant differences between the means of the two groups on the pre-test, but that all three scores were significantly different between groups on the post-test. Further analysis revealed that the high quartile group made significant im- provements in rate with no significant loss in comprehension. The significant loss in comprehension among freshmen was a feature of the low quartile group. The authors stated that they were unable to identify any practical criteria from their study to aid in identifying students who would be successful in a developmental reading program. Haslam and Brown (168) examined the assumption that improved study habits and greater academic achievement would re- sult from instruction in study skills. Experimental students, selected from among those indicating a desire to pursue their education be- yond the high school level, were given nine weeks of instruction. They were individually matched with control students on sex, race, age, I.Q., first nine-week's grade averages, and subjects currently en- rolled in. Pre- and post-course administration of the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes (SSHA) was used to assess change in study orientation of the experimental group. At the end of the course, the Effective Study Test (EST) was given to both groups and grade point averages for the first, second, and third nine-weeks' grading periods</page><page sequence="137">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 267 were collected. Using Fisher's t for correlated samples, statistically significant differences between pre- and post-course means on the SSHA for the experimental group were found. Differences between means and standard deviations on the six sub-tests of the EST all favored the experimental group (.001 level). Total grade point average increase for the experimental group from the first to the third grading period was .26, a growth significant at the .001 level. No significant increase in grade point average was found for con- trol students. Laffey (229) followed the progress of culturally different college-bound students given thirteen two-hour class sessions in reading instruction. In addition to reading instruction, students were enrolled in several academic courses, attended counseling sessions, and were involved in a number of activities designed to broaden interests and tastes. Evaluation of the course was determined by both formal and informal measures. Alternate forms of the Davis Reading Test were employed as pre-and post-measures of formal evaluation. A difference significant at the .05 level was found for speed of read- ing in favor of post-test scores. No significant differences were found on the Davis for comprehension or total test scores, although differ- ences favored the post-test scores. Reading efficiency and identifica- tion of main ideas measured informally, both showed a difference significant at the .01 level of confidence in favor of final mean scores. Other measures showed no statistically significant gains. Two different writing tasks were assigned to students by Smith and Barter (363) in order to determine the effects of each on attitude toward and retention of reading matter. One task called for interpretation and the other for synthesizing. One half of the subjects in each of two social studies classes were given one of the tasks on a selection while the other half were required to write on the alternate task over the same material. A six-item Likert-type inventory measured attitude and a ten-item multiple choice test emphasizing factual recall was used to assess retention at the end of one- and two- month periods. The group receiving the interpretive-level task showed more favorable attitudes than did the synthesis-task group, although the differences fell short of statistical significance. No significant differences were found between the two groups on retention. Gibson and Vander Meulen (140) had English teachers ad- minister a 17-item questionnaire to students regarding their reading, study habits, and knowledge. At grade nine level, 20 per cent of the boys and 18 per cent of girls indicated they had difficulty in complet-</page><page sequence="138">268 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 ing reading assignments; while at grade twelve, the figures were 38.1 per cent and 26.9 per cent for boys and girls respectively. Through- out grades nine to twelve, about one fourth of the boys maintained they spent at least 30 minutes a day reading the newspaper; the figure was under 29 per cent for girls at each grade level. When asked if they felt one or more textbooks were too difficult to read, 20.8 per cent of grade nine boys and 36 per cent of grade twelve boys responded in the affirmative. Figures for girls were 17 per cent at grade nine and 31.9 per cent at grade twelve. Almost two thirds of the respondents at all grade levels felt their content teachers did not help them increase reading skills. Well over half of the students at each grade level reported they were reading an outside book. V-8 Teaching reading-college and adult Four research reports studied the effects of a college reading program on academic achievement. Hafner (153) investigated the effect of having or not having reading study skills instruction on the grade point averages of college students. Additionally, he sought to determine what differences existed between those students who profited from such instruction and those who did not. His control and experimental students were matched for initial grade point average and year in school. Data collected on experimental students included the Cattell Sixteen Personality-Factor Questionnaire, the College Stu- dents and Reading Questionnaire, grade point averages, and scores on either the Nelson-Denny Reading Test or the Cooperative Reading Comprehension Test. Experimental students met for four 50-minute periods for approximately eleven weeks while control students re- ceived no reading instruction. Grade point averages (GPA) were computed for the experimental quarter and for one quarter after- wards and compared with pre-experimental cumulative grade point. Neither experimental nor control students made significant gains or losses in GPA. However, a statistically significant larger number of experimental students than control students scored above a "C" average in the quarter following instruction. Students who profited most from instruction liked science subjects and reading better than did students who did not profit as much from instruction. Instruction did not result in significantly greater improvement in reading achieve- ment test scores. In studying the effect of a college reading program on grade point averages (GPA), Freer (131) matched forty pairs of students on the following variables: initial reading score on the Nelson-Denny</page><page sequence="139">Summary of reading research WENTRAUB, et al. 269 Reading Test, SCAT score, class load, age, and sex. Experimental students were diagnosed informally and also given the Diagnostic Reading Test and Word Clues Test. Alternate forms of the Nelson- Denny and Diagnostic tests were administered to the experimental students at the end of their reading course. Control students received no formal reading instruction. A higher GPA was made by experi- mental students. When data were compared for sex differences, males had an initially lower mean reading score and GPA than females. In a follow-up at the end of the sophomore year, it was found that those who took reading improved their reading achievement scores more than did control students. In Colvin's study (84), the effects of reading instruction on grade point average and achievement were also studied. Students who scored below the fiftieth percentile on the Cooperative Reading Comprehension Test were assigned randomly to either a control (no reading instruction) or an experimental group. Post-test scores on the Cooperative, grade point averages (GPA), and attrition rates were collected for both groups. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups for GPA or reading achievement scores. However, on every measure, the experimental group scored higher than did the control group. Both groups showed a significant growth in reading achievement. The author noted that the control students were given incidental aid in a number of ways that may have ac- counted for the lack of significant differences between the two groups. In Taschow's study (385), a comparison was made between the effectiveness of a ten-week corrective reading course versus a less intensive twenty-week course. Students had the same instructor, sequence of instruction, materials, and number of instructional hours. The same methods were employed in both courses. Immediate gains were measured by pre- and post-test raw score differences on alternate forms of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test. Retention of reading gains was determined by retesting on the Nelson-Denny ten weeks after the instruction had ceased. Instruction included work in vocabulary, comprehension, and rate development. Immediate results obtained differed little between the two groups. However, when retention scores were analyzed, a statistical difference significant at the .01 level of confidence was found in favor of the less intensive course. For both groups, significant improvement was made when comparing pre-test with immediate and with delayed post-test scores. The less intensive group also made statistically significant gains in vocabulary, compre- hension, and total reading when immediate and delayed post-test</page><page sequence="140">270 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 scores were compared. When the same comparison was made for the intensive course group, no significant differences appeared in rate or in comprehension. Appraisal of machine-aided instruction in improving vocabu- lary, comprehension, and rate for adults was the focus of a study by J. C. Johnson (201). Four groups were selected randomly. One received machine-aided instruction (experimental) and the other three received instruction without the use of machines (control). Classes, all taught by the same instructor, met one two-hour session per week for sixteen weeks. In addition, students were asked to spend 90 minutes a day practicing material of their own choosing. Pre- and post-test scores on alternate forms of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test were collected on all subjects. In both groups, students were told their pre-test scores and urged to double their rate while main- taining 80 per cent comprehension of material. In the machine- oriented group, a tachistoscope and a controlled reader were used in class, and a rateometer was utilized at home. When pre- and post- test scores were compared, both groups showed a statistically signi- ficant gain in vocabulary, comprehension, and rate. No significant differences were found between the two groups in any of the three areas. Brim (53) examined the impact of an experimental program of reading instruction on reading speed and comprehension. Percep- tual Development Laboratories Advanced Reading Program was used with subjects. Instruction consisted of 26 one-hour lessons and includ- ed exercises in tachistoscopic training. All students did not complete all the lessons. Equivalent forms of the PDL battery consisting of two 2000-word articles followed by ten-item multiple choice tests were administered as pre- and post-tests and yielded three scores: total words read per minute (WPM), percentage of words compre- hended per minute, and total words read and comprehended per minute. For each of the twelve groups studied, pre- and post-test means on each of the three scores were compared and differences tested for significance using the Student's t. In eleven of the groups, a change in reading rate significant at the .01 level occurred; in the twelfth group, the change was significant at the .05 level. Changes in comprehension scores were not statistically significant, indicating that although subjects' per cent of words comprehended remained the same, more words per minute were being comprehended. In all groups, differences between pre- and post-test means for the total</page><page sequence="141">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 271 number of words read and comprehended per minute were signifi- cant beyond the .01 level. V-9 Grouping Three studies focused on various aspects of grouping and organizational procedures. Using the Revised Observer Schedule and Record Form II and video-tape recording, Morrison (284) studied teacher-pupil interaction patterns in 81 classrooms. In the class- rooms selected, teachers used one of three grouping procedures with instructional materials: single reading texts for everyone, multi-level reading texts, or supplementary and/or individualized reading ma- terials. Four dimensions of interaction were investigated: 1] class- room activities-comprised of categories of leadership, participation, assistance, and mobility; 2] uses of instructional materials; 3] teach- ing styles and pupil responses; and 4] emotional and affective climate. The sample used included 28 outer-city, 26 mid-city, and 27 inner- city groups. Video-taped observations of teachers and pupils engaged in reading activities were coded on the four dimensions by three trained observers. A t test of significant differences between inde- pendent means was used to analyze the data. In classrooms using single texts, the following behaviors were noted: less participation and less assistance to pupils; less mobility; less individualized pro- visions in all activities; less positive verbal, physical, and covert be- haviors; and less pupil leadership opportunities. The use of multi- level and supplementary reading materials showed the greatest number of positive aspects of classroom interactions in classroom activities, in two of four teaching styles-pupil responses, in total uses of instructional materials by number and by variety, and in the majority of positive affective behaviors. Balow (24) evaluated the effect on reading achievement of smaller class size obtained by using staggered instructional periods. Half of each class came one hour early for reading and language instruction while the other half remained later. All beginning first- grade classrooms, experimental and control, were given the Metro- politan Readiness Tests (MRT). All grade two and three children were given the Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT), Reading sub-test and grade four classes received the Sequential Tests of Edu- cational Progress (STEP). The California Short Form Test of Mental Maturity (CTMM) was administered to all second grades. After one year of instruction, the experimental group that had started the program in grade one scored significantly higher on the MAT than</page><page sequence="142">272 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 did the control group. When all grades were analyzed by sex, the difference in achievement was found to be primarily for boys rather than for girls and held true at grades two, three, and four. Grade three comparisons, with second-grade reading scores controlled for, indicated that experimental children gained more than did control children. However, there was no significant difference in MAT scores between classes who had been in the program one year only and control classes. No significant differences were found between groups at fourth-grade level when grade three achievement was held constant. However, when STEP achievement was compared, with MRT or CTMM scores controlled for, statistically significant differ- ences favoring the experimental group were noted. The author con- cluded that the influence of the program was cumulative, i.e., the longer a child was in the program, the greater the benefit to him. It was also felt that the findings gave support to the idea that reduced class size was beneficial for children at all readiness levels. Data collected from another project were analyzed by Nichols (290) who studied the effectiveness of interclass grouping for read- ing instruction at the primary grades. In the school using interclass grouping, children were randomly assigned in grades one and two to one of three homeroom classes. For reading instruction, reassign- ment was made on the basis of readiness and of intelligence test scores. In two other schools used for comparison purposes, a self- contained plan was followed. Only children of above or below aver- age intelligence and readiness scores were included in the analysis. The Word Meaning, Paragraph Meaning, Spelling, and Word Study Skills sub-test scores on the Metropolitan were used as criterion measures of achievement. In both the above average and below average groups, achievement test scores favored the self-contained classes. No level of significance was reported. In England, Shields (354) focused on the effect of the transi- tion from the infant school to the junior school on reading achieve- ment. Three different types of school organization plans were sam- pled: 1] physically separate infant and junior schools; 2] separately organized schools on the same site; and 3] combined schools where the children remained in one school under one administrator. Chil- dren were tested in the last term of the infant course and again at the end of their first year in junior school on the Holburn Sentence Reading Test. Some of the children (73 per cent) were given a non-verbal group test. Other data collected included a measure of the book being read, attendance at nursery school, and number of</page><page sequence="143">Summary of reading research WEINTRAuB, et al. 273 terms at school. Mean gains of children who made a complete change at the time of transition were significantly greater than the average for the sample as a whole, although actual differences were not large. Nursery school attendance appeared to be positively related to read- ing performance. V-10 Corrective and remedial instruction A number of new remedial techniques and experimental programs of corrective and remedial reading were studied and evalu- ated in the period of time covered by this summary. Several studies were reports of Title I funded projects. Rider and Martinez (323) surveyed 21 Title I remedial reading projects from districts in Cali- fornia reporting substantial or moderate progress in instruction and attempted to identify and analyze their characteristics. Data were obtained from the project evaluation reports and from on-site ob- servation. Included in the analysis were characteristics of students, systems used for remedial reading instruction, and cost factors. Among the findings reported were the following: 1] almost 70 per cent of the students enrolled in the programs were boys with the percentage in individual districts ranging from 60 to 90 per cent; 2] slightly over one third of the students enrolled had a language background other than English; 3] a negative attitude toward read- ing was ranked as the primary problem associated with lack of achieve- ment in reading at all grade levels; 4] instruction was conducted by reading specialists with para-professional assistance available in al- most half the districts; 5] no one method or approach to remedial instruction was used by all districts; and 6] communication systems between the reading specialists and the classroom teacher had been established at all grade levels. The report of a six-week Title I summer remedial reading program was presented by Spieth (368). At grade one level, four different approaches to instruction were used: basal reader, language arts, programed, and Words in Color. With second-grade pupils, a programed approach and an approach using a kit of materials were contrasted. In addition, children were diagnosed as either behavior problems, withdrawn, or perceptually handicapped, and the teaching approach most efficient for each type was determined. A type of operant conditioning was also employed in setting expected goals on a daily basis. The Lee-Clark Reading Test was used to assess gains in the six-week period. Children in the language arts group showed an overall reading gain of 2.15 months; gain in the reading kit</page><page sequence="144">274 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY ? Winter 1970 V/2 group was 2.00 months; in Words in Color, 1.50 months; and in the basal reader, .57 months. The language arts approach also was most useful with the withdrawn, older child. Programed materials were best with children who exhibited behavior problems. The author reported that operant conditioning was effective for all except per- ceptually handicapped children. In a follow-up report on his summer program, Spieth (369) again employed a modified operant conditioning plan with 60 grade one and 60 grade two parochial school pupils grouped in classes of 15 children each. In addition to a regular teacher, one teacher's aide was employed for each class and a half. Weekly group sessions for parents were also set up with social workers and psychologists. Teachers were instructed to use a kinesthetic, language experience, or programed approach with children, depending on whether a child was classified as perceptually impaired, withdrawn, or a behavior problem. Pre- and post-measures were obtained on the Lee-Clark Reading Test, the digit span section of the WISC, and the Bender- Gestalt Test. Comparisons were also made with previous groups in- structed in the RISE summer program. All children showed some gain on the Lee-Clark with perceptually handicapped children exhibiting the least amount of growth. The author concluded on the basis of several RISE programs that children with behavior problems bene- fitted the most from a programed approach and that children with perceptual motor handicaps did not make startling gains with the methods employed. He felt that typing children was a useful approach to a teaching strategy. Education of teachers and/or feedback from teachers relative to remedial techniques was the orientation of three studies. In the first of these, Ramsey (316) conducted a pilot study in which videotapes were made of teachers working with children who were receiving remedial instruction over a six-week period. Eight teachers viewed tapes of themselves in an attempt to gain insight into means for improving their own instruction. Four children viewed tapes of themselves with the teacher, and the teacher tried to help the child to gain insight into his own behavior. Children from both instruction groups were tested on the Dolch List of Basic Vocabulary and on the Burnett Reading-Survey. The differences in gains between the two groups were not significant. In a survey study done in England, Sampson (340) asked teachers engaged in remedial education to name the incentive they found most effective with their pupils. The response rate to the</page><page sequence="145">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 275 questionnaire was 91 per cent. The following six categories were used to analyze the responses: 1] relationship and atmosphere; 2] the experience of success; 3] praise and encouragement; 4] the child's interests; 5] rewards and privileges; and 6] competitiveness and ambition. Category 2 was mentioned frequently, 31 per cent of the time, followed by category 3. Also presented were differences be- tween response patterns of respondents who worked full or part time, who were borough or county teachers, and who lived in the north or south. Growth in skills and attitudes of both secondary teachers and disabled readers was assessed by Schirmer and Navarre (345) in their evaluation of a six-week summer seminar. Pupils met in small groups for a two-hour daily instructional period for five weeks. Teachers attended the full day, using the morning period to prepare, instruct, and evaluate and the afternoon period for seminars and professional reading. Teacher growth was evaluated by an instruc- tor-developed test administered at the beginning and end of the six-week period. The Gray Oral Reading Test was given as a pre- and post-measure of achievement to students. In addition, attitude change was assessed for teachers on the Minnesota Attitude Survey and students on the California Test of Personality. The mean reading gain for the 26 students was .41 years. Only one statistically signifi- cant coefficient of correlation was obtained between reading achieve- ment and the attitude measure, a -.58 for junior high students. Nine of the ten teachers showed improvement on the informal test of knowledge of methodology. New instructional techniques were evaluated in three studies. Concerned with finding more efficient means of developing reading skills among remedial children, Heckelman (171) tested the effective- ness of a neurological impress-remedial reading method. The method required unison oral reading by pupil and teacher with the pupil placed slightly to the front of the teacher while the book was jointly held. The subjects were in grades seven through ten with reading abilities at least three or more years below grade placement and expectancy. A number of tests including the WISC, the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt, the California Personality Test, and the Gilmore Oral Reading Test were administered. Instruction was given 15 minutes daily on an individual basis for six weeks. At the end of seven hours and fifteen minutes of instruction, results were evaluated by readmin- istration of the Gilmore and a silent reading assessment on the Cali- fornia Achievement Tests. Mean gain in reading comprehension was</page><page sequence="146">276 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 1.9 grade levels, a gain found to be statistically significant (.001 level). The primary purpose of the study by Abrams and Belmont (3) was to compare the effects, for severely retarded readers, of full-time specialized reading instruction with the effects of instruc- tion ordinarily given and to compare the effects of individual versus group psychotherapy. Four groups of four boys were matched ac- cording to intelligence, age, number of years in school, and socio- economic status. Subjects all had WISC scores of 90 or above, were unable to recognize at least 50 per cent of the words on the Temple University Individual Word Recognition Test and had comprehension scores of 50 per cent or less on an informal reading inventory. Groups were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: 1] special in- struction and individual psychotherapy; 2] special instruction and group psychotherapy; 3] individual psychotherapy only; and 4] group psychotherapy only. In addition, medication was given two boys in each group and a placebo was administered to the other two. The Stanford Achievement Test (SAT), Word Meaning and Paragraph Meaning sub-tests, was used as the criterion measure. The two groups receiving instruction made significantly greater improvement on the SAT than did those receiving psychotherapy only. No other significant differences were found. Haring and Hauck (160) described the individual program- ing, in a small group setting, of the learning conditions for four boys who were severely disabled in reading. The boys were average or above in intelligence but one to five years retarded in reading skills. Reading materials were sequentially ordered in a programed format with reinforcement provided on a point system. Points were exchangeable for edibles, trinkets, and toys. Pupil responses were measured both orally and in written form. Reinforcing events were arranged in such a manner as to first accelerate performance rate and then maintain the high rate and were sequenced through six distinct periods. Teacher instruction in this setting occurred primarily during oral reading. Almost all teacher communication was pre- planned and prepared in script form. Results of the program were discussed under three categories: 1] a comparison of response data under conditions prior to the experimental conditions with those under experimental conditions; 2] reading skill progress; and 3] re- inforcer preference. Under pre-experimental conditions, subjects averaged 2.8 correct responses per session and spent considerable time not reading. Under experimental conditions, average response</page><page sequence="147">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 277 rates increased as did the length of work period. In the five months of instruction, reading levels increased from one and one half to four years. Preferred reinforcers tended to be edibles and expen- sive items. Attitudes toward reading and changes in reading achieve- ment were examined by Cashdan and Pumfrey (70). Three groups of 12 boys each were matched on the basis of low-average ability on an intelligence test and a reading age at least two years behind their chronological age. Group A boys were given remedial instruction in thirty to sixty minute sessions twice weekly in groups of four. Group B members were instructed once weekly for sessions of similar length and in groups of from four to six. Group C was used as a control group and no special reading help was given. At the end of two terms, all boys were re-tested on the Burt-Vernon Reading Test and examined on the Daniels and Diack Standard Test of Reading Skill. Approxi- mately two years later, the Burt test was re-administered and the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability was given. A scale assessing atti- tude toward reading was also administered. No statistically significant differences were noted between groups on the Burt test or on the Standard test at the end of two terms. In the follow-up period, there were no significant differences between groups on either the Burt or the Neale tests. The attitude measure also showed no significant differences among groups. Burmeister (59) had two purposes in her study of word analysis generalizations: 1] the identification of important phonic and structural analysis generalizations above the primary level; and 2] the assessment of a deductive versus an inductive approach to instruction of the generalizations. Subjects were eighth- and ninth- grade students who were found in an average or heterogeneous class- room and who could pronounce at least 20 but no more than 52 of the 65 key words on the Gates Reading Survey, Reading Vocabulary Test. A stratified random sampling of words by frequency was taken from the Thorndike and Lorge word list. A level of utility for each generalization studied was then computed on the total word sample. Those generalizations with at least a 90 per cent utility level were selected to be taught in two two-week instructional plans, one using an inductive, and the other, a deductive approach. None of the 12 teachers involved had had previous experience in teaching word analysis generalizations. Each teacher had three sections ran- domly assigned to one of the two experimental approaches or to a control class. Within each classroom, nine randomly selected dis-</page><page sequence="148">278 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 abled readers served as the sample. A post-test only design was used with the Reading Vocabulary Test of the Gates as the criterion measure for both oral and silent reading. In oral reading, differences among the three groups were significant at the .01 level, favoring the two experimental groups over the control. There were no signi- ficant mean differences between the two experimental groups. No statistically significant differences were found among the groups in oral reading. Effie Adams (5) reported the results of a brief questionnaire mailed to forty reading clinics operating in colleges and universities throughout the United States. Of these, 24 reported offering some form of tutoring service to 3,655 students, 13 reported that no tutoring services were offered and no reply was received from 3. The report does not make clear whether or not comparable services were included on each campus. Fees charged by various clinics ranged from none in 9 clinics serving 1,584 students to $300 per semester for individual tutoring. Of the 861 tutors in the 24 clinics, 132 were paid professionals, 359 paid tutors, and 370 unpaid tutors probably enrolled for course credit. A great variety of tests was reported as being used by the various clinics with one clinic report- ing more than a hundred different tests available for use by tutors. In a multi-stage study, Blake, Aaron, and Westbrook (35) 1] selected fifty basal reading skills as being representative of im- portant components of the reading act and organized them into categories and sequences within the categories; 2] identified four intel- lectual processes related to each basal reading skill and noted the extent of relationship and relative contribution of each of these to each reading skill; 3] described trends in the achievement of the various skills for intellectually retarded, normal, and superior pupils; and 4] compared growth in achievement of these skills in retarded and normal groups and in normal and superior groups. Subjects were from 44 public school classes and had to meet the following criteria for inclusion in the study: intelligence quotients of 50 or higher, reading instructional placement in grades two through five of a basal reading program, and freedom from severe physical, sensory, or emotional difficulties. Because of the extensiveness of the study and the detailed nature of the report, only selected findings and con- clusions can be highlighted here. It was possible to arrange 30 of the 50 sub-skills along a dimension of complexity in four categories: phonetic analysis, structional analysis, dictionary, and comprehen-</page><page sequence="149">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 279 sion. Associative memory, conceptualization, verbal meaning, and reasoning were all found to be related to achievement in the respec- tive basal reading skills. In combination, the four processes contri- buted to explaining from 1 to 48 per cent of the variance in the skills with associative memory contributing least. Within each of the three groups of children, a significant linear trend was found in the means of achievement at each instructional level for a majority of the skills. When compared, retarded and normal groups and normal and superior groups showed both similarities and differences in the level of acquisition of basal reading skills. The differences varied with the nature of the skills and the reading instructional level. In most skills, differences were not found in rate of acquisition between retarded and normal readers or between normal and superior readers. V-11 Teaching materials Content analysis studies, the effectiveness of illustrations, and the consistency of sound-symbol relationships in words used in various materials were among the type of studies included in this section. Four studies were reported in which the contents of basal readers were analyzed from various standpoints. Ozmon (302) was concerned with the values reflected in primary readers and their relationship to educational philosophies. Five widely used basal series were found to contain 56 value themes. A group of professors and students, all versed in educational philosophy, then categorized the value themes as representative of one of five educational philoso- phies: perennialism, essentialism, progressivism, reconstructionism, and existentialism. Of the 56 value themes, more than one third were selected as progressive in nature and over one fourth as existential The author interpreted the findings as an indication of a liberal approach to characters and stories and a rejection of authoritarian values. He felt the values found in these textbooks represented an optimistic, open, and creative attitude toward the world and other people. The content of four Canadian readers, two for grade one and two for grade two, were analyzed by Grenda (148) under five categories: family interaction, children's familiarization and interac- tion with animals, children's interaction in play, urban-rural emphasis, and holidays (Christmas and Easter). The family was depicted as middle class and as a complete, cohesive, harmoniously inter- acting unit, devoid of conflicts or differences of personal opinion.</page><page sequence="150">280 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 Parental sex role was found to be decisively defined and dichotomous. All books contained at least one chapter on children and animals. Children's interactions appeared amiable, subdued, and cooperative with an omission of quarrels and physical violence. Children took part in the major sports and recreational activities found in Canada such as skiing and skating. No hint of racial interaction appeared and no slums or deprived areas were depicted. Only the festival aspects of holidays was stressed. The author felt that reading text- books were instruments that unwittingly reinforced and engendered prejudices and created misleading impressions of the social reality surrounding the child. A different sort of content analysis was undertaken by Rooze (330). In his report, the generalizations or objectives from a first-grade reading series and a first-grade curriculum syllabus were analyzed and then evaluated according to the affective Domain Taxonomy previously developed by Krathwohl, Bloom, and Masia. The two materials emphasized different behaviors. The basal series more often called for behavior at the awareness level rather than at a level calling for change. The curriculum guide stressed many ob- jectives which required the child to accept values or beliefs, and accept himself and others. Marksberry, McCarter, and Noyce (257) compared cogni- tive objectives found in textbooks from four curriculum areas includ- ing reading with cognitive objectives of national committees and with questions and activities suggested by Teachers' Editions of the text- books. The objectives were classified by three analyzers and the questions and activities in the textbooks were classified by the cate- gories of the Taxonomy in Educational Objectives Handbook 1: Cogni- tive Domain. A caculation was made of the proportions of objectives in each category and then the differences between uncorrelated proportions were found. In Reading, no objectives classified as Syn- thesis were found, and 5 per cent or less were classified as Evaluation. Most of the objectives found in textbooks were classified as Knowl- edge, a recall and recognition type skill. When activities and ques- tions were classified, the largest percentage at both primary and intermediate levels fell into the Comprehension category. Very small percentages of activities and questions at either primary or inter- mediate level were classified as Analysis, Synthesis, or Evaluation. Inconsistencies between objectives implied by national committees and those stated in textbooks were found. National committees</page><page sequence="151">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 281 implied the need for teaching all the problem solving skills, but textbooks placed little emphasis on the higher level skills. Dwyer (106) reported two studies on illustrations. In the first, he randomly assigned college freshmen to one of nine treat- ment groups in a study done to determine the relative effectiveness of eight types of visual illustrations designed to complement pro- gramed material. In each of his groups, students received programed material dealing with the same topic, the heart. A control group received no illustrations with its materials. The experimental groups received one of the following presentations: 1] abstract black-and- white line illustrations; 2] abstract color line illustrations; 3] detailed, shaded black-and-white drawings; 4] detailed shaded color drawings; 5] black-and-white photographs of a heart model; 6] black-and-white photographs of a realistic heart; 7] color photographs of a heart model; and 8] color photographs of a realistic heart. Students received a pre- test and four individual criterial tests combined into a total criterial post-test score. Individual criterial measures were drawing, identifica- tion, terminology, and comprehension tests. Analysis of variance tech- niques showed the groups differed significantly on all criterial meas- ures except comprehension. The colored version of the heart model was most effective in transmitting that information measured by the identification test and significantly more effective than the black-and- white version on the drawing and on the total criterial tests. On the drawing test, the black-and-white abstract line group achieved better than did the control group, the black-and-white detailed shading group, or the black-and-white heart model group. In his second study on the effectiveness of various types of illustrations, Dwyer (107) randomly assigned ninth graders to one of five treatment groups. Group I received instruction via booklets typed in regular textbook fashion with no visual illustrations. Experi- mental subjects were given their instruction by means of programed booklets with an illustration accompanying each of the 37 frames. Verbal information was held constant for all groups. Four different types of illustrations were presented. Four criterion measures were used: 1] drawing, 2] identification, 3] terminology, and 41 compre- hension. All scores were added into a 78-item total. An analysis of variance indicated that experimental students required more time to complete instruction than did control pupils. Students presented with the line drawing took longest of all. Control students achieved as well as experimental students on drawing, identification, and total</page><page sequence="152">282 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 test. The photographic presentation was more effective on the drawing and identification tests than the programed presentation alone. On the delayed retention test, the line presentation was found more effective than the drawing presentation on comprehension and on the total test. Consistency of grapheme-phoneme relationships was the sub- ject of three studies. Maresh (255) followed a five-step approach in her investigation of phonic generalizations and their level of utility. Using the books through the third grade in four series of basal readers, she compiled a composite list of words and generalizations. Two dictionaries then were used as sources for pronunciation and the phonic respellings of words recorded. Two lists, one of words conforming to the generalization and one of exceptions, were com- piled. A per cent of utility was calculated for each generalization by dividing the total number of words for each generalization by the total number of conforming words. A comparison of the utility level for each generalization within each series and among the four series was then made. Three of the four series did not reach a 70 per cent level of utility. The author stated that the reason for this was that the generalizations were too broad and too many exceptions had to be included in the words presented. Fuld (137) compiled a list of words that appeared in five basal reading series together with the Dolch and Fry lists. From this initial listing, 613 were located that contained a single vowel fol- lowed by two consonants (VCC). The VCC words were then analyzed to determine which ones followed the short vowel rule. Of the total list, 431 words or 70 per cent contained a short vowel. Longer words were more consistent in following the VCC rule than were words of three or four letters. Birnie (34) re-examined four texts written in t.o. and in i.t.a. for the number of words, sounds, and letters used; for the number of sound-symbol consistencies and four types of inconsist- encies; and for the percentage of inconsistencies from doubling letters, the schwa vowel, high frequency words, and capital letters. Analysis of sounds used in the four texts when compared with letters showed that t.o. texts had fewer letters than sounds, whereas i.t.a. texts had almost a one-to-one relationship of letters to sounds. In addition, t.o. texts had both a greater number of all types of incon- sistencies and a higher proportion of inconsistencies to one-to-one symbol-sound relationships. The highest percentage of inconsisten-</page><page sequence="153">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 283 cies in t.o. texts came from high frequency words; in i.t.a. texts, the schwa vowel yielded the highest percentage of inconsistencies. Maki and Kinnunen (253) compared sentence length and word repetition in the 1879 edition of the McGuffey first-grade reader with that in a modern first-grade reader. The modern first reader contained 1450 sentences; the McGuffey reader, 546. The range of sentence length in the modern reader was from one word to twenty- one words. In the McGuffey reader, sentence length ranged from one to twenty-eight words. Median sentence length was 8.0 words in the McGuffey reader and 7.1 in the modern reader. Average sentence length was 8.95 and 7.1 words, respectively. In the McGuffey reader, 13.8 per cent of the words were repeated ten or more times and the median repetition was 2.4. The modern reader provided for repetition of all words at least ten times. Marks (256) explored the extent of agreement among seven reading lists concerning titles, interest levels, and classification of books for reluctant readers. A total of 1477 different trade-book titles was tabulated. No title appeared on more than five different lists while 1084 titles appeared in only one list. A small amount of varia- tion was found in the estimated reading grade levels and in the classification of content among lists. V-12 Teaching-testing The greatest number of studies appearing in the Teaching section of this year's annual summary fall into this category. Within the Testing sub-section, most research was reported on the predictive validity of various instruments, primarily ones at the readiness or early reading levels. Other investigations focused on a variety of problems within the field of testing including construct validity, a new means of assessing comprehension, and a study proposing a means of measuring reading skills falling at a level between word recognition and comprehension. Farr (121) reported a two-phase study using convergent and discriminant validity as a means for investigating the construct valid- ity of tests. In the first part of the study, ninth-grade students of average ability were given the appropriate levels of the Nelson Read- ing Test, California Reading Test, and Gates Reading Survey. Pear- son correlation coefficients were computed among all sub-test and total scores and examined for convergent and discriminant validity. The correlations among the ten variables ranged from .42 to .81,</page><page sequence="154">284 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 indicating the tests were measuring some common factor, and thus met the criteria for convergent validity. However, the criteria for dis- criminant validity were not met by any of the tests. A factor analysis resulted in isolating only one factor with an eigenvalue greater than one. The factor accounted for over 70 per cent of the total variance of all the sub-tests. In the second phase of the study, 91 undergraduate education majors were given the Cooperative English Tests-Reading Comprehension, the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, and the California Reading Test. The same statistical procedures were employed with the scores from these tests as with scores from the tests given to grade nine students. Again, strong evidence for convergent validity was found. Although some of the sub-tests gave evidence of dis- criminant validity, a number did not. A factor analysis on the col- lege test scores isolated two factors with eigenvalues greater than unity, a reading vocabulary factor, and a reading comprehension factor. They accounted for 60 per cent and for 13 per cent respec- tively of the total test variance. Farr pointed to the need for test constructors to determine discriminant validity. Arnold and Arnold (14) collected and compared standard- ized test scores, informal test data, and reading level judgments of clinicians and of tutors on their population of severely disabled read- ers. Binet, WISC, or WAIS scores on the sample ranged from 70 to 133. The Gates Primary Reading Test, the Gates Advanced Primary Reading Test, and the Gates Reading Survey were the standardized instruments used. Informal inventories from a basal reader series were used as measures of word pronunciation in isolation, and the reading test of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) was used as a measureof pronunciation of words in isolation. Compari- sons were made between clinicians' and tutors' judgments of inde- pendent and instructional reading levels and 1] the Gates scores, 2] informal inventory levels, 3] the WRAT score, 4] the highest score of all three tests, 5] the lowest test score, and 6] the mean of the three tests. Correlation coefficients for both clinician and tutor judgment tended to be highest with the WRAT (.63 to .80), next highest with the Gates tests (.47 to .81), and ranged from .22 to .69 with informal inventories. Merritt's (272) aim was to develop a way of assessing what he termed intermediate reading skills. Intermediate skills were defined as being above the level of single word recognition but below the level of meaning; they were assessed by having subjects</page><page sequence="155">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 285 read passages that were approximations to English. Subjects were 19 eight-year-old children and 19 nine- and ten-year-old children. In order to reduce the influence of the word recognition factor, 37 very high frequency words taken from the McNally and Murray list of key words were used. Four tests, each 111 words in length, were prepared in the following forms: Al] words printed in random sequence with each word appearing three times; A2] words printed in random sequence but appearing in proportion to their frequency of occurrence in B2; B1] words equally represented as in Al, but rearranged in accordance with the probability of their following the immediately preceding word in normal text; B21 words chosen any number of times but arranged as in B1. The order of administering the experimental tests was systematically varied. Each child was also given the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability. Data from experi- mental tests were examined in terms of accuracy and speed. B tests were read with greater speed and with fewer errors than were A tests. A marked increase in fluency with age was noted. Chase (73) experimented with the development of a reading test designed to give pupils opportunity to respond to comprehension questions at a concrete or abstract level. Fourteen short stories with controlled vocabulary were constructed and followed by three state- ments, one at each level and one distractor. Pupils were asked to select the statement that best told what the story said. Data were analyzed by sex, grade level, and teacher judgment of reading skill. More mature readers preferred the abstract category more often than did the younger pupils. Pupils judged as better readers tended to give the abstract response more often than did poorer readers. No sex differences were noted. At least five studies explored various aspects of testing cul- turally different children. Henderson and Long (172) explored the relationship between scores on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests and 17 noncognitive variables. Subjects were 192 children, equally divided by sex and race. Some control of socio-economic level was attempted by selecting half of the pupils from classes 6 and 7 on Hollingshead's Occupational Scale and half from classes 1 through 5. The various groups were found to differ significantly on the 17 measures. Negroes had lower self-esteem, less pre-school education, less preference for father, and fewer fathers in the home. They also obtained significantly lower scores on the readiness test. Boys tended to obtain lower scores than girls. Eight of the 17 variables were found to</page><page sequence="156">286 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY ? Winter 1970 V/2 be significantly related to readiness with the three best predictors of readiness test scores being pre-school education (r=.50), teachers' ratings (r=.39), and chronological age (r=.32). The practice effects of two different tests used with Head Start children were examined by Hutton (189). Group I, consisting of 26 children, was given the Slosson Intelligence Test (SIT) first, followed by the Sprigle School Readiness Screening Test (SSRST). Group II, with 42 children, was administered the tests in reverse order. All subjects received the Scholastic Test of Academic Readi- ness (STAR) following the other two. Raw scores were converted to t scores and data were analyzed by a mixed 2 x 3 analysis of variance design. The groups did not differ significantly on their STAR scores. Practice effects appeared to be only minimally significant (.10 level). In Canada, Macdonald and Netherton (250) administered the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices to grade two pupils and the Standard Progressive Matrices 1958 to grade four subjects along with appropriate levels of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT). The purpose was to determine if the Progressive Matrices, a non-ver- bal test, could contribute to the assessment of the educational potential of non-English speaking pupils. Both indigenous Eskimo and Indian children and other children were tested. Data were anal- yzed by factor analysis techniques and factors accounting for 5 per cent or more of the total variance were rotated using the Varimax Criterion. When mean scores were compared for indigenous and other populations, mean scores on all the achievement sub-tests of the MAT were higher for the other group, but mean scores on the Progressive Matrices were similar for both groups. Analysis of the factored data indicated that the scores on the MAT sub-tests were less a reflection of the students' intellectual potential as measured by the Progressive Matrices in the indigenous group than in the other groups. Knowledge or ignorance of verbal skills weighed so heavily in the performance of indigenous groups on the achievement tests as to obscure intellectual potential. The authors felt that teachers needed knowledge of pupils' intellectual potential and that this knowledge could not be gleaned from performance on achievement tests where Eskimo and Indian children were concerned. Davis and Personke (94) administered the Metropolitan Readiness Tests in English and in Spanish to their Spanish-speaking population. Two groups, presented the two modes in alternate order, were formed. A three-week period elapsed between administrations. Contrasts of mean differences of total and sub-test scores between the</page><page sequence="157">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 287 two modes of presentation yielded mostly non-significant differences. The coefficient of correlation between scores on the two versions of the total test was .63 for the total group, .76 for the group given the English version first, and .73 for the group receiving the Spanish version first. On the Word Meaning sub-test, children performed at a significantly higher level when given the test in Spanish. However, on the Alphabet and Numbers sub-tests, scores favored the English administration. Arnold (15) determined the reliability of three tests when used with bilingual children. In September of grade three, the subjects were administered the following tests: the Word Knowledge, Word Discrimination, and Reading sub-tests on the Metropolitan Achieve- ment Tests, Primary II; the Comprehension, Vocabulary, and Speed of Comprehension sub-tests on the Inter-American Reading Tests, given both in English and in Spanish; and the IPAT Culture-Fair Intelligence Tests. A split-half reliability or Alpha Coefficient, a measure of internal consistency, was computed for each test. The Alpha coefficients for the Metropolitan ranged from .87 to .95; for the Inter-American, from .68 to .91 in English and .51 to .72 in Spanish; and from .21 to .77 for the various scores on the IPAT. Arnold commented on the need to interpret the findings in the light of the fact that the subjects had been exposed to two years of intensive oral language instruction. Two reports appeared assessing reliability and/or inter- correlations among tests and sub-tests used with intermediate age pupils. R. L. Linn (238) analyzed the test-retest results on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills given to the same students in fifth grade and again in eighth grade. Intercorrelations of the grade equivalent scores at the two test periods were computed and means and standard deviations presented. Coefficients of correlation between the eighth- grade Reading sub-test score on the Iowa and Vocabulary, Reading, Language, and Study Skills scores at grade five were .77, .79, .68, and .74, respectively. The grade five Reading score correlated .76, .79, .69, and .72 with grade eight sub-test scores of Vocabulary, Reading, Language, and Study Skills. McCall and McCall (259) administered five diagnostic read- ing tests at a single grade level in order to study their validity and the interrelationships among them. The following instruments were administered: 1] Bond, Clymer, Hoyt Silent Diagnostic Reading Test; 2] Doren Diagnostic Reading Test; 3] McKee Inventory of Phonetic Skills; 4] McCullough Word Analysis Test (Experimental Edition);</page><page sequence="158">288 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 and 5] Roswell-Chall Diagnostic Reading Test of Word Analysis Skills. Criterion measures included teacher rankings on reading com- prehension, word recognition, and arithmetic ability; grade three scores on comprehension, reading, and arithmetic from the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS); third-grade reading and arithmetic grades; and the I.Q. score on the California Test of Mental Maturity (CTMM). Coefficients of correlation were computed between each sub-test of the five diagnostic reading tests and the criterion tests. Tests correlated higher with teacher rankings than with other criteria. When intercorrelations among the five diagnostic measures were com- puted, it was found that the Bond, McCullough, and Doren tests shared considerable common variance (64 per cent) and correlated higher with the Roswell than with the McKee. The highest correla- tions for the reading tests were with measures of arithmetic ability rather than reading. The authors concluded that the five measures have acceptable validity coefficients. Holtzman and Brown (183) described the development of a new form of the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes (SSHA) for grades seven to twelve and presented data on its reliability and val- idity. Items from the college level form were modified by two com- mittees, one composed of teachers and one of students, and then administered to all students in grades seven to twelve in one school system to check on student difficulties in responding to items. The 100 items were then assigned to one of the following four sub-scales: Delay Avoidance, Work Methods, Teacher Approval, and Education Acceptance. Scores on the first two combined to give the Study Habit score, and scores on the last two combined to yield the Study Attitude score. The Study Orientation Score was obtained by combining all four sub-scales. Reliability of the new form, H, was determined by test-retest means using 237 grade nine students. For the four sub- scales, reliability coefficients were .95, .93, .93, and .94. In stand- ardizing the test, scores on the SSHA, a scholastic aptitude test, and fall semester grade point averages were collected on 10,888 students in grades seven to twelve in seven school systems. The scholastic aptitude tests varied among school systems and included at least eight different tests. Intercorrelations of the seven SSHA scores, scholastic aptitude tests, and grade point averages were computed separately for each grade and school system. The average coefficient of correla- tion between total SSHA score and grade point average was .49; a mean coefficient of correlation of .27 was obtained between SSHA and the scholastic aptitude test. With scholastic aptitude partialled</page><page sequence="159">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 289 out, the coefficient of correlation between SSHA and grade point average ranged from .41 to .47 across the six grade levels. Mean intercorrelation coefficients of the sub-scale scores ranged from .51 to .75. With grade point average, the sub-scales correlated .41, .47, .35, and .48. In the study by Littrell (240), teachers' rankings of students on four traits were compared with students' scores on the Diagnostic Reading Survey (DRT). During the first semester of the school year, 28 teachers were asked to observe students with respect to the use of vocabulary, effective use of reference materials, amount of reading, and the initiative shown in exploring new areas of learning. In February, teachers rated students on the four traits using a five-point scale. Coefficients of correlation were then run between teachers' rankings and DRT scores. Tetrachoric r's were used to establish the relationships between teachers' estimates of superiority on the four traits and measured superiority in reading. Moderately high relation- ships (.46 to .62) were found between DRT scores and teacher estimates of the four traits. A moderate relationship was also noted between teachers' selections of superior students and superior stu- dents as measured on the DRT. By far the most studies in this sub-section investigated different means of predicting primary grade achievement. Several studies included teacher judgment as one of their measures. Keogh and Smith (211) administered the Bender-Gestalt as a group test to a kindergarten population in September, November, February, and May. Protocols were then scored on a five-point rating scale and on eight clinical signs and analyzed for changes in performance. In addition, in May, classroom teachers were asked to rate children for reading readiness on a one to five scale. When scores of boys and girls were compared, girls performed better than boys on the Septem- ber testing but no differences appeared in subsequent administrations. The greatest change in performance, as determined by analysis of variance, occurred between the first two administrations of the test with another significant increase showing between February and May. Correlational analyses of the Bender total scores on the four admini- strations yielded Pearson r's ranging from .55 to .65. Teachers' ratings of readiness correlated .51 with the September Bender score but only .38 with the Bender score in May. Zaruba (416) studied the predictive values of three reading readiness measures and also compared teacher evaluation of reading achievement at the end of grade one with standardized test results.</page><page sequence="160">290 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 In September, scores were obtained on letter recognition, drawing a man, and subjective teacher appraisal. The Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) was administered in May of grade one and a reading grade placement score was assigned to each child by his teacher. On all measures, girls scored higher than boys. Other analyses were done by computing the per cent in each reading grade placement classifi- cation who scored high, low, or average on the other measures. Of the 32 children rated high in grade placement, 75 per cent had scored high on letter recognition and 78 per cent scored high on the SAT. Of the 27 children rated low in grade placement, 78 per cent had scored low in letter recognition and 67 per cent were low on the SAT. Koppman and La Pray (225) formed two experimental groups and a control group in studying the relationship between teacher judgments of reading readiness and pupil performance on four measures of readiness. In addition to the regular kindergarten program, the two experimental groups received either word matching activities or letter matching activities ten minutes a day for 48 days. Both experimental groups were taught by the same teachers. Three socio-economic levels and mature and immature children were repre- sented in each treatment group. Teachers were asked to rate pupils on a five-point scale as to their interest in and knowledge of letters and words. Three experimental tests assessing letter copying, letter knowl- edge, and word matching were given to all pupils at the end of the experimental period. Using quintiserial correlations, ratings given by teachers were compared to scores on the three readiness tests and a total score. Correlation coefficients obtained between teacher ratings and total scores were .68 for the word group, .61 for the letter group, and .23 for the control group. Correlation coefficients between ratings and total test scores by socio-economic levels ranged from .50 to .58. For teacher ratings and total test scores when categorized by maturity, coefficients of correlation were .47 for immature pupils and .56 for mature pupils. Little differences were found in the degree to which teacher ratings predicted readiness by sex. Subjects in Hopkins' and Sitkei's predictive study (184) were lower middle class pupils who were given the Lee-Clark Reading Readiness Test (LCRR) and the California Test of Mental Maturity (CTMM) during the first three weeks of grade one. Performance on these measures was correlated with scores on the Lee-Clark Reading Test: Primary (LCRT) and with end-of-year teacher ratings on a four-category scale. Predictive validity coefficients for the LCRR ex-</page><page sequence="161">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 291 ceeded those for the CTMM for both criterion measures. The CTMM correlated .51 with teacher marks and .54 with LCRT. LCRR scores correlated .57 with teacher marks and .61 with LCRT performance. When a multiple regression using both CTMM and LCRR scores as predictors was performed, the multiple correlation rose from .61 to .67. The authors suggested using the readiness test over the CTMM because the former is shorter, more easily interpreted, and less expensive. Ebbesen (111) researched the ability of kindergarten teach- ers to predict reading achievement in the primary grades. Data were obtained on three groups of kindergarten pupils, entering in con- secutive years. Children were randomly assigned each year to one of three kindergarten rooms. At the end of each year, teachers ranked each pupil on the basis of predicted academic achievement in the primary grades. At the end of first grade, pupils were ranked by total standard score obtained on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT). The same procedure was used for the two groups followed through grade two and the one group followed into third grade. Pearson product-moment coefficients of correlation were computed between teacher ranking and MAT scores. For the first group the coefficients of correlation obtained were: .60 with academic achieve- ment in grade one; .54 with achievement in grade two; and .52, for grade three. For the second group, correlation coefficients of .70 and .68 at the end of grades one and two, respectively, were found. The coefficient of correlation between kindergarten teacher ranking and grade one academic achievement for the third group was .68. All correlation coefficients were statistically significant at or beyond the .01 level of confidence. In a three-year longitudinal study, Hirst (178) studied the relationships of kindergarten measurements of intelligence, readiness, maturity development, creativity, sociometric relationship, physical skills, social-emotional growth, perceptual development, and family background variables with academic achievement. Regression equa- tions were computed on each measurement using achievement at the end of grade one as the dependent variable. New regression equa- tions were computed at the end of first grade using predictor variables from each instrument that correlated at the .05 level or higher with grade one achievement scores. Separate regression equations were computed for boys and girls with reading success in grade one as the criterion. Regression analyses for each of the sexes yielded three types</page><page sequence="162">292 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 of measures according to sensory channels of learning and perform- ance: 1] auditory-visual (intersensory); 2] visual-visual (intrasen- sory); and 3] visual-motor. For males, Numbers, Matching, and Visual 3 were the measures in each respective sensory channel. For females, Information, Matching, and Complete-A-Man were the mea- sures. In addition, for boys, a fourth factor, the titles sub-test from Torrana's Nonverbal Test of Creativity, appeared to be another good predictor with a strong visuo-motor component. The author noted that sex was a predictor variable for first-grade reading achievement, but that different measures were needed to predict for each sex. In their study of predictive measures of reading achievement, Wilson and Anderson (403) collected the following data: C.A. at entrance to grade one; M.A. as measured by the Pintner-Cunningham Group Intelligence Test; and readiness as determined by the Row- Peterson Readiness Test administered early in grade one. Scores obtained on these tests were correlated with scores from the Metro- politan Achievement Tests (MAT) and the Stroud Hieronymus Reading Test at the end of grade one. All previous measures were in turn correlated with scores on the MAT and Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) given at the end of grade two. Readiness test scores showed the highest correlation with end of grade one achievement (.62 with the MAT and .59 with the Stroud). Reading achievement tests given at the end of first grade were the best predictors of second-grade reading achievement. C.A. showed almost no correlation with later achieve- ment. Mortenson (285) used a randomly selected population strati- fied by socio-economic level and sex in his investigation of visual and auditory discrimination tasks at the pre-reading level. The Duncan Socio-Economic Index Scale was employed to determine socio-eco- nomic level. All pupils were given the Clymer-Barrett Prereading Battery during the third week of first grade and the California Short Form Test of Mental Maturity (CTMM) in second grade. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance tests were used to treat the data. Performance on all dependent variables measured on the Clymer- Barrett test and on the CTMM was significantly affected by socio- economic status. Sex was a contributing factor in differences in total auditory and visual discrimination as well as in some of the other dependent variables. Upper socio-economic level subjects performed significantly better than did middle class subjects on most of the dependent variables, and both groups performed significantly better</page><page sequence="163">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 293 than did subjects from lower socio-economic levels on all variables. With intelligence controlled, most of the differences among socio- economic levels still held. A further analysis revealed that the signi- ficant differences in performance could not be attributed to any one occupational level within the three socio-economic levels. In a follow-up of an earlier study, Scott (348) tested further the hypothesis that seriation, ordering by size or orientation of objects, was related to and predictive of achievement at the end of grade two. In addition, the study investigated whether a test of seriation ability administered in kindergarten differentiated grade two children who were experiencing difficulty from those who were not. Children who had been given the Seriation Test in kindergarten were admin- istered the sub-test of the California Achievement Tests (CAT) in February or March of second grade. A cut-off point of .3 of a year above or below grade level on the CAT was used to identify readers who were experiencing difficulty and those who were progressing well. A coefficient of correlation of .59, significant at the .005 level, was obtained between the CAT and the total score on the Seriation Test. A significant (.005) chi square was obtained when the two groups of readers were studied, indicating that the Seriation Test was a good predictor of reading achievement at grade two. Several studies employed factor analysis techniques to de- termine common factors among tests contributing to readiness for learning to read. In order to identify similarities and differences among the sub-tests of two reading readiness tests, Olson and Fitz- gibbon (294) subjected the sub-test scores to a factor analytic treat- ment. In addition to the California Test of Mental Maturity, children were given the Lee-Clark Reading Readiness Tests and the Metropoli- tan Readiness Tests. Intercorrelations among the nine readiness sub- test scores were computed and factors with eigenvalues greater than one were subjected to a varimax rotation. The analysis revealed that the nine sub-tests appeared to be contributing to one general common factor and did not measure separate and distinct factors. The predictive validity of the Clymer-Barrett Prereading Bat- tery (CBP) and its sub-tests was compared with that of the Metro- politan Readiness Tests (MRT) by R. E. Johnson (203). In addition, the research studied the test for sex bias and age bias. The MRT was administered to 402 boys and 414 girls in the spring of the kinder- garten year. Subjects were given the CBP during the sixth week of their first-grade year. The criterion measure of reading achievement,</page><page sequence="164">294 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests, was given in April of grade one. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were used to find the degree of interrelationships among the sub-tests of the two readi- ness tests and the relationship between each readiness sub-test and each achievement sub-test. Multiple regression analysis was employed to determine which sub-test or grouping of sub-tests on the CBP was the best predictor of reading achievement. Data to determine sex and age bias were assessed by a two way analysis of variance. The coeffi- cients of correlation obtained between the total CBP battery and the Recognition of Letters and Discrimination of Beginning Sounds sub- tests were the only two that exceeded .70. The total CBP showed a higher correlation, .62, with the Gates than did the MRT. Of the 41 regression formulas formed from sub-tests of the CBP, only 12 had a correlation of .60 or more with the Vocabulary sub-test of the Gates. A correlation of .59 was obtained between the six sub-tests of the CBP and the Comprehension sub-test on the Gates. The Recognition of Letters sub-test proved the best predictor of achievement on the Gates. No sex biases appeared on the CBP. Older children were found to score significantly higher than younger children, however. Rosen and Ohnmacht (331) used a stratified random samp- ling procedure in identifying their first-grade population. All children were given the following tests: Metropolitan Readiness Tests (MRT); Marianne Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception (FTVP); Bond-Balow-Hoyt New Developmental Reading Tests (NDRT); and the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Test (LTIT). In addition, the Minnesota Scale for Paternal Occupations was used to determine socio-economic levels. The FTVP was given to all children twice. Separate analyses were made by sex. Scores for the 23 variables included in the tests were correlated, and the resulting matrices sub- jected to a principal components analysis using unities in the main diagonal. The six components with latent roots of 1.00 or larger were rotated to the varimax criterion. Although boys and girls were similar in I.Q., social class, readiness, and perceptual measures, girls showed superior average reading achievement. Four factors across male and female analyses demonstrated high congruence. These were general reading achievement, perception readiness, figure ground perception, and specific readiness. Only one research report appeared that dealt with testing of adult subjects. Using a random sample of adult clients at a hospital- based vocational rehabilitation center as subjects, Dickinson, Neubert,</page><page sequence="165">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 295 and McDermott (97) studied the relationship between scores on the Full-Range Picture Vocabulary Test (FRPV) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). Pearson product-moment correlation coef- ficients were computed between FRPV I.Q. scores and the WAIS Verbal, Performance, and Full-Scale I.Q. as well as with the WAIS Vocabulary sub-test raw scores. A coefficient of correlation of .91 was found between the two vocabulary measures. Coefficients of correla- tion between the FRPV and the WAIS Verbal, Performance, and Full- Scale scores were .89, .82, and .87 respectively. Bormuth (46) proposed to determine a set of criterion scores for doze readability tests that would be comparable to criterion scores commonly used in readability measurement. Two versions of a doze test were made from each of the passages on the four forms of the Gray Oral Reading Tests. In addition, comprehension tests were made on each paragraph for each of the four forms of the test. At each grade level, four through six, forty subjects were randomly selected from pupils in a single school. Two of the four paragraphs at each level of difficulty on the Gray Oral were randomly assigned to each subject as doze tests. The complementary set of paragraphs were read by each subject as oral reading tests. Testing was halted when a subject's word recognition rate reached 20 per cent. For the doze tests, pupils were required to complete all paragraphs assigned to him, but no time limitation was placed on completion of the forms. Each subject had a set of doze test scores, a set of word recognition scores, and a set of comprehension test scores, all expressed in per- centage of correct responses. A matching procedure was used to determine the doze score comparable to the criterion scores on the oral reading tests. Cloze test scores of 44 and 57 per cent were found to be comparable to the criterion reference scores of 75 and 95 per cent, respectively, on the oral reading comprehension tests. A doze test score of 54 per cent was found comparable to the inde- pendent level word recognition criterion score of 98 per cent, and a cloze score of 34 compared with the instructional word recognition level criterion of 95 per cent. Spearman rho coefficients of correla- tion calculated between cloze test difficulty ranks and the set of ranks derived from the comprehension and word recognition tests were all of the order of .90 or higher for the various forms of the test. Boyd's (49) study was done to see if there was a develop- mental progression of phonic skills and to determine if it could be charted. Using research reports, teachers' guides, and phonic work-</page><page sequence="166">296 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 books, phonic elements and principles were identified and grouped into 15 sections such as beginning consonants, ending consonants, short vowels, consonant blends, and consonant digraphs. Elements were then combined into nonsense words and placed on individual cards for presentation to the 150 pupils. A median score for each grade was determined for particular groups of elements and a growth curve determined. Most rapid growth occurred in grades two and three with a deceleration thereafter. By the end of grade six, pupils with average reading scores had not yet mastered all the phonic elements included in the test. A chi square statistic was used in determining the signifi- cance of differences between median scores obtained at each grade level. Highly significant gains were achieved at successive grade levels for fourteen of the sub-tests. Coates (83) planned and carried out a two-year study of form comparability of the Diagnostic Reading Test (DRT) with junior college students. In the first year, Form C was given at the beginning of the year and Form B at the end of the terms; the order was reversed the following year. In the second year, one group was also given Form D after Form C. All subjects were enrolled in a read- ing technique course and facilities, materials, instruction, and time were held constant. Of the 63 students who took Form C at the end of the term, 65 per cent showed some loss in total comprehension score. Of the 63 subjects who took Form D of the test after Form C, 38 per cent showed a loss in total score. Pearson product-moment coefficients of correlation computed between all forms of the test given on a test-retest basis with instruction intervening showed a range of from .64 to .87. On a test-retest check with no instruction, coefficients of correlation ranged from .53 to .84. The author felt the range of correlations was too wide to warrant the assumption that the tests give equivalent values. Brethower (51) designed a series of three experiments attempting to determine what factors influence gains in rate of comprehension scores other than instruction. In the first experiment, one hundred college students who had voluntarily enrolled in one of six non-credit reading improvement classes were used as subjects. Students were divided into two groups and Part 1 of the Diagnostic Reading Test (DRT) was given under either standardized directions or under directions of artificial time constraints. The latter group was retested with another form of the test administered in the usual manner. Administering the test under a time constraint and then</page><page sequence="167">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 297 under usual conditions resulted in a significantly higher than normal rate of comprehension score. In the second experiment, 24 graduate students were given the DRT first as a pre-test and then an alternate form under time constraints. The reading comprehension scores of 22 of the subjects increased by an average of 82 words per minute while comprehension dropped an average of 6 per cent under the time constraint conditions. Experiment three involved 13 college students and 21 adults who were given a pre-test and two post-tests following instructions. The second post-test directions instructed sub- jects to read as they normally read in class. Reading comprehension gain under pre-test and post-test conditions was 93 per cent. Under pre-test post post-test conditions an average gain of 131 per cent was made. The author pointed out that changes in instructions and changes in conditions immediately prior to taking a test both influ- enced results. Otto and Rarick (301) sought to determine whether there was an optimum time for transition from manuscript to cursive writing in terms of subsequent performance in handwriting, spelling, and reading. A total of 12 districts were randomly selected in which the transition to cursive writing was made at one of four times: first semester, grade two; second semester, grade two; first semester, grade three; second semester, grade three. Each district randomly selected five boys and five girls from grades four and six respectively for a total of 240 subjects. All children were given the reading and spelling sub-tests of the California Achievement Tests, Elementary. Speed and legibility of handwriting were assessed by having a timed writing task rated by three judges. Mean reading scores revealed no significant transition time effect. Time of transition was associated only with handwriting performance in that late transition was associated with rapid writing and early transition, with legibility. Beggs and Hieronymus (30) collected data to test the assumption that reading growth occurred uniformly throughout the year. Administrations of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills were conducted in January, April, and October. In addition, May and September test- ings gave data on the nature of summer growth. The school year phase of the sampling was conducted in grades three to four, four to five, and five to six. The summer phase was conducted in grades five and six only. Grade equivalents and percentile ranks were determ- ined for both the expected and the observed distributions. Differences between the expected and obtained scores were then noted. Of the</page><page sequence="168">298 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 33 medians obtained in October and in April, 12 of the October ones and 17 of the April ones were significantly different from expecta- tions. In the summer phase, 5 of the 22 differences in sub-test medians were significantly different from expectations. The authors concluded that, on the whole, assumptions that one tenth of yearly growth occurs during each month of the school year was open to question. VI. Reading of atypical learners The reports this year dealt only with the mentally retarded and the blind. Kaufman and Ivanoff (209) compared the use of the Pea- body Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), and the Reading section of the Wide Range Achieve- ment Test (WRAT) as determiners of the functional level of mentally retarded individuals. The subjects were 51 males and females with a mean age of 20.8 years involved in work adjustment programs and previously diagnosed as mentally retarded. All three tests were given to each subject. Coefficients of correlation were cal- culated between all sub-tests and the totals on the WAIS and the PPVT-I.Q. and M.A. as well as the WRAT Reading test. The PPVT- M.A. scores correlated higher with the WAIS than did the I.Q. scores. However the WRAT and WAIS correlation was .504 which suggested to the authors that the WRAT Reading test was preferable to the PPVT in ascertaining functional level in this population. Kingsley (215) used the Gates Associative Learning Test with 53 subjects, ages 10 to 15, with I.Q.'s from 53 to 76 to determine characteristics which were unique to mental retardates. Analysis of variance showed the main effects of both figure and mode (auditory or visual) of presentation. Within-study comparisons of his popula- tion with higher grade mental defectives, retarded readers, and achieving readers were made using the t test. Significant differences were found on only two sub-tests, A, and A2. Cawley and Goodman (71) administered the SRA Primary Mental Abilities Tests (PMA) and the SRA Achievement Series to an unspecified number of mentally retarded children. Intercorrelation coefficients were calculated. Significant correlations were obtained between reading scores and all PMA sub-tests except space for pri- mary-grade children and for those in the intermediate grades. Reading and arithmetic sub-scores correlated significantly, except for</page><page sequence="169">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 299 computation, at the primary grades and higher coefficients among all sub-tests were obtained at the middle-grade level. Miller and Miller (274) conducted two experiments to test the hypothesis that severely retarded persons must learn that printed words are symbols rather than concrete objects. In the first experi- ment ten subjects, ages 9 to 27, I.Q.'s 40 to 70, learned 9 accentuated and 9 conventionally-presented words. The accentuated presentation consisted of distorting the word to look like its object, then showing the conventional form on flash cards. The words were learned signi- ficantly (.01) faster in the accentuated condition but a test of criterion discrimination among other words showed no significant advantage over the conventional procedure. To eliminate the personal element of the experimenter, a second study used a stroboscopic projector with 38 retarded subjects, ages 9 to 23, I.Q.'s 25 to 75. Half were diagnosed as familial retarded and half as brain-injured. Two measures included: number of words recognized at 5, 10, and 15 trials; and number correctly discriminated in three-word sets. No statistical differences were found between the two types of mentally retarded. The number of words learned favored the accentuated group again but there was no difference between treatment groups on the mean number of words identified in the criterion discrimination sets. Christiansen (76) taught 12 mentally retarded children elaborative language by asking each subject to close his eyes and imagine how the object and the printed word looked as he pro- nounced it. The control group followed similar procedures except they were not instructed to visualize. At the end of 36 half-hour periods of instruction, each subject was retested with ten pictures in which each depicted five or more attributes or actions. The number verbalized on the post-test was compared to the number on the pre-test. Both groups made significant gains, but the group that visualized made significantly greater gain scores than the control group. Garside (138) recorded oral language in structured inter- views and semi-structured play situations to compare children's vocabulary and sentence length with those in two popular basal readers used in England. Total different words used by ESN children (M.A. = 6.0) was 1959; by normal children (C.A. = 6.0), 2012. The latter were slightly more verbose. The 300 words most frequently used by both groups were calculated. Of the 25 to 37 words used in introductory readers, four to eight were not in the first 300; by grade two, 88 of 198 were not in the first 300 of either ESN or normal</page><page sequence="170">300 READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY * Winter 1970 V/2 children. The means of the sentence length of the two sets of readers were longer than those of either the ESN or normal sample in the interview or at play. One study dealt with the reading status and behaviors of blind children who read braille. Lowenfeld, Abel, and Hatlen (247) first reviewed previous research, concluding that many studies were of debatable value because of small numbers of subjects, lack of uniformity in definition of blindness, and differences in the time when Grade 2 braille (contracted words) was used as a beginning medium of instruction. After noting eight changes since a definitive study had been made, the authors sent questionnaires to all known local schools and to all residential schools for blind children. Replies were received from 88 per cent of local schools and 100 per cent of residential schools. A total of 362 questionnaires filled in by 520 teachers yielded answers to ten questions. For example, the majority of both types of schools introduced braille reading early in first grade, although some residential schools began in kindergarten. Some 64 per cent began with whole words and/or sentences while the remainder began with the alphabet. Nearly all used Grade 2 braille from the beginning. About 85 per cent encouraged the use of both hands for reading. About two thirds of residential and one third of local schools encouraged the use of the index fingers of each hand. About half introduced braille writing with reading and the remainder, shortly after reading began. The conclusioln reached was that the two types of schools did not differ significantly in instruction. Reading tests were administered to 100 fourth graders and 100 eighth graders from schools throughout the U.S.A. The STEP Reading sub-test, and the Stanford Achievement Tests, Reading Comprehension, were given along with a student description form. The I.Q.'s reported on the description form ranged from 70 to 120+ with a normal range in the fourth grade and a much higher per cent (54) above 110 at eighth grade. Of special interest was the report that blindness was caused by retrolental fibroplasia in slightly more than half of the pupils at grade four and in 62 to 78 per cent at grade eight. About 70 per cent at fourth grade were blind at birth while over 80 per cent of eighth graders were so characterized. More than half of the pupils read braille with both hands, and in an even flow. More than a third read avidly and about a half read occasionally. Avid braille readers scored superior on tests. Reading comprehension of blind children was equal to that of the norms of seeing children at fourth</page><page sequence="171">Summary of reading research WEINTRAUB, et al. 301 grade and superior at eighth grade. However, reading rate continued to be about half that of seeing students. The remainder of the book suggested applications of the information gained in the study. Koelsch (220) examined five sets of basal readers for interest and readability levels to be used with educable mentally retarded children. Each book was at grade 3.1 and application of the Spache readability formula resulted in equal scores for the five. To match interests, the California State College interest inventory was given to a group of 18 mentally retarded with mean C.A. of 13.11 and reading level of 3.6. Stories in the basal readers were assigned to the same categories as appeared on the reading interest part of the inventory. Lindquist's method of dichotomous responses revealed that differences were significant. The chi square was applied to each category of story in the basal readers. Results showed significant differences (.01) among the five series.</page><page sequence="172">Annotated bibliography' 1. AARON, I. E. Research in reading and language-elementary grades.
