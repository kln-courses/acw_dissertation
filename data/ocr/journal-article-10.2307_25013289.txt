<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND COMMENTS The National Council Welfare Conference has made available in a small brochure (pp. 22) the two discourses of His Excellency, the Apostolic Delegate, the Most Reverend Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, entitled: The Holy Father and Catholic Action (October 1, 1933), and the National Council of Catholic Women (October 10,1933). Professor Jeremiah D. M. Ford of the Department of Romance Lan? guages at Harvard University, first vice-president of the American Catholic Historical Association, received the honorary degree of L. H. D. from Trinity College, Dublin, on July 5. Dr. Ford was also recently elected vice-president of the Medieval Academy. The Very Rev. Edward V. Cardinal, C. S. V., Ph. D., former student at Catholic University and the University of Illinois, and an active member of the Association, has been appointed president of St. Viator College, Bourbonnais, 111., where for some years he has been professor of history. The College Examination Board has appointed a commission to revise the entrance examination in history. The chairman of the commission invites all who have any ideas on the subject, especially secondary school teachers, to communicate with the secretary, Miss Evelyn P. Braun, Ben? nett Hall, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. It will be quite pertinent in this connection to consider history in its broadest sense, and to raise such questions as the desirability of including within the scope of history the related cultural and social studies. At the advanced age of four-score and three and in the midst of his literary labors, Rev. Zephyrin Engelhardt, O.F.M., one of our leading Catholic historians, departed this life on April 27. He was born on November 13, 1851, at Bilshausen, Province of Hanover, Germany. He was a year old when he came with his parents to the United States. In 1872 he entered the Franciscan Order and six years later, after finishing the prescribed courses in philosophy and theology, he was ordained priest. For almost half a century, with a zeal and energy that bordered on the heroic, Father Engelhardt consecrated himself to the study and writing of the mission history of North America. Actual contact with the Indians, among whom he labored as missionary for more than three decades, gave him a fine understanding and a correct appreciation of the many problems that beset the path of the American pioneers of the Faith ; while his innate talent for historical research and criticism, fortified by an unyielding 203</page><page sequence="2">204 " NOTES AND COMMENTS passion for historical truth and accuracy, on the one hand supplied in large measure lack of scientific training in his chosen field and on the other hand secured for his writings those qualities of historical scholarship that ensure reliability and create confidence. These traits of the man and the scholar apply chiefly to his numerous works on the California missions? the field in which he labored forty years and came to be universally re? garded as our leading authority. His four huge tomes entitled Missions and Missionaries of California, and his series of volumes dealing with the local history of the California missions will always be treasured as a basic source of information and referred to as the standard authority by students of this particular phase of Hispanic-American history. The following list of his California volumes show how justly he has been styled the " Historian of the Padres": The Franciscans in California, 1897; The Franciscans in Arizona, 1899; Missions and Missionaries of California (four volumes with separate Index volume), 1908-1915; The Holy Man of Santa Clara, 1909 ; Vida del P. Mag?n C?tala, 1910 ; Mission San Diego, 1920 ; Mission San Luis Rey, 1921; Mission San Juan Capistrano, 1922; Mission San Gabriel, 1927; Mission San Fernando, 1927; Mission Santa Barbara, 1923; Mission San Francisco, 1924; Missions San Miguel, San Antonio, and Soledad, 1928; Mission San Buenaventura, 1930; Mission San Juan Bautista, 1931; Missions Santa Inez and Purisima Concepci?n, 1932; Mission San Luis Obispo, 1933. Only four days before death cut short the labor that he loved so well, Father Engelhardt was at his desk correct? ing proof sheets for the sixteenth of his local histories, that of Mission San Carlos. He died " in harness," as he had long hoped and prayed for. Characteristic of him were the last words he spoke from his sickbed to his assistant: "How's the work?" He is resting now in the vault of Santa Barbara Mission, where some of those heroes are buried whose achievements in the distant past as missionaries were for so many years the subject of his own achievements as historian. (Francis Borgia Steck, O. F. M.) The Stimmen der Zeit for April, 1934, contains a short but important article on the value of Church statistics by the editor of the Kirchliches Handbuch, Father Hermann A. Krose, S. J., in which he develops canon 470 of the Code. There has finally appeared in France a counterpart of the Catholic Directory. It is VAnnuaire g?n?ral du clerg?, de l'Enseignement et des Oeuvres Catholiques en France (Lethielleux). This annual, established with the collaboration of the hierarchy of France, gives by dioceses and parishes the list of the members of the clergy, a directory of educational establishments of all grades, with the names of the teachers attached to</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND COMMENTS 205 them, and a guide to religious communities and religious works of all kinds established in each parish of France. Montalembert's Pr?cis oVhistoire monastique, des origines ? la fin du XIe si?cle, revised and brought up to date by the Benedictines of Oosterhout, was published during April by J. Vrin, Paris. The Separated Eastern Churches, by Rev. P?re Janin, has been trans? lated by the Very Rev. Canon P. Boylan (Sands). A History of the Franciscan Order, based upon original sources, is being written by the Very Rev. Dr. Raphael Huber, O. M. Conv., professor of Church history, Rome. The work is planned for four volumes : the first to cover the general history of the Order from the days of St. Francis (1181) to the division under Leo X (1517) ; the second to trace the history of the four major branches (Observants, Riformati, Recollects, and Discalced) from 1517 to their reunion under Leo XIII (1897) and down to the present era ; the third to treat the history of the Conventuals, after the division in 1517, to the present; and the final volume to be devoted to the history of the Capuchins from 1528. The work, begun some twenty-five years ago, will probably be finished by the end of the year. Publishers and others interested in the project may communicate with the author at Piazza Scossacavalli 145, Rome, Italy. Three volumes by L?on Homo have already appeared in the " Biblioth?que Historique " of Payot, Paris. The fourth by the same author has recently been published. It is Rome M?di?vale (476-1420) : Histoire, civilisation vestiges (328 pp.) The fall of the Roman Empire of the West in 476 did not seal the tomb of Roman imperialism. The imperialism of the Caesars gave way to Christian imperialism. In spite of the trials of the medieval period, medieval Rome carried on the tradition of antique Rome. A study of the thousand years between the fifth and the fifteenth centuries, in the fields of civilization, literature, art and institutions of Rome, results in an interesting volume of real merit. Paul Fargues has recently published from the presses of Fischbacher, Paris, the third volume of his Histoire du Christianisme. Divided into three parts, it treats of the Middle Ages from 814-1073, from 1073-1294, and from 1294-1450. The Church and the Jews in the Thirteenth Century, by Dr. Solomon Grayzel, is a study of these relations, 1198-1254, based on the papal letters and the conciliar decrees of the period (Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning, Philadelphia, pp. 377). The professor of ecclesiastical history at L'Institut Catholique, Paris,</page><page sequence="4">206 notes and comments H. X. Arquilli?re, is the author of Saint Gr?goire VII. Essai sur la Con ception du Pouvoir pontifical (Vrin, Paris). The April number of Collectanea Franciscana prints two sermons of Fr. Raymond Gaufredi, preached at Oxford in 1291, with an introductory note by A. G. Little; "J?r?me de Sorbo, illumin? de Pa?enne et S. Laurent de Brindes en Belgique (1598-1602)," by P. Hildebrand, O.M.Cap.; "Il Cardinale Antonio Barberini Seniore, O. M. Cap. (1569-1646)," by P. Sisto da Pisa, O. M. Cap. ; and there are the usual notes and miscellany, with lists of Franciscan writings and Franciscan bibliography. Boniface the Eighth, 1294-1303, by T. S. R. Boase (Constable, pp. 397), is a recent addition to the series, Makers of the Middle Ages. The sixteenth volume of Louis von Pastor's Histoire des Papes, depuis la fin du Moyen Age (Pion) appeared during May. J. Webert has added another volume to Deno?l et Steele's collection "Les Ma?tres de la Pens?e Religieuse." The title of this most recent addition is Saint Thomas d'Aquin, le g?nie de Vordre (275 pp.). The Renaissance and the Reformation, by Professor Henry S. Lucas, is intended for college class use (Harper). Erasme et les D?buts de la R?forme fran?aise (1517-1536) is the title of a recent study by Margaret Mann. Champion, Paris, are the publishers. No. 6 of the Yale Studies in Religion is the Attitude of Wolfgang Musculus toward Religious Tolerance, by Dr. Paul J. Schwab (pp. 63). The Catholic Truth Society's list has been enriched by the following new pamphlets: Blessed Thomas More, by Mgr. P. E. Hallett; a guide to Glastonbury Abbey, by the Very Rev. Ethelbert Home; and three addi? tions to its Studies in Comparative Religion : The Conversion of the Roman Empire and the Church in the Christian Roman Empire, both by the Rev. Philip Hughes; and the Eastern Churches, by Donald Attwater. The contents of the April number of the Revue d'Histoire Eccl?siastique include: "Les ?bionites baptistes," by J. Thomas; "La soci?t? letr?e de Londres observ?e par un ?crivain fran?ais en 1839: journal in?dit de Fran?ois Rio," contributed by L. Gougaud ; and " Les d?buts de l'occupation fran?aise ? Rome en 1849, d'apr?s une correspondance in?dite," contributed by G. Mollat. Mlle P. de Lallemand has published, with an introduction by Georges Goyau, a collection of sixty-four new Lettres de Montalembert ? La Mennais (Paris, Descl?e, 1933, pp. 321), which throw light on the history of a</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND COMMENTS 207 famous friendship and its rupture, and indeed on the whole Liberal Catholic movement of the 1830's both in France and in Germany. St. Jeanne d'Arc remains a splendid subject for biographical studies, if we may judge from the number of works now appearing which are centered about her life. The most recent are Une nouvelle affaire Jeanne d'Arc (Librairie Centrale) by S. Fort, and a French edition of Hilaire Belloc's Jeanne d'Arc (Firmin-Didot). Two volumes of recent ecclesiastical history have been published by Plon. One is the memoirs of a French diplomat at Rome, Baron Beyens, and is entitled Quatre ans ? Rome, 1921-1926. Fin du Pontificat de Benoist XV. Pie XI. Les d?buts du fascisme (308 pp.). The second volume is from the pen of Pierre Lyautey, Cardinal Lucon, archev?que de Reims (1842-1930) (240 pp.). Among recent biographies of religious characters are the following: Sainte Th?r?se de Lisieux, Protectrice des peuples (Edit, du Lys), by Albert de Pouvourville; Sainte Bernadette de Lourdes (Flammarion), by Marie Gasquet; Le Cardinal Mercier devant VAllemagne (Flammarion), by Georges Goyau; L}Apprenti missionaire Ch?rubin Mer olla (1910-1930) (Lethielleux), by R. P. de Ruggiero; Monseigneur Mignot (BloudetGay), by L. de Laeger; L'Abb? Georges Fr?mont (Bloud et Gay), by Charles J. Alleaume; and Un Ange du Carmel: Sainte Th?r?se-Marguerite du Sacr? Coeur (Vitte), by R. P. Stanislas de Sainte-Th?r?se. Sainte Th?r?se et la vie mystique (275 pp.) comes from the pens of J. D. Berrueta and Jacques Chevalier. It is an admirable biography of the great Spanish mystic, and includes an excellent expos? of her thought. The publishers are Deno?l et Steele, Paris. Saint Ignatius of Loyola is perhaps one of the least known of the great saints whose influence was profound and far-reaching. Paul Dudon, S. J., has taken a long step towards remedying this situation with his excellently documented Saint Ignace de Loyola (664 pp.), published by Beauchesne, Paris. We are happy to announce that we have begun exchanging with Bohoslovia, i. e., Theology, a quarterly published by the Theological Society of the Greek Uniat Church in the Ruthenian language in the city of Lwow (Lemberg), Poland. The periodical is known for its uniformly high level of scientific and literary excellence. The present number, which is No. 1 of vol. XII, 1934, features an article on Canon Law in Latin by Dr. Basil Baran, entitled: "De ortu et iuribus vicarii generalise which is to be continued. Dr. I. Spytkovskyj contributes another installment of his</page><page sequence="6">208 NOTES AND COMMENTS paper on the Szeptycki Family and their Coat of Arms. It also will be continued in a subsequent number. One may note that the present in? cumbent of the Ruthenian Archi?piscopal See of Lwow is a member of that historic family. The first part of a contribution by Dr. Nicholas Rusnak, entitled : " The Liturgical Books of the Eastern Church on the Primacy of the Pope" also appears in this number. Further sections of the review are devoted to selected questions or analecta, book reviews, a chronicle, proceedings of the Theological Society, and brief notices of books and periodicals. H. M. Stationery Office, London, has issued Vol. XII of the Papal Registers (1458-1471). The calendar deals with the contents of the Lateran Registers of Pius II and the Vatican and Lateran Registers of Paul II, and relates especially to Scottish and Irish affairs. The supplement to the February issue of the Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research contains particulars of historical theses completed, 1932-1933, and in progress, 1933-1934, in the universities and university colleges of the United Kingdom. Many titles of Catholic interest are listed. The April number of the English Historical Review brings the conclusion of the interesting articles by Professor Harold Temperley on " Stratford de Redeliffe and the Origins of the Crimean War" (XLVIII, 601-21; XLIX, 265-98). Based on Austrian, Dutch, and especially British archives (the Stratford and Clarendon MSS.), these articles tend to show, in con? trast to views hitherto current, that " the great Elchi " worked for peace far more consistently and tenaciously than he has been given credit for; that he was less anti-Russian than his predecessor at Constantinople or Sir H. Seymour at St. Petersburg; that he was far from being a kind of dictator at Constantinople, playing off the Turks against his own govern? ment and all the other Powers of Europe. The real root of the trouble was chauvinism in England, Russia, and especially Turkey. Another contribution of value in the same field is the article by G. B. Henderson on " The Seymour Conversations, 1853 " in History, October, 1933 (N. S., XVIII, pp. 241-47). "A study of these negotiations does not reveal the Czar as a plotter: it reveals him as a blunderer, whose blunders were equalled by those of the British ministers." Professor James A. M?ller of the Episcopal Theological School of Cambridge (Mass.) has supplemented his biography of the great Bishop of Winchester (1926) by a volume of the Letters of Stephen Gardiner (Cambridge, University Press, 1933, pp. 573). Containing 173 letters, of which only 75 had previously been published, this work should be of</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND COMMENTS 209 material assistance towards the understanding of a man who did so much to tear England away from Rome under Henry VIII and to bring her back to the Roman obedience under Queen Mary. The first annual meeting of the Canadian Catholic Historical Association was held in Ottawa, May 29, 30. On the first day there was a luncheon conference at which was discussed the Teaching of History in Catholic Colleges and Seminaries; and a general session at which the following papers were read : " Dante, the Poet of the Liturgy," by Dr. Mary Manley; "The Utopia of Blessed Thomas More," by the Rev. John B. O'Reilly; "L'une des sources de l'apostolat canadien-fran?ais," by the Very Rev. Canon Emile Chartier; and "Father John McKenna, Loyalist Chaplain," by the Rev. Edward Kelly. On the second day the luncheon conference was on the work of the Association's Committee on Archives. The papers of the afternoon's session were : " La mission de John Carroll au Canada en 1776 et l'interdit du P. Floquet," by the Rev. Thomas M. Charland, O.P.; "The Hon. James Baby, Loyalist, First Catholic Member of the Executive Council of Upper Canada," by the Rev. Brother Alfred, F. S. C. ; " Libert? des cultes au Canada," by the Hon. Jean Fran?ois Pouliot ; and " Contemporary Recovery Policies against the Historical Background of Catholic Economic and Social Theory," by Dr. John J. Connolly. At the annual dinner which brought the meeting to a close the presidential address was read by the Hon. F. R. Latchford, first president of the association. Bulletin No. 21 (March) of the American Council of Learned Societies is devoted entirely to a List of American Periodicals and Serial Publications in the Humanities and Social Sciences, compiled by Dr. Leo F. Stock (pp. 130). This list supplements Dr. Stock's List of American Journals de? voted to the Humanistic and Social Sciences, first issued by the Council in 1925 and revised to 1928. Following the main list there is presented a classified list of the periodicals and serials described, arranged under six? teen heads in accordance with the fields covered by the publications. Copies will be sent by the American Council of Learned Societies, 907 Fifteenth St., N. W., Washington, D. C, upon receipt of twenty-five cents in stamps. Ren? Menard, 1605-1661, by Alexander McG. Steward, is a study of the life of Father Menard which was prepared in connection with the naming of a state highway bridge over the Seneca River (Rochester, pp. 76). Some account of Bishop Baraga's missionary work is given in a biography by Franc Jaklic, Misijonski skof irenej Friderik Baraga. An article in the same language, "Baraga ap?stol tresnosti," is contributed by Hugo Bren to the January issue of Ave Maria, published by the Slovene Franciscans at Lemont, 111.</page><page sequence="8">210 NOTES AND COMMENTS Transcripts of fifteen letters written by the Indian missionary, Fr. Francis Pierz, between 1835-1840, have been made for the Minnesota Historical Society from originals in the parish archives of Krainburg, Jugoslavia. These letters, written to friends in his native land, describe his mission work in the Northwest, his impressions of native land, and his travels along the north shore of Lake Superior. The magazine section of the St. Paul Daily News for January 14 con? tains a description of Bishop Cretin's early experiences in America as revealed in his letters to his sister in France. Historical Essays, No. 10, issued by St. Meinrad Seminary, Ind., lists the following contents : Indiana in 1834, by William Mullenholz ; Catholi? cism in Indiana prior to 1834; Vincennes in 1834, by Patrick Kilfoil; the First Priest of Bishop Brute (Simon P. Lalumi?re), by John Casey; Simon Brute de R?mur, 1834-1839, by Thomas Clarke; Celestine de la Hailandi?re, Second Bishop of Vincennes, by John Kraka; John Stephen Bazin, Third Bishop of Vincennes, by Paul Maloney; Maurice de St. Palais, Fourth Bishop of Vincennes, by Daniel Nolan; Francis Silas Chatard, First Bishop of Indianapolis, by Bernard Strange; Joseph Chartrand, Second Bishop of Indianapolis, by Richard Langen; and the Priests of Vincennes-Indianapolis, 1859, 1884, 1909, by Francis Heiligen? stein. Appended to an anonymous article entitled, " Catholicism or Slavery : Which ? " appearing in the April number of Tyler's Quarterly Historical and Genealogical Magazine, is a letter, dated June 5, 1856, from Samuel Lumsden, Irish merchant of Milwaukee, to Robert Tyler, a Pennsylvania politician who, though a Protestant, became president of the Irish Repeal Association. The Minutes of the 16th regular meeting of the Texas Knights of Columbus Historical Commission, held in Austin, May 16, contains (among other interesting matter) the report of the Rev. Dr. Paul J. Foik, C. S. C, chairman of the commission. In spite of diminished financial support it is expected that two volumes of the Mission Era in Texas (to 1745) will be ready for publication by the end of 1934. Dr. Carlos E. Casta?eda was appointed historiographer in place of the Rev. Dr. Francis Borgia Steck, O. F. M., who resigned to accept a lectureship at the Catholic University of America. Dr. Casta?eda will finish the work on the mission period ; an historiographer of the modern period will not be selected until the accumulation of materials has made further progress. As a supplement to the April number of the American Historical Review there is printed a List of Research Projects in History, exclusive</page><page sequence="9">NOTES AND COMMENTS 211 of doctoral dissertations, now in progress in the United States and Canada (pp. 54), which contains 817 titles of works designated as contemplated, in progress, finished, in press, or published. There seems to be little pur? pose in including some 30 topics which are merely " contemplated " ; this " paper blockade " of particular territory should have no effect upon another scholar equipped and ready to enter the field. It will be interest? ing to note ten years hence how many of the projects " contemplated " or " in progress " will have found their way into print. This List offers interesting commentary on purely Catholic topics which non-Catholic his? torians have elected to study and which for some reason have never attracted the attention of Catholic historians who should be able to treat the subjects more satisfactorily. In the March issue of the Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia will be found an article by Dr. Elizabeth S. Kite on Lafayette and His Companions on the Victoire ; the third part of Father Francis E. Tourscher's history of Old Saint Augustine's in Philadelphia and its Missions; the address delivered before the society by Dr. John J. Meng, entitled, "Philadelphia Welcomes America's First Foreign Repre? sentative (Gerard) "; and a continuation of Francis Furey's study of the Beginning of Hawaiian Vicariate. The leading article in the April number of Mid-America is a study of Early Plans for the German Catholic Colonization of Texas, by the Rev. Dr. Paul J. Foik, C. S. C. John F. McDermott, under the title, "Paincourt and Poverty," refutes the charge that early St. Louis was poverty stricken; Father Raymond Corrigan, S. J., contributes to the Maryland Tercentenary a worthy article on Maryland, Cradle of Religious Liberty; Sister Mary Celeste, R. S. M., writes of the Miami Indians prior to 1700 ; and Pierre Georges Roy sponsors some documents concerning the genealogy of the American Fr?monts. The May issue of the Historical Bulletin prints a timely article on Vin? cennes, 1834-1934, by Thomas F. O'Connor; a discussion of the Kensing? ton Stone, by Francis S. Betten, S. J. ; a study of the Anthropomorphic Gods in Roman Religion, by George C. Ring, S. J.; the second part of the Apaches as a Spanish Frontier Problem, by John F. Bannon, S. J. ; a list of historical fiction, compiled by Allan P. Farrell, S. J. ; and a statement of an historical problem on the Spanish Armada, contributed by Herman J. M?ller, S. J. Sociology was the subject of the sixteenth annual meeting of the Fran? ciscan Educational Conference, held at Hinsdale, 111., June 28-30. But there was an historical paper on the Franciscans and Social Activities,</page><page sequence="10">212 ^OTES AND COMMENTS read by the Rev. Victor Mills, O.F.M., in connection with which there were general discussions of Social Conditions in the Thirteenth Century; St. Francis, Social Reformer; the Friars and the Montes Pietatis of the Fifteenth Century; and the Third Order and Feudalism.
