Hurwitz University of Virginia N. Khaewpong and R. Eppinger National Highway Traffic Safety Administration E. Sun Conrad Technologies ABSTRACT Recently there has been a greater awareness of the increased risk of certain injuries associated with air bag deployment, especially the risks to small occupants, often women. These injuries include serious eye and upper extremity injuries and even fatalities. This study investigates the interaction of a deploying air bag with cadaveric upper extremities in a typical driving posture; testing concentrates on female occupants. The goals of this investigation are to determine the risk of upper extremity injury caused by primary contact with a deploying air bag and to elucidate the mechanisms of these upper extremity injuries. Five air bags were used that are representative of a wide range of air bag 'aggressivities' in the current automobile fleet. This air bag 'aggressivity' was quantified using the response of a dummy forearm under air bag deployment. For this study, sixteen excised cadaveric upper extremities were mounted to a four degree-of-freedom universal joint that functioned as a shoulder. The upper extremity position was a 'natural' driving posture in a one- hand turn crossover maneuver. In this posture, the forearm was pronated with the humerus normal to the plane of the steering wheel and the forearm positioned directly on the air bag module so that the distal third of the forearm was over the air bag tear seam. This position represents a 'worst case' for deployment of an air bag into a forearm. Injuries sustained during testing included ulna nightstick fractures and multiple fractures. A nightstick fracture is a diaphaseal ulna fracture unaccompanied by a radius fracture [1]. The results indicate that the air bag/flap interaction may be significant in the production of some injuries, but is not necessary to produce peak moments in the forearm. These primary contact injuries occurred within 13 ms of the deployment near the site of interaction with the flap. In addition, these results show that the risk of injury increases with increasing air bag aggressivity. The testing also suggests that there is an aggressivity among those air bags installed in the current automobile fleet below which the risk of forearm injury for occupants is low. Further, the results imply that there is a forearm bone strength above which the risk of injury is low even for an aggressive air bag deployment. Results also suggest that humerus position, forearm pronation angle, and forearm position relative to the air bag module affect the risk of injury from air bag deployment. Comparison tests were performed with the SAE 5th Percentile Female Instrumented Arm using four of the air bags tested in the cadaveric series. These tests were performed using the SAE arm mounted on a Hybrid III dummy and the universal joint test fixture. Repeated tests revealed no significant difference between the forearm response on the fixture and on the dummy. Resulting forearm moments were used to develop logistic injury risk functions for ulna and ulna/radius fractures of female forearms in the worst case position under air bag deployment. For 50% risk of ulna or ulna/radius fractures, the dummy forearm moment is 61 N-m (+/- 13 N-m standard deviation). For 50% risk of fracture of both the ulna and the radius, the dummy forearm moment is 91 N-m (+/- 14 N-m standard deviation). INTRODUCTION Although the use of air bag systems as supplemental restraints has significantly decreased the risk of fatality in automobile collisions, there is evidence of increased risk of non-fatal injuries including burns, abrasions, and eye injuries owing to air bag deployment. In addition, case studies suggest that upper extremity injuries, including severe fractures, may be caused by air bag deployment [c.f. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6]. In a 1996 NHTSA Report to Congress [7], an analysis of crash test data suggests that there may be a 40% increase in risk of serious (AIS 3) upper extremity injury to belted occupants with airbags. Kuppa et. al. analyzed several crash databases to determine incidence of upper extremity injuries for crashes with and without a driver-side air bag deployment [8]. They found that 1.1% of drivers who were restrained only by a seat belt experienced an upper extremity 3644</page><page sequence="2">injury. In contrast, 4.4% of drivers experienced upper extremity injuries in the presence of a deploying air bag. Two modes of injury have been suggested to explain this increased incidence of upper extremity injuries with air bag deployment. The first type is a flinging type of injury in which the air bag propels the upper extremity into an object in the vehicle (e.g. b-pillar, roof, occupant's head). The second type is primary contact with the air bag or air bag flap; this injury may occur, for example, while executing a left turn with a continuous motion of the right hand, placing the forearm directly over the module. Flinging injuries are complicated functions of upper extremity interaction with the air bag/module, occupant thorax and head, and automobile interior geometry. In contrast, primary contact injuries may be investigated using a simple 'worst case' model that is a function of occupant position and air bag/module characteristics only. So, primary contact injuries are the subject of the current study. A demonstration of the current and future magnitude of the upper extremity/air bag injury problem is shown in Figure J. For AIS-2 or AIS-3 upper extremity injuries, including fractures of varying severity but excluding all skin injuries, the incidence of injury rose from essentially zero in 1988 to nearly three per day in 1995. In 1996, an estimated 30% of passenger cars in the automobile fleet had driver-side air bags. By the year 2000, under current regulations, this percentage climbs to 50% and increases in succeeding years. So, with no change in air bag characteristics, the incidence of upper extremity injury owing to air bag deployment is expected to increase correspondingly. These projections do not include effects of air bag depowering under current and proposed regulations. Significant fleetwide depowering should have a beneficial effect on the rate of primary contact injuries. Figure 1: Upper Extremity Injuries Owing to Driver-Side Air Bag Deployment (Bar Graph) Compared With the Number of Cars With Driver-Side Air Bags (Shaded Area) Existing case studies of upper extremity/air bag injuries provide a strong indication of the etiology of such injuries, specifically primary contact injuries. The archetypal case for the current study was reported by Huelke et al [4]. In this case, a 75 year old woman driving a Mercury Grand Marquis executing a left turn with her right hand was involved in a collision and subsequent air bag deployment. She suffered multiple segmental fractures of the right radius and ulna, including the proximal and distal ulna. In addition, the driver also sustained a circumferential degloving laceration involving both skin and subcutaneous tissue. Blood spatter patterns in the interior of the vehicle suggested that the hard tissue injuries occurred as the result of primary contact with the air bag. Case studies and NASS data suggest that these severe upper extremity injuries occur predominantly in women. It may be hypothesized that this represents the effects of three factors: 1) as women are generally shorter in stature than men, they drive closer to the steering wheel/air bag module, 2) women experience an age-related loss of bone mineral density, and 3) women have generally smaller bones and, hence, lower ultimate bone strength. To investigate the upper extremity/air bag interactions causing these injuries, Saul et al used an instrumented Hybrid III upper extremity to examine injury from direct contact [9]. Using strain gauges and accelerometers, they found that bending moments and accelerations of the forearm could be accurately recorded. Moreover, a correlation was found between these values and the air bag's inflator properties, flap, and steering wheel orientation. In addition, the Research Arm Injuiy Device (RAID) was developed by Conrad Technologies Inc. and NHTSA to investigate the interaction between a deploying air bag and an upper extremity in close proximity to the air bag [8]. They found that the two most significant determinants of peak measured bending moment were the orientation of the forearm with respect to the air bag module and the separation distance between the two. Maximum moments were recorded when the forearm was positioned perpendicular to the air bag module. This situation occurs, for example, when making a left turn with the right hand. In this situation, the sides of the air bag are at the 1 and 7 o'clock positions, while the hand and elbow are at the 10 and 4 o'clock positions respectively. The maximum moments also decreased as the distance between the air bag and the forearm was increased from 1.3 cm to 7.6 cm. It is likely that a specific air bag design is developed with a view toward total restraint system effectiveness. As different passenger automobiles have different physical sizes and stiffness, this results in installed air bags of different deployment properties (e.g. pressure-time histories, module design, deployment characteristics) among vehicle models. Five Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) air bag types were used in this study; these air bags were identified using RAID testing as representing a wide range of aggressivities in the current passenger car fleet. Using a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) coding scheme, these systems are termed System H, System K, System J, System L, and System T air bags. The System H and System K air bags produce relatively more aggressive air bag deployments, the System J air bag produces a moderately aggressive deployment, and the System L and System T air bags produce relatively less aggressive deployments. In addition, the System H air bag has been identified in case studies as producing primary contact upper extremity injuries under certain circumstances. 3645</page><page sequence="3">The principal goal of this study is to determine if these primary contact injuries can be reproduced in a laboratory setting using OEM air bag systems. In addition, this study quantifies the dynamic and injury response of cadaveric upper extremities under air bag deployment in a 'worst-case' position. Also, the study investigates factors that affect injuries in cadaveric upper extremities and develops a correlation of these injuries with dummy response using the SAE 5th Percentile Instrumented Arm. As there are a number of design factors that may influence the upper extremity injury potential of a given air bag, including inflator properties, air bag properties, and module properties, we have chosen to focus on dummy and cadaveric response criteria as the most effective measure of injury risk. The testing was performed in two major parts. The first includes three series of cadaveric tests: air bag deployments into upper extremities intact on whole cadavers, deployments into excised upper extremities mounted in a test fixture, and drop tests into a pronated and supinated forearm. The second part is comprised of dummy testing. In these tests, we study the deployment of air bags into the SAE Arm mounted on a Hybrid III dummy and attached to the universal joint upper extremity fixture developed for cadaveric studies. CADAVERIC TESTING The cadaveric testing concentrated on female subjects. The tests attempted to attain a 'worst-case' test condition and hence a 'worst-case' response under air bag deployment. The test position selected is roughly a 'natural ' driving position in a one-armed left turn maneuver modified for enhanced repeatability and 'worst-case' behavior. The forearm was fully pronated and placed directly on the air bag module with the forearm oriented perpendicular to the air bag tear seam. The distal third of the forearm was placed over the module tear seam, and the humerus was oriented normal with respect to the plane of the steering wheel. This position represents the 'worst case' or most vulnerable position for four reasons. First, RAID testing indicated that bending moments were maximized when the test device was oriented perpendicular to the air bag tear seam [8]. Second, RAID bending moments under air bag deployment were found to decrease as the test device was moved away from the module. Third, the distal third of the forearm is the weakest location in bending with the lowest combined polar moment of inertia of both the radius and ulna, providing the greatest risk of fracture. Fourth, the humerus oriented normal to the steering wheel provides a support for the forearm under air bag deployment forcing the initial center of forearm rotation to be about the elbow with a relatively long moment arm. Sixteen of twenty cadaveric tests were performed on a universal joint test fixture diagrammed in Figure 2. The fixture is comprised of two components. The first supports the steering wheel/air bag module on a five axis load cell. The second mounts the upper extremity to a four degree-of- freedom universal joint. The excised test limb is attached to the fixture by embedding the proximal humerus in a potting cup using an epoxy solution. Padding was placed in the back of the test fixture to avoid artifactural injuries that are not attributable to primary contact with the air bag. The remaining four of twenty tests were performed on intact cadaveric subjects with minimal instrumentation as discussed below. The instrumentation for the fixture tests includes two strain gauge rosettes that are located on the ulna and two strain gauge rosettes that are located on the radius to measure local strain on the bone surface. These gauges were attached using standard surface preparation and mounting techniques. A five-axis humerus load cell was mounted at the interface between the excised limb and the four degree-of-freedom universal joint at the shoulder. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) angular rate sensors were used to measure the local rotation of the upper extremity at several locations. Uniaxial MHD angular rate sensors were mounted on the distal radius and the proximal ulna; the distal radius angular rate sensor was used to determine pronation/supination of the forearm, and the proximal ulna sensor was used to measure the rotation of the forearm relative to the humerus. A triaxial MHD angular rate sensor was attached to the humerus load cell to measure the rotation of the humerus relative to the fixed laboratory reference frame. In addition, a triaxial accelerometer was mounted to each MHD angular rate sensor. An instrumented cadaveric upper extremity on the test fixture is shown in Figure 3. The reference position for pronation and supination has the forearm perpendicular to the upper arm with a vertical palm, thumb oriented up. Pronation and supination can then be measured from the movement of the palm from its neutral position [10]. One possible objection to the use of the test fixture is that, for experimental convenience, the location of the point about which the shoulder rotates is fixed in space. In a natural driving condition, the shoulder is relatively free to translate in response to forcing. This translationally fixed shoulder was examined using the Articulated Total Body (ATB) lumped-mass simulation program as shown in Figure 4. The figure shows a comparison of the humerus axial force for a subject with a shoulder fixed in translation versus a shoulder free to translate under the action of a deploying air bag. There is little difference in humerus response between the two cases, especially in the crucial initial deployment period. This result justifies using a shoulder that is fixed in translation for the experimental setup. 3646</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2: Upper Extremity/Air Bag Test Fixture - Side View Figure 3: Upper Extremity Mounted in Universal Joint Test Fixture Figure 4: ATB Simulation of Fixed vs. Sliding Shoulder UPPER EXTREMITY AND SUBJECT ANTHROPOMETRY The desired subject population for this study is a set of females. Upper extremities acquired for this study were predominantly female, with 15 female limbs and 3 male limbs. The male limbs were run for the purposes of comparison with the female injury results. The subjects averaged 57 years in age (standard deviation 11.9 years) and 60.2 kg in mass (standard deviation 9.8 kg) as shown in Table 1. Also included in Table 1 is a comparison of the current test population with a reference 5th percentile female and a reference 50th percentile female derived from McConville and Laubach [111.

Individual subject segmental properties are reported in the Appendix. Masses were determined by sectioning the upper extremities post-test or by mass estimation using CT scans. There is less than a 10% difference between CT mass and measured mass of segments where both are available. Reference forearm and hand lengths were derived from an anthropometric study on 1 Estimated using McConville et. al. un 3647</page><page sequence="5">1905 USAF women [11]. Compared with the reference 5th and 50th percentile females, the female subjects in the present population have a mass consistent with a 5th percentile female, but a length consistent with a 50th percentile female. As the average age of the female test subjects is 56 years and there are several elderly subjects, this result may be explained by loss of muscle mass in the extremities. Subject bone parameters derived from CT studies are presented in the Appendix. CT Hounsfield numbers are converted to cortical bone density using a result of McBroom et. al. [12]. Cortical bone densities are shown since the region of fracture is near the distal third of the radius/ulna. Schlenker et al [13] report that the distal third of the radius/ulna is comprised of approximately 97% cortical bone. The average cortical bone density is 1.92 g/cm3 (standard deviation 0.164 g/cm3) for the current test population, a set that includes three male subjects. These results are comparable with radius cortical bone densities found by Ruegsegger et. al. [14] who show 1.86 g/cm3 (standard deviation 0.031 g/cm3) average cortical bone density for healthy older females. Though dynamic tests on human forearms are not abundant in the existing literature, there have been several quasi-static studies of the ultimate strength of isolated radius and ulna in three and four point bending. Studies include those reported by Weber [15], Messerer [16], Yamada [17], Jurist [18], Swanson [19], and UVa as shown in Table 3. The studies by Jurist, Swanson, and UVa report values for embalmed bones. In addition, Jurist, Yamada, and Swanson do not report results divided by male and female populations. So, large standard deviations among ultimate strengths of the ulna and radius reported by Jurist (ulna s.d. = 15.4 N-m) and Swanson (radius s.d. = 16 N-m) are adequately explained by natural variation among a heterogeneous male/female population. The majority of the tests were performed in the anterior/posterior direction. Deriving an average radius and ulna failure moment from the existing data is difficult considering that the tests span over a hundred years with three different national subject populations. In addition, there are considerable differences in test protocol among the six studies. The direction of loading in the cadaveric subject tests with the forearm in the pronated position is initially oriented approximately posterior/anterior on the ulna in the distal third. However, though the pronated radius is initially oriented approximately anterior/posterior in the distal third, the bone orientation changes towards medial/lateral for proximal sections. Considering these caveats on the use of averaged bending data, the average ulna ultimate bending strength for the female/unknown group from all the quasistatic studies is 39 N-m, and the average radius ultimate bending strength is 35 N-m. These averages are taken by weighting each study result by the number of subjects in the study.

These tests used fourteen cadaver upper extremities where three extremities were frozen and thawed and eleven were embalmed. The embalming fluid used is designed to maximize subject biofidelity [20]. Cadavers were obtained through the Virginia State Anatomical Board with permission of the family given to conduct biomechanics research. All test procedures were approved by the Human Use Review Panel (HURP) of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and an institutional review board at the University of Virginia. Screening for Hepatitis A, B, C, and HIV was conducted with each cadaver prior to acceptance into the research program. Five OEM air bags were used in the testing that are representative of a wide range of air bag aggressivities in the current automobile fleet. These air bag systems, in order of decreasing aggressivity are denoted, System K, System H, System J, System L, and System T. There were two upper 3648</page><page sequence="6">extremity/air bag tests using each of the System K, L, and T air bags, three tests using the System H air bag, and four tests using the System J air bag. A test matrix for these tests, 1.1-5.4, is shown in Table 4. The air bags were mounted in original equipment steering wheels appropriate for the air bag tested. All air bags deployed normally except for two of the System K air bags. During the cadaveric test 4.1 and the dummy test discussed later, 6.10, System K air bags suffered large tears during deployment originating at the reinforced seam around the peripheral vent holes. In spite of these holes, the air bag appeared to inflate fully.

Then, the air bag deploys through a tear seam oriented perpendicular to the forearm. As the air bag expands into the distal third of the forearm and the module cover rotates outward, the hand and elbow remain approximately stationary for 3-4 ms after the emergence of the air bag. In cases with primary contact fracture, the fracture is usually identified during this time. Subsequently, the hand begins moving away from the steering wheel under continued expansion of the bag. The forearm flexes toward the upper arm as the elbow adducts towards the center of the steering wheel as the limit of joint flexion is reached. Acceleration time histories suggest that the greatest forces on the forearm occur during the air bag punch-out and shortly thereafter. For the sixteen fixture tests, the forearm injury results are reported in Table 5. Injuries were identified using x-ray and hard tissue necropsy. The table includes fracture time identified from strain gauge data. The System K air bag produced two radius/ulna forearm fractures in two tests, the System H air bag produced two radius/ulna fractures and two ulna fractures in four tests, the System J air bag produced one radius/ulna fracture and one ulna fracture in four tests, and the System L and System T air bags produced no injury. These results are consistent with the previous identification of the System K and the System H air bags as relatively aggressive, the System J air bag as moderately aggressive and 2 Estimated using segmental masses and regression equations from McConville et. al. ini. 3649</page><page sequence="7">the System L and the System T air bags as relatively less aggressive. The time of fracture for the tests with injury are also shown in Table 5. Fracture is identified by a sudden release of strain in multiple strain gauges on a given bone. Qualitatively similar results are seen in drop tests where accurate identification of fracture time can be obtained from load cell data and high speed video analysis. Fracture times were consistently later for the System H air bag than for the System K or System J air bags. This finding is confirmed by forearm moment results from subsequent dummy tests discussed later. Further, for a generic System H deployment, the module cover flap is normal to the plane of the steering wheel by approximately 11 ms resulting in diminished forearm/flap interaction. So, the injuries seen for System H air bag deployments at 12.6, 12.0, 10.8, and 12.1 ms are likely to be predominantly forearm/air bag interactions as opposed to forearm/flap/air bag interactions. Also, owing to the early time of fracture for the System K air bag, the air bag fabric failure in 4.1 is likely to not be significant in decreasing the risk of primary contact injury to the forearm. Additional evidence for early fractures under System J air bag deployment comes from humerus axial load as plotted in Figure 5. Two tests are reported for System J, one with a radius/ulna fracture, one with no fracture. As the humerus axial load in the current test position results largely from the forearm reaching the joint stop, the early ulna/radius fracture results in a significantly delayed peak in humerus axial load. Figure 5: Typical Humerus Axial Loads (Signals Filtered to SAE CFC-600) Radius and ulna maximum strain rates for the tests with injury are also shown in Table 5. Strain rates are determined by the maximum value of strain slope for all available strain gauges before fracture. Typical strain rates range from approximately 1.3 per second to 5.3 per second. Gauge failures prevented the determination of strain rates for the System H test 1.2.

All but one of the ulna fractures occurred distal of the distal third of the forearm, towards the section of minimum polar moment of inertia for the ulna. Also, all of the radius fractures began proximal to the corresponding ulna fracture. This results from the decrease in the polar moment of inertia of the radius as the bone is traversed in the proximal direction. In addition, three of the five radius fractures occurred in close proximity to the initial location of the tear seam on the forearm. The other radius fractures occurred within 16% of the distal third of the forearm. The locations of fractures seen in the fixture tests are similar to those seen in case reports of upper extremity injuries to drivers that are attributed to primary contact injury (c.f.

Individual cortical bone densities for the fixture tests are shown in the Appendix. For example, the System J air bag deployment in 5.2 (ulnar cortical bone density =1.95 gm/cm3) resulted in ulna and radius fracture, but the System J test 5.3 (ulnar cortical bone density = 1.86 gm/cm3) produced no fracture. In contrast, the ulna distal third polar moment of inertia is strongly associated with forearm fracture as shown in Figure 6. The figure plots the polar moment determined from CT scans at the distal third of the ulna against the levels of fracture for five System H deployments with two radius/ulna fractures, two ulna fractures, and one non-fracture deployment. Levels of fracture are also shown for four System J deployments with one radius/ulna fracture, one ulna fracture, and two non- fracture results. It is clear from the graph that lower ulna distal third polar moment of inertia is associated with greater levels of fracture for both series. In addition, the more aggressive System H air bag sees a higher threshold of fracture than the moderately aggressive System J air bag. We conclude that, for the conditions tested, forearm bone polar moment of inertia is a significant contributor to the risk of forearm injury under air bag deployment. 2 ^ ' i ' 1 ?

So, the data from each test series was filtered to SAE CFC- 180 and averaged to produce the acceleration plot in Figure 7. Average peak loads for the more aggressive System K and System H air bag deployments 3 Distal end of fracture, percentage of total length along the forearm from ulna styloid process to olecranon. 3651</page><page sequence="9">were substantially larger than those for System J, System L, and System T. Average peak loads for the systems tested are: System K, 811 g's; System H, 773 g's; System J, 390 g's; System L, 397 g's; and System T, 410 g's. Though two injuries in four tests were produced by System J deployment as compared to none for System L and System T, the average peak resultant acceleration from System J is commensurate with those seen with System L and System T. This difference can be attributed to details of the System J air bag deployment. From high speed video, the System J air bag appears to deploy in a smaller forearm area than the System L or System T air bags. This concentration of air bag deployment may lead to increased risk of fracture to female occupants. Figure 7: Average Distal Forearm Resultant Acceleration (Signals Filtered to SAE CFC-180) Elbow flexion for typical tests derived from the integration of Magnetohydrodynamic Angular Rate sensors (MHDs) is shown in Figure 8. Again, the more aggressive System K air bag shows a larger initial slope, and hence larger forearm velocity, than the other systems tested. In contrast, the slope of the System H air bag is initially similar to System J, System L, and System T, until approximately 10 ms when continuing air bag deployment increases the slope of the flexion time history. This is identified in later dummy testing as the time of peak dummy forearm moments for System H. The large flexion seen in System K in Figure 8 occurs after radius/ulna fracture as the result of increased forearm degrees-of-freedom. Figure 8: Elbow Flexion for All Air Bag Systems 3652</page><page sequence="10">CADAVERIC ATTACHED ARM TESTS A preliminary series of uninstrumented upper extremities intact on whole cadavers, denoted 0.1-0.4, is shown in Table 4. In the tests, two matched pairs of upper extremities were tested under air bag deployment from the relatively aggressive System H air bag and the relatively nonagressive System L air bag. The forearms were positioned on the wheel with fingers on the steering wheel rim, forearm oriented perpendicular to the air bag tear seam. To protect the thorax of the whole cadaveric subjects from air bag impact, the body of the cadaver was positioned to the side of the steering wheel. This resulted in a humerus being oriented in the plane of the steering wheel. No injuries were produced in any of the air bag deployments. Lack of injury in the 0.2-0.3 series of upper extremities under the relatively aggressive System H air bag suggests that there are differences in the dynamic response between the fixture tests and the attached limb tests. On the other hand, simulation results cited earlier suggest that there are minimal differences between the forearm dynamics of an upper extremity mounted to a fixture and an upper extremity attached to a subject in the same position. So, there are three significant differences between the position of the forearm and upper arm between the two series. First, the humerus position was approximately in the plane of the steering wheel. In the fixture tests, the humerus was approximately normal to the steering wheel. This may be hypothesized to produce a 'pylon' effect that may increase moments in the forearm under air bag deployment. Second, the forearm position resulting from the location of the cadaver body is slightly supinated in contrast with the fully pronated position in the fixture tests. Third, the forearms were positioned in the cadaver series so that the fingers wrapped around the steering wheel. This resulted in a more proximal position of the forearm with respect to the air bag tear seam than in the fixture tests. For the fixture tests, the vulnerable distal third of the forearm was placed over the tear seam without regard to the position of the fingers. Each of these factors acts to lower the risk of fracture of the forearm as discussed in the succeeding sections. Effect Of Pronation/Supination Two drop tests on a matched pair of cadaveric upper extremities were performed to investigate the effect of pronation vs. supination on the peak force to failure for human forearms. The position of the forearm in the first drop test is pronated with the distal third of the ulna oriented towards the drop impactor. This position simulates a 'natural driving posture' from the fixture upper extremity/air bag tests. In the second drop test, the forearm is placed in a completely supinated position with the anterior surface of the wrist facing the drop impactor. The wrist and the elbow were placed on support bases equidistant from the drop impactor. The drop velocity of the 9 kg impactor was approximately 4.6 m/s. Time of fracture of the radius and ulna were identified from strain gauge data, and the maximum strain rates were approximately 4 per second. These strain rates are commensurate with those seen in air bag static deployment forearm fractures. The peak force to failure in both drop tests is shown in Figure 9. These loads are compensated for the mass of the impactor. The peak loads for the supinated forearm are approximately 30% greater than the peak load for the pronated forearm. Associated peak failure moments in the forearm are 115 N-m for the supinated forearm and 80 N- m in the pronated forearm. Since the fixture tests were run with the forearms fully pronated, and the attached upper extremity tests were run with the forearms slightly supinated, we would expect a lower peak failure moment for the fixture test than the attached upper extremity test. This occurs because of the effect of relative placement of bones in the forearm. In a fully supinated position, the bones aligned in a parallel plane allowing both bones to simultaneously bear load. In the fully pronated position, ulna load bearing is not shared with the radius until the ulna contacts the radius. This tends to lower peak force to failure of the pronated position as compared with supinated position. So, the risk of fracture for upper extremities mounted to the test fixture fully pronated is increased relative to the supinated attached upper extremity tests. Figure 9: Drop Test Force to Failure - The Effect of Pronation vs. Supination (All Signals Filtered to SAE CFC-1000) 3653</page><page sequence="11">Effect Of Humerus Position For the attached upper extremity subject tests, 0.1-0.4, the elbow is pushed off the steering wheel during the initial phases of air bag deployment. In contrast, the fixture tests in 1.1-5.4 see minimal initial motion of the elbow until significant flexion of the elbow has occurred. An ATB lumped mass simulation of the effect of a change in humerus angles on forearm bending moment is shown in Figure 10. As the position of the humerus relative to the plane of the steering wheel is varied from normal to parallel to the steering wheel, the peak forearm moment drops approximately 10%. So, the humerus position in the attached upper extremity subject tests acts to decrease the forearm moments relative to the fixture tests. Figure 10: ATB Simulation - Variation of Forearm Bending Moment with Humerus Position Placement Of Forearm On Air Bag Module The placement of the forearm on the air bag module also affects the risk of injury. For all systems studied except for System H, the maximum acceleration is seen within 6 ms of air bag initiation. So, for these systems, maximum forcing on the forearm in the initial deployment is near the air bag tear seam. In the fixture tests, the air bag tear seam was placed at the distal third of the forearm. However, in the attached upper extremity tests, the air bag tear seam was oriented proximal to the distal third of the forearm. The human forearm is most vulnerable to fracture in the distal third. A plot of a typical variation of polar moment of inertia of the radius and ulna along the forearm is shown in Figure 11. Both the radius and the ulna have local maxima in polar moment of inertia near the wrist and elbow, but local minima near the distal third. So, for primary contact injuries, placement of the tear seam near the forearm distal third tends to increase the risk of fracture in the human forearm. Figure 11: Typical Polar Moment of Inertia for Radius and Ulna HUMERUS FRACTURES Humerus fractures occured in both the fixture tests and the attached upper extremity tests. In the fixture tests, humerus fractures occurred under the relatively aggressive System K air bag deployment. Identified using humerus load cell data, humerus fracture in test 1.1 occurred approximately 60 ms from air bag deployment, when the upper extremity contacted the backstop. In addition, high humerus moments seen were possibly caused by universal joint bottoming. In the fixture test 4.1, however, humerus fracture occurred at approximately 10 ms under combined axial, torsion, and bending load. This fracture is clearly seen in the precipitous drop in resultant humerus axial load and bending moment in Figure 12 for System K in 4. 1. For this System K test, we see peak moments of approximately 65 N-m and peak forces of nearly 2500 N. In contrast, these peak levels are not seen in typical System H fixture tests, even though System H is a relatively aggressive air bag. The humerus axial load and humerus bending moment in a typical upper extremity under System H deployment shown in Figure 12 has much lower peak axial load and peak resultant bending moment. When compared on high speed video, the System K air bag inflates and expands more rapidly than the System H air bag. The large flap of the System H air bag prevents full air bag contact with the forearm until 4-5 ms after that seen in the System K deployment. On the other hand, moment values for humerus failure, even for the System K peak moments, are below failure loads found in the literature. Kirkish [24] recommends 130 N-m in both Anterior/Posterior and Medial/Lateral bending. This value, however, is for forcing under three-point bending alone. It is likely that the combined loading of axial load, bending, and torsion contributed to humerus failure. 3654</page><page sequence="12">One humerus injury occurred in the uninstrumented attached upper extremity tests. A humerus spiral fracture was produced in 0.2 under System H air bag deployment. This was identified as a torsional injury caused by a flinging motion of the upper extremity. Figure 12: Humerus Loads and Moments - System K and Typical System H Tests (Signals Filtered to SAE CFC-600) SAE 5* PERCENTILE FEMALE INSTRUMENTED ARM Several instrumented dummy upper extremities exist that are appropriate for use in upper extremity/air bag interaction studies; these include the 50% Male Hybrid III Instrumented upper extremity and the SAE 5th Percentile Female Instrumented Arm. As the current study focuses on female subjects, we use the SAE 5th Percentile Female Instrumented Arm (subsequently denoted SAE arm) to provide a dummy surrogate for comparison with the female cadaveric injury studies reported above. The goal of the dummy tests is to provide a correlation between cadaveric injury and dummy response for the test conditions and air bags examined in the cadaveric tests. A diagram of the dummy SAE arm is shown in Figure 13. Pronation/supination of the forearm is provided by a single degree-of-freedom axial 360° rotation in the wrist. The forearm is a single shaft incorporating a six degree-of- freedom load cell located approximately mid-shaft. The elbow is a single degree-of-freedom clevis joint allowing elbow flexion/extension with a soft joint stop in each direction. This elbow motion may be measured using a potentiometer incorporated into the elbow. In addition, strain gauges to measure two degree-of-freedom bending are located in the distal humerus. The humerus is a single shaft with a six degree-of-freedom load cell approximately midshaft. At the proximal end of the humerus, two degree-of-freedom rotations are allowed by a 360° axial rotation at the top of the humerus shaft and a clevis joint at the shoulder. In addition to the existing instrumentation on the SAE arm, the current study added a distal triaxial accelerometer and a single axis MHD angular rate sensor mount located one third of the distance from the ulna styloid to the olecranon. Additional accelerometer mounting locations in the elbow were not used. Figure 13: Diagram of the SAE 5th Percentile Female Instrumented Arm (Courtesy Denton , Inc.) 3655</page><page sequence="13">Motions allowed by the dummy upper extremity are approximately anthropomorphic with the exception of pronation/supination and shoulder motions. For pronation/supination, the existence of a single shaft forearm limits both the availability and utility of forearm rotations located outside the wrist. In the shoulder, though the predominant flexion/extension motions and upper humerus rotations are represented in the SAE dummy, the human shoulder has three degrees of freedom in rotation and limited translation that is not seen in the dummy. A comparison of the segment masses of the SAE arm with 5th and 50th percentile female human population and the current study are shown in Table 2. The SAE arm is substantially heavier than the reference 5th percentile female population but is similar to the 50th percentile female population. The total forearm/hand length of the SAE arm of 405 mm is comparable to the 5th percentile female length of 392 mm but over 20 mm less than the forearm/hand length of the reference 50th percentile female. So, the SAE dummy forearm is similar to a 5th percentile female population in length, but a 50th percentile female population in mass, the inverse pf the female cadaveric subjects tested in this study. The test matrix for the dummy series is shown in Table 7. System K, System H, System J, and System L air bags were tested twice with the upper extremity mounted on the test fixture used in the cadaveric tests. As the response of System T is similar to that of System L, System T was not used for subsequent testing. In addition to the fixture tests, one System H and one System L air bag were deployed into the SAE arm mounted on a 5th Percentile Hybrid III dummy. For the fixture tests, the center of rotation of the universal joint was located at the center of rotation of the Hybrid III shoulder joint relative to the humerus. All tests used OEM air bags mounted in OEM steering wheels appropriate for the air bag. The test position of the dummy upper extremity on the Hybrid III dummy and on the fixture was similar to the test position for the cadaveric subjects. The forearm distal third (measured from the ulna styloid to the end of the olecrano) was placed on the air bag module perpendicular to the tear seam with the humerus oriented at a right angle to the plane of the steering wheel. The elbow flexion angle was initially set to be 90°. In this configuration, the dummy fingers do not reach the steering wheel for any of the OEM air bags tested. Positioning was maintained using frangible tape. A generic air bag deployment into an upper extremity mounted on either dummy or fixture begins with the emergence of the air bag through the tear seam. As the air bag inflates, there is no significant humerus motion, and the forearm begins to rotate about the elbow until it reaches the joint stop. After the elbow reaches the joint stop, the humerus begins rotating toward the center of the steering wheel. This continues until the upper extremity hits the dummy in the Hybrid III tests or the backstop in the fixture tests. For the Hybrid III tests, there is no substantial shoulder movement until the air bag deploys into the dummy chest. Max. Max.

Within each air bag system, these moments are consistent showing a maximum difference of approximately 10%. Arm position sensitivity and variation in airbag deployment were not investigated individually, though dummy position was repeatable to approximately 2 mm in forearm position and 0.3 degrees in elbow flexion. Peak humerus axial loads are not as consistent as forearm moments since they are associated with the details of the air bag/elbow joint stop interaction at times greater than injury times identified in cadaveric tests. So, these peak humerus axial loads are not generally relevant to primary contact injuries. Forearm moments for each of the systems tested are plotted in Figure 14. As expected, the peak dummy forearm bending response of System K and System H is significantly greater than that seen in System J or System L. Large peak moments after 15 ms are associated with the elbow reaching 3656</page><page sequence="14">joint stops. Interestingly, the peak forearm moments from the System K tests are much earlier than those seen in the System H tests. High speed video analysis indicates that while peak bending moments occur during module cover/forearm interactions for System K, the peak moments for System H occur after the time the forearm interacts with the module cover. This indicates that while the module cover may play a role in injuries, module cover interaction may not be necessary for such primary contact injuries. Measured shear loads in the SAE dummy forearm were relatively low, under 800 N for all tests. This is likely the result of the center of pressure of the air bag deployment being close to the center of the load cell. Average distal forearm accelerations for the four air bag systems tested are presented in Figure 15. Again, the relatively aggressive System K air bag demonstrated over twice the peak forearm acceleration than the other three air bag systems tested. The System H and System J air bags showed comparable peak accelerations; however, the more aggressive System H air bag delivered approximately 10% more peak impulse to the distal forearm than the System J air bag during the first 15 ms of deployment. The less aggressive System L air bag demonstrated peak moments and impulses that were substantially lower than the other air bag systems. Figure 14: Dummy Midshaft Forearm Resultant Bending Moment (All Signals Filtered to SAE CFC-600) Figure 15: Dummy Distal Forearm Resultant Acceleration (All Signals Filtered to SAE CFC-180) SAE elbow flexion is shown in Figure 16 under System H air bag deployment for a typical dummy and cadaver test. The two tests see peak flexion angles of approximately 50° with similar timing. The minimal effect of the soft joint stop is seen in the System H tests. The SAE arm enters the joint stop region of 40° flexion at approximately 18 ms and reaches the limits of travel at approximately 23 ms. In contrast, the effect of the joint stop on the SAE arm is seen clearly in the System K ąir bag deployment as shown in Figure 17. The slope of the flexion is substantially larger than that seen in the System H dummy tests, so the upper extremity attains larger velocities and hence larger forearm bending moments entering the joint stop. On the other hand, all dummy tests see the elbow reach the joint stop later than 20 ms from the air bag deployment. As this time is much later than the time of primary contact injury as determined in the cadaveric tests, the behavior in the joint stop is not relevant for research into primary contact injuries. 3657</page><page sequence="15">Figure 16: System H: Dummy vs. Cadaver Elbow Flexion and Dummy Forearm Moment (Moment Filtered to SA E CFC-600, Flexion Angles Filtered to SAE CFC- 1000) Figure 1 7: System K: Dummy Elbow Flexion and Dummy Forearm Moment (Moment Filtered to SAE CFC-600, Flexion Angles Filtered to SAE CFC- 1000) In Figure 18 , we show the similarity of the responses of System L air bag deployments into the SAE arm with the upper extremity on the dummy compared to the upper extremity mounted to the universal joint fixture. The three tests show resultant forearm peak moments that are within 14%, and the timings of the initial peaks are within 2 ms. Similar repeatability in the resultant forearm moments are seen in the System H tests. These results provide additional evidence that the use of the test fixture is appropriate for investigation of primary contact forearm/air bag interactions. In addition, with the System L air bag, we can separate the effects of forearm/flap and forearm/air bag interaction; 3658</page><page sequence="16">the first peaks in bending moment are the result of flap deployment into the forearm, ending at approximately 7 ms as identified from High Speed Video analysis. The second peaks, however, are solely the result of forearm/air bag interaction. These second peaks rival the first in magnitude for each of the tests and have substantially greater impulse. Figure 18: Forearm Resultant Moment: Arm on Dummy vs. Upper Extremity on Fixture (Signals Filtered to SAE CFC-600) One additional result from the dummy forearm/air bag testing is that the maximum steering column axial load is less valuable than other measures in diagnosing the severity of an air bag deployment into an upper extremity. Tests with System J air bags showed consistently larger steering column axial loads than tests with System H air bags as shown in Figure 19. However, forearm moment response under System H airbag deployment is substantially greater than that seen with the System J airbag. Many factors other than the resultant force on the forearm influence this steering column load including the orientation of the inflator, the volume of the air bag, the air bag module cover material, and the air bag material. So, peak steering column loads may be of limited utility in categorizing the severity of an air bag deployment into an upper extremity. Figure 19: Average Maximum Steering Column Axial Load for All Tests - Bars Denote One Standard Deviation Since the cadaveric and dummy tests were performed in nominally the same condition, we can correlate the injury results from the cadaveric testing with the average peak forearm bending moments resulting from air bag deployment into the dummy SAE arm. For the forearm bending moments, we use all the tests with the System K, System H, System J, and System L air bags as seen in Table 8. For the cadaveric forearms, we limit the injury sample to the 11 female cadaveric subjects tested with the same air bags on the test fixture. For a statistical model with one level of fracture (i.e. fracture/no fracture), the cadaveric response shows complete separation at an average dummy forearm peak moment value of 61 N-m. This does not imply, however, that 61 N-m is a 'threshold tolerance'. If we assume a polytomous statistical process where the level of fracture in the female cadaveric tests is associated with the average bending moment for the repeated tests with a given air bag, we obtain the logistic regression for the probability of either an ulna or an ulna/radius fracture in Figure 20. The result is statistically significant to p=0.02. The regression suggests a 50% risk of at least one fracture in female subjects at 67 N-m (+/- 13 N-m Standard Deviation) forearm moment in the SAE arm under the same test conditions. The risk of both radius and ulna fracture for female subjects using the same model is shown in Figure 21. This curve suggests that there is a 50% risk of both radius and ulna fracture at 91 N-m (+/- 14 N-m Standa rd Deviation) peak forearm bending moment in the SAE forearm. For both logistic risk curves, the one standard deviation confidence intervals are plotted. 3659</page><page sequence="17">Average Peak Ulna/ Forearm Bending Cadaver Radius Air Bag &gt; Moment (N-m) Tests Fractures System K 13ÍL5 2 2/2 System H 1105 3 3/2 System J 61 4 2/1 I System L 42.5 2 0/0 Table 8: Dummy Peak Forearm Bending Moments vs. Cadaveric Injuries These risk fonctions for forearm fracture of females can be analyzed using the available quasistatic ultimate bending moments for isolated bones reported above. Grouping all the available tests, we obtain a weighted average value of 39 N-m for ulna ultimate strength. Carter and Hayes [25] suggest dynamic dependence on strain rate of the form F oc e0 06 , where F is a compressive ultimate load and s is the dynamic strain rate. For our typical dynamic strain rates of 5 per second, the Carter and Hayes strain rate dependence results in a 53% increase in ultimate strength for dynamic bending as compared with UVa quasistatic ultimate strength for the ulna. This is consistent with the suggestion of Melvin and Evans [26] who suggest an increase of 50% for dynamic ultimate strength over quasistatic ultimate strength. Further, Schreiber et al [27] report a 68% increase in the dynamic bending çtrength of the tibia over quasistatic tests at strain rates of 5 per second. So, if we assume a 50% increase in the ultimate strength of the isolated ulna, the dynamic bending strength of the isolated ulna is approximately 59 N-m. If we assume that the radius provides some support under dynamic bending in the region of the distal third of the forearm, the 50% risk of fracture for female subjects at S AE dummy forearm moments of 67 N-m seems quite consistent with the quasistatic data. In addition, we expect the ultimate strength of a pronated forearm to be less than the sum of the ultimate strengths of the radius and ulna. Dynamic drop tests presented above suggest that there may be a 30% decrease in dynamic ultimate strength from impact into a pronated forearm as compared with a supinated forearm. If we assume that the ultimate strength of a supinated forearm is approximately the sum of the ultimate strength of the radius and ulna, we obtain a weighted average ultimate forearm bending moment of 73 N- m under quasistatic conditions. Further, if we compensate this value as above for the increase in dynamic ultimate strength and for the decrease in ultimate strength owing to forearm pronation, we obtain an ultimate dynamic bending strength of approximately 76 N-m for the forearm in a pronated position. This compares well with the 50% risk value of 91 N-m for forearm ulna and radius fractures. Given the nature of the approximations above, there is a rough correspondence between quasistatic bending results and the derived risk fonctions. The moment values obtained using these risk fonctions are strictly valid only using the SAE arm as a test device under the conditions used in this study. However, since the response of the SAE arm has been correlated with cadaveric test results from the desired subject population, we expect the inverse correlation of dummy moment with cadaveric injury to hold. This correlation is expected to remain valid even though the mass of the forearm/hand complex of the dummy is 35% larger than the average mass of the subject forearm/hand complex. In addition, since the forearm and airbag form a coupled system under airbag deployment, the effective acceleration of the of the forearm tends to decrease as the effective mass increases. This tends to mitigate the dynamic effect of mass differences on the effective force (and hence bending moment) on the forearm. Figure 20: Risk of Ulna or Radius/Ulna Fracture Figure 21: Risk of Radius and Ulna Fracture CONCLUSIONS This study investigated primary contact injuries to the human upper extremity under air bag deployment using five OEM air bags representative of a range of air bag aggressivities in the current automobile fleet. This 3660</page><page sequence="18">aggressivity may be quantified using either fracture behavior in small human occupants under 'worst-case' positioning, or the forearm moment response of a dummy surrogate in a similar position. "Using either measure for primary contact injuries, this study found the System K air bag and the System H air bag to be relatively more aggressive, the System J air bag to be moderately aggressive, and the System L and System T air bags to be less aggressive. Primary contact injuries occur early during air bag deployment. This study found that for two air bag systems, System K and System J, fractures occurred during the initial punchout phase of air bag deployment. Fractures occurred during forearm contact with both the module cover flap and the air bag in the vicinity of the tear seam for the position studied. However, this flap interaction does not appear to be necessary for primary contact injury. For System H tests, peak accelerations and fractures in cadaver tests occurred later than in the System K and the System J tests, after the time of significant module cover flap interaction with the forearm. This result is confirmed by peak forearm moments obtained in dummy testing using a System H air bag. So, module cover interaction may not be necessary for injury with current OEM air bags. Humerus position, forearm position relative to the air bag, and forearm pronation/supination have an effect on the risk of primary contact injury to the human forearm under air bag deployment. Fracture strength of the female limbs tested is better indicated by distal third cross sectional polar moment of inertia than cortical bone density. We conclude that, for the conditions tested, forearm bone polar moment of inertia is a significant contributor to the risk of primary contact forearm injury under air bag deployment. In this study, we report the first use of the SAE 5th Percentile Instrumented Arm for the investigation of upper extremity/air bag interaction. Though heavier than the 5th percentile female reference population, the length is comparable to that of a 5th percentile female. The dummy upper extremity shows an acceptable range of motion for the study of primary contact injuries. The SAE arm is extensively instrumented with multi-axis load cells suitable for the detailed study of forcing under air bag deployment. Four air bag systems that were tested using cadaveric upper extremities were also tested using the SAE arm. A comparison of tests with the SAE arm mounted to a Hybrid III dummy and the SAE arm mounted to a universal joint test fixture show that the use of a translationally fixed fixture has minimal effect on forearm response. Dummy forearm moment obtained under air bag deployment into the SAE arm correlates well with injury levels observed in cadaveric testing with the same upper extremity orientation. A logistic injury risk function was developed for females in the 'worst-case' position using the cadaveric injuries and the dummy forearm moments. This risk function predicts a 50% risk of ulna fracture at 67 N-m (+/- 13 N-m standard deviation) forearm moment on the SAE arm. This value is consistent with an extrapolation of quasistatic ultimate bending strength of the ulna to dynamic conditions. In addition, we find a 50% risk of radius and ulna fracture at 91 N-m (+/- 14 N-m standard deviation) that is consistent with the combined bending strength of the radius and ulna in a pronated position.
