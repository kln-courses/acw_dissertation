<plain_text><page sequence="1">INCARNATIONS IN HISTORICAL RELIGIONS. BY JUSTIN A. SMITH, D. D., Editor of The Standard, Chicago. In a review of " Ecce IIomo," at the time that book was first published, in 1868, Mr. Gladstone, speaking of the Christian incarnation, and justifying its consonance with truth and reason, illustrated his point by saying: "The old mythology of Greece, casting off the worship of the elements to the right, and animal worship to the left, had for its central figure, in a carnal way, that very idea which the Gospel was to revive in a spiritual way: namely, what is called anthropomorphism, or the humanizing of its gods, with the counterpart of an equally established deification of its heroes." Recognizing the general truth here stated, and also that one may well hesitate in offering to criticise what Mr. Gladstone may say, it is still fairly a question whether in the sentence quoted lie uses language with sufficient exactness. Is it not too much to say that the anthropomorphism of the Greek mythology, or any other mythology, is " the very idea which the Gospel was to revive in a Christian way." In the sentence immediately following the one quoted, however, the English scholar and statesman suggests what is a principle of true analogy, if not of en- tire resemblance, in the cases supposed. "This close union," he says, "of the two worlds and the two natures had supplied the Greek poets with the chief part of their materials, and had been the inspiring principle of Greek art." Such "close union of the two worlds and the two natures," while availing, as we all know, for the very highest purposes of poetry and art, not only with the Greeks, but with all cultivated nations, belongs also to religion, and indeed has its first and original expression there. It is, in fact, the very nature and intention of religion to bring God near to man, and to aid man in gaining some clear concep- tion of the Being it teaches him to vworship. The veil of the invisible, hanging between the human soul and the divine object of its adoration and service, is no doubt essential, in its own way, to the highest ends of religion; and still, these very ends themselves would be defeated if that veil were such as that all which concerns the spiritual world and God himself were absolutely hidden. The agnos- tic idea in religion makes religion impossible. Without abating essentially, there- fore, that just judgment which we pass upon the crude, often immoral, anthropo- morphisms of paganism, we may with entire propriety recognize a truth in them, and even a reality in them, false and hurtful as they were. One may say that, constituted as man is, they were inevitable. It was always just as certain that man would represent to himself his deity in some visible, perhaps in some human way, as that he would recognize any deity at aH. May it be possible, then, to trace the origin of some of the more notable man- ifestations of this tendency as seen in mythological religions ? Can we say that what appears ultimately as-incarnation, at least in the mythical sense, is, in some of the chief mythologies, at all events, originally personificatio ? Prof. Blackie,</page><page sequence="2">INCARNATIONS IN HISTORICAL RELIGIONS. in a note to his translation of the Iliad, speaking of such personifications as those of Sleep, Death, Dream and Rumor, easily recalled by readers either of the Iliad or the AEneid, says: "These personifications set before our eyes the living pro- cess by means of which all mythologies were produced." His meaning seems to be that the deities in any pantheon, whether Greek, Roman, Phoenician, Egypt- ian, or Aryan, were originally personifications, representative, in many instances, perhaps in all, of those natural forces or phenomena, or the ideas suggested by them, which may have first of all turned the minds of men away from the true idea of God. Thus, if that object of worship which in the ancient Vedic faith went by the name of Dyaus, in Greek religion became Zeus, and in Latin worship Jove, was the bright, overarching sky, in some dim way seen as a symbol of all- embracing sovereignty, of shelter and protection, it is scarcely possible that sky- worship or the abstract idea involved in it, should remain in its original crude state. Rather, the idea represented of protection, supremacy, sovereignty so sug- gested, would in the natural operation of human thought and faith, assume some kind of personal form; hence be personified. But the process could not stop there. Dyaus, or Varuna, became to the Aryan, Zeus to the Greek, and Jove to the Roman, an actual personality, in human form yet with divine attributes. So with other deities, originally personified as representative of ideas suggested by natural phenomena, yet acquiring actual personality in the conception of the wor- shiper, while about this conception grew up myth, worship, ritual, in the end an elaborate cultus. If we may assume the origin of pagan incarnations to be somewhat as now suggested we shall trace in the process these successive steps: (1) That consci- ousness in the human being which we define as the elemental idea of God in man, that which makes him conceive of an invisible life, force, and being as back of all that appears to him in nature, surviving in man even after the true idea of God has been lost, as a testimony to his existence; (2) An association, perhaps not actual identification, of this invisible being and force with phenomena or forces in nature-those best calculated to excite attention, to inspire a sense of protection, a consciousness of supervision and control, or to represent ideas of beauty, of strength, of those various processes in which the machinery of life and nature goes on; (3) In a further step of the same process, the idea thus awakened personifies its object, and gives it a name; (4) This personification, at first vague and evanescent, becomes in the end distinct and fixed. That which was origin- ally a natural phenomenon, or force, becomes a personal deity; this personal deity bears a human form and acts in human ways, at the same time that his attributes are divine. It could hardly be claimed, we think, that this theory as to the genesis of pagan incarnations will apply in all cases, although the language used by Prof. Blackie seems to intimate so much. While it may be true that mythological rel- igion has been in most instances a growth out of nature religion, this can scarcely have been the case with all. The Aztec or Toltec deities, for example, especially the principal deity, Quetzalcoatl, appear to have been deifications of personages famous in the early history of that and cognate races: leaders in their migrations, or founders of their civilization. The Brahmanic idea of deity, besides, the gods of the pantheon being emanations of Brahm, could not well be represented as per- 301</page><page sequence="3">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. sonifications of natural forces or phenomena, or of the ideas suggested by these. For that mythology, however, made so familiar to us all by the large place it fills in classical literature, the theory of origin here suggested seems the most likely one yet proposed. And it gains confirmation from the fact that so many of the figures of this mythology never got beyond the stage of personification. It may fairly be questioned whether the beautiful goddess of the dawn, Aurora, or Eos, could be spoken of as an incarnation, even in conception; or Hyperion, as repre- senting the sun, or in general such elemental deities as Earth, Heaven, or Sky, Wind, Rivers, like Scamander, Achelous, and others. The tendency to personify elemental forces and forms was evidently, especially among the Greeks, a habit of mind. In such cases as those supposed we ought, perhaps, to regard the deific conception as simply one more or less advanced toward that of incarnation, and still, if we are to use language with strict propriety, more or less stopping short. But now, having said tlus much upon the genesis of the pagan incarnations, what shall we say of their religious significance? (1) Their general anthropo- morphic character is to be noticed. This unhappily is not universal. The animal and reptile incarnations in Egyptian religion, and serpent incarnations among other races, are mortifying exceptions. Yet the general prevalence of the anthro- pomorphic idea is a notable fact. In one view, it was a just ground of divine rebuke, where Jehovah said in ancient times: " Thou thoughtest that I was alto- gether such a one as thyself." In another view, it is better that these mythol- ogies should picture the deities as divine men, than as "birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things." Perhaps we may say that the generally prevailing anthropomorphism implies even in pagan man a consciousness, on the one hand, of something in the nature of man allying him to the divine, and upon the other of something in the divine that should make a human manifestation the natural, almost the necessary one:-echoes, these may be, of a Divine Voice once heard saying: " Let us make man in our image." (2) The pagan incarnations may illus- trate for us, to some extent, pagan ideas as to the attributes of deity itself. (a) Thus, there is a monotheistic element in the representation of Zeus, or Jove, as an enthroned king, exercising a sovereignty so absolute that when he chooses to exert it, not all the gods of Olympus, together, nor any power in the universe can resist him. (b) There is, besides, a clear recognition of the divine providence in that active concern in the affairs of this world which the gods con- tinually manifest. There is no appearance of any other interest or occupation of deity save that which affects mankind; while to make needed interposition effect- ual the deity is constantly represented as making himself for any necessary pur- pose truly a man, and descending quite into the human sphere. (c) In general it may be said that while the pagan incarnations are deformed and debased by mix- tures of human elements with the deific, being gods, as Prof. Mahaffy says, made in the image of man, still a study of these incarnations reveals often ideas of what is befitting God far more just than one might, in view of that other large element in the representation, expect. Divine justice, divine wisdom, divine clemency, omniscience, omnipotence--these also appear. (3) In contrast with the Christian incarnation we say of those of paganism that they are of course mythical, never historical. They had their birth back in prehistoric ages, when history did not even exist. They belong to the childhood of the various races amongst whom they were received as matters of faith; and although they lasted on into the ma- 302</page><page sequence="4">DR. TAYLER LEWIS ON BIBLICAL STUDY. turer periods of the life of such races, they had always a harder and a harder struggle against the growth of intelligence, of the historical sense, and of the crit- ical spirit, till at last they sunk into the sort of superstition that is possible only to the ignorant. In every best sense of the word the Christian incarnation is his- torical; that divine story of it which is the basis of all Christian faith was pro- duced and was fully accepted, just at that period in the world's annals when myths, and religions founded on myths, were most discredited, and least likely to find acceptance. (4) Lastly, the pagan incarnations, even while, as we have seen, revealing some just sense of what is worthy of divinity, nevertheless were far more incarnations of what is worst in man, than what is befitting in any idea of God. Such a beneficient exemplar as the Christian incarnation affords was never even dreamed of in them, while their moral tendency and effect are disastrously illustrated in the history and fate of all pagan nations. I . DR. TAYLER LEWIS ON BIBLICAL STUDY. The subjoined letter, which I received from Dr. Lewis not long before his death, in answer to some inquiries I had addressed him about biblical study, will be of interest, I think, to the readers of THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. The world knows how thorough was his scholarship; but in addition to this he was one of the most inspiring and reverent teachers that ever lived. A significant comment on his recommendation of "indefatigable and ceaseless reading" may be furnished by a memorandum I once saw in his Hebrew Bible (I give it as nearly as I can remember, and I think the numbers are right): " Finished 13th reading .......1849;" and the students had the tradition that it had been for many years his custom to read the Bible through, in the original, once a year. JOHN F. GENUNG. UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, Oct. 20, 1875. MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND:-Since receiving your letter I have been a good deal unwell, some of the time unable to attend to college duties, or to do any- thing else. Please accept this as my apology for the delay in answering you. It is not easy to give directions for biblical study. The best and first requi- site is a love of it, which I think you possess. In the next place, there should be indefatigable and ceaseless reading, until there is acquired something that may be called tact, a feeling of the beauty and power of the language, a thinking in it, or something of the familiarity that we have in reading our own tongue. Gram- mars and lexicons alone will never give this, and yet one who possesses it, or begins to possess it, is in a better condition to understand the Scriptures than the most critical scholar without it. I may not have expressed this clearly, but I used to talk about it in my Hebrew class, and, perhaps, you remember what I was fond of saying. As for books, you cannot dispense with Gesenius' large "Thesaurus," in three volumes. It contains much more than the Manual, and I would recommend it to you as a book to be read, and not merely consulted. This may seem strange, the reading of a dictionary in regular course; but I can say that I have not only found profit in it, but entertainment. What we consult for a particular purpose is apt to pass out of the mind as soon as the purpose is answered. The other mode will soon fix the attention, and become interesting. 303</page></plain_text>
