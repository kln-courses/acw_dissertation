<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN: ON THE WEIMAR UTOPIA OF ERNST JUNGER'S "WORKER" Todd Samuel Presner I. Conceived in the early 1930s and published amidst much fanfare in late 1932, Ernst Junger's technological fantasy of a totally mobilized society composed of metallic soldier-workers from a new world order remains one of the most vivid testimonials to the anxious visions and political turbulence of the final years of the Weimar Republic. Bringing together his reactionary political ideas with his personal experiences fighting on the German front during World War I, Der Arbeiter: Herrschaft und Gestalt [The Worker: Dominance and Form] depicts a frenetic society in a state of total and permanent mobilization.' Human beings have been stripped of any individuality and transformed into new, replaceable "types" characterized by an external, instrumentalized "Gestalt." In contrast to bourgeois society and its enlightened subjec tivity which placed a primacy on security, progress, and individuality, Jiinger's vision adamantly rejects this society and all its values in favor of the coordinated constancy of a sociality always at war. JGnger's work ers are neither the autonomous subjects of the Enlightenment, nor are they Marx's revolutionary Proletariat, nor are they the German peas Qui Parle Vol. 13, No. 1 Fall/Winter 2001</page><page sequence="2">104 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER antry hailed by traditional ideologues of a Blut und Boden fascism. Instead, Junger's "worker" is the embodiment of a radically technologi cal distillation of Nietzsche's "will to power," transported to the Ger man front on the darkest day of the First World War - and placed there forever. It is here, in 1932, that Junger envisions a new social order. To be sure, Junger's technological fantasy is impossible to ex plain or justify without appealing to the obvious political and his torical conditions of possibility which fed his desperate and decidedly perverse glorification of war. After all, DerArbeiter was JUnger's first utopian novel, if one can place it in this genre, and like all utopian visions, it was the projection of an ideal made from the standpoint of its author, in this case a highly-decorated war veteran living in Weimar during the crisis years of the early 1930s.2 Junger's fantastic projection was based upon the rejection of bourgeois society - "No, the German was not a good citizen [Burger]" (DA, 17) - in favor of making permanent the front soldier's experiences of total warfare. Not unlike Filippo Marinetti and the Italian Futurists, Junger embraced the violence of technology as both the foundation for and justification of his revolutionary utopia. As early as 1909, Marinetti famously declared that "war... [was] the world's only hy giene."3 After the Great War, Junger not only imagined war in pre cisely these same "hygienic" terms but went even further: he conceived of a world in which the horror of technological warfare was its permanent fixture. Junger's fantasy can be seen as both the product of and answer to a massive social instability and violent political fragmentation whereby the wounds of the First World War are not healed but rather kept open as a way of life. As Walter Benjamin perceptively charac terized an earlier version of the ideas in DerArbeiter: Junger's desire for an "endless war...is nothing other than an uninhibited transla tion of the principles of I'art pour I'art to war itself."4 That is to say, JUinger glorified war not for some other end, such as why and how war is waged, but only for the sake of war itself. Unlike other con temporary cultural commentators and critics, JUinger had no interest in working through or coming to terms with the trauma of war;5 instead, the Great War was an absolute in itself. As its supreme so cial end, the war is indistinguishable from his "worker" utopia.</page><page sequence="3">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN 105 As an introduction to this complicated text, let me give a brief description of the key features of his utopia. First and most impor tantly, Junger's utopia registered the destruction of all traces of indi viduality. "Workers" no longer have names, faces, and identities but rather play fixed parts in an endless, massive, and technocratic society. The workers are formed by military discipline and industrial tasks, wherein order, obedience, standardization, and function char acterize all social relationships. The form of the worker is a part of the whole sociality, and altogether, the utopian whole is something greater than the sum of its parts. This "Gestalt" extends not only to the characterization of the "otherness" of the sociality, but it also describes the precise forms and organization of the instrumentalized technology itself. Traditional social organizations, economic classes, political hierarchies, and familial structures provide none of the basis for his sociality. Instead, its terms and relationships stem exclusively from the militaristic embrace of technology during total warfare. Moreover, iunger imagines his utopia extending everywhere, in all directions, into a technological megalopolis. Towns, cities, and coun tries no longer contribute to identity formation; instead, the totality of the military state extends infinitely. Although Junger never eluci dates what these workers actually do, function and task have re placed individuality and identity. Finally, the machine-aesthetic, applied as an instrument of perpetual warfare, is this society's defin ing cultural attribute. Human beings and the traditional social order have metamorphosed into a coordinated mass of machine-like work ers, with a soldier's efficiency and technology's impersonality. Even though JUnger never espoused Nazism nor joined the Nazi Party, fascist interpretations of DerArbeiter have played a large - and largely understandable - role in securing his reputation as such. Most of these assessments have been rendered by cultural critics who, from the perspective of political hindsight and astute rhetorical analysis, can justifiably and convincingly pass such judg ments.6 But in 1932, critics were much less unanimous in interpret ing the politics of Der Arbeiter as fascist. If anything, there was a general confusion about its political affiliation. The novel was em braced by "/leftists on the right" who rejected bourgeois capitalism and the "un-German" democracy of the Weimar Republic, while at</page><page sequence="4">106 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER the same time, it was welcomed as a nationalistic "German bolshe vism" free of the doctrinaire tenets of traditional Marxism.7 The foreword to the first edition, written in July 1932, lays out ample room for such ambiguity and an openness to almost any po litical vision: "The plan of this book is to make visible the form of the worker beyond any theories, beyond any political parties, be yond any biases.... Because it has less to do with new thoughts or a new system and more to do with a new reality, everything rests upon the vividness of the description which presupposes eyes ca pable of a full and impartial vision" (DA, 13). In other words, Junger thinks he is presenting less of an ideological framework (hence its claims to objectivity) and more of a description of a reality which has already arrived. Although the book articulates no explicit politi cal propaganda or rigid ideologies, it is quite hard to read Der Arbeiteras pure description, given the overwrought nationalism and technological totalitarianism on every page. Nevertheless, review ers across the political spectrum appreciated the vision, if not saw something of their own bound up in it. The originality of the book, according to a review by Siegfried Kracauer, had to do precisely with the fact that it "did not proceed from fixed party programs and ideological formulations which are arguably no longer appropriate to this present day reality."8 Junger was not, according to Kracauer and quite in consonance with the foreword, impressing political demands onto reality but something quite different: "From the im age [Bild] of the present situation he derived that of the future" (GP, 118). In this respect, the methodology of Junger's vision is squarely within the genre of utopian fictions because it is a prognostic pro jection of the future derived, as all utopian investigations are, from the deep inadequacy of its unsurpassable present.9 But what makes his vision unique, something which Kracauer rightly points out, is that its derivation of the future is not deter mined by the application of a set of political concepts, party affilia tions, or rehearsed ideologies of the "left" or "right." At first, Kracauer appears to sympathize with Joinger's method of description: "For the entire political life at the moment suffers from the fact that all pos sible political parties and groups operate with concepts that have long been passed over by the reality that they seek to grasp" (GP,</page><page sequence="5">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN 107 118). This is precisely why Junger introduces the visual derivation of his utopia not from preset political concepts but from looking at the reality of Weimar "with eyes capable of a full and impartial vision," and this is also why Kracauer begins by noting that Junger's vision came from an image or picture [Bild] of reality. But as Kracauer makes clear in the course of his review, Junger's image of the future may indeed come less from traditional party politics and more from the domain of the visual, namely cinema, photography, and docu mentary reports from the press; however, these domains are any thing but free of politics (GP, 120). What Kracauer is likely alluding to, but which he does not discuss in the course of his short review, is Junger's avid support for and exploitation of photography for de cidedly political ends, not least of all in his utopian imagination. It is here that "the worker" is visualized in both its political and cor poreal form. Thus to speak about DerArbeiter and critically appreciate the "imagistic vision," as Russell Berman calls it, we need to look where JOnger was looking in the early 1930s, namely to pictures - spe cifically photographs - of his reality. It is no coincidence that dur ing the years in which Junger conceived of the ideas in DerArbeiter he was also writing extensively about photography and contribut ing to the editing and publication of at least five photograph an thologies documenting the visual "reality" of his time. In 1930, Junger contributed six short essays, including a paradigmatic statement on the relationship between war and photography, to a collection called The Face of World War: Front Experiences of German Soldiers. In 1931, he contributed to the editing of two photo collections: The Enemy Speaks Here: War Experiences of Our Opponents and The Dangerous Moment, the latter of which documented technological catastrophes, such as crashing planes and automobiles, particularly at the moment of impact. In 1933, he published a programmatic photo essay entitled The Transformed World: A Picture Guide to Our Time, which some commentators have taken to be the visual companion volume to Der Arbeiter. Also in 1933, a photo anthol ogy of airplanes and the mechanics of flying, Flying is Dangerous, for which Junger wrote the forward, was reissued in a revised and expanded version.10</page><page sequence="6">108 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER The purpose of this essay is to articulate the visual stakes of Junger's utopia, paying special attention to the ways in which pho tography both contributed to and formed the condition of possibil ity for the descriptive vocabulary of the worker's form. It must not be forgotten that the human body was arguably the most violated and photographed form during the First World War and that pub lishing pictures of unidentifiable, destroyed, fragmented, and pros thetic bodies was a constitutive, although not always welcome, part of Weimar society. It is all 'the more striking (yet also all the more understandable), then, that Junger's utopian vision, derived from the political and technological reality of total war, should be about en visioning a corporeal form that looked so unlike the "real" workers and soldiers, with their scarred bodies and prosthetic devices, liv ing in postwar Weimar. In what follows, I will first place Junger's texts within the cultural context of Weimar in order to both distin guish his ideas from and compare them to those of other intellectu als working in the domain of the visual and imagining the form of the Weimar social body. From there, I will examine the emergence of his descriptive vocabulary for the body of the "worker" in his accounts of war and within Weimar discourses on sexuality. I am interested in showing how, in his later Weimar publications (spe cifically, Der Arbeiter and the photo anthologies published in the early 1930s), Junger imagines the corporeal form of the worker by way of a transformation of all distinguishing features of individual ity, particularly the face and sexuality. It is here, I suggest, that the correspondence between the technologies of the body and his po litical dream of a new subjectivity can be most readily seen. II. Over the past decade, a significant and varied body of literature on the crisis of the Weimar body has emerged. The violation of the fe male body has been explored with regard to the work of artists rang ing from George Grosz and Otto Dix to authors and filmmakers like Alfred D6blin and Fritz Lang.11 The emergence of a mechanized "New Man" alongside and often against a commodified "New Woman" has been treated in the work of artists such as Hannah H6ch and</page><page sequence="7">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN 109 John Heartfield, specifically in their appropriations of popular media representations of gender norms and so-called sexual deformities.12 And, of course, the destruction of World War I has come to be con sidered "the traumatic unconscious" of the entire period, whether repressed by the anxious "birth" of the new Republic or actively en countered in fragmented, prosthetic bodies and the rise of new forms of representation which repress or repeat the shock of war neuro ses.13 These studies have taken as their starting point - and rightly so -the complicated correlation between corporeal violation and po litical anxieties. Not only did the emergence of a New Woman, work ing and voting in the public sphere, threaten an already unstable patriarchy, but the inherited practices of reproducing a representa tion of an encompassing German body politic were also under siege. Neither bodies nor body politics looked as they once did; instead, new and highly contested forms of sexual and political composition appeared across the contentious cultural fields of Weimar. Cultural historiographies of this period have been hard-pressed to avoid viewing the bodies and representations as a foreshadowing (if not a catalyzing) of the fascist consolidation of "ideal" male and female forms within the space of a purifying political ideology. One need only think of the work of Siegfried Kracauer who extended a straight line from the triumphal landscapes of the Bergfilm [moun tain film] to Nazi cinema,14 or the classic work of Klaus Theweleit who sees the lineage of homosocial bonding in Freikorpsmen and their expulsions of the "feminine" as the direct precursor to Nazi forms of male bonding.15 Conversely, and with perhaps more subtle discursive explanations, Hal Foster analyzes the leaky, formless con tours of Hans Bellmer's dolls as an early, but unsuccessful, "femi nine" challenge to the inexorable fascism of the armored male body.16 In each case, the corporeal destruction of World War I and its after life in Weimar seems to point toward fascism. Although I find such "foreshadowing" and "backshadowing" of fascism somewhat problematic,17 it would not be entirely reduc tive to say that the aforementioned histories of Weimar bodies func tion in the following way: On the one side, the corporeal violation and fragmentation of experience from the First World War is the necessary starting point for such cultural explanations. And on the</page><page sequence="8">110 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER other side, these same histories posit the super-virile fascist body, characterized by its perfectly intact form, bulging muscles, Classi cal beauty, and armored battle-readiness. By way of the destruction of World War I and the interwar rehabilitation of the body politic, the first leads, in a more or less twisted fashion, to the second. Several problems arise with such an encapsulation, however. First, the fascist dictation of body form is granted too much weight in historicizing Weimar bodies. The critical political backlash against the destruction of corporeal form was well-established throughout the Weimar period, not a sudden eruption that appeared after 1933 to reconsolidate a lost order. Moreover, the tension between potent "male" and fertile "female" political and cultural domains was a staple' of virtually all reflections on the reproduction of the social body in the Weimar Republic; however, the relationship between visual form and political ideology was hardly clear-cut. This is most evident in the embrace of new photographic technologies for visu alizing and representing the body by both the far left and the far right. In this respect, we need to untangle the stakes and compli cated visual affinities between Ernst Junger's reactionary theories for a new "worker" and the political question of the representability of the body across the political spectrum in Weimar. In historicizing the visual forms of the Weimar body politic, easy oppositions be tween "left" and "right" make as little sense as a strict teleology that charts the rise of the fascist male body. As the recent work of Jeffrey Herf and Bernd Widdig attests, this means that traditionally recognized oppositions between a con servative "Blut und Boden" ideology and modern technology do not help us understand how the German right wing managed to reconcile traditional cultural nationalism with modern, technologi cal rationalism.18 Herf argues that the "reactionary modernists" of Weimar, right-wing thinkers who embraced technology, such as JLOnger, rejected Enlightenment rationality in favor of a technologi cal romanticism true to Germany's "inner Kultur." The oppositions were no longer between industry and Heimat or technology and romanticism. Rather, these were reconciled by a national impulse to create technologically productive forms of order which resulted in new, overwhelmingly hardened bodies (the soldier, the engineer)</page><page sequence="9">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN 111 defined against new, overwhelmingly formless bodies (the capital ist, the socialist, the Jew). But as we will see, in the case of Junger, it makes sense only to a certain extent to designate the former as "mas culine" and the latter as "feminine." Gender trouble, too, began to come from both the left and the right. By building on the work of Herf and Widdig, we must give an account of the complicated and shifting relationships between new technologies, visual media, and political representations of the body and body politic. The Bergfilm, for example, with its majestic, na tionalistic landscapes, was not simply a tool of the far right for reha bilitating lost harmonies; it was openly embraced and even financially supported by many on the left. The montage form not only sought to break apart bourgeois ideologies of family, state, and capitalism from the perspective of the left (as in the work of Hannah Hoch, John Heartfield, or Alfred D6blin); it was also a form em braced by the modernist right, particularly by Ernst junger and other reactionary modernists interested in the use of new photographic technologies for right-wing criticisms of body, nation, and capital ism. The assault on "bourgeois art" also came from both the far left and the far right; in this way, Peter Burger's celebration of the leftist avant-garde needs to be qualified by the acknowledgment that it was not the only way in which new visual forms and political ideol ogy reliably corresponded to one another.19 Despite Benjamin's in sistence, then, that certain concepts and visual forms are "completely useless for the purposes of fascism,"20 political ideologies cannot be unequivocally derived from visual form - whether new material technologies, new typologies for representing sexuality, or new modes of presenting the form of the body politic. Perhaps this was for two reasons. First, violated bodies coming out of the war mocked the very possibility of maintaining intact ide als for sexuality; and secondly, the German social body was in ruin with no dependable or recitable form for the newly-imposed Repub lic. In visualizing new forms for both sexuality and the social body (not to mention figuring their correspondence), both the far left and the far right became preoccupied with new forms of hybridity, espe cially in their overlapping critiques of capitalism. This could not have been more the case than with both the politically splintered recep</page><page sequence="10">112 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER tion of Junger's Der Arbeiter and with the visual representations of the "worker" that he proposes. Not only, then, could technology be reconciled with a romantic, nationalist Blut und Boden political ide ology, his utopia, as we will see, was also populated by "workers" who existed in a technological state beyond the dichotomy male/ female. One example of such a sublation of individual identity was already anticipated in 1922 when Thomas Mann represented the Re public in his programmatic speech, "Von deutscher Republik," as the synthesis of the best of the East (communism) and the West (lib eral democracy).21 This correspondence between political hybridity and a reproductive sexuality was a crucial incarnation of the Sonderweg theory because of its intermediary historical justification of both the Weimar Republic and Germany's peculiar path to mo dernity.22 Indeed, it is precisely from the political anxieties over, and utopian hopes for, the reformulated social body that we can under stand the fragmented and often sexually ambiguous representations of the individual body. This anxiety, this hope, formed the essential problem for J)nger in visualizing the corporeal form of his "worker." III. In the first literary expression that Junger gave to the ideas that he would later develop in DerArbeiter, he imagined the Great War less as a destructive historical event and more as a creative, even regen erative, force. But far from a theory of corporeal hybridity, his 1922 book, The Battle as Inner Experience, detailed a creation myth for both a new man and a new race of "super men." It was none other than Nietzsche's "Obermensch" brought to the frontlines.23 In a para digmatic statement of the war's sexuality, Junger writes: "The war, father of all things, is also our father. He hammered us, chiseled us, and hardened us into what we are.... The war is not only our father but also our son. We gave birth to him and he to us" (DK, 2).24 JLUnger's martial parthenogenesis is striking not only as an exclu sively masculine domain but also as a total obviation of reproduc tion itself. If the war is our predecessor and also our offspring, then the war not only gave birth to the men in the trenches, but the men themselves also gave birth to it, closing the circle. In effect, Junger</page><page sequence="11">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN 113 is imagining a technology of corporeal and social production which would exist beyond and against the conventional modes of sexual reproduction. But more than this, he is also foreclosing the possibil ity of escaping this desirably vicious circle: he wants the war to be total, permanent, and constant, like a perpetual motion machine with no temporal extension. This account of new creation - from hammers and chisels, iron and steel - was waged precisely at the place Junger witnessed it, namely on the French-German frontlines where he spent almost the entire war. Not only does Junger consider the war to be the showcase of virility, charged to the limit with an "overflowing man liness" [dberstromende Mannlichkeit] (DK, 11), he also employs a more subtle and far-reaching gender logic to account for this new creation. "War," the masculine noun "der Krieg" in German, is cen tral to the semantic slippage JOnger draws our attention to between "der Vater," "der Sohn," and the personal pronoun "er," which am biguously refers back to all three. Here, the war stands for sexual potency by way of its masculine gender as well as a uniquely par thenogenetic birth practice where both the feminine gender and actual women are rendered superfluous. In this early work, JOnger makes no room for hybridity or the sublation of sexuality. The logic of Junger's gendering becomes particularly trouble some when looking at the significant changes that needed to be made in the French edition of his Der Krieg als inneres Erlebnis in order to accommodate his linguistic strategy of equating reproduc tion, the war, and men. In Jean Dahel's 1934 translation, La guerre, notre mere [The War, Our Mother], one immediately recognizes the emphatic reliance JOnger placed on der Krieg as a masculine Ger man noun.25 Because la guerre is a feminine noun, the equation between war and father is, of course, impossible in French, some thing JOnger would likely have known.26 The masculine partheno genesis of the war, the father, and the son had to be changed in French in order to preserve the interchangeability that lOnger de sires between all three: "But the war is not only our mother, she is also our child. If she created us, we gave birth to her" (L G, 28).27 In French, the war is our "mother" and "child," whereas in German it is our "father" and "son." In other words, a translation of his argu</page><page sequence="12">114 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER ment out of German is always already forced to undergo a sex change, and this is precisely what highlights the masculinity of its uniquely German nationalism. Junger, indeed, wants no part in a French-German marriage, desiring instead only the one-sided, reproductive interplay between the German war, the German father, and the German son. Yet the war was, at least in Junger's own "inner experience" of its horror, the product of a forcefield of conflict between Germany and France - not a one-sided reproductive strategy of men, but rather a conflict between der Krieg and la guerre. As J)nger will later recognize in Der Arbeiter, the gendered logic of his account of the origins and perpetuation of war cannot be boiled down to a simple matter of nationalizing pregiven linguistic conventions. Not only, then, does the 1922 articulation of battle suffer from a dubious gendering of war glory, one which directly feeds into and on the binary ways in which the social body of the Weimar Republic was more widely imagined in the early 1920s,28 but this very same logic also begs an account of the feminine. This is most obviously the case with regard to the actual reality of sexual reproduction and, to use Junger's own logic, the description of the doubled gender of war. After all, war, like sexual reproduction, involves at least two sides. It is significant, then, that the implication that the war is a proving ground for a self sustaining "manliness" by way of a gender battle between German men (der Krieg) without French women (la guerre) will later be re jected by Jnger himself in favor of an account of total war that sub verts, even erases, traditional gender dichotomies. The solution, which JUnger will realize in DerArbeiter and the photo anthologies, is not male parthenogenesis but rather the technological erasure of gender as an outmoded, bourgeois identity category with no real place in his vision of the worker's utopia. I will return to this point below. For now, it is important, as Junger knew, to specify both the connection between, and the anxiety over, the sexual potency of individual bodies and the reproduction of the body politic. After World War I, this anxiety played out most often with respect to rein vigorating male sexuality and prescribing specific domains and limits on female sexuality, Of course, both the traditional roles and place of men and women in German society changed drastically during</page><page sequence="13">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN 115 the four years of wartime mobilization: Women entered the work place in unprecedented numbers after 1914 and men were killed on the front in equally staggering numbers. The consequences played out most strikingly after the war when, by most estimates, there were over two million "surplus women" in Weimar, most of whom were young widows in their twenties and thirties.29 Because of the rapid rise in prostitution, sexually transmitted diseases, abortions, and pornography, these women were often scapegoated for Weimar's early political crises. At the same time, cultural representations of sexuality during the early years of the Weimar Republic not only consistently stigmatized women as sexually-starved or as prostitutes, but men - particularly, those returning from the front - were stig matized as sexually impotent or downright emasculated. As I al ready mentioned, the stakes of a healthy, reproductive sexuality played out less with respect to individual bodies and more with respect to the constitution of the body politic. If men and women could no longer produce offspring, not only would the family struc ture disintegrate but so would the fledgling state structure. In this respect, Junger's The Battle as Inner Experience is a pointed response to the sexual-political crisis of the Weimar Republic itself. This crisis was emblematically thematized by Ernst Toller in his damning play, Hinkemann, written in 1921-22, and performed throughout Germany and across Europe in the following years. The main character, Hinkemann, returns home from the war to his de voted wife as a cripple, "as something monstrous," nothing but a "living corpse."30 During the war, we find out, Hinkemann suffered an injury that left him without male genitalia, and he is now desig nated a "eunuch." Although he tries to claim his injury as his own ("Here stands a real-live eunuch!" [H, 197]) and wonders how those who publicly ridicule him will be man enough to build a new soci ety, his mortification eventually drives his wife to commit suicide at the end of the play. Before the final desperate scenes, Hinkemann searchingly poses the question which is at the crux of our analysis here: "When someone.. .who was in the war.. .for example... had one's sex.. .one's sex shot off.. .what.. .what would happen to him in the new society?"(H, 1 92).31 In German, the term "Geschlecht" [sex] refers not only to biological sex but also to what we would term</page><page sequence="14">116 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER gender, the socially and culturally determined performance of sex roles. Hinkemann wonders whether someone without a "Geschlecht" can participate in, that is to say, reproduce, a society [Gesellschaft]. The answer he fears, and here the morbidity of the play literally comes home, is "no" because the health of the body politic is con tingent upon sexually fertile men and women in stable, morally grounded familial structures. Toller's play thus gives a caustic cul tural representation of the very real anxieties over male and female sexuality, gender roles, and the family during the Weimar years. Immediately after the war, the relatively conservative Bund deutscher Frauenvereine [League of German Women's Organiza tions] increasingly clamored for both women and men to return, as much as possible, to family life, in order to rebuild "the path of culture" and "form-giving power of civilization" by way of "the home and its order and cleanliness."32 But Marianne Weber, one of the leaders of the League, also recognized the difficulty of doing this, precisely because "cultural habits have been cast off, sexual needs have perhaps had to be satisfied in completely heartless, even bes tial ways."33 The hopes of rebuilding the culture and civilization of the German body politic seemed to rest upon a nearly impossible demand for the renewal of morality and fertility in men and women. Regardless of the political affiliation, then, the stakes of the body politic always came down to the corporeal trauma of WWI and its afterlife - in terms of sexuality and reproduction - for Weimar Germany. This is because, as Walter Benjamin perceptively noted, "never has experience been contradicted more thoroughly than stra tegic experience by tactical warfare, economic experience by infla tion, bodily experience by mechanical warfare, moral experience by those in power... nothing remained unchanged but the clouds, and beneath these clouds, in a field of force of destructive torrents and explosions, was the tiny, fragile human body."34 The broken, partial, and even annihilated body was the impossible condition of possibility for redeeming the body politic. In this respect, then, the calls to order and desires for a return to a prewar morality and familial integrity are somewhat naive, al though understandable, reactions to the remains of the fragile hu man body and the destruction of its social structures. It is thus no</page><page sequence="15">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN 117 coincidence that many of the most respected cultural commenta tors on the immediate postwar period, in both Germany and France, began their observations by invoking the fraught concept of "re mains" to speak about what the war left behind. After World War I, the "European Hamlet," as Paul Valery imagines him in his letters of 1919, "The Crisis of Spirit," is standing in the marshes of the Somme, the mounds of Alsace, the plateaus of Champagne, "[staring] at mil lions of ghosts."35 "Hamlet hardly knows what to do with all these skulls," he writes, other than recognize the mortality of European civilizations.36 The Thomas Mann of the Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen (1918) also starts his most politically conservative estimation of German culture with what remains: "I am speaking more accurately about a residuum, a residue and fall-out, or also a trace, and indeed, to confess the truth, a suffering trace - the re mains [Bleibsel] of these years in order to sort through the fraught concept of remains [den stolzen Begriff des Bleibens]... "37 And, more literally, Ernst Junger begins his 1933 historical photo anthology, The Transformed World, in "1918..." with a picture of the remains of two decaying soldiers, still wearing their steel helmets, melting into the namelessness of the muddy ground. Below it, he places a photograph of two French politicians leaning out of the window of the Berlin-Warsaw Express Train and labels the future-directed pic ture "1932..." [Figure 1]. Although all three begin their politically charged (and politi cally distant) assessment of postwar Europe from the place of its cultural and corporeal remains, only Junger articulates a unique political role for these remains in helping to bring about the form of a new society. J)nger's representation of the war and its corporeal aftermath, unlike that of virtually all other cultural commentators, is not to mourn losses, nor to rebuild society from its tattered remains, nor to critique the sexual reproductivity of the body or the constitu tion of the body politic from the standpoint of its injured and anx iously reassembled parts. Instead, not only does JLinger see the war as a welcome catastrophe for social transformation, his utopian vi sion of a new society of workers is a society always already at war, in a state of permanent and total mobilization. In effect, he refuses to "come to terms with" the remains and aftermath of war because</page><page sequence="16">118 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER ~* ib Fne* (. r; Fiur 1.

There is no "return to order" because the war is itself the new order. The uniqueness of Junger's position, as Benjamin observed, is thus that the war is endless: "They have not yet stopped fighting."38 J unger writes that "World War was not only carried out be tween two groups of nations, but also between two epochs, and in this sense, there are both victors and vanquished on both sides" (DA, 61). Germany may have lost the Great War, but it would not lose the war between historical epochs, a war that is still being waged. The latter epitomized a radical break between experience and ex pectation because the war could in no way be derived from every thing that the previous stock of experience had to offer or confirm. "The unknown, the extraordinary, the dangerous not only turns into the everyday - it also becomes that which remains [das Bleibende]. After the cease-fire, which only seemingly ended the conflict and in truth actually fenced in and undermined all the European borders with whole systems of new conflicts, there remained a condition behind. From it, the catastrophe appears to be the a priori of a trans formation in thinking" (DA, 61). For Junger, the remains of the bour geois epoch of humanism - its principles of Enlightenment and individuality, progress and civil society, individual rights and com munal responsibility - are rotting in the ground somewhere be tween France and Germany. He wants no part in mourning or resurrecting them, just like he wants no part in mourning lost sol diers or resurrecting old social structures. Instead, he looks to a dif ferent set of remains, and in this respect differs markedly from Mann, Valdry, and any number of anti-war leftists in Weimar.39 Junger's re mains are the unanticipated and unpredictable achievements of to tal war, particularly war's capacity to realize the unknown, the extraordinary, the dangerous, and the unimaginable. The remains that Junger privileges are thus not the remains of bodies but rather the exhilarating remains of a barely describable technological achievement, one which necessitated a radical change in thinking and a rupture in the course of bourgeois history. To use a word that Joinger will rarely make recourse to, world war is sublime."0 However, unlike the Kantian sublime, which ultimately cel ebrates the strength of the enlightened intellect, subjectivity, and</page><page sequence="18">120 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER rationality for the constitution of civil society, Junger breaks deci sively from the Enlightenment and this sociality. As Kant writes in the third critique, "we cannot pass judgment at all on the sublime in nature if we are afraid,"41 but must find an ideal perspective or "safe" spot from which to rationally take in and dominate nature. "Safety" is crucial in encountering the Kantian sublime. Any spectator on the edge of nature "is seized by amazement bordering on terror, by horror and a sacred thrill... [but] since he knows he is safe, this is not actual fear...we may feel that very power's might and connect the mental agitation with the mind's state of rest. In this way we feel our superiority to nature."42 The enlightened subject's relationship to the sublime is thus not based on danger, destruction, or the inad equacy of the intellect to "take in" something sublime but rather on the security, fortitude, and superiority of rationality over nature. It is precisely this subject, with his superior intellect and powers of ra tionality, with his enlightened optimism, and individualized, bour geois security that Junger wants to destroy. The technocratic world of the "worker" is JOnger's answer to the Enlightenment and his re jection of the Kantian sublime. Junger's new worker is not a subject reduced to the capacity to employ reason or judgment; these are outmoded values specific to the heritage of the bourgeois world of individuality. Instead, he sees and embraces a "deep fissure, threatening life in our time, between not only two generations, not only two centuries, but as heralding the end of a thousand-year coherence" (DA, 209). All the character istics of the bourgeois world - individual subjects who freely make decisions about the course of their lives, individualized death, the march of reason and the faith in progress, and especially the primacy placed upon security and well-being - are untenable in Junger's new world. The striving for safety, "the need for security and, with it, the attempt to deny the dangerous" (DA, 23) is perhaps the charac teristic that Joinger despises rnost in the world of the bourgeoisie. This world, which goes hand-in-hand with Enlightenment optimism and the strong subjectivity that Kant describes in the encounter with the sublime, thus diverges sharply from the one Jionger desires. In argu ably the most powerful image in Jt0nger's utopia, one which embod ies precisely this rejection of the Kantian world of individuality and</page><page sequence="19">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN 121 security, the worker lives in a state of constant danger but without a face. This is whom he terms "the last man." I want to return now to the question of photography and look at the ways Junger gives visual form to this faceless worker. It is here that we will also see how Junger attempts to resolve the problem of binary gender. Iv. In contrast, then, to the rational security of the bourgeois world and the primacy placed on the subject's safety, Junger's worker utopia is inspired by the enthusiastic embrace of danger becoming a part of "daily life."43 The photograph anthologies of the early 1930s and the text of DerArbeiter can certainly be seen as an attempt byJunger to give a visual form and material justification to danger. The lead essay of his 1931 photo collection, The Dangerous Moment, for example, argued that the Great War was a "revolutionary protest against the values of the bourgeois world" and that the technologi cal achievements of war would continue to enter into and redefine all aspects of the everyday. Junger's evidence for this Nietzschean "revaluation of all values," as he calls it, came largely from photog raphy, particularly documentary and press photos shot either at the last possible moment before a crash or in the aftermath of a recent disaster." Pictures of crashing automobiles, sinking ships, airplane wreckage, boat disasters, and other technological mishaps, far from questioning the "dominance" of technology, actually gave visual form to the new, utopian reality and its glorification of technology. In preserving the instant of impact - what Karl Heinz B6hrer terms the philosophical dimension of "suddenness" - photography be came a new technology of seeing and thereby played an important role in imagining the corporeal form of the worker.45 For Ju*nger, capturing the moment of impact and the technological realization of mass destruction reveals a new power, justification, and basis for a new society. Photographs no longer document "what happened" or the horrors of war and its ghastly remains, but rather present what is now possible as a celebratory program for future action and social transformation. In one of his most detailed, if not programmatic, chapters on</page><page sequence="20">122 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER the technologically reconfigured body of the worker, "The Dissolu tion of Bourgeois Individuality Through the Worker Type," Junger ar gues that through new modes of dress, training, and work, as well as through the entry of technology into everyday life, the physiognomy of the body is being transformed. Not only had the values of indi vidual security and bourgeois sensibility already been subject to radi cal transformations during the war, Junger attempts to make visible the ways in which the specific corporeality of the body has also been destroyed and newly transformed. Because photography acts as a kind of replaceable prosthetic device for the eye, he sees it is as emblematic of this continual corporeal transformation. In The Trans formed World (1933), his last photograph anthology and the com panion volume to the ideas expressed in DerArbeiter, Junger shows how technological changes have brought about new modes of re production of both the body and the body politic, changes which he predicts will eventually overtake the entire world.46 In both works, 3-rn rt th me likei. .tsvat ha . seoa" !tc r=:; . . Figure 2. Ernst Friedrich, Krieg dem Kriege (originally published 1924).

By 1934, in an essay entitled "On Pain," he argues that the "new type" who is evolving out of this confluence of destruction and technology is in "possession of a...second, colder consciousness.. .with the ability to see oneself as an object."47 Human types are becoming "workers" composed of replaceable, metallic, "artificial limbs" and technological extensions of perceptual capacities, such as the camera's "artificial eye."48 As Junger knew, of course, photography was used both before and throughout the First World War to document atrocities, record victories, and capture virtually all aspects of the so-called "Materialschlacht," or material battle.49 But it was not until 1924 that the first politically-motivated photograph anthology of World War I was published, namely Ernst Friedrich's Krieg dem Kriege. Friedrich's book was one of the first attempts to use the photographic evidence of World War I, namely the horribly disfigured, wounded, killed, burnt, and annihilated soldiers' bodies, to try to stop future wars. The book's dedication, written in four languages, reads: "To those who plan battles, to those who lead battles, to war enthusiasts of all countries - this book is dedicated."50 Friedrich juxtaposed photographs of patriotic soldiers leaving their families to serve in the war with unidentifiable remains of soldiers killed in action, often with a bitterly ironic, pithy commentary on military service, war technology, and battle enthusiasm. The final part of the book con sists of page after page of mutilated survivors: soldiers without intact bodies, with almost inconceivable corporeal disfigurations of the limbs, mid-section, and face [Figure 2]. Significantly, Junger's uto pian worker bodies look nothing like these 'real' Weimar bodies. As has been recently argued, the genre of the discursive photo book - "a sequence of photographs arranged as an argument" - was a relatively late development in Weimar, but one that was em braced across the political spectrum.5' For this reason, one which lunger recognized, photography is far from an objective medium and anything but unpolitical. As Kracauer argued, photography may make claims to a kind of historicism (that is, representing reality "as it really was"), but photographs merely "make visible.. .the spatial configura</page><page sequence="22">124 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER tion of a moment," not the objective knowledge of an "original."52 Not only, then, do photographs always betray their own contingency, their arrangement into a photo-montage or photo-book is also a deeply political gesture. And as Junger argued for the right, photographs from the war can be "endlessly recombined" [auf mannigfaltige Weise zusammensetzen]; the photograph "in no way...possesses an 'objec tive' character."3 In the same way that Kracauer condemns the pseudo historicism of the photograph, Junger maintains that it is "naive" to believe that "things are mirrored [by photographs] 'as they really are'" because "through the mere act of taking a picture, a value already occurs."54 Junger is thus much less interested in seeking objectivity in photography and more concerned with photography as a new tech nology of vision which is both part of documenting the rise of the new worker and part of the worker's very corporeality. It is therefore somewhat disingenuous that Junger can preface DerArbeiter with a claim to "impartial vision" while fully recognizing that photography (as both document and corporeal extension) is anything but objec tive. Technologies of seeing, just like the utopian vision of the worker, are, of course, always already political. Unlike Dix, Friedrich, or any number of anti-war cultural crit ics in Weimar, Junger never used photography to draw attention to the consequences or remains of war through images of the injured or mutilated body.55 In the more than three hundred pages of the photo-book The Face of War, never do we see the disfigured faces of living soldiers or the survivor's scarred or mutilated body; instead, Junger wants to capture the dangerous realms of technology, such as the moment of an explosion, the aftermath of ruin, or the remains of battle and its attendant mass death. This is not to say that Junger forgoes all depiction of mutilated bodies. Quite the opposite: there are, in fact, scores of photographs of mass graves and mass death in both of his war photo books, The Face of War and The Enemy Speaks Here. But Junger never uses photography to represent the mutilated survivors of war. For him, photography is both a political record of the technological destruction of the bourgeois world of safety as well as the means by which the new "type" of worker sees itself "as an object."56 It is never a document of suffering individuals and, for this reason, his photo books are not about veterans or survivors. In</page><page sequence="23">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN 125 this respect, Junger's photo anthologies are unlike any other pro duced during the Weimar period. We can now understand both how and why Junger sought to realize the utopian ideal of the "last man" - a relic of bourgeois society - by way of an erasure of all distinguishing forms of indi viduality, particularly facial features as well as sex and gender at tributes. The mutilated face of the individual was for him a surviving witness to the failure of realizing his new, technocratic society of workers. Junger was thus interested in the ways in which technol ogy, especially photography, new work environments, and protec tive masks, contributed to what he called "the transformed face of the individual" in both DerArbeiter and his last photo anthology.57 As he writes in Der Arbeiter: "Even the face that looks toward an observer from under the steel- or crash-helmet has changed" (DA, 116). And in the photo anthology, The Transformed World, once again, only the very first photograph of two rotting corpses with skulls still in their battle helmets depicts the horror of World War I; he labels this photograph "1918..." as a testament to the destruc tion of a former world, one in which people still had personal faces, distinguishing sexual attributes, and an individual relationship to death. New technologies, new work environments, and most of all, new war experiences brought about masks, protective gear, and anonymous death, all of which destroyed individuality. This was for Junger the prerequisite of his utopia. To see its realization, Junger presents his readers with photo graphic evidence of electricians, welders, combat fliers, and other workers in full body suits [Figures 3-4]. He considers these techno logical developments as symptomatic of a much greater change, namely the end of bourgeois individuality and the real harbingers of his worker utopia. The bodies of these workers are in no way fragmented or injured by technology; instead, they are said to em brace the danger of technology to achieve another level of con sciousness and bring about his militaristic utopia. The photographs depict "workers" who are entirely anonymous and play precisely determined roles in employing new technologies for the creation of new social structures. The photographs do not merely capture a person at work, but rather a sociality composed of workers who are</page><page sequence="24">126 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER -i -'4,&lt;. x.4 q.n. - *. . -F :: .: " * ' - ,'-:.:: " Figure 3.

Junger desires a society in which the welder in a full body suit, the skin diver cutting underwater, the workers sealing boilers or clothed in protective asbestos-suits never lapse back into their individual humanity, and the technology - ranging from the actual work performed to the reconfiguration of the body itself- is the means by which all traces of individuality are covered up, erased, and finally, overcome. Junger's workers inhabit a world in which they never take off their protective clothing and go home; they are always and only at work. What makes these pictures so compelling for him is that they represent a decisive evacuation of individuality: The workers are utterly interchangeable, and their names, faces, and genders cease to matter. As he writes in DerArbeiter, the first stages of the "disso lution of individuality" come with the rejection of bourgeois anti nomies, such as combatant/civilian, nature/technology, and male/ female, by way of an embrace of these new material conditions which render such oppositions untenable. These conditions are most easily seen in the embodiment of technologies for combat and work, particularly modes of dress which emphasize "a certain emptiness and uniformity" (DA, 126). In this respect, Junger sees not only faces but also sex and gender characteristics as rapidly disappearing ves tiges of bourgeois society. In an extraordinary passage in DerArbeiter, one which certainly reflects the visual evidence presented in the photo anthology The Transformed World, Junger writes: What first strikes one as purely physiognomic is the mask like stiffness of the face, which is as much inherited as it is emphasized and enhanced through external means, such as cleanshavenness, hair-style, and headgear. In this mask-like quality, which in men creates a metallic im pression and in women a cosmetic impression, a very decisive process is coming to light. From it, we can al ready conclude that the mask-like quality itself is mak ing it possible to erode away the forms by which gender characteristics [Geschlechtscharackter ] are made physi ognomically visible. (DA, 126)</page><page sequence="27">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN 129 It is here that Junger offers the most radical consequence of his theory of new worker "types" and the clearest articulation of the way in which his utopia will leave behind gender or sexual attributes. The forms by which individuals are distinguishable, that is, classi fied as unique individuals with faces and genders, are being eroded [abschleifen], literally ground or sanded away by technology. Gen der or sexual characteristics are becoming merely a part of a by gone epoch when humans needed individual identities and had particular social roles to fulfill. Junger presents his readers with pho tographs of workers who have already achieved this state of techno logical erasure: the photographs are not simply snapshots of a person at work but rather documents of both a new subjectivity and a new society always at war. Technology is not feared for its violent imple mentation and consequences but unequivocally celebrated in its capacity to bring about and maintain this new world. In effect, then, the technological form of the worker's body - situated beyond the bourgeois dualisms of male/female, soldier/ci vilian, security/danger, enlightened/unenlightened, rational/super stitious - is Junger's answer to the crisis of the body politic of the Weimar Republic. In order to fully reject Kant's civil society and the bourgeois history of individuality, Junger needed to envision a cor poreal form which could conceptually sublate these inherited iden tity categories. Hence, the "typus" of the worker, always already mobilized for war and placed at the brink of danger, was imagined not only as a utopian form for the Weimar body but also as a uto pian vision for Weimar society. Again, like all utopian visions, it was deeply embedded in the profound inadequacy of its historical present but without really being able to move beyond this very same reality. After all, this is the farthest Junger would go in reformulating his insistent "virility" of the war experience and the "manliness" of the technological body. Firially, I want to look at the visual rhetoric behind one of the last images of the technological body that JiOnger produced before the demise of the Weimar Republic. In the photo anthology, Flying is Dangerous (first published in 1928 and revised and republished in 1933), for which he wrote the forward, Junger considers the form of the well-oiled, metallic motor as the "embodiment of a new</page><page sequence="28">130 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER martialism."58 The photograph anthology itself, by far the physically largest photo book that Junger worked on, is filled with hundreds of pictures of airplanes; combat fliers, and shiny motors. Junger inti mates a crucial connection between technology, war, and the body of his new worker when he writes that "the person who flies is per haps the most vivid manifestation of a new manliness. He repre sents a type who was already indicated during the war."59 Here, Junger (re)turns to a masculine gendering of technology and war in order to describe the form of what he hopes to be "a race [Geschlecht] of fliers entirely."60 The interchange between the technology of the motor and the new form of this human being, his hybrid worker-soldier, was also underscored in both DerArbeiter- "the motor... [is] the symbol of our time" (DA, 41) - and in his famous 1930 call for "the precise labor of a turbine fueled by blood."61 For this reason, we should not be surprised by the striking anthropomorphism of the staging of many of the photographs of motors in Flying is Dangerous [Figure 5]. Jnger himself had posed what he termed "the decisive question of nature" regarding the breakdown of the difference between machines and Figure 5. "Light Aircraft Motor" from Luftfahrt ist Not (1933). Copyright Wilhelm Andermann Verlag.</page><page sequence="29">THE END OF SEX AND THE LAST MAN 131 human beings: "Who flies then, the machine or me?"62 The answer, it seems, judging by the photographs of airplane motors with out stretched, cylindrical "arms," bolted "faces" which spurn individu ality, and mechanical "torsos" composed of only the most efficient circuitry for routing blood, appears to be the sublation of this binary man/machine into the form of the flying "worker-motor." If war is hygienic and perpetual warfare is a utopia, Junger's worker certainly follows from and emerges out of the technological realization of Marinetti's call for "gay incendiaries with charred fingers."63 Junger wants the whole human body to be flayed in a technological confla gration which never passes. The workers, then, come forward in war when their individuality is completely burned away, leaving only the coordination of their metallic circuitry behind. This is how JUnger dreamed of the future in the last years of the Weimar Republic. To conclude, Junger's writings and photograph anthologies demand a reconsideration of teleological historiographic arguments about the Weimar period. The traditionally recognized conceptualization and historical periodization of the Weimar Re public as an intermediary stage between World War I and Fascism do not easily apply to Junger's Weimar corpus: The so-called "re turn to order" or pathway from destruction to reconstruction, one which leads in its most radically purified form directly to Fascism, makes little sense in approaching Junger. For him, World War I en gendered a welcome catastrophe and inaugurated a new social or der whose defining feature was the use of new technologies to maintain a perpetual war. Rather than positioning Junger's Weimar writings and photo-books, then, within the ideology of reconstruc tion or as signaling a prelude to a traditional Blut und Boden Fas cism, his hybrid vision of the worker's technified body requires us to rethink this periodization of Weimar cultural history into stages of an inevitable march to the classically fascist male body. Indeed, as I have suggested here, JUinger's utopia is better understood as the dream of a new subjectivity, one which sought to overcome and erase all conventional features of individual corporeality through the use of technology - and without moving in any way beyond the constancy of the war experience. In this, we not only find its histori cal complexity but also its rhetorical originality and callous horror.</page><page sequence="30">132 TODD SAMUEL PRESNER 1 All citations will come from the following edition: Ernst J?nger, Der Arbeiter: Herrschaft und Gestalt, in: S?mtliche Werke, vol. 8 (Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta, 1981).

In his early political works, Thomas Mann formulated the "uniqueness" of Germany as the land-in-the-middle, occupying a special place, both histori cally and geographically, in Europe. After revising his Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen (1 918-19) in support of the Republic by 1922, Mann tried to show how German culture was compatible with Western democracy, positing that it was a special synthesis of "Novalis" plus "Whitman," later formulated as "Goethe" plus "Tolstoy" (that is, German Kultur plus Western democracy and German ro manticism plus Eastern-styled socialism, respectively). The best historiographie work on the "Sonderweg" theory remains David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, The Peculiarities of German History: Bourgeois Society in Nineteenth Century Ger many (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984). 23 Ernst J?nger, Der Kampf als inneres Erlebnis, 3rd ed., (Berlin: 1928 [1922]), 3.

Nicht nur unser Vater ist der Krieg, auch unser Sohn. Wir haben ihn gezeugt und er uns." In En glish, the last sentence can be translated to eliminate all reference to the German gendering: "We gave birth to it, and it to us." Although the pronouns "er" and "ihn" probably refer to the war, the slippage between the father, the son, and the war is explicitly part of J?nger's argument insofar as the masculinity of the war is to be equated with that of both forefathers and progeny. 25 Ernest (sic) J?nger, La Guerre notre m?re, trans. Jean Dahel (Paris: 1934); hereafter LG. 26 The feminization of France and the masculinization of Germany is a persistent intellectual topos of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, one which J?nger could not have ignored, especially after WWI. As Alice Yaeger Kaplan shows in her pathbreaking work on French fascism, "the myth of Germany and France as a male-female couple is probably as old as the difference between Geist and Esprit" or in our case, der Krieg and la guerre. See her Reproductions of Banality: Fascism, Literature, and French Intellectual Life (Minneapolis: University of Min nesota Press, 1986), 16. For contemporary accounts which explore the gendering of France and Germany, see Ernst Curtius' Essai sur la France (1932) and Wilhelm Reich's The Mass Psychology of Fascism (1933). 27 The French reads: "Mais la guerre n'est pas seulement notre m?re, elle est encore notre enfant. Si elle nous a cr?es nous l'avons engendr?e." 28 Although Thomas Mann sought a uniquely German synthesis for his idea of the Republic in his 1922 speech, "Von deutscher Republik," he nevertheless appealed quite strongly to a binary gender logic which expelled the "feminine" in favor of the "masculine" strictures of new creation. The gendering of the Republican body politic as male is discussed in Bernd Wittig, Ibid., 55-72, especially 67. 29 See the excellent discussion by Cornelie Usborne, The Politics of the Body in Weimar Germany: Women's Reproductive Rights and Duties (London: Macmillan, 1992), especially ch. 2, "Sexuality"; here, 81. 30 Ernst Toller, "Hinkemann" (1922), in: Ausgew?hlte Schriften (Berlin: Verlag Volk und Welt, 1961), 167-219; here;, 172. 31 The ellipses are part of the text. 32 Marianne Weber, "The Special Cultural Mission of Women" (1919).

First published in four languages, and later in six languages, Friedrich's anti-war book went through several editions during the years of the Weimar Re public. It contained scores of explicit photographs of war injuries, trauma, and death in order to advocate for pacifism and justify its rigorously sardonic, anti-war stance. I am grateful to Tommy Spree and his biography of Friedrich, Ich kenne keine 'Feinde': Der Pazifist Ernst Friedrich. Ein Lebensbild. (Berlin: Anti-Kriegs Museum: no date). 40 In the secondary literature on J?nger, the concept of the sublime sometimes ap pears to describe J?nger's enthusiasm for the intensity of the war experience. As I suggest below, I certainly do not think J?nger had the Kantian sublime in mind. For more on this, see Marcus Faul Bullock, The Violent Eye: Ernst J?nger's Visions and Revisions on the European Right (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1992), 11 Off and 246ff. Building on J?nger's observations, Bernd H?ppauf has pointed out that World War I experiences betray even the limits of the Kantian sublime: "Experiences of Modern Warfare and the Crisis of Representation," in: New Ger man Critique, no. 59.

See his Die ?sthetik des Schreckens: Die pessimistische Romantik und Emst J?ngers Fr?hwerk, (Carl Hanser, 1978), especially 325-335. My take on J?nger's photo anthologies is somewhat different since I am more interested in the visual forms of the body and body politic that J?nger presents. 46 Ernst J?nger, Die ver?nderte Welt (Berlin: 1933). 47 Ernst J?nger, "?ber den Schmerz" in: S?mtliche Werke: Essays I, Betrachtungen zur Zeit, vol. 7 (Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta, 1980), 143-191.

Jennings does not discuss Friedrich or J?nger in this essay; however, he does provide a valuable discussion of the rise of this new visual-political genre in Weimar.
