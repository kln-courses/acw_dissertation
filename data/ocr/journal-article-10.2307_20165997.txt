<plain_text><page sequence="1">eco-forum THE COMMUNITY CONCEPT A special interest group titled "The Community Concept: Ecologically and Palaeoecologically" met Monday, August 6, 1973 from 9 AM till 12 noon in the JILA Auditorium in the University of Colorado campus at Boulder as one of many functions of the First International Congress of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology. Over a hundred persons from the U. S. and seven foreign countries or territories attended and participated in discussions sparked by Everett Olson, a vertebrate palaeoecologist and chairman of the Dept. of Biology at UCLA; Dick Beerbower, an evolutionary palaeobiologist and chairman of the Dept. of Geology at SUNY Binghamtom; Bob Parker, a neontologist and marine ecologist and director of Coastal Ecosystems Management, Inc., Forst Worth, Texas; and Dick Levins a popu lation and community ecologist from the Univer sity of Chicago. The objectives of the session were to provide a forum in which ecologists and palaeoecologists could exchange thoughts on the community concept and other related problems. In general it appeared that ecologists used the term in as many different ways as palaeoecologists. Olson's early statement emphasized the problem, "Diver sity in usage of the term community is stag gering". 13</page><page sequence="2">General Summary Many valuable statements and insights were volunteered. Most focused around a few major themes. Uppermost was the usage of the term community and similar terms of association and assemblage. The properties of communities recognized by the ecologist seem to be similar to those used by palaeoecologists. By Beerbow er's discussion the quasi-equilibrium or its lack was debated. Communities were viewed in a time continuum with Olson calling attention to this aspect. And finally, comparisons were made between ecology and palaeoecology. Detailed Comments Olson defined community as organisms living together in an area, and he elaborated on three community properties: spatial framework, struc ture, and dynamics. Beerbower thought of a biotic community as an adaptive system that approaches a quasi-equilibrium condition or state. Parker defined community as a group of animals that make the utmost use of the habitat. Levins' view is in marked contrast; an ecological community is a social construct by a community of ecologists in order to cluster a series of ideas, observations and problems. He defines com munity in terms of the problems arising from it. Beerbower tended to agree in saying that com munity is both a descriptive and explanatory concept. Parker also agreed that the ecologist first sees communities from the anthropomorphic view but he strives, through his studies, to under stand the community from the organisms view point. The terms assemblage and association seemed to be used in somewhat parallel ways to community. Parker has defined assemblages on the Texas Gulf Coast which represent natural habitats based on hard-part organisms. He found that the boundaries between assemblages could be defined on soft-bodied organisms as well. Beerbower seemed to prefer the term habitat association for environmental and spatial rela tions of organisms. Perhaps the community concept can be better understood by examining the properties of com munities. Properties mentioned were spatial framework or distribution, structure, dynamics, diversity, density, taxonomy, niche breadth and environmental utilization, interaction and inter dependancy of organisms, and energy sources and energy pathways through a community. Spatial framework according to Olson refers to the geographic, demographic area where organ isms live. Levins saw communities as units of biogeography characterized by regional patterns of coexistence, migration and extinction. The structure of communities includes many concepts. Olson referred to occupancy patterns and roles of organisms within the community, obviously thinking of the niche structure. Levins regarded structure and niche breadth as nearly invariant properties of communities in different habitats. He referred to the tropical rainforest on different continents as having similar structures. By dynamics Olson meant the energy flow through the system and the resulting trophic structure. He felt this to be the final objective of ecology and palaeoecology. Parker pointed out that even though relative abundances of taxa vary through time within a community energy could be utilized in the same fashion of similar taxa replaced each other. Other discussants thought that energy flow would be changed when relative abundances changed, because food supply would automatically change. Levins pointed out other aspects of dynamics. The pathways of the food chain result in interaction of species either in series or with one another. Dynamics of gene frequency was more important in community dynamics than a species list. And community dynamics extends even to the borders with other communities where species may be exchanged if the communities are similar enough. Diversity and density of organisms are con trolled by the stability of the environment accord ing to Parker. He reported that salinity resulted in fluctuations in density but not in diversity in coastal communities. Levins noted that changes in patterns of diversity within a community reflect changes in the level of specialization and a more refined division of the habitat. It was also pointed out that deep sea communities possess as high a diversity as shallow marine communities. Taxonomy of communities was considered as a nearly invariant property by Levins. He pointed out that in similar communities different species were ecologically equivalent and performed similar roles. Beerbower uses co-occurring taxa as definitive of communities. Little emphasis was placed upon interaction as part of the definition of community. However, most persons agreed that the flow of energy through a community, the energy pathways and hence species relations is one of the more important properties of a community. Beerbower introduced a new trend to the dis cussion by looking at biotic community as an adaptive system. The evolving community is a function of the fitness of its component pheno types for its habitat conditions. A biotic commun ity then approaches a quasi-equilibrium state or condition consisting of that set of phenotypes available that optimize the fitness distribution in the habitat. In this way a community consists of a set of phyletic lineages or adaptive trajectories through time. Chronofaunas are a succession of such quasi-equilibrium states involving one or more chosen adaptive trajectories. In this way a community consists of a set of phenotypes avail able at that instant in evolution and that optimize and maximize the fitness distribution. Beerbower suggested that communities in similar habitats but different ages be compared. He would identi fy and compare invariant features of the envi ronment as well as variable features determined by genetic and geographic factors. Finally, he suggested that lineages rather than communities be studied because they can be defined with more precision. Study phylogeny to understand paleoecology. At this point Olson interjected that he studies palaeoecology so he can understand phylogeny. Levins saw the community as a unit of evolu tion in which the number of species at a site is a small subsample of all taxa extant at that time. He believes that communities are inherently 14</page><page sequence="3">unstable because natural selection does not maximize fitness. However, environment and genotypes are covariables with dynamics im posed by opposing selection pressures. He sug gested that we look for visible evidence of the genetic structure of populations, such as pheno typic variants which suggest adaptive processes. Sets of variables are changing and approaching a quasi-equilibrium while other things are held constant. Levins suggests that we look for those factors that are more or less constant Chris Smith, a terrestrial ecologist, com mented that a quasi-equilibrium existed between gene frequency as seen in phenotypes and ener gy flow. Shifts in this equilibrium resulted in changes in population characters. He suggested looking for counteractive adaptive trends or selecting pressures that cause shifts in gene frequency. Communities through time was another major theme in the discussions. Olson began by defin ing chronofauna as a community in time and suggested that we examine communities evolving through millions of years. Levins commented that community evolution and specialization would be recognizable in a more refined division of the habitat revealed by changes in diversity and in niche patterns or displacement of species. Pack ard (Edinburgh) pointed out that behavioral patterns resulted in adaptation and hence evolu tion. Evolutionary trends within communities that result from adaptation to behavior may not be readily recognizable or might be erroneously attributed to habitat changes or niche parti tioning. A final theme repeated throughout the sympo sium was the comparison between ecology and palaeoecology. Olson began by raising the ques tion othow to relate ecology and palaeoecology. He thinks that modern systems are no different from those of the past except in their context and thus, can become the paradigm of the ancient system. And yet he feels that a big hiatus exists between the two fields as well as between zooge ography and palaeozoogeography. He asked, "What do we get by bridging this gap? Later someone commented that modern ecologists don't deal with the total assemblage of collectable organisms, and in this way their communities are as incomplete as ancient community records. Erie Kauffman suggested that ecologists and palaeoecologists study both living and dead material in a given habitat. A comment by Levins served to wrap up the discussion. He urged both ecologists and palaeo ecologists to first look at a community from their naive anthropomorphic viewpoint, and then strive to see it the way it looks to the beast.
