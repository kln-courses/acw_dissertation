Pp. vii + 354. $19.50 (cloth) $5.95 (paper) This volume présents to (or absents from) thè English-speaking reader a central text of contemporary thought, together with a lengthy preface. The parenthetical expression in the previous sentence is not a frivolous Ornament. Derrida is a leading critic of the Western philosophical doctrine of Being understood as prés- ence. The interprétation of the tradition in these terms is derived from Heidegger. (Parenthetically, one may doubt whether Hei- degger is right to Interpret ousia as parousia; in Aristotle, for example, what is 4 'présent" is the predicate, not the substance.) According to Heidegger, Being conceals it seif in the very process by which it présents itself as beings. (Heidegger thus makes ex- plicit an Aristotelian thème, implicit in Aristotle; to do this, how- ever, is not the same as to go beyond Aristotle.) Stated with maximum concision, Heidegger' s teaching is the attempt to "de- construct" the ontic mask beneath which Being makes its appear- ance, not merely on, but as, the stage of the world. Heideggerean deconstruction has as its goal the révélation (=unmasking) of Being. Derrida goes one step farther (or too far). To say that Being is "présent" behind an ontic mask is for Derrida to con- tinue in the reification of Being, and so to participate in the Plato- nism of Western philosophy. Derrida thus radicalizes Heideg- ger' s thought, or exposes its Nietzschean depths. He accepts the Heideggerean account of Western metaphysics in terms of the primacy of the subject-object relation, but then turns this account against itself. According to Heidegger, what the tradition calls variously Piatonic Ideas, Aristotelian forms, essences, catégo- ries, and the like, are perspectival projections of the subject's will to power, i.e., of the will to reify Being in order to manipulate it, in order to make man "master and possessor of nature," in the Cartesian expression. The unmasking of Being is thus a destruc- tion (euphemistically, a deconstruction) of the subject-object structure, and hence, unmistakably, of the western European tra- dition. Derrida, however, deconstructs the actor along with his masks (forms, essences, catégories, etc.). Hence the most notori- ous of Derrida9 s doctrines: the destruction of reification requires the destruction of subjectivity . In place of Being as structure, or a structured process of structuring, Derrida invokes "the trace" or</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 67 "differance" (sie), two names for "the unnamable moment of difference-itself" (p. lxx). In other words, whereas Nietzsche replaces Being by Becoming, this is still too anthropomorphic for Derrida, who replaces Becoming by a process of differentiation which has no cognitively graspable structures of its own. (In so doing, Derrida makes fully explicit a subterranean thème in Nietzsche: the origin as nothingness. I shall return to this point below.) On the basis of this very brief sketch, one may raise two questions. First: what is the point to deconstruetion? Why not leave Being alone, if not its masks? Second: how can one write a book or formulate a doctrine that advocates the de(con)struction of books and doctrines? The answer to the first question is as follows. Deconstruetion is secondarily the process of mastering a written text by freeing the process of differance from the masks assumed in and by the structure of that text (as a project of a subject or author). Primarily, deconstruetion frees us from ail structures. The following remark by the translater is thus applicable to the text of the world: "It is therefore not too extravagant to say that "writing" or "differance" is the struc- ture that would deconstruct structuralism - as indeed it would deconstruct ail texts, being, as we shall see, the always already differentiated structure of deconstruetion" (p. lix). As the translater again puts it, deconstruetion is a way out of the closure of knowledge, or "the lure of the abyss as freedom" (p. lxxvii). It is therefore not too extravagant to say that struc- turalism is Platonism, whereas the fundamental and (so far as I can see) unexamined premiss of Derrida' s attack on the tradition is the thoroughly traditional (at least since the eighteenth cen- tury, and in my opinion since Descartes) modem doctrine of the primacy of freedom over Being (cf., for example, Fichte' s Sec- ond Introduction to the Doctrine of Science). The difficulty in Derrida' s version (closely related to, if not identical with, Nietzsche' s version) of this doctrine serves as a bridge between the first and second question. Being, understood as structure, is a bind upon or restriction of our freedom. I quote from the translater' s preface: Thus a further deconstruetion deconstruets deconstruetion, both as the search for a foundation (the critic behaving as if she means what she says in her text), and as the pleasure of the bottomless.</page><page sequence="3">68 BOOK REVIEWS The tool for this, as indeed for any deconstruction, is our desire, itself a deconstructive and grammatological structure that forever differs from (we only desire what is not ourselves) and defers (desire is ne ver fuLfilled) thè text of ourselves. I Interrupt this quotation to make a parenthetical remark. What Derrida means by "differance" has its dosest classical analogue in the Piatonic doctrine of Eros. The defect of the Heideggerean- Derridan interprétation of Platonism is that it takes its hearing by the doctrine of Ideas and neglects Eros. There is a Heidegge- rean attempt to understand Eros as Sein (by Hartmut Buchner), but this commits the converse error of ignoring the Ideas. Back to thè quote: Deconstruction can therefore ne ver be a positive science. For we are in a bind, in a "double (read abyssal) bind," Derrida' s newest nickname for the schizophrenia of the "sous rature." We must do a thing and its opposite, and indeed we desire to do both, and so on indefinitely. Deconstruction is a perpetually self-deconstruct- ing movement that is inhabited by differance. No text is e ver fully deconstructing or deconstructed. Yet the critic provisionally musters the metaphysical resources of criticism and perforais what déclares itself to be one (unitary) act of deconstruction. As I point out on pages lxxxi-lxxxii, the kinship with Freud' s inter- minable and terminable analysis, involving both subject and ana- lyst, is here not to be ignored (pp. lxxvii-lxxviii). In other words, if freedom and differance are primary, then whatever we do must be undone. A free doing is simultaneously an undoing, hence (as one may suggest) a symbolical manifesta- tion of, and identification with, the abyss that has replaced Pia- tonic Being and the Christian God (Platonism for the masses). This makes radically problematical the interprétation of any text and (as the author's self-consciousness in the parenthetical ex- pression shows) the interpretative act itself. For in a literal sense, the only genuine interprétation is a deconstruction. It follows that the only genuine assertion of a doctrine of interpré- tation, if it is itself a genuine interprétation of differance, and so an act of freedom, must be radically destructible, i.e., subject to as many interprétations as there are readers, or readings. The genuine pronouncement of a doctrine of interprétation is silence, itself the naturai conséquence of mutually cancelling utterances. The destruction of the subject and of self-consciousness leads to</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 69 an émancipation of the text, not as a doctrine, but as thè occa- sion for the destruction of doctrinal impediments to the abyss of freedom. The translater is, as I just not ed, aware of this prob- lem, hence her regulär emphasis upon the dual nature of inter- prétation as préservation and deconstruction. She rightly notes that the problem dérives from Nietzsche. However, if I under- stand her correctly, she seems to believe that Derrida's para- doxical formulations of interprétation as a joint préservation and destruction, a crossing-out instead of an erasing, turn the prob- lem into its own solution. This is the inference I draw from the foUowing passage; the author is speaking of work with concepts inherited from metaphysics: Heidegger came close to undoing them, "destroying" them (Hei- degger1 s word), but gave in to them as well. Freud nearly always believed that he worked within them. But Nietzsche cracked them apart and then advocated forgetting that fact. Perhaps this entire argument hangs on who knew how much of what he was doing. The will to knowledge is not easy to discard. When Der- rida claims for himself that he is within yet without the clôture of metaphysics, is the différence not precisely that he knows it at least? It is diffîcult to imagine a solution to the problem that would go beyond Nietzsche's: to know and then actively to for- ge t, convincingly to offer in his text his own misreading (p. xxxviii). For the author, to repeat, it seems that self-consciousness is a virtue whereas the self is, so to speak, a vice (or vicious). But this will not do. Nietzsche must forget his attack on subjects and objects in order to create supermen and a doctrine of creativity. Derrida seems always to be remembering just as he ought to be forgetting. His very Parisian self-consciousness ("look how clever I am!") drives his destructive activity farther than Nietzsche's, and so it amounts to less than Nietzsche's. Derrida is a man of intelligence, subtlety, and érudition. If I may express a complex opinion in a phrase, what he lacks is phronesis. His readings of spécifie texts are often brilliant (or used to be; the récent productions are no longer intelligible), yet his theoretical account of reading strikes me as profoundly s ili y. Underneath the conceptual pyrotechnies, which may be taken as the ontic masks assumed by the author, there is neither Sein nor Denken, but a human, all too human mixture of the modem nostalgia for freedom and the unmastered wish to épater le</page><page sequence="5">70 BOOK REVIEWS bourgeois - two masks frequently assumed by the will to power. I can make only an oblique comment about the quality of the translation. When I read the original some years ago, I found it often hard going but continuously interesting and often fascinat- ing. The English translation strikes me as pretentious, verbose, and too frequently empty. This may be due to a dulling of my perceptions in the interval between the two readings, or to the untranslatability of Heideggerean and post-Heideggerean writ- ings. I am not challenging the accuracy of the translation; per- haps I am objecting to its accuracy. The translator clearly knows a great deal about Derrìda, but she is (perhaps rìghtly) so self- conscious about producing an introduction for such a doctrine that the results are coy, obscure, and rambling. I must therefore doubt that thè preface will be useful to the novice. A final com- plaint: there are far too many misprints in this édition. Lest Derrida's admirers rìse up in wrath against my Platonistic ο ver- simplification s, let me close on this note: this book deserves to be widelv read and widelv criticized.
