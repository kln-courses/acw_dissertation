<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES BRANCH CABELL: A LATTER-DAY ENLIGHTENER By Dorothy B. Schlegel Many Americans today seem scarcely to have heard of the Virginia writer, James Branch Cabell. The situation was quite different, however, in the 1920's. In that decade his name was on the lips of people as different from each other as Mae West and Carl Van Doren. His popularity, at that time, was caused primarily by the action in 1920 of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, which banned his novel Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice , on the grounds of its alleged indecency. Although his name has since faded from view, this Richmond writer continued to produce tales, novels, and essays to the year 1955; in fact, he was still writing busily until his death in 1958. The major body of Cabell's work was gathered together by the author himself and published in eighteen volumes from 1927 to 1930 under the title The Works of James Branch Cabell. Cabell, however, liked to call his collected works in this edition, " The Biography of the Life of Manuel." After 1930 there were subsequent pieces of work, the most significant of which were classified by Cabell into groups of five separate trilogies. Of these trilogies perhaps the group most worthy of attention from a purely literary standpoint is the trio entitled separately Smirt, Smith, and Smire, which were published collectively in Italy as The Nightmare Has Triplets. In spite of Cabell's enormous literary output, he has largely been ignored by American critics, or, if they have written about him at all, they seem to have been divided completely as to the direction and significance of his work. They have either praised him lavishly or have written the most scathing denunci- ations of both his person and his books. Perhaps one of the causes for the lack of understanding of Cabell's work is that most American critics have been trained primarily in the Anglo- American literary tradition. Since Cabell did not employ the usual American literary techniques and subject matter, and 223</page><page sequence="2">224 Dorothy B. Schlegel since his critics found that his works did not seem to conform to the standards which both American and English critics of the twentieth century have come to deem excellent, they have been at a loss as to what to make of him. Many have simply dismissed him as a maverick. In fact, one critic went so far as to say that Cabell had not written in any of the usual literary traditions. Actually, most of Cabell's more mature work is in a definite literary tradition - that of the eighteenth- century Enlightenment, especially the French, although he was influenced to some extent by English and German Enlighteners, such as Pope and Goethe. Cabell had developed catholic tastes in his undergraduate days at William and Mary. During his long life, he coursed through many literatures and mythologies, but the literature which from his college days had interested him the most and the one which was destined to affect his later writing to the greatest extent was that of France. Americans have been puzzled, for instance, by Cabell's the- ology. To American Fundamentalists, who, in many sections of the country have been in the preponderance in the past, and to good British Anglicans, Cabell's views on religion seem ambiguous, to say the least. The author of the last book written on Cabell, an Englishman named Desmond Tarrant, apparently wanted the subject of his critical biography, James Branch Cabell: The Dream and the Reality , to wear a mantle of Christian respectability. He wrote that Cabell had a positive and indeed a Christian belief.1 He based his remark on Cabell's conclusion in Beyond Lije that God is the spirit of romance in man - that is, the desire to have " the creatures of earth and the affairs of earth, not as they are, but ' as they ought to be.' " 2 Although, on the surface, Cabell's words may be inter- preted as being quite orthodox, yet, actually, throughout most of his writing Cabell came closer to Voltaire's position that, if there were no God, humankind would have had to invent him. Cabell felt, on the whole, that religion is something of a luxury which man gives himself to enable him to endure the harsh realities of life and of death. A detailed study of Cabell and of the eighteenth-century 1 (Norman, Oklahoma, 1967), p. 77. 2 The Works of James Branch CabeU , Storisende ed.

Enlighteners, as a type, are usually impatient with religious conformists because of their intolerance - that trait labeled by Voltaire l'infâme. Another reason for the irritation of liberals is the lack of correspondence between Christian beliefs and Christian ethics. The Inquisition was still raging in eighteenth-century France, where people well into the century were being imprisoned, exiled, and tortured for their failure to conform to the dogma of the Catholic church. While Cabell was not confronted with a situation which was so cruel and inhuman as that in Europe, yet he, too, was constantly being annoyed by the Fundamentalism of the Bible belt in the South, which he felt was scarcely consonant with the questionable ethics of his fellow-Southerners. Occa- sionally, he touched upon the real canker in the hearts of all white Southerners - their treatment of the Negroes. For in- stance, in a chapter in The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck, called " Virginia Quite Understands," Cabell speculated briefly on what the family maid, a mulatto named Virginia, might really be thinking behind her " pleasant yellow face as im- perturbable as an idol's." 8 Although Cabell, like most other white Southerners, rarely touched upon the subject of the exploitation of the Negroes, yet throughout his books there is the implication, which sometimes becomes most explicit, that all is not as well as it should be in this Eldorado, which is Virginia. Because of their disillusionment with mankind, the Enlight- eners, especially in France, used, for the most part, ridicule, rather than downright denunciation, to attack their adversaries. They had learned that raillery is an effective means of correct- ing opinion from one of the most influential of the English Enlighteners, the third Earl of Shaftesbury, whose collected essays, published early in the eighteenth century under the title The Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, etc. were highly esteemed by the French. Although Cabell never mentioned Shaftesbury by name throughout his work, yet he might have imbibed his techniques and ideas indirectly from Shaftesbury's French followers and from Pope, whose * Work», XIV, 58.</page><page sequence="4">226 Dorothy B. Schlegel Essay on Man, based supposedly on Bolingbroke's notes from Shaftesbury's essays, gave Cabell the title, Straws and Prayer- books, for one of the volumes of his " Biography." It is alto- gether possible, too, that Cabell might have had direct contact with Shaftesbury's essays in a course devoted to logic, ethics, and the history of philosophy, which he took his senior year at William and Mary.4 Since Shaftesbury is generally considered one of the most significant of the moral philosophers of the eighteenth century, Cabell might have read all or parts of the Characteristics in his undergraduate days, for, at times, his techniques and, occasionally, his actual words resemble rather closely those of the Englishman. Of course, this similarity may also be due to the fact that people of like mind frequently express themselves in a similar fashion. At any rate, Shaftesbury, the eighteenth-century Enlighten- ers, and Cabell all used similar literary techniques - irony, ex- aggeration, understatement, and the eye of innocence - to com- bat what they deemed to be the four main facets of orthodox religion: first, the belief in an anthropomorphic deity; second, the esteem accorded to the sacred writings which perpetuate this belief; third, the credence in the miracles which strengthen and enforce the belief; and, fourth, the resultant activities - both the rituals and the everyday behavior - by which devotes express their belief. The first target of attack of the great skeptics of history has usually been the nature of the deities whom the masses revere. Cabell, like the eighteenth-century Enlighteners and others of their ilk, was generally of the opinion that the finite brain of man is utterly incapable of comprehending the Infinite. The deists, the most orthodox of the liberals of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, did entertain for a time a watered- down, common-denominator sort of god, whom they thought of first as a clockmaker and then as the Grand Architect of the Universe, but even he became, eventually, in the pages of the later Diderot and the Baron d'Holbach, only dynamic energy which takes on organization. Diderot revealed his impatience with the usual human conception of God when he called out 4 William Leigh Godschalk, " James Branch Cabell at William and Mary: The Education of a Novelist," The William and Mary Review , V, No, 2 (Spring, 1957), Ô,</page><page sequence="5">James Branch Cabell : A Latter-Day Enlightener Ž27 ringingly in his Pensées philosophiques , " Élargissez Dieu. Voyez-le partout où il est, ou dites qu'il n'existe point." 5 Voltaire, again and again, attacked the belief in an anthropo- morphic deity by exaggerating this conception to the point of absurdity. He liked to create in his tales, such as Zadig, an ironical situation in which a heavenly visitant appears to an earthling and, at the very moment of the great revelation, quixotically advises the poor mortal to cease troubling his head about esoteric matters, which he can never comprehend in any event, and to go about his earthly affairs, which are within his grasp. Cabell adopted Voltaire's use of hyperbole in The Nightmare Has Triplets . Exaggerating the Southerners' implicit faith in a very human deity, he brought God, termed by Cabell the " All-Highest," face to face with a smart young whippersnap- per named " Smirt." Smirt and the All-Highest chat cosily with each other, while reposing on billowy clouds. In this conver- sation, Cabell " out-Voltaired " Voltaire in his exaggeration, his understatement, and his irony by reversing the usual relation- ship between God and man. He elevated Smirt to the greatness of God, reduced God to the size of man, and made the King of Heaven deferential to Smirt, the earthling. After all, why should God not be respectful? Had it not been Smirt and his fellow human beings who had brought the creator of all things into being in the first place and had given him human form? In the course of this astral conversation, Cabell managed also to cast aspersion upon the second target of the Enlight- eners - the Holy Scriptures. Both the eighteenth-century Illu- minati and their twentieth-century descendant accomplished their end by attacking, in actuality, the mind of humankind, who, they all felt, of course, was really responsible for God's " masterpiece " - the Bible. The human targets of the repre- sentatives of the two periods differ, however. The eighteenth- century Enlighteners liked to vilify the authors of the so-called " word of God." They played up the ignorance and poverty of the Jews, who were presented by them as an obscure people dwelling at the far eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. By this means, they hoped to reveal the irony of a situation which 5 J. Assézat et Maurice Tounieux, eds., Oeuvres completei de Diderot (Paris, 1876), I, 138.</page><page sequence="6">228 Dorothy B. Schlegel would allow great churches and governments to be founded upon the pronouncements of a people who were scarcely able to govern themselves, let alone half the world. The French seem to have taken their cue from a passage in Shaftesbury's " Soliloquy, or Advice to an Author," in which the Englishman, early in the eighteenth century, set forth a line of thought which subsequent Enlighteners were to adopt. In this work, in 1710, Shaftesbury had written: The simplicity of the people [the Jews] must certainly have been very great, when the best disciples had their heads so running upon their loaves, that they were apt to construe every divine saying in a belly sense, ... No wonder if the better and nobler self was left as a mystery to a people who of all human kind were the most grossly selfish, crooked, and perverse.6 This line of attack was followed by Voltaire in a little poem, written while he was still quite a young man, called " Le Pour et le Contre," in which he spoke of the Jews as " un peuple obscur, imbecile, et volage." 7 Similarly, D'Holbach, in his Christianisme dévoilé , marveled at the fact that an obscure Jew could have managed to persuade people that he was the Messiah and so play upon the ignorance and abjectness of the disciples.8 In his attack upon human intelligence, Cabell did not follow the lead of the English and French by singling out the Jews, specifically. It was not the fashion to do so, at least in print, in twentieth-century America, and Cabell was too much of a cosmopolite to have done so in any case. Indeed, he found another scapegoat upon which to pin dullness and lack of understanding. He found exactly what he needed, not in the authors of Holy Writ, but in the receivers , his own compatriots - his beloved, but unperceptive Southern neighbors - whom he deemed much too immature and perverse to understand any but the most human type of God.

Smirt shudders at such a proposal, for he feels, much as a father would, that he must protect this creation of his " from the cruel and silent derision " which he is certain " would incur quite inevitably by making any more revelations to mankind in the present state of American letters." 9 Such a measure, he feels, would be especially deplorable in the South, for the South because of its persistent anti-intellectualism would remain steadfastly " silent and unscornful, not heeding this book, or any other book." 10 By this adroit combination of the exaggeration of human vanity and of the irony of a situation in which the finite mind of man believes that it can comprehend the Unknowable, both the eighteenth-century Enlighteners and Cabell managed to communicate to their readers their idea that man's concept of God is ever shifting and, hence, completely unreliable. The third target of most Illuminati is human credence in miracles and oracles. Again, they usually resort to ridicule to set forth their conviction that too specific a belief in the Unknowable is impossible for humankind. To drive home their point, they frequently use women and children as prime ex- amples of the credulous, for the more sophisticated members of society usually feel that women, children, and peasants are among the most simple-minded, if not the most foolish, of mankind. Fontenelle, in his Histoire des Oracles , had an episode in which a gold tooth, which had "miraculously" appeared in the mouth of a child, was eventually revealed to be a hoax, for the tooth had been skillfully covered with gold foil. Likewise, in the Silver Stallion, one of the volumes of his " Biography," Cabell used a child as a point of departure to show that a whole religion may come into being as the result of a preposterous story concocted by a small boy, Jurgen, to protect himself from being punished for running away from home. He claimed that he had seen the transfiguration and 9 (New York, 1934), p. 64. 10 Ibid., p. 63.</page><page sequence="8">280 Dorothy B. Schlegel assumption into heaven of Dom Manuel, the hero and pro- genitor of a large and important family. Eventually, his words were generally accepted as gospel truth by the members of his society.11 The Enlighteners, then, as a group, seem to enjoy concocting situations which reveal the fraudulence, ignor- ance, or, at best, the innocence of those who attach too much importance to earthly manifestations of the supernatural. Cabell was especially scornful of the doctrine of the resur- rection of the body so specifically insisted upon by the creed of his own Episcopal church. In his comment upon this subject, he resorted to indecencies reminiscent of those of Voltaire in La Pucelle. He subjected this doctrine, which is intoned un- thinkingly Sunday after Sunday by hundreds of Christians all over the world, to the most scathing and indecorous satire, when he wrote on a situation which might possibly occur at the Last Judgment: I am meditating, this afternoon, upon the sociology of Doomsday. The dead will then arise with their bowels, which will undoubtedly continue to function. In Our Father's house are many outhouses. Yes, there will be comfort stations in Paradise with millions of rest rooms; and it is a solemn thought to reflect upon the holy persons enthroned in them every morning.12 Man is indeed naif, thought Cabell, to insist upon the resurrec- tion of the body in its physical form. The fourth target of attack of these self-appointed critics of society is the outward manifestation of inner beliefs, both in the form of man's rituals, in which he honors his god, and in his everyday behavior, in which he honors or dishonors his fellowmen. In order to show what they deem the meaninglessness of most religious observances, the liberal writers in any society frequently use a device which has long been a favorite with social critics; they subject human activity, especially its cere- monial observances, to the cold, objective eye of an outsider. This so-called " eye of innocence " is effective because it reduces the people observed to the status of addlepates, while the on- looker takes on the lofty superiority of a visitor from Olympus. Shaftesbury, in his " Miscellaneous Reflections," used this 11 Works, III, 8-e. "Srośrt , p. 183.</page><page sequence="9">James Branch Cabell: A Latter-Day Enlightener 231 means to criticize the doctrine of apostolic succession. He imported an Indian to England, had him taken to several churches, and let him observe Anglican services, until the Indian asked " who those persons were whom he observed haranguing so long with such authority from a high place." He was told that " they were ambassadors from the Al- mighty." 13 With his Indian background he assumed, then, that they must be ambassadors from the sun. Later, the con- fusion and the lack of understanding of the young Indian was shown when he hazarded the guess that the preachers in dis- senting churches must be " ambassadors from the moon." 14 Perhaps the best known and the most complete example of the use of this device was provided by the Lettres persanes of Montesquieu, who imported two Persians, à la Shaftesbury, into France and had them reveal through their wonderment and their subsequent comments the weaknesses in French society. Cabell, then, writing in a time-honored tradition, used the " eye of innocence " to reveal his own views on what appeared to him to be the meaninglessness of most religious observances and the puzzling behavior of the clergy. He, too, wrote in the same vein as had Shaftesbury concerning religious observances. I must set about this by putting on my best raiment, - for, like, children, we need must " dress up " for everything we " play at," - and by going into a building of which the roof is indecorously adorned with a tall phallic symbol. . . . There we perform a drill of standing, sitting and kneeling, and we read and sing archaic observations from little books. . . . An honest gentleman, whose conduct upon week-days I cordially revere, emerges from the vestry, . . . and devotes some twenty minutes to revising one or another well-meant utterance of Christ into conformity with more modern ideas. The plates are passed, into which we put money, to pay for the heating, lighting and general upkeep of the building, and the living expenses of the clergyman and the janitor. Now all this is likewise more or less harmless, yet, sanely viewed, it is difficult to connect in any way with religion.15 Much of what Christians do and have done Cabell and his kind have found infinitely difficult to connect in any way 18 Characteristics , II, 366. "Ibid. 15 Beyond Uje. , Works , I, 173-74.</page><page sequence="10">232 Dorothy B. Schlegel with religion. They find men, in general, too simple-minded, weak, and inefficient to put their theories into practice in their daily lives. Just as had his eighteenth-century predecessors, Cabell found the rapacity and cruelty of professed Christians in the New World one of the most difficult manifestations of religion to comprehend. Furthermore, in Cabell's case, his dis- approval of the Spaniards' mistreatment of the Indians might have been a means of attacking obliquely whole groups of people who victimize other, more helpless nations or races in the name of religion. In his book, The First Gentleman of America , Cabell adopted, then, an attitude similar to that set forth by Voltaire in his play Alzire, in which the Frenchman had complained bitterly of the cupidity of los ņadres in Paraguay. By an adroit combination of hyperbole and under- statement, the Virginian made clear his position on the matter of the exploitation of one people by another who profess to be Christians when he wrote: ... all stalwart Spain delighted to hear about the . . . unstinted gold which a fair marksman could get in the west, so very easily, without any awkward twinges of conscience, by shooting down like partridges a few hundred unarmed infidels. So, in most cases, it was gold of which the brave adventurers who went to America dreamed. It was gold for which they sought, and gold which they demanded from the Indians, and gold which they got hourly, by one means or another, now that the heathen west had begun to allure all hardy Christians who hungered for wealth or who loved adventure, or who needed to escape from the unwelcome attentive- ness of the police.16 Although most of the champions of free thought have de- plored the bloody trail which Christianity has streaked through the centuries, yet, many of them were, in their daily lives, only closet heroes. For this reason, they all indulged, at times, in a species of seeming duplicity, by which they were, evidently, attempting to protect themselves from the shafts of their adversaries, or perhaps, in some moods, they really were sincere, for man's mind is ever inconsistent and vacillating. Most of the eighteenth-century Enlighteners performed, at intervals, the rituals of their respective religions. Moreover, they had the habit of imbedding in their work curious confessions of faith, 1# (New York, 1942), p. 16.</page><page sequence="11">James Branch Cabell: A Latter-Day Enlightener 233 which do not always seem to be in harmony with their usual patterns of thought. These confessions are strikingly similar both in content and in tone. They all call attention to their writers' professed orthodoxy, while, at the same time, they suggest the inability of the persons who had composed them to understand the Christian mysteries. Most of these passages manage to convey an impression of irony, however, partly because of the words themselves and partly because of the overall purpose of the works in which they occur. Shaftesbury inserted his " confession " into one of the most liberal of his essays, the " Miscellaneous Reflections," in which he had written: ... we can with confidence declare that we have never in any writing, public or private, . . . acquitted ourselves otherwise than as just conformists to the lawful church; so we may, in a proper sense, be said faithfully and dutifully to embrace these holy mysteries, even in the minutest particulars, and without the least exception on account of their amazing depth.17 Since this is followed by a descant on the accidents which have befallen Holy Writ, it becomes obvious that Shaftesbury did not put much stock in the infallibility of the Sacred Word. Diderot, too, in his Pensées philosophiques , the deists' re- joinder to the tormented Pascal, professed his allegiance to a religion which he found difficult to understand since he had no concrete knowledge upon which to base his beliefs. He wrote: Je suis né dans l'église catholique, apostolique et romaine et je me soumets de toute ma force à ses décisions. Je veux mourir dans la religion de mes pères, et je la crois bonne autant qu'il est possible à quiconque n'a jamais eu aucun commerce immédiat avec la Divinité et qui n'a jamais été témoin d'un miracle. Voilà ma profession de foi; je suis presque sûr qu'ils seraient mécontent bien qu'il n'en ait peut-être pas un entre eux qui soit en état d'en faire une meilleure.18 Diderot, then, in his confession professed an allegiance to the religion into which he had been born and in which he hoped to die, even though he had never had any direct relationship with the Divinity nor had ever witnessed a miracle. He, thereby, 17 Characteristics , II, 852. 18 Oeuvres , I, 153.</page><page sequence="12">234 Dorothy B. Schlegel paid lip service, at least, to beliefs for which he felt there were no adequate proofs. Finally, we have Cabell's seemingly docile profession of faith, which contains the usual attestation concerning his perform- ance of the requisite Christian ritual, accompanied with his bewilderment as to what it is he is worshiping. His remarks, too, are pervaded with the same note of irony as that found in the confessions of Shaftesbury and of Diderot. I need but tell you that I am a communicant of the Protestant Episcopal Church of America. I accept its creeds (both of them; and including of course the Thirty-Nine articles) in so far as I can understand their statements, quite possibly true. The remaining and the major portions of the tenets of my church I regard as indisputable, if but because they convey to me no earthly meaning, and nobody can dispute the incomprehensible. You cannot, for example, rationally deny that you believe in the Holy Ghost until somebody has provided you with some faint notion of the Holy Ghost. Pending that, I find no great difficulty in accepting his existence, very much as I accept the existence of the Amir of Afghanistan, without forming any mental concept of either.19 At times, Cabell's attitude seems to resemble that of Rous- seau, who, occasionally, came close to embracing orthodox Christianity, as he did, for example in his touching and beauti- ful " Profession de foi du vicaire Savoyard," which Cabell must certainly have known, for students of French literature are introduced to this beautiful passage from Emile early in their careers. In this work devoted to the education of a young man, Rousseau had written: Je vous avoue aussi que la sainteté de l'Évangile est un argu- ment qui parle à mon coeur, et duquel j'aurois même regret de trouver quelque bonne réponse. . . . Voyez les livres des philosophes avec toute leur pompe: qu'ils sont petits près de celui-là! Se peut-il qu'un livre à la fois si sublime et si simple soit l'ouvrage des hommes? . . . Est-ce là le ton d'un enthousiaste ou d'un ambitieux sectaire? Quelle douceur, quelle pureté dans ses moeurs! quelle grace touchante dans ses instructions! . . . quelle profonde sagesse dans ses discours! quelle présence d'esprit, quelle finesse et quelle justice dans ses réponses! quel empire sur ses passions! Où est l'homme, où est le sage qui sait agir, souffrir et mourir sans foiblesse et sans ostentation?

God of my grandmother [says Jurgen], I cannot quite believe in You, and Your doings as they are recorded I find incoherent and a little droll. Yet I am glad the affair has been so arranged that You may always now be real to brave and gentle persons who have believed in and have worshiped and have loved You. God of my grandmother, I cannot quite believe in You, yet I am not as those who would come peering at you reasonably. I, Jurgen, see you only through a mist of tears. For You were loved by those whom I loved greatly very long ago. . . . And it seems to me that dates and manuscripts and the opinions of learned persons are very trifling things beside what I remember, and what I envy! 21 Sometimes, as in Beyond Life , Cabell looked upon the Bible as a vast Cinderella tale which ends in a " very public triumph celebrated amid the unimaginable pomp and fanfare of the vision seen from Patmos." 22 In fact, he usually considered Christianity as " a product of romance, and the Bible as the masterpiece of romance." 23 He felt that if the events in the Bible did really happen, they prove " that our world is swayed by a Romancer of incalculable skill and imagination." 24 This attitude would seem to lend support to the contention that Cabell had a positive belief in Christianity, were it not followed by book upon book in which Cabell poked fun at Holy Writ. For example, in one of his subsequent works, he called a saint whom he had created " Holmendis," 25 obviously meaning to suggest by this name that the latter's function was to mend the holes in " Hol-e-y " Writ. 20 Arman d-Aubrée (ed.) , Oeuvres complètes de J. -J.

Schlegel Fundamentally, the quarrel which most Enlighteners have with religion is with the pettiness of human conceptions and with the excesses of religious fanaticism. Perhaps Cabell's mis- take, like that of most intellectuals, was in expecting the rank and file of mankind to think in abstract terms. Cabell, then, did have much in common with the long line of Illuminati, who had their heyday in the eighteenth century, although this type of thinking has had its representatives throughout much of recorded time. Cabell was writing in a definite literary tradition - a tradition which was at its most explicit in the work of the eighteenth-century French Enlight- eners. While the sceptics, the self-appointed Enlighteners, in any society are frequently feared and disliked by the masses of men, yet they do perform a valuable function. By making men take a look at their own assumptions and behavior, they provide a valuable antidote against dogmatism and fanaticism, which can become dangerous if allowed to rage unrestrained or if it is misapplied. In the present century, for example, many Funda- mentalists in the South have used the Bible to support their belief that segregation is the will of God. The agnostic serves to counteract the complacency which can lead to stagnation, inflexibility, and cruelty. On the other hand, religion, if wisely and sanely followed, can give men the hope and charity which are sorely needed in all stages of human history. Perhaps the best solution for both groups, the believers and the skeptics, is to practice the tolerance and forbearance which the great progenitor of the Christian religion tried to instill into his followers during his own lifetime and which people have largely ignored. The qualities which he preached would provide the synthesis of the two extremes. Norfolk State College Norfolk , Virginia</page></plain_text>
