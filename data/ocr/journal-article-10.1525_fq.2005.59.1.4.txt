Characteristic of the Sillies is how in the course of adapting a single story, Disney will strike chords from many, many others. Here the Hansel and Gretel story is combined with rescuing dwarfs framed inside a Just-So ballad about the origins of a stone formation called “Witch Rock.” But by the time the cartoon is done, we’ve had glancing references to everything from “Rip Van Winkle,” “Snow White,” and Il Trovatore to Victor Herbert operetta, Universal horror movies, and a pastiche of vaudeville, burlesque, and silent comedy routines. What binds the movie together is a deceptively simple circular structure in which the second part of the tale inverts the first, and the whole story ends where it began. Two children are lost in the woods, dark and spooky. But the frights are not what they seem.

But however marked, this kind of configuration re- mains remarkably constant in Disney shorts. Part of the critical enjoyment is to see how many variations of this pattern Disney can plot; another pleasure is to see where the formula leads. Snow White literally starts and ends with two castles at the opposite edges of a forest where, as in Babes in the Woods, the dwarf cottage pro- vides a counter-home to the wicked queen’s domain.

Here it is Mother who frames the adventure by tending to her baby as the little one drifts off to sleep. The singing cho- rus in Babes is reconfigured as a mother’s maternal spirit hovering over the dream in the voice of a lulling female trio. The trio sings words of reassurance, advice, and caution as Baby makes its perilous journey across a dream landscape called the Land of Nowhere. The Land of Nowhere is our forest redressed in toddler imagery (it is also the first of the countrysides, followed by Music Land, The Cookie Carnival, andWho Killed Cock Robin? given thematic décor), bordered by one terminal (the Forbidden Garden) where the child is Three bogey monsters ready to entertain and terrify Baby  threatened with bodily harm and even annihilation, in Lullaby Land 9 © Disney Enterprises, Inc. © Disney Enterprises, Inc. </page> <page sequence="7"> tation, and is then expelled from the garden in cleans- ing water. But the eeriness of Baby’s journey may derive from even more fundamental tensions that the cartoon continually keeps in play. Behind the sugariness, Dis- ney maintains the contradiction of a lullaby where Baby is told two incompatible things: Mother loves and cares for Baby, but Mother is about to abandon Baby. Baby is being sent to oblivion—a “Lullaby Land of Nowhere”— with “Lullaby Land” signposts pointing in all directions, signs that would be useless even if Baby could read. It is a strange world of quilted meadows and talcum-powder bushes fashioned by all-powerful adults meant to pacify and comfort the infant, but a world which reprimands as soon as Baby tries to engage with it in any way—whether by exploring, trying out a ham- Signposts to oblivion on a bedspread-meadow in Lullaby Land mer, or playing with matches.

Three Little Pigs is closer to the repeat pattern of a nursery rhyme or toddler culture in general, a pattern that extends to the heroes them- selves—brothers who, like the later Disney toddlers Wynken, Blynken, and Nod, are virtual clones of each other. Homes are destroyed, one after another, but the pigs simply start over again, back in another home. Which brings us to yet another curious aspect of the film: the developmental stage of the pigs. Like Pinocchio, these pigs are part-toddler, part-adolescent —old enough to build their own houses, decorate them with girlie pictures and prize-fighter portraits, yet young enough to have high voices and be dressed in pre-schooler sailor jackets and oversize bow ties. Except for Practical Pig, they are not old enough to wear trousers.

ABSTRACT Disney broke away from gag-centered cartoons in favor of fantasy narrative in his Silly Symphony cartoon series, produced in the 1930s. In landmark Symphonies such as The Ugly Duckling, Babes in the Woods, Lullaby Land,Who Killed Cock Robin?, and Three Little Pigs he explores with remarkable potency the inner life of  the child—dramatizing the child’s issues of separation, sense of shame, struggle to control impulses, fear of annihilation, and love  of adventure. 17 </page> </plain_text>
