<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NEW COLLEGE MANUSCRIPT OF THOREAU'S CARL BODE University of Maryland "RENCH I HAVE certainly neglected, Dan Homer is all the rage at present," Henry David Thoreau wrote from Concord to a college classmate in August, near the end of the summer vacationi of I836. When Thoreau returned to Cambridge the next month as a Senio;r Sophister, both the Harvard College Library and the college curriculum helped to further his interest in Homer. The curriculum was still heavily weighted in favor of the classics. It included the course work in Greek literature, which Thoreau had taken under C. C. Felton, Eliot Professor of Greek Literature, editor of Homer, and ultimately president of Harvard. Of Felton one colleague has written benignly, "Such students as were dis- posed to love classical literature were drawn to him by an elective affinity." Jones Very, too, tutor in Greek to underclassmen, was earnestly, even anxiously, interested in the students and was extremely successful with some of them. The college library also furnished Thoreau with grist for the Homeric mill. In this classical atmosphere he drew from the library on September I5 a book mainly about the Iliad and Odyssey that may well have had considerable attraction for him. It was Henry Nelson Coleridge's Introductions to the Study of the Greek Classic Poets.1 Two weeks later Thoreau had finished a two-thousand-word synoptic review of Coleridge's book. The fair copy that Thoreau made of this paper, dated October i, I836, is now in the Henry E. Huntington Library and has never before been published. The manuscript of five leaves closely written on both sides is in Thoreau's college hand and came to the Huntington Library as part of a group of college essays, the rest of which have seen print elsewhere.2 Most if not all of these other college essays were written for E. T. Chan- ning's classes in composition; several bear marks of his correction in the margin. Thoreau turned in papers for Channing's course in forensics on October i and October I5, but two thousand words is much too long for exercises like these. Thoreau, furthermore, had no part in the 'Designed principally for the use of young persons at school and college (London: John Murray, Albemarle Street, MDCCCXXX). The volume was designated as Part I, and Coleridge advertised that he hoped "to continue these Introductions through the whole body of Greek Classical Poetry"; but no other parts appeared. He was a nephew and associate of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and edited some of his works. 2 See especially F. B. Sanborn, The Life of Henry David Thoreau (Boston and New York, 1917), pp. 66-i88, passim.</page><page sequence="2">312 American Literature college exhibition of the same month; so the occasion for which this paper was composed is difficult to determine.3 He may have done it for some other class; however, the course in Greek is not listed as being given to seniors at this time.4 Perhaps it was intended for one of the ephemeral literary societies that developed every now and then in the college. Or Thoreau may have written it simply for his own use. He often made abstracts and even copied extended quotations into his commonplace books, and the fact that the paper is unsigned is an argument for this view. Although the care with which the manuscript was prepared, the even lines, and the clean copy argue that the writing was not done for Thoreau's eyes alone, this may be due merely to schoolboy orderliness- a quality that Professor Channing strove to inculcate. A commonplace book of Thoreau's, now also in the Huntington Library, contains several similar pieces of work apparently transcribed with equal care. Copied into the commonplace book at about the same time that Thoreau was reading Henry Coleridge, they are like the present manuscript in for- mat and method, and they too may not have seen print. The most inter- esting of these, in terms of the way Thoreau was to develop, summarizes and comments upon William Howitt's The Book of the Seasons.5 The style of the Coleridge paper, like that of the commonplace book selections, shows further evidence of the iron training given in Chan- ning's classroom. Many sentences are balanced; some are periodic. The antitheses that seem neat instead of arid to the student are used liberally. "We see with Dante but we feel with Milton," Thoreau writes, for ex- ample, probably with some satisfaction at the phrasing. Various tricks of academic style are present. In some places Coleridge is responsible because Thoreau is following his wording without benefit of quotation marks, but the style is still the kind that Channing inculcated. Ten years, probably to a day, after Thoreau copied out his Coleridge paper, he was working on the early draft of Walden. There, even among the many cancellations and emendations, his style has all the individual felicity for which he was later famous. It took him nearly a decade, though, to recover from Channing's well intended literary discipline. Here, it follows, is Thoreau the college student, demonstrating to the reader of today more of diligence than talent. As an example of the creative, adult Thoreau, this manuscript, conse- quently, has no significance. Much of the material is abstracted instead 3 Letter of April 14, 1947, from Mr. C. K.

But as an early indication of some of Thoreau's most vital interests, the manuscript has considerable value. The choice of subject is important in several ways. First, it attests to Thoreau's youthful interest in classical literature. Over the years he was to demonstrate a devotion to the classics unmatched among his peers. His reading list of classical authors, num- bering half a hundred, included every great name from AEschylus to Xenophon. His first published article was on a classical poet, Aulus Persius Flaccus; his first book, the Week, he filled with classical quota- tions and allusions. Even toward the end of his life, when he became primarily a reporter of nature, the classics still occupied a warm spot in his heart. There is a penciled notation pasted in his Journal for May, i86i-barely a year before his death-to the effect that he has read the Greek geographer Strabo "as far as 3o6th p." Second, this manuscript foreshadows Thoreau's concern with the role of the poet in life and the function of poetry. Surviving scraps of Thoreau's earliest Journals in- clude characteristic entries headed merely "Homer" but actually dealing in general with the poet and poetry. While he was still in his twenties Thoreau came to the conclusion that his formal task was to be a poet, and he developed in connection with his calling a substantial body of poetic theory. It is not such a very great distance from either Henry Coleridge's "General Introduction" on poetry or the Homeric matters he discussed in the body of his book, to the poetics of Henry Thoreau. The third significance, less marked than the first two, lies in his careful copy- ing of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's celebrated distinction between Fancy and Imagination as restated in his nephew's little volume. Thoreau, on his way to becoming a Transcendentalist, could find this distinction a highly stimulating one. "Imagination takes and moulds the objects of nature at the same moment"-this, for instance, was suggestive doctrine for the Transcendentalist-to-be. 21 Vol. 21</page><page sequence="4">314 American Literature INTRODUCTIONS6 TO THE STUDY OCT IST I836. OF THE GREEK CLASSIC POETS. BY HENRY NELSON COLERIDGE, ESQ. M. A. LATE FELLOW OF KING'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE. PART I "My wish" says the author, "is to enable the youthful student to form a more just and liberal judgment of the characters and merits of the Greek Poets, than he has commonly an opportunity of doing at school; and for that purpose to habituate his mind to sound prin- ciples of literary criticism."7 If the book and not the author be the subject of our criticism, we must not only divest ourselves of all local prejudices, we must forget the master-spirit, we must set aside for the moment all those associations which delight to hover around the humble domicil of the bard of olden time, and now and then perchance, impudently to peep in upon him in his musings, we must regard only those qualities which know no change, whose excellence will be as manifest to ages yet to come as they have been to those past. Among which last are enumerated, Imagination, Fancy, Good Sense, and Purity of Language. Our author draws a very nice distinction between the first 2 of these. He conceives Shakespeare's description of Queen Mab to be an instance of the exercise of pure Fancy. "But the mode and direction of the pro- found madness of Lear," he observes, "flow from the Imagination of the Poet alone."8 "In the first of these passages the images taken from objects of nature or art are presented as they are; they are neither modified nor associated; they are, in fact, so many pretty shows passed through a magic lantern, without any connection with the being and feelings of the Speaker or the Poet impressed upon them; we look at them, but cannot for a moment feel for, or with them. In the second, the images are transfigured; their colors and shapes are modified; one master passion pervades and quickens 6 Publication of this manuscript is by courtesy of the Huntington Library.

Sometimes Thoreau will quote inexactly; at other times he may, as is pointed out above, neglect to set off quotations with quotation marks. 8lIbid., P. i i.</page><page sequence="5">A New College Manuscript of Thoreau's 315 them; and in them all it is the wild and heart-stricken Father-king that speaks alone.-Fancy collects materials from the visible world, and arranges them for exhibition, but it imparts to them no touch of human interest; Imagination takes and moulds the objects of na- ture at the same moment; it makes them all speak the language of man, and renders them instinct with the inspired breath of human passion."9 One of the peculiar features of the poetry of the Greeks and Romans may be traced to the influences of a national Mythol- ogy, differing materially from that system of Polytheism which ob- tained among the more Northern tribes. The former inhabiting a luxurious clime, breathing a balmy and fragrant air, accustomed to the wildest profusion and riotous aboundance, passing their time, mostly, in the open air, now stretched at length by the mossy fount and lulled asleep by its murmurings, now whiling away the hour in amorous lays that find an echo in the neighboring grove, the crea- tures of Imagination, saw in the spring which slaked their thirst some gentle nymph or Naiad. A Pan or Satyr had a hand in every sound that broke upon the stillness of the glade. Wanting a visible type, a sensible figure to which to direct his prayers and before which to offer up the firstlings of the flock or the first fruits of the harvest, the southern hind had recourse to symbolical images. This tendency to what has been called Anthropomorphism, this appetite for visible images is a peculiar feature in the character of the South- erns at the present day, as the violent opposition to the famous Iconoclasts can testify. In the nations of Scandinavian or Teutonic descent a different tendency may be noticed. The scenery that surrounded them was stern and rugged, the face of nature presented little that was attractive, little to charm the eye, the towering peak, the awful sublimity of a Northern tempest, their dark and craggy dells, their boundless and almost impenetrable forests, cast a shade of awe and mystery over the beholder. Their conceptions were as subtle and unapproachable as their own mountain mists; every re- tired glen, every beetling crag, every dark unfathomable abyss, had its peculiar spirit; the open air was the temple of their divinity, no human structure, no tangible symbol, was compatible with their mystical conceptions of an over-ruling power. It is this neglect of the material, this fondness for the dark and mysterious, this pro- pensity to the spiritual, that marks every page of Milton and his 9Ibid., pp. 12, 13.</page><page sequence="6">3I6 American Literature kindred spirits. We see with Dante but we feell [sic] with Milton. The conception and expression of the passion of Love form an- other distinguishing feature in the poetry of old and modern times. Our author concludes his "General Introduction" with the fol- lowing apostrophe. "Greek-the shrine of the genius of the old world; as universal as our race, as individual as ourselves; of infinite flexibility, of indefatigable strength, with the complication and the distinctness of nature herself; to which nothing was vulgar, from which nothing was excluded; speaking to the ear like Italian, speak- ing to the mind like English; with words like pictures, with words like the gossamer film of the summer; at once the variety and pic- turesqueness of Homer, the gloom and the intensity of Eschylus; not compressed to the closest by Thucydides, not fathomed to the bot- tom by Plato, not sounding with all its thunders, nor lit up with all its ardors even under the Promethean touch of Demosthenes! And Latin-the voice of empire and of war, of law and of the state; in- ferior to its half-parent and rival in the embodying of passion and in the distinguishing of thought, but equal to it in sustaining the measured march of history, and superior to it in the indignant decla- mation of moral satire; stamped with the mark of an imperial and despotizing republic; rigid in its construction, parsimonious in its synonymes; reluctantly yielding to the flowery yoke of Horace, al- though opening glimpses of Greek-like splendor in the occasional inspirations of Lucretius; proved, indeed, to the uttermost by Cicero, and by him found wanting; yet majestic in its bareness, impressive in its conciseness; the true language of History, instinct with the spirit of nations, and not with the passions of individuals; breathing the maxims of the world, and not the tenets of the schools; one and uniform in its air and spirit, whether touched by the stern and haughty Sallust, by the open and discursive Livy, by the reserved and thoughtful Tacitus."'10 &amp;c. It is not a matter of perfect indifference to us how or by whom the supposed works of Homer were really composed. The personal existence of Homer, as the author of the Iliad, was first questioned about the close of the i7th century, by 2 Frenchmen, Hedelin and Perrault, who were the first to suggest the outlines of a theory, which has since been developed by Heyne. According to this theory the Iliad was not the composition of a single individual, but is 10lbid., pp. 34-35.</page><page sequence="7">A New College Manuscript of Thoreau's 317 a compilation, methodized and arranged by successive editors. Hedelin maintains that the Iliad was made up "ex tragoediis et variis canticis de trivio, mendicorum et circulatorum, a la maniere des chansons de Pont neuf."" Wolfe [sic] believed it to have been made by one Homer, but in short rhapsodies, unconnected with each other, and afterwards put together. The argument founded on the casual remarks of Grecian writers is said to prove too much that besides the Iliad, Odyssey, Batrachomachia, Hymns and Epigrams, at least 20* other poems were in former times ascribed to Homer -that ma[n]y passages of these, yet preserved, contain direct con- tradictions of the tenor of the Iliad-that many of the ancients who did not doubt the genuineness of the Iliad, doubted and denied that of the Odyssey. Mr. Coleridge thinks it grossly improbable that even the single Iliad, amounting to I5000 lines, should have been conceived and perfected by one man without the aid of writing materials. All the accounts we have of Homer concur in represent- ing him as a Rhapsodist of the first race. These minstrels or reciters were termed 'Paw/wsoL, either because they worked together their own or other's verses and published them, as it were, in something like a connected form; or because they held a staff ( a3Sov) in their hands when about to recite. Subsequently to this came a second race of Rhapsodists whose occupation it was to learn by heart and recite such verses of other authors as had become popular, making it a practice to alter their originals as they pleased. The most cele- brated of this race were the Homeridae who had their headquarters in the island of Chios, and pretended to be the correctest reciters of the verses of Homer. Some say that the poems of Homer were first brought to Sparta from Asia by Lycurgus; among whom are Heraclides Ponticus, Alian, and Plutarch. But the better founded account is, that Pisistratus with the help of ma[n]y of the most celebrated poets of his age, first made a regular collection of the different Rhapsodies which passed under Homer's name, and arranged them very much in the series in which we now possess 11Ibid., p. 39. * Amazonia.

(The division into books corresponding with the letters of the alphabet, our author supposes to have been the work of the Alexandrian critics manner [sic] centuries later.) Some of the authorities for this account are Cicero, Pausanias, AElian, Libanius, Eustathius, and the Scholiast. Hipparchus is supposed to have com- pleted the work which Solon had begun, and Pisistratus had prin- cipally executed. This will embrace about 8o years from the date of Solon's law, B.C. 594, to the death of Hipparchus the son of Pisistratus, B.C. 5I3. In his summary our author observes that there are 3 points of view in which this collection may be placed;- i "That Homer wrote the Iliad in its present form-that by means of the desultory recitations of parts only by the itinerant Rhapsodists, its original unity of form was lost in Western Greece-and that P and his son did no more than collect all those parts and re-arrange them in their primitive order:- 2. That Homer wrote the existing verses constituting the Iliad in such short songs or rhapsodies as he, himself an itinerant rhapsodist, could sing or recite separately, and that these songs were for the first time put into one body, and dis- posed in their Epic form, by Pisistratus, as aforesaid:- 3. That sev- eral Rhapsodists originally composed the songs out of which, or with which, the Iliad as a Poem was compiled."'2 "The first is the com- mon opinion, and is supported by Mr. Granville Penn, in his "Pri- mary Argument of the Iliad:" the second is Wolfe's and Bentley's; the last is Heyne's, and was, I believe, the opinion of the late Dr. Parr, and is, I know, the firm conviction of one or 2 of the most eminent English poets and philosophers of the present day."13 There were many editions, or Atop9ow-ts, of the Iliad after this primary one by the Pisistratidae. One by Antimachus; another by Aristotle, which Alexander corrected and kept in a precious casket taken amongst the spoils of the camp of Darius, which was called v iK TO0 v pOqxos. Those by any known individual were called at xar' av pa to distinguish them from several existing in different cities, but not attributed to any particular editors which were called at KarTaf 7roAXs or at (K E'ro'Xv. For further information the student is advised to read Heyne's Excursus, Wolfe's and Knight's Prolegomenas. The second contains a complete account of all that can be now discovered with respect to the Homeric Poems, and also exhibits a masterly 12 bid., p. 53. 8 Ibid., PP. 53-54.</page><page sequence="9">A New College Manuscript of Thoreau's 3I9 sketch of the ancient criticism. The first is full of various and use- ful information. The last is a kind of judgment on the theories of the preceding by an eminent, though eccentric scholar. So much for the Homeric question. Of numerous biographies of Homer nothing now remains, with the exception of one attributed, though falsely, to Herodotus, and another to Plutarch, which, like the former, is generally condemned as a forgery. One thing, however, seems certain, which is, that the author, or authors, of the Iliad, was, or were, born and bred in Asiatic Greece. Of this, says C, there is plenty of good evidence in the Iliad itself, and beyond that everything seems as merely fabulous as the popular stories of King Arthur. Ephorus says he was called Homer when he became blind, from his being the follower of a guide (o qpos). Aristotles [sic] account is, that the Lydians being pressed by the 2Eolians, and resolving to abandon Smyrna, made a proclamation, that whoever wished to follow them should go out of the city, and that thereupon Melesigenes said he would follow or accompany them (06Mzpav). Another derivation is from o pmq" 6pXv. Another from 0 1qpOs, because he had some mark on his thigh to denote his ille- gitimacy. Proclus says that the Poet was delivered up by the people of Smyrna to Chios as a hostage (O,UvpoS). The derivation that favors the theories both of Wolfe and Heyne is from 6,o3V dtpctv-to speak together, or 6au-pEv-assemble together. But these are mere conjectures. Mr. C thinks that the Iliad is, with the exception of the Pentateuch and some other books of the Old Testament, the most ancient composition known. According to Wood, Haller, and Milford [Mitford], H. lived about the middle of the gth century before Christ. That the Odyssey is not of the same age, or by the same hands as the Iliad, is one of the positions of the German theory, which has been countenanced by many great scholars as probable, if not absolutely demonstrated. Their argu- ments are chiefly drawn from internal evidence. The Margites, a satire upon some strenuous blockhead, which does not now exist, is also attributed to H. The Batrachomyo- machia, or the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, is a short mock-heroic poem of ancient date. The Homeric Hymns, which were discovered in the last century at Moscow, amount to 33, but, with the exception</page><page sequence="10">320 American Literature of those to Apollo, Mercury, Venus, and Ceres, are so short as not to consist of more than about 350 lines in all. Under the title of Epigrams are classed a few verses on different subjects chiefly ad- dressed to cities or private individuals. In general, the songs in Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Waller, and where he writes with sim- plicity, in Moore, give a better notion of the Greek Epigrams than any other species of modern composition. The subject of the Little Iliad was the continuation of the Trojan war from the death of Hector, but fragments only remain. I836 OCT IST CAMBRIDGE.</page></plain_text>
