<plain_text><page sequence="1">11 PUBLIC CHOICE AND THE RULE OF LAW: RATIONAL CHOICE THEORIES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION JACK KNIGHT AND JAMES JOHNSON I. Introduction In this chapter we consider a number of recent efforts to em ploy rational choice models to support normative theories of statutory interpretation.1 These efforts are grounded in the public choice tradition, which has developed a conception of politics in a democratic society that calls into question many of the bases of the legitimacy of the rule of law. This tradition has been interpreted to argue that statutes, as the product of politi cal competition that aggregates individual preferences into col lective outcomes, are incoherent as a statement of the general will of the people in a democratic society.2 What makes these new efforts especially important is that they attempt to incorpo rate the conclusions of the public choice tradition in theories of how courts should interpret statutes. In doing so, they seek to salvage the normative legitimacy of the rule of law in a demo We share equal responsibility for any errors and equal credit for any insights in this chapter. 244</page><page sequence="2">PUBLIC CHOICE AND THE RULE OF LAW 245 cratic society in the face of the public choice challenge to that le gitimacy. Several approaches have been proposed to resolve the inco herence problem and to sustain the legitimacy of statutory inter pretation. Two types of arguments are offered in support of the different approaches: (1) that the proposed approaches are best able to aid the courts in furthering the underlying purposes of democratically elected officials; and (2) that the approaches will produce better and more coherent legislation because of the interactive effects of the courts on the actions of legislatures. What we consider here is whether these public choice-based theories of statutory interpretation sustain a claim that the judi cial interpretations are entitled to normative legitimacy. In the next section we briefly sketch the nature of the prob lem as formulated by the public choice literature. In sections 3 and 4 we consider three proposals for how courts can develop a coherent vision of statutory enactments of the legislature. In the third section we assess to what extent these proposals are successful in meeting the challenge to democratic legitimacy. In the fourth section we consider the extent to which courts that adopt one of these approaches can have a salutary effect on the nature of the legislative process and, thus, enhance legitimacy. II. The Role of Courts in a Democracy "What is the best way for a court to act in a democracy?"3 This is the question that motivates much of the recent rational choice work on judicial interpretation. In matters of a constitutional nature, the question can imply a tension between democracy and the rule of law: when constitutional review of statutes leads to a court overturning the enactments of democratically elected officials. In matters of statutory interpretation, the question can be interpreted to imply a tension, but it can also be seen to envision a close relationship between democracy and the rule of law: when courts are asked to discern the meaning of a statute enacted by elected legislators. In the constitutional case, the legitimacy of judicial decision making rests on the connection between the court's decision and the Constitution; in statutory cases, the legitimacy rests on the connection between the court's</page><page sequence="3">246 Jack Knight and James Johnson interpretation and the actions of the elected representatives of the people. Note here that, in the case of statutory law, the underlying legitimacy of the court's decision rests on the democratic pro cess itself. This introduces two distinct questions. First, how, and under what conditions, do democratic procedures bestow legitimacy on law? Second, if democracy is the source of legiti macy, from whence do the interpretations and pronouncements of nondemocratic bodies derive their legitimacy? While the questions are distinct, the answer to the second is dependent on the answer to the first. If the conditions have been satisfied for democratic procedures to produce normatively legitimate statutes, then the court's interpretations of those statutes will also be legitimate as long as they relate in the proper way to the actions of elected officials. If the conditions have not been satisfied, then the question becomes one of whether there is something the court can do to enhance the legitimacy of statutes by relating its decision to those actions of legislators most likely to bestow legitimacy. The key phrase here is "relate in the proper way." In their chapter in this volume, Eskridge and Ferejohn divide contem porary jurisprudential theories of statutory interpretation into three basic categories: original intent (interpretation should be consistent with the original intent of the enacting legislature), new textualism (interpretation should be consistent with the language of the text), and dynamic (interpretation should re flect the fact that statutes change over time to accommodate changes in society's norms and values.)4 Each of these ap proaches establishes a different way for the court's decision to relate to the actions of elected officials. But, for our purposes here, it is sufficient to note that all of the approaches rest on some fundamental notion that courts will derive their legitimacy in statutory interpretation by trying to relate their decisions to the underlying purposes of democratically elected officials. Conceptualizing the problem of legitimacy in this way allows us to see the argumentative strategy of rational choice theories of statutory interpretation. These accounts establish with con siderable clarity the complicated relationship between these two questions of legitimacy. Since the first question focuses on the</page><page sequence="4">PUBLIC CHOICE AND THE RULE OF LAW 247 democratic process itself, some account of how democratic pro cedures produce legitimacy must be offered. Each of the ratio nal choice accounts is stymied in this effort by the challenges of the public choice literature. Thus, the key to their attempts to offer a normative theory of statutory interpretation rests on their ability to recommend a method of judicial decision making that will connect a court's decisions to those actions of legislators that will overcome the problems raised by the public choice critique of democracy. Most rational choice accounts make an argument for the legitimacy of law that is based on the production of law through proper institutional procedures: if the law is the product of fair, public procedures, then it is entitled to some form of special consideration. This resolution is theoretically grounded in these accounts' notion of democracy and is aligned with the legal process school of jurisprudence.5 Ferejohn and Weingast pre sent the most fully developed formulation of this argument. Consider the following passage, in which they set out the prob lem of the legitimacy of the rule of law: The rule of law .. . requires that conduct be regulated by a system of impartial public rules whose consequences can be fore seen and anticipated. Such a system must be coherent if it is to have predictable consequences for individuals. The design of an optimal "coherence" test remains a central question in jurispru dence, but most versions require at least some degree of rational ity: that legal commands be understood as rational requirements imposed by the state for some comprehensible purpose, a pur pose of a sort that could actually be held by a single individual. Classical collective choice theory suggests that this coherence is, in principle, unobtainable in a democratic state.6 The main thrust of the passage is that law produced by a demo cratic body lacks the coherence necessary for it to have norma tive force. The major results of the public choice literature are well known.7 Democracy is treated as a process by which individual preferences are aggregated into a collective decision, either a specific outcome or an ordering of the preferences of the group. Many early theorems, the most seminal of which is Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, demonstrate that any aggrega</page><page sequence="5">248 Jack Knight and James Johnson tion mechanism that satisfies some standard conditions of fair ness will fail at times to produce a coherent collective ordering. In the case of majority rule procedures, additional studies show that the conditions for the existence of a majority rule equilib rium, defined by Riker and Weingast as "a social choice such that individuals in the group, each acting to achieve the highest obtainable outcomes in his or her preference order, will arrive at a given social choice and, once arrived, will have no incentive to look for something better,"8 are very restrictive. These re sults imply that democratic procedures will produce cycling at the level of group preferences and, therefore, that the outcomes of such a process will be highly contingent on the particular institutional procedures (e.g., who sets the agenda) under which the decision is made. This contingency leads to the conclusion that political outcomes are the product of strategic manipula tion and that democracy is merely a process of political competi tion. Such a conclusion undermines the claim that the products of the democratic process represent the collective interest and are therefore infused with normative legitimacy. Thus, theories of statutory interpretation that rest their views of the legislative process on the lessons of public choice theory face considerable obstacles in establishing conditions under which democratic procedures can bestow normative legitimacy on statutes. Nonetheless, these various accounts seek to main tain a relationship between democracy and the legitimacy of statutory law. For example, Ferejohn and Weingast opt for what they say is a "practical" solution based on what democracy requires of the rule of law: "the commands issued by a sover eign and fairly chosen legislature have some claim to be obeyed by a democratic people. And this is true even of a legislature long since deceased."9 Thus, the product of a democratic legis lature is entitled to some special deference from the people and, therefore, from the courts. In an important way this shifts the burden of establishing legitimacy onto the courts: the task for the courts here is to find an interpretive strategy that will (1) enhance the coherence of legislative pronouncements by dis cerning the underlying purpose of the legislators and (2) justify the claims of legitimacy. To see how this shifting of the burden works, we can briefly</page><page sequence="6">PUBLIC CHOICE AND THE RULE OF LAW 249 consider Judge Frank Easterbrook's recommendation that judges act as "honest agents" of the legislature.10 On this ac count, insofar as courts advance the intent of the enacting legis lature, judicial pronouncements can claim legitimacy. Further more, it locates the judiciary within the lawmaking process in such a way that by adopting particular interpretive stances it can be seen as enhancing or hindering deliberative activity within legislative bodies. An initial problem with this recommendation seems related to the challenge of public choice theory. An agent, after all, presupposes a principal.11 The public choice results on incoher ence and instability appear to rule out treating legislatures in such an "anthropomorphic fashion."12 There thus is a tension here as well as in the other accounts between the view of the court as an agent of the legislature and skepticism about whether the legislature possesses the requisite coherence to be a principal. But Judge Easterbrook dispels much of this tension by re formulating the way courts conceive of the legislative process. He recommends that [j]udges must be honest agents of the political branches. They carry out decisions they do not make. Judges who appreciate the economics of legislation and the markets will be good agents as well as honest ones. Good agents reduce the costs of implement ing laws. Reduce the cost of anything and you get more. So good judges make it easier for the political branches to strike compromises, to enact new laws.13 By recommending that, in addition to being "honest" agents, courts be "good" ones as well, he suggests how, by shifting metaphors, public choice-based theories of statutory interpreta tion might mitigate the tension mentioned above. A good agent facilitates contracting by legislative bargainers. With this change of metaphor—from aggregation to contracting and bar gaining—the supposed incoherence of the legislative process becomes tractable.</page><page sequence="7">250 Jack Knight and James Johnson III. Potential Solutions to the Coherence Problem The Easterbrook example represents merely one of a number of ways that recent rational choice accounts have proposed to enhance the coherence of statutes. In the next two sections we consider three such alternatives: (1) statutes as contracts, (2) statutes as bargains that are enhanced by conventions, and (3) statutes as pronouncements that are supplemented by public values. In this section we assess the alternatives in terms of their ability to highlight and emphasize aspects of the legislative process that enhance the coherence and legitimacy of statutes. In the next section we briefly consider the extent to which they enhance the legitimacy of the democratic process through their effects on legislative deliberation. Contracts Many rational choice accounts treat statutes as contracts that codify agreements generated by bargaining processes within a legislature.14 On this view the task of statutory interpretation is consistently to identify and support the intent of the particular coalition comprised of legislators who are parties to the original statutory bargain.15 This, of course, raises an obvious difficulty in that a coalition can no more have a unified purpose or expec tation than can a larger legislative body. One strength of this approach is that it squarely faces this difficulty and generates a rather interesting set of interpretive canons intended to identify those members of the enacting coalition whose preferences were especially important in shaping particular statutory bar gains. The expressed preferences and expectations of these "pivotal" actors become the key to reconstructing legislative intent.16 McNollgast justifies the focus on "pivotal" legislative actors through an analysis of how different interpretive stances adopted by the courts can effect legislative decision making. They use a consequentialist normative criterion to discriminate among the various possible interpretive stances. Here the anal ogy between producing statutes on the one hand and con</page><page sequence="8">PUBLIC CHOICE AND THE RULE OF LAW 251 tracting on the other exerts considerable force. That interpre tive stance that best works to "facilitate legislative agreements and insure the efficiency of the legislative process" by enforcing original expectations and constraining strategic communication is deemed superior.17 A view of courts as agents, both honest and good, of the legislature obviously fits comfortably here. An honest agent is concerned with the expectations and pref erences of the original parties. In statutory interpretation this means that courts should, within constraints imposed by the strategic setting in which they find themselves, rule on behalf of the enacting rather than the current or sitting legislature. This distinction allows us to see that while the court may in fact act contrary to the "majoritarian whims" of the current legislature, it does so in the name of an earlier majority. It is by establishing this connection to the intent of the enacting legislative coalition that Ferejohn and Weingast hope to establish the legitimacy of judicial pronouncements and, thereby, "provide a practical response to the theoretical tension between law and de mocracy." 18 Unfortunately, the laws-as-contracts approach fails ade quately to resolve the coherence problem. This becomes appar ent if we look more closely at the interpretive canons that McNollgast suggests will enable the court to determine the in tent of the enacting legislature. Recall that these canons focus less on the goals and expectations articulated by "ardent sup porters" of legislation than on the role of "pivotal" legislators. Specifically, these canons focus attention on the compromises and accommodations that ardent legislators are forced to make in order to garner the support of pivotal members.19 This is where the difficulty arises. In theory, pivotal legislators are those who hold veto power over bills by virtue of the key deci sion-making positions that they occupy. In practice this more often than not means that pivotal legislators are members of "non-representative committees with gate-keeping authority."20 What makes the authority of such committees legitimate? Ab sent a persuasive answer to this question, the law-as-contracts effort to establish the legitimacy of judicial pronouncements founders. On this account, the courts, insofar as they act as honest and</page><page sequence="9">252 Jack Knight and James Johnson good agents, are viewed as strengthening rather than obstruct ing democratic processes. This is because enhancing the efficacy of statutes is a fundamental value in a democracy because formally enacted statutes, produced according to public and fair procedures, are the best expressions of public judgements.21 Thus, the legitimacy of democratic outcomes presupposes that they can be understood as produced by normatively justifiable procedures. Efforts to treat laws as contracts face a particularly discomfiting quandary here. On the one hand they need to establish the fairness of legislative structures and processes. And on the other, their own account of these structures and pro cesses raises serious doubts about whether they can plausibly be characterized as fair. For in the first place the occupants of key committee assignments, upon whom the interpretive canons proposed by this approach center, emerge as "pivotal" members via strategic political competition that is arbitrary from a norma tive perspective. More importantly, if the legitimacy of the law is contingent on the institutional procedures that produce it, then the analysis shifts to the character of the institutional procedures. The key to the question of legitimacy focuses on an explanation of how the procedures, such as congressional committees and norms, were established. The legislative procedures upon which this claim rests are the product of bargaining by legislators with varying degrees of influence on the process. Thus they are the product of the same political process that produces other laws. If the procedures are the product of a political process that is dominated by the various asymmetries of power that character ize a society, why should those institutions be entitled to any special normative deference? And why should such a set of procedures bestow legitimacy on the fruits of that process?22 The statutes-as-contracts approach must justify the claim that these legislative contracts are more than the mere product of strategic politics. Resting the claim on a set of institutional pro cedures that is itself a political phenomenon will not satisfy this requirement.</page><page sequence="10">PUBLIC CHOICE AND THE RULE OF LAW 253 Bargains and Conventions Eskridge and Ferejohn understand that there are weaknesses in the statutes-as-contracts approach to statutory interpretation. They reject the contract metaphor on the grounds that, unlike bilateral contracts, statutes have "third-party effects."23 By this they mean to emphasize the content of legislation and the fact that statutes can produce harms for some actors. In doing so, they place greater emphasis on the bargaining aspect of the legislative process and highlight the thoroughly political nature of these statutes. Given the distributional effects of these stat utes, they reject a reliance on efficiency as the criterion by which courts can enhance the coherence of legislation. At this level their understanding is clearly an advance over the statutes-as contracts approach. To address the incoherence and legitimacy problems, they recommend that courts should adopt interpretive conventions that are welfare enhancing and that will encourage the nonstra tegic aspects of legislative behavior. Here their justification for this recommendation is somewhat unclear. On the one hand, they also introduce the efficiency like benefits of conventions: the canons are conventions ... and . .. the practice of using them can allow agents, in this case legislators, to coordinate their behavior in ways that would not be possible, or as easy, without them. A canon is efficient if its use permits the drafting and enacting of legislation that improves everyone's well-being rela tive to not using a canon. Two canons are equivalent if they permit the actors to attain identical levels of utility or well-being. Thus, we can now set forth our central idea about the canons: where each set of canons is efficient and all are equivalent, legislative agents should be indifferent as to which set of canons is em ployed in the courts as long as one of them is.24 And they emphasize these effects in their claim that such con ventions will produce a legislative environment (in which legisla tors can make clear and credible ex ante commitments as to their interpretations of the meaning of the statutes they propose) that creates greater incentives for nonstrategic and more delibera tive behavior.25</page><page sequence="11">254 Jack Knight and James Johnson On the other hand, they acknowledge that these conventions themselves can have distributive effects and that, therefore, they must be justified on independent normative grounds: we view the choice of interpretive methods and specifically the choice of canons as a choice among alternative conventions, and recognize that alternative sets of canons may lead to distributions of welfare that cannot be compared according to an efficiency criterion. The choice and defense of interpretive conventions requires normative grounding and, as efficiency notions are evi dently too weak to do the job, such grounding must be sought elsewhere in political theory.26 Thus, the general welfare-enhancing effects of interpretive con ventions will be insufficient for a justification of these conven tions as a resolution of the problems of legitimacy. This leads us to the question, what would be a sufficient justification for a court to employ a particular interpretive con vention? For a specific convention to enhance the legitimacy of statutes, it must be justified on some grounds independent of its political nature. Eskridge and Ferejohn do not take up this question, but it is, as they readily acknowledge, essential to their more general enterprise. They hint at an answer when they suggest that their proposal for interpretive conventions is in the spirit of recent proposals that interpretive canons should incorporate "public values" in statutory interpretation.27 By turning to an assessment of these proposals, we can see how difficult a task it is to justify distribution-effecting conventions on nonpolitical grounds. Public Values This third approach to the question of how courts might en hance the coherence and legitimacy of statutes recommends that courts interpret such statutes in the context of the domi nant public values that are relevant to the purpose of the stat ute. Whether formulated in terms of republican values28 or prevailing social norms,29 the various approaches that can be categorized under this heading share a belief that courts should interpret statutes as consistent with the prevailing ethical princi</page><page sequence="12">PUBLIC CHOICE AND THE RULE OF LAW 255 pies and values in a community. This assumption that legislators seek to instantiate statutes with these prevailing values allows courts to discern the underlying purpose and to enhance the coherence of those statutes. The important question to ask here is, what justifies the use of these principles by a nondemocratic body to impose meaning on a statute? That is, what is it about such principles that would lend legitimacy to statutes that were interpreted as instantiating such principles? Most accounts that advocate the use of such public values fail to answer these questions. One exception, however, is Posner's justification of this approach to judicial decision making in his more general argument in support of a pragmatic jurisprudence. While he differs from some of the other proponents in the exact principles he would employ, his account serves as the most complete existing attempt to justify the public values approach.30 Posner bases his justification on the existence of a "social consensus" around these principles.31 Thus, on his pragmatic account, the legitimacy of judicial deci sion making is a function of the extent to which there is a social consensus on the purposes and goals upon which the law is based. Given the increasingly heterogenous nature of modern soci ety, it is highly unlikely that a social consensus will exist regard ing ethical principles that might ground the interpretation of statutes. Judges who invoke consensus to justify their inter pretations thus have a difficult case to make against charges that their actions are merely political and thus lacking in legit imacy. In any event, the more fundamental question of why a social consensus should make ethical principles a source of le gitimacy in statutory interpretation cases remains to be an swered. In what sense can consensus provide justification? Consider two alternatives. First, a social consensus might be the basis of some agreement-based account: the ethical principle is legiti mate because there is a social consensus on it. Posner himself acknowledges the weaknesses of this line of argument.32 The clear objection is that consensus can be produced by power asymmetries and not through free and uncoerced choice. The power relations can work at the level of maintenance (where the</page><page sequence="13">256 Jack Knight and James Johnson dominant groups in society maintain an apparent consensus through the threat of retaliation, or the expectation of a possi ble retaliation, against deviations from that consensus) or at the level of the original development of the consensus (where the convergence on a particular ethical convention was the product of the asymmetries of power in a society). On either account, the objection undercuts a consent-based justification of ethical principles. If the "social consensus" is a function of force and not free commitment, we cannot draw normative inferences from the existence of a mere convergence on a particular ethi cal position. While Posner would seem to accept such a objection, he nevertheless maintains that social consensus is a source of legiti macy. In several places in his analysis he emphasizes the idea that "causes and justifications need not coincide."33 Thus, if the social consensus can be a source of a justification different from that of the agreement-based variety, the fact that the consensus was originally the product of power asymmetries need not de feat the other justifications. From this perspective, we should consider an alternative an swer to the question of what consensus tells us about justifica tion—it may be evidence of the value of an ethical principle, value that courts may invoke as a way of producing support for their decisions. Here the justification is a practical one. Regard less of the origin of the convergence of society on a particular ethical principle, we may come to learn that the principle has socially desirable properties. These properties may serve as part of a pragmatist justification of judicial decisions. Posner offers such an argument in support of "wealth-max imization" as an ethical principle that should form the basis of common law decision making. As evidence in support of the argument that wealth-maximization is a principle upon which there is wide consensus in everyday practice, he offers the prec edents of the existing common law: (Judges] fashion the common law out of customary practices, out of ideas borrowed from statutes and from other legal systems (for example, Roman law), and out of their own conceptions of public policy. The law they created exhibits, according to the economic theory that I am expounding, a remarkable (although</page><page sequence="14">PUBLIC CHOICE AND THE RULE OF LAW 257 not total...) substantive consistency. It is as if the judges wanted to adopt the rules, procedures, and case outcomes that would maximize society's wealth.84 We want to set aside the question of whether Posner's claim that the common law instantiates the wealth-maximization prin ciple is an accurate one. This has been the subject of exhaustive debate. For our purposes the important feature of this argu ment is the role that the evidence of convergence in the evolu tion of the common law might play in a justification of the ethical principle. The key to this kind of justification rests not so much on the fact that judges decided previous cases in a particular way, but rather on the fact that the consequences of those decisions were deemed sufficiently desirable that they were replicated and expanded over time. For Posner, the evi dence of a consensus, or convergence, on a particular principle is evidence that such a principle has shown its instrumental value by the fact that it has withstood the "test of time."35 On this account, principles that have demonstrated over time their utility in the face of competing principles are entitled to some presumption as to their socially desirable character. Here consensus lends support to a judge's justification of her reading of the underlying purposes and goals in a practical way: the goals must be socially valuable or they would not have persisted over time in the face of conflicting principles. This notion, central to the pragmatic program, is an example of the common intuition that a phenomenon that survives an evolu tionary process demonstrates in doing so its functional value. Yet this common intuition is open to challenge; its plausibility depends on the specific conditions under which the historical process takes place. For this to be a good justification of the judge's choice of principles, the conditions that make the test of time a meaningful criterion must be satisfied. We can see more clearly exactly what these conditions are by briefly considering Posner's argument that a pragmatic judge should make an open inquiry into the consequences of her actions in the course of making a decision. The emphasis on open inquiry raises questions about the level of discretion avail able to judges. In response to these questions, Posner must defend this recommendation of a wide-ranging inquiry against</page><page sequence="15">258 Jack Knight and James Johnson the claim that such discretion increases the political dimension and threatens the legitimacy of the law. In fact, he argues just the opposite: "the tools of practical reason can resolve many common law issues with tolerable definiteness, so that the judge does not have to fall back on personal values or raw politics." 36 This argument rests implicitly on the following claim: the re sources that a judge would invoke in the process of reasoning practically about a difficult legal question are sufficiently defi nite and clear that two judges from different political positions would converge on the same answer to that question. Thus, the plausibility of this argument hinges on the nature of the re sources that a judge invokes in the process of practical rea soning. What distinguishes resources that are legally sound from those that are merely political? Here again we see the impor tance of the "test of time" criterion for the pragmatic program. Posner offers an answer to this question in terms of legal prece dent. He acknowledges at first that a precedent is merely an earlier judicial decision. Taken in isolation the decision in diffi cult cases is a political act. Thus, for judicial precedents to be more than mere politics, they have to meet some nonpolitical standard. Posner argues that some precedents meet this stan dard and acquire a more authoritative status over time: One thing that can solidify a precedent—that can make it au thoritative (or more authoritative) rather than just a source of information—is its endorsement by many judges over a substan tial period of time. Other things being equal, a conclusion to which a number of different individuals have come—a conclu sion (better, a hypothesis) that has survived continual retesting— is entitled to more deference than the conclusion of a single individual. So time can help stabilize legal doctrine. Notice that, from this perspective, the more diverse the judiciary, the more its rulings invite unforced agreement, ungrudging deference.37 Thus, the key to legal soundness in this case rests on the survival of certain precedents in the competition of judicial decisions. The fact that a judicial decision has been tested and subse quently embraced by other judges somehow transforms the ini</page><page sequence="16">PUBLIC CHOICE AND THE RULE OF LAW 259 dal political act and provides it with some more authoritative status. Questions of the use of such publicly shared principles are answered with reference to those principles that have survived in an open and unforced competidon of ideas. In Posner's example, the legitimacy of pragmatic judicial decisions depends on the case one can make about the nature of that competition, about the condidons under which certain ideas come to achieve a consensus. If they are not satisfied (and we have suggested a major reason why they would not be in a modern heteroge neous society), we see no reason to distinguish a pragmatist decision from any other political act. Our analysis of Posner's argument shows that the more gen eral claim that courts can enhance the legitimacy of statutes through the use of public values rests on a claim about the underlying nature of the principles that these courts employ. On Posner's account, judges should be constrained by (or, at the very least, should show special deference to) those principles that sadsfy certain criteria. The main criteria are social consen sus and survivability in the test of time. Both rest on the exis tence of free and open inquiry that produces rules and knowl edge that people accept and continue to reaffirm in uncoerced ways. If the rules and principles invoked by pragmatic judges are, in fact, the product of such free inquiry and uncoerced choice, then pragmatic decisions are distinguishable from mere politics. But we must always remember that social convergence on prin ciples and rules does not imply social consensus. The problem for this argument lies in the extreme difficulty in establishing and maintaining the conditions necessary for the kind of free and open inquiry that would give political decisions some non political justification. When these conditions are not established, we see nothing that gives the products of time and convergence any normative significance other than its political one. Thus, unless such conditions are met, neither the use of interpretive conventions nor the invocation of "public" values will ade quately resolve the legitimacy problems raised by a reliance on a public choice theory of legislative politics.</page><page sequence="17">260 Jack Knight and James Johnson IV. The Effects of Interpretive Approaches on the Quality of Legislation Each of these three approaches sees itself as contributing to a basically Madisonian version of democratic deliberation. The court, on this view, can, by adopting one rather than another interpretive posture, enhance or diminish the deliberative pro cesses within the legislative branch.38 Along these lines, these approaches see courts, insofar as judges interpret statutes in a way that creates incentives for behavior that is not narrowly political, as enhancing legislative deliberation and, thus, increas ing the legitimacy of statutes. So these rational choice accounts might turn to the incipient theory of democratic deliberation as a way out of the quandary imposed by public choice theory. But we are doubtful that such a move would be successful. The Madisonian perspective defended by some rational choice accounts takes a mechanical view of democratic deliberation. It sees courts as providing incentives that might ameliorate the propensity of legislators to act strategically.39 This comports with the checks and balances notion of interbranch relations defended by Madison.40 But it is not obviously sufficient to establish that legislative processes generate "legal commands understood as rational requirements imposed by the state for some comprehensible purpose."41 We think that it may be possible to elaborate a notion of democratic deliberation that could meet this last requirement. Such a notion would focus less on the impact of judicial strate gies on deliberative processes within the legislature than on an interbranch process of persuasion and debate. In this sense it is consistent with views of deliberation sketched by advocates of the Constitution in which the courts serve as "an intermediate body between the people and the legislature."42 And it extends notions of deliberation implicit in the writings of some contribu tors to these rational choice accounts.43 Perhaps most importan tly, such a view would evade the apprehensions of rational choice theorists who presume that deliberation derives legiti macy from some relation, however attenuated, to a preexisting popular will.44 Although we cannot elaborate this view here, we would defend a vision of democratic deliberation that derives</page><page sequence="18">PUBLIC CHOICE AND THE RULE OF LAW 261 legitimacy instead from processes of free and reasoned de bate.45 In our view deliberation aims not to induce consensus over values or preferences but, more modestly, to establish agreement over the dimensions of the debate.46 This idealized view of deliberation is consistent with a con ception of how the law actually works in a democratic society. Such a conception must take account of the challenge that both public choice theory and the realities of strategic political behav ior raise for the legitimacy of statutory law. While it resembles views that see the court as engaged in "a continuing colloquy with the political institutions and with society at large," we do not contend that the court "in fact" fulfills this deliberative role.47 Rather, our view is that such an idealized process of reasoned argument both identifies the source from which legal rules derive whatever normative force they may have and pro vides a view of what "democracy requires of courts" that can serve as a critical vantage point from which to assess the short comings of extant legal practices.

The principal-agent literature does not necessarily present an obstacle to viewing courts as agents. Arrow, for example, acknowledges the possibility that an agent might represent multiple principals. See Kenneth Arrow, "The Economics of Agency," in Principals and Agents, ed. J. Pratt and R. Zeckhauser (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Business School Press, 1985). 12. Ferejohn and Weingast, "Limitation of Statutes," 571, 567-68. 13.

McNollgast, 705, 725; Ferejohn and Weingast, "Limitation of Statutes." The purpose of interpretation on this view is not activist in the sense of courts assembling policy preferences. Rather, it springs from the recognition that any contract will have ambiguities that re quire resolution. See McNollgast, 709, n. 11. 16. McNollgast, 707-8, 718-27. 17. McNollgast, 710. 18.

Although Posner casts most of the argument we consider here explicitly in terms of common law cases, the justification of the use of public values in statutory cases follows the same basic logic. In "Pragmatism, Realism, and the Politics of Legal Theory" (unpublished manuscript), we argue that Posner's pragmatic program for statutory interpretation reduces, in the face of his acceptance of the public choice conception of legislative politics, to his program for common law decision making. 31.

Eskridge and Ferejohn characterize this as aspects of a process of selecting equilibrium strategies in a game between the courts and the legislature. They argue that "any satisfactory theory of legislatures must contain a specification of the interpretive regime. Otherwise, legislators wouldn't be able to know what they were voting on, or to form coherent strategies for casting their votes" (268). Thus, they conclude that "interpretive regimes can be seen as 'causing' or 'induc ing' legislative behavior" (273). 39. Ferejohn and Weingast ("Limitation of Statutes" 565, 566, 581) are concerned with the propensity of legislators to pursue reelection at the expense of lawmaking. McNollgast (713, 717, 741) is concerned with the propensity of legislators to introduce language in order to influence subsequent interpretations of legislation. 40.

In particular it would allow us to take seriously the claim made by these theorists that "the composition and prefer ences of these various agents cannot be taken as fixed and immutable" (Ferejohn and Weingast, "Limitation of Statutes," 566).
