Commenting on Abarbanel’s view of Maimonides’ interpretation of the Account  of the Chariot, Eric Lawee notes: “If, as regards Maimonides’ interpretation of the  ‘Account of the Beginning,’ Abarbanel accepted the ‘good’ (most notably what he  generally believed was Maimonides’ literal interpretation of the opening verses of  Genesis 1) and rejected the ‘bad’ (what he deemed Maimonides’ partial annulment  of the contextual sense of Genesis 2-3), things were otherwise in the case of  Maimonides’ interpretation of the ‘Account of the Chariot’: here Abarbanel found  only degrees of bad”; See “‘The Good We Accept and the Bad We Do Not’: Abar- banel’s Stance towards Maimonides,” in Be’erot Yitzhak: Studies in Memory of  Isadore Twersky, ed. Jay M. Harris (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, 2005),  149. For a study of the philosophy of Abarbanel see Seymour Feldman, Philosophy  in a Time of Crisis (London: Routledge Curzon, 2003). For a study of Abarbanel’s  commentary on Maimonides’ Account of the Chariot, see David Ben-Zazon, “The  Commentary of Don Isaac Abarbanel to the Guide of the Perplexed” (PhD thesis,  Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 2009), 201-252 (Heb.).  </page> <page sequence="4"> 210 Chapter Seven The first one captures the essence of Maimonides’ interpretation and  the reason for Abarbanel’s rejection of it: If what Ezekiel apprehended was in accordance with the opinion of  the Master [Maimonides] in the manner he elucidated, then Ezekiel’s  apprehension is similar to what is apprehended by the philosophers  of the natural sciences or metaphysics. It is very strange that rational  investigation should attain what is given by prophetic emanation. If  this were the case, our Sages would not so emphatically command to  conceal this subject. . . . Behold in the academies of the gentile  nations they expound these matters in assemblies of tens of thou- sands, consisting of young and old, making no effort at concealment.  Rabbi Samuel Ibn Tibbon already was aware of this stricture, and  Rabbi Ḥasdai Crescas expanded upon it in his treatise, The Light of  the Lord. Narboni, however, wrote that the Master’s intent is to  show that this is what is apprehended by those engaged in specula- tion. For this reason, Maimonides states in the introduction to the  third part [of the Guide] that the reward of one who conceals the  secrets of the Torah, which are lucid and clear to those engaged in  speculation, is very great. . . . The Master’s contention that they are  “clear to those engaged in speculation” is his own fabrication, for the  Sages made no such assertion.2 Abarbanel’s stricture points to a remarkable development in medieval  Jewish thought. The cream of Jewish esoteric wisdom, the Account of  the Chariot, is identified by Maimonides and his disciples with Aristo- telian philosophy—both metaphysics and the natural sciences, at least  according to Abarbanel’s description. How and why this identification  came about and its implications for the study of the Bible and of  rabbinic midrash—that is to say, for the study of Judaism—encom- passes much of the history of Jewish philosophy. In this chapter, I  would like to touch upon some of the salient points of this story, from  its rabbinic origins to Jewish philosophy in Provence at the end of the  thirteenth century. Early Traditions of the Account of the Chariot The first mishnah of the second chapter of Tractate Ḥagigah reads: 2 See Sefer Moreh Nevukhim [...] ‘im Arba‘ah Perushim (Jerusalem: 1960), part 3, 71b.  All translations in this chapter are my own unless otherwise noted. </page> <page sequence="5"> From Esotericism to Science  211 The [subject of] forbidden relations may not be expounded in the  presence of three, nor the Account of Creation in the presence of  two, nor the [Account of the] Chariot in the presence of one, unless  he is a sage and understands by his own intelligence.3 While the subject matter of the first category, forbidden relations, is  evident, though the reason for the restriction less so,4 and that of the  second, the Account of Creation, is also obvious, as is its esoteric  nature, the subject matter of the third category, the Account of the  Chariot, is in itself a mystery. Clearly a biblical text is involved, as the  term “expound” (dorshin) indicates.5 The Babylonian Talmud elabo- rates upon some of the traditions associated with the Account of the  Chariot, including an identification of the biblical text that stands at  its core: R. Joseph studied the Account of the Chariot. The elders of Pumbe- ditha studied the Account of Creation. They said to him: Master,  teach us the Account of the Chariot. . . . They said to him: We have  already studied therein as far as, And He said to me: Son of man  [Ezekiel 2:1]. He [R. Joseph] replied: This is the very [text of] the  Account of the Chariot. An objection was raised: How far does the  [text of] the Account of the Chariot extend? Rabbi said: As far as  the second And I saw [Ezekiel 1:27]. R. Isaac said: As far as ḥashmal  [ibid.]6—As far as I saw may be taught; from there on only the  3 As translated by Israel Abrahams (with some modifications) in the The Babylonian  Talmud: Seder Mo‘ed (London: Soncino Press, 1938), vol. 4 (Ḥagigah), 59. 4 The talmudic discussion following the mishnah does not bring any mystical tradi- tion associated with this subject, nor do the early commentators. 5 The only biblical text that deals with chariots in a prophetic context is Zechariah  6, but it is hard to discern how this prophecy warrants the severe restrictions placed  on its instruction. Interestingly, there is no explication of any verse from Zechariah  in which a vision of chariots appears in the subsequent talmudic discussion. As we  shall see, this chapter is included among the merkavah texts by some of the medi- eval Jewish philosophers. 6 Ezekiel 1:26-28 reads: [26] And above the firmament that was over their heads was the  likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the  throne was the likeness of a man upon it above. [27] And I saw something like the color  of electrum [ḥashmal], like the appearance of fire round about enclosing it; from what  appeared to be his loins upward; and from what appeared to his loins downward I saw  what appeared to be fire, and there was a brightness round about him. [28] As the  appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of  the brightness round about, this was the appearance of the likeness of the Glory of the  </page> <page sequence="6"> 212 Chapter Seven chapter headings may be transmitted. Some say: As far as I saw the  chapter headings may be transmitted, thenceforward, if he is a sage  able to speculate by himself, yes; if not, no [BT Ḥagigah 13a].7 According to this discussion, the Account of the Chariot is limited to  the first chapter of Ezekiel, though the term “chariot” (merkavah) does  not occur at all in this vision. The chapter itself culminates, beginning  with verse 27, in the most esoteric part of the vision—a description of  the appearance of the one who sits on the throne. While the Talmud  does not explicitly explain the reason for the name merkavah, the  appearance of heavenly creatures termed ofannim (wheels) in Ezekiel’s  vision provides the most evident explanation. Some of the traditions  brought by the Talmud, particularly those associated with R. Joḥanan  ben Zakai and his disciples, point to the esoteric nature of this study,  the supernatural phenomena that accompany its proper explication,  and the heavenly reward thereby attained, that is, a place among the  angels in the world to come. The dangers involved in this study are also  presented.8 The talmudic treatment of the Account of the Chariot includes an  explanation of a number of verses by way of esoteric etymologies: What does ḥashmal mean? Rav Judah said: Living creatures speaking  fire [an abbreviation of תוללממ שא תויח]. In a baraitha it is taught: At  times they are silent (ḥash), at times they speak (mal). When the  utterance goes forth from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be  He, they are silent, and when the utterance does not go forth from  Lord; and when I saw it, I fell upon my face and I heard the voice of one that spoke.  According to the first opinion, only to the end of verse 26, in which the appearance  of a man sitting on the throne is introduced, may be expounded. According to the  second opinion, the meaning of the electrum may also be transmitted. 7 I. Abrahams (with modifications), 76-77. 8 For the dangers involved, see BT Ḥagigah 13a, 77: “For behold there was once a  child [yanuka] who expounded the [mysteries of] ḥashmal, and a fire went forth and  consumed him.” A number of scholarly studies are devoted to a detailed analysis of  the talmudic discussion of the Account of the Chariot in Ḥagigah. See, for example,  David J. Halperin, The Merkabah in Rabbinic Literature (New Haven: American  Oriental Society, 1980); Ira Chernus, Mysticism in Rabbinic Judaism (Berlin: Walter  de Gruyter, 1982). </page> <page sequence="7"> From Esotericism to Science  213 the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, they speak [BT Ḥagigah  13a-b].9 Tales that are mythic in nature are also presented: Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel (ofan) upon the  earth by the living creatures [Ezekiel 1:15]. R. Eliezer said: It refers to  a certain angel who stands on the earth and his head reaches unto the  living creatures. A baraitha teaches: His name is Sandalfon; he is  higher than his fellows by a distance of five hundred years’ journey,  and he stands behind the Chariot and wreathes crowns for his  Maker. But is it so? Behold it is written: Blessed be the Glory of the  lord from His place [Ezekiel 3:12], accordingly, no one knows His  place! He [Sandalfon] pronounces the Name over the crown and it  goes and rests on His head [BT Ḥagigah 13b].10 From the various traditions brought by the Babylonian Talmud, it is  clear that the Sages did not regard the first chapter of Ezekiel as the  only text devoted to this subject. Isaiah’s vision in chapter 6 is  compared to Ezekiel’s more detailed vision. Ezekiel 10:4 is explained  in reference to Ezekiel’s vision in chapter 1. Verses from other biblical  books—in particular, Daniel 7:9-10—are expounded in the course of  the discussion.11 The Babylonian Talmud continues its discussion with the story of  the four sages who entered into an orchard (pardes)—Ben Azzai, Ben  Zoma, Elisha ben Avuya, and Rabbi Akiva—and brings various tales  concerning the protagonists of this story. Rabbi Akiva, the only one  who is said to have entered and departed unscathed by the experience,  is reported as warning his fellow travelers: “When you arrive at the  stones of pure marble, say not: Water water, for it is said: He that speaks  falsehood shall not be established before my eyes [Psalms 101:7]” (BT  Ḥagigah 14b). The context in which this story is brought suggests an  integral connection with the tradition of the Account of the Chariot,  though the story itself is of a different nature. There is no hint in the   9 I. Abrahams, 78. 10 Ibid., 78-79. 11 BT Ḥagigah 13b-14a. </page> <page sequence="8"> 214 Chapter Seven story that he is expounding a text. Rather the story suggests one of  heavenly ascent and the dangers involved.12 Some of the traditions reported in the Babylonian Talmud  concerning the Account of the Chariot appear also in the Tosefta and  in the Jerusalem Talmud with a number of variations.13 From these  various traditions, one can discern at least two major approaches to  the nature of this subject. The dominant one is that the Account of the  Chariot consists of an esoteric explication of a number of biblical texts,  primarily from the beginning of Ezekiel, dealing with the various crea- tures constituting the heavenly world together with the one who sits on  the throne—in all likelihood a figurative reference to God. The proper  understanding of these texts brings about a revelatory experience as  well as reward in the hereafter. The study itself, however, is fraught  with physical dangers for the unprepared, and hence the severe limita- tions placed on those desiring to engage in it. The second approach,  which is described by an entrance or ascent to an orchard (pardes),  suggests a heavenly ascent, in which no text is the object of study.  Rather the mystic is described as beholding different sights on his  journey and warned not to misinterpret their true reality. In this  approach, the dangers involved are emphasized. As we shall see below,  the rabbinic approach in the geonic period, which developed in wake of  the growing popularity of mystical literature, focused more on the  second approach, despite other possible interpretations of the story of  the entrance to an orchard—for example, as a parable for the esoteric  12 For another possibility to interpret the story, see below. For an analysis of this  story, see the studies cited above, n. 8; see also Ephraim Urbach, “The Traditions  about Merkabah Mysticism in the Tanaitic Period,” in Studies in Mysticism and  Religion Presented to Gershom Scholem, ed.

The subsequent midrashic compilations that were edited in the  geonic period, and the mystical literature written at this time or toward  the end of the talmudic period,14 combine and elaborate upon these  approaches. In the Heikhalot (palace) literature, such as Heikhalot  Rabbati and Heikhalot Zutarti, the merkavah (chariot) is conceived as a  palace, and detailed descriptions are brought of the ascent through the  seven palaces of the upper heaven, the dangers encountered by the  mystic, the secret names and seals that are presented to the heavenly  gatekeepers in order to continue one’s ascent, and the awesome and  terrifying sights of God and the angels that are beheld when reaching  the throne room.15 These texts are presented as belonging to the tanaitic  tradition. While some of the motifs found in these texts are derived  from Ezekiel’s vision, there is no attempt to link the heavenly ascent to  the study of this biblical text. Shi‘ur Qomah, a small treatise existing in a number of different  recensions and ascribed to R. Ishmael and R. Akiva, which achieved  canonical status among many Jews in the geonic period, goes so far as  to describe the measurements and secret names of the limbs of God, in  14 Some researchers ascribe an earlier date to these texts, or at least to the traditions  on which they are based—namely, the tanaitic period, if not even earlier. For a  survey of the various approaches to this issue, see Rachel Elior, The Three Temples  (Oxford: Littman Library, 2004), 242 n. 4. I have found no persuasive argument to  date the composition of the texts before the end of the talmudic period, or even  prior to the geonic period, and to treat them accordingly. One, of course, should  not reject out of hand the possibility that these texts contain much older traditions,  as some of the researchers took great pains to show, but in the absence of new  evidence it does not appear to me that it is possible to prove this claim. 15 For an analysis of the texts comprising this tradition, see Ithamar Gruenwald,  Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (Leiden: Brill, 1980), 127-217. For a study of  the relation of these texts to pre-talmudic and to mysticism in the time of the  Talmud, see Gershom Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism and  Talmudic Tradition (New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America,  1960); David J. Halperin, The Faces of the Chariot (Tubingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1988):  Elior, The Three Temples, 241-277; Dan, History of Jewish Mysticism, vol. 2, 678-713. </page> <page sequence="10"> 216 Chapter Seven all probability based on a mystical exegesis of Song of Songs.16 According  to one of the recensions of this text: R. Ishmael said to his disciples: I and R. Akiva pledge that one who  knows this measurement of our Maker and the praise of God is guar- anteed a place in the World to Come, so long as he recites this text  every day.17 By presenting itself as the authoritative teaching of the most esoteric  part of Ezekiel’s vision—namely, of God, Shi‘ur Qomah in a crucial  sense attempts to usurp Ezekiel’s text as well as other biblical texts, as  the main object of study for those seeking to delve into the Account of  the Chariot. The authors of this text, as well as of the Heikhalot texts,  were clearly interested in popularizing their mystical-magical approach,  and no longer severely limiting the study of the Account of the Chariot  to the intellectual elite, which was done in accordance with the decree  of Rabbi Judah the Prince in the Mishnah. They recorded their  approach in texts, thereby making them more readily accessible to the  Jewish community. They ascribed these texts to the leading rabbinic  authorities of old, thereby conferring upon them binding authority,  16 Shi‘ur Qomah takes its inspiration from the descriptions of the lover in Song of  Songs, essentially viewing this book as a parable of the love between God and  Israel. Song of Songs thus may be seen as the most esoteric of biblical texts. Perhaps  this is the reason for the great esteem with which it was held by R. Akiva, who  remarked: “All Scriptures are holy and Song of Songs is the holy of holies” (Mishnah  Yadayim 3:8), even though no mystical traditions related to this text are recorded  in Tractate Ḥagigah. On early rabbinic approaches to Song of Songs, see Saul Lieb- erman’s appendix to Gershon Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 118-126. See also Dan,  History of Jewish Mysticism, vol. 3, 891-898. Song of Songs Rabbah 1:27 brings the  story of the four scholars who entered pardes in the explanation of the verse: The  king has brought me into his chambers (Song of Songs 1:4), which also may help  explain why the merkavah was transformed into the chambers of the highest heav- enly palace. 17 See Peter Schäfer et al.

Many motifs from this  mystical literature found their way into the liturgical poetry and many  Jews were convinced that mystical texts such as Heikhalot Rabbati and  Shi‘ur Qomah in fact belong to the tanaitic tradition. One of the most important pieces of evidence indicative of the  inroads made by this literature is to be found in a question addressed to  R. Sherira Gaon, the head of the Academy of Pumbeditha in the second  half of the tenth century, by the Jewish community of Fez. The commu- nity juxtaposes the severe limitations placed on the study of esoteric  traditions in the second chapter of Tractate Ḥagigah, together with the  warning in the Mishnah that “whoever does not consider the honor of  His maker, it were a mercy if he had not come into the world,” with  the promise made by R. Ishmael and R. Akiva in Shi‘ur Qomah that  everyone who understands this text and recites it every day attains the  World to Come. They ask R. Sherira: Did R. Ishmael state what he learned from his teacher, and his  teacher from his teacher, as a law (halakhah) of Moses from Sinai, or  did he state it as his own opinion? And if this was his own opinion,  did we not learn in the Mishnah: “Whoever does not consider the  honor of his Maker, it were a mercy if he had not come into the  world”? May our Master thoroughly explain this matter to us.19 R. Sherira responds by indicating that Rabbi Ishmael was stating an  authentic tradition, but this tradition should not be understood liter- ally, as God has no limbs or measurements. A true understanding of  these matters, which R. Sherira sees as belonging to the merkavah  tradition, and is in fact the most esoteric part of this tradition, must  remain confined to the elite few as the Mishnah mandates. He thus  18 The opening of Heikhalot Rabbati reads like a recruitment manual, spelling out the  rewards and powers accruing in this world to the one who masters the subject and  successfully completes the mystical journey. 19 See Simcha Emanuel (ed.), Teshuvot ha-Geonim ha-Ḥadashot (Jerusalem: Machon  Ofek, 1995), 217. </page> <page sequence="12"> 218 Chapter Seven excuses himself from delving into these secrets and offering a thor- ough explanation.20 One can detect in R. Sherira’s response an ambivalent attitude  towards the text in question. On one hand, he does not challenge its  authenticity. On the other hand, he seeks to neutralize the tradition it  represents by indicating that it should not be understood literally and  suggesting that the simple recitation of this tradition has no eschatolog- ical significance. A fundamental question raised by R. Sherira’s response is: how  should Shi‘ur Qomah be understood in his view? What were the alter- native approaches to the Account of the Chariot traditions in the geonic  period? It appears that the most important one is that of R. Saadiah  Gaon. In a passage from a lost polemical work of his, preserved by  R. Judah ben Barzilai al-Barceloni in his commentary on the Book of  Creation, R. Saadiah goes so far as to challenge the authenticity of  Shi‘ur Qomah. Even if it is an authentic tanaitic text, he continues, it  clearly is not meant to be a description of God but of a special created  light, known also as God’s Glory (kavod).21 A description of the Glory is brought by R. Saadiah in Book of  Beliefs and Opinions 2.10. After interpreting the corporeal descriptions  of God in the Bible in a figurative manner, R. Saadiah turns to the  problem of understanding the nature of the image of God sitting on the  throne, as reported in a number of biblical passages, including Ezekiel  1:26. He writes: The form was something created. Similarly, the throne and the  firmament, as well as its bearers, were all of them produced for the  first time by the Creator out of fire. . . . It is a form nobler even than  that of the angels, magnificent in character, resplendent with light,  which is called the Glory of the Lord. It is this form too that one of  the prophets described as follows: I beheld till thrones were placed and  one that was ancient of days did sit [Daniel 7:9], and the Sages  20 Ibid., 217-218. 21 Judah al-Barceloni, Perush Sefer Yetsirah, ed. S. J. Halberstam (Berlin: Mekize  Nirdamim, 1885), 20-22. </page> <page sequence="13"> From Esotericism to Science  219 characterized as shekhinah. Sometimes, however, this specially  created being consists of light without the form of a person.22 R. Saadiah’s approach provided a theological alternative to the mysti- cal-anthropomorphic approach of the Heikhalot tradition. The image  sitting on the throne is of a visible creature, the noblest one created by  God, who can take on different shapes or no shape at all, appearing  solely as a special light, in accordance with the divine decree.23 R. Sherira  may have had R. Saadiah’s view in mind when he indicates that Shi‘ur  Qomah should not be understood literally. Unlike R. Saadiah, he does  not go so far as to question the authenticity of this work. It is not clear from R. Saadiah’s account, however, what are the  secrets involved in the study of the Account of the Chariot. R. Saadiah  points to the danger in beholding the face of the Created Glory—it can  lead to the physical decomposition of the person24—but not in studying  traditions regarding this creature or the different heavenly creatures  mentioned in Ezekiel. Nor does his theology suggest that the study of  the heavenly world will lead to witnessing this sight. The Created Glory  is revealed to the one chosen by God to be a prophet in order to confirm  the prophetic mission.25 Aside from reading the first chapter of Ezekiel  in a literal manner while substituting the Glory of God, rather than  God, as the subject of the end of the chapter, R. Saadiah has left us  with no deeper understanding of Ezekiel’s description. No less important than R. Sherira Gaon’s response for showing the  inroads made by the Heikhalot literature in its acceptance by the Jewish  22 Saadiah Gaon, The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, trans. Samuel Rosenblatt (New  Haven: Yale University Press, 1948), 121. For an analysis of R. Saadiah’s concep- tion of the Created Glory, see Alexander Altmann, “Saadya’s Theory of Revelation:  Its Origin and Background,” in Saadya Studies, ed. E. I. J. Rosenthal (Manchester:  University of Manchester Press, 1943), 4-25. See also Howard Kreisel, Prophecy:  The History of an Idea in Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic  Publishers, 2001), 59-91. 23 It should be noted that R. Saadiah also accepts the existence of angels as ethereal  creatures who serve the incorporeal deity and make their way from heaven to earth. 24 Book of Beliefs and Opinions 2.12: 130.

Hai Gaon to questions addressed to him  regarding the interpretation of the story of the four sages who entered  pardes: Know that it has never been our way to conceal anything or to inter- pret it not in accordance with the thought of its author, as others do.  We will interpret for you the view of this tana [sage of the Mishnah],  the matter as he intended and the truth as he held it, without guar- anteeing at present that [acceptance] of these matters is legally  binding (halakhah). . . . Perhaps you are aware that many of the sages  were of the opinion that one who is upright . . . when he wishes to  gaze upon the merkavah and glance at the palaces of the angels on  high, there are several ways to accomplish this: He should fast on  certain known days and place his head between his knees and whisper  to the ground many songs and praises, which have been disclosed.  Then he glimpses its [merkavah’s] innermost parts and chambers as  one who sees with his eyes seven palaces and gazes at them as though  he goes from palace to palace and sees what is in each one. There are  two books of Mishnah that the tanas taught regarding this matter,  and they are called Heikhalot Rabbati and Heikhalot Zutarti. This  matter is well known. Regarding gazing [upon the merkavah], this  tana taught: “Four entered pardes.” He likened these palaces to an  orchard and pictured these four [sages], in accordance with his  opinion, as gazing at the merkavah and viewing the entrance to the  palaces as one who enters an orchard. This interpretation is clear  from the context [of the story]. First, the passage of the mishnah  upon which this teaching is brought is: “. . . Nor [is taught] the  [Account of the] Chariot in the presence of one, unless he is a sage  and understands by his own intelligence.” Furthermore, it is stated  in the baraitha explicity: “R. Akiva said: When you arrive at the  stones of pure marble, say not: Water water.” In Heikhalot Zutarti,  this is explained as follows: “The entrance to the sixth palace appears  as though it contains thousands of myriads of waves of water, yet it  contains not a single drop. Rather it contains luminous air and trans- parent stones of pure marble, like a palace whose luminous appearance  is similar to water.”26 . . . R. Akiva was more perfect than the others,  for he glanced as required and gazed properly and his mind was able  to contain these frightening sights, so God granted him life. Every- thing upon which he gazed he grasped properly with the correct  26 For a slightly different variant of the text, see Rachel Elior (ed.), Heikhalot Zutarti  (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1982), 30. </page> <page sequence="15"> From Esotericism to Science  221 understanding. Know that this interpretation was accepted by all the  earliest [sages] and none of them denied it, since they said that God  performs signs and wonders by means of the righteous just as He  does by means of the prophets, and He shows the righteous wondrous  sights as He does for the prophets. . . . The master R. Samuel Gaon  and others like him, who frequently consulted the books of the  gentiles, maintain that these sights were seen only by the prophets,  and no miracle is performed except for a prophet. They deny all tales  in which it is claimed that a miracle was performed for the righteous  and say that this is not a legally binding opinion. Even the tale  regarding R.

We,  however, are of the opinion that God performs miracles and great  wonders for the righteous, and it is not farfetched that He shows  them inwardly the sights of His palaces and the status of His angels.28 R. Hai neither casts any doubt on the view that the talmudic story of  the four who entered pardes is an allegory for gazing at the merkavah,  nor does he question the authenticity of the Heikholot literature as  tanaitic compositions describing the merkavah and the preparations an  individual must undergo in order to be able to gaze at it. From his  response, one can detect to what extent the Heikhalot literature was  considered the primary one for understanding the Account of the  Chariot in his time. Though he expresses some doubt as to whether one  must accept these views as absolute truth, he himself is clearly convinced  of their veracity.  As for the position of his father-in-law, R.

Samuel, see David Sklare, Samuel ben Hofni Gaon and his  Cultural World (Leiden: Brill, 1996). </page> <page sequence="16"> 222 Chapter Seven this literature by questioning whether the righteous are granted the expe- riences described in it, R. Hai criticizes him for being influenced by  gentile literature—an allusion to the Moslem theologians, the  mutakallimūn, who were of the opinion that God performs miracles only  in order to verify the mission of the prophets.30 R. Samuel follows here in  the footsteps of his predecessor, R. Saadiah, who presented this view in  his Book of Beliefs and Opinions,31 and, as we have already seen, ques- tioned the authenticity of Shi‘ur Qomah. From R. Hai’s response, one  gains the impression that the skeptics were in the minority, and that their  views on this issue were to be rejected, since they were influenced by  non-Jewish sources. We may conclude from what we have seen till now  that the Heikhalot literature, Shi‘ur Qomah, and the Book of Creation  attained and maintained their lofty status among the Jews of the geonic  period.32 Both the Heikhalot tradition and R. Saadiah’s approach were  known to the Jewish thinkers of Spain in the eleventh and twelfth  centuries, but neither of these approaches dominated their thinking.  Many adopted Neoplatonic philosophy in understanding the order of  existence, conjunction with the higher world being the goal of this  study. The stage was set to interpret the Account of the Chariot in  terms of the Greek philosophic tradition, which reached them by way  of Arabic translations of the Greek texts and compositions by Moslem  thinkers influenced by this tradition. Yet in the dominant Jewish phil- osophic treatises of this period—for example, Solomon Ibn Gabirol’s  Fountain of Life and Joseph Ibn Ẓaddik’s The Book of the Microcosm— there is no attempt to explain Ezekiel’s vision. The wedding between  Neoplatonic philosophy and the Account of the Chariot can be detected  in Ibn Gabirol’s poetry, particularly his majestic poem The Royal Crown.  30 See Michael Schwarz’s remark in his Hebrew translation of the Guide of the  Perplexed (Tel-Aviv: Tel-Aviv University Press, 2002), 214 n. 62.  31 See Book of Beliefs and Opinions 3.4. 32 This literature also left its impression on Rashi. See, for example, his commentary  on BT Ḥagigah 14b. For a discussion of the influence of the Heikhalot literature on  Rashi, see Ephraim Kanarfogel, Peering through the Lattices: Mystical, Magical, and  Pietistic Dimensions in the Tosafist Period (Detroit: Wayne State University Press,  2000), 149-151.  </page> <page sequence="17"> From Esotericism to Science  223 At the heart of this poem is a description of the nine principle celestial  spheres, in keeping with Ptolemaic astronomy. Above these spheres is  the “Sphere of Intelligence”: Who shall descend as deep as Thy thoughts?

In the next stanza he  deals with the final level, the Throne of Glory: 33 Israel Davidson (ed.), Selected Religious Poems of Solomon Ibn Gabirol, trans.

Thus far reacheth Intelligence, but cometh here to a standstill, For higher still hast Thou mounted, and ascended Thy mighty  throne, “And no man may go up with Thee.”34 One may interpret the images in Ibn Gabirol’s poem in light of his  philosophical discourse in the Fountain of Life, in which he describes  the supernal simple beings—Universal Soul and the Universal—that  are found above the material world and serve as the source of the indi- vidual forms. These beings are alluded to in the poem in the description  of the “Sphere of Intelligence.” The Throne of Glory signifies the levels  above them—Universal Form and Universal Matter. At the pinnacle of  the hierarchy of being are found the divine Will and the First Being, an  apparent reference to God, the apprehension of which is beyond human  ability.35 Even if one accepts this interpretation, it does not provide us  with a detailed understanding of the components of Ezekiel’s vision in  Ibn Gabirol’s thought. A more explicit understanding of the Account of the Chariot may  be found in Judah Halevi’s philosophic treatise, the Kuzari. He adopts  an ambiguous stance in his understanding of the celestial realm, which  leads him to present three different approaches to the Account of the  Chariot. The first approach follows in the footsteps of R. Saadiah,  who views the Created Glory as the most sublime of God’s creations,  34 Ibid., 102. 35 For a study of Ibn Gabirol’s philosophy, see Jacques Schlanger, La philosophie de  Salomon Ibn Gabirol (Leiden: Brill, 1968). See also Sarah Pessin, Ibn Gabirol’s  Theology of Desire: Matter and Method in Jewish Medieval Neoplatonism (Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 2013). Harry A. Wolfson interprets the Throne of  Glory as a figurative representation of Universal Matter. In support of his interpre- tation he refers to Fountain of Life 5.42, where Universal Matter is described as a  cathedra for the One, and upon which sits the Will. See Harry A.

The second approach appears to be based on  the notion of the pleroma found among the mystics. Halevi writes  (Kuzari 4.3): Concerning the visions seen by Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, there is  some doubt whether their objects were newly created, or of the  number of these lasting spiritual beings. “Glory of God” is that  subtle substance which follows the will of God, assuming any form  God wishes to show to the prophet. This is one view. According to  another view, the Glory of God means the whole of the angels and  spiritual beings, as well as the throne, chariot, firmament, wheels,  spheres, and other imperishable beings. All this is styled “Glory,”  just as a king’s retinue is called his splendor. According to both these interpretations of the Glory, the beings beheld  the prophets were made visible to the prophets’ eyesight. Halevi adds:  “The higher degrees of these beings are so transcendent that even the  prophets cannot perceive them, and if he attempts to perceive them his  body will decompose” (ibid.), a description taken from R. Saadiah’s  discussion of the consequences of seeing the face of the Glory.36 Halevi  understands the Jewish mystical traditions in light of the idea of the  Created Glory that the prophets merit seeing, mentioning explicitly  the Account of the Chariot and Shi‘ur Qomah in this context.37 Halevi considers a third possibility, namely that “some angels . . .  are lasting, and are perhaps those spiritual beings of which the philoso- phers speak” (ibid.)—a clear reference to the Separate Intellects that  are dressed in corporeal forms by the prophet’s imagination.38 36 See above, note 24. Both authors use the same Arabic expression to indicate the  decomposition of the body. 37 See Kuzari 4.3.

In his commentary to Isaiah 6, he indicates that he will explain  the components of this vision in his commentary to Ezekiel, but no  such commentary has survived and it is questionable whether Ibn Ezra  completed one. In several passages in his commentaries, most notably  in his long commentary to Exodus 3:15 and in his commentary to Daniel  10:21, Ibn Ezra equates the angels with those beings who exist as forms  without bodies, a reference to the supernal intellects, and with the  heavenly spheres.40 In Yesod Mora, Ibn Ezra indicates that Ezekiel’s  vision of God as a man sitting on a throne should not be interpreted  literally.41 In a later passage in the treatise, he describes the content and  significance of the highest knowledge attainable by the human being: God alone created all, and knows all the parts in a general way  [לכ ךרדב לכה יקלח עדויו לכה ארוב ודבל 'ה], for all the parts change. Only the  human soul bestowed by God is like a tablet prepared to be written  upon. And when the writing of God is written on this tablet—that  is, knowledge of the principles of what is generated from the four  roots [earth, water, air, and fire], and knowledge of the spheres, the  Throne of Glory, and the secret of the merkavah and knowledge of  the Supernal [or: and the Supernal Intellect, ןוילע תעד]—then the soul  Account of the Chariot, and he also agrees with the view that the Heikhalot litera- ture was written by the Sages of the Mishnah. 39 I do not mean to suggest that Ibn Ezra’s esoteric theological views are derived in  their entirety from Neoplatonic philosophy, whether that of Ibn Gabirol or  Avicenna, and all his vague references should be understood in terms of this philos- ophy. Clearly other sources also underlie his theological views, as evidenced by his  discussion of the divine names in his long commentary to Exodus 3:15 and the  mathematical significance of the letters composing the Tetragrammaton that he  presents there. 40 Both sources present three levels of existents, but they divide the levels differently.  See also his long commentary to Exodus 33:21. For a discussion of these sources see  Howard Kreisel, “The Term Kol in Abraham Ibn Ezra: A Reappraisal,” Revue des  études juives 153 (1994): 39-48. 41 Abraham Ibn Ezra, Yesod Mora ve-Sod Torah, ed.

The  study of the chariot follows the study of the spheres and the Throne of  Glory, suggesting that it refers to the incorporeal world. The mastery of  these sciences leads to conjunction and immortality. As in the case of  Ibn Gabirol, Ibn Ezra gives a poetic expression to this approach. In his  Hebrew adaptation of Avicenna’s Ḥayy Ibn Yaqẓān, Ibn Ezra describes  the nine spheres, followed by the supernal world of the various groups  of angels beyond the spheres, and culminating with God.43 While Ibn  Ezra does not explain these classes, they probably should be under- stood in terms of the Aristotelian view Avicenna adopted of the  Separate Intellects, who are the Movers of the spheres. Ibn Ezra does  not attempt to list ten classes of angels, corresponding to the ten Sepa- rate Intellects (nine Movers of the spheres and the Active Intellect) in  Islamic Aristotelian philosophy, but among those he mentions are  keruvim, serafim, and ofannim—groups of angels found in the account  42 Ibid., chap. 10, 168-169. The term ןוילע תעד occurs a number of times in Ibn Ezra’s  writings, but it does not appear that it is used in a consistent manner. In his  commentary to Genesis 6:2, Exodus 25:6, and Psalms 89:7, the term appears to  refer to astrological/astronomical knowledge. In other passages, such as the short  commentary to Exodus 33:12 and the commentary to Psalms 94:10, it refers to the  Supernal Intellect. In the alternate (long) commentary to Genesis 3:21, it is used in  an ambiguous manner. On the question of whether the Supernal Intellect is a refer- ence to the Deity or to a hypostasis beneath the Deity, see Kreisel, “The Term Kol  in Abraham Ibn Ezra,” 51; see, however, Elliot Wolfson, “God, the Demiurge and  the Intellect: On the Usage of the Word Kol in Abraham Ibn Ezra,” Revue des  études juives 149 (1990): 105. 43 See Israel Levin (ed.), Abraham Ibn Ezra Reader (New York and Tel-Aviv: Israel  Matz Hebrew Classics, 1985), 73-87 (Heb.).

Like  R. Sherira Gaon and Judah Halevi before him, he accepts the authen- ticity of this text but indicates that it should be interpreted in an  allegorical manner.45 The most explicit attempt to understand the Account of the  Chariot in terms of Aristotelian philosophy prior to Maimonides can be  found in Abraham Ibn Daud’s Emunah Ramah.46 Ibn Daud presents  the view that the stars are intelligent beings far superior to human  beings. In showing how Scripture supports this view, he writes the  following: One who studies the beginning of Ezekiel on the Account of the  Chariot and looks at what he says about the four living creatures:  They had the likeness of a man [Ezekiel 1:5], and his further saying:  As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man and they four  had the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an  ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle [Ezekiel 1:10]  . . . and his saying: When those moved they moved; and when those  stood still these stood still; and when those were lifted up from the earth,  the wheels were lifted up along with them, for the spirit of the living  creature was in the wheels [Ezekiel 1:21]—one who looks at all these  things will apprehend subtleties that we shall not explain insofar as  our ancestors prevented us from so doing in their saying: “Whoever  does not consider the honor of his Maker, it is proper that should  not come into the world” (Mishnah Ḥagigah 2:1).47 While Ibn Daud pointedly refrains from entering into any of the details  of Ezekiel’s vision, it is clear from his treatise that it should be under- stood in terms of the nature of the heavenly existents and their influence  on the earthly elements—a topic he describes in detail in light of  44 Abraham Ibn Ezra Reader, 82-83. 45 Yesod Mora, chap. 1, 84; chap. 12, 201. See Alexander Altmann, “Moses Narboni’s  ‘Epistle on Shi‘ur Qoma,’” in Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism (London:  Routledge, 1969), 180-209. 46 For a study of Ibn Daud’s philosophy see T.

Emunah Ramah, however, made little impact on the generations imme- diately following its appearance, as it was quickly eclipsed by  Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed. Maimonides on the Account of the Chariot It was left to Maimonides to develop the connection between the  Account of the Chariot and the Greek philosophic tradition. Given  the legal stature of the author, his treatment carried much weight by  his contemporaries and continued to exert a profound influence on  subsequent Jewish thought. In his commentary on Mishnah Ḥagigah  2.1, Maimonides explains: They [the Sages] understand by the Account of Creation natural  science and an in-depth exploration of the principles of existence. By  the Account of the Chariot, they understand divine science [or: the  science of God, theology], which is an examination of existence in  its entirety; the existence of the Creator and His knowledge and  attributes and that all existents are necessarily derived from Him;  the angels; the soul and intellect of man; and what transpires after  death. Because of the stature of these two sciences—the natural and  the divine—and their superiority, they were forbidden to be taught  in the same manner as the propaedeutic [or mathematical] sciences.49 Maimonides attempts to tread a fine line between maintaining the  esoteric nature of these subjects and at the same time giving an explicit  indication of their content and clear allusions to the philosophic litera- ture that elucidates these matters. The terms “natural” and “divine”  science underscore Maimonides’ approach. Certainly anyone with knowl- edge of the medieval Aristotelian tradition would appreciate his allusions.  48 Ibn Daud deals with the heavenly spheres and their influences on the four elements  in Emunah Ramah 1, 6:32; 2, 4, 2:59. 49 See Joseph Kafiḥ (ed. and Hebrew trans.), Mishnah ‘im Perush ha-Rambam: Seder  Mo‘ed (Jerusalem: Mossad HaRav Kook, 1963), 251. </page> <page sequence="24"> 230 Chapter Seven It is tempting to posit that one of the factors influencing Maimonides’  decision is the desire to halt the influence of Jewish mystical approaches  found in the Heikhalot literature, Shi‘ur Qomah, and the Book of  Creation, which he regarded as completely false and which hindered his  co-religionists from appreciating the philosophic truths underlying  Judaism.50 By and large he ignores these traditions, or one may say,  treats them with silent distain, except for two notable passages in which  he mentions Shi‘ur Qomah explicitly. The first is in his elaboration of  the seventh principle of Judaism, dealing with the unique status of the  prophecy of Moses, presented in the introduction to Pereq Ḥeleq in his  Commentary on the Mishnah. Maimonides indicates that this work  should be interpreted in the same manner as the prophetic visions of  God—a clear indication that they are the product of the Sages’ imagi- nations and should be interpreted allegorically.51 Only in a later epistle  does Maimonides, going much further than even R. Saadiah, reject this  anthropomorphic work out of hand, treating it as the work of “one of  the Greek homilists” (i.e., a non-philosophical pagan work) that should  be completely eradicated. Moreover, he denies having ever considered  this composition one of the works of the Sages.52 For Maimonides there  is only one true key to understanding the secrets embedded in the Bible  and the Talmud regarding the esoteric sciences, and that key is to be  found in the Aristotelian philosophic tradition.53 50 See Menachem Kellner, Maimonides’ Confrontation with Mysticism (Oxford:  Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2006), 1-32. 51 See Isaac Shailat (ed. and Heb. trans), Haqdamot HaRambam la-Mishnah (Jeru- salem: Ma‘aliyot, 1992), 143. 52 See Yehoshua Blau (ed.), Teshuvot ha-Rambam (Jerusalem: Reuben Mass, 1989),  200-201. For a study of this issue, see Raphael Jospe, “Maimonides and Shi‘ur  Qomah,” in Minḥah le-Sarah: Meḥqarim be-Filosofiyah Yehudit ve-Qabalah, ed.  Devora Dimant, Moshe Idel, and Shlomo Rosenberg (Jerusalem: Magnes Press,  1994), 195-209 (Heb.). It should be noted that Maimonides subsequently erased  from his Commentary on the Mishnah the reference to Shi‘ur Qomah; See Shailat,  Haqdamot HaRambam la-Mishnah, 143 n. 27. 53 Maimonides alludes to this view in his discussion of the sixth principle of Judaism;  See Shailat, Haqdamot HaRambam la-Mishnah, 142. In the Guide, he is much more  explicit on this matter: see, for example, Guide 1.68; 2.2. The great esteem with  which Maimonides held Aristotle and his disciples—which can be discerned in all  his compositions even regarding those issues on which he apparently disagreed  with them—testifies to the fact that he did not equate the “Greek homilists” with  </page> <page sequence="25"> From Esotericism to Science  231 Maimonides’ acceptance of the Aristotelian tradition and his desire  to identify this tradition with the Account of Creation and Account of  the Chariot receives its most explicit expression in the first four chap- ters of the first book of the Mishneh Torah, Book of Knowledge, in the  Laws of Principles of the Torah. In the first two chapters, Maimonides  deals with the Account of the Chariot, the subject of these chapters  being God and the “Separate Forms” that exist independent of body—a  clear allusion to the Separate Intellects. He lists ten classes of angels,54  corresponding to the most widely accepted number of such Separate  Intellects in Aristotelian thought, particularly among Alfarabi and his  followers.55 The two highest classes listed by Maimonides are the ḥayyot  and ofannim appearing In Ezekiel’s vision, which refer to the Mover of  the outermost sphere and to the Mover of the sphere of fixed stars  respectively. Maimonides thus appears to give a clearer expression to the  view Ibn Ezra alludes to that the Account of the Chariot is concerned  with the world of incorporeal being. Maimonides outlines the Account  of Creation in the next two chapters, and the subject of this science is  the material existents—the celestial spheres and the sublunar existents.  Maimonides ends his outline of this subject by mentioning the form of  human intellect that attains immortality—“the intellect that is the form  of the soul”—a clear allusion to the “acquired intellect” as depicted by  Alfarabi.56 He concludes his entire presentation by presenting a novel  the Aristotelian philosophers, but rather with those whose were inspired by Greek  mythology. It is important to note that this tradition as it developed in the Arabic  world is permeated by many Neoplatonic ideas, giving it a more mystical bent— particularly the idea of conjunction of the human intellect with the supernal  intellect and the illumination of the intellect experienced in this state. Maimon- ides’ rejection of the earlier Jewish mystical tradition does not reflect a rejection of  mysticism per se, which was very much part of the philosophic tradition in his  period. See Alexander Altmann, “Maimonides’ Attitude toward Jewish Mysti- cism,” in Studies in Jewish Thought, ed.

It is acquired  from the Active Intellect when a person completes his studies, grasps the essence  of the incorporeal existent—namely, of the Active Intellect—and consequently  </page> <page sequence="26"> 232 Chapter Seven interpretation of pardes as it appears in the story of the four sages in  Tractate Ḥagigah. It does not refer to a heavenly ascent, but to the  investigation of the natural and divine sciences. Only one who is intel- lectually capable and fully prepared by completing all the necessary  preliminary studies can emerge intellectually and spiritually unscathed  from an exploration of these sciences.57 Yet only with the mastery of  these sciences does one completely fulfill the highest of religious obli- gations, the love and fear of God.58 The course is now set. Any follower of Maimonides pursuing the  path he laid down would understand that the mastery of the Aristote- lian sciences is far from an act of heresy, as many prior to and after  Maimonides would have it. Rather, this activity is a legal obligation  and the road to human perfection—a view that would soon give impetus  to the translation of Aristotle and his commentators, particularly Aver- roes, into Hebrew in the non-Arabic-speaking Jewish world of Western  Europe, the translation of other philosophic and scientific treatises,  the writing of supercommentaries and encyclopedias of philosophy  and science,59 and the writing of commentaries on the Bible and the  Midrash that are based on philosophical literature in the spirit of  Maimonides’ approach. conjoins with the Active Intellect. For a discussion of this intellect, see Herbert  Davidson, Alfarabi, Avicenna and Averroes on Intellect (Oxford: Oxford University  Press, 1992), 48-70. Maimonides’ description of the perfect human intellect is in  harmony with this view, as he writes there: “And the additional intellect which is  found in the soul of a person is the form of the person of perfect intellect. Regarding  this form, the Torah says: Let us make a man in our image and likeness [Genesis  1:26], that is to say, that he will possess a form that knows and grasps the intellects  that have no body, like the angels that are form without body, till he resembles  them.” Compare this to Maimonides’ description of the prophet in Mishneh Torah,  Laws of Principles of the Torah 7.1; see also Howard Kreisel, Maimonides’ Political  Thought (Albany: SUNY Press, 1999), 137-139. 57 Maimonides, however, makes no allusion to physical dangers.

Is this science completely iden- tical with Aristotelian metaphysics or is there a difference between the  topics with which Aristotle deals in his Metaphysics and those which  Maimonides regards as belonging to the divine science? Moreover, do  the prophetic parables belonging to the Account of the Chariot, after  they are properly deciphered, agree completely with the views of the  Aristotelian philosophers according to Maimonides, or are there signif- icant points of disagreement between them? To these questions there  are no unequivocal answers, as we shall see—a point that would prove  critical for the subsequent interpretation of Maimonides’ thought. Aristotle offers three essential definitions of metaphysics: 1) the  study of that which is eternal and incorporeal; 2) the study of being qua  being (or substance qua substance); 3) the study of the principles under- lying the individual branches of the sciences, such as mathematics and  physics.60 Aristotle’s definition, it should be noted, carries within it the  60 The contents of metaphysics in medieval Jewish philosophic thought, together with  the Greek and Islamic background, have been explored by Harry Wolfson, “The  Classification of Sciences in Medieval Jewish Philosophy,” Hebrew Union College  Jubilee Volume (1925): 263-315.

Isadore Twersky (Cambridge,  MA: Harvard University, 1979), 82-109.

For a treatment of the issue of the scope of metaphysics in Avicenna’s  </page> <page sequence="28"> 234 Chapter Seven seeds of blurring the distinctions between many of the sciences. Aristotle  himself brings extracts from Physics and from other treatises in the  course of his discussion in Metaphysics. The reason for this fact is not  hard to discern. While metaphysics is concerned primarily with incor- poreal existents, corporeal existents also enter into the picture, since  they constitute part of the study of substance per se, in addition to the  fact that a study of the principles underlying their existence and motion  is, for Aristotle, a metaphysical topic. Moreover, insofar as Aristotle’s  proof of God, as well as the other incorporeal Movers, is based on the  motion of the spheres, the study of the spheres is integrally related to  metaphysics. Aristotle himself notes in Metaphysics: That the Movers are substances, then, and that one of these is first  and another second according to the same order as the movements of  the stars, is evident. But in the number of the movements we reach  a problem which must be treated from the standpoint of that one of  the mathematical sciences which is most akin to philosophy—viz. of  astronomy; for this science speculates about substance that is percep- tible but eternal . . . .61 According to Aristotle, there are subjects that are common to meta- physics and the other sciences and in essence belong to more than one  area. As we shall see below, the problem of where to draw the line  between metaphysics and the other sciences becomes all the more  evident in the medieval treatments of this subject, particularly that of  Maimonides. While not all medieval thinkers equated divine science with  Aristotle’s Metaphysics or with the topics included in this work, Aristo- tle’s approach played a dominant role in defining divine science or  theology in medieval philosophy. In his Enumeration on the Sciences,  Alfarabi adopts Aristotle’s view and expands upon it.62 He divides the  natural sciences into eight parts, beginning with the principles common  thought and its philosophic antecedents, see Dmitri Gutas, Avicenna and the Aris- totelian Tradition (Leiden: Brill, 1988), 237-267. 61 Metaphysics 12.8, 1073b, l.1-5 (translated by W.D. Ross). 62 The Hebrew translation by Kalonymos ben Kalonymos was edited by Mauro  Zonta, La “Classificione delle Science” di Al-Farabi nella Tradizione Ebraica (Torino:  Silvio Zamorani Editore, 1992), 23-30. </page> <page sequence="29"> From Esotericism to Science  235 to all natural substances, moving on to an exploration of the heavenly  bodies and the four sublunar elements and culminating in an explora- tion of the human soul and phenomena associated with it. In detailing  each part, he points to the treatises or sections in which Aristotle  treated the subject, beginning with Physics, continuing with On the  Heavens, On Generation and Degeneration, Meteorology, On Minerals,  On Plants, and On Animals, and ending with the treatises On the Soul  and Parva Naturalia.63 The divine science is divided into three topics and  confined to one Aristotelian text, Metaphysics. The topics are as follows:  1) the existents and the accidents accompanying them; 2) the founda- tions of each science; 3) non-corporeal entities, their different ranks, the  First Cause (God), God’s attributes, how the existents came to be from  God, their ranks, their connections with each other, and their perfec- tion. The first topic is equivalent to the study of being qua being.64 Maimonides is aware of Alfarabi’s approach and adopts it, though  in none of his writings does he follow it slavishly. In Commentary on  the Mishnah: Ḥagigah and Mishneh Torah, Laws of Principles of the  Torah, Maimonides offers two different divisions between the natural  sciences and the divine science. In the former treatise, he does not  elaborate on the scope of the natural sciences, but includes a list of  topics belonging to the divine science: a study of being in general; a  study of God, His attributes and His role as the cause of all existents;  a study of the angels, which Maimonides does not identify in this  63 It is strongly doubted that the treatises On Minerals and On Plants were written by  Aristotle. He did write five treatises devoted to living creatures, which were  condensed in the Arabic version to a single treatise, On Animals. Parva Naturalia  consists of a number of his short treatises devoted to dreams, divination, and the  factors that determine the length of life. Ibn Falaquera cites Alfarabi’s list in his  treatise Reshit Ḥokhmah (The Beginning of Wisdom), but then offers a slightly  different division; see Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera, Reshit Ḥokhmah, ed. David Moritz  (Berlin: M. Poppelauer Press, 1902), 50-52.  64 La “Classificione delle Science,” 29-31; cf. Ibn Falaquera, Reshit Hokhmah, 53-55.  Ibn Falaquera posits five divisions of the divine science, essentially subdividing  Alfarabi’s third division into three parts: 1) God; 2) the eternal spiritual existents  (the Separate Intellects) and the secondary spiritual existents (either the Active  Intellect or the souls of the spheres) that are appointed over the heavens and  govern nature; 3) knowledge that the heavenly bodies and those of the lower  world are subservient to these spiritual existents. </page> <page sequence="30"> 236 Chapter Seven context, but elsewhere in his commentary he treats as the Separate  Intellects; and a study of the human soul and immortality. In contrast  to Alfarabi, Maimonides does not mention the principles of the indi- vidual sciences among the topics of the divine science, and he sees the  study of the soul and immortality as belonging to this science, and not  to the natural sciences. In the Mishneh Torah, he distinguishes between  the Account of the Chariot and the Account of Creation on the basis  of the distinction between incorporeal and corporeal existents. The  issue of the nature of substance in general is not mentioned, and more  significantly, the nature of the human soul and its immortality are  included in a discussion of the natural sciences, not the divine science.  In both sources, the topic of the celestial bodies belongs to the Account  of Creation, in the former implicitly and in the latter explicitly. It  should be noted that Maimonides’ division here is reminiscent of,  though not identical to, the distinction between the divine science and  the natural sciences in the Treatise on Logic, irrespective of the problem  of whether he is the author of this work.65 In the fourteenth chapter of  the Treatise on Logic, the divine science is divided into two parts, the  first dealing with the incorporeal existents—God and the Separate  Intellects—and the second with the “remote causes of the subject  matter of the other sciences.”66 The natural sciences, on the other  hand, deal with all existents in nature, ranging from the minerals to  the animals, and their properties.67 In this classification, neither the  study of the human soul nor the spheres is mentioned explicitly. The reason for the ambivalent position occupied by a study of the  human soul is not hard to discern. On one hand, the human soul is  attached to a body, hence its study belongs to the natural sciences.  65 Maimonides’ authorship of this work has been challenged by Herbert Davidson,  “The Authenticity of Works attributed to Maimonides,” in Me’ah She‘arim: Studies  in Medieval Jewish Spiritual Life, ed. Ezra Fleischer et al. (Jerusalem: Magnes Press,  2001), 118-125. See, however, Ahmad Hasnawi, “Réflexions sur la terminologie  logique de Maïmonide et son contexte farabien: Le Guide des perplexes et la Traité  de logique,” in Maïmonide: Philosophe et Savant, ed. Tony Lévy and Roshdi Rashed  (Leuven: Peeters, 2004), 69-73. 66 See Israel Efros (ed. and trans.), Maimonides’ Treatise on Logic (New York: Amer- ican Academy for Jewish Research, 1938), 63. 67 Ibid. </page> <page sequence="31"> From Esotericism to Science  237 Aristotle’s treatise On the Soul was classified by Alfarabi as the culmi- nating work on the natural sciences as we have seen. On the other  hand, the soul has the potential of achieving the state of immortality as  an incorporeal being, hence its study belongs to the divine science.68 At  any rate, Maimonides reverts to a more strict Aristotelian approach in  the Mishneh Torah. Maimonides’ approach in the Guide reiterates his identification of  the Account of Creation and Account of the Chariot with the Aristote- lian sciences,69 and at the same time complicates matters. He includes  in his treatise a commentary, albeit an esoteric one, on the Account of  the Chariot in the book of Ezekiel. Moreover, he indicates in his  introduction to this commentary that it is not based on a received  tradition (Guide 3.introduction: 416): There is the fact that in that which has occurred to me with regard  to these matters I followed conjecture and supposition; no divine  revelation has come to me to teach me that the intention in the  matter in question was such and such, nor did I receive what I  believe in these matters from a teacher. But the texts of the prophetic  books and the dicta of the Sages, together with the speculative prem- ises that I possess, showed me that things are indubitably so. Yet it  is possible that they are different and that something else is intended. The speculative premises are clearly those of Aristotelian philosophy, as  a comparison of his commentary with his discussion on God’s gover- nance of the world at the beginning of part 2 of the Guide makes  evident.70 68 Maimonides’ source for including the study of the soul in the divine science is less  clear. In his encyclopedia, Al-Shifā’, Avicenna deals with the human soul and its  immortality in the section devoted to the natural sciences, but he returns to the  latter topic toward the end of his discussion of the divine science. 69 See Guide 1.introduction: 6, 9; 1.34: 77; 2.2: 253-254. Page numbers refer to Shlomo  Pines’ translation of The Guide of the Perplexed (Chicago: University of Chicago  Press, 1963). All English citations from the Guide in this chapter are taken from  this edition. 70 Maimonides himself notes in Guide 2.2 the relation of these chapters to the natural  and divine sciences. In Guide 2.6: 265, he summarizes his position on this issue:  “There is then nothing in what Aristotle for his part has said about this subject that  is not in agreement with the Law. However, a point on which he disagrees with us  </page> <page sequence="32"> 238 Chapter Seven What is far less clear is the scope of the Account of the Chariot or  the divine science according to his discussion in the Guide. In 1.35:  80-81, he writes: As for the discussion concerning attributes and the way they should  be negated with regard to Him; and as for the meaning of the attri- butes that may be ascribed to Him, as well as the discussion  concerning His creation of that which He created, the character of  His governance of the world, the “how” of His providence with  respect to what is other than He, the notion of His will, His appre- hension, and His knowledge of all that He knows; and likewise as for  the notion of prophecy and the “how” of its various degrees, and the  notion of His names, though they are many, being indicative of  one and the same thing—it should be considered that all these are  obscure matters. In fact, they are truly the mysteries of the Torah  and the secrets constantly mentioned in the books of the prophets  and in the dicta of the Sages, may their memory be blessed. These are  the matters that ought not to be spoken of except in chapter head- ings, as we have mentioned, and only with an individual such as has  been described. While Maimonides does not explicitly equate these topics with the  Account of the Chariot or the divine science, he labels them “mysteries  of the Torah” and applies to them the same limitations that the Sages  placed on the study of the Account of the Chariot.71 Some of the topics  belonging to the divine science that we have seen till now are not  mentioned explicitly, such as a study of being qua being and angels or  Separate Intellects (though the latter topic is subsumed in God’s gover- nance). Instead, other topics are included: creation, divine governance,  divine providence, and prophecy. A number of these topics are  mentioned explicitly in some of Avicenna’s treatises as belonging to the  divine science.72 It should be added that Maimonides’ discussion of  in all this is constituted by his belief that all these things are eternal and that they  proceed necessarily from Him.” 71 See Altmann, “Maimonides on the Intellect and the Scope of Metaphysics,” 110. 72 In his Compendium on the Soul, Avicenna lists the following topics as belonging to  the divine science: proof of the First Cause; the first effect; the universal soul; the  way in which creation occurs; the rank of the intellect with respect to the creator,  the soul to the intellect, matter and forms to the soul, the spheres, stars and gener- ated beings to matter and form, and why there is such a stark divergence in priority  </page> <page sequence="33"> From Esotericism to Science  239 divine governance of the world in Guide 2.2-12 follows directly on the  heels of his proofs for the existence of God, which certainly belongs to  the divine science. The situation becomes even more perplexing when one turns  directly to Maimonides’ commentary on the Account of the Chariot in  the beginning of the third part of the Guide and contrasts it with his  commentary on the Account of Creation found in Guide 2.30. More  specifically, it is significant to see how he treats the study of the heav- enly spheres in light of his earlier approach to the subject. In his  Account of Creation, Maimonides explicitly indicates that ha-shamayim  in the first verse of Genesis refers to heaven and “all that is in heaven,”  a clear reference to the celestial bodies. Later on in his discussion he  cites the midrash that states that God created the heavenly bodies on  the first day and suspended them in the heavens on the fourth.73 He  goes on to indicate, however, that the subsequent appearance of  shamayim, which is equated with the firmament (ha-raqi‘a) in Genesis  1:8, refers to the earth’s atmosphere and that both terms are equivocal.  To prove the equivocality of the term raqi‘a, he cites Genesis 1:17,  which deals with God’s creation on the fourth day: and God set them in  the firmament of heaven. In this context, raqi‘a refers to the heavens,  and the verse comes to indicate that all the planets are located in the  heavenly sphere and there is no void in the heavens. Maimonides  refrains from explaining the meaning of the suspension of the planets  on this day. It appears that he should be interpreted as alluding to  their relation to earthly phenomena,74 and not their literally being  and posteriority among them. See Gutas, Avicenna and the Aristotelian Tradition,  252. This list may be seen as an expansion of that of Alfarabi, mentioned above,  which includes among metaphysical topics the ranks of the existents and their  connections with each other. Gutas notes the differences in Avicenna’s writings  regarding the topics included in the divine science, and ascribes to him an attempt  to expand the list in order to include topics that are central to Islam. See ibid.,  252-261. 73 See BT Ḥagigah 12a. 74 See below. </page> <page sequence="34"> 240 Chapter Seven “suspended” in the heavens on that day. In short, his discussion suggests  that the entire creation story focuses on the earth and its creatures.75 More startling, he sees R. Akiva’s warning to his colleagues not to  cry out “water water,” recorded in the context of the story of the four  who entered pardes in BT Ḥagigah 14b, as pertaining to the nature of  the atmosphere, and points to Aristotle’s Meteorology—at least according  to the medieval and most of the modern translations of the Guide—as  providing the key to understanding this story.76 Toward the end of the  Guide (3.51), Maimonides indicates that Ben Zoma, one of the protag- onists of the story, engaged only in the study of the mathematical  sciences and had not yet reached an understanding of the natural  sciences. He thereby confirms his view that R. Akiva was dealing with  a topic belonging to the natural sciences. Maimonides includes in his  account a discussion of the human soul and human intellection as repre- sented in the story of Adam and Eve and their children.77 The conclusion  to be drawn from Maimonides’ discussion is that the Account of  Creation concerns all existents up to the sphere of the moon, including  the human soul, but not beyond. Maimonides’ commentary on the Account of the Chariot is even  more veiled than the one on the Account of Creation, in keeping with  the nature of its subject matter.78 He writes in introducing his commen- tary (3.introduction: 416): 75 For a detailed analysis of Maimonides’ treatment of the creation story, see Sara  Klein-Braslavy, Maimonides’ Interpretation of the Story of Creation (Jerusalem:  Reuben Mass, 1987) (Heb.). 76 Only Joseph Kafiḥ among the translators of the Guide does not interpret Maimon- ides as referring here to Aristotle’s work. See his edition and Hebrew translation of  the Guide (Jerusalem: Mossad HaRav Kook, 1972), 384 n. 53. For a discussion of  Maimonides’ interpretation of this story, see Klein-Braslavy, Maimonides’ Interpre- tation of the Story of Creation, 160-174. 77 For a detailed analysis of Maimonides’ allegorical treatment of this story, see Sara  Klein-Braslavy, Maimonides’ Interpretation of the Adam Stories in Genesis (Jeru- salem: Reuben Mass, 1986) (Heb.). 78 For a study of Maimonides’ interpretation in the Guide of the Account of the  Chariot, see Shoey Raz, “Metaphysics and the Account of the Chariot: Maimon- ides and Işhaq Ibn Laţīf,” Daat 64-66 (2009): 139-149 (Heb.). </page> <page sequence="35"> From Esotericism to Science  241 I shall interpret to you that which was said by Ezekiel the prophet,  peace be on him, in such a way that anyone who heard that interpre- tation would think that I do not say anything over and beyond what  is indicated by the text, but that it is as if I translated words from  one language to another or summarized the meaning of the external  sense of the speech. Maimonides cautions his astute readers to understand all the chapters  of the treatise, “every chapter in its turn,”79 in order to understand his  interpretation. In his discourse on the Account of the Chariot, he  constantly alludes to views he presents at the beginning of part two of  the Guide dealing with God’s governance of the world through the  mediation of the Separate Intellects and the spheres, thereby estab- lishing a strong connection, if not identity, between these subjects.80  While commentators were hardly of one opinion as to how to interpret  Maimonides’ approach to the Account of the Chariot in the third part  of the Guide, one point emerges clearly—the celestial spheres consti- tute one of the main subjects in Ezekiel’s vision and at least some of  the classes of angels Ezekiel mentions refer to them. This view is remi- niscent of that of Ibn Daud on the subject, as we have seen above.81  Moreover, Maimonides’ comments clearly suggest that the ḥayyot and  ofannim refer to the spheres and the four elements respectively.82 This  approach reflects a sharp break with his earlier stance in the Mishneh  Torah, in which the topic of the spheres belongs to natural science or  the Account of Creation, while the ḥayyot and ofannim described in the  Account of the Chariot in Ezekiel refer to the two highest classes of  Separate Intellects.83 Just as surprising is Maimonides’ explicit claim  79 Compare to what he writes in Guide 1.introduction: 15. 80 See above, note 70. 81 See above, note 47; see also Herbert Davidson, Moses Maimonides: The Man and his  Works (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 350. 82 See Guide 3.2-3. In his discussion, Maimonides also interprets the opinion of Yona- than ben Uziel based on the Aramaic translation of Ezekiel that bears his name.  From his interpretation it is clear that he ascribes to Yonathan ben Uziel the view  that the ḥayyot refer to the Separate Intellects and the ofannim refer to the spheres.  See Guide 3.4. Maimonides, however, does not accept this opinion, as can be  clearly inferred from his discussion. 83 Mishneh Torah, Laws of Principles of the Torah 2.7. </page> <page sequence="36"> 242 Chapter Seven that the image of the man sitting on the throne does not represent  God,84 leaving us to interpret this image as referring to the Mover of  the outermost sphere. Thus the most detailed vision belonging to the  Account of the Chariot leaves out the most important subject of the  divine science—the Deity. As for the content of Ezekiel’s vision,  Maimonides’ exposition suggests that Ezekiel described four primary  celestial spheres containing the planets and stars, an astronomic possi- bility that he defends in Guide 2.9. One should keep in mind that the  dominant astronomic conception, the one Maimonides himself followed  in his Laws of Principles of the Torah, posits eight such spheres, in  keeping with the view that Mercury and Venus were situated between  the Moon and the Sun.85 His discussion leads to the problem of the  veracity of Ezekiel’s vision, or whether the view apparently favored by  Ezekiel should be preferred to the dominant scientific view due to its  prophetic origin.86 84 Guide 3.7: 430. 85 Maimonides reiterates this position in Guide 2.19, though one may argue that he  simply is reiterating the dominant scientific view in this context. More signifi- cantly, he brings the same position again in Guide 3.14, and also sees it as the  position of the Sages. 86 See Guide 2.9-10; cf. Mishneh Torah, Laws of Principles of the Torah 3.1-2. For  a discussion of Maimonides’ positing of four spheres, see Gad Freudenthal,  “Maimonides on the Scope of Metaphysics alias Ma‘aseh Merkavah: The Evolu- tion of his Views.” Freudenthal argues that Maimonides in fact changed his mind  from the time he wrote the Mishneh Torah and came to favor the view of four  spheres which he presents as his own innovation. Freudenthal may be correct in his  interpretation (however, see the previous note), but it should be pointed out that  Maimonides presents this view, which he traces to the “ancients,” as a possibility  that concerns primarily an astronomic issue, not a philosophic one. Maimonides  does not at all retreat from the Aristotelian view of the structure of the world.  Aristotle himself, Maimonides notes, never decided the issue of the number of  spheres, and had posited fifty (Guide 2.4). Moreover, Maimonides seems less  drawn to this view, if he in fact accepted it, because of its apparently prophetic  origin and more because of the symmetry that it introduces into the order of the  world—four sublunar elements, four levels of sublunar existents, four causes for  the motion of the spheres and four spheres affecting the elements (Guide 2.10). In  short, if he favored this view it was primarily for philosophic reasons, despite the  fact that he was well aware that astronomic considerations lend greater weight to  the view that there are eight spheres containing heavenly bodies. The view of four  spheres, however, made very little impact on his followers in Provence, none of  whom, to the best of my knowledge, accepted it outright, and who generally  </page> <page sequence="37"> From Esotericism to Science  243 In his discussion of both the Account of Creation and the Account of  the Chariot, Maimonides cites a number of rabbinic homilies (midrashim),  viewing them as allegorical elaborations upon the allegorical treatment  of these subjects in Scripture. Yet in keeping with his remarks in the  introduction to his treatise, he only hints at their true meaning. For  example, he writes regarding the talmudic etymology of the electrum,  ḥashmal, seen by Ezekiel (Guide 3.7: 429-430): They have explained that the word ḥashmal is composed of two  notions, ḥash and mal; this means, of the notion of rapidity, indi- cated by ḥash, and of that of cutting, indicated by mal, the intention  being to combine through a simile two separate notions regarding  two sides, above and below. They also give a second hint, saying that  the word derives from the notions of speech and silence, saying:  “they sometimes ḥashoth [are silent] and sometimes memalleloth  [speak]” [BT Ḥagigah 13b]. They ascribe the meaning “silence” [to  ḥash] from the verse: heḥesheiti [I have been silent] for a long time  [Isaiah 42:14]; there is thus an allusion to two notions through the  indication of speech without a sound. There is no doubt that their  dictum: “they sometimes ḥashoth [are silent] and sometimes memal- leloth [speak],” refers to a created thing.87 The question immediately arises why Maimonides treats the Account  of the Chariot as well as the Account of Creation in a veiled manner if  the key to understanding them is the Aristotelian view of the structure  alternated between an attempt to interpret Ezekiel in keeping with the dominant  astronomic view or to ascribe to Ezekiel an error. For a discussion of the possibility  of prophetic error, see below. 87 Maimonides’ remarks here are exceptionally vague. The medieval interpreters of  the Guide agreed that according to Maimonides as the color of the ḥashmal refers to  the Separate Intellects, as does the likeness of the man. Though the Separate Intel- lects are incorporeal, they do not possess the same level of unity that characterizes  God but are comprised of two notions. According to Moses Narboni in his commen- tary on the chapter, the upper part of each of the Separate Intellects alludes to the  fact that it is the cause of the Intellect below it in the hierarchy of being, while the  lower part alludes to the fact that it is an effect of the First Cause. In a similar vein,  each one grasps itself as a possible existent, and this is the lower part, and grasps  its Cause as necessitating its existence, and this is the upper part. This is the  meaning of the two interpretations of the division in the word ḥashmal (rapidi- ty-cutting/silence-speech). Compare the commentaries of Shem Tov Ibn Shem Tov,  Efodi, and Asher Crescas to the chapter. </page> <page sequence="38"> 244 Chapter Seven of the world, which he is willing to present quite explicitly in the  Guide.88 If the angels seen by Ezekiel refer to the celestial spheres, the  knowledge of which is quite readily available to anyone engaged in phil- osophic study, why did he not see fit to offer a clear cut exposition of  the subject and append it to the chapters on divine governance in part  two? One may contend that the extent of the correspondence between  the prophetic and philosophic views is precisely the fact that must  remain hidden from the masses. Maimonides is willing to guide his  readers to the view that the prophets are not describing worlds beyond  those conceptualized by the philosophers, but he does not feel that the  time is yet ripe to make the degree of their agreement completely  explicit, to connect all the dots as it were, for the harmful effects it will  have on the average believer.89 His esoteric commentary still leaves  room to interpret the prophets as referring to truths not ascertained by  the philosophers, even if both groups share the same view of the basic  structure of the world. Maimonides’ stature in the field of Jewish law lent great weight to  his theological views in the eyes of the succeeding generations. Those  who adopted his approach were left with a clear cut direction to follow  in trying to understand the Account of Creation and the Account of  the Chariot, namely the study of the Aristotelian corpus, together with  its most important commentators,90 and the dominant astronomic trea- tises. The desired goal is the apprehension of the order of existents, or  of being, culminating in knowledge of God in accordance with human  88 See Davidson, Moses Maimonides, 351. 89 This interpretation complements Narboni’s view as cited by Abarbanel; see above,  note 2. Significantly, Maimonides, in a crucial sense, was more explicit in the reve- lation of these matters in the Laws of Principles of the Torah.

They were also instructed to interpret rabbinic midrash along  philosophic lines. At the same time, they were left to wrestle with many  problems as to the details of these accounts and their subject matter,  which Maimonides had failed to elucidate. Given the parable form in  which Scripture presents these subjects, it is no easy matter to decipher  the true meaning of each of the verses contained in the scriptural  accounts. The same is the case with the rabbinic homilies. Even the  topics that belong to the Account of the Chariot and the ones that  belong to the Account of Creation are not clearly delineated. More  important, Maimonides’ followers were faced with the problem of  determining to what extent the prophets should be seen as Aristotelian  philosophers and the content of their visions, after they are stripped of  the images in which they are presented, should be interpreted as corre- sponding to the philosophic understanding of the natural and divine  sciences. Does not the content of their visions go beyond the knowl- edge possessed by the philosophers?91 Or perhaps the opposite is true,  and through advances in science one now is in a position to discern  what even Ezekiel could not?92 The stakes for the future of Judaism  were immense. Despite the esoteric nature of Maimonides’ commen- tary, it opened up the question of the relevance of the writings of the  prophets, as well as rabbinic literature, for attaining the theoretical  91 Maimonides suggests that this is the case in his discussion of creation (Guide 2.23)  as well as his discussion of prophecy (Guide 2.38). A further hint to this view can  be found in the parable of the lightning flashes that he brings in 1.introduction: 7.  The prophets are depicted as seeing the world in a direct manner when illuminated  by a flash of lightening, while the philosophers see it by way of reflection by means  of a polished stone. For a further discussion of this issue, see below, chapter 8, 278.  92 Maimonides leaves no doubt that while the homilies of the Sages of the Talmud  should be interpreted along philosophic lines, at least those of the greatest of  the Sages, not all of the views reflected in rabbinic midrash are correct. See for  example his stance in Guide 1.introduction: 20, on the reasons for contradictions in  the midrash; cf. 2.8: 267. In the case of the prophets, his explicit statements on  the subject indicate his acceptance of the complete truth of their knowledge, but  we shall see that this may not have been his personal view. Even if the indefatiga- bility of the prophets is his true position on the issue, the problem remains how to  interpret their views. </page> <page sequence="40"> 246 Chapter Seven knowledge by which human perfection is achieved in a far more explicit  manner than any of the writings of his predecessors.93 The Account of the Chariot in Jewish Philosophy in  Provence till the End of the Thirteenth Century The first translator of the Guide, Samuel Ibn Tibbon, wrestled with  some of these problems in his writings, particularly in his treatise  Ma’amar Yiqqavu ha-Mayyim (Treatise of the Gathering of the Waters),  written between the years 1221-1231. Ibn Tibbon views the desire to  inculcate in the masses the belief in the existence of God as the reason  for the Bible concealing certain conceptions which might weaken this  belief, in light of the idolaters’ belief that the stars are the deities.94 Yet  biblical history for him contains increasing allusions to these secret  conceptions, beginning with the writings of David and Solomon, and  continuing in rabbinic times with further elaborations by way of  midrash. According to Ibn Tibbon, Maimonides continues the tendency  of revealing these doctrines, albeit still in an elusive manner, after he  discerned that few were capable of understanding the purport of the  allusions found in the previous literature.95 Ibn Tibbon sees himself as  the next link in this chain, but he, unlike his predecessors, decided to  make these doctrines completely explicit. What has made the task of  revealing esoteric doctrines all the more pressing is the spread of the  sciences among his Christian neighbors: 93 For a discussion of this issue, see my “Esotericism to Exotericism: From Maimon- ides to Gersonides,” in Study and Knowledge in Jewish Thought, ed.

I saw that the  truths that were concealed since [the time of] our prophets and the  Sages of our Torah have become well known among the nations of  the world, and in most places they interpret [Scripture] in accor- dance with the truths concealed in the Torah and in the words of the  prophets and those speaking by means of the holy spirit. Our nation  is ignorant of them completely, and by virtue of this ignorance they  [the gentiles] mock us and abuse us saying that we only possess the  shells of the words of the prophets. . . . I, the youngster who follow him [Maimonides], also saw that  [the number of] those understanding his hints has greatly declined,  all the more so those who understand the hints in Scripture. I saw  also that the true sciences have become much better known among  the nations under whose sovereignty and in whose lands I live— much more than the familiarity with them in the lands of Ishmael.  And I perceived the great need to illuminate the eyes of the intelli- gent by the knowledge and understanding of His words that God  has granted me.96 Like Maimonides, Ibn Tibbon does not claim that he received any  tradition in this area. Rather, it is the study of the Guide and the Aris- totelian corpus, which provides him with the key to understanding the  esoteric doctrines found in the Bible and elaborated upon by the Sages.  He does not present a running commentary on the Account of the  Chariot but devotes a number of chapters to elucidating issues in  Isaiah’s and Ezekiel’s accounts and in Maimonides’ commentary on  these accounts.97 He also sees Jacob’s dream of a heavenly ladder as  belonging to this subject.98 Thus Isaiah and Ezekiel, according to this  view, essentially elaborate upon a subject that is already to be found in  the Torah. 96 Ma’amar Yiqqavu ha-Mayyim, chap. 22, 175. This is the passage to which Abarbanel  alludes in his first stricture; see above, note 2. 97 See Fraenkel, From Maimonides to Samuel Ibn Tibbon, 176-184.  98 See Ma’amar Yiqqavu ha-Mayyim, chap. 11, 54-57. Maimonides deals with this  prophetic parable in Guide 2.10, which touches upon a number of topics that belong  to the Account of the Chariot. For a study of this parable in Maimonides’ thought,  see Sara Klein-Braslavy, “Maimonides’ Interpretations of Jacob’s Dream of the  Ladder,” Bar-Ilan 22-23 (1988): 329-349 (Heb.). For the significance of the motif of  the ladder in medieval Arabic and Jewish thought, see Alexander Altmann, “The  Ladder of Ascension,” in Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism (London:  Routledge, 1969), 41-72. </page> <page sequence="42"> 248 Chapter Seven A number of significant points emerge clearly from Ibn Tibbon’s  discussion, following up on some of the hints Maimonides scattered in  his theological treatise: 1) The study of the celestial spheres—their essence, structure,  and motion—belongs to the Account of the Chariot.99 Astronomy thus  is not only a propaedeutic science, but its principles, at least, constitute  a component of the divine science. 2) Ibn Tibbon sees the ḥayyot in Ezekiel’s vision as referring to  the celestial spheres, and the ofannim to the four sublunar elements.100  Consequently, there is an overlap between the Account of Creation and  the Account of the Chariot. The former focuses on sublunar phenomena  and notes the roles played by the celestial spheres and the Active Intel- lect in bestowing the sublunar forms, though Ibn Tibbon points to the  philosophic controversy, found also among the Sages, concerning the  problem of which existents receive their form from the Active Intel- lect.101 The Account of the Chariot too deals with the Separate Intellects,  the celestial spheres, and the earthly elements, but from the standpoint  of their connection to God and how they serve as intermediaries in the  divine governance of the world. In short, both sciences deal with the  same entities, but from a different perspective. 3) Ibn Tibbon does not address the problem of the extent of the  identity of the views of the prophets and those of the philosophers  directly, but a number of his positions are worthy of note. Like Maimon- ides, he treats many problems regarding astronomy as remaining open.   99 Ma’amar Yiqqavu ha-Mayyim, chaps. 8-10, 28-53. 100 Ibid., chap. 10, 45-48. As we have seen above, this is the most likely interpretation  of Maimonides’ approach. The serafim in Isaiah 6:2, on the other hand, represent  the Separate Intellects in Ibn Tibbon’s view. 101 Ibn Tibbon interprets the controversy between R. Yoḥanan and R. Ḥanina on  what day the angels were created, the former saying the second and the latter the  fifth (Genesis Rabbah 1:3), as relating to the philosophic controversy regarding  which earthly existents require the mediation of the Separate Intellect. Do the  existents possessing a vegetative soul created on the third day require the Separate  Intellect in order to exist, or does the human being, who was created on the sixth  day, alone among the sublunar creatures requires the mediation of the Separate  Intellect to grant the rational soul? See Ma’amar Yiqqavu ha-Mayyim, chap. 4,  12-15; and Robinson, “Maimonides, Samuel Ibn Tibbon, and the Construction of a  Jewish Tradition of Philosophy,” 300-301. </page> <page sequence="43"> From Esotericism to Science  249 He approvingly cites a more recent astronomic theory regarding the  direction of the orbit of the spheres—according to which all nine  spheres move from east to west rather than west to east, with the excep- tion of the outermost sphere—indicating that progress in this area is  still being made.102 On some questions, he favors the accepted philo- sophic view over what appears to be the prophetic view. He hints, for  example, that Maimonides alludes to an error in Ezekiel’s prophecy,  which ascribes sounds to the heavenly bodies.103 The notion that the  spheres produce sounds, Maimonides maintains (Guide 2.8), is in accord  with the view accepted by the Sages, but rejected by Aristotle, that the  spheres are stationary and the planets within them move. Both Maimon- ides and Ibn Tibbon favor Aristotle in this matter. Ibn Tibbon regards  these questions as belonging completely to the area of speculation  rather than tradition (and by implication prophecy), as evidenced by  the fact that the Sages were not convinced that they were correct in  their view of the movement of the planets, and on a different astro- nomic issue even acceded to the view of the gentile scholars.104 As for  102 Ma’amar Yiqqavu ha-Mayyim, chap. 10, 47-48. The reference is to the astronomic  views of Al-Biṭrūjī found in his On the Principles of Astronomy, written in Arabic at  the end of the twelfth century and subsequently translated into Hebrew by Moses  Ibn Tibbon. An English translation of this work was prepared by Bernard R. Gold- stein (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1971). For a discussion of Ibn Tibbon’s  references to Al-Biṭrūjī and for an English translation of the passage in Ma’amar  Yiqqavu ha-Mayyim in which Al-Biṭrūjī’s view is presented, see James T. Robinson,  “The First References in Hebrew to Al-Biṭrūjī’s On the Principles of Astronomy,”  Aleph: Historical Studies in Science and Judaism 3 (2003): 145-163. Maimonides  himself notes the progress made in the area of astronomy in Guide 3.14. 103 Ma’amar Yiqqavu ha-Mayyim, chap. 10, 52. Ibn Tibbon writes in reference to  Ezekiel 3:13: “As to the matter of the sound of the wings—he [Maimonides] already  alluded to it in the second part in a sufficient manner.” For a study of the issue in  medieval Jewish philosophy of the possibility of prophetic error, see Charles  Touati, “Le problème de l’inerrance prophetique dans la théologie juive du  moyen-âge,” Revue de l’histoire des religions 174 (1968): 169-187. 104 Ma’amar Yiqqavu ha-Mayyim, chap. 10, 52. As opposed to Ibn Tibbon, Maimonides  does not explicitly mention Ezekiel in this context; hence it is not clear whether he  was of the opinion that Ezekiel too was mistaken in regard to the motion of the  spheres. He may have understood the verse in a manner that was in harmony with  the accepted scientific opinion. The issue of how Maimonides was to be in inter- preted in regard to the sounds heard by Ezekiel, as well as whether Ezekiel’s view  was to be preferred over the accepted scientific one, was a matter of controversy  </page> <page sequence="44"> 250 Chapter Seven the opinion that Mercury and Venus are above the sun, Ibn Tibbon  points out that Maimonides favors this view, which also appears to  underlie Ezekiel’s vision.105 In this case, however, he does not indicate  explicitly which view he accepts, though his discussion suggests that he  favors the dominant view placing Mercury and Venus below the sun.  While astronomic views provide the key to interpreting Ezekiel’s  vision, the vision itself appears to have no import in determining the  correctness of a certain view in Samuel Ibn Tibbon’s treatment. 4) Ibn Tibbon cannot accept Maimonides’ view that the man on  the throne in Ezekiel’s vision, as opposed to Isaiah’s, does not refer to  God.106 The Deity is the ultimate subject of the divine science. Maimon- ides had argued that since Ezekiel talks of two parts of the figure sitting  on the throne, it cannot be a reference to the one God. Ibn Tibbon  suggests that the figure represents God and the Separate Intellects,  with the upper part referring to God and the lower to the Separate  Intellects, or the upper part to God and the Separate Intellects and  the lower to the Active Intellect. Hence both visions deal with the  same topics—Isaiah providing a more detailed treatment of God and  the Separate Intellects, according to Ibn Tibbon, and Ezekiel focusing  more on the spheres and their governance of the sublunar elements.107 Ibn Tibbon was not the only early Provençal Jewish thinker to deal  with the topic of the Account of the Chariot in the spirit of Maimon- ides. His contemporary, R. David Kimḥi (Radak), who in most of his  commentaries further develops Ibn Ezra’s philological approach, wrote  among later interpreters; see Ofer Elior, “‘The Conclusion whose Demonstration  is Correct is Believed’: Maimonides on the Possibility of Celestial Sounds,  According to Three Medieval Interpreters,” Revue des études juives 172 (2013):  283-303. 105 Ma’amar Yiqqavu ha-Mayyim, chap. 10, 53. 106 Compare Guide 3.7, where Maimonides deals with Ezekiel’s vision, and Guide 2.45  (seventh degree of prophecy), where he indicates that Isaiah saw God in a prophetic  dream. Maimonides maintains that the prophet, however, cannot see God in a  prophetic vision (that is to say, when the prophet receives the prophetic emanation  while awake). 107 Ma’amar Yiqqavu ha-Mayyim, chap. 10, 50-52. </page> <page sequence="45"> From Esotericism to Science  251 an esoteric commentary on the beginning of Ezekiel.108 In a way, his  commentary is more faithful to Maimonides in that it is more esoteric  than that of Ibn Tibbon, though its intent is clear to a reader versed in  philosophy. For Kimḥi too the true intent of the vision is to describe  the world of Separate Intellects and celestial spheres, and to show  God’s governance of the world by way of these intermediaries. What is  absent from his commentary is any allusion to the scientific controver- sies relating to the structure and motion of the celestial world or to the  possibility of prophetic error. In subsequent Jewish philosophical literature in the thirteenth  century, we find further treatments of the scope and content of the  divine science. The most detailed, extant Jewish philosophical account  of the divine science is to be found in Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera’s De‘ot  ha-Filosofim.109 This encyclopedia is devoted solely to the natural and  divine sciences and is based primarily on Averroes’ commentaries on  Aristotle.110 Ibn Falaquera divides the section on the divine science into  108 The esoteric Ezekiel commentary is printed in the back of Miqra’ot Gedolot  editions of Ezekiel. The best edition of this text has recently been published in  Menachem Cohen (ed.), Miqra’ot Gedolot ‘HaKeter’: Ezekiel (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan  University Press, 2004), 329-333. It should be noted that Kimḥi also wrote an  esoteric commentary on the Garden of Eden story, which is found in Louis  Finkelstein (ed.), The Commentary of David Kimḥi on Isaiah (New York: Columbia  University Press, 1926), lii-lxxiv (Heb.). For a study of Kimḥi, see Frank E.  Talmage, David Kimḥi: The Man and the Commentaries (Cambridge, MA: Harvard  University Press, 1975). 109 The section on the divine science survived intact in MS Parma 3156, 234r-292v, and  in part in MS Leiden 4758, 333v-343v. For a discussion of this encyclopedia, see  Steven Harvey, “Shem-Tov Ibn Falaquera’s De‘ot ha-Filosofim: Its Sources and Use  of Sources,” in The Medieval Hebrew Encyclopedias of Science and Philosophy,  211-247. For a discussion of the place of Aristotle’s Metaphysics (or more precisely  Averroes’ commentaries on the Metaphysics) in this encyclopedia, see Mauro Zonta,  “The Place of Aristotelian Metaphysics in the Thirteenth-Century Encyclopedias,”  in The Medieval Hebrew Encyclopedias of Science and Philosophy, 422-425. For a  discussion of Ibn Falaquera and his works, see Raphael Jospe, Torah and Sophia:  The Life and Thought of Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera (Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College  Press, 1988). It should be noted that it is not clear whether Falaquera, who prob- ably was born in Spain, wrote any of his treatises in Provence. 110 Ibn Falaquera also wrote a short compendium of the sciences, Reshit Ḥokhmah,  which is based primarily on Alfarabi’s Enumeration of the Sciences and Avicenna’s  Division of the Theoretical Sciences. For a discussion of this work, see Jospe, Torah  and Sophia, 37-42; see also above, notes 63-64. </page> <page sequence="46"> 252 Chapter Seven three parts. In the first he discusses the Active Intellect; in the second,  the various types of substance and their underlying principles, as well  as the secondary principles—that is, the Movers of the spheres (the  Separate Intellects); and in the third, God as Prime Mover and First  Cause. Among the topics he includes in the last treatise are divine  unity, governance of the world, the order of emanation from God, and  the manner in which all existents are connected to God.111 While Ibn  Falaquera mentions the celestial spheres in the course of his discussion  of emanation, his far more extensive treatment of this subject is in the  last treatise of the section on natural sciences. Significantly, he treats  this subject at the end of his discussion of the human soul. This reflects  a break with the ordinary ordering of the subjects in Aristotelian  thought—the treatise On the Heavens follows on the heels of the  Physics, with the subject of the human soul (including the topics  contained in Parva Naturalia, such as dreams and the longevity of life)  as the final one rounding off the natural sciences.112 The reason for this  change may be Ibn Falaquera’s desire to underscore the fact that the  spheres are the most noble of corporeal beings, more noble even than  human beings.113 Ibn Falaquera’s ordering of subjects in his encyclopedia essentially  reflects Maimonides’ earlier division, one that is also supported by  Alfarabi’s division of the sciences, which sees the main distinction  between the natural and divine sciences as revolving around corporeal  and incorporeal existence. Thus the topic of the spheres belongs to the  natural sciences. In keeping with the Aristotelian tradition, Ibn  Falaquera includes the subject of substance and its underlying princi- ples, as well as the relation between God and the world and the  connection between all its parts as also belonging to the divine science.114  111 For a complete list of the topics of this section, see Jospe, Torah and Sophia, 60-61. 112 Such is the case in Alfarabi’s list of subjects in the Enumeration of the Sciences as  well as Ibn Falaquera’s Reshit Ḥokhmah. 113 See Guide 3.13-14. 114 It should be noted that his short scientific compendium Reshit Ḥokhmah differs  from his encyclopedia on a number of points. Under the influence of Avicenna, he  includes prophecy and human immortality as “branches” of the divine science;  see Reshit Ḥokhmah, 55 and compare with the end of the ninth and beginning of  </page> <page sequence="47"> From Esotericism to Science  253 Unfortunately, he has left us with no commentary on the Account of  the Chariot, which would enable us to see how Ezekiel’s vision is inter- preted in light of his treatment of the divine science.115 A similar distinction between the natural and metaphysical sciences  implicitly characterizes the most popular of the medieval Hebrew ency- clopedias, Gershom ben Solomon’s Sha‘ar ha-Shamayim, written at the  turn of the thirteenth century.116 In this case too the section dealing  with the spheres follows the section dealing with the human soul and  immortality. The most striking feature of this encyclopedia is that it  devotes no section to a discussion of metaphysics, neither to God nor  to the Separate Intellects. Natural science, or the study of corporeal  existents, is the sole subject of Gershom’s treatise.117 The most extensive philosophic treatment of the Account of the  Chariot in the latter part of the thirteenth century belongs to Levi ben  Abraham. Levi completed the long recension of his encyclopedia,  Livyat Ḥen, in 1296.118 He devotes a section to the divine science in the  context of his discussion of the sciences—only a part of this section has  survived—and another section to the Account of the Chariot in the  context of his discussion of Judaism. In short, he is one of the few  the tenth book in the section on the divine science in Avicenna’s Al-Shifā‘  (Michael E. Marmura [ed. and trans.], Avicenna, The Metaphysics of The Healing  [Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 2005], 347-366). In De‘ot ha-Fi- losofim, Ibn Falaquera deals with these subjects in the context of his treatment of  the human soul. 115 In general, extant philosophic commentaries on the Account of the Chariot in the  latter half of the thirteenth century are scarce. It appears that one such commen- tary was written by Moses Ibn Tibbon, but it has not survived. See my introduction  to The Writings of R. Moshe Ibn Tibbon, ed. Howard Kreisel, Colette Sirat, and  Avraham Israel (Beer-Sheva: Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Press, 2010), 30.  Ibn Tibbon deals in passing with Ezekiel 1:26 and some other motifs from Ezekiel  in Sefer Pe’ah; see The Writings of R. Moshe Ibn Tibbon, 186-188. For a study of this  thinker, see above, chapter 4. 116 This encyclopedia has been printed in a number of different editions, the most  popular being Warsaw, 1876. For a study of this encyclopedia, see James T.  Robinson, “Gershom ben Solomon’s Sha‘ar ha-Shamayim: Its Sources and use of  Sources,” in The Medieval Hebrew Encyclopedias of Science and Philosophy, 248-274. 117 One can only hypothesize why he chose not to delve into the cream of the sciences.  He may well have thought that this area should continue to be treated as the  “secrets of the Torah” whose teachings should not be disseminated publicly. 118 For a study of this thinker and his encyclopedia, see above, chapter 5. </page> <page sequence="48"> 254 Chapter Seven philosophers, if not the only one, to deal with the subject in detail from  both a theoretical and an exegetical perspective. It should be noted  that Levi also wrote a poem outlining all the sciences, Batei ha-Nefesh  ve-ha-Leḥashim, which contains these two sections and helps us to  complete, at least in outline form, the missing part of the section  dealing with the divine science in Livyat Ḥen.119 Levi divides his account of the divine science into the following  topics: infinity; space; motion; time; continuous and discreet; potenti- ality and actuality; substance and corporeality; unity and multiplicity;  God as remote efficient, final and formal cause; proof of the existence  of God and His Unity; the order of the Intellects and their activities;  the ranks of the celestial bodies; the order in the world of generation,  and good and evil; the level of the lower world; God’s governance of  the world in its entirety; the existence of multiplicity and unity;  the name of the One and the Existent; negation [of attributes]; the  sublime knowledge.120 As one can see, included in his treatment of the  divine science are not only topics related to God (e.g., divine unity,  negative attributes) and the Separate Intellects, but also the principles  of mathematics and physics (e.g., infinity, place, time, motion), and  more significantly, the order of existents in the celestial and sublunar  worlds and the manner in which God governs these worlds. In short,  the divine science deals not only with incorporeal existents but is the  science that gives us the big picture of all the parts of the world, their  interconnection and their connection with God, as well as the  principles of the other sciences. The natural sciences focus on the  details of the existents in the sublunar world, culminating in a discus- sion of the human soul.121 The two primary sources for his discussion of  119 I have published the section of Livyat Ḥen devoted to the Account of the Chariot,  the surviving part of the section on the divine science, together with the part of the  poem devoted to the Account of the Chariot in Levi ben Avraham, Livyat Ḥen: The  Work of the Chariot, ed. Howard Kreisel (Jerusalem: World Union of Jewish  Studies, 2013) (Heb.). 120 The list of topics is taken from the section on the divine science in Levi’s poem.  The section from the short version of the encyclopedia devoted to the proofs  for the existence of God till the end has survived. 121 Levi’s treatment of the natural sciences in Livyat Ḥen has not survived, but in this  case too we can reconstruct the topics he deals with on the basis of his poem. In  </page> <page sequence="49"> From Esotericism to Science  255 the divine science are Maimonides’ Guide and, more important, Aver- roes’ Epitome of the Metaphysics as translated into Hebrew by Moses  Ibn Tibbon.122 In Levi’s treatment of the Account of the Chariot, he explicates  most of the points noted by Samuel Ibn Tibbon but in more detail, at  times taking issue with Ibn Tibbon’s interpretation. Levi also identifies  additional biblical texts devoted to this subject, such as Zechariah 6— the one vision in which chariots are explicitly mentioned—and the  vision of Elijah’s ascent to heaven in I Kings 19, which deals in his view  with conjunction. He also sees the serafim in Isaiah 6 as representing  the Separate Intellects, with the one in whose hands is the live coal that  touches the prophet’s lips signifying the Active Intellect. As in the case  of his predecessors, he regards the ḥayyot in Ezekiel’s first vision as  referring to the spheres and their motions, though he also brings addi- tional interpretations. In the dispute between Maimonides and Samuel  Ibn Tibbon as to the explanation of the man sitting on the throne, Levi  prefers Maimonides’ view that he does not represent God, and his two  parts represent two levels of Separate Intellects. The different versions of the Account of the Chariot, particularly  Ezekiel’s more detailed visions, focus only in passing on God, a little  more on the Separate Intellects, and primarily on the spheres, their  motions, and their influence on the four sublunar elements. As in the  case of Samuel Ibn Tibbon, Levi is well aware that Ezekiel’s visions  suggest two major issues on which he differs with accepted scientific  opinion—the order of the planets and the view that they emit sounds,  hence they move rather than remain stationary within the sphere. Levi  does not reject the possibility of prophetic error out of hand, but he  prefers to interpret Ezekiel’s visions as corresponding to the accepted  scientific opinion: Batei ha-Nefesh, he does not treat the spheres at all in the section devoted to the  natural sciences. 122 A far more detailed treatment of Levi’s approach to the divine science as well as  the Account of the Chariot can be found in my Hebrew introduction to Livyat Ḥen:  The Work of the Chariot, 53-97. </page> <page sequence="50"> 256 Chapter Seven It appears to us that Ezekiel connected the five planets only insofar  as they participate in a single type of activity.123 The actions and  great changes and disorders that occur in the sublunar world by  virtue of the force [generated] by the motion of the spheres and  planets, he called “din” (ra‘ash). And in this manner we can interpret  the visions of Ezekiel in order not to ascribe to him a false opinion,  as we shall explain.124 In general, his commentary abandons all pretense of esotericism and  discusses the various visions along scientific lines.125 Following Maimonides and Samuel Ibn Tibbon, Levi approaches  rabbinic midrash as expanding allegorically upon the philosophic ideas  contained in the prophetic visions. The rabbinic etymology of ḥashmal  as consisting of two words, ḥash (is silent) and mal (speaks),126 he  explains as follows: Our Sages commented on the matter of the ḥashmal: “At times they  are silent (ḥash) at times they speak (mal). When the utterance goes  forth from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, they are silent  . . .” [BT Ḥagigah 13b]. This means, insofar as each [Separate Intel- lect] receives the emanation from its Cause, it is said to be silent, and  insofar as it emanates its effects [a different Separate Intellect and a  sphere], since its intellect is in actu and apprehends and sees every- thing together in no time, it is said to speak.127  Levi interprets the angel Sandalfon128 as referring to the Active Intel- lect, and writes as follows: “A baraitha teaches: His name is Sandalfon; he is greater than his  fellows by a distance of five hundred years’ journey, and he stands  123 This a reference to the fact that they all act primarily upon the element of air.  124 Livyat Ḥen: The Work of the Chariot, chap. 3, 133-124; see also chap. 4, 147-148. See  however chap. 4, 154, where Levi suggests that perhaps Ezekiel was in error. 125 It should be added that Levi sees predictions of future events as also included in  these visions. 126 See above, note 9. 127 Livyat Ḥen: The Work of the Chariot, chap. 6, 185. Levi anticipates the interpreta- tion brought by later interpreters; see above, note 87. 128 See above, note 10. </page> <page sequence="51"> From Esotericism to Science  257 behind the Chariot and wreathes crowns for his Maker” [BT Ḥagigah  13b]. They said: “stands behind the Chariot,” because he emanates  from the Mover of the sphere of the Moon, which is the last of the  ḥayyot, and he exercises providence and acts vis-à-vis the earth. A  difficulty was raised on this point: “And wreathes crowns for his  Maker. But is it so? Behold it is written: Blessed be the Glory of the  Lord from His place [Ezekiel 3:12], accordingly, no one knows His  place!” that is, He has no special place—for the objector understood  this saying [about God] in a physical sense. Or perhaps he intended  to resolve this ambiguity concerning his words, and he responded:  “He [Sandalfon] pronounces the Name over the crown and it goes  and rests on His head”—that is, he spoke in a non-corporeal sense.  The meaning of this is that the truth of his intellection and compre- hension arranges pleasant and truthful praises for his Maker, and he  conjoins with Him and is perfected through Him, in the manner  that the known conjoins with and is perfected by what is known. Levi further maintains that just as Ezekiel’s visions hint also to astro- logical matters, the rabbinic homilies elaborate upon these matters in a  figurative manner.129 Perhaps the most novel aspect of Levi’s commentary is his summary  description of the kabbalistic doctrine of the ten sefirot above the level  of the angels or Separate Intellects and his critique of this doctrine: Since the Pure Forms are ten, and there is no quantitative or spatial  division between them, it is said: “Ten sefirot that are boundless (beli  mah)” [Book of Creation 1.7]. It is taught that they have no extremi- ties by which they can be joined, but their end is their beginning, as  it is said: “their end is contained in their beginning” [ibid.]. There  are those who interpreted “ten sefirot” ten crowns of praise and  perfection in God, corresponding to His names, which are not sepa- rate in Him, for they all revert to one simple essence. Hence he says  “boundless.” We already spoke of this in the ninth chapter of the  section on faith.130 The kabbalists considered the ten sefirot to be ten degrees  (ma‘alot), one above the other overflowing from it, and they called  129 For example, Levi cites the midrash in BT Yoma 77a based on Ezekiel 9.2, which he  explains in terms of future events that result from the influences of the planets. See  Livyat Ḥen: The Work of the Chariot, chap. 4, 174-175. 130 This section survived only in the shorter version of Levi’s encyclopedia and the  interpretation of this citation from the Book of Creation is not found there. </page> <page sequence="52"> 258 Chapter Seven them “Emanations” (Aẓilot). The first three are spiritual, and are  called: the Sublime Crown (Keter ‘Elyon), Wisdom (Ḥokhmah) and  Understanding (Binah). The first one does not at all resemble any  other thing. And the seven corporeal ones are called: Greatness  (Gedulah), Might (Gevurah), Glory (Tif’eret), Triumph (Neẓaḥ),  Majesty (Hod), Truth (Emet), and Loving-kindness (Ḥesed). Abraham  attained Loving-kindness and Jacob [attained] Truth, as it is stated:  Give truth to Jacob and Loving-kindness to Abraham [Micah 7:20].  The lowest of them is called Land (Ereẓ), and in this manner they  interpret: [God] blessed Abraham in everything (bakol) [Genesis 24:1].  They say that the angels are below all of these, and there emanated  from each sefirah one angel. The lowest sefirah is higher than the first  of the angels. They assent to the view that the angels move the  spheres, each one moves its designated sphere, it being its immediate  cause. Each of these Emanations is divided into two branches, in  accordance with the division into its powers and activities. For this  reason, they attribute to them a right and a left side, and they  mention the Great Hand.131 Moses grasped the sefirah Tif’eret, as it is  said: That caused His glorious hand to go to the right of Moses [Isaiah  63:12]. From some come the strong measure of mercy and from  others the weak; from some the strong measure of judgment, from  others the weak, and from others the intermediate. The human soul  overflows from the third level called Binah, as it is said: The breath of  Shaddai that gives them understanding [Job 32:8], and it is said: And  breathed into his nostrils [Genesis 2:7]. For this reason, Israel is more  dear [to God] than the ministering angels, and can grasp in his life- time [the sefirah] Emet or Ḥesed, and after his separation from matter  he returns to his source, which is [the sefirah] Binah. It is stated in  the Jerusalem Talmud, in [the chapter] “Bameh Madliqin” (With  What Do We Light): “[And the appearance] of the fourth is like an  angel [Daniel 3:25]. He saw the angel put out the fire before them,  and Ḥananya, Misha’el and ‘Azarya did not see him” [PT Shabbat 6,  9, 39b]. The reason for this is due to the fact that they became spir- itual beings and conjoined with God and became greater to an angel. There is no need to expand upon what we ascertained regarding  the superiority of the level of the angels, for we already have done  so. The serafim immediately follow the level of God, as it is written:  Serafim stand above him [Isaiah 6:2], and it is stated: Bless the Lord,  O His angels, mighty creatures who do His bidding [Psalms 103:20].  Furthermore, all their words are based on conjectures and imagin- ings, with no logical proofs. Furthermore, the first one who may be  referred to as Wisdom is God. They maintain that they received  131 See Exodus 14:31. </page> <page sequence="53"> From Esotericism to Science  259 these notions by way of tradition, and they bring proofs from  verses and midrashim and from Sefer HaBahir which is ascribed to  R. Neḥunya ben Haqanah.132 It appears from his account that certain fundamental kabbalistic ideas  had spread beyond kabbalistic circles by Levi’s time, at the end of the  thirteenth century, though we know of no famous kabbalists living in  Provence in his period. The kabbalistic centers moved to Spain much  earlier in the thirteenth century. One also does not find other Jewish  philosophers in Provence reacting against the kabbalists in his period,  or in the following generations, and one must go back in time half a  century to find such a reaction—in Milḥamet Miẓvah by Meir ben  Simeon HaMe‘ili of Narbonne, written between 1239 and 1245.133 It is  not clear from which sources Levi culled his knowledge, which on a  number of significant points differs from the more accepted kabbalistic  views of the time. It appears to reflect a later kabbalistic tradition that  developed in Provence.134 According to Levi’s presentation, this tradi- tion accepts much of the metaphysical worldview of the philosophers  while adding another level of metaphysical reality and ascribing a much  nobler position to the human soul—particularly of the Jews—which is  reminiscent of Neoplatonic thought.135 At any rate, Levi clearly felt  132 Livyat Ḥen: The Work of the Chariot, chap. 6, 189-190. 133 This composition is primarily a polemic against Christianity, but toward the end  HaMe‘ili turns to an attack against the kabbalists; see MS Parma 2749, 228v-235v  (part of this section was published by Gershom Scholem, “A New Document for  the History of the Beginning of the Kabbalah,” in: Sefer Bialik, ed. Jacob Fichman  [Tel Aviv: Omanut, 1934], 148-150 [Heb.]). There is very little in common between  Levi’s criticism and that of HaMe‘ili. It should be noted that the latter regards the  Sefer HaBahir as a heretical work, while Levi regards it as an authentic rabbinic  one, which reflects the change in this book’s fortunes even among the Jewish  philosophers of Provence by the end of the thirteenth century. 134 See most recently Ram Ben-Shalom, “Kabbalistic Circles Active in the South of  France (Provence) in the Thirteenth Century,” Tarbiz 82 (2014): 569-605 (Heb.).  135 For a discussion of the relation between Levi’s presentation and the doctrines and  motifs found in the kabbalistic sources of his period, see my introduction to Livyat  Ḥen: The Work of the Chariot, 93-97. For a contrast between Neoplatonic and Aris- totelian thought on the issue of the level of the human soul, see my “The Place of  Man in the Hierarchy of Existence in the Philosophy of Ibn Gabirol and Maimon- ides,” in Alei Shefer: Studies in the Literature of Jewish Thought, ed.

Levi rejects the kabbalistic approach for presenting fanciful notions  without proof or authentic tradition, there being no level between  God and the Separate Intellects in his view. Nor can human beings  attain a level of knowledge and existence superior to that of the Sepa- rate Intellects. Levi’s presentation and critique reflects his awareness  of the emergence of a new mystical alternative to the philosophic  approach, and he is one of the first to challenge it from a philosophic  perspective. Conclusion In this chapter I have tried to show how the mythical-mystical approach  to prophetic texts as reflected in rabbinic midrash and the Heikhalot  literature is replaced in Jewish philosophical circles by a scientific  approach to the meaning of these texts, with the Aristotelian corpus  and the works the Arabic thinkers who drew from it providing the main  key for their interpretation. It is also a story of a growing exotericism  in the scientific interpretation of the text, due in part to the desire to  meet certain cultural challenges—the acceptance of the authority of the  older Jewish mystical tradition on the part of a wide circle of Jews in  Maimonides’ time while at the same time a sophisticated philosophical  theology had already developed in the Islamic world, or the widespread  knowledge of the sciences and their application to Scripture in Chris- tian circles in Samuel Ibn Tibbon’s time. In Levi’s period a new  challenge arises, the new mysticism that has appropriated much of  Maimonides’ approach but is closer in spirit to the rabbinic midrash and  to the mystical-magical components of the older mysticism. Levi is one  of the earliest philosophers to react against it, though he devotes only a  brief discussion to it in his treatise. In the Maimonidean tradition, the philosophic interpretation of  the Account of the Chariot and the scope of the divine science focuses  </page> <page sequence="55"> From Esotericism to Science  261 on the entire order of existence in order to provide a comprehensive  picture of the world, the understanding of which, in the eyes of the  philosophers, leads to human perfection. The personal eschatological  motive in this study—in this case, the attainment of immortality— plays a dominant role, just as it did in the rabbinic and early mystical  tradition. For many of the Maimonidean philosophers, astronomy becomes  a key component in the divine science, for it provides the basis for  proving the existence of the Separate Intellects and God. In a crucial sense, the acceptance and development of Maimon- ides’ approach can be seen as undermining the authority of the Bible,  as evidenced by the philosophic interpretation of the Account of the  Chariot that I have mentioned, even though Ibn Tibbon, Levi, and  many of the other philosophers maintained their loyalty to Judaism and  attempted to harmonize between the two traditions. For all effective  purposes, science and philosophy supplant religious tradition as the  source of truth. This is not to say that the Aristotelian philosophers  were in complete agreement with each other on all the cardinal issues,  nor is it to deny that at times Jewish philosophers leaned toward those  views that were more easily harmonized with Scripture.136 Overall,  tradition played a secondary role in determining the truth of a given  scientific or philosophic view. How could it be otherwise, when the  authoritative texts of Judaism were seen as presenting truths in an  136 Avicenna, being closer to the Islamic tradition than Averroes, presented many  doctrines that were easier to harmonize with Jewish tradition, whether it be God  as First Cause of the very existence of the world (by way of emanation) and not just  the First Cause of all motion and change, individual immortality, the advantage of  the prophet who attains illumination of the intellect over the philosopher, the  occurrence of many of the miracles (albeit on the basis of a naturalistic explana- tion), and more. Despite the great influence of Averroes on all post-Maimonidean  Jewish philosophy, many of Avicenna’s doctrines continued to be accepted by the  Jewish philosophers of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, particularly in light  of the fact that Maimonides presented many of the same doctrines. For a study of  Avicenna’s reception among Jewish thinkers, see Gad Freudenthal and Mauro  Zonta, “Avicenna among Medieval Jews: The Reception of Avicenna’s Philosoph- ical, Scientific and Medical Writings in Jewish Cultures, East and West,” Arabic  Sciences and Philosophy 22 (2012): 217-287. </page> <page sequence="56"> 262 Chapter Seven esoteric manner, hence open to many different and even conflicting  interpretations? It is easy to see how Maimonides’ approach to understanding  Judaism in light of the philosophic tradition, and moreover, the growing  exotericism displayed by the Jewish philosophers in Provence in  promoting this approach, sets the stage for the conflicts in Provence  and Spain concerning the status of philosophy and its application to  Judaism which erupt in the fourth decade of the thirteenth century and  again at the beginning of the fourteenth.137 The trend among the Maimonideans of interpreting the Account  of the Chariot in terms of Aristotelian philosophy continues throughout  the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. At times this trend is opposed  even by thinkers who appreciate philosophy but reject reducing the  speculative teachings of Judaism to Aristotelian thought, as can be seen  from the attack of Abarbanel.138 This part of the story, however, will  have to wait for a future telling. Appendix: Some Comments on Maimonides’  Esotericism From Samuel Ibn Tibbon till modern times, the esoteric reading of  Maimonides’ philosophy has been based on the premise that the reason  for his esotericism stems from religious-political concerns. That is to  137 A useful survey of these controversies remains: Joseph Sarachek, Faith and Reason:  The Conflict over the Rationalism of Maimonides (New York: Bayard Press, 1935).  138 It should be noted that even among the Jewish philosophers of the thirteenth  century, not all of them were content to equate the divine science with Aristotelian  metaphysics. This point, for example, is evident when examining the early  thirteenth-century encyclopedia by Judah ben Solomon ha-Cohen, Midrash  ha-Ḥokhmah, written in Arabic in his native Spain and later translated by him into  Hebrew when he moved to Italy. While recognizing Aristotle’s Metaphysics as the  basis for the study of divine science and offering a summary of this work based on  Averroes’ Middle Commentary, Judah is interested in showing the difference  between Jewish divine science, based on revelation, and philosophic divine science,  particularly as pertaining to God’s role as creator. In addition to commenting on  various verses and midrashim, Judah also enters into a theosophic discussion of the  Hebrew alphabet. For a discussion of this encyclopedia, see the articles by Resi- anne Fontaine, Y. Tzvi Langermann, and Mauro Zonta in The Medieval Hebrew  Encyclopedias of Science and Philosophy, 191-210, 371-389, 420-422 respectively. </page> <page sequence="57"> From Esotericism to Science  263 say, it was dangerous for Maimonides to reveal to the masses some of  his philosophic views, since these views would undermine their commit- ment to Judaism or condemn their holder as a heretic. Moreover, he  sees the prophets and many of the rabbinic sages as holding the same  views and not revealing these matters explicitly for the same reason,  while at the same time they laid down severe limitations regarding to  whom and how they were to be revealed. Certainly to maintain that  prophecy and providence are completely naturalistic phenomena and  God is neither directly involved in history nor acquainted with any of  the individual’s deeds—assuming that these are Maimonides’ esoteric  views—would lead them to throw off the yoke of Judaism, rather than  continue to be loyal to Judaism as the most conducive social path in the  striving for human perfection, and thus should be adhered to for its  inherent worth. Esotericism was the way for Maimonides to signal his  agreement with the Aristotelian philosophic worldview without under- mining the faith of the masses. In short, it serves as a substitute for  philosophic allegories, as well as Maimonides’ way of guiding the reader  to the explanation of those allegories that he sees in the Bible and in  many of the rabbinic homilies. Only on issues that Maimonides feels he  can publicly proclaim his philosophic doctrine without undermining  the faith of the masses does he do so, most notably, regarding the incor- poreality of God.139 In other cases he explicitly tries to steer his readers  to a position closer to that of the philosophers, such as in his treatments  of divine governance of the world and prophecy, while still leaving  some room for the personal God of tradition. There have been a number of attempts in our own time to maintain  that there is indeed an esoteric level to the Guide, but it should be  understood along different lines. Maimonides himself, it has been  pointed out, in his introduction to the Guide advances another reason  why certain subjects cannot be taught explicitly: Know that whenever one of the perfect wishes to mention, either  orally or in writing, something that he understands of these secrets,  according to the degree of his perfection, he is unable to explain with  139 For a discussion of this issue, see Kreisel, Maimonides’ Political Thought, 189-223. </page> <page sequence="58"> 264 Chapter Seven complete clarity and coherence even the portion that he has appre- hended, as he could do with other sciences whose teaching is  generally recognized. Rather there will befall him when teaching  another that which he had undergone when learning himself. I mean  to say the subject matter will appear, flash, and then be hidden again,  as though this were the nature of this subject matter, be there much  or little of it. For this reason, all the Sages possessing knowledge of  God the Lord, knowers of the truth, when they aimed at teaching  something of this subject matter, spoke of it only in parables and  riddles. (Guide 1.introduction: 8) Maimonides appears to be arguing that language by essence is incapable  of conveying profound metaphysical truths.140 These truths come to an  individual in “flashes” and can be conveyed only in a similar manner,  because discursive descriptions are essentially inadequate to express  them. The ramifications of this view for Maimonides’ philosophy of  language are profound.141 He may well be interpreted as positing a level  of thought that is beyond language, just as God presumably does not  think in words.142 Images in fact may be more conducive to convey the  knowledge that lies beyond discursive thought, but only to the one who  has attained the requisite philosophic background. While I am in agreement with the view that Maimonides accepted  a level of knowledge beyond discursive knowledge, and this is the  level of prophetic illumination,143 I do not see the methodology of  introducing deliberate contradictions and scattered hints as involving  140 See Moshe Halbertal’s discussion of the second approach to Maimonides’  esotericism in Concealment and Revelation: Esotericism in Jewish Thought and Its  Philosophical Implications (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007). 141 For a study of Maimonides’ philosophy of language and its implications for his  philosophy, see Josef Stern, “Maimonides on Language and the Science of  Language,” in Maimonides and the Sciences, ed. Richard S. Cohen and Hillel  Levine (Dordrecht, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2000), 173-226. 142 See Kreisel, Prophecy: The History of an Idea in Medieval Jewish philosophy, 622-625. 143 Thus the parable form may serve the dual function of both transmitting such  knowledge to one with the proper philosophic training and concealing certain  truths from the masses. Furthermore, the emanation to the prophet’s imagination  may have enabled this individual to grasp certain matters that the intellect alone  may have been incapable of grasping. See ibid., 255-257. </page> <page sequence="59"> From Esotericism to Science  265 this type of esotericism.144 Furthermore, the few parables Maimonides  brings in the Guide serve as a pedagogical aid, for he himself goes on  to explain them, including the parable of the lightning flashes. On  most of the issues where he appears to hide his true views, discursive  descriptions are in fact the appropriate means for conveying knowl- edge, whether it be the issue of creation, prophecy, or providence.  The knowledge that cannot be adequately attained or conveyed  involves, in my view, grasping the essence of incorporeal substance.  In the Guide, Maimonides is not attempting to impart this knowl- edge, only the philosophic road to attain it, the issues surrounding it,  and its relation to the texts of Jewish tradition. Another possible reason that has been advanced for Maimonides’  esotericism revolves around his skepticism to attain knowledge in  certain areas. Maimonides’ secret is that he has no final answer to certain  fundamental issues.145 In other words, this approach comes to negate the  view that Maimonides’ esotericism conceals his agreement with the  Aristotelian philosophers on the weighty questions with which he deals.  It posits instead that the secret Maimonides wishes to hide is the fact  that he does not accept any definite conclusions on these profound  issues; at best he can only explore possible alternatives and see to what  conclusions they lead. Maimonides does not want his less astute readers  to discern that neither philosophy nor religion transmit definite conclu- sions that should be held as absolute theoretical truth. In this view,  uncertainty can be even more problematic and unsettling to Maimon- ides’ readers than his upholding the God of Aristotle. 144 Admittedly, Maimonides draws a parallel between his “flashing” truths in profound  matters to his readers and the type of truth that only comes to an individual in  “flashes.” One, however, is hard put to find an example of his doing this in the  Guide. One may interpret him as indicating that a similarity exists between his  presentation and the presentation in parable form of those that attempted to relay  this type of truth in biblical and rabbinic times, not that this is the reason for his  own esoteric writing. One should note that when Maimonides indicates that such  a “flash” occurred to him (see Guide 3.22: 488; cf. 3.51: 624), it involves under- standing how to interpret Scripture on the issue of providence and he presents the  interpretation in a completely explicit manner. 145 See Yair Loberbaum, “On Contradictions, Rationality, Dialectics and Esotericism  in Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed,” Metaphysics 55 (2002): 711-750. </page> <page sequence="60"> 266 Chapter Seven It appears to me that this approach is more reflective of the contem- porary geist than Maimonides’ intent. One major problem with this  approach is that Maimonides gives explicit expression to our inability to  reach demonstrative conclusions on a range of subjects belonging to the  “secrets of the Torah.” He certainly does not hide his stance that we  can only produce dialectical arguments for deciding many metaphysical  questions and even those that belong to the natural sciences, hence our  conclusions must be regarded as tentative.146 Of certain matters, we  have no knowledge at all and can never have such knowledge, such as  positive knowledge of God’s essence; we can only know what God  is not and God’s actions—i.e., the order of nature. With Aristotle,  however, he still agrees that one should favor certain views over  others—namely, those supported by the strongest arguments and  subject to minimal objections.147 This point is most clearly exemplified  by his discussion of creation, even if the apparent conclusion he  reaches is opposed to that of Aristotle. While any conclusion based on  dialectical premises is in principle capable of being negated, this does  not mean that we should not accept it as true, even if a question mark  remains. There are those who have seen Maimonides’ philosophic skepti- cism as more fundamental and extending to the possibility of knowing  anything metaphysical, or even many matters relating to the heavenly  bodies, and this is the view underlying the esoteric level of his writings.  It has been further argued that Maimonides maintains that we have no  demonstrative proof for God’s very existence, and some of the contra- dictions in the Guide revolve around this issue.148 This conclusion  regarding Maimonides’ philosophical skepticism, in turn, is extremely  146 See Guide 1.31; 1.33. 147 Ibid., 2.23. 148 At the end of Guide 2.24, Maimonides writes a very problematic sentence that  may be interpreted as indicating that the existence of God cannot even be  proven by us from the heavens—a view that stands in stark contradiction to his  previous statements on the subject. Most of Aleph 8 (2008) is devoted to an  in-depth investigation of this chapter and its problematic sentence on the part  of many leading Maimonidean scholars, including Herbert Davison, Alfred  Ivry, Josef Stern, Gad Freudenthal, Joel Kraemer, Y. Tzvi Langermann and  Warren Z. Harvey. </page> <page sequence="61"> From Esotericism to Science  267 significant for his theory of human perfection and immortality. If immor- tality, as Alfarabi sees it, followed by Maimonides, can only be attained  with the grasping of the essence of the Active Intellect, and this knowl- edge, or even lower levels of knowledge, is absolutely impossible for  even the perfect individual, then immortality for anyone in any  form is also impossible—a conclusion that Alfarabi himself reached.  The engagement with philosophy may still be seen as providing the  human being with extreme pleasure during his lifetime and is certainly  one of the noblest of human activities, but ultimately it serves as prepa- ration for engaging in political activity in the best possible manner. The  only life we have is this life, and the philosopher’s task is to apply his  understanding to perfecting society. This may be seen as Maimonides’  ultimate esoteric message, and it finds its most important expression at  the very end of the Guide, where Maimonides appears to posit political  perfection as standing above intellectual perfection.149 In short,  according to this view, two levels of esotericism exist in the Guide, one  aimed at hiding the truths from the masses for religious-political  reasons, and one aimed at hiding the truth from the Aristotelian philoso- phers and masses alike, since it undermines belief in immortality shared  by all, the philosophic view that intellectual perfection is the road to  attain it, and thus much of the value of philosophic speculation, which  in fact is very limited in the extent of the knowledge that it can impart  to us once we embark on a study of the heavens and beyond.  This is not the place to analyze the evidence for and against this  view, which has been done by a number of leading scholars.150 In  general, it appears to me to stand in stark opposition to Maimonides’  educational and speculative philosophy as I understand it. Maimon- ides, even in his legal writings, constantly encourages the wise to reach  the stage in which they master the natural and divine sciences to the  149 This essentially is the position taken by Shlomo Pines, with his article “The Limita- tions of Human Knowledge according to Al-Farabi, Ibn Bajja, and Maimonides”  serving as the foundation for upholding this approach. Herbert Davidson directly,  and Alexander Altmann indirectly, sought to negate Pines’s view in this matter, as  well as the consequence that Maimonides rejected any form of immortality. See the  articles cited above, n. 60. See also Kreisel, Maimonides’ Political Thought, 141-148.  150 See the previous two notes. </page> <page sequence="62"> 268 Chapter Seven extent of human capacity, and he consistently ties this knowledge with  human perfection?151 According to the conclusion that Maimonides  embraces philosophical skepticism, this activity may provide an intel- lectually satisfying pastime but appears to contribute little if anything  to one’s perfection and certainly nothing to attaining immortality. At  the same time the study of Aristotelian philosophy poses dangers to  one’s commitment to tradition, a commitment that remains for  Maimonides politically crucial, no matter how you interpret him. More- over, it is Maimonides himself who encourages his readers to study  Aristotelian philosophy, as evidenced by the dedicatory letter accompa- nying the Guide as well as many statements in the Guide itself, while  knowing all too well that this study will inevitably lead to perplexity  regarding religious teachings. As we have seen, the Guide, whose  avowed purpose is to solve the perplexity that confronts one when one  begins to learn Aristotelian philosophy in light of the teachings of  Jewish tradition, proved to be the catalyst for learning philosophy  among its readers in Provence, and I would argue that they accurately  understood its message. Yet why would Maimonides encourage the  wise to engage in such study and become religiously perplexed by  philosophic teachings if the final message is that there is no chance of  ever escaping philosophical perplexity? Is the Maimonides of the Guide  in fact an individual whose final view on all profound issues is one’s  inability to know the truth at all, or at best remain with a question mark  regarding diametrically opposed possibilities with no way of militating  between them? In conclusion, given our own intellectual climate, there is a certain  affinity many modern readers may have for the position that Maimon- ides’ esotericism stems from epistemological considerations rather than  religious (or political) ones. Without denying that Maimonides’ episte- mological views raise a number of profound problems, I see little basis  for the claim that a desire for the concealment of his embrace of  philosophical skepticism underlies them. Given the far disparate inter- pretations of Maimonides’ Guide over the ages, one may be excused for  151 See, for example, his introduction to the Commentary on the Mishnah; Mishneh  Torah, Laws of Principles of the Torah 4.8; Guide 3.27: 51. </page> <page sequence="63"> From Esotericism to Science  269 looking upon it as an open book, with the reader, as the deconstruction- ists would argue, creating the text. Maimonides, in his instruction to the  readers of his treatise in the introduction of his work, is well aware how  differently his treatise will be interpreted by them. Yet he also wants the  astute reader to arrive at the meaning he himself intends, in order “to  liberate that virtuous one from that unto which he has sunk, and I shall  guide him in his perplexity until he becomes perfect and he finds rest.”152  The “rest” to which he refers in my view is not the peace of mind that  philosophical skeptics find in their denial of being able to know reality  truly as it is with the Bible too incapable of providing definitive answers,153  but rather the peace of mind that the Jewish follower of Aristotle finds in  the true knowledge of reality and in his understanding how this knowl- edge stands at the foundation of the biblical text. 152 Guide 1.introduction: 16-17. 153 As opposed to what is termed “fideistic skepticism,” which comes in the service of  upholding religious doctrines due to the limits of reason. </page> </plain_text>
