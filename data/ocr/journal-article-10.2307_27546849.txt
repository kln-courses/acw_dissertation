<plain_text><page sequence="1">MR. HARDY'S MONSTER REFLECTIONS ON THE DYNASTS SAMUEL HYNES THE title of this essay may sound like a quotation?who was it who called The Dynasts a monster??but it isn't one, or wasn't until now. I invented "Mr. Hardy's Monster" because I wanted to introduce the word monster into the cur rent critical vocabulary. You might consider this piece to be my contribution to Monstrosity Theory?of which indeed it may be the only example. Monster is a term with several distinct but related mean ings: something extraordinary or unnatural; an animal or plant deviating in one or more of its parts from the normal type; an imaginary animal compounded of incongruous elements, like a centaur, sphinx, or griffin; an inhumanly wicked or cruel person; anything of vast and unwieldy proportions. In Shake speare's plays Bottom is a monster, but so are Lear's daugh ters, so is the mob of the common people, so is a cuckold; a monster is anything that is off the scale of individual or moral normality. For my critical purposes the simplest definition? anything of vast proportions?is the most useful one: a mon ster in the realm of imaginative creation is a work that is overwhelmingly large. But there is also more than a touch of the other definitions in my use of the term: to eyes trained to customary shapes and sizes, a man-made object created on a huge scale will seem abnormal, excessive, something beyond reason or natural law?an aberration, a prodigy. Victorian England was full of such prodigious creations? on the cultural map of the time one should write, as the old cartographers wrote on the unexplored regions of their maps, "Here be monsters." Monsters of all kinds: architectural, tech nological, literary, artistic, political monsters?huge created things, incongruous mixtures, abnormal shapes. The nine ? 1993 by Samuel Hynes</page><page sequence="2">214 MR. hardy's monster teenth century in England was a large-scale time: the time of the longest English reign, over the largest empire, with the greatest English wealth and power. In that capacious time ex pansion was progress, and progress was expansion: every thing could expand, should expand?the red places on the map of the world, but also poems, dramas, novels, buildings, monuments, bridges, ships. Political ideas, too: in the British Museum Karl Marx was inventing the expansionist theory of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. The forces at work in this great age of expansion have familiar enough names: romanticism; the politics of revolu tion; industrial technology; the new scientific thought. To gether they disturbed inherited ideas of order, correctness, scale, and limitation in many areas of human experience. Searching for a metaphor for this state of things, one is in evitably drawn toward scientific figures. If the old laws and systems and beliefs are seen as centripetal forces, holding creative forces in, then what was happening was that those restraints were weakening, and the opposite, centrifugal forces were explosively expanding. Or you might try a metaphor us ing air-pressure or gravity. But, whatever the figure, the point would be the same: when restraints are released, imagina tions expand. Monstrosity is what you get when creative forces blow out. If this is true, then a lot of Victorian artifacts not usually thought of together can be seen as products of the same centrifugal burst?of the Victorian impulse to overreach the old limits of height and weight and motion, of length and width, to expand the scale of human creation, as the new science was expanding Time and Space. Who knew what the new limits would be? One could only find those limits by pushing against them. Consider some examples. First, from the world of Victorian engineering. Brunei is the great figure here, and his steam ships the great exemplars: the Great Western, launched in the first year of Victoria's reign, huge for its time; followed in five years by the Great Britain, bigger still; followed by</page><page sequence="3">SAMUEL HYNES 215 the monstrous Great Eastern, half again as long as the other two put end-to-end, the biggest ship on any ocean for nearly a half century. Brunei was clearly not thinking of what had worked when he built the Great Eastern, but of what might work?and did. And having built it, he died?of a stroke, a week after the ship's maiden voyage. There's a note of ro mantic melodrama there?the builder as monster-maker, de stroyed by his creation. Other huge examples come readily to mind: the Crystal Palace, the world's largest glass-and-iron building, four times longer than Saint Paul's and twice as wide, a twenty-acre interior crammed with 100,000 objects; the Victoria Tower of the Houses of Parliament, the tallest square tower in the world when it was built, half again as tall as the towers of Westminster Abbey across the road; the Albert Memorial, the most decorated, most gilded, most expensive out-of-door memorial in the world; the railway bridge over the Firth of Tay?the longest bridge yet built. None of these monstrous structures was simply functional, and none was perceived as such by the public. They were wonders, to be admired and celebrated for their immensity. It was in that spirit that the odd Scottish poet William McGonagall celebrated the Tay Bridge. McGonagall has a firm, unenviable place in literary history as one of poetry's inadvertently ridiculous figures?a Stuffed Owl sort of poet? but he is more interesting than that. He was a working man? a weaver in a Dundee mill?with high poetical ambitions: "William McGonagall, Poet and Tragedian" he styled him self. But where was he to find poetry and tragedy in his weaver's world? He turned to the headlines of the daily news papers, to find poetry in public occasions?the Queen's Jubi lee, Lord Roberts's entry into Pretoria?and journalists' trag edy in the day's disasters?the wreck of a steamer, a fire, a flood. It isn't surprising that, when the Tay Bridge was built, McGonagall was there to celebrate it in a poem, "The Rail way Bridge of the Silvery Tay":</page><page sequence="4">216 MR. hardy's monster O Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay! The longest of the present day That has ever crossed o'er a tidal river stream, Most gigantic to be seen, Near by Dundee and the Magdalen Green. Two years later the bridge collapsed during a winter gale, dropping a train and its passengers into the river below. Mc Gonagall wrote another poem, "The Tay Bridge Disaster," economically using the first line of his earlier poem: Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silv'ry Tay! Alas! I am very sorry to say That ninety lives have been taken away On the last Sabbath day of 1879, Which will be remembered for a very long time. Ridiculous? Yes, I suppose so; but interesting, too. A late Victorian would-be poet, too late and too urban for romanti cism, finding beauty in a bridge, grandeur in its hugeness, and tragedy in its fall?celebrating and commemorating a Victorian monster. Contemporary accounts of these monstrous Victorian struc tures are full of superlatives like McGonagall's?the tallest, the longest, the highest, the most capacious, the most expen sive?words that imply value quite apart from function, even, in the case of the Albert Memorial, moral value. This notion, that bigger is better, that spatial extension expands the human spirit, is very much a Victorian principle. It comes from the heart of Victorian achievement, from its triumphalist technology. And what about Victorian literature? Where are the mon sters there? One might look, for a start, at two huge poems that stand at the beginning and end of Victoria's reign, like giant warders set to guard it. At the beginning Philip James Bailey's Festus, which first appeared in 1839 in a version 10,000 lines long, and went on monstrously growing until, fifty years later, it had reached 40,000 lines?the equivalent</page><page sequence="5">SAMUEL HYNES 217 (at least in length) of four Paradise Losts. And at the other end of the reign, Charles Doughty's Daum in Britain (1906), an epic poem in six volumes, 450 years of ancient history in cluding the taking of Rome by the Gauls and the destruc tion of Jerusalem by Titus, 30,000 lines?though it seems longer?monstrous in scale and monstrous in language. Between these sentinels, some monstrous novels. That they are monstrous we have the word of Henry James, who looked back from the early twentieth century at the novels of the nineteenth, and was appalled by their artistic inadequacies. "A picture without composition [James wrote in his preface to The Tragic Muse] slights its most precious chance for beauty, and is moreover not composed at all unless the painter knows how that principle of health and safety, work ing as an absolutely premeditated art, has prevailed. There may in its absence be life, incontestably, as 'The Newcomes' has life, as 'Les Trois Mousquetaires,' as Tolstoi's 'Peace and War,' have it; but what do such large loose baggy monsters, with their queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary, artistically meanY' James called these novels monsters for the same reasons that led me to apply that term to the Crystal Palace and the Albert Memorial: because they exceeded the limits of their form, were too big, too cluttered, too full of things happening; because they contained too much life. Like the buildings they manifested that powerful nineteenth century urge to expand and extend, to ingest the world. That urge was the opposite of James's fastidious control; of course he despised the novels that expressed it. My intention should by now be clear enough: I have been constructing a critical category?monstrosity?in order to place Hardy's Dynasts in it. I invite you to consider The Dynasts in the contexts of these other Victorian artifacts, as a late example of the nineteenth century's preoccupation with hugeness, with some of the other meanings of the term?in congruity, excess, abnormality?also hovering round. That Hardy's work belongs in that extravagant company is clear from the book's title page alone: "The Dynasts, an epic drama of the war with Napoleon, in three parts, nineteen</page><page sequence="6">218 MR. hardy's monster acts, and one hundred and thirty scenes." (Actually Hardy miscounted: there are 131 scenes.) Here is a drama roughly the same length as all four of Shakespeare's Lancastrian his tory plays put together, a play as long as Paradise Lost, dra matic in form but epic in scope, written in a mixture of lyric verse, blank verse, and prose, too long to be acted and too big for a closet. Hardy described it, with evident satisfaction, as "the longest English drama in existence." A hybrid monster, surely. That he didn't quite know what to call it isn't surprising. The first editions of the three separate parts are all subtitled simply "A Drama"?an inadvertency that caused Hardy some discomfort. When Part First was published in 1904 the Times drama critic, A. B. Walkley, saw that subtitle, claimed the book for his department, and reviewed it as a play. His com ments, which ran in two issues of the Times Literary Sup plement, are a jocular essay on monstrosity. The Dynasts, he said, was "a fearful sort of wildfowl," a work that looked like a play, but contained "whole fleets and armies, Houses of Commons, vast cathedral congregations, and thronged streets" beyond the capacities of any ordinary theater. He concluded that it could be done, but only as a marionette play; it was, he said, "Aeschylus for puppets." Hardy was deeply offended by Walkley's half-mocking suggestion; but in fact Walkley had simply taken up a meta phor from the Fore Scene of Part First. "Tis not in me," the Spirit of the Years says to feel with, or against, These flesh-hinged mannikins Its hand upwinds To click-clack off Its preadjusted laws. And later in the same scene: Behoves it us to enter scene by scene, And watch the spectacle of Europe's moves In her embroil, as they were self-ordained According to the naive and liberal creed</page><page sequence="7">SAMUEL HYNES 219 Of our great-hearted young Compassionates, Forgetting the Prime Mover of the gear, As puppet-watchers him who pulls the strings_ But, though Hardy fancied the metaphor, he didn't like the proposed application of it, which would reduce the scale of his imagined universe to a curtained box at a fair. Replying to Walkley in the TLS, he abandoned "drama" as a descriptive term for his work, and offered first "panoramic poem" and then "spectacular poem . . . more or less resembling a stage play, though not one." But Walkley had made his point: if The Dynasts was a drama, it was a monstrously contradictory one, a huge space full of tiny figures. Walkley saw, acutely, that it wasn't simply the size of the work that made it mon strous, but its double scale, at once too large and too small. Five years later, when the whole work had been completed and published, Hardy was still worrying about the subtitle. He wrote to his friend Henry Newbolt in 1909: I want to put on the titlepage of a new edition of The Dynasts something more explicit than the words "A Drama", which mislead the public into thinking it is not for reading. I have thought of A mental drama A vision-drama A closet-drama An epical drama, &amp;c or "A chronicle poem of the Nape wars, under the simili tude of a drama", but I cannot decide. Hardy's list of possible subtitles is worth pausing over, for the clues it offers to what he thought?or hoped?he had created. Three of them focus on the subjective, nonrepresen tational aspect of the work: it is a mental drama (you think it), or a vision-drama (you imagine it), or a closet-drama (you read it). But the other two possibilities?epical drama and chronicle poem?point in the opposite direction, out ward, to the physical scale and historical importance of the</page><page sequence="8">220 MR. hardy's monster events represented. The two sets of subtitles seem to contra dict each other: is it a modern, inner drama, or a traditional, outer one? That contradiction remained, whatever subtitle Hardy finally chose; it is still there as we read it now. In the end Hardy called The Dynasts an epic-drama, thus claiming for it a connection with the classical past. But, at the same time when he claimed that link, he was thinking that no such link could exist: the past was dead, and its myths were useless to the modern poet. "The old theologies may or may not have worked for good in their time," he wrote in his note book while he was writing The Dynasts. "But they will not bear stretching further in epic or dramatic art. The Greeks used up theirs: the Jews used up theirs: the Christians have used up theirs. So that one must make an independent plunge, embodying the real, if only temporary, thought of the age." When Hardy wrote of the "thought of the age" he wasn't being casual: the Dynasts years were for him a time of serious philosophical study. His letters of the time are full of philos ophers' names?Spencer, Schopenhauer, von Hartman, and others now forgotten?and his notebooks include a long sec tion headed "Notes in Philosophy." This was the time, too, of many of his philosophical poems: "Doom and She," "The Subalterns," "God-Forgotten," "New Year's Eve," "God's Education." Hardy was trying to make himself into a phi losopher at the same time that he was trying to write a mod ern philosophical epic-drama. Having written it, it was the philosophy of the work that he defended. He was quick to admit stylistic deficiencies, and was modestly apologetic about them; but there were no apologies for the philosophy: it was right, "a generalized form of what the thinking world had gradually come to adopt, myself included." One can see Hardy groping his way toward that philos ophy, and the poetic expression of it, in notes made twenty years before he wrote The Dynasts, long before he had set tled on either the exact subject or the epic-drama form. February 16, 1882: Write a history of human automa tism, or impulsion. . . .</page><page sequence="9">SAMUEL HYNES 221 March 4, 1886: The human race to be shown as one great network or tissue which quivers in every part when one point is shaken, like a spider's web if touched. Ab stract realisms to be in the form of Spirits, Spectral Figures, etc. In the human world, automatons; in the universe beyond men, abstractions. It doesn't sound like a formula for either an epic or a drama, but Hardy built his work on those fundamental principles: his universe would be the emptied infinity that Victorian scientists had conceived; in it men would be minis cule creatures, insects that willed themselves wills, but had none. What would be the appropriate form in which to enact so cold and determined a philosophy? It would require Ab stractions, corresponding to the supernatural figures of the old theologies but without the anthropomorphic identities of the old gods, and without their involvement in human desti nies. There would have to be vast space, with nothing in it but those notional phantoms, and on earth great historical actions, extended in space and time?epic actions. And for the telling, a tone that was relentlessly ironic, because the universe was: human beings self-deluded, thinking their ac tions free; the abstract spirits knowing they were not, but in different to their fates. Hardy chose at last a form that was a huge hybrid of epic and drama, and a story that was the grandest in English his tory of the previous century?England's wars with Napoleon, from Trafalgar to Waterloo. He populated his play with kings and queens, generals and statesmen, and with vast armies and navies, and he placed above them Phantom Intelligences, to which he gave abstract names: The Ancient Spirit of the Years, The Spirit of the Pities, Spirits Sinister and Ironic, The Spirit of Rumour. And above them, unseen and unspeaking, too abstract and unknowing even to pare Its fingernails, he set his indifferent Prime Mover, the Immanent Will. For earthly scenes he turned to standard histories, to Han sard, to War and Peace, and to the participants' own memoirs</page><page sequence="10">222 MR. hardy's monster and letters, often lifting speeches virtually verbatim from his sources. But for many scenes speech was inadequate?how do you speak great battles, and the movements of armies and fleets??and for those he often relied on elaborate stage di rections (sometimes an entire scene that was nothing but stage direction ) and on Dumb Shows. To get the sense of the Phantoms' remoteness from human actions he invented zoom shots that come down out of infinity, and at the other end of the scale ground-level closeups of the smallest creatures (as in the extraordinary lyric passage about the animals at Waterloo ). The whole is an impossible monster?too long, too high, too large-scale, too small-scale, too crowded, too empty. But to Hardy it was the only form he could imagine, in which to tell the truth about human beings in history, as his philosophy defined it. When Walkley mocked the monstrosity of The Dynasts, Hardy replied: "There was available no . . . other form that would readily allow of the necessary compression of space and time. I believe that any one who should sit down and consider at leisure how to present so wide a sub ject within reasonable compass would decide that this was, broadly speaking, the only way." The first critics did not, alas, see it like that. When the first part appeared in 1904 a few reviewers wrote admiringly of what Hardy had accomplished?Max Beerbohm called the play "a noble achievement, impressive, memorable"?but most were harshly, and sometimes patronizingly, disapprov ing. They criticized the form ("uncouth and forbidding"), the verse ( "halting, turgid, and singularly lacking in music" ), the philosophy ("Could any doctrine have been chosen . . . more fatal to the interest of the drama?"), and the language ("stiffly brocaded"). One critic complained that Hardy's Spirits "never speak without expressing a banal thought in the worst verse," and another described the historical con tent as "the dead facts of school-book history." Even Hardy's friend William Archer had his reservations: "Its inspiration is not only grandiose, but truly sublime," he wrote; but he added</page><page sequence="11">SAMUEL HYNES 223 that "its form is unhappily chosen ... it is like a statue carved with a jack-knife instead of a chisel." What these early critics were objecting to was the play's monstrosity, which they described in various ways?uncouth, unactable, forbidding. In their condemnations most of the OED definitions of monster appear: the deviation from the norm, the incongruous elements, the vast and unwieldy pro portions. The criticisms are harsh, but we must accept that they were valid then, and are valid now. It's no good ignoring the play's evident eccentricities: if we value The Dynasts, we must do so honestly, seeing it in its own difficult place in history, the last of the Victorian monsters. Hardy, stretching toward epic, was like McGonagall straining for tragedy?a poet beyond the end of a tradition, trying to stand at his own point in history, and yet to reach back and make connections with the past. And that is the way monsters are born. But why attempt epic at all? There was nothing in Hardy's literary career up to 1900 to suggest such an ambition: he was a successful, and latterly a controversial novelist, who when his novel-writing came to an end wrote some lyric and nar rative poems. At sixty he might well have retired from the life of letters altogether, and devoted himself to gardening, or to his pets, or to the Dorset Natural History and Archaeo logical Society. Instead he began a seven-year struggle with the Napoleonic wars. One answer to that question is the Victorian monster maker's answer: Hardy wrote The Dynasts to see if he could write "the longest English drama in existence." Another pos sible answer is almost antithetical to that one. It's the classical answer: Hardy wrote The Dynasts because he believed that poets in their old age should write epic and tragic poetry. In his later years he associated himself with the old poets of ancient Greece?with Homer, who "sang as a blind old man," Aeschylus, who "wrote his best up to his death at nearly seventy," Sophocles, whose best work "appeared between his fifty-fifth and ninetieth years," Euripides, who "wrote up to seventy." That was high company to claim kinship with; to</page><page sequence="12">224 MR. HARDY'S MONSTER do so, Hardy would have to write to their scale, and with their tragic power. But he would have to do it without their gods. There is one other possible explanation of Hardy's motives, and it is a personal one that comes out of Hardy's Wessex world. In Wessex the English wars with Napoleon had already grown out of history into myth by the time Hardy was born in 1840. Old men remembered their soldiering days, and there were still casual relics of local preparations against Napoleon's invasion to be seen around (Hardy describes them in the preface to The Trumpet-Major). If those were epic wars, they were also Wessex wars; Hardy could tell that story with out leaving his imaginative home, and wanted to, because it belonged to his world. But of course it was more than a Wessex story: it was an English story, a patriotic story, and Hardy was a deeply patriotic man. It must have seemed to him that those years between 1805 and 1815 were the last stretch of English his tory that could possibly by imagined in epic terms. In 1902, when he began to write Part First, the Boer war had just ended without glory; the wars before that had been minor colonial actions, and before them there was the Crimean War, best known for a foolish cavalry charge and filthy hospitals. One had to go back to the century's beginning to find a good, and epic, English war. In the wars with Napoleon, Hardy seemed to have what he needed?a personal, regional, national epic. And in Nelson and Wellington he had two potential epic heroes ( and in Nel son's case perhaps a tragic hero, too ). Yet as Hardy tells the story neither man achieves epic stature: Nelson dies in Part First, and Wellington, though victor in the final action, is so held in, so enclosed in his strategies, as to emerge at the end not as a hero, but simply as the commander who wins. Only one man in The Dynasts stands to epic scale?Na poleon, the hugest figure in nineteenth-century European his tory, a kind of romantic monster of ambition on the world's stage. In his own eyes Napoleon Bonaparte in the play is the supreme epic hero, the man who would "shoulder Christ from the topmost niche in human fame." To the Wessex peasants he</page><page sequence="13">SAMUEL HYNES 225 is literally a monster: "They say that He lives upon human flesh," Kezia Cantle says, "and has rashers o' baby every morn ing for breakfast." But?and here the philosophy enters to subvert the epic enterprise?to the Phantom Intelligences of Hardy's Over World Napoleon is neither hero nor monster, but only another self-deluded human puppet. In the final human scene of the play, after the Battle of Waterloo, the Spirit of the Years addresses the defeated Napoleon: Worthless these kneadings of thy narrow thought, Napoleon; gone thy opportunity! Such men as thou, who wade across the world To make an epoch, bless, confuse, appal, Are in the elemental ages' chart Like meanest insects on obscurest leaves But incidents and grooves of Earth's unfolding; Or as the brazen rod that stirs the fire Because it must. Napoleon has imagined himself an epic hero; but, the Spirits tell him, he was wrong. He has conquered Europe and has made himself an emperor; but here at the play's end his achievements are denied their magnitude, and diminish as though the telescope through which Napoleon viewed his career had suddenly been reversed. You see the shrinking of his epic grandeur in the collapsed scale of the language itself in that passage?from world and epoch and ages down to meanest and obscurest. That is what Hardy's Spirit World does: it subverts human claims to greatness. And yet . . . toe have read Napoleon's story with human eyes. We have been witnesses at Austerlitz and Jena and Moscow and Waterloo, and what we have seen was not mean or obscure: terrible, yes; but splendid, too. The Spirits from their remoteness diminish wars and heroes, and we readers hear what they say; but we hear their cold abstractions as philosophical possibilities, we don't feel them as the truth about the world: we don't cease to be human. The voices of</page><page sequence="14">226 MR. hardy's monster the Over World, resonating with human responses, make the dissonant chord of understanding that we call irony. That chord sounds through all of Hardy's works: the world's in difference untunes compassion, love strikes against law, the human and the abstract universal meet to question and deny each other. This dissonance is as evident in Hardy on war as on any other subject. Look at the "War Poems" in Poems of the Past and the Present, written just before Hardy began The Dynasts. You will find in them the steady tender sympathy for life's victims that is constant in Hardy's work?for poor Drummer Hodge, for the wives and sweethearts of the sol diers, for all the slain?and a sad regret that war should inflict such suffering. But you'll also find another note, an excite ment at the idea of war. And that is not surprising: this is the same Hardy who loved to visit old soldiers and old battle fields, who cherished local relics of the Napoleonic wars, and the recollections of village veterans. Let's pause to look a little closer at the last poem in the "War Poems" sequence, "The Sick Battle-God." This one is not specifically about the Boer war, but is a kind of history of human belligerence. It begins: In days when men found joy in war, A God of Battles sped each mortal jar; The peoples pledged him heart and hand, From Israel's land to isles afar. But all that, the poem says, is coming to an end: war is going out of fashion. The poem ends: Yet wars arise, though zest grows cold; Wherefore, at times, as if in ancient mould He looms, bepatched with paint and lath; But never hath he seemed the old! Let men rejoice, let men deplore, The lurid Deity of heretofore</page><page sequence="15">SAMUEL HYNES 227 Succumbs to one of saner nod; The Battle-god is god no more. Here, at the end of Victoria's reign, a Victorian poet subscribes to the Victorian faith in the moral evolution of humankind. We must believe that in 1900 Hardy really believed that?or at least wanted to believe it. In those closing lines there is satisfaction in moral progress. But there is also something else, something jarring?a note of nostalgia for war as it used to be. One shouldn't be surprised to find this in Hardy: such nostalgia is common in men (and for all I know in women too ) when they look back at the old wars and the battles that will not be fought again. Hardy shared another belief about war with his Victorian contemporaries that colors his war-writings: he believed that war could be fought decently, that it was reasonable to ex pect chivalry in military behavior. His favorite example of such behavior was the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745, when a British officer is said to have invited his French opponents to fire first. The French commander replied: "We never fire first; you fire first." The anecdote appears in Hardy's letters and in "Then and Now," a World War i poem. One can see in Hardy's mind at the turn of the century a jangle of dissonances concerning war. And so it is in The Dynasts. Human suffering is treated with customary compas sion?not only the soldiers who march and struggle and die, but the women who follow them to Salamanca and to Mos cow, the deserters, the civilians, everyone caught up in war. But war itself is not diminished: the battles remain epic, gi gantic in their movements and their devastations. One can't say that The Dynasts is either pro war or antiwar: war is sim ply another of the world's dissonances, another unresolved irony. The wars with Napoleon were for Hardy the last possible epic story, I have said. One might also say that the first decade of this century, when he wrote The Dynasts, was the last time when a poet could treat war?any war?in epic terms, how</page><page sequence="16">228 MR. hardy's monster ever ironically. Then came the first world war, and ended all that. The Great War, they called it, and The War that Would End War; but it might more appropriately have been called The Ultimate Victorian Monster, for that's what it was?a world war, fought on a vaster scale than any previ ous war in human history, greater in number of combatants, greater in human suffering and death than the wars that The Dynasts enacted, because the technology that the Victorians so celebrated made it possible. But in no sense an epic war? simply a meaningless slaughter that went on and on. At this point monster-theory changes. The Great War was the Ultimate Victorian Monster; but to us it is simply The First World War, the first term in a sequence of terrible but expected historical events: monstrosity has become normal, and those objects and occasions that in the nineteenth cen tury seemed abnormal, huge, incongruous, off-the-scale pro digies are simply reality?the way we live now. Once Canary Wharf is there bullying the London skyline, the Victoria Tower becomes just another building; once The Cantos is published, the Dawn in Britain seems neither so long nor so peculiar as it did. The restraints have been off too long; there no longer are monsters. Or everything is monstrous. Hardy recognized that the first world war had brought a seismic change to human understanding. He said, just after the war, that it had destroyed his belief in the gradual en noblement of man, and that he would not have ended The Dynasts as he did?with the hopeful chorus of the Pities? if he could have foreseen what was going to happen in the next few years. The war seemed to him to have made The Dynasts obsolete; worse than that, it had made hope and pity irrelevant. Yet, though Hardy came to think that he had been wrong about war, audiences in two world wars found something right in The Dynasts. In the first months of the first world war the play actually had a run of several months in a Lon don theater, and got enthusiastic, patriotic reviews. "This play may well stir the imagination and steel the heart more than any other representation of English language and great</page><page sequence="17">SAMUEL HYNES 229 ness," said the Athenaeum; and the Times called it "a fine, in spiriting act of patriotism working through art." That doesn't quite sound like the epic-drama I've been talking about, does it? And indeed it wasn't: it was Harley Granville Barker's Dynasts. Barker had hacked and lopped and trimmed the text down to a play roughly the length of Henry V, a reasonable evening-in-the-theater size, reducing the action to English victories, and shrinking the Spirits' business to stage direc tions and a bit of bland moralizing. It's a brilliant piece of editing; but the result is The Dynasts played on one string, deflated and stripped of its monstrosity, its ironic, sinister, mocking voices silenced, its sense of the horror of war blotted out, its empty vastness shrunk to the scale of Shakespeare's hollow O. It is The Dynasts for patriots, good news for a bad time. Twenty-five years later England fought in another world war, and once more The Dynasts was seen to be a supremely relevant text. June 2, 1940, was the centenary of Hardy's birth, and there were public speeches (Stanley Baldwin spoke in Dorchester) and leading articles in the newspapers. June 2 was also the last day but one in the English evacuation of Dunkirk. On that dark day the critics, journalists, and poli ticians who commemorated Hardy turned to The Dynasts, and found there resources with which to confront this new national disaster. "It is in accord with the eternal irony of things," Philip Tomlinson wrote in the Times Literary Sup plement, "that it is to this poet who was called pessimist and other meaningless names we can turn to find fortitude and the safety of justice and calmness. From the monumental 'Dynasts' can be drawn many exemplars of deportment now we stand on the threshold of fate. ... It presents a panorama of Europe when England was imperilled as now it is and also a mirror of England's soul." It's another highly selective read ing; one can't deny that what Tomlinson found is there, and it was the right message for the occasion. But there is more to The Dynasts than lessons in deportment for embattled Englishmen. A more acute reading of The Dynasts as a lesson of war</page><page sequence="18">230 MR. hardy's monster was written by a man who wasn't a literary man at all, but who was in a position that enabled him to see Hardy's drama not in relation to war alone, but in relation to the movement of history. John Maynard Keynes was present at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, and he wrote an important book about it, The Economic Consequences of the Peace. As he witnessed the diplomats at work there, Keynes thought of The Dynasts: "The proceedings of Paris all had this air of extraordinary importance and unimportance at the same time. The decisions seemed charged with consequences to the future of human society; yet the air whispered that the word was not flesh, that it was futile, insignificant, of no effect, dis sociated from events; and one felt most strongly the impres sion, described by Tolstoy in War and Peace or by Hardy in The Dynasts, of events marching on to their fated conclusion uninfluenced and unaffected by the cerebrations of Statesmen in Council." And he quoted these lines from Hardy's Battle of Waterloo, when The Spirits of the Over World look down on the armies struggling far below them: Spirit of the Years Observe that all wide sight and self-command Deserts these throngs now driven to demonry By the Immanent Unrecking. Nought remains But vindictiveness here amid the strong, And there amid the weak an impotent rage. Spirit of the Pities Why prompts the Will so senseless-shaped a doing? Spirit of the Years I have told thee that It works unwittingly, As one possessed, not judging. Keynes saw that the Great War had not made The Dynasts obsolete?it had made it credible, Over World and all. Hardy had imagined a war, vast in its numbers, its movements, and its destructiveness, a force of devastation beyond human con</page><page sequence="19">SAMUEL HYNES 231 trol, in which men were powerless, except to kill, a war that could only be represented in language that expressed a double scale?and a double, ironic vision of history. It was a mon strous story, its epic possibilities subverted by cosmic irony, its epic battles huge, and yet shrunk to insect wars, its hero isms diminished to puppet-play. And in the end "Nought re mains/But vindictiveness here amid the strong,/And there amid the weak an impotent rage." To Keynes those lines seemed an apt epigraph not only for the war but for the peace conference (and, one might add, for all the peace conferences that have met since then, and are meeting now). The events of the conference had an air of "extraordinary importance and unimportance at the same time": Hardy had got that contradiction right, and The Dynasts seemed to Keynes a truth-telling work, an appropri ate monster for the time. Where Keynes in 1919 saw a world of contradictions, Tom linson in 1940 saw essential Englishness. The disparity is un derstandable?different times elicit different readings, the great work shapes itself to history's occasions. But though they differ, the two interpretations share one fundamental conviction?that The Dynasts is of a grandeur and magnitude that makes it an appropriate work to invoke when the fates of men and nations are at stake. They agree that The Dynasts is epic. Not epic in the traditional sense?the term must be ex panded if it is to include Hardy's enormous drama. It must spread out to mean a work of epic length, written as a play too long to be acted; containing historical and tragic events, but treating them with contradiction, irony, and paradox; showing heroic deeds, but no epic hero; in verse and prose that ranges from the flatly pedestrian to the deeply moving; telling a vast war-story, but subverting it with an even vaster cosmic vision; a work that is monumental and universal, but is also local, and attentive to existence on the smallest possi ble scale?the earthworms at Waterloo. Those conditions may strain the meaning of the term, but epic The Dynasts certainly is, "one of the really great epics</page><page sequence="20">232 MR. HARDY'S MONSTER of our language," as another observer of the Paris Peace Con ference, Lord Esher, remarked. Critics have found something to criticize in all of its parts?its verse, its language, its length, its history, its spirit world?but they have also acknowledged its huge impressiveness, comparing it to a snow-covered mountain peak and to Stonehenge. And it is something like that?irregular, imperfect, but massive, mysterious, brood ing, a monstrous English epic, perhaps the last one.</page></plain_text>
