Most readers of Isis are unlikely to be attracted to one of the massive tomes of Auguste Comte (1798-1857), particularly an obscure work from the latter half of his career in which he under- takes the construction and diffusion of the doc- trinal basis of the "religion of humanity." There is, nevertheless, a basis for nonspecialist interest in this new edition of the Subjective Synthesis (originally published in 1856), as it represents one of the most extreme positions ever imagined on the subordination of science to social inter- ests. Far beyond a mere Baconian-style instru- mentalism, Comte proposes a moral and aes- thetic reenchantment of nature through the reconstruction of scientific knowledge within the framework of a fetishistic worldview. This "sub- jective synthesis" is, he claims, the appropriate state of knowledge for the final stage of human evolution. It is achieved by combining an "ob- jective synthesis" of scientific knowledge, such as he produced in his most famous work, the six- volume Cours de philosophie positive (1830- 1842), with the radically anthropomorphic or human-centered perspective of fetishism, the first stage of human evolution. Many of the de- tails of the resulting religious/scientific doctrine would surely strike the average reader as ludi- crous (for example, his religious triumvirate of space as the "Grand Milieu," earth as the "Grande Fetiche," and collective humanity as the "Grand Etre"; or his suggestion that the earth be understood as intentionally guiding its own evo- lution in order to produce a hospitable human environment), and yet it is worthy of respect and attention for the following reason at least: based on a sophisticated notion of theoretical under- determination, it is a socially oriented construc- tion of scientific knowledge followed to an ex- treme but logical conclusion. Most of the text, however, will have a very limited value even for the most specialized of Comte scholars. The Subjective Synthesis was intended to institute an encyclopedic system of education for the adherents of the "religion of humanity" in the form of an instruction manual for teachers. It was planned by Comte to include three parts in four volumes: the System of Posi- tive Logic; or, Treatise on Mathematical Philos- ophy (Volume 1), the System of Morality (Vol- umes 2 and 3), and the System of Industry (Volume 4). Only the first volume, that made available in this new edition by Fayard, was completed before Comte's death in September 1857. This publication primarily addresses, therefore, what Comte refers to as "positive logic" as it is formulated through a synthetic re- construction of mathematics. This reconstruction takes up almost eight hundred laborious pages of the text in its seven main chapters on arith- metic, algebra, geometry, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, integral geometry, and ra- tional mechanics. Further, the purely mathemat- ical content, as well as much of the historical orientation of these chapters, is largely a reor- ganization of several sections of Volume 1 of the Cours de philosophie positive. The much more significant material is con- tained in the preface and introduction, constitut- ing some 160 pages, which Comte devotes to the general ideas of a subjective synthesis and the positive logic. Here Comte offers a detailed ex- planation of the content and method of his neo- fetishism-what, exactly, he has in mind by re- formulating conceptions of the world on the basis of moral and aesthetic principles. This ex- planation is important subject matter for Comte scholars, yet Paul Arbousse-Bastide has pointed out that the material in this text contains no rele- vant doctrine that had not been sufficiently cov- ered in Comte's Systeme de politique positive (4 vols. 1851-1854; for Arbousse-Bastide's com- mentary, see his Doctrine de l'education univ- erselle dans la philosophie d'Auguste Comte, 2 vols. [Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1957], Vol. 2, pp. 470-473). Along with its didactic style, the novel (and quite incredible) aspect of this work is that it incorporates a numerologically based system of</page><page sequence="2">200 BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 92: 1 (2001) acrostics, in order, Comte claims, to exemplify and inspire a poetic logic. Seven-letter words (words of special significance drawn from five European languages) are formed from the first letters of each paragraph in twenty-four sections (three sections in the introduction and each of seven chapters), while the first letters of every sentence in a paragraph form special words of either seven, five, or three letters. These words are systematically categorized according to a 'universal algebra," as formulated by Comte in a publication appended within this new edition. (Also included is a publication by Pierre Laffitte explaining Comte's system of universal alge- bra.) This new edition of the Subjective Synthesis provides wide access to one of the most remark- able and, in many ways, bizarre works of human intellect ever produced. Almost certainly, how- ever, it is destined for the bookshelves of larger libraries and a handful of scholarly specialists. CHRIS MCCLELLAN</page></plain_text>
