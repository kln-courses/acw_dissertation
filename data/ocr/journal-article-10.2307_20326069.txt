<plain_text><page sequence="1">LIFE'S UNFOLDING Life's Unfolding. By Sir Charles Sherrjngton, O.M. The Thinker's Library, No. 94 (Science Section). (Pp. 124. 2s. 6d.) 'London: Watts and Co. It was a happy thought on Sir Charles Sherrington's part to reprint in compact form the earlier portion of his Gifford Lectures, dealing with life's unfolding from the synthesis of the protein molecule, through the microscopic cell on to an " organized life system centred upon itself." Here the steps are interpreted by a master of science, enriched with the mind of a philosopher and poet. He reminds us that wonder commonly vanishes with childhood ; the wonderful is taken for granted, so as to enable us to get on with life. Later, when life's pace is slackened, wonder may return. Wonder, then, is the mood in which he invites us to approach his subject, and it is indeed a wonderful retelling of the story, both vivid and accurate. One is reminded of a picture, which, having become dulled, is restored to its pristine freshness of colour by a skilful hand. Take, for example, the description of the great adventure by which our marine ancestors adapted them selves to a terrestrial existence, while their descendants still carry about the salt of the archaic sea in their internal economy. Avoiding anthropomorphism in his discussion of " higher " and 44 lower " forms of life, he still claims that " range of dominance of the environment is a feature to which the term higher can be accorded. Since mind is one of the great keys to this dominance the term is almost graded by degree of mind. At the present time man is as regards conquest of his surroundings the most successful of all living forms. On that ground we can acclaim him the highest." Sir James Goodhart in his Harveian Oration in. 1912, speaking of the passing of the predominance of morbid anatomy, humorously referred to the evolution of the biochemist as a 44 curious hybrid," and then went on to discuss with sympathetic insight the probable chemical approach to cell physiology and pathology in terms of surface tensions and coenzymes. It has proved almost startlingly prophetic. What he adumbrated, Sir Charles Sherrington here reveals more fully, and asks if deeper knowledge has detracted from the symbolism and pathos of human values. He rightly thinks it would be strange if this were so. To read this book is to understand why the author is secure in the affectionate admiration of all his confr?res.</page></plain_text>
