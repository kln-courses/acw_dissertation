Of the many books which might have borne the excellent title chosen for his William James lectures at Harvard in 1934, Pro- fessor K6hler has written one which hardly mentions values, but which moves swiftly and panoramically over complex masses of facts. "The purpose of the book," he asserts, "is philosophical," although not in the sense of reaching "general solutions of general problems." The approach is through the analysis, and, where necessary, the reconstruction of scientific concepts in order that man may be enabled to understand his place in nature. It is only fair to the author to point out that a detailed judgment of his work would call for a versatility equal to his, amounting to a familiarity with the latest developments in the fields of physics, biology, physi- ology, neurology, and psychology. Like many another scientist, he has been bothered both by the positivistic tendency to read man out of nature, and by the ex- pedients to which philosophers have resorted to escape from its consequences. The latter have tried to escape where no escape is feasible. Vitalists have attempted to separate the organic realm from inanimate nature, and to defend the former against the principles which govern the latter. Other philosophers soon began to realize how useless any resistance must be in this outlying territory. They retreated into the realm of the mind and of human culture. But Naturalism penetrated into this stronghold, too. Thus Husserl sacrificed the whole world of facts, including those of actual mental life, and took refuge in a world of pure timeless essences. It has all been in vain. . . . I do not see a single position to which we can now retreat. [P. 409.] The alternative is a fresh attack, with new weapons. As I see it, we should quietly accept [the intimate relation between mental life and biological facts] as a fact, and then examine the alleged danger.... These facts of nature have to be interpreted in a way that makes them com- patible with our experience of psychological facts. [P. 410.] The key to values, according to the author, lies in the notion of "requiredness" or "that which ought to be." The prevailing view is that "facts are or happen indifferently. There is no required- ness about them. Consequently there is no place for requiredness in a world of facts" (p. 72). Dr. K6hler undertakes to show by an extended phenomenological analysis that "certain facts do not</page><page sequence="2">108 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY only happen or exist, but, issuing as vectors in parts of contexts, extend toward others with a quality of acceptance or rejection" (p. 100). "Within certain factual contexts the requiredness or wrongness of some facts is no less real than is the existence of these facts" (p. 102). How can we bridge the apparent gulf between the so-called "physical world" and the realms of value? The answer is by the principle of isomorphism by which all sensory qualities are assumed to have cortical correlates, requiredness along with the rest (pp. 194-195). In an argument much too involved to summarize, the author holds that macroscopic physical states rather than microscopic events give the clue to the structural isomorphism of requiredness and its cortical correlate (p. 224). This introduction of fields and forces brings him into admittedly dangerous ground from the point of view of physics, which has learned to distrust the allegedly anthropomorphic notion of "force" of any kind. Yet the contemporary horror of falling into anthro- pomorphism should not be permitted to blind us to the fact that man, as both the child of inorganic nature and the builder of the science of physics, is "the most challenging subject-matter of that discipline" (p. 393). Even supposing requiredness to have been discovered among the facts of nature, it is obvious that many examples of it conflict with one another. "Mere requiredness as such occurs within the mental processes of insane and of feeble-minded people." But, although his analysis sheds little direct light on the conflicts among values, Dr. K:ohler believes that he has "now overcome some dif- ficulties of principle" that were blocking important advances (p. 411). So necessarily sketchy an outline can give hardly more than a hint of the keen, wide-ranging, and original thought which has gone into these lectures, and which should supply subjects for ex- periments among scientists as well as for debate among philoso- phers. To read them calls for the closest attention to frequent changes of method and of point of view, and also for patience with a hybrid style. The distinguished Gestalt psychologist is well aware that he has "ended his investigation at a stage in which there are few answers and countless questions"; but he should be credited with a rare willingness to risk new and adventurous hy- potheses in difficult fields, where few scientists of his competence have dared even to risk philosophizing in public.
