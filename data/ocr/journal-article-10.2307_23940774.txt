<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two Conceptions of Personality by Anthony Quinton I. The Distinction Between Persons and Things The distinction between persons and things is the most funda mental way of dividing up the contents of the world. It is so funda mental, indeed, that it is hard to say anything general about it without lapsing into platitude. To start with we think of ourselves as essentially persons and onlyrathercontingently asmaterialobjects, mammals, carnivores, husbands, bureaucrats, numismatists and so forth. This is because we stand in a special set of relations to other persons. We are tied to them by special bonds of interest. They are the proper and primary objects of our love, friendship and moral concern. "We" and "I", after all, are personal pronouns. The main point I wish to argue for here is that there is not, in fact, one clear distinction between persons and things but that we implicitly recognise two different kinds or levels of personality. The prime example of the first of these is the adult human being, fully equipped with reason, the power of self-direction and moral capacity. Complete persons in this sense are responsible agents and we can stand to them in reciprocal relations of love and affection. But as well as these there is a second, limited kind of person who exhibits some measure of intellect and will but who is not fully self-conscious, nor capable of abstract reasoning, nor reflectively self-directing. Young children, certain kinds of mental defective and perhaps some of the higher mammals exhibit personality of this second, limited kind. Limited persons can be the objects of moral concern and of particular affection but they are not morally responsible agents and we cannot enter into genuinely reciprocal personal relations with them. The justification of this conclusion will be provided by an</page><page sequence="2">388 ANTHONY QUINTON examination of five criteria which have been suggested for the distinction between persons and things. These are consciousness, rationality, will, moral status and capacity for personal relations. Although distinguishable these criteria are not wholly independent, for some presuppose others. In each case, I shall argue, there are two possible interpretations of the criterion in question, one stronger and one weaker, which draw the line between persons and other things in a different place. But I shall not begin by trying to establish this duality. After showing that most philosophers of the past and present tend to accept without much question that there is a single distinction between persons and things I shall consider the simplest possible account that could be given of that distinction. This simplest account identifies persons with men, with human beings, with those who are or have living human bodies. Such an account would be the most immediate and unreflective answer to a question about the nature of the distinction between persons and things. It has also recently received some philosophical support. By showing its obvious inadequacy I hope to establish the claim of the less super ficial criteria, whose duality I am concerned to demonstrate, to be taken seriously. 2. Philosophical Articulations of the Distinction Aristotle's conception of a person is embodied in the exemplary definition : 'man' = 'rational animal'. In the De Anima it is the possession of rational souls that is said to distinguish men within the class of living and mortal beings, in other words of animals. Plants, since they nourish and reproduce themselves, are accorded vegetative souls. Sensitive souls are ascribed to non-human ani mals by reason of their appetites and feelings and the fact that they can move themselves around. But men alone, among terrestrial beings at any rate, have reason. Aristotle's definition does not re quire that men as he defines them, but we had better say persons, should have human bodies. (Since persons are rational animals no disembodied intellect can be a person, in particular not the divine prime mover of the universe, rapt in selfcontemplation.) If there were such a thing as a rational dog, in Aristotle's rather strong sense of the word ' rational', it would be a rational animal and thus a man, or rather person. Aristotle was not wholly unaware of such a</page><page sequence="3">ANTHONY QUINTON 389 possibility. He speaks of 'an order of animate beings, i. e. man and possibly another order like man or superior to him, has the power of thinking, i. e. mind'. (De Anima 414b, 20). Descartes is the source of the other main traditional conception of personality. Unlike Aristotle he denies that any state of mind can be literally ascribed to any non-human animal. Consciousness, the possession of mental states, is for him the defining peculiarity of one of the two great classes of substances in which everything is included. These thinking substances are not rational in Aristotle's sense simply. For Descartes the term ' thinking' extends beyond the abstractly intellectual activities of the rational soul to take in all forms of consciousness or mental life whatever. Men are not the only thinking substances ; God is a thinking substance too. Further more, if we may take ' thinking substance' as Descartes' definition of 'person', it follows that persons for him are only contingently em bodied. Some persons are, as a matter of fact and for some part of their history, embodied but none, it would seem, logically must be, even at any time in their history. But if persons, souls or thinking substances ever are embodied it seems that the bodies they animate are always human. This is as true of God, who was incarnated as a man, as it is of finite spirits. Locke adopts very much the same conception of personality as Descartes. A person, he says, is ' a thinking intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can consider itself as itself the same thinking thing in different times and places which it does by that consciousness which is inseparable from thinking and as it seems to me essential to it.' (Essay on Human Understanding II. 27. 9). He diverges from Descartes in disentangling this idea from that of a spirit or spiritual substance. He generally treats the latter as a holy mystery but desecrates it from time to time by the supposition that God might have annexed the power of thought (in the wide, Carte sian sense) to material substance. He clearly distinguishes persons from men. By implication he defines 'man' as 'living human body', arguing that it would be ' a very strange use of the word man applied to an idea out of which body and shape are excluded' (Essay 11.27.6). This Lockian convention about the use of the word ' man', which I shall adopt, conforms with a familiar theological usage. Christian theology asserts that God is a person (and also three persons). It also condemns anthropomorphism, the idea that God is, in non personal respects, like a man, in other words that, apart from</page><page sequence="4">390 ANTHONY QUINTON the brief episode of the Incarnation, he is or has a living human body. The kind of dualism espoused by Descartes and Locke persists, with various qualifications, in recent philosophy. In Europe Heideg ger has elaborated the concept of Dasein, the peculiarly human kind of existence, and Sartre has emphasised the difference between human existence as pour-soi and the existence en-soi of mere things. In the English-speaking world the recognition of the philosophy of mind as a specific discipline admits that there are special problems about the knowledge of persons, both the knowledge they have about themselves and the knowledge they have of each other. British and American philosophers have been much exercised in recent years about the problem of a person's identity through time. Even if some of them have argued that bodily identity is essential to the identity of a person, it is generally agreed that personal identity is not obviously or wholly the same thing as the identity of a living human body. It is a central contention of Strawson's Individuals that persons and material bodies are the two primitive and mutually irreducible kinds of basic particular. 3. Persons as Men If one were asked in an ordinary, practical connection, by someone, for example, with a limited knowledge of English, what a person is, one would probably reply that a person is a man or a human being. In doing so one would have the support of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary which gives as the first three senses of the word : 'a part played in a drama or in life', 'a individual human being' and 'the living body of a human being'. For the practical purpose in hand this identification of persons with human beings is good enough. But it has its theoretical limitations. Theologians want to describe God, angels and the departed spirits of the dead as persons. If this is objectionable on the ground that the things in question are disem bodied there are plenty of embodied but non-human claimants to the title of person. First there are animals, in particular the higher mam mals, who display some of the characteristic marks of personality and with whom we can enter into something like the typically per sonal relations. Secondly, there is the possibility that there are, on other planets, forms of non-human life for which a reasonable</page><page sequence="5">TWO CONCEPTIONS OF PERSONALITY 391 claim to personality might be made out. Let us, for convenience, call them Martians. Finally there is the possibility that mechanical analogues of human beings might be constructed by engineers of the not too distant future which would satisfy the criteria, whatever they may be, of personality. On the other side there are or could be human beings that are not persons. There are children, at any rate very young children. There are human beings who suffer from radical mental deficiency. There are the senile or seriously injured human beings who have lapsed into a more or less vegetable condition and have become the immobile absorbers of nourishment, without memory or sometimes even consciousness. At various points in history other large classes of human beings have been in effect denied personality : women, foreigners, barbarians or savages variously defined and, overlapping them, Aristotle's class of slaves by nature. The denial of personality to any class of human beings has obvious moral implications. It can be done only in the teeth of a powerful tradition of the moral equali ty of all men. Human embryos constitute a slightly puzzling case. Some would deny that they are really human beings because of their systematic biological dependence on the mother. An embryo, it might be said, is not a subsistent individual, but is part of the mothers's body, no more capable of surviving detachment from it, until a fairly late stage, than her limbs are. Yet every human being is strongly con tinuous with some embryo in a way that would make it reasonable to regard them as one and the same organism. On the other side the personality of embryos is a matter of dispute. It would seem to be asserted by those who regard abortion as murder and is clearly affirmed by those who backup such a judgement with the statement that embryos have souls. In view of these unclarities embryos are available for consideration both as non-human persons and as human non-persons. These examples provide some intuitive basis for criticising the view that the concepts of person and of human being are one and the same. But the view has had philosophical support. Wittgenstein said that'the human body is the best picture of the human soul'. Norman Malcolm started from this text in arguing against the conten tion of H. H. Price that the intelligent use of language is the soundest basis for attributing personality to anything other than oneself. Malcolm says ' no amount of intelligible sounds coming from an oak</page><page sequence="6">392 ANTHONY QUIN TON tree or a kitchen table would create any probability that it has sen sations and thoughts'. We can ascribe a mind, he goes on, only to those emitters of linguistic sounds whose understanding of the words they emit we can test. 'Since it has nothing like the human face and body it makes no sense to say of a tree, or an electronic computer, that it is looking or pointing at or fetching something'. Now Wittgenstein said only that the human body is the best picture of the human soul, not that it is the only conceivable one. Malcolm's examples of non-human things to which it would be a mistake to ascribe personality are very non-human indeed. He might not reject in the same way the personification of a dog or of the kind of friendly robot encountered in science fiction. Yet he emphasises for purposes of dissent Price's view that 'the body from which these informative sounds proceed need not be a human body'. This emphasis implies that only human bodies could provide the sort of evidence on which it would be intelligible to assert the existence of another person. Failure to distinguish between the concepts of a person and of a human being is more common than their outright identification. (Even Sydney Shoemaker, who does draw the distinction, countenan ces only the possibility of non-personal humans and not that of non human persons.) It is perhaps an unnoticed consequence of the widespread anti-Cartesian conviction that persons must be embodied. If this conviction is combined with Descartes' other view that all embodiment of person is human it follows that persons and human beings are one and the same. Descartes elaborated his idea that embodied persons must be human with the claim that animals are automata. Recent philosophers, influenced by Wittgenstein, have approximated to this position in saying that since animals do not use language only a very contracted range of mental predicates can be ascribed to them in anything but a very figurative sense. But the application of even a restricted range of mental predicates would imply that animals have minds. However to admit that animals have minds, of a low-grade variety, may fall short of admitting that they are, or could ever possibly be, persons. 4. Consciousness The idea that persons and human beings are one and the same is, then, intuitively unplausible. Malcolm's argument for it rests on</page><page sequence="7">TWO CONCEPTIONS OF PERSONALITY 393 the bare and rather obviously false assertion that no non-human thing, no dog or robot, could be sufficiently like a human being in its appearance and conduct to provide the kind of evidence we have for ascribing personality to human beings other than ourselves. To identify persons with human beings is to use for the distinction of persons from things the simplest conceivable kind of marks, speci fically a certain range of shapes, sizes and styles of physical move ment. I want to turn now to some less superficial criteria which do not distinguish persons from things in the light of straightforwardly observable characteristics and which either have the weight of philo sophical tradition behind them (consiousness, rationality, will) or help to explain why the distinction of persons from things has the special interest for us that it has (moral status, capacity for personal relations). The concept of consciousness, which is the first I shall consider, seems to be open, at first glance, to three different interpretations. On the widest of these a conscious being is one that is sometimes conscious of things : it does have mental states ; some mental predi cates can be literally ascribed to it. This notion might appear to be distinguishable from a primary form of self-consciousness which requires that a conscious being should be sometimes aware of its own mental states. But a being could be conscious in this second sense, in other words could be self-conscious in a primary way, without being self-conscious in the sense of Locke's formula, without being able to 'consider itself as itself the same thinking thing in different times and places'. What makes it possible to distinguish the first two senses of 'conscious' is the fact that there are mental states whose owners are unaware of them. But the fact that there are mental states which do not necessarily intimate themselves to their owners does not require us to admit two corresponding kinds of conscious being. The reason is that unconscious mental states are logically parasitic on conscious ones. We can ascribe mental states to a being that is not aware of them only if there are some mental states of which he is aware. It is impossible that there should be a being who had mental states of the existence of a 11 of which he was entirely unaware. One might say : not all mental states are experiences but nothing could have mental states that did not have experiences. But we do have to distinguish primary from secondary self consciousness. It would be gratuitous to deny that animals occupy</page><page sequence="8">394 ANTHONY qUINTON ing a comparatively modest, lower middleclass position in the evolutionary hierarchy, such as rats and ducks, are in pain or frightened or even angry, in a perfectly literal sense of those words and also, if it makes any difference, that they are aware of the fact. But this would notcommitusto the view that such a rat or duck had a conception of ' itself as itself the same thinking thing in different times and places', a conception, that is, of its own continuing identity. This leaves us with a weaker and a stronger version of the con sciousness criterion. A being is conscious in the weak sense if it is sometimes aware of its own mental states ; it is conscious in the strong sense if it is aware of its own continuing identity. Are all human beings conscious in the weak sense? None of us all the time ; we usually spend part of each 24-hour period fast asleep. But when we are asleep we can easily regain consciousness of this sort ; we have not lost the capacity for it. In this respect ordinary human beings differ from the very senile, from people in irreversible comas and possibly from some very backward and very new-born infants. It is conceivable that there should be a human being who re mained in a coma from birth to death, taking nourishment and digesting it and performing other such autonomous physical func tions required for its continued vitality. Such a creature would never be conscious at all in the weak sense and yet would be human in all strictly bodily respects. Here the capacity for weak conscious ness, which is what the criterion must be if it is to include us, in view of our sleeping habits, is never acquired. In the case of some one in a senile coma can we not say that, while he was a conscious being, he is so no longer? We can reconcile the idea that somebody who has lost the ca pacity for weak consciousness is no longer really a person with hesitation about euthanasia by taking account of the fact that there is inevitably a step of conjecture between the recognition that someone is now in a senile coma and the claim that his loss of capacity for weak consciousness is now irreversible and final. Thus if the capacity for weak consciousness is adopted as the criterion of personality there are human beings who are not persons while personality must be accorded to the other kinds of human being the denial of whose personality is morally repugnant : women, foreigners, slaves, ordinary mental defectives. Turning to the other kind of borderline case, that of personal non-humans ; there can be no doubt that many animals are at least</page><page sequence="9">TWO CONCEPTIONS OF PERSONALITY 395 conscious in the weaker sense. We have as good reason to attribute pain, fear and excitement to the higher non-human mammals as we have for attributing them to foreigners whose language we do not understand. Descartes can never have owned a dog. The stronger form of the consciousness criterion is harder to apply. The best ground for attributing to someone a conception of his own continuing identity is linguistic behaviour, in particular the ability to use the first personal pronoun, above all in recalling events from the speaker's past history. If this is indispensable for consciousness in the stronger sense then not all human beings are so conscious. There are human imbeciles who cannot be taught to speak at all, yet who still experience pain and fear. It also follows that the persons by this criterion that we know to exist are human. But there could be appropriately conversational animals or Martians or machines, not mere word-emitters like budgerigars and talk-your weight machines, but non-human beings whose linguistic behaviour adds up to a total project much like our own, who are taught by being shown things, who can construct apt and novel combinations out of previously mastered vocabulary and so on. Is this too exigent a criterion for consciousness of one's own identity ? Dog-owners who catch their pets out in morally question able conduct like to attribute remorse to them. But remorse implies self-condemnation and thus consciousness of one's identity. This is a weak argument, however, since the phenomena can be more economically interpreted, as the expression of mild fear. I shall not pursue this question since it is clear that non-human beings coule be strongly conscious, whether any actually are or not. 5. Bationality In seeking to elucidate the Aristotelian criterion of rationality there is one purported sense of the word that can be ruled out at the start. It cannot usefully be taken to mean the capacity of com puters and adding-machines to perform deductions, to derive con clusions from premises. Calculating machines, as we know them, reason only very figuratively. There is no basis for supposing that they understand the statements that are fed into and extracted from them. Their achievements are only a very limited analogue of ordi nary human deductions. They are so constructed that when brought</page><page sequence="10">396 ANTHONY QUINTON into an initial state corresponding to certain premises they will change into a state that corresponds with, and from which can be read off, certain conclusions. This is no more than a small fragment of what is involved in the characteristic intellectual activities of a rational human being. He has to identify a problem, as relevant to the satisfaction of some need (even his curiosity will not have the imposed, gratuitous character of a machine's), to select or discover appropriate premises and then he has to criticise the solution, when the problem is practical, in the light of what it is feasible for him to do. If a truly rational machine is to be planned it will have to be vastly more complicated in conception than a calculating machine. Things that can do a little bit of a rational project, however fast and accurately, are not on that account rational. There remain two principal ways in which rationality can be shown. There is first concrete or practical rationality, displayed in selecting appropriate means to desired ends, and, secondly, there is the abstract and theoretical rationality that generalises, predicts and explains. Anything endowed with the former would be said to show intelligence. It is not to be found in the new-born or the senile or in any of the types of human being that are not conscious in the first and weaker of the senses discussed in the last section. It is to be found, however, in animals, wherever they engage in well judged sequences of actions which cannot be explained by instinct but only by way of learning from experience. The celebrated chimpanzees who fitted the sticks together to reach the bananas come inevitably to mind. Abstract rationality, Aristotle's speculative reason, would seem to require the mastery of language. Without linguistic ex pression the evidence for a being's possession of a theory is equally evidence for the simpler and more economical hypothesis of a con ditioned response. Yet it would seem possible to conceive a pattern of animal behaviour that was cognitively experimental in the man ner of human scientific inquiry and neither random casting around for the satisfaction of a present con-cognitive need nor the intensified repetition of a usually succesful routine. (Cf. R. Kirk, Rationality Without Language, in Mind, 1967) At any rate non-human beings could satisfy the requirements of the most exigent account of theo retical rationality. There could be talking animals, Martians and robots in a sense of ' talking' that implies genuine mastery of a lan guage and not the mere ability to utter articuate linguistic sounds.</page><page sequence="11">TWO CONCEPTIONS OF PERSONALITY 397 In general concrete rationality would seem to correspond to the weaker sense of consciousness, abstract rationality to the stronger sense. Where the former prevails thought and awareness are tied to the immediate spatial and temporal environment. The strongly conscious being is aware of itself as a continuing thing and thus of a distinct world of continuing objects set over against it. Such a world of continuing objects is the framework for the exercise of abstract rationality. 6. Will Existentialists have held the special precidament of men to be their consciousness of freedom, of the need for choice. As a criterion of personality this redirects from the past to the future Locke's idea of consciousness of one's continuing identity hitherto. A person, for Locke, is one who is aware of the identity of his present self with something in the past ; for the existentialist he is one who must now decide what he is to be in the future. A person is one who is aware of alternatives for choice, who acknowledges responsibility for his own acts. It is usually added that men can conceal this from them selves by living inauthentically, in accordance with established roles or habits or the expectations that others have about them. To the extent that a man does do this he is so much the less a person. To live inauthentically is to regress to the condition of a mere thing. This view is a strong version of the requirement that to be a person one must be active, self-determining, the possessor of a will. But there is a weaker version of the same general idea. A being can still be said to be active, an agent, as long as its movements and behaviour are motivated, the outcome of desire and not wholly explicable by references to non-mental causal influences. This second, weaker conception of activity is not very clear, no clearer than the concept of desire or motivation. But at least it is better than to say that an active being is one whose behaviour is not wholly determined by factors external to it, a development of the idea of self-determination. For where is the line to be drawn between the internal and the external ? What is external about the physiolo gical mechanism that is responsible for some instinctive reflex in comparison with a desire? To become clearer about the nature of desire we should need to consider why it is figurative to say that a door does not want to open</page><page sequence="12">398 ANTHONY qUINTON but not figurative to say that a cat does not want to eat. The door offers resistance like a literal agent ; if forced it may make a noise fancifully interpretable as a cry of pain. But the analogy is really a very limited one. Once forced open the door remains open and shows neither resentment nor disturbance. It does not initiate any movement when in a quiescent condition. Its range of activities is minute compared to that of even a rather lowgrade animal. In general a thing's tendency to act in a certain way will be called a desire only when the thing is at least conscious in the weaker sense, at least the possessor of feelings. A being that is active in this weaker sense does in a way make choices. Its desires prompt it to behave in a certain way in a situation where there is no obstacle but those desires to its behaving differently and the desires in question need be neither fixed instincts common to the entire species nor permanent features of the agent's constitution. But such an agent could choose without being aware of a choice, without recognising alternative possibilities and without deliberating between them. It could desire at a given moment to pursue two incompatible policies and hesitate between them, loo king perhaps from one object of desire to the other. But this need not amount to genuine deliberation for that would seem to involve bringing the situation under some general principle of choice, an exercise of abstract, theoretical reason. The stronger sense of activity involves conscious, principled choice. It is parallel to consciousness of one's continuing identity and to abstract rationality in that unless an agent has the mastery of a language it is always more economical to interpret behaviour, which in a language-user would be regarded as the result of delibera tion, as merely hesitant or obstructed or flummoxed. A simple collision of impulses, which works itself out in the end in one way or the other, is a less presumptuous explanation of a delayed response to incompatible objects of desire than a hypothesis about reasoned choice unless the linguistic capacity is present which enables reasons to be given. If activity in the strong sense does imply linguistic capacity proper it involves the same inclusions and exclusions from the class of persons as the corresponding strong criteria of con sciousness and rationality. Not all human beings are agents in this strong sense and the only such agents we know of are human, but non-human beings could be agents in the strong sense if they had the mastery of a language.</page><page sequence="13">TWO CONCEPTIONS OF PERSONALITY 399 7. Moral status The concept of personality figures in an essential way in moral thinking. On the one hand it is to persons that moral rules of con duct are addressed. It is important to distinguish this rather obvious truth from something rather more controversial. It is often held that the distinguishing feature of moral rules of conduct is that they enjoin or forbid actions in the light of the effect of those actions on persons. Kant's first formulation of the categorical imperative, act only on principles that can be accepted by everyone, is connected with the first, rather trivial, principle that moral rules are ad dressed only to persons and also to its less trivial extension that moral rules are addressed to all persons. But this second formulation that everyone should treat all other persons (Kant actually refers here to 'humanity') as ends in themselves and never merely as means would seem to be a version of the second principle, that a moral rule of conduct must take into account the bearing of the actions it covers on every person who might be affected by it. It is possible to classify the moral systems of different commun ities and different epochs in accordance with the scope of the class whose member's interests or welfare or, more neutrally, good is taken into account by the system. What would once have been called a savage morality will take into account the good only of members of the tribe and perhaps not all of them, not women or children or the weak or the old. A rough but not gratuitous measure of the moral progress of mankind is provided by the increasing scope of the moral constituency, quite independently of the actual content of morality at different times and places. To accept this criterion of moral progress is to regard it as a criterion of an adequate or fully-developed moral system that all persons should be included in its moral constituency. Alternatively we can use membership of an ideal moral constituency as a criterion of what it is to be a person. Actual moral constituencies vary in scope. It is not unreasonable to say that members of a society with a very restricted moral constituency accord to very few the status of persons. To define a person as a member of the ideal moral constituency is going to be useful only if we have some way of rationally determin ing the scope of this constituency. On the assumption that the minimisation of suffering is the fundamental moral project it follows</page><page sequence="14">400 ANTHONY QUINTON that an adequate moral system must take into account the good of everyone who is capable of suffering. This constituency will include most but not all human beings, not, for example, the irremediably comatose. But it will include plenty of non-human beings, in parti cular animals. This broad moral conception of personality coincides with the weaker consciousness criterion. A being could not be weakly conscious if it had no capacity for suffering, since pain is the most elementary of mental states. There are familiar objections to the idea that minimisation of suffering is the fundamental moral project, (e.g. that if so the painless extinction of all sentient life must be the summum bonum). But without some such idea behind it any particular drawing of the boundaries of the moral constituency becomes gratuitous. And other conceptions of the fundamental moral project seem unsatis factory. For example, self-realisation, broadly interpreted, would imply the moral enfranchisement of trees. But if self-realisation is taken narrowly to mean the achievement of moral perfection then the moral constituency would have to be restricted to fully fledged moral agents, thus excluding mentally defective human beings and animals. This reference to agency suggests another, narrower" moral conception of personality : a person is a morally responsible agent. It coincides more or less with the stronger form of the activity criterion, having the capacity for conscious and principled choice. However psychopaths, conceived as moral imbeciles who do not understand or act on any moral principles but can nevertheless act rationally and prudently, constitute an exception to the coincidence. Kant's definition of will in terms of a being's capacity to act in accordance with its conception of a rule connects the stronger forms of the criteria of activity and rationality. Psychopaths, as I have described them, would be strongly rational and active beings who nevertheless lacked moral reason and will. If only moral agents are persons then not all human beings are persons. Equally non-human beings could be persons even in none in fact are. For moral purposes it is clear that we need to have conceptions of two large but non-coincident classes of individuals : moral agents and moral patients, the proper objects of moral concern. The dis tinction broadly coincides with the distinctions considered in con nection with consciousness, rationality and will. The notion of a per son, from the moral point of view as well as others, is dual.</page><page sequence="15">TWO CONCEPTIONS OF PERSONALITY 401 8. Personal relations The requirements of moralityprovideuswith an interest in distin guishing persons from things. We need to know who it is that moral rules apply to and for whose benefit they are drawn up. It could be argued that we have an even more fundamantal interest in distinguish ing persons as those beings with which alone we can have certain relations that are of pre-eminent importance in our emotional econo my. These are the characteristically personal relations of love and affection. It is only with persons, again, that we can communicate, act in cooperation, enter into genuinely reciprocal relationships. There is, of course, a colloquial sense of th word ' love' to mean 'like very much' where there is no restriction on its possible objects. In this sense we can love a building or a food or a sport. But the love of persons is more than this, though it is connected with it. If I like something very much I want it to be preserved or protected so that I may continue to enjoy it. But a parent's love for a child, which we may speak of, without being at all figurative, as concern for the child's interests, is not directed wholly towards the parent's own enjoyment. To love in this way is to accord to the interests of another the status that one necessarily accords to one's own. Only a being that has interests can be an appropriate object for this king of non-instrumental love. An animal or new-born baby can be loved in this way. But anyone who feels like this about a plant or a doll ar a building must be more or less playfully and, correspondingly, with less or more delusion, ascribing interests, and thus the weaker form of consciousness, to the object of their feeling. Either in play or delusion they are personifying it. We sometimes consider someone's love for a baby or animal to be excessive but it does not have the element of absurdity that is present when this sort of love is felt for a mere thing. To regard persons as possible objects of love in this sense is in effect to adopt the weak consciousness criterion for only beings that are at least weakly conscious are conceptually appropriate objects for this kind of love. Appropriate objects of love need not be themselves capable of loving in this characteristically personal way. Infants and animals can only like very much. To love another being in the personal way is to identify his interests with one's own and to do this one must</page><page sequence="16">402 ANTHONY QUJNTON have a conception of him and of oneself as distinct beings with a continuous identity and with interests. For such a conception consciousness in the strong sense is required. Of course the object of one's love can be an identity with interests without being himself aware of the fact. If we take only those who are capable of loving as persons we emerge with the narrower conception of personality that we have encountered under each of the previous criteria. Outgoing love for persons in the broad sense is important, but for most people mutual, reciprocated love is more so. The most satisfying personal relations involve mutuality and thus the complete personality of both parties to the relationship. The same is true of less ardent and emotionally intense varieties of interaction between people than love, of com munication, for example, in its developed form and not just as incitement to flight or attention, or again of cooperation, where it involves some measure of tacit understanding and is not just simul taneous joint activity towards a particular end as when a child and a dog pull at a rug together. A central place in affectionate personal relationships is occupied by the sense each party has of the unique individuality of the other. It is persons, above all, that we have a strong and persistent interest in identifying as unique individuals. It is for this reason (as I have argued elsewhere : The Soul. Journal of Philosophy, 1964.) that whatever criteria of personal identity we actually use in practice the precise thing we are concerned to identify is a particular collection of memories and traits of character. This collection, especially the memory part of it, is almost necessarily unique and unrepeatable, as contrasted with the particular human body with which it is associated. This supports the assumption I have made that the essence of personality is not to be found in the style of a person's embodiment but in the less superficial properties picked out by the five criteria I have examined. That each of these criteria is capable of a stronger and a weaker interpretation, and that the interpret ations in each group largely coincide is the basis of my claim that we must acknowledge two conceptions of personality.
