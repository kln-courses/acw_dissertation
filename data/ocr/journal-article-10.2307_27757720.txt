In their original form they covered the range of material set out in my contributions to The quantifying spirit in the 18th century, edited by Tore Fr?ngsmyr et al. (University of California Press, 1990). The original treatment included a brief section on population statistics, as a further example of connections among mathematics, the physical world, and the bureaucratic state. I had intended to develop the subject here and to extend it to cadasters, since both fit well with surveying and mensuration, which are discussed in detail, and both engaged Lavoisier and Laplace, who appear prominently in the book in other connections. Unfortunately neither time nor space permitted this desirable exten sion. A further study is underway. I am indebted to my colleagues Tore Fr?ngsmyr (Uppsala) and Giuliano Pancaldi (Bologna), co-organizers of the Summer School, for the opportunity to deliver the original lectures, and to the members of the School for their tolerance and comments. And I have the greatest pleasure in thanking Diana Wear and Peter Hout zager (Berkeley) who produced this book, for their inspired han dling of a difficult text and persnickety author.</page><page sequence="10">INTRODUCTION The bible deals ambiguously with numbers. The first book of Chronicles says that Satan put David up to counting the people of Israel and Judah. The second book of Samuel says that God did it. The accounts agree, however, that David's precocious census was a bad mistake. Numbering might be divine or devilish, but not human. "I have done a very wicked thing," David said to God. "I pray thee remove thy servant's guilt, for I have been very foolish." God gave him a choice of punishments, fittingly expressed: three years of famine, three months of military defeat, or three days of pestilence. They negotiated pestilence, and 70,000 men died, but not the numerator David.1 Mankind's uneasy relations with numbers have left plain traces in European languages. The English word "calculating" means both "computing" and "scheming." The German word "vermessen" means to measure, to mismeasure, and to be presumptuous, arro gant, and insolent. An old meaning of the Italian word "matematiz zare" was to put a hex, or cast a spell, on people. To many, the difference between a sorcerer and a mathematician was, and may be still, too small to measure. These remarks are intended to suggest that the spread of quanti tative methods and imagery throughout the science, near science, and practical activity of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, which forms the subject of this book, requires an explanation. A hundred years earlier, well-educated people got through school without learning the rule of three. Take Samuel Pepys, who did not 1. 1 Chron., 21:1-16; 2 Sam., 24:1-16. Cf.

When he became clerk to the Admiralty, he rose every day at five in the morning to learn his times tables.2 The great virtuoso Thomas Hobbes, who hobnobbed with the likes of Descartes, did not come across geometry until he was forty, and then, as he tells us, only by accident.3 There have always been those who loved mathematics for itself. A double tradition of enthusiasm descended from antiquity, which may be followed into early modern times in the prefaces to print ings of Euclid. One tradition emphasized the etymological origin of geometry in land measurement, and praised mathematics for its practical utility. The other observed God's tendency to create by number and measure, and made number the key to the first and final truths about the Universe. Here is how this second tradition spoke through one of its loudest followers, John Dee, who wrote in the 16th century. "O comfortable allurement, O ravishing perswa sion, to deal with a Science, whose subject is so Auncient, so pure, so excellent, so surmounting all creatures_By Numbers proper tie. . .we may.. .arise, clime, ascend, and mount up (with Speculative winges) in spirit, to behold in the Glas of Creation, the Forme of Formes, the Exemplar Number of all things Numerable_Who can remaine, therefore, unpersuaded, to love, allow, and honor the excellent science of Arithmatike?"4 It was not mathematics in this second sense, as a route through the ridiculous to the sublime, but mathematics as a practical means of control of everyday transac tions, that became endemic in the late 18th century. Quantification in the physical sciences, as opposed to astronomy, mechanics, and geometrical optics, first succeeded after 1750. The earliest success came by analyzing the phenomena of electricity and magnetism in terms of distance forces, whose power Newton had demonstrated in his theory of planetary motions and hinted at in his queries about everything else.

For the applied mathematician of the high Enlightenment, however, the scheme of quantitative distance forces was merely an instrument of calculation. The quantitative natural philosophy of the late 18th century was instrumentalist not only in its software, that is, in its theoretical models; but also in its hardware, in its reliance on measurements by instruments that had become much more reliable and precise since Newton's time. This reliance had that double and circular character that alarms people and even philosophers suspicious of numbers: the instruments not only made the measurement, they also pro duced the pheonomena to be measured. The more vigorously and successfully the late Enlightenment pressed its quantitative natural philosophy, the more explicitly it recognized that thereby it would not attain knowledge of the true principles of things. The instru mentalist science of the turn of the 19th century made manifest and generalized the complementarity between truth and calculation recognized much earlier by Ptolemaic astronomers. This recognition demoted natural philosophers to the spiritual level, insofar as numbers were concerned, of numerate merchants and bureaucrats. For all of them, the ostensible purpose of quanti fying their material was to control it, to order it, to increase its reach, to guess or make the future from it. This quantifying spirit spread far: we can follow it downwards from the heaven of mathematics, where it presided over the rise of algebra and analysis at the expense of geometry; thence through the spheres of the instrumentalist physical sciences; on to the forests of Germany, where every tree was counted; and at last to the caves of the lexi cographer and the classifier, who labored to inventory and control their ever increasing material, and to calculate its amount if not its meaning. A survey of such applications is now available.5 This book offers further or more detailed examples, drawn from the physical sciences, geodesy, and the reform of weights and measures. Chapter 1 describes the program of dragging the gravitational theory down from the heavens to help quantify representations of 5.

The emphasis falls not on the details of the resultant scheme of imponderable fluids, but on its epistemological and pedagogical status, and on the standards of achievement and precision it helped to impose. Chapter 2 gives illustrations, many of them literal, of representative instrumentation for procuring exact information. Chapter 3 examines the practice of the dominant school in the pur suit of exact physical science around 1800, which took its inspira tion primarily from Laplace. Chapter 4 brings exact science literally to earth in an account of trigonometric surveys undertaken largely for military purposes; the deservedly famous expeditions to deter mine the earth's shape piggybacked on state support of strategic cartographical projects. Chapter 5 rehearses the story of the greatest mobilization of exact science for national purposes that occurred during the 18th century: the design, execution, and implementation of the metric system of weights and measures.</page><page sequence="14">1 THE STANDARD MODEL The physical science of the late 18th century invoked a set of qualitatively different sorts of matters, which served as carriers of special-purpose forces. These matters divided into ordinary or ponderable stuff and weightless fluids, able to act on ponderable matter and, in certain cases, on one another. Ordinary matter car ries, and exerts upon itself, the forces of gravity, cohesion, chemical affinity, and capillarity. Among the imponderables, the particles of light interact with ordinary matter; the fluid(s) of electricity act on ordinary matter and on one another; the fluids of magnetism behave similarly; and the self-repulsive fluid of heat (caloric) counters the various cohesive forces that, without its intervention, would coagulate all terrestrial ponderable matter into one unleavened lump. Borrowing a term from today's physics, we may call this collection of matters the Standard Model of its time. It represented all the physical phenomena known at the end of the 18th century; it had the unity of a common mathematical dress, if not of a coherent ontology; and it was regarded as a model, not as a direct transcription, of God's blueprint for the creation.1 The pattern for the Standard Model was the theory of gravitation and the hints at its extension to other phenomena thrown out by Newton in the Queries to his Opticks. For most of the 18th century, however, the fit between calculation and observation that made the reputation of the gravitational theory could not be duplicated in any branch of experimental physics. Beginning around 1770, the situa tion changed rapidly, as electricity, magnetism, and heat began to yield to the sort of analysis that had ordered the motions of the planets; and just after the turn of the 19th century, the phenomena 1.

These achievements inspired and exemplified the program described by Laplace in 1796 and brought almost to realization (or so he thought) by Gay-Lussac in 1809: to perfect terrestrial physics by the same techniques as Newton had used to perfect celestial mechanics.2 This program had become plausible by the 1790s owing to an increasingly instrumentalist approach to physical theory; to the then recent and remarkable improvement in experimental apparatus and measuring devices; to the availability of accurate measurements of a wide range of physical phenomena; and to the appearance among experimental philosophers of men with talent and training in what the philosophes called the language of Enlightenment. This language, which almost met the usual enlightened criteria of univer sality, naturalness, rationality, and comprehensibility to all but the dullest intellects, was man's ambiguous friend mathematics. Not the rigorous, captiously logical, deadweight mortmain mathematics of the Greeks, however, or the difficult synthetic methods of Newton, but democratic easy-going algebra and creative slip-shod calculus.3 The fruitful application of mathematics to wide reaches of phy sics around 1800 promoted relaxation on both sides. Mathemati cians used what worked, without compulsive attention to rigor. Physicists increased the elements of nature?the several sorts of air, the chemically undecomposable substances, the imponderable fluids?without much concern about the old injunction against mul tiplying essences unnecessarily. 1. THE SCHEME OF IMPONDERABLES The Standard Model of 1800 supposed the existence of ordinary gravitating matter and six, and perhaps more, special weightless fluids. The matter and the fluids carried the forces?of cohesion and 2.

The scheme has not received high praise in retrospect. Addressing the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1900, its president, the mathematical physicist Maurice Levy, identified the doctrine of imponderables of the previous cen tury as the last obstacle to the advance of classical physics. "Physics was then still in limbo, awaiting the savior who would redeem it from the sin of having not yet repudiated the six imponderable fluids."4 Some modern historians have adopted the same unfriendly attitude: the scheme was empty and arbitrary, also unmathematical, misleading, weak, rigid, and wrong.5 Others have more properly regarded it as providing the conceptual apparatus for the quantification of branches of physics previously treated only quali tatively. "How perfect the earth," writes Walt Whitman, "and the minutest thing upon it!/What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect,/The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable fluids perfect."6 Whether positive or negative, the influence of the scheme of imponderables was per vasive: the unquestioned basis of physics at the dominating Ecole poly technique; the inevitable organizing principle of physics texts; and, hence, an obvious demarcator in the historiography of the physical sciences. An epoch in physical science The fashioning of the ingredients of the Standard Model began in earnest in the 1770s. The ultimate causes at play must be referred to whatever brought the quickening of the quantitative spirit in the study of the natural world, which also has been dated Q to the 1770s. Proximate causes may be readily found, however; and among them the discovery of the simple gases, the recognition of latent heat, and the quantification of electrostatic theory deserve attention. 4.

"the most important scientific event of the eighteenth century"?as an epoch for their subject.9 Few would dispute the merit of this periodization, which emphasizes the discovery of dephlogisticated air and the gaseous composition of water, for the history of "chem istry." (The quotation marks call attention to an ambiguous conflation of diachronic and synchronic meanings of the word; some clarification of meaning will be offered later.) Why impose the same periodization on "physics"? There are several good reasons. The discovery of the composition of the atmosphere brought the properties of airs to center stage in the theater of the natural philo sopher. They furnished new material for shows: the philosopher burnt hydrogen to make water, asphyxiated small creatures in phlo gisticated air, demonstrated the eudiometer and electrical pistol to paying customers, and rose in an aereostat to explore the heavens. Looking back, around 1800, Jean-Henri Hassenfratz, who had worked in Lavoisier's laboratory, spoke about the inspirational airs when describing the lectures he proposed to give as the first profes sor of physics at the Ecole poly technique. "At the time of the discovery of gases and aeriform substances, of balloons and their ascension, a ferment broke out in peoples' minds that directed them to the study of physics; some followed their natural bent, others the general fashion, drifting with the crowds."10 A joint symbol of these two paths is the balloon ascent made by J.B. Biot and C.L. Gay-Lussac in 1804. The technique of aerostation had become "easy and simple," and almost safe, owing to the efforts of private entrepreneurs, who sold balloon rides and ring side seats at launches, and the military, which foresaw the use of space platforms in observing the enemy.11 The invention thus developed by fashion and utility was put at the disposal of Biot and Gay-Lussac, two prominent chemist-physicists whom we shall meet later on the ground, by the minister of the interior, the chemist Jean 9.

The aeronauts made measurements of magnetism and electricity in the upper atmosphere, worked a Voltaic pile there, and brought back samples of air from 7000 meters. They learned that air in heaven has the 12 same mixture of oxygen and nitrogen as air in Paris: The gases also served the natural philosopher as a collection of elementary principles. They form the earth's atmosphere, and, as Biot put it, with understandable exaggeration, they constitute in their combinations all liquids and solids. Studied for themselves, they disclosed universal properties of matter freed from the effects of particular affinities, since, according to the Standard Model, the particles of air stand so far apart as not to feel one another's attrac tion. In short, as Biot put it, "the properties of gases lend them selves to studies relevant to almost all the natural sciences." "They are the most fruitfull and comprehensive of all the physical discoveries of the 18th century."14 This point of view recommended inquiry into the behavior of gases when heated?their capacities, densities, and expansions. We need to know how their volumes change with temperature, says Gay-Lussac, in order to develop meteorology, to improve heat engines, and to calculate tables of atmospheric refraction. Many tried their hands at this difficult business, some by analyzing the readings of barometers taken at different heights and temperatures, others by direct measurement by a pressure gauge and a thermome ter enclosed in a heated volume of air. The main lesson learned was modesty. Results ran from an expansion of 1 part in 172 to 1 part in 235 per degree centigrade. Many precautions had to be taken, espe cially to remove unwanted moisture, until the banner year 1802, when Gay-Lussac gave 1:267, which became the definitive value of the age.15 Not least among the benefits of the study of gases around 1800 was schooling in the needs and the means of exact measure ment in physics. Much of the progressive work on the Standard Model centered on the study of the relations between gases and the fluid of heat, or 12.

The cooling of a hot body in the atmosphere bore a close analogy to the rush of a gas from a punctured balloon, excess of temperature being in the first case what excess of pressure was in the second. Therefore, concluded the practiced thermodynamicists Nicolas Clement and C.B. Desormes, after a decade's study of heat and air, "the laws of its [caloric's] motion must be the same as those of gases."16 As a physical agent, caloric performed as a principle of separation, keeping gases gaseous by holding their particles outside the range of affinity. As a concept widely required in physics and chemistry, it acted as the principle of coherence, and even as the anchor, of the Standard Model by maintaining a close analogy between light on the one hand and electricity and magnetism on the other. And, as the element caloric in Lavoisier's chemistry, it tied the physical sciences so closely together as to make "chemistry" and "physics" indistinguishable (or useless as signifiers) within wide areas around their putative boundary. Caloric, a precise form of the old element of fire, came into existence in the 1770s and 1780s, almost in parallel with the classi 17 cal concept of electrical fluid. This point may perhaps best be appreciated in the work of Johan Carl Wilcke, who had collaborated with F.U.T. Aepinus in the 1750s on the design of the air con denser. This device forced the transformation of the electrical atmo spheres into the electrical fluid(s); thereafter, excesses of electrical matter remained on or very near the surfaces of "charged" bodies and not in the air between them, and the ascription of distance 18 forces to the agent of electricity gradually gained acceptance. In keeping with Franklin's ideas, the fluid(s) were free to move in some bodies ("conductors") and not in others ("insulators"), and every body when uncharged had its appropriate supply of electrical matter. After some hesitation, Wilcke adopted the theory of two electrical fluids as set out in 1759 by Robert Symmer. He then accepted the consequences about localization and distance force that Aepinus had derived from the experiments with the air condenser.19 16.

This was the concept of latent heat, which occurred to him as an explanation of the temperature reached by a mixture of equal masses of warm water and melting snow. From his experiments, he knew that this temperature came out less than it would have done had he used ice-cold water rather than melting 20 snow. The difference, he said, represented the heat necessary to constitute water from melting ice. This "latent" heat became undetectable, just like the electrical matter in an uncharged body; heat in excess of this combined heat warms the water and reveals itself to the thermometer just as an electrical charge on an isolated body can be read on an electroscope. Further to the analogy, the fluids of heat and electricity tend to expand, the particles of any single fluid repelling one another and the particles of all the fluids 21 attracting those of common matter. We lack only an analogy to the different electrical capacities of bodies, that is, to the fact that different objects require unequal charges of electrical fluid to affect an electrometer by the same amount. In the early 1780s, Wilcke came across Joseph Black's idea of specific heat, which he appears to have hit on independently a few years earlier. He defined this quantity by calorimetric measure ments and gave values of it, which were not very good, for a dozen 22 substances. Furthermore, and more to the current theme, he emphasized the additional parallel between the theories of heat and electricity that specific heats afforded. Not only did the theories invoke subtle, elastic, and apparently weightless fluids, but also they supposed that each fluid was retained in ponderable bodies by specific forces dependent on the nature of the bodies.23 Lavoisier entered into the same order of ideas around 1772, when he also invented his new theory of combustion.

Like Wilcke, Lavoisier had been surprised that warm water melted less snow than he had anticipated; and, again like Wilcke, the experience had suggested to him that heat can exist in bodies either in a "free" or a "hidden" state.24 Exten sion of this insight to the process of vaporization gave Lavoisier the clue for building his new view of combustion into a full competitor to the prevailing theory of phlogiston. The theory referred the heat and light of burning to the release of phlogiston from the combusti ble. Lavoisier saw that he could supply the heat and light from the air, provided aeriform fluids were understood as compounds of a base with the matter of fire. To help make his new approach plausible, Lavoisier enlisted the help of his younger colleague, the mathematician P.S. de Laplace, in studying the effects of pressure and temperature on evaporation. They aimed to show that the expansiveness of the free heat opposed the weight of the incumbent atmosphere and that the latent heat of evaporation might suffice to account for the heat of combustion. Their results did not see print.26 But in 1781 Lavoisier renewed the collaboration under the inspiration of an account of Wilcke's work, in which he found for the first time the concept of specific heat. To measure this quantity, Laplace devised the tech nique of the ice calorimeter, of which more later. Apparently the main purpose of the measurements was to discover a relationship between the specific heats ease of dilation, and specific gravities of 27 bodies in further service of Lavoisier's new "chemistry." Lavoisier first presented his concept of caloric to the Academy in papers delivered in 1777 and published in 1780. He supposed that the very subtle heat fluid ("fluide igne," "matiere du feu, de la chaleur et de la lumiere") exists everywhere, tends perpetually toward equilibrium, and combines with ordinary matter in various 24.

Aeriform fluids and vapors contain the most fire matter (as we know, they are nothing but some more ordinary material, like water, plus heat); solid bodies and liquids oppose the spread of heat through them by different strengths in accordance with their 28 natures. We see again several analogies to electricity. Lavoisier and Laplace took the parallel further in cooperation with Volta, who passed through Paris as they were beginning their experiments with the ice calorimeter. Together the three tried to find evidence of electrification produced during evaporation?an effect that, if substantiated, might throw light on the origin of lightning as well as on the constitution of vapors. They persuaded themselves that boiling water takes up electrical fluid when vaporizing. They thereby demonstrated "the analogy between electricity and heat" as well as Lavoisier's old idea that "electricity is only a kind of combustion, in which the air furnishes the electrical matter just as.. .it furnishes the matter of fire and light in ordinary combus tion."29 Volta also made much of the "striking analogy by which the science of electricity throws some light upon the theory of heat." He referred particularly to the doctrine of latent heat.30 Lavoisier's great textbook of the new chemistry, published in 1789, opens not with an account of chemical substances and their combinations, but with "the combinations of caloric, and the forma tion of elastic aeriform fluids." Here the analogy with electricity, although not made explicit, was expressed in terms that no informed contemporary could miss. In the single-fluid theory of electricity, unelectrified bodies have no net effect on one another because the attractions between the electrical matter in each upon the ordinary matter in the other cancel the repulsions between the bodies' electrical matters and the bodies' common matters. (In the two-fluid theory, matter-matter repulsion does not occur.) As for a charged isolated body, it remains together and retains its charge by an interplay between the attraction between electrical and ordinary matter, the self-repulsion of electrical fluids, and, in most theories, 28.

In parallel with these ideas, caloric in Lavoisier's theory holds apart the constituent particles of matter against the force of their mutual attraction; it occupies all available interstices; it is the princi ple of repulsion. A moment's consideration shows, however, that caloric and common matter do not suffice to constitute bodies: when enough free caloric has been fixed by a body to render the attrac tion between its particles ineffectual, why do they not fly off to the greatest separation they can attain? Once a body becomes fluid, what prevents it from simultaneously reaching the gaseous state? Lavoisier answered, as did the perceptive electricians who realized that the microscopic forces they assumed could not of themselves retain a macroscopic charge, that the pressure of the atmosphere prevented it.32 The ascription of all these forces, as well as gravitational attrac tion, to caloric, electricity, and common matter did not generate a clear or perhaps even a coherent system. It created a useful system of analogies, however, and maybe more: the quantity of caloric required to liquefy solids and vaporize liquids appeared to be a natural measure of the strength of affinity between material parti cles in various substances and states. "Perhaps," wrote Lavoisier, "some day the precision of the data will be brought so far that the mathematician will be able to calculate at his desk the outcome of any chemical combination, in the same way, so to speak, as he cal culates the motions of celestial bodies." Laplace agreed. "Some experiments already done in this way give reason to hope that one day these laws [of chemical affinity] will be perfectly known; then, by calculation, the physics of terrestrial bodies will be raised to the degree of perfection that the discovery of universal gravity gave to 33 celestial physics." Once again, the case of electricity gave guidance. Aepinus had assumed that the microscopic forces between particles of the electric fluid diminished inversely as some power of the distance, but he had not been able to find the function. Success came to those who 31. Heilbron, Electricity (1979), 379, 396-397, 500. 32. Lavoisier, Elements (1790), 2-4, 7-8, 15-19; cf. Morris, BJHS, 6 (1972), 17, 22, 25-26. 33.

Two testable consequences followed. One, developed by Henry Cavendish in 1771, derived from the theorem that a uniform gravitating shell exerts no force at all on a mass point in the hollow it encloses. Hence a particle of electric fluid within a uniformly charged sphere would experience no attraction from the spherical layers above it and a radial repulsion from all layers below it. If nothing hindered its motion, as would be the case in a conductor, the particle?and all such particles?would rush to the surface. Cavendish showed, in a work he did not publish, that no charge could be found within an electrified sphere. Hence it appeared that the law of electricity was 34 inverse-square. The second, better known, and more influential way to the same result electrified small metal balls and measured the repulsion between them by the twisting of a thread. The essential link to the gravitational theory in these measurements, made by C.A. Coulomb in 1785, was to make the distance between the balls much larger than their radii. In this situation, the effects of "segregation" (induc tion) could be .neglected and, in keeping with the grand theorem of the gravitational theory, the charge on the balls could be supposed to lie entirely at their centers. Coulomb's experiment was afflicted with many sources of errors and difficulties in manipulation. Efforts to duplicate it usually failed. Philosophers outside France at first declined to accept its results as definitive. They began to yield around the turn of the century, just as the new chemistry made its way among them.35 Accepting Coulomb's law often amounted to accepting, as the goal of physics, the search for mathematical rela tionships among microscopic entities. Many natural philosophers came to regard electrostatics based on Coulomb's law as the cyno sure of "art exact theory," from which the phenomena followed by 36 "rigorous calculation." It immediately gave rise to an analogous theory of magnetic interactions, and, as will appear, it inspired fruit ful emulation by theorists of caloric. 34. Heilbron, Electricity (1979), 478-480. 35.

The Model easily accommodated them. Phlogiston disappeared into oxygen, animal magnetism vanished altogether, animal electricity became ordinary electricity, and radiant heat was assimilated to light in a 37 lengthy process described below. Suppositions analogies between the mode of action of the imponderables and other forces of nature also expanded the reach of the Model. There were analogies between counterbalancing electrical fluids and the formation of neu tral salts; between the interactions of the particles of light and the molecules of transparent bodies, on the one hand, and the forces of chemical affinity on the other; and, with the spurious discovery of magnetic effects of ultraviolet light, between the warming of the earth by the sun and the occurrence of natural magnets. "Iron would then have the same relation to the magnetic fluid [in the sun's rays] as pyrophors have for heat and phosphors have for light." Like today's Standard Model, which has made the big bang a household word, the scheme of imponderables and its richness of analogies spread among the bystanders of science around 1800. The last word on the subject was spoken by the first man of his age. "I believe that man is the product of the [imponderable] fluids of the atmosphere, that the brain pumps these fluids and gives life, that the soul is composed of these fluids, and that after death they 39 return to the ether." A world of as-if Acceptance of the scheme of imponderables was eased by the spread of the philosophies of Condorcet and Kant.40 The bottom 37. Infra, ?2.2.

That left plenty to do. "The true business of the philosopher, though not flattering to his vanity, is merely to ascertain, arrange, and condense the facts."41 The scheme of imponderable fluids provided a way to real ize this modest enterprize. Modesty became a prominent ingredient in it, and so of the Standard Model; its practitioners, when in a negative mood, agreed that it could not lay claim to a higher status than a very convenient fiction. The best scheme, according to the leading German physics text of the 1790s, is the one that makes comprehension the easiest, "however far it may be from the truth that we try to approach through its use."42 Some argued that even the parent concepts of the Standard Model were merely useful constructs. Jeremy Bentham arrayed attractions and repulsions in his Theory of fictions as conventional causes of "opposite and mutually balancing effects." The abbe Ha?y, the author of the first French exposition of the Standard Model, goes even further: attraction and repulsion themselves are phenomena, "properly speaking, the velocities with which bodies tend to approach or withdraw from one another." We single them out because, "knowing the law obeyed by this tendency, and apply ing mathematics, we can determine all the other phenomena (faits)."43 The first historian of physics, Johann Carl Fischer, nailed to the doorstep of his immense Physikalisches W?rterbuch the intelli gence that "matter itself is nothing more than a phenomenon and therefore presupposes active causes." We do not know things in themselves, he added, and recommended treating "cohesion" and similar words as expressions concerning phenomena, not causes.44 It 41. Leslie, Diss. (1842), 743.

Fortunately we can do without knowledge of true causes. "Knowledge of laws of nature is worth much more than explanations from hypotheses/' wrote the textbook writer F.A.C. Gren, who liked to say that "only effects are in nature, their laws lie in our minds."45 Although our representations cannot claim truth, we are not alto gether free to feign any hypothesis we wish. Or so Ernst Gottfried Fischer insisted in corrections he added to Gren's Grundriss der Naturlehre to improve its comformity with the Standard Model. We must associate force with matter, says Fischer; that is a "law of our reason.. .a requirement of our power of imagination." We must do so even if we must suppose the existence of a hypothetical matter that does not fall directly under our senses. This condition of know ing requires great care in thinking. "There is no cause for criticism for introducing into scientific books such symbolic hypotheses, whose scientific purpose should be only to link the laws of the phenomena to a model (Bild); but it is censurable to derive from them perceivable and unperceivable consequences without distinc tion, and thus to give to science the appearance of uncertainty and fanaticism (Schw?rmerei)." A matter of heat in principle is most acceptable: "matter is everything in which we imagine mechanical or chemical, in a word, physical forces." But beware. By modeling this heat matter as an expansive fluid, you characterize a non visualizable thing with an image from the visualizable world. "As a symbol such a model may be valid, but not as a source of knowledge."46 This intricate apologetics for the essential heat matter was doc trine among the clear-minded French as well as among German philosophical physicists. The Fischer we have been following wrote a textbook deemed worthy of translation into French by Laplace's energetic disciple Biot. It treated physics at a higher level of 45.

"Without deciding between these two opinions, I will use language comformable to the [material theory], regarding it only as an hypothesis more suitable to aid in comprehending the phenomena, and more convenient for expressing them." In the manner of Fischer, Ha?y insisted on a distinction between palpable and true fluids, on the one hand, and constructs like caloric and the matter(s) of electricity and magnetism, on the other. "We do not place the latter in nature, but only in theory, since they have the advantage when well chosen of representing results faithfully, of offering a satisfactory explanation of them, and even of helping us to predict them; so that if [these theoretical fluids] are not the true agents used by nature to produce the phenomena, they may be regarded as taking their place and being their equivalents."48 It may be useful to have an English example. William Nicholson wrote textbooks of physics and chemistry that became standard in the 1790s. Both teach that the student need not decide the cause of heat; on either hypothesis, he or she could save the phenomena. "The word quantity applied to heat will therefore denote either motion or matter, according to the opinion made use of, and may be used indefinitely without determining which."49 Hard on the stu dent, perhaps, but easy on the conscience of the teacher. So far the writers of textbooks and dictionaries. A similar instru mentalism pervaded the programmatic, if not the substantive, writ ings of the developers of the caloric theory. The Scottish school that invented the concepts of latent and specific heats independent of Wilcke declined to declare the objective existence of the heat material about which they reasoned. The Genevan experts on radi ant heat took the same stand. The Frenchmen who perfected the caloric theory?Lavoisier and Laplace?acknowledged that the 47.

Deluc talked at length with Laplace during his collaboration with Lavoisier on the measurement of heat. "He is one of those with whom I have had the greatest pleasure discussing these matters," Deluc wrote, "for he has no prejudices."51 Lavoisier's Elements of chemistry emphasized the hypothetical character of caloric: "we are not obliged to suppose this to be a real substance, it being sufficient.. .that it be considered as the repulsive cause, whatever that might be, which separates the particles of matter from each other.. .Circumstances take place exactly as if such a repulsion actually existed; and we have a very good right to conclude, that the particles of caloric mutually repel each other."52 This instrumentalism propagated through the French caloricists. Lavoisier's disciple, Armand Seguin, delivered three theories of heat?as motion of ponderable molecules, as a material sui generis, as a compound of light and/or another principle?and advised his readers to take their pick. For himself, he found the second theory the most plausible, and accepted it because it gave a useful unified point of view; but all, he said, were no more than hypotheses, "since it is not possible to demonstrate them rigorously and perhaps it never will be." The representation of the caloric theory at the Ecole polytechnique followed Lavoisier slavishly, from the atmosphere's role in maintaining fluids to the theorist's freedom in choosing models. In his Dictionnaire de physique of 1800, M.J. Bris son chose the caloric theory over the kinetic not for its truth, but as 53 "by far the simplest way to account for the heat of bodies." If the material theory had only convenience in its favor, it might have to yield in whole or part to rival conceptions. Gay-Lussac almost made this view explicit in 1812, when he declared that 50.

In 1828, he justified his continuing adherence to caloric theory solely on the ground that it was better developed than any alternative.54 We leave the last word in this business to the physicist and encyclopedist Georg Wilhelm Muncke, the author of the article on heat, some 600 pages long, in the second edition of of Gehler's Physikalisches W?rterbuch. He offers the truism that we cannot avoid making some hypotheses if we are to reason about natural phenomena. The material theory is the best available. Still, heat exhibits some effects, "which either cannot be referred to a W?rmestoff acting by simple ways definable quantitatively, or can be so only by very forced hypotheses." Therefore, says he, anticipating the escape of the quantum physicist, therefore we must ascribe "many phenomena of heat to the increase and motion of [a W?rmestoff], and others to wave-like vibrations."55 Modesty about the scheme of imponderables was further recom mended by the realization that it could not be set out in a unique form. Physicists could not decide in the exemplar case whether elec tricity came in one fluid or two. "Let's not fight over the two fluids," wrote Georg Lichtenberg to a not-quite enlightened electri cian in 1784. "I declare for neither; in speaking or writing, however.. .1 am always a Franklinist, just as I always write 'deutsch' although I readily concede that 'teusch' is also possible, and perhaps even preferable." Lichtenberg's fellow writer of physics and chemistry texts, F.A.C. Gren, decided similarly, not because he thought he knew the truth, but because Franklin's view agreed better with Newton's rules of philosophizing than dualism. Though devoted to the single-fluid theory, Volta acknowledged that the dualist position could not be faulted for anything more than requir ing two fluids, that is, two hypotheses, where he made do with 56 one.

To them the singlist position had the grave inconvenience of placing on common matter, already sufficiently burdened with distance forces, the addi tional obligation of carrying the attractions and repulsions that they preferred to ascribe to a second electrical fluid. Or, as Ha?y put it, although the case for the existence of two fluids stood on weaker ground than that for electric matter itself, "the adoption of these fluids leads to a simple and plausible way to represent the results of ?57 experience. The other major imponderables suffered from a similar uncer tainty. How many magnetic fluids did theory require? Aepinus said one, Coulomb two. "In my opinion," wrote Fischer the encyclo pedist, "we should not condemn the assumption of either one or two magnetic matters provided that we treat it purely as a scientific fiction, set out as a guide (Regulativ) for experiments and observa tions, but not as the foundation for explanations and hypotheses. For in the last case we would have said nothing more than we already know, namely that there must be something or other that makes the magnet magnetic." Heat and light again presented the question, one matter or two. Fischer judged that most people inclined to believe them identical; but the main textbook writers, including Gren and Fischer himself, treated them under separate articles. Lavoisier had questioned their distinctiveness, but listed 58 them as equally elementary in his table of simple substances. Laplace's close colleague, Claude-Louis Berthollet, saw strong evidence for identity in the parallel between latent heat and absorbed light, both apparently constituents of bodies.59 Radiant heat provided a still stronger analogy. Berthollet commissioned experiments to confirm results reported by William Herschel and William Wollaston, who found, respectively, calorific rays beyond the red end of the spectrum and chemically active ones beyond the violet. The experiments succeeded, as did a demonstration of the polarization of radiant heat.60 Play with ice and mirrors showed 57.

One spoke of "rayons de calorique," "calorique rayonnement," "calorique.. .sous forme rayonnante," and "rayons calorifiques."62 All of which, and other forms besides, easily found accommodation in the Standard Model. 2. BETWEEN CALCULUS AND CHEMISTRY A most significant function of the scheme of imponderables was to help define the subject matter of physics. The large changes in meaning and purview of "physics" during the course of the 18th century have been noticed: they amounted in gross to a shrinking from the traditional coverage of the entire natural world, from ana tomy through zoology, to the inorganic realm accessible to experi ment and amenable to measurement and mathematics. The older usage still occurred occasionally around 1800?for example, in a prize competition in physics for an essay on the nature and uses of the liver offered by the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1792 and 1798?along with a then more recent and less flattering one, deriv ing primarily from the exploitation of electricity in parlor tricks; but to most physiciens, Naturfoscher, and experimental philosophers writing at the end of the 18th century, "physics" meant neither artificial games nor natural history.63 Their problem of definition was to distinguish their subject from chemistry on one side and from mathematics on the other. Johann Christian Polykarp Erxleben required six pages to define his subject in the physics text he first published in 1772; his critical editor, Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, extended this already lengthy declaration to no fewer than 38 pages, in a rendition of his lectures published by one of his students.64 These extravagances betray not physico-chimiques (1811), 2, 186-206, cited in Rosmorduc, Coll.

"If there is a branch of human knowledge that has made rapid progress in the last few years, it is physics."65 So Hassenfratz, in his first lectures at the Ecole polytechnique in 1799; he drew the obvious and self-interested conclusion that he could not recommend any of the older standard texts?Nollet, Desaguliers, or Musschen broek?to his students. Gren felt obliged both as pedagogue and marketer to recast his Grundriss der Naturlehre entirely for its third edition of 1797; he pointed to "the quantity of new views" in circulation since the pre vious edition of 1793. The most important piece of recasting, apart from dropping the earth sciences and astronomy, brought out pri mary features of the Standard Model. Gren now opened with an account of the nature of science as taught by Kant: "it is inexcus able to ignore the insights [Aufkl?rungen] that the critical philosophy has provided here." He moved the section on air to the first part of the text, devoted to the general properties of matter. His reason: the recognition of the* several types of gas and the discovery of their laws of pressure and equilibrium revealed that characteristics previ ously supposed to be peculiar to the atmosphere applied to all pneumatic fluids. As for the phenomena of heat and fire, they now all received attention in a chapter on W?rmestoff. Gren's competitors also self-consciously attended to the arrangement of their texts. "A system of physics [Naturlehre] should not be a dictionary."66 Nor should it be a system of chemistry. But how tell one from the other? Lavoisier had made distinctions difficult. He had transformed "chemistry" from a collection of ill-assorted recipes into, yes, "a system," so wrote the literary executor of the 18th cen tury, "a system that simultaneously opens a new world to the thinker and brings a wonderful simplicity to the infinitely compli cated interrelationship of natural things."67 Lavoisier called himself a physicien (Volta called him fisico e chimico), and advertised his 68 work on combustion as "a revolution in physics and chemistry." 65.

Did "physics" play its part only in Lavoisier's mind, as a model or catalyst to his thinking? Or was it an essential reagent, which, via Lavoisier and his colleagues, precipitated a system of "chemistry" from a mess of empirical recipes?69 Or did it enter firmly into combination, transforming both "chemistry" and "physics," as Lavoisier sup posed, and his younger contemporaries asserted?70 Much of the his toriographical dispute turns on whether "chemistry" existed as an autonomous discipline before Lavoisier, or, otherwise put, whether his revolution took place in or into a science.71 It appears that we need a richer vocabulary. Although partici pants in this discussion recognize that "chemistry" and "physics" in the 18th century designated fields of study that overlap only partly in subject matter and approach with the disciplines that later bore the same names, they have not drawn much profit from their pene tration. The historiographical article on chemistry in the latest gen eral assessment of 18th century "science" provides a particularly good example. As illustrations of the danger of applying 19th century disciplinary boundaries, it gives heat theory, which, it says, belonged in chemistry in the 18th century and to physics later on, and pneumatics, which stayed with chemistry throughout.72 But around 1800, as we know, both pneumatics and heat figured prom inently in physics texts as well as in chemistry texts. There is much that we would call physics in the Annales de chimie and much that we would call chemistry in the Annalen der Physik. The editors of these journals later acknowledged their difficulty: the former became the Annales de chimie et physique in 1816, the latter the 69. The first view seems to be that of Guerlac, HSPS, 7 (1976), 194-196, 267-274, who emphasizes the relationship between Lavoisier and Laplace, and of Donovan, Osiris, 4 (1988), 221-222, 226.

Meanwhile the Journal de physique, de chimie, d'histoire naturelle, et des arts, playing it safe, retained its comprehensive title. Historians would be well advised to use the names of fields of study only as they were used by contemporaries. A history of "phy sics" therefore will include fields subsequently lost to the discipline as well as new ones added by conquest or invention. When it is necessary, as in the last sentence, to invoke the name of a field diachronically, or to compare the state of a discipline at different times, the various meanings can be set off by quotation marks or other orthographic convention. Proceeding thus, we not only can understand, but also write down, that Lavoisier's revolution brought techniques associated primarily with physics into the laboratory practice of chemistry, but not the subordination of "chemistry" to "physics." Let us return to the words of contemporaries. In Lavoisier's, of 1790, "chemistry has been brought much closer than heretofore to physics." In M.A. Pictet's, of 1785: "[chemistry] has become the inescapable aide and companion of physics."73 Encyclopedist Fischer pointed to the discovery of the gas types, the development of caloric theory, and the invention of antiphlogistic chemistry as the forces that brought physics and chemistry together. Hence, says Ha?y, "the true physicist is the one who speaks the language of chemistry."74 An Italian professor writes his correspondent in Lon don for news about "fisica chimica;" a German academician inquires of the same party about "this most interesting part of phy sics," namely, agriculture; textbook-writer Fischer divides theorists into "physiciens mecanistes," who prefer to refer heat to a mode of motion, and "physiciens chimistes," who plunk for caloric.75 Some professed to worry that the trunk of physics, whatever remained after the lopping off of natural history, would be eaten 73.

The popularity of the new chemistry, and its accessibility, did perhaps divert attention when discoveries beckoned, or so, at least, the astronomer J.B.J. Delambre thought. The leading chemist in the generation after Lavoisier, Berthollet, liked to say that physics "was scarcely cultivated in France." He referred to the years around 1800 and offered as a tonic tighter ties 77 to chemistry. The trunk of physics, the surviving physica generalis, contained the doctrine of the general properties of bodies. Usually five such properties received separate attention. Thus the first lesson on phy sics at the Ecole polytechnique took up extension (illustrated by the then new metric measure), impenetrability, mobility, inertia, and gravity. Cohesion occupied a less secure place: a general property of bodies, to be sure, but one closely related to the chemical concept of affinity. Hence the very great interest in capillary phenomena, which appeared to make macroscopic and measurable the differential effects of cohesion and affinity.78 From this point of view, the general part or underlying principles of chemistry could be considered a branch of physics. The course at the Ecole emphasized the theory of affinity over that of any other branch of 79 general physics. The orderly mind inevitably placed capillarity as a species of "chemical attraction" immediately after the obligatory exposition of gravitational action in physique generale. The basic principles of chemistry might therefore be taken up as a link between general and special branches of physics, or in their own right as a piece of physique particuliere.80 The other main division of the old "physics," physica particularis, had been reduced by 1800 primarily to the range of phenomena 76.

Ha?y follows his second chapter, on gravity, cohe sion, and affinity, with ones on caloric, water, air, electricity, magnetism, and light. William Nicholson adopts a similar pattern in his Introduction to natural philosophy of 1790: light, fluids, airs, but then chemistry (including heat) before magnetism and electricity. Fischer's text retains a little more of the ancient scheme of four ele ments: after bodies in general we have chapters on solids (earth!), heat (fire), liquids (water), and gases (air) before a final three on electricity, magnetism, and light.81 In keeping with the instrumen talism of the Standard Model, none of these pedagogues claimed the existence of any of the imponderables. Gren treated "besondere Naturlehre" in much the same order as Fischer, but with slightly greater confidence in the reality of his imponderables. Fischer ven tured that the attribution of the phenomena of heat, light, and elec tricity to special matters is "not without probability." "A certain degree of skepticism is certainly advantageous in science," Gren allowed, "but Pyrrhonism is the death of all true Naturforschung." The concession related to the matter of fire; in treating electricity, Gren admitted that he did not know how many, if any, electrical fluids existed, and offered explanations on both the singlist (which he favored) and dualist hypotheses.82 As physics mixed with chemistry, chemistry mixed with physics. The textbook writers adopted the definition that physics deals with the general, permanent, and macroscopic properties of bodies, chemistry with permanent changes in the intimate relations among molecules. The chemist Thomas Thomson clarifies: physics deals with sensible motions, chemistry with insensible ones.84 Taken literally, the definition awarded all theories of the internal behavior of imponderables to chemistry; Nicholson and others followed out this logic by treating electricity and heat as part of chemistry. But 81. Ha?y, Traite (18062), 1, 446-447, 2, 402; Nicholson, Introduction (17903), 1, 253-314, 2, 1-366; Fischer, Physique mecanique (1806), ix-xvi. Cf. Arnold, AHES, 28 (1983), 250, 263-264. 82.

Nicholson responded to this challenge with the odd compromise mentioned earlier: his physics text discusses heat under chemistry and electricity as an indepen dent imponderable.85 The scheme of organization by imponderables had the disadvan tage, to some minds, of radical incoherence. How do they fit together? How many are there? Jenisch, a literary man, wanted to know the nature of light, electricity, and magnetism. He went to a seminar in physics. "[It seemed to me] an elaborate puppet show, where I admired the astounding effort and subtelty with which the men wanted to examine the secrets of nature, and sadly lamented the obstinacy with which nature preserves her secrets undiscovered and unbetrayed." Similarly, Gehler treated "besondere Naturlehre" as a dumping ground for all the parts of physics that eluded quantification and systernatization.86 But these opinions belonged to a minority, and, in respect of quantification, were in error. One of the most important functions of the scheme of imponderables within the Standard Model was to provide a purchase for the appli cation of mathematics to physique particuliere. The program of quantifying physics was already a bromide when F.K. Achard, a prominent member of the Berlin Academy of Sci ences, announced in 1773 that "everyone now agrees that a physics lacking all connection with mathematics.. .would only be an histori cal amusement, fitter for entertaining the idle than for occupying the mind of a philosopher." "Having [thus] learnt to distinguish knowledge from what has only the appearance of it," added J.A. Deluc, a virtuoso performer on the barometer and hygrometer, "we 87 shall be led to seek for exactness in everything." The sobriquet "matematico fisico," mathematical physicist, made its appearance.88 85. Nicholson, First principles of chemistry (17922), 5-31, provides about the same coverage of heat as Nicholson, Introduction (17903), 2, 73-77, 112-126; and gases are treated similarly in Principles, 47-58, and Introduction, 2, 153-157.

Gradually, some of Achard's colleagues learned to use their numbers to devise and check quantitative theories. Biot named several of them as counter examples to Berthollet's interested claim that few true physicists existed in France: Ha?y's research on crystals, Coulomb's on electri city, Borda's on geodetic instruments, and Laplace's on capillarity.89 They were but the most successful. Still according to Biot, mathematics had been the inspiration for all physical knowledge for a generation. "This exchange of knowledge [lumieres] is the certain proof of the perfection of the sciences." Hassenfratz attributed the great progress in physics he observed around 1800 largely to "a rigorous and almost mathematical method of experimentation," that is, "the scheme [etude] and language of the sciences perfected by the union of geometers and savants who cultivate every branch of 90 knowledge." Applied mathematics, says Jenisch, being a mixture of pure reason and physical laws derived from experience, belongs to physics; further, it is the means by which the 18th century has tried to realize "the general character of its scientific culture, i.e., 'practical application.'" As applications Jenisch had in mind not technology, but mechanics, optics, and astronomy, the old physical 91 branches of applied mathematics. Most prominent German spokesmen for physics around 1800 insisted that in compensation for the loss of its universal coverage of the natural world, physics had a claim to topics previously denominated "applied mathematics." Gehler: "The objects of applied mathematics.. .belong in themselves to physics, and the fact that they cannot be understood without mathematics is no reason to take them away from true Naturlehre." Lichtenberg: "applied mathematics is made up really only of individual parts of physics." Fischer: the new physics consists of "the choicest parts" of applied mathematics, plus, more recently, "the most necessary topics of chemistry;" "mathematics is indispensable for the Naurforscher," a 89.

Gren, who had been brought up in the older, qualitative, inclusive natural science, came to realize the need for retooling to keep his textbooks competitive. "In the last years of his life he devoted himself with the most creditable zeal to the study of mathematics, which cannot be recommended enough [to physicists]." Or early enough. For despite his zeal, "his mathemati cal work showed that he had not completely made himself at home with the rigor of mathematical discourse."93 The Grens no doubt felt menaced by the calculators. People worked up their data to crowds of irrelevant decimals. They corrected their instrument readings far beyond the accuracy of their measurements. The craze afflicted even so unmathematical a head as Alexander von Humboldt's. "It seems that he can hear the grass grow," sneered a collague unimpressed by the great man's doctor ing of instrumental readings beneath the limit of observational accuracy.94 A good example of this compulsion is a study done in 1806 by Biot and Francois Arago on the specific gravities and refrac tive powers of gases. The subject, the forces between common matter and particles of the imponderable fluid light, touched the core of the Standard Model. Biot and Arago worked to six or seven (in)significant figures, corrected in detail for the effects of tempera ture, pressure, and humidity on their instruments, and checked their results by computing one of the best cultivated numbers of their day. This noble figure, "the barometric coefficient," stands in front of the "law" by which the pressure of the atmosphere decreases with height. After many adjustments, they made the coefficient 18334 meters. Their number agreed suspiciously well with the then latest reduc tion of direct measurements to a prodigious formula given by Laplace: 92. Gehler, Wort., s.v.

Laplace's complicated improvement of the formula made it possible to obtain heights with great fidelity with barometers readable to a small frac tion of a ligne (a ligne is 1/12 of an inch). People with a taste for heights and calculation were soon measuring all the mountains they could climb, also church towers, flag poles, and the masts of sailing ships. Reference works of the time, like the Annuaire of the French Bureau des Longitudes, published these heights, which at once advertised and routinized the accomplishments of the "physiciens geometres," the exact experimental physicists, of the early 19th cen . 96 tury. You must know logarithms, as well as like to calculate, to use Laplace's hypsometric formula. Although almost two centuries old in 1800, logarithms had not been applied widely outside astronomy and geodesy. Missionary mathematicians then undertook to spread the blessing. Laplace guessed that a suitable instrument, "simple and cheap," would make their use "extremely popular," and not only in physical science. The assiduous computer who perfected the coefficients in Laplace's formula, the baron Louis Ramond de Carbonnieres, who was also a political scientist, botanist, and geolo gist, wrote rhapsodically about logarithms: "This bareme of learned 95.

"It is to Borda and Coulomb that we owe the renaissance of true physics in France."1 These men, one a naval officer, the other an engineer, and both academicians, had invented ingenious and precise instruments during the 1770s and 1780s and, what was much more, had shown what could be done with them. Coulomb's painstaking investiga tions of torsion in wires and threads led to his famous balance for measuring electric and magnetic forces and for calculating how much his body, electrically considered, disturbed his observations. Coulomb's electrical balance will be described presently, in com pany with other instruments, newly precise around 1800, used to measure the properties of imponderables. First come improvements in Borda's line of invention, precision and practicality in the meas urement of angles. 1. NEW ANGLES ON ANGLES Borda's main contribution to the art of exact measurement stood at the intersection of three trends in 18th-century science. With one of them, the continually increasing prominence of mathematical thinking, we are already sufficiently familiar. Here Borda marched in the van of what his colleagues regarded as true physics. "In all 1. Biot and Rossel, Biographie universelle, 5 (1812), 60, s.v. "Borda," quoted by Frankel, HSPS, 8 (1977), 41; cf. Daumas, in Crombie, Sei. change (1963), 428-429. Biot's coauthor, E.P.E. Rossel, was an expert in nautical astronomy, hydrography, and geography, Borda's main subjects.</page><page sequence="44">36 / SOME MEANS TO THE END his inventions we recognize the mathematical physicist [physicien geometre], who knows how to apply calculation to experiment and to attain the greatest precision by the simplest methods/'2 The second trend was the refinement of angular division, which had proceeded apace for a century, since Jean Picard and his colleagues at the Paris Observatory set the foundations of precision astron omy.3 The third trend was the preoccupation of the maritime powers with finding their way at sea. Astronomy is the most useful of the sciences, said Napoleon, "both to the mind and to com merce." And to other exercises as well. "Spending the night between a beautiful woman and a clear sky, and the day reconciling observations and calculations, seems to me heaven on earth."4 As easy as w Picard's major innovation was to put lenses in the empty pin nules on the alidade or sighting rule of graduated circular sectors. The improvement would not have made an epoch in astronomy, however, had it not been coupled with micrometer eyepieces. The idea of inserting some movable marks in the common focal plane of the objective and ocular of a telescope to measure small angular differences had occurred to several astronomers in Britain and France before the late 1660s, when Picard's colleague, Adrien Auzout, designed a simple and effective arrangement consisting of fixed and movable threads.5 The introduction of instruments of angular measurement containing lenses by French astronomers can be dated precisely. On the day of the summer solstice in 1667, they drew a meridian line at the site of the future Paris Observatory and proceeded to observe using an instrument with pinnules (open sights). Fifteen weeks later, on October 2, Picard took the altitude of the sun for the first time with a quadrant and a sextant furnished 2. Biot and Rossel, Biographie universelle, 5 (1812), 60. 3.

At first he and his colleagues merely inserted lenses in the pinnules of existing instruments; but in 1668 they built a much smaller instrument (the quadrant and sextant had radii of 9.5 feet and 6.0 feet, respectively) to carry a telescope with micrometer.6 In 1679, Robert Hooke installed a zenith sector having a telescope fitted with a micrometer net in his vain search for stellar parallax; by the late 1670s, John Flamsteed's instruments at the Royal Obser vatory in Greenwich bore telescopic sights.7 With Auzout's micrometer, Picard could measure the apparent horizontal diameter of the sun with an accuracy, as determined by modern analysis, of between five and ten seconds of arc. Some three seconds of this error were accidental, that is, arose from errors in reading, while five or more were systematic, the consequences of imperfection in the micrometer screw, of flexure of the mounting of the telescope, and of other fixed features of the instrumentation.8 Picard's accuracy of, say, ten seconds in obtaining the size of the sun was at least six times better than the previous standard. In proof whereof can be cited Gian-Domenico Cassini's rationale for building a very precise meridian line in the great church of San Petronio in Bologna in 1656. According to Cassini, no telescope then existing could be relied upon to determine the diameter of the solar disk to within a minute of arc. Astronomers of the time had a special interest in this quantity. The change in the apparent size of the sun during its annual motion was expected to be about one minute if it obeyed Kepler's laws. Our ball of mud provided further opportunities for the applica tion of Picard's improved astronomical instruments. "We must look in the heavens [he said] for the measure of the earth." He used a ten-foot zenith sector with which he did not do very well, for rea sons easily imagined from a picture of the instrument at work (figure 2.1.1).10 Although the scale could be read to 20 seconds of arc, the insecure mounting of the instrument and the uncomfortable 6.

Retrospective calculations show that his angles were in fact good to 20 seconds.11 Even with his errors in latitude, Picard's geo detic work had an accuracy perhaps 20 to 30 times that of his 12 predecessors. His instruments made possible the realization of the ambitious program of geodetic measurements planned for the early years of the Paris Academy of Sciences as a contribution to the advancement of science and the inventorying of the real estate of 13 the realm. Improvements beyond Picard's came slowly. Two obvious avenues?checking graduation by dividing an entire circle rather than a quadrant or sector and making and mounting instruments more robustly?were opened by Picard's younger colleague Olaus R^mer, but few followed for many decades.14 The best of the situa tion around 1700 may be indicated by the qualities of the 7-foot mural quadrant divided to 5 minutes on the limb (and by transver sals to seconds) by Abraham Sharp, "the first person that cut accu rate and delicate divisions upon astronomical instruments," for Flamsteed in Greenwich. Estimates of its errors range from 11 seconds to over half a minute: Sharp had done his job well, but the quadrant bent under its own weight and when it warmed or cooled its brass limb and iron backing dilated or contracted at different rates. Also, the wall that carried it slowly sank under its weight. By 1715 the wall had descended so far that Flamsteed had to add 14'20" to all observations made with the instrument. With correc tions and inspired adjustments, it provided the information that allowed Newton to develop, and confirm, his theory of the motions of the moon.15 The replacement of Sharp's arc in 1725 by an 8-foot quadrant built by George Graham, a clockmaker trained by Thomas Tom pion, marked an epoch in the perfection of astronomical 11.

Graham set the design and many of the techniques that would be followed by the most successful circle dividers in the world?John Bird, Jeremiah Sisson, and John Troughton?whose work continued his to the end of the century. Graham's rigid trellis mounting probably increased accuracy by a factor of two, to 7 or 8 seconds (on an 8-foot qudrant readable to 5 seconds); and the switch to solid brass construction, also pioneered by English makers, helped to realize another factor of four, bringing the accuracy of determination of angular separations to 1 or 2 seconds of arc, for the very best fixed instruments. The meticulous John Bird, who made several 6-foot and 8-foot quadrants around the middle of the century, engraved the most delicate lines on his creations only in the morning, in the spring or in the fall, with a compass he had set the night before and allowed to come into full thermal equilibrium with the piece under construction. He would allow but one assistant to work with him, lest the combined body heats of several should expand the limb during division.16 Having learned that Bird was over 50 and afflicted so much "with the Gravel.. .that he cannot now bear the motion of a carriage," the director of the Radcliffe Observatory at Oxford urgently petitioned his Vice Chancellor for money to commission two mural quadrants and two sectors from the ill and aging artist. "[He is] the one person living, who is capa ble of making them with that precision and accuracy, on which the 17 goodness of the observations essentially depends. Figure 2.1.2 illustrates his handiwork. Another of Graham's important innovations was to drive division by bisection as far as possible. The trick cannot easily be played in a quadrant graduated in degrees; but it can be carried directly to quarter divisions in one graduated into 96 primary parts. Graham would draw an arc a little longer than a quadrant with a beam com pass and, picking a spot close to one end, would set one point of his compass there without changing its opening. He could then strike off an angle of two-thirds of a quadrant, and, bisecting that, could add the pieces together to construct a right angle. To divide 16.

Two more bisections of the l/96th part created an angle smaller than 15</page><page sequence="50">42 / SOME MEANS TO THE END minutes of arc by almost exactly one minute. Graham also divided his right angle into the conventional 90 parts, subdivided both the 90-part and the 96th-part scales to a twelfth of a part (that is, to 5 minutes of arc), added a vernier, and used one scale to check the other. They never disagreed by more than 5 or 6 seconds, which made an important improvement, a factor of two, over Sharp's very 18 best divisions. Bird extended the principle of successive bisections to the 90 degree scale by beginning with an angle of 85? 20'. After 1024 bisections?it took Bird 52 days at least to graduate a quadrant?he arrived at an angle of 5'. But how construct the original 85? 20? Bird computed the lengths of chords that would subtend angles of 4? 40', 10?20', 15?, 30?, and 42?40' at the center of the quadrant of radius r he had under construction. He made an auxiliary linear scale of great accuracy, readable to one-thousandth of an inch by vernier, with which he could set the opening of his compass to the calcu lated lengths of the chords. He made a 60? angle in Graham's manner, then added 30?, subtracted 15?, and added 10?20', all from the corresponding chords, to generate his 85? 20'. He confirmed the accuracy of the work by adding 4? 40' to obtain the full quadrant and by subtracting 42?40' twice to attain zero. He also inscribed divisions in 96 parts for continual cross-checking in Graham's manner. In another sort of check, the Astronomer Royal, James Bradley, observing in Greenwich, and Tobias Mayer, doing the same in the observatory at the University of G?ttingen, arrived at values of the obliquity of the ecliptic that differed only by two seconds of arc. Both used Bird's instruments.19 The estimates of accuracy so far presented refer to single, abso lute measurements (not small-angle differences) made on quadrants or sextants of 6- to 8-foot radius. Better results could be obtained in special circumstances. A capital example is the 12.5-foot zenith sec tor made by Graham in 1727 for James Bradley. This instrument was to zenith sectors what Graham's Greenwich instrument was to mural quadrants. Firmly pivoted between two walls, the iron tube of the telescope could be displaced by a fine micrometer screw. The mechanism probably permitted accurate measurements of angular 18.

With the help of this sector, Brad ley brought to light the annual aberration of stars (which has a maximum value of 20 seconds) and the nutation of the earth (which 20 has a maximum value of 9.2 seconds and a period of 19 years.) By 1750, the precision astronomy built on the innovations of Picard's group could boast some notable discoveries and, in the best instru ments of English manufacture, an exactness of measurement of close to one second of arc, an improvement by a factor of ten or twenty in some eighty years. This exactness in manufacture became accuracy in observation through protocols developed by Bradley that used zenith sectors, quadrants, and transit instruments as 21 independent cross checks on one another. The next forty years saw a similar change, which, as in many other fields of applied mathematics, accelerated around 1770. The limit of accuracy of an absolute measurement made with the equip 22 ment of classical astronomy is just under a second of arc. The reli able attainment of this limit rested on the introduction of achromatic lenses; on mechanical improvements owing to the diminution of instruments made possible by the new lenses; and, above all, on the replacement of quadrants by full circles. By gra duating over 360?, the maker could check the faithfulness of diametrically opposed marks. The earliest important instruments so divided were the work of Jesse Ramsden, who married into the achromatic Dollond family. He proceeded tediously, by locating approximately the major points of division by compasses and then relocating them under the eyepiece of a micrometer microscope into their correct diametrically opposite positions. It took him 150 days to come full circle. His second major machine in this style, an equa torial completed in 1793 for George Schuckburgh, had a probable error in graduation of 1.5". That would be the case, however, only if Shuckburgh read the scale through one of the six micrometer microscopes with which Ramsden enriched his handiwork. By 20.

Even Bird had had to accept errors of 3". The tedium of Ramsden's method was very much reduced by Edward Troughton, who introduced a gear-driven roller to find the preliminary divisions and tabulated the errors between these divisions and those required by the microscopic inspection of diametrically opposite points. He then calculated where the definitive divisions should go, and managed to put them there, he claimed, in only 13 8-hour working days.23 Ramsden's first full-circle machine was the famous theodolite that entered into operation in 1787 (figure 2.1.3). Commissioned for precise geodetic work, it effectively moved the observatory into the field. With its heavy base plates and sturdy conical struts, it weighed 200 pounds; with its stands, stools, pulleys, and other accoutrements, 400 pounds. Ramsden knew how to protect against the bends of flimsy instruments. The horizontal circle, divided throughout to 15 minutes and readable by micrometer to 1 second, had a diameter of 3 feet. The instrument had a probable error in a single observation of 2 seconds of arc, or under four feet, at 70 miles. Marc Auguste Pictet, a Genevan physist who observed Ramsden's theodolite in action, pronounced it a national treasure; "it is a matter of doubt to me, whether this precious instrument would be allowed to go out of the kingdom."24 Ramsden made a second grand theodolite, divided to 10 minutes of arc, and so sensi tive that a slight breeze, by cooling the limb unequally, could shift 25 the readings of the microscopes differentially. The works of the great English makers from Graham to Ramsden were the envy of the world. In the 1780s, Jean-Dominique Cassini, the fourth of the name to head the Paris Observatory, sought instruments with which to refurbish the family fief. During a cen tury and more, the Cassinis had not been able to raise up French artisans as able as the English. "Ramsden and the Dollonds are geometers and scientists," he said, "our best artisans are only 23. Shuckburgh, PT, 83 (1793), 93-94, 98; Chapman, Dividing the circle (1990), 113-116; cf.

In 1788, the French reluctantly ordered two instruments for the king's astronomers from the ancient English foe.26 They had to wait, until 1803 to be precise. Ramsden took his time and overcommitted his establishment: when the French gave their commission, he had had in hand a meridian transit for the Duke of Saxe-Gotha for five years. The Duke had not sat so idly as Ramsden. When reminders and demands failed, he tried to procure an 8-foot mural quadrant that Bird, then (1786) dead a decade, had made for one Pierre Jacques Onesine Bergeret, who had lent it to the Ecole royale militaire. When Bergeret died, his family put the quadrant up for auction. Several big bidders entered, including the Austrian government of Lombardy (in favor of the Brera Observa tory), the Duke of Saxe-Gotha, and the King of France. The bidding went high. "It is the largest and best astronomical instrument we have," the astronomer Joseph-Jerome Lalande wrote the French minister who put up the money to acquire it. The Duke drove up the price. "The Duke sets the highest price on the possession of this instrument," wrote the Duke's agent to the same minister, pointing out the faithful service that the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha had always rendered the Kingdom of France. The minister decided to retain Bird's masterpiece. The Duke's agent saw to it that the cost of the 27 keeping was very high. Thus the procuring of precision astronomi cal instruments had become a matter of state, and the French received a reminder they did not need that their inferiority to the English in exact instrumentation exposed them to embarrassment if 28 not to jeopardy. A visit of the director of the Paris Observatory and two leading French astronomers to London early in 1788 pro vided a further opportunity to measure the disparity. "They saw 26.

Completing the circle It was Borda's glory to help to arrest the decline that had afflicted France since Picard had led the world in the design of precision instruments. Borda, or rather Borda and one of France's few excel lent instrument makers, Etienne Lenoir, invented a worthy competi tor to Ramsden's theodolite. During the 1770s, Borda improved the navigational instrument then becoming standard, the octant or sex tant, by extending it to a complete circle. The octant, invented in 1731 by an Englishman, John Hadley, requires for successful opera tion that two mirrors, one of them half-silvered, be set exactly per pendicular to the plane of the instrument (figure 2.1.4a). These requirements at first proved too much even for good English mak ers; but gradually they learned the necessary tricks and improved the geometry to the simple layout schematized in figure 2.1.4b. Light from the sun at S at altitude a strikes the mirror M, carried on an arm pivoted at O; when Z.MON = a/2, the ray sent from M to N is reflected to the eye at E. Only half the surface of N is silvered; through the transparent part, the eye looks to the horizon H. The angle a could be read from the scale around O to a minute of arc.30 The point of the exercise was to bring the sun (or a star) to the sea, to allow measurement of its altitude without gazing at it and without the uncertainty of trying to hold the horizon on a pitching ship. In the middle of the 18th century, the calculating astronomer expected to deduce not only latitude but also longitude from sight ings of celestial objects. Tobias Mayer, of G?ttingen, hoped to win a portion of the prize for a method of finding longitude at sea offered by the British Parliament in 1714. By 1754 he had a theory of the moon's motion accurate to about 30 seconds of arc. Could the octants then in use give sightings with corresponding exactness? Mayer, reflecting French opinion, doubted it. He turned out to be wrong. In order to obtain the elements for computation of the 29.

It appears that Hadley may have been inspired by Edmund Halley's remark of 1731, that the main obsta cle to obtaining longitude to within a degree was the want of an inexpensive reliable instrument for measuring the moon's altitude accurately at sea. The first trials of the octant, on which Bradley participated, showed it capable of getting altitude to about one 31 minute?and that with open sights. The major remaining problem after Bird and others added telescopic sights and expanded the octant to a sextant in the late 1750s was financial. Ramsden solved it. Building on earlier ideas for division of arcs by machine, he devised an engine consisting of a carefully graduated circular plate rota table through an angle of 10 minutes by turning a worm gear that engaged some of the 2160 teeth on the plate's circumference. He fixed the item to be gra duated concentrically on the plate; each time the plate advanced, he made a mark on the limb of the work. A scale attached to the mechanism made possible further divisions to 10 seconds. Ramsden had the first of these "dividing engines" in operation in 1767; seven or eight years later he had an improved version, which easily gra duated octants or, because Hadley's instrument by then had expanded by a third, sextants, to an exactness well within a minute of arc and with an expenditure of an hour and a half of time. For this invention, Ramsden received 615 pounds from the Commis sioners of Longitude on condition that he make his method public. In operation, Ramsden's largest sextants had an error of about 6". Even a small instrument, of six-inch radius, could be read to 30" and, with skill, judged to 10" or less. Troughton's 8-inch sextant, turned out with his version of Ramsden's dividing engine, could be read to 5".33 These numbers made enthusiasts. Franz Xaver von 31.

Zach's correspondents used the instru ments on land, to find their latitude. "What can be more striking, convincing, and decisive than your finding [so he wrote a fellow Hadleyan] that the height of the pole at Prague was incorrect!" In Bohemia, a 7-inch sextant of English manufacture did better than a large fixed quadrant. "Amateurs and observers with reflecting sex tants are continually increasing." Zach gave a Russian military officer a 5-inch Dollond sextant and instructions for its use. The officer took it proudly to Petersburg, "the first sextant of this terres trial kind ever in Russia."34 As for Zach himself, he never travelled without a sextant and a chronometer ("a portable observatory"), or returned to his head quarters at his stationary observatory on the Seeberg near Gotha without having fixed anew the latitude and longitude of three or four towns. "Travellers should learn the language of the heavens just as they study the language of the countries they must pass through," advised the geodecist Cassini de Thury, who agreed with Zach in little else; "[latitudes and longitudes are] the most important 35 fruit that can be gathered on a trip."

Now reset the instrument by moving the telescope (to K, say) where the direct and reflected images of L coincide. Then move M to C, where the reflected image of S coincides with the direct image of L. We have AC = 2a. Mayer recommended repeating the procedure a half-dozen times, when, he said, the error arising from incorrect graduation even in an 8-inch circle should sink to under half a 38 minute of arc. Mayer sent a description and model of this device to Britain in 1755 to buttress his application to the Commissioners of Longitude. A sea trial did not reveal that his instrument had any advantage over a standard octant with a large radius. But the captain charged with the test did not follow Mayer's instructions, which were incon venient to attempt on shipboard. Nor did the repetitions around the circle, to minimize the effect of poor engraving, seem very impor tant to the British; that difficulty, according to Bradley, by then the Astronomer Royal, "might be sufficiently removed by the care and exactness with which Mr Bird is known to execute those [instru 39 ments] that he undertakes to make." Perhaps because France had no Bird in hand, Borda could more readily appreciate the possibilities of Mayer's reflector than the Brit ish did. He observed that the greatest inconvenience of the instru ment, and a major source of error, was the need to reset the mirrors to parallel after each measurement; and he pointed out that both blemishes could be removed merely by shortening the telescope. If, as in figure 2.1.7, N terminates before the center of the circle, the reflected image of a star to its left as well as to its right can be received in the eyepiece. That obviates the need to reset. With N at H and M at A, the reflected image of S and the direct image of L coincide in the telescope. Turn the entire instrument to direct the telescope to S; move M to B, to send the reflected image of L to H; twice the arc AB equals the angular separation of L and S. The tele scope can again be directed at L, and M moved so as to bring the image of S to the eyepiece; the instrument rotated to point the tele scope to S; M rotated, to C, to accomplish coincidence; and so on.40 38.

If, however, the two celes tial objects differ markedly in brightness, like the moon and a star, it is better to keep the telescope trained on the dimmer one. Begin by fixing the telescope GH on the star (on the right) and move the ruler EF carrying the large mirror until the image of the moon, M, is received in the telescope. Next, rotate everything around the axis of the telescope, keeping the telescope pointed at the star, until moon and star are again in the plane of the instrument. Then move the rule EF until the images again coincide in the eyepiece. Repeat ad libitum, "until you have done the number you think necessary to obtain an acceptable precision."41 Borda's reflecting repeater did not immediately win the affection of the Navy, but it inspired several French instrument makers to improve its accuracy and reduce its tedium.42 Lenoir had the idea how to bring Borda's repetitive reflector to land. Proceeding in the direction opposite to Mayer, he proposed to replace the mirror system by two telescopes, as indicated in figure 2.1.9a. The upper telescope, M, is free to move; the lower, F, is fixed to the circle and marks 0?. To determine the angle a between two sations, L(eft) and R(ight), point F at R and M at L; clamp M and rotate the circle until M points at R; free M and move it back to spy on L. The angle between the telescopes is now 2a (figure 2.1.9b). Clamp M; move the circle clockwise through 2a until F again faces R, release M and rotate back to L: the angular separa tion of F and M has become 3a. Repeat thirty or forty times, for a total angle A = na. The quantity A/n gives a very nearly, since the averaging diminishes the effect of errors from sighting and the repeated use of the entire limb all but eliminates the effect of slips in graduation. Preliminary trials measuring all angles of a triangle gave a sum that differed from 180? by as little as 1.5 seconds and never by more than 4.5 seconds. The poorest measurements with Ramsden's heavy theodolite closed at just under 3.0 seconds. Both therefore represented a very great advance over earlier instruments, including Mayer's repeater, which seldom produced angles that summed to within 20 seconds of 180?.43 41.

The link was pro posed by Jean-Dominique Cassini, who understood that, as the leader of the English team put it, the theodolite "may be considered as infallible." "Despite that," says Cassini, "we dared to flatter our selves that we had on our side an instrument that yielded nothing in the precision of its results to the English apparatus."46 The French, pointing their repeater from their side of the Channel, found the distance between two flares set out near Dover; the English aimed their theodolite at similar marks near Calais. Unfor tunately time and weather did not permit the full circle of French measurements. The competition reached no formal conclusion. It left the French astronomers with a burden of proof they rushed to shoulder when the Revolution provided them, under the guise of a search for a natural basis for weights and measures, an opportunity to use the repeater on a new triangulation of the Paris meridian.47 The repeater received mixed reviews. John Leslie, professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, whom we shall meet again soon as a measurer of imponderables, dismissed it in his review of the science of 1800. "This instrument, being complex.. .in its construction, and tedious and operose in its application, seems after many trials not to be gaining ground in England. Its chief advantage consists in reducing the errors occasioned by imperfect workmanship, which a more skillful execution might nearly pre clude." Nonetheless, English makers furnished Borda circles, if only for the Continental market. Von Zach ordered one from Troughton in 1795, with which he proposed to do "things more unbelievable" than he could do with a sextant. The circle arrived many months later. It had been worth the wait.

With enough repetitions, a 6-inch circle gave the height of the pole to one second of arc, far better and just as 48 probable as a sextant. And yet in 1809, the officer placed in charge of the triangulation of Thuringia, a project begun under Zach, got poor results with the circle, which he condemned as "inconvenient and unhelpful."49 Similarly, C.R.T. Krayenhoff, who stretched a geodetic net over Holland early in the 19th century, and J.J. Tranchot, who did the same for four new Rhineland depart ments annexed by Napoleon, complained of the heaviness and inconvenience of the larger circles they used, some 16 or 17 inches in diameter. Still, by taking two or three series of ten to twelve measurements, they could make their triangles close to within 2 or 3 seconds, and F.C.F. von M?ffling, an officer who had worked on the triangulation of Thuringia under Zach, claimed that he could always get his to within one second.50 Geodesists adopted the repeating circle not because they liked it, but because they prized accuracy over convenience. Physicists were willing to make the same trade-off. Borda himself may have used his circle to measure angles in his extensive studies of atmospheric refraction. Not a scrap of his results could be found, however, after his death in 1799; and their only memorial was a hollow prism for examining the refractive powers of various gases, which Biot chanced upon in an optician's shop in Paris. On the order of the Academie des Sciences (the first class of the Institut de France) and with the help of Francois Arago, Biot resumed Borda's work. To take angles, they borrowed a repeating circle from the Observatory; the circle's designer, Nicolas Fortin, perhaps the best instrument maker then active in France, also collaborated in the observations. It was a perfect union of the elements, and a symbol of the ideal, of a precise physical science: the example of Borda, whose "happy combination of observation and calculation is so necessary in the exact determinations of physics;" the presence of the specialist mechanic, Fortin, who helped to attain "the last 48.

"We believe that we can flatter ourselves with having achieved a degree of exactness equal to that of astronomical observations, which, in the present state of sci ence, is all that can be required."51 The technique is illustrated in figure 2.1.10, drawn for a gas with index of refraction p less than air's. The direct ray from a distant sight?a lightning rod on the Observatory, 1400 m from the experi mental space?was observed through the fixed telescope of a Borda circle, and the refracted ray through the movable one. The determi nation of the essential angle &lt;f&gt; required the usual manipulations of the circle; and from 0 came the measure of the final angle of refrac tion. The index ? followed from a little algebra applied to the prism angles a, lr e2, and Snel's law of refraction. The results, though expressed to six digits, did not deserve the fanfare with which Biot and Arago presented them. They diverge from modern values by around 2 percent.52 Nonetheless, at the time they helped make the reputation for precision measurement of the Laplacian school of astronomical physics.

Around 1809, Malus obtained the index of refraction of Iceland spar for its ordinary ray with great precision using a goniometer of his invention schematized in figure 2.1.11. Its operation will be clear from its application to determining the angles of a prism. The prism is placed over the center of an ali dade pivoted at O and movable along a graduated scale; initially it points to 0?, and one telescope of a Borda circle receives the light of a signal reflected from BC (figure 2.1.11a). Now turn the alidade clockwise, carrying the prism through an angle ?, at which the reflected light from the face AB traverses the telescope. In this situa tion, the face AB is parallel to the former position of the face BC, and ? equals the supplement of LABC. The measurement can be repeated, "to astronomical exactness," by clamping the alidade and rotating the entire goniometer counter-clockwise until the reflected light from face BC again enters the telescope (figure 2.1.11b); and the whole process can be multiplied ad libitum. With similar but more complicated maneuvers, the physicist can measure the angles of incidence and refraction of light pasing through the prism and thence deduce the index of refraction fx of the crystal. For Iceland spar, Malus obtained, as an average of many trials, the ambitious result [l = 1.6563296.53 In another striking application, Malus determined the separation sq of rays travelling in the principal plane of the crystal. Borda's cir cle fixed the angles as usual and also helped determine sq by the method indicated in figure 2.1.12. The line rp, divided into 100 mil limeters, formed one leg of a right triangle with the hypothenuse rt; tp = 1 cm. The crystal sat with its principal plane precisely perpen dicular to the plane of the triangle, which was maintained horizon tally with the help of a spirit level. Malus moved the triangle until the image of the hypothenuse, as given by the extraordinary ray su, interesected that of the scale, given by the ordinary ray qu: then, as figure 2.1.12 indicates, sq = 0.1 rq, where rq is the scale reading at the place the images intersect. Hence sq is given immediately in tenths of a millimeter, and by visual interpolation to 0.2 mm. This technique also served when the incident ray entered the crystal at 53.

MEASURING IMPONDERABLES In the case of angles, the measured and the measurer came to the same thing: the operator moved an alidade over a graduated circle or rotated a telescope across a marked scale until the angle he made fit the angle to be measured. Similarly lengths, times, and weights were determined by applications of lengths, times, and weights?the intervals between marks on a measuring rod, the number of ticks of a clock, and the multiples of a standard weight. These quantities had further in common that in most natural philosophies at the beginning of the 18th century they applied universally: all bodies had extension, endured in time, and exhibited weight. An</page><page sequence="74">66 / SOME MEANS TO THE END imponderable substance?something that eluded the universal pull of gravity or escaped from the pressure of the terrestrial tour billon?was as incongruous to the Newtonian as to the Cartesian. Measuring an imponderable world seemed an oxymoron. When experimental philosophers decided that some of the most active agents in nature had to be considered imponderable, that is, unweighable, they lost the possibility of determining the quantity of these agents directly by the balance. How to proceed? What charac teristics of imponderable matter should or could be measured? The first attempts were made on magnetism and electricity. The first weightless weighings The difficulty of the problem appears from the Sailings of Newton's immediate disciples, who tried to find the "force" of mag nets before the concept of imponderable matter had been perfected. They gave no prescription for measuring quantity. Instead, they took an individual lodestone as their subject of experiment and, by analogy to the theory of gravitation, tried to find the "law" by which its "force" on a compass needle diminished with increase of the distance between them. No consistent or general results emerged from these efforts because the law depended upon the par ticular circumstances of each experimental setup: the shape of the lodestone, the definition of its poles, the distances involved. The measurers had failed to follow out the analogy to the gravitational theory. They did not suppose that the magnetic substance consisted of particles each acting on one other via the same elementary force (italicized to indicate the primitive, unobservable, attraction or repulsion between elementary particles), or that the observed "force" on this model is the sum of all the forces exerted between all pairs of particles.55 The determination of force did not enable physicists to measure the quantities they needed to describe everyday experiments. Here the notions of quantity and intensity of magnetism and electricity and, what turned out to be a tertium quid, the capacity of bodies for surplus electrical fluid, played the major parts. We shall survey in turn the methods of measuring force and the interrelated quanti ties charge, capacity, and intensity. 55.

The first to take seriously and successfully the requirement that observed "force" should be computed as the integral of ele mentary forces was Charles Augustin Coulomb, then, in 1785, a senior member of the Paris Academy of Sciences. He understood that the only practical way to achieve the required summation was to use a geometry as close as possible to that which made the world system calculable. He worked not with lodestones of irregular shape but with artificial steel magnets two feet (64.97 cm) long, with well-defined poles 5/6 inch (2.25 cm) from either extremity. In this way he could suppose the magnetic fluids in each magnet to be coagulated at two distinct and distant points?the austral fluid at the south pole, the boreal fluid at the north. He suspended one long thin magnet horizontally in the magnetic meridian by a thread attached to its center of gravity; and he placed a second, similar magnet vertically, with its north pole opposite that of the first mag net, and in the same horizontal plane (figure 2.2.1a). The repulsive force occasioned by all the forces exerted between the particles of boreal matter caused the suspended magnet to rotate clockwise as seen from the point of suspension of the thread.

Assume that the elementary force diminishes as the square of the distance and that the geometry allows the approximation that all</page><page sequence="77">SOME MEANS TO THE END / 69 the particles of the fluids in the two poles act as if concentrated at two points. Then the force between the poles may be written as Q/4a2sin20/2, where a is half the length of the suspended magnet and Q stands for the entirely unknown quantities of magnetic fluid at play. Coulomb worked at angles small enough to allow the further approximation sin0 = 0. Consequently he expected to find Q/4a20? = (H+b)Ov Q/4fl202 = H0+fr0, or (2.2.1) a/cj)2 = 00+0, where a and ? are constants of the experiment. Coulomb claimed to find these relations to hold very nearly, and to have measured one characteristic of the suppositious imponderable magnetic fluids, namely, the decrease in the repulsion between their elements with increase in distance.56 Coulomb gave only one set of measurements. The immediate repulsion between the magnets drove the suspended one clockwise 24? out of the magnetic meridian; hence 0X = B\ = 24?. He then twisted the wire of suspension counter-clockwise by 3*360?, which brought the magnet to within 17? of the meridian; hence 02 = 17?, 02 = 1080?+ 17? = 1097?. A further twist through five circles resulted in a deviation of 12?; hence 03 = 12?, 03 = 8-360? + 12? = 2892?.

The apparatus did not work when he opposed unlike poles, since he could not obtain stable equilibrium against their mutual attraction. He therefore had recourse to an indirect method suitable for both attraction and repulsion. He suspended a short magnetized needle in the magnetic meri dian, displaced it from equilibrium, and counted the number n0 of oscillations it made in a minute. He then placed a long magnet vert ically in the plane of the meridian so that one of its poles stood in the needle's horizon. He counted the number of oscillations ni,n2,n3 with the pole of the vertical magnet a distance dlfd2,d3 from the center of the needle. Coulomb chose a thread long and soft enough that he could ignore the effect of its torsion on the motion.

Thus Coulomb gave an alternative measure of the "force" of imponderables in terms of time rather than tor sion, which may have been persuasive to those willing to ignore the difference between 20 and 23. Measurement of electrical force followed the same pattern as the magnetic. At first, failure to follow a strict analogy to the gravita tional theory resulted in several different "laws of force" applicable only to the special experimental circumstances from which they derived. The procedures had this in common, however, that they balanced electricity as well as magnetism against gravity. In the most common arrangement, a pair of threads or straws or gold leaves, charged by connection to an electrified conductor, spread and rose until stopped by the torque exerted by their weight. Because the charge distributes in a complicated way along the leaves, their spread does not give a practical measure of force. In a more favorable geometry, however, the dependence of force on distance can be inferred from a direct comparison between electrical repulsion and weight. The firs! such measurement took place around 1770. It was the work of John Robison, then secretary to Admiral Charles Knowles, who had been sent to Russia to help the Empress Catherine build up her navy. Robison, who had stu died natural philosophy under Joseph Black in Glasgow, soon became acquainted with the Petersburg savants, especially F.U.T. Aepinus, the author of a theory of electricity based rigorously on Newton's concept of "force" as a sum of forces. Aepinus had guessed, but not demonstrated, that the law of force for electricity diminished as the inverse square of the distance between interacting elements.59 In Robison's apparatus (figure 2.2.3a), the repulsion occurs between the brass ball A and the gilded cork ball B, both a fourth of an English inch (0.64 cm) in diameter. The repulsion rotates the waxed silk thread BD in the amber cheek C; the frame AFEL is made of glass to insulate the balls and minimize the effects of induction.

He electrified the pair but not enough to cause their separation against the weight of B. He next rotated the knob I, and hence FE, weakening the action of gravity perpendicu lar to AL, until the balls separated and the angle between AL and the horizon rose to a. (If the balls carried unlike charges, Robison twisted the machine so that BC lay below AL.) Since the diameter</page><page sequence="82">74 / SOME MEANS TO THE END of the balls was small compared with the gap AB, Robison could calculate as if their entire charges rested at their centers and there fore deduce the law of force from the measurement of a and ? and the dimensions of the apparatus. The balance of moments around C (figure 2.2.3b) gives cosy where / signifies the repulsive force between the centers of the balls A and B. To demonstrate the inverse-square law, Robison had to show that AB2sin?/cosY has the same value for several settings of the angle a, on which ?, y, and AB depend. The law of cosines applied to AABC and AALC yields AB2 = a2 + y2 + lay cos(a + ? - 2), where cos 2 = (a2 + y2 - x2)/2ay, and y2 = a2 + x2 + laxcosa, in which a stands for BC = AL, x for CL, and y for AC. The law of sines applied to AABC and the summation of the angles around A yield = sin?(l+K2)1/2, where cosy K = (a ly) sec0 - tan0, and 0 = a + ? + 2. Robison claimed to have made "many hundreds" of these measure ments and to have subjected them to the tedious calculations just outlined, with the spectacular result that the product (sin?/cosy) AB" came out to be a constant for all values of a tried if n = 2.06.

They did not compel assent to the law of squares. Not only did some of the measurements deviate seriously from expectation while others agreed precisely and suspiciously with calculation, but also the apparatus behaved badly. Coulomb observed that unlike a gravity balance, the zero point of the torsion balance could drift during experiments since the thread had a habit of untwisting even when unstressed. Some electricians senior to Coulomb, like J.A. Deluc and Alessandro Volta, who did not believe that Newton's concept of force, provided the key to electrical theory, felt free to reject Coulomb's conclusions or to regard them, as they rightly did most earlier measurements of the "force" of electricity, as peculiar to the experimental arrangement. German electricians disliked it or dismissed it. P.L. Simon of Berlin and G.F. Parrot of Dorpat, who had no strong aversion to Newtonizing electricity, rejected Coulomb's conclusions because they could not obtain consistent measurements with his "all too unsteady twisting machine." E.G. Fischer scandalized Biot by omitting all reference to Coulomb's bal ance from his account of electricity in Physique mecanique.64 The deduction of a law of force from direct balance of electrical against mechanical force presents several technical problems. Robison's gravity method could scarcely have yielded a precise result; therefore, perhaps, he did not bother his readers with his numbers. Nor does the Coulomb balance permit exact and con sistent measurements. Although the calculations can be corrected for leakage of charge, the drifting of the zero point cannot be com pensated without extensive auxiliary investigations. It reflects "elas tic after-effect," a phenomenon discovered in the 1830s during experiments directed toward clearing up the ambiguities and incon sistencies of measurements with the torsion balance.65 Nonetheless, 62.

Their conviction rested partly on his measure ments, partly on the power of analogy (the strengths of electricity and magnetism, like gravity's, diminish with, but remain sensible at, macroscopic distances), and partly on indirect inference from quali tative experiments. This indirect evidence rested on the theory that a uniform gravi tating shell exerts no force on a mass point within it. Applied to the case of electricity, the theory required that all the charge on a spherical conductor (indeed, on any closed conductor) rest at its surface?provided that the elements of the same electrical fluid repel one another in accordance with the law of squares. In 1767 Joseph Priestley reversed this argument. He deduced from the observation that no or little charge could be detected within an almost closed electrified can that the electrical fluid (he was a Unitarian in electri city as well as in religion) obeyed the same law of force as gravitat ing matter. Henry Cavendish demonstrated this null effect by elec trifying a spherical surface, enclosing it within another, connecting them together briefly, and showing that the charge on the inner surface moved entirely to the outer when given the opportunity. The demonstration no doubt would have been persuasive, had it been published in its time.66 Similar arguments offered by Laplace 67 and his coworkers did bring conviction to many. A null method seems especially appropriate to a weightless fluid. Quantity. The Standard Model provided no way to deduce the abso lute quantity of the electrical or magnetic fluids in a body. Relative measurements, however, could be made easily by those able to per form on the torsion balance. In Coulomb's conception, the strength of a magnet indicated the "density" of the fluids at its poles. He could establish relative densities of magnetic needles by hanging them one after another in the plane of the magnetic meridian and twisting the thread of suspension through an angle 6 until each stood at some standard angle 0S to the meridian. Then, according to equation 2.2.1, the densities of the fluids in the poles of the needles 66. Heilbron, Electricity (1979), 464-465, 479-480. 67. Ibid., 495-500.</page><page sequence="90">82 / SOME MEANS TO THE END were proportional to 350s +0. The method required the assumption, which Coulomb thought needed no proof, that the magnetic force acting upon the pole of a magnet was proportional to the density of its magnetic fluid.68 Coulomb faced a more difficult problem in devising a measure of the "density" of electrical matter. Contrary to the fluid locked up in magnetic poles, electrical fluid is free to move in conductors; indeed, to assure that electrical force vanishes within a conductor, the fluid must in general distribute non-uniformly?with unequal density? across its surface. Coulomb needed a way to find relative densities from point to point. He replied with the "proof plane," a thin small disk of gilded paper attached to an insulating handle, which, when touched to an electrified conductor, picked up a charge proportional to the density of the fluid at the point of contact. He attached a number to the relative density at the contact point by the swing &lt;/&gt; of the arm of his torsion balance after he electrified it by a kiss from the proof plane. The technique enabled him to confirm calculations of the distribution of electrical fluid on touching charged spherical conductors. The approximate agreement with measurement pro vided strong indirect support for the law of squares, on which the 69 calculations rested. A richer approach to the measurement of quantity developed from the primitive thread electroscope. By the early 1770s, it had taken the standard form illustrated in figure 2.2.7, the work of Wil liam Henley, a protege of Priestley's. Electricians used Henley's instrument with permanent apparatus, like the prime conductors of electrical machines; it was screwed into a tap on the conductor, which, when charged, caused its index A to move to an angle a from its stem C. Bottled versions of the diverging threads, like Abraham Bennet's gold-leaf electroscope (figure 2.2.8), served in other situations: charge communicated from a body under examina tion to the cap of the instrument spread its leaves to an angle a that 70 measured something about the body's electricity. 68.

Alessandro Volta, who preferred instru ments of Bennet's type with straws in place of gold leaves, went far toward answering the question during the 1780s. He knew that a did not measure directly the quantity of charge, Q, on an insulated conductor communicating with the electroscope since, as he had demonstrated brilliantly in 1778, the magnitude of a depends not only on Q, but also on the shape of the conductor. The demonstra tion: a series of connected metal cylinders (figure 2.2.9), suspended by insulating strings, held a greater quantity of electrical fluid (as estimated roughly by the number of turns of the electrical machine required to charge them or by the shock they delivered when grounded through the body) when hung some distance apart than</page><page sequence="92">84 / SOME MEANS TO THE END FIG. 2.2.8 Bennett's electroscope, 1786.

Not only the geometry of the conduc tor, but also the presence of other conducting bodies in its vicinity, affected what Volta called its "electrical capacity." Rather than measuring quantity of fluid, a indicated something more difficult to visualize, its pressure or, what Volta preferred, its "tension." He guessed that quantity depended linearly on tension as measured by a and that "capacity" was their ratio: Q = CT.71 To demonstrate this relation, Volta required an electrometer that registered equal increments of a for equal increments of charge. He calibrated his bottled straws by giving the electrometer knob a 71.

Volta's way of exploiting the relationship Q = CT in measure ment required the intervention of a mechanical quantity, a, the locum tenens of T, and thus retained the old approach of balancing gravity and electrical repulsion. Nonetheless, the relationship in principle had no mechanical referent: Q and T described the state of 72.

By 1800, physicists had grown familiar with self-referring electrical concepts and hence with a self-contained theory of imponderables. They had also begun to develop a similar quantitative description of the heat fluid. Caloric The analogy between caloric and the electrical fluid(s) in respect of latency and expansivity, and between both and common matter in respect of capacity, developed further under the impulse of measurement. Although a law of force between caloric particles of the form (l/r)n, which many physicists thought might obtain,73 could not be confirmed, temperature and electrical tension, and heat and quantity of electricity, were found to correlate closely. The discovery of radiant heat, which bore no analogy to electricity but a close one with light, made caloric the middle term in the series of parallels that constituted the strongest case for the Standard Model of 1800. Like electricity also, the instruments for measuring caloric were themselves affected by the measurement. Whereas in the Coulomb balance the electricity under study induced charges on the apparatus and the investigator, which in turn exerted forces on the balance, so in the thermometer part of the heat under study was consumed in causing the expansion of the instrument, which consti tuted the measurement. In a still closer analogy, a conscientious stu dent of caloric calibrated his thermometers under glass lest his body heat affect the results.74 Furthermore, the reliability?or linearity?of the instruments were in both cases sources of recurrent and produc tive dispute. Coulomb first demonstrated the linearity of the force of the torsion in his wires without involving electricity; but this advan tage evaporated when later measurers, confronted as he was by elastic after-effect but less willing to ignore it, rejected his apparatus as uncontrollably inaccurate while accepting the main result he drew from it.

The failure came to light in painstaking comparisons of the expansion of mercury with that of gases. The measurement of properties of gases under different regimes of temperature became the most fruitful method for advancing understanding of the character of heat and thence of all imponder ables. Heat thus succeeded electricity as the bellwether weightless fluid. The onset of the succession was noted in 1772 during the ceremony in which Joseph Priestley received the Royal Society's highest recognition for his isolation of "factitious airs." The Society's President, Sir John Pringle, observed that the new field of gases followed naturally on the investigation of electricity as another route to "the nature.. .of the subtle fluids of the univer se."75 He spoke presciently. We shall look at the means of calibrating thermometers, and of measuring the thermal expansion of gases; at the machines used to determine the specific heat capacities of gases and solids; and at the experimental setups for the study and measurement of the proper ties of radiant heat. Thermometry, mercurial and gaseous. A good fixed point for the start of modern thermometry is the work of the committee appointed in 1776 by the Royal Society to determine why its thermometers never agreed. Its membership indicated how widely the problem of heat measurement was implicated in the science of the time: the chair man, Henry Cavendish, represented chemistry and natural philoso phy; the astronomers Nevil Maskelyne and Alexandre Aubert, astronomy and geodesy; William Heberden, medicine; Jean Andre Deluc, meteorology; and Samuel Horsley, mathematicians who liked to calculate. They tried the boiling points of several mercury ther mometers and found them to differ by over 3?. They traced the variation to differences in the placement of the bulb during calibration?whether immersed in the boiling water or exposed to the steam?and to differences in the prevailing atmospheric pres sure.

To obtain agreement at other temperatures, the maker had to graduate accurately the scale against which the mercury level would be read, and the user had to take into account that he generally applied the thermometer at a temperature and pressure different from those at which its scale was inscribed. Cavendish's committee provided tables and graphs of the small corrections they thought necessary to 77 correct for this last and similar circumstances. Many of their pro 78 cedures became standard. While the Cavendish committee steamed its thermometers, Major William Roy, the commander of the Ordnance Survey in Britain, worried about correcting his barometers for the temperatures at which he used them. He could not content himself, in the important matter of choosing high places for fortifications, with the empirical correction to barometric readings devised by Deluc, namely one part in 215 per degree Reaumur above freezing. Roy preferred to meas ure the coefficient of thermal expansion of air directly. As a prelim inary, he examined the boiling points of his best mercury thermom eters and, like the Cavendish committee, found them to differ by over 3?F. Picking one as a standard, he inserted it and a tube of air containing a droplet of mercury as a plug into a long vertical tin can filled with water. He then heated the water with lamps brought up to the can; and, when the water was boiling rapidly, marked where the mercury plug stood in the glass tube. He then drained the water, removed the can, and marked the position of the plug in the tube (whose far end was open to the atmosphere) at 20? intervals as defined by his mercury thermometer. He had previously divided the tube into equal volumes by moving a drop of mercury along it. "Notwithstanding every possible precaution.. .irregularities would occur." Roy ascribed them chiefly to moisture, which gave a large adventitious increase to the measured coefficient of expansion. Nevertheless, he felt confident enough to declare that the expansion of air does not follow precisely that of mercury. For accurate work he preferred a table of expansions at various temperatures derived from his experiments.79 77. Ibid., 834, 843, 854, 856. 78. Middleton, Invention (1969), 71-72. 79.

The individuality of thermometers and the difficulty of removing all moisture com bined with diverse and unequal experimental technique to yield a crop of divergent numbers. Lavoisier and Laplace settled on Deluc's number, e = 1/215 per ?R (1/269 per ?C), which, with their endorsement, claimed some consensus during the 1780s until chal lenged by Guyton de Morveau, who wanted a better value to reduce volumes of gas generated in chemical experiments to volumes at a standard temperature. He asigned the work to an officer in the Corps royal du genie, Prieur du Vernois, whom we shall meet again as a revolutionary politician and metric reformer. Prieur worked for two months on several gases and, according to Guyton, "obtained results free from error and with all the precision desirable." In fact, in his revolutionary way, Prieur had neglected to dry his gases and consequently found that they expanded much more rapidly at high temperatures than at low ones and that the rates differed among the various gases. Nonetheless, his numbers carried the field and persuaded natural philosophers who preferred exact measurement to neat theory that uniform laws of heat might be difficult to deduce from the apparently irregular behavior of 80 gases. Just after the turn of the century a more comfortable view developed under the promptings of theory and practice. On the theoretical side, John Dalton and others who pictured a gas as a set of disconnected particles swimming in a sea of heat fluid inferred that all gases should display the same, presumably simple, mechan ics of caloric. Discrepancies in their coefficients of expansion he ascribed to pesky vapors; and, in the one case in which he took the trouble to dry his gas, air, he obtained e = 1/483?F = 1/268?C over the interval between 55? and 212?.

Later, in 1809, Dalton gave an average of 1/479?F or 1/266?C, remarkably, suspiciously, close to the reigning value obtained by Gay-Lussac in 1802.82 If we credit his stated rationale, Gay-Lussac undertook to find a good value for e because astronomy (in the calculation of atmos pheric refraction), technology (heat engines), physics and chemistry (gas volumes), meteorology (evaporation and humidity), and hyp sometry (the heights of mountains, towers, and balloons) all required one. He filled the flask B (figure 2.2.12a) from a bottle M containing the gas under study (and, also, under pressure, from the water in the bucket QS). Having closed the valve R, Gay-Lussac fitted it with the long tube ID, placed the flask and its accoutre ments in the iron cage EFGH, and immersed the whole in a water bath (figure 2.2.12b). He heated the bath and, at every 10?R, opened the valve via the lever LL worked by strings; gas escaped through the mercury bath KX. When the water boiled, he left the valve open and removed the end of ID from the mercury, to allow the gas in the flask to come to equilibrium with the atmosphere. He then closed the valve, allowed the flask to cool, removed it to a bath of known temperature, opened the valve, and measured the amount of water that entered. He thereby obtained the dilation of the air during the heating and deduced a value of e = 1/267 per degree centigrade. In contrast to Dalton, Gay-Lussac dried his gases and confirmed the result for all of them; without, however, taking 83 into account the expansion of the flask. Later Gay-Lussac showed, or claimed to show, that his e held for all intervals of temperature between freezing and boiling. In these later investigations he used the arrangement of figure 2.2.13: sensi tive thermometers placed vertically and horizontally and a tube 81. Dalton, Manchester Lit. Philos.

This was the mean result of four different methods all of which agreed in the first three decimals. A fifth method, which Regnault could not control, yielded values from 0.3552 to 0.3647.

Further comparative measurements disclosed that gases differ very 86 slightly in their rates of expansion. Gay-Lussac's conclusion about the uniformity of the gaseous state does not hold exactly. That did not prevent it from inspiring the most advanced work in heat meas urement during the heyday of the Standard Model. Gay-Lussac's e was both product and premise of his measure ment, which required the assumption that equal increments of tem perature on a mercury thermometer are proportional to equal increases in the volume of the expanding gas. If 6 denote the read ing of the thermometer and V the corresponding volume of the gas, V2-V1 = V0e(02-01), where VQ indicates the volume at a reference temperature, say 0?C. This equation may be rewritten as V = VQ (1 + ed). Since, according to Boyle's law, pV = constant for any particular sample of gas, or, rather, pV = const.n, where n measures the amount of gas in the sample, the equation pV = const. nT, 2.2.2 where T = 6 + l/e, should describe the behavior of a gas in general. Equation 2.2.2 is known as the law of Gay-Lussac, or of Charles, after the physicist and balloonist Jacques-Alexandre-Cesar Charles, whom Gay-Lussac credited with unpublished experiments that first indicated that all gases might expand equally when heated.87 Charles' law liberated thermometry from dependence on the instrument of its discovery, the mercury thermometer, and other materials unique of their kind. Thenceforth, in principle, physicists could employ interchangeably any representative of an entire state 88 of matter. With this liberation and generalization, the quantitative theory of heat attained a parallel to the measurement of magnetic and electral force. Just as the introduction of a geometry consistent with the Newtonian theory of imponderable fluids gave experi menters a way to deduce properties of force applicable not only to 86.

After the acceptance of Dalton's and Gay-Lussac's results, ther mometricians reversed their approach and tested mercury and other thermometers for agreement with air thermometers. (To escape the vicious circle, the latter were calibrated by marking equal incre ments of volume along their stems, a procedure with some analogy to Volta's calibration of straw electrometers.) One of the earliest precise inquiries in this line was prosecuted, appropriately, by a practitioner of the most exact of the sciences, the astronomer Honore Flaugergues. In 1813, in the service of hypsometry and astronomy (via temperature corrections to estimates of atmospheric refraction), Flaugergues published the results of measurements of e for air from 0? to 80? R (0? to 100?C); "with minute and laborious attention," that is, by meticulously drying his samples, he obtained a value that reproduced his measurements to better than one part in 1000. On this secure base, he found that the mercury thermometer did not dilate equally with equal accessions of heat, but exponen tially, as y = yQ.exp(x/?), where y is the length of the mercury, x the heat (that is, the temperature as determined by an air thermometer), a a constant. To first approximation, y = yQ(l + Hg^)' eHg=*/fl; ^e remaining terms may indicate that logarithms played a greater part in the mind of the measurer than they do in the economy of 89 nature. In the taking of pains, Flaugergues held not a candle to Pierre Louis Dulong, a physician and pharmacist who worked for Laplace's colleague Berthollet, and Alexis-Therese Petit, a prodigy from the Ecole poly technique. In lengthy memoirs published between 1816 and 1818, these compulsive measurers reported their comparisons of the mercury and air thermometers, their determina tions of the relative dilations of mercury, iron, copper, and plati num, and their opinions of Dalton and John Leslie. The last is most easily told. The English, like many others, had confined their meas urements to too small a range of temperatures and too meager an array of materials to support their generalizations; Dulong and Petit 89.

"Neglect[ing] nothing that could contribute to the exactness of the results/' they attained, or so they boasted, "the highest degree of precision compatible with such delicate measurements."90 They compared mercury and air thermometers by heating them together in an oil bath; that of mercury placed vertically with its stem extending beyond the bath; that of air placed horizontally and ending, outside the bath, in a point open to the atmosphere. When the oil reached the temperature 6\, as told by the mercury thermo meter, they sealed the air thermometer and removed it to a mercury trough maintained at d2&lt;61. When the air thermometer had cooled to d2, they broke its point under the mercury, which entered until it had filled the volume vacated by the gas during its heating from 02 to 61. They weighed the mercury that entered (w2, say) and also the amount of mercury that just filled the tube (w{). At both tempera tures the gas filled the same volume at atmospheric pressure; from the law of Gay-Lussac et al. (equation 2.2.2), we deduce that n2/^1 = (7V^2)air/ where the subscript indicates that the tempera ture is that registered by as well as in the gas thermometer. But n2/ni = (Wi-w2)/wi. Hence Dulong and Petit had the ratio (Ti/T2)air independently of the mercury thermometer. Comparison with the readings (T1/T2)Hg showed that, although the scales ran parallel over the usual range, 0? - 100?C, thereafter the mercury thermometer advanced faster than the air thermometer; when 91 quicksilver showed 300?, air indicated only 292?. The question naturally arose whether the exemplary behavior of the mercury thermometer indicated that mercury and glass separately expanded uniformly between the freezing and boiling points of water or only that, when combined into a thermometer, they cancelled one another's irregularities. To answer the question, Dulong and Petit had to measure the absolute dilation of one or the other. They chose mercury. They observed that the question, whether mercury expanded by equal increments of heat, bore not 90.

Their method of pursuing this knowledge was precise and clever.92 The method yielded absolute dilations by obtaining the density of mercury as a function of its temperature. The measurement amounted to finding the height of a column of heated mercury that balanced a similar column maintained at the melting point of ice. In figure 2.2.14a, the reference column stands in the tube AB, which is enclosed by a bucket containing melting ice. The heated column A'B' communicates freely with AB via the pipe BB', maintained rigidly horizontal by the levelled iron frame MN. A'B' rises through the cover of a copper cylinder filled with oil; the cylinder also con tains the mercury thermometer DE and the air thermometer DTi'. The brick structure represents half of the oven in which the cylinder resides. When the furnace heats up, some oil is expelled to the pot Q; some mercury, to the dish L; and some air, to the graduated tube H'K'. The mercury in the tube A'B' rises to the height h' above D and that in AB settles at the height h. Dulong and Petit read the heights through the telescope of figure 2.2.14b, which, in keeping with the other lavish instrumentation, was mounted on a marble 93 slab T resting on a heavy masonry pillar. The columns of mercury in the tubes AB and A'B' must be in hydrostatic equilibrium. The heights of the columns h and h' do not depend, however, upon the lengths of the tubes containing them. That is the capital point of the method: the expansion of A'B' during heating does not menace the measurement. The densities 5 of the mercury in the two columns goes inversely as their volumes, or, since the tubes have the same cross section, as the heights: 5h = h'h'. A little cylinder of mercury in the column AB of volume V would expand to a volume V = V(l + eHg0), where Hg is the average absolute dilation of mercury over the range 0? to 0?. Dulong and Petit determined 0 by the mercury thermometer DE; they weighed 92.

Hence Dulong and Petit also obtained the temperature on the air ther mometer D'E'. In a preliminary experiment, they brought the oil bath almost to a boil leaving the end of the tube H'K' open to the atmosphere. They then plunged K' into a reservoir of mercury. As the oil cooled, the mercury entered the tube. At a subsequent meas urement at a temperature between those of cool and boiling water, Dulong and Petit determined the reading of the air thermometer 0air from the atmospheric pressure p and the height k of the mercury in the tube H'K': the pressure p' in H'K' equals p -dHggk, where g is the acceleration of gravity, and 0air follows from p' and Charles' law. As they remarked, 0air adds nothing to the precision of the experi ment; rather, the experiment afforded another chance to relate 0Hg to 0air.

For example, in 1820 Gay-Lussac, whose measurements had underpinned exact thermometry, joined Dulong and Petit in taking the air thermometer as standard, and employed one that registered 0.06?C/mm over the normal range of temperature.95 Quantity and capacity. As mathematicians know very well, ima ginary quantities may have real measures. Physicists easily absorbed this truth while dealing with the imponderable fluids. An elegant example is calorimetry as practiced by Lavoisier and Laplace. The instrument they invented?the ice calorimeter?had, as they said, the very great advantage that it could produce numbers about heat "independent of every hypothesis about [its] nature." They represented that their primary purpose in proffering their numbers was to introduce the instrument, and to recommend it for its "preci sion and generality," not to declare truths about thermodynamics.96 Nonetheless, their asides favored the (im)material theory. For exam ple, they invoked Lavoisier's conjecture that air supplies both light and heat during combustion (by putting its caloric in play) and they guessed that specific heats should increase with temperature since bodies bind heat (as they might bind a substance) as they expand.97 Lavoisier and Laplace intended their method to supersede the adaptation to specific heats of an earlier technique of finding the temperature of a mixture of hot and cold water. In this adaptation, practiced by Wilcke and Black, the measurer dropped an object heated to a temperature T1 into an equal mass of water at tempera ture T2. Then, if 6 is the equilibrium temperature and co the specific 98 heat of the object, co = (6 - T2)/(T1 - 0). As Lavoisier and Laplace observed, the technique suffered from grave inaccuracy for sub stances with specific heats much different from water's and for all measurements that took any time to come to equilibrium; and it was scarcely applicable to substances that reacted chemically with water or to the heat developed by combustion or respiration. Wilcke had sought to improve the technique by immersing the calorimeter in 95. Gay-Lussac, ACP, 13 (1820), 305. 96.

Lavoisier and Laplace did better. Their calorimeter consisted of a vessel divided into three com partments. The innermost consisted of the wire basket LM (number 3 in figure 2.2.15). They packed the basket containing the specimen and its cover, HG, with crushed ice at the freezing point of water and inserted it into the intermediate chamber bbb (number 1 of figure 2.2.15), also charged with crushed ice. Ice melted by the cool ing of the specimen ran off through the holes in the basket and the lid into the funnel cd, whence, passing through the stop-cock at k, it collected in the jar P. The quantity of run-off, determined by weighing P, measured the heat lost by the specimen in descending from its original temperature to that of melting ice. So far, the scheme resembled Wilcke's. What differentiated it, what made its "principal advantage," was the external envelope aaa, also filled with ice, but separated completely from the experimental space. The melting of ice in the envelope maintained the basket and the inter mediate chamber at the freezing point; its run-off, exiting through the spigot T, could not be confused with the tell-tale drip through k. With this apparatus, Lavoisier and Laplace offered to obtain specific heats "exactly," or, anyway, to within one part in forty, or in sixty, if the day were cold; but, in fact, their fundamental meas urement, of the amount of heat required to melt a unit weight of water, erred by one part in sixteen.100 Some of their numbers for specific heats differ from modern values by 50 per cent.101 With the description of the ice calorimeter and the reporting of specific heats to six insignificant figures, Lavoisier and Laplace gave natural philosophers the goal, but not the means, of precision meas urements of heat phenomena. The ice calorimeter thus played a part analogous to the torsion balance: adherents of the Standard Model accepted it as appropriate in theory but inexact in practice. 99.

But the</page><page sequence="112">104 / SOME MEANS TO THE END discrepancies between measurements made in their way and ones conducted by the old method of mixtures ruined the reputation of the ice calorimeter, which physicists abandoned the more readily on account of its expense. In this they followed J.H. Hassenfratz, who, despite the advantage of having worked with the ice calorimeter under the direct supervision of Lavoisier and Laplace, could not reproduce their results; and, preferring his numbers to theirs, rejected their machine. "It has failed in the hands of everyone who has attempted it since [Lavoisier and Laplace]," ran the gleeful sum 102 mary of the British school. The Index to the Royal Society's Catalogue of scientific papers lists only one item reporting measurements at the ice calorimeter between 1800 and 1870. Its author had apparently missed the news about the water-retentive ice, which he did not mention in his dis 103 cussion of the systematic errors of the instrument. In 1870 Robert Bunsen arranged matters so as to avoid collecting water. An inner chamber filled with ice-cold water and surrounded by ice floating on mercury received the hot object under study. The melting of the ice by the cooling object produced water; the loss of volume conse quent on the contraction of the melted ice was made good by an inflow of mercury, which registered on a sensitive gauge connected with the mercury in the outer chamber. Bunsen calculated the amount of melted ice from the displacement of the mercury. The method is capable of great accuracy.104 With full faith in their calorimeter, Lavoisier and Laplace adapted it to the difficult chore of measuring the specific heats of gases. In order to compensate for the low density of their experimental material, they arranged a continuous flow of gas through the calorimeter. From measurements of the temperature of the gas on entry and exit, the rate of flow, and the quantity of melted ice, they could compute a value for the heat capacity of the specimen under study. In experiments performed during the winter of 1783/4 but not published until 1805, they made the specific heat of oxygen to be 0.65, and the specific heat of air 0.33031 (!), that of an equal weight of water.105 102.

Examining the classic problem of the proportions in which oxygen and hydrogen combine to form water, they found that the reaction stopped before all the hydrogen had disappeared when oxygen was present in excess. The same thing happened even with the proper amount of oxygen if nitrogen also occupied the experi mental space. They supposed that the reaction ceased because the excess gas carried away the heat needed to sustain it; and they con jectured that, because excess oxygen and its substitute nitrogen had about the same effect, the two gases had the same heat capacity. From there the energetic generalizer Gay-Lussac readily sprang to the hypothesis that all gases have the same specific heat.106 His experiments of 1806 were intended to confirm the hypothesis. The compulsion to find a "law" about imponderables, which had been rewarded splendidly in the work of Coulomb and Gay-Lussac himself, now plunged Gay-Lussac into absurdity. He took two identical spherical vessels, one filled with air, the other empty, and allowed the air to expand freely into the void. Alcohol thermome ters disclosed that, in the process, the full vessel cooled by the same amount as the other warmed. Furthermore, AS was exactly propor tional to the denisty (or pressure) in the full vessel before the expansion?exactly, to anyone willing to set 61 = 80 and 34 = 40 (the first of these pairs of figures are 100-AS as measured, the second what proportionality to density required). A similar result to a simi lar approximation held for hydrogen, except that Ad came out larger. Gay-Lussac leapt to another false "law": the specific heats at constant volume of gases under the same pressure and temperature 107 are inversely as their respective densities. In a few years he came to doubt this regularity. In 1812 he replaced it with another, or rather with two.

A little later he reversed, or, better, inverted himself, and found that their specific heats under the same 108 pressure and temperature are as their densities. Investigators as sloppy as Dalton and as scrupulous as Dulong and Petit shared Gay-Lussac's prejudice that simple laws ruled the world of imponderables. Dalton floated many simple relations between the volume and temperature of a gas and the distance between its particles, for example, that temperature is proportional to distance and hence to (volume)1^3. He also fancied that every gas atom at the same temperature had the same capacity for heat, a proposition that did not survive the first exact measurements of the 109 specific heats of gases. Dulong and Petit were luckier in their generalizations. They began a systematic study of the specific heats of metals believing that the specific heat per metal atom ca might indeed be a constant. Then they measured. Heating their metallic specimens slightly above the temperature of the air, they observed the time At each took to cool to its environment; taking cocAf, they obtained specific heats by weight to three significant figures. Now ca = c/n, where n = the number of atoms in a gram of the sub stance under consideration; and n = const./A, A the substance's atomic weight. Measurements on 13 metals gave for c-A values ranging from 0.3685 to 0.3830.

The first trustworthy measurements of specific heats of gases?the measurements that subverted Dalton's guess that ca is the same for all gases?came as a result of a prize competition of 1812 organized by the First Class of the Institut de France.

Without them, "no exact research can be carried out on the amount of heat given out in various chemical reactions." Two sets of "phy sicists" responded: Francois Delaroche, perhaps a medical doctor and certainly a friend of Biot's, and Jacques Etienne Berard, cer tainly a medical doctor and perhaps a friend of Gay-Lussac's, who won the prize; and Nicolas Clement and Charles Bernard Desormes, the latter father-in-law to the former and both industrial chemists, who obtained honorable mention. A secondary purpose of the competition?the first being to measure?was to subvert the schismatic caloric sect, represented in 1812 by Dalton and Leslie, who denied the existence of latent or bound heat. In their view, the heat developed in any process arose owing to alterations in the specific heats of the substances undergoing change; consequently, as will appear, they ascribed a finite specific heat to vacuum. Delaroche and Berard held to the orthodox position of Lavoisier's school; Clement and Desormes betrayed a taint of Dalton's heresy; both sets of investigators obtained excellent values for the specific heats of the common gases.111 The apparatus with which the winners worked is schematized in figure 2.2.16. Number 1 shows the calorimeter AB, a copper vessel containing cold water and a spiral tube about a meter long through which the warm gas under study flows. Delaroche and Berard deduced the relative values of the specific heats from the tempera tures AjT at which the several gases steadily maintained the calorimeter above the ambiant temperature. Number 2 schematizes the system for obtaining an even flow of gas. The vessel B contains the gas, the flask A, water, which initially stands at the level GH.

K represents a stove that sends steam through the long tube FG and out the branch GI; the steam heats the gas almost to 100?C as it passes through DE on its way to the calorimeter L, which dwells in something like thermal isolation from the stove and the experimenters just beyond the wall PQ. An experiment begins with B full of air, B' full of water, and V full of hydrogen; V is empty. The taps a, c, f, and h are open: air flows from B to M, compressing V, which expels its hydrogen through the heating tube DE and into the calorimeter L; whence the hydrogen, having depo sited its heat, flows into V, pressing the air from M' into B', whose water runs out through the drain P'. When all the air has left B and all the hydrogen V, the experimenters (it was good there were two) closed a, c, f, h, and E (see number 2 of figure 2.2.16), and opened P; and also opened g, e, d, b, and E', and closed P', all in the twin kling of an eye (two seconds, to be precise). Thermometers gave the temperature of the gas on entering and leaving the calorimeter. After rendering this description, Delaroche and Berard remembered their readers. "Perhaps you will find the details we have given about our apparatus a little long; but we thought that we ought not omit them because they will help you to appreciate the exactness of our results."113 And that also may be sufficient justification for repeating them here. Let the number of liters of gas passing through the calorimeter in unit time be s (at a standard temperature and pressure), and its drop in temperature during the passage be AT. At equilibrium, the gas delivers enough heat to the water to preserve it at a temperature AR above that of the surrounding air. If the loss of heat of the water to the air is taken to be proportional to AR, then sATcp (the rate of delivery of heat by the gas) equals const. AR. Here cp means specific heat at the constant pressure under which the gas moves; Delaroche and Berard emphasized that the quantity they determined, cp, differed from specific heat taken at constant volume. They conse quently accepted as the relative value of cp at standard pressure and temperature for the several gases they tried cpocAR/sAT. Taking cp 113.

They are good to two or three figures at most, since Delaroche and Berard estimated the tem perature of the gases at entry to the calorimeter only to three figures and corrected the direct effect of the oven on the calorimeter only . . 115 to two. To increase the usefulness of these numbers, Delaroche and Berard found the ratio of the specific heats of air and water. Their apparatus (number 9 of figure 2.2.17) pushed water through the siphon C at a steady drip. The stove R supplied the steam that warmed the water in its passage through the tube EE on its way to the bottom of the calorimeter at G. The branch EF contained three thermometers, as schematized more fully in the blow-up on the left of the figure; their readings allowed an estimate of the rate of cool ing of the water in its travels, and hence of its temperature on entering the calorimeter. It finished its journey dribbling through the capillary point at P, thus making an observable record of its rate of flow. The calculation, which reduced the flow of water to that of air in the earlier experiments, yielded cair = 0.2669 that of an equal mass of water.116 With this equivalence, Delaroche and Berard could develop what they rated a devastating rebuttal of the view that the heat liberated in an exothermic reaction derived from the change in specific heats of the reactants. Take the case of water. Let the weights of hydro gen and oxygen that combine to make a gram of water be a and \-a, and let their specific heats be cH and c0. Hence the difference 114.

The apparatus at the left of figure 2.2.17 (number 8) pictures the hydraulic arrangement for running gases through the calorimeter at pressures above atmospheric. Delaroche and Berard attempted only air, and only at one high pressure; their single result, that the specific heat per unit volume increased with pressure, confirmed the expectation with which they did the experi ment, and misled caloric theorists for a decade. The increase did not keep pace with the increase in density, however, and so did not confirm one of Gay-Lussac's guesses. On this showing, the specific heat per unit weight would decline with rising temperature.118 We shall return to this erroneous conclusion. The experimental work just reviewed required extensive space and what for the time was elaborate apparatus. Delaroche and Berard used the laboratory provided by Laplace and his colleague Berthollet at their adjoining residences at Arcueil near Paris, "where 119 we had.. .every facility we could want." Clement and Desormes were thrown on their own resources, which, fortunately, included their chemical plant. Like their competitors, they had bigger game in view than the measurements solicited by the Institute: they aimed to find the specific heat of space and to locate the absolute zero of temperature. They reached these desiderata via the apparatus depicted in figure 2.2.18. In number 2, which shows the method for obtaining specific heats, the large flask A contains the gas under study, the three-necked vessel I does the measuring, and its companion G allows experiments at pressures other than atmos pheric. A measurement begins (with all taps closed) by pouring hot water in the box holding A. That causes the gas to expand into the space I and to push the liquid it contains (usually oil) up into the tube BC against the pressure in the vessel G. Clement and Desormes took the time needed for the oil to climb between two marks on the graduated tube BC as proportional to the specific heat of the gas; they obtained another measurement of the same quan tity from the time needed for the oil to descend between the marks during the subsequent cooling of the apparatus. Their results, which agreed well with Delaroche and Berard's, were: 118. Delaroche and Berard, AC, 86 (1813), 132-138. 119.

Clement and Desormes pictured air at a pressure p less than atmospheric as a mixture of air at atmospheric pressure p0 and void. They therefore could relate the volume specific heat of the mixture, c, to those of the atmosphere c0 and of space cs, through where the V's indicate the partial volumes of atmospheric air and of space in the mixture. Let n0 and n signify the number of "molecular units" in a unit volume of air at atmospheric pressure p0 and at reduced pressure p, respectively. (A molecular unit?a concept Clement and Desormes do not use explicitly?signifies the volume occupied by a gas particle and its surrounding caloric at pressure Po). Since all measurements were made at the same temperature and volume, p0/p = n0/n. In Clement and Desormes' vision, the gas at p may be drived from that at p0 by replacing ns molecular units by ns "space units," so that n0 = n +ns. From Po/P = (n +ns)/n' ns/n = Vs/Vn = Po/P -1- From the last and first entries for air in the preceding table, p0 = 352, c = 679, and p = 762, c0 = 1000, equation (2.2.3) delivers cs = 403.

In number 1 of figure 2.2.18, Clement and Desormes indicated their method of finding the abso lute heat contained in a void space. Let the vessel AB be filled with air at barometric pressure p0. Hook up an airpump to the tap B and diminish the pressure in AB to p according to the mercury and water gauges LE and GF. Close B and disconnect the pump. The air remaining in AB would occupy a volume V = (p/poWor being the total volume of AB, if under atmospheric pressure. Now open B for a split second?two-fifths of a second to be precise?which instantly heats the gas in AB and restores its pressure to p0. When the gas cools to room temperature, note its pressure p'. And reason thus: the pumping introduced an amount of space Vs equal to Vq-V, i.e., to V0(l -p/po); the instantaneous inrush of air raised the temperature an amount Ad calculable from Gay-Lussac's law, Po/p' = [l + (0o + A0)]/(l + 0O), 0O = 12.5?C being the ambiant temperature, and left a void space V0(l -p'/po). Consequently, the heating represented by AS resulted from the annihilation of a volume of vacuum (who says nihil ex nihilo fit?) expressed by (p' - p)(V0/p0). Clement and Desormes made V0 = 28.4 liters, p0 = 966.5 mm Hg, p = 752.7mm, p'= 762.9mm, AO ="1.3212 degrees exactly." Therefore the annihilation of 0.377 liter of vacuum raised the tem perature 1.32?C; if the entire V0 had perished, it could have raised the temperature of an equal volume of air from 12.5? by (1.32)(28.4)/(3.77) = 99?. Clement and Desormes guessed that this number would have been something closer to 114? if they could have prevented losses of heat to the atmosphere during their meas urement. And this value of 114?, they thought, agreed perfectly with the finding from the theory of the speed of sound (of which much more later) that a compression of ordinary air by 1/116 of its volume raises its temperature 1?. "Couldn't one say that a loss of 116/116 of space, that is, of the entire space, would raise the tem perature of an equal volume of atmospheric air by 116 degrees?"122 121. Ibid., 341-342. 122.

Let x be the absolute temperature corresponding to 0?C; cs(x + 18) is then the absolute heat in a unit volume of nothing at 18 ?C. The heat required to raise a unit volume of atmospheric air by 102? or 102 volumes by 1? is (102)cair. On these understandings, (x+ 18)/(x + 98) = 102/132.24, or x = 252?. Alternatively, the value of cs and the earlier result that at 12.5? an annihilated void can raise an equal volume of air 112? yield (x + 12.5)(400) = (112)(1000), whence x = 267.5. A most wonderful coincidence. And there is more. Gay-Lussac had found that all gases gain 1/266.7 of their volume at freezing for each additional degree centigrade. Reversing the process, a gas would contract to nothing, and hence permit no further cooling, at -266.7?C. The direct method gave 267.5, indirect reasoning from entirely different principles, 266.7. "We confess," the lucky experimenters wrote, "we confess that so singular an agreement is for us a powerful reason to believe in the precision of 123 our conclusion." Two reasons may be offered for dilating on this extraordinary agreement between exact measurement and a theory now (and even then) considered altogether wrong.124 For one, it serves as a re minder that numerical confirmation of theoretical predictions or expectations does not necessarily indicate a fruitful line of thought. Secondly, it suggests how deeply the set of analogies on which the Standard Model rested had settled. The interaction of vacuum and ponderable matter in the theory of Clement and Desormes resem bles that of the two electrical fluids in the standard theory of electri 123.

Then x(l-c^ce) = L; with their own new ly measured value for Cjce, 0.72, and the standard value for L, 75, they obtained x = 267! 124.

Clement and Desormes themselves developed simi lar analogies. Thus, to complete its parallel with magnetism, electri city, and light, caloric must propagate in a space completely void of air. Furthermore, to complete its enrollment in the class of elastic fluids, its laws of motion must be the same as those of gases, tem perature being for the one what pressure is for the other. The anal ogy to gases requires that caloric have mobility and elasticity, exten sion and impenetrability. And much more to the same purpose. Radiant heat. The quantitative characteristics of caloric so far exam ined were inferred from its interactions with matter, especially gases. The inferences required rested on the concepts of latent and specific heat, the expansion of bodies when heated, and the spon taneous flow of heat from warm bodies to cold ones. In none of this did caloric make an appearance apart from ponderable matter. Beginning in fhe 1770s, however, and thus contemporary with the enrichment of heat theory by the notions of latency and specificity, ways were found to study caloric free from matter. In these early investigations, light acted as the companion of heat. Hence investi gators did not have to seek far for conceptual and instrumental apparatus: they adapted the equipment of optics. A standard parlor trick of the time played with heat as if it were light, by reflecting it from two facing metallic mirrors. At the focus of one mirror the demonstrator placed an inflammable object, which burst into flames when he moved a single hot coat into the focus of the other. Since the ignition could be accomplished over a distance of twenty feet or more by a red hot coal, and over as much as twelve feet by a coal not quite warm enough to glow, the demons tration made an impression.126 It also raised to a new urgency the old question of the relationship between heat and light. In order not to prejudice the answer unduly, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who had come to the problem through his interest in gases, fire, and the chemical effects of light, introduced the term "strahlende Hitze," or radiant heat. He showed that radiant heat 125. Desormes and Clement, JP, 89 (1819), 325-328, 336. 126.

Using a coal that did not glow as radia tor, Saussure learned that it could warm a thermometer whose bulb occupied the focus of a mirror twelve feet distant to 8? above the 128 temperature of the surrounding air. The phenomenon prompted two sorts of queries. First, if dark coals could propagate heat, what might cool coals, or cold coals, or ice, accomplish? Second, do the various colors of the solar spectrum have the same or different heat ing power, or carry similar amounts of radiant heat? Taking the second question first, several philosophers of the mid-1770s, not ably the abbe Rochon, directed sections of the prismatic spectrum onto the bulbs of their thermometers. They learned that rays at the yellow to red end of the spectrum had a stronger "calorific effect" than rays at the blue end; and Rochon thought that he had proved 129 that the maximum effect occurred in the yellow-orange. This promising line of research then stagnated while the few students of radiant heat perplexed themselves over the frigorific emanations of ice. The question of the heating power of ice, if any, was posed by a mathematician in Saussure's circle in Geneva, Louis Bertrand, to Marc-Auguste Pictet, who had collaborated with Saussure on the double reflection of calorific rays from dark coals. Pictet answered that ice being cold, and cold being the negation of heat, if ice replaced the coal the thermometer would remain at room tempera ture. The answer satisfied neither Bertrand nor the demands of mathematical continuity. Pressed further, Pictet did the frivolous experiment around 1790 and was nonplussed to discover that the temperature registered by the thermometer sank immediately when he put a chunk of ice in place of the coal. Caught without an expla nation, Pictet concocted one that invoked tensions in the caloric 127.

His friend Pierre Prevost, also of Geneva, invented a better theory: all bodies radiate caloric, warmer bodies more than colder ones; the temperature shown by a thermometer is the net of a dynamic exchange of heat with surrounding objects. To buttress the idea that caloric could fly through space as well as run through bodies, Prevost invoked the obvious analogy to the electric fluid(s), 130 which can burst forth as sparks or flow unperceived in wires. Prevost prefaced the definitive presentation of his theory with the by-then usual disclaimer of truth. "The word caloric was invented to signify the cause of heat, with the intention, formally expressed, of saying nothing about its nature." For himself, Prevost judged the material theory to be the most satisfactory interpretation; it made "a clear and natural language" in contrast to the "obscure and artificial language" of the kinetic approach. Nonetheless, he had no objection to people with different linguistic tastes; "I shall not fight against any system." That understood, let us calculate. Take a and zero to be the heats of two interacting bodies at a time t = o; 1 /p the decrement of heat in the hot body in time dt; 1 /q, the fraction of the radiation of the one received by the other in dt; (q-l)/q, the fraction lost to space. Then, after n intervals dt, the heat YL\ of the body originally hot has become and that of the body originally cold, v pq\ _ ' All this seems a model of a quantitative theory.

To the overly literal mind of Count Rumford, for example, exchanging made no sense whatever. It was, he said, "an operation not only incomprehensible, but apparently impossible, and to which there is nothing to be found analogous, to render it plausible."132 He learned about Prevost's idea, and witnessed Pictet's experiment, during a stay in Edinburgh in 1800, while acting as the Elector of Bavaria's ambassador to Bri tain. He did not have the leisure to subvert Prevost by experiment until 1802, when, marooned again in Munich, he devoted himself to natural philosophy and to a campaign, at a distance, to win the hand of Lavoisier's widow.133 Rumford rejected not only Prevost's exchanges, but also the entire caloric theory, against which he had already discharged the heavy artillery of his famous experiments on the grinding of gun barrels. All this made an extraordinary oppor tunity for Mme Lavoisier. "I think that I shall live to drive caloric off the stage [Rumford wrote his English mistress] as the late M. Lavoisier (the author of caloric) drove away phlogiston. What a singular destiny for the wife of two philosophers!!"134 Rumford did not contest the existence of invisible calorific or frigorific rays similar to light rays. Rather, he felt "the difficulty of explaining how, or by what mechanism, it can be possible for the same body to receive and retain, and reject and drive away, the same kind of substance, at one and the same time." His friend Pictet responded with the apt analogy of the prime conductor of an electrical machine, which, when fully charged, emits as much elec tricical fluid into the air in sparks as it draws from the machine.135 Rumford answered with an experimentum crucis he believed unanswerable. He had invented a thermoscope, which amounted to a differential thermometer (number 2 of figure 2.2.19) consisting of a drop of tinged alcohol free to move under the pressure of opposing columns of air. 132.

Rumford then blackened the face of the vessel that was to receive the hot water, knowing from many previous experi ments that a metallic object emitted heat rays more copiously when darkened or roughened than when shiny or polished. On repeating the experimentum crucis with the hot vessel blackened, he found as he anticipated that the droplet moved; the calorific effect dominated the frigorific, the air in the bulb dilated, and the increased pressure drove the droplet towards the unexposed bulb. Finally Rumford performed with both vessels blackened. The droplet stayed dead center. How could that be explained on Prevost's theory? Should not the blackening of the cold vessel cause it too to send out more calorific rays? And should that not have heated the bulb more, and driven the droplet further, than when only one vessel was black ened?136 Rumford took sound, not light, as the correct parallel to radiant heat. The heat in a body derives from the motions of its particles, supposed to be in constant movement; the radiation of heat occurs through a very subtle springy aether set pulsating by the zigs and zags of material particles. A hot body sends forth rapid pulsations, a cold body slower ones; their radiations differ as high notes differ from low notes. Rumford apparently received initiation into the doctrine of the aether in London around 1800, from Humphry Davy and Thomas Young, assistants at the then new Royal Institu tion, which Rumford had helped to create. Davy taught that radiant heat arose from the jostling of the aether by hot bodies, 136. Rumford, Works (1969), 1, 348-352, 361-363, 371-372, 422-426.

When Rumford was at his most speculative, he supposed that light and radiant heat differed only in the frequency of their pulsations in the aether; we do not see heat because a benevolent deity, saving us from constant stimulation, made our eyes insensitive to it. Despite his rejection of the fluids of light and heat, Rumford did not escape entirely from the lure of the Standard Model. Throwing a sop to the defenders of imponderables, he allowed that "that eminently rarefied and elastic fluid in which heat and light are propagated" 138 might properly be called "fire." Rumford much admired his thermoscope, which taught him that not only blackened surfaces, but also paper, linen, and shellacked metal surfaces, radiate more strongly than shiny ones. He deduced that black skins are advantageous to their possessors in the tropics 139 and that the sensible man wore white clothes in the winter. He took to wearing a very shiny white hat, to preserve the heat in his head. He would have made an odd companion to John Leslie, his overly exact contemporary in heat studies, who used to dye his hair purple. They never met, however, as Rumford was forced to insist. While he was busy publishing the results of the experiments that he had performed in Bavaria during the winter of 1803/4, Leslie's Experimental inquiry into the nature and propagation of heat came from the press. Leslie claimed to have begun his experiments in 1801, and by then to have perfected his chief apparatus, his differential thermometer, which was virtually identical with Rumford's thermoscope. In fact, the instruments had the same ori gin, namely Leslie's differential hygrometer.140 Rumford received his copy of Leslie's work from Joseph Banks, who probably expressed the general judgment of the English scientific establishment in saying that the book "contain[ed] many interesting experiments and much bad reasoning."141 Leslie insisted 137.

He owed his successes (and also many of his failures) to "the superior delicacy" of the differential thermometer shown in number 1 of figure 2.2.20. It differed from Rumford's design in run ning the scale vertically and in using tinted sulphuric acid, rather than alcohol (which Leslie found to lose its color too quickly), for the marker. Number 1 of figure 2.2.20 shows the instrument in ser vice: one bulb stands at the focus of the metallic mirror, the other far enough away to register the temperature of the air; the little canister on the left contains hot or cold water and a thermometer to take its temperature; the screen before the canister cuts off its heat rays when experimental protocol so required. Leslie accepted the rise or fall of the acid droplet in the differential thermometer in unit time as his measure of heating effect. Like Rumford but probably earlier, Leslie discovered that the rate of heating or cooling depends sensitively on the character of the surface of the emitting body.142 Screens of various materials cut off the transmission of heat to varying degrees. How so? Radiant heat cannot be light, as the effect of a glass screen abundantly shows. Whatever comes from the hot body "bears no analogy to the fluids, real or imaginary, of magne tism and electricity," again because screens affected each differently. What then? Radiant heat consists of pulsations in a medium. What medium? "It is merely the ambient AIR." Heat and light are elastic fluids; indeed, "heat is only light in a state of combination," locked in bodies, striving to free itself. When it gains its liberty it goes off like a gas rushing into a vacuum. The equivalence of the two may be demonstrated by the fact that a body warms in proportion to the light it absorbs and fixes.143 142. Leslie, Inquiry (1804), 9-11, 16-17, 21, 24. Cf.

According to Leslie, the amount of heat flowing to G from A in unit time is the variation of temperature at each pulse, hs/r, times the power of each section to absorb heat, das (d is the air's density, a its "specific attraction for heat"), divided by the time of the pulse, s/ev\ viz., hasbeh/r. "Such then is the recondite process, which theory unfolds, of the communication of heat."144 Since the formula contains unknow ables, it could at best be fitted empirically; in fact, it says only that the rate of radiation is proportional to the difference in temperature between the radiation and the environment and, for a cylindrical geometry, inversely proportional to the distance. Leslie's argument may be regarded as a useful indicator of the difficulty felt around 1800 in devising a quantitative theory to fit the ever more precise and multitudinous facts. Many of the multitudinous facts Leslie acquired concerned the effects of the surfaces of the emitters on the total radiant heat received by the differential thermometer. He varied not only their nature, but also their orientation, and so secured the result that not 144. Leslie, Inquiry (1804), 193-200, 201 (quote).</page><page sequence="135">SOME MEANS TO THE END / 127 the total surface, but its orthographic projection, determines the heat conveyed to a fixed detector.145 In this respect, as in many oth ers, radiant heat resembled light. Indeed, despite his independence, Leslie accepted the Standard Model. In his view, light consists of particles whose mutual repellency persists when they are combined in matter; heat is an igneous fluid, composed of mutually repulsive elements, highly elastic and extremely subtle; which, "if it were separately exhibited, would assume a gaseous and expansive form." Although he hedged about the existence of the fluids of electricity and magnetism, he offered no alternatives.146 A set of misinterpreted facts inspired Leslie to take on an author ity much more formidable than Rumford. This was William Her schel, who lived on a King's pension for his discoveries in astron omy. Herschel did not concern himself with the total radiated heat in the manner of Rumford and Leslie, but with the heat associated with the colors of the Newtonian solar spectrum: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. He therefore returned to the problem opened by Rochon and others; not, however, in response to their lead, but because observing the sun brought him in touch with the problem. He literally felt that filters of different colors absorbed different amounts of heat from the sun. To discover which absorbed most, he threw the prismatic colors one at a time onto a thermometer. Preliminary trials indicated that red rays heated more powerfully than violet in the ratio of 3.5:1, and that the heating effect declined monotonically from red to violet. Whence it appeared that "radiant heat, as well as light, whether they be the same or different agents, is not only refrangible, but is also subject to the laws of dispersion arising from its different refrangibility." At this early state of his investigations, he guessed that the maximum of the heating effect might be carried by rays less refrangible than red; "in this case, radiant heat will at least partly, if not chiefly, consist, if I may be permitted the expression, of invisible light; that is to say, of rays arising from the sun, that have such a momentum as to be unfit for vision."147 145.

The prism CD mounted in a window shutter spread the colors from violet to red upon the larger table. The lead ing edge of the smaller table AB bathed in the suppositious invisible heat rays, into which Herschel could advance one or another of the thermometers 1, 2, 3, the others being left as controls. The lines drawn on AB parallel to the long dimension of the visible spectrum allowed easy determination of the distance of the thermometer bulbs from the violet edge. Taking the rate of increase in tempera ture of the irradiated thermometer above that of the air as shown by its fellows as his measure, Herschel definitively fixed the max imum beyond red, in what he called "the invisible thermometric spectrum."148 His mapping of the intensity of this spectrum, as well as of the accompanying visible spectrum (figure 2.2.23), is one of the earliest graphical displays of the relations between measured physical quantities. The abcissa is the distance from the violet edge of the spectrum; ordinates indicate relative intensities of the ther mometric effect in the case of radiant heat and of luminosity as determined elsewhere by Herschel in the case of light.149 This map ping should be regarded as no less a means to the end, and no less an invention, than the instruments used to obtain the measure ments. The study of radiant heat lent itself particularly well to graphing. The question remained whether heat and light derived from the same or different agencies. Herschel demonstrated agreement of light and heat obtained from solar and terrestrial sources on six chief points?both sets of rays suffered reflection, refraction, disper sion, absorption, and scattering, and possessed heating power?and, to round out the Newtonian seven, differed on power of illumina tion.150 Did that make them the same or different? To respond, Her schel examined the relative transmission of the total spectrum of visible light and radiant heat through various sorts of screens using the apparatus of figure 2.2.24.

Herschel found that his many careful measurements of x and y could not be made to agree. Consequently, he ended his inquiry far from where he began it. Heat rays and light rays had to be distinct in nature. Not only did his measurements of transmis sion oppose their identity, so also, now, did common sense: if heat rays also were light, then the physicist would have to defend the "arbitrary and revolting positions" that, with increasing refrangibil ity, heat rays suddenly begin to give a little light (at the extreme red edge of the spectrum); that the power of illumination increases as the heating effect declines; and that this power in its turn falls off, to vanish with the heating effect at the far edge of violet.151 151.

Leslie had found the truth with the help of a photometer of his own design (figure 2.2.25). The eyes of this robotic face are air filled bulbs, one transparent and the other black. The instrument functions much as the differential thermometer: heat rays traversing the transparent eye act as a control; those absorbed by the black eye drive down the liquid in the graduated tube by an amount taken as proportional to the heating. Leslie confirmed that blue, green, yel low, and red had different heating effects, which he measured as proportional to 1:4:9:16; he eschewed the Newtonian spectrum of seven colors as a relic of medieval mysticism, one of the great man's "strange and mortifying errors." Returning to the main target, Leslie claimed that the heating effect stopped dead with illuminating power at the red edge of the spectrum. Herschel's experiment had been contaminated by convection, hot air rising from the red patch on the table and flowing over the thermometer mistakenly thought to be recording the effects of invisible rays. "A more objectionable plan of conducting experiments could scarcely have been dev 152 ised." Later, on realizing that convection currents could scarcely flow up vertically from the table bearing the optical spectrum (figure 2.2.22) and then horizontally to affect the thermometers, Leslie ascribed Herschel's error to failure to take into account the heating effect of diffuse sunlight in the region of invisible rays.153 Leslie's objection rested on a misleading inference from his differential technique as well as on his wish to explode "that par tiality and timid deference, which the glare of paradox and the weight of authority seldom fail to produce on the bulk of men." The misleading inference: his themoscope would show no net absorption of heat if the transparent and the blackened bulbs absorbed the same amount. But glass transparent to visible rays can be opaque in the infra-red. Apparently Leslie made his bulbs of 152.

Consequently his apparatus was perfectly designed to prove what he assumed at the outset, that no invisible heat rays exist. His "instrument of uncommon delicacy," the photometer he had brought to "the limit of perfection," had two blind eyes beyond the red edge of the spectrum.154 The preceding account of the British school of radiant heat exposes an apparently unfettered addiction to modelling. Yet its members felt obliged to do lip service to the positivism of the Stan dard Model. Herschel declared that his subject was "the rays that occasion heat," not heat itself; "nor do I in any respect engage myself to show in what manner they produce heat." Nor would he declare a preference for rays over waves, or vice versa. Rumford proclaimed "the insufficiency of the powers of the human mind to unfold the mysteries of nature" (a proposition he immediately proved at his own expense) and complemented Lavoisier and Laplace for always speaking about caloric "with that modest reserve which characterizes men of superior excellence." As for Leslie, he used his censure of Newton's errors and "hasty conjectures" as an excuse for a lengthy excursus in praise of Hume's doctrine of cause and effect.155 For that he was roundly cudgelled by the Scottish clergy, who almost succeeded in defeating his election to the chair of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh in 1805 on the theory that no one who could not tell cause from effect should be given the care of children.156 Shortly after the Royal Society of London heard Herschel's first paper on heat radiation, its president, Joseph Banks, rightly judged that "the separation of heat from light [was] pregnant with more additions to science" than Herschel's earlier spectacular discovery of the planet Uranus.157 Herschel himself contributed largely to estab lishing his teaching about invisible rays.

Delaroche set out to clear up the facts and Berard, on commission from Berthollet, undertook to extend them. Using the usual experimental set-up?parabolic metallic mirrors as reflectors, an incandescent body at the focus of one mirror as radia tor, and a thermometer at the focus of the other as the detector? Delaroche defined the thermometer's rise in temperature AS in time At as the measure of the "thermometric effect" of radiant heat. He established, among much else, that the transmission through a glass plate of the heating power of light increased with the temperature and luminosity of the radiator; also, that passage of the rays through a second plate cut down their heating effect much less than did the first passage. "If caloric is a fluid, this fluid is far from being composed of homogeneous parts." But that only strengthened its analogy to light. "Who will be able to prevent himself from seing in this phenomenon a rather powerful argument to add to those that have led some physicists to regard caloric as a simple modification of light or, rather, light as a special state of caloric?" To develop further the analogy between heat and light, Berard and Malus tried to polarize the rays of radiant heat. Malus died during the investigation. Berard persevered, using a heliostat designed by his late partner. Results: the maximum heating occurs just at, but not beyond, the red end of the spectrum, and heat rays, like "luminous molecules," can be polarized by reflection. Berthol let, Biot, and the chemist Jean-Antoine Chaptal reviewed the findings of Delaroche and Berard for the Academy. Delaroche's, they said, pointed to "a gradual and progressive transition between caloric and light;" Berard's suggested further that heat rays, like light rays, have different refrangibilities and that we do not see them only because they do not stimulate our eyes. In all this they were perfectly right. Still, the positivism associated with the Stan dard Model required a disclaimer. Berard had not declared himself for any hypothesis about the nature of radiant heat. Berthollet et al.: "We can only approve the wise reserve in which M. Berard has enclosed himself by not rushing to decide questions about which experiment has not yet made a definitive pronouncement."159 158. Delaroche, JP, 75 (1812), 202, 205, 214-215 (quote). 159.

Then the thermometer's rate of loss of heat to the air equalled its rate of gain from the radiator. He tabulated E against the difference D between the temperature of the radiator T and that of the focal thermometer when the thermometer became stationary for several values of T. The display of numbers did not make clear the strength of the effect?the fast rise of E with increase in D. Delaroche there fore had recourse to graphs (figure 2.2.26), on which the letters indicate the numerical entries in the opaque table: thus the ordinate bb gives the value of E corresponding to a value Ab for D. The graph has the advantage over Herschel's of suggesting a simple functional relationship between E and D, and supports the sugges tion that the beginnings of the graphical display of experimental data should be located in the study of imponderables.160 h FIG. 2.2.26 Delaroche's plot of ?, the difference between the temperature of the focal thermometer and that of the air, against D, the difference between the temperature of the radiator and that of the focal thermometer in the steady state.

In general, he supposed, a proper cooling law would replace Ad with (A6)n. Following up a suggestion by Biot, he had placed some ice chips at the focus of one mirror and measured their rate of heating without a warm body in the focus of the other. He then brought up the warm body, a copper ingot, first at a temperature of 960 ?C, then at 427?C. If the "thermometric effect" were proportional to the difference in temperature between the warm body and the ice, the net rate of melting of the ice (the observed melting less the effects of conduction and convection) should have been as 960:427, that is, as 2.25:1. In fact, in two tries he obtained 5.22:1 and 4.61:1; the rate of loss of heat by radiation went more like (AS)2 than (A0). In this conclusion and reasoning Delaroche did not agree with Leslie, who had arived at the following expression for a body cool ing in air: where h is the temperature ("the height of the thermometer") over the ambient medium, a characterizes the surface of the hot body regarded as a radiator, and p is a constant. The term (a + h) represents loss of heat by pulsation of the hot surface against the air, which was Leslie's model of radiation; the term ph lumped con vection and conduction. The expression integrates to dh = -(a +h)hpdt, 1 i H i v 7 lo&amp;Y' s a+H a+h where H is the original height of the thermometer. A touter of 161. Cf. Grigull, Physis, 20 (1978), 213-235. 162.

His for mula may be reconciled superficially with Delaroche's by interpret ing the term in A82 as radiation loss. But that would not agree with Leslie's physical interpretation. The problem of distinguishing the contributions of radiation, con duction, and convection to heat loss eluded the physical theory of the time. The best that could be done by the best measurers was to seek to find AQ/At for radiation empirically, by examining a hot body maintained in an evacuated space. The best measurers, Dulong and Petit, confirmed that the rate depended on the nature of the surface but not on shape or volume. From observation of the drop in temperature 6 of a hot thermometer radiating into a void bounded by walls at temperature r, they deduced the empirical for mula dS I dt = m(a6 - a7). Here m is a constant characterizing the object under study and a = 1.0075 is a universal constant, at least as judged by comparisons between air and mercury thermometers. Dulong and Petit observed that their formula, "representing] rigorously the progress of cooling in a void, at all temperatures and for all bodies," reduced to Newton's for small values of 6 -r.164 They also offered an empirical formula for cooling in a gas-filled enclosure.

French savants who cleaved to the watch word of Wall Street in the years around 1800 found their fortunes enhanced beyond their fondest fantasies. Selling high meant leaving posts in abolished institutions gracefully and, perhaps, withdrawing from Paris; buying low meant entering new institutions as quickly as their longevity seemed assured, or, best of all, clutching fast to Napoleon's coat tails when, as a mere general, he began to patron ize science. The adroit investor might find himself repossessed of the same portfolio?or, to speak plainly, returned to his old position, suitably increased in value?when an institution closed by the Revo lution reopened with new flourishes during the Empire. Such an institution was the Paris Academy of Sciences, suppressed in 1793 and resurrected two years later as the First Class of the Institut de France; its members, who suffered humiliation and an occasional decapitation under the Convention, received from Napoleon the right to wear a special dark green coat embroidered in yellow lace.1 The caparisoned academician stood at the top of the institutions for science and near science of the Napoleonic era. Members of the First Class had a significant say in appointments of teachers to the higher civil and military schools and of officials to government technical bureaus like the Observatory, the Bureau des longitudes, and the Museum of Natural History. They themselves held many of the senior appointments in these institutions. To complete the chain, the most successful of the proteges would enter the First Class, whence, with the help of others at lower ranks, they would identify candidates for patronage among the best students in the higher 1.

The main feeder in the system was the Ecole polytech nique; the main filter, ability at mathematics; the great patrons, the mathematicians Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Gaspard Monge, and Pierre Simon Laplace, and the chemist Claude-Louis Berthollet. Berthollet and Laplace occupied a special place in the patronage system of Napoleonic science. Berthollet (R.A.S., 1780, M.F.C., 1795)2 had served in Napoleon's immediate entourage during the Egyptian campaign and taught him chemistry in off-hours and in Italian (as a native of Savoy, Berthollet's mother tongue, like Napoleon's, was a version of Italian); Napoleon named Berthollet a Senator, a position that brought some responsibility and the wherewithal to establish a private research laboratory at his country house in Arcueil just outside Paris. Laplace (R.A.S, 1773, M.F.C., 1795), also a Napoleonic favorite (as an examiner at the Ecole mili taire in 1785 he had had the foresight to pass the future general) and likewise a Senator, bought a property adjoining Berthollet's and added his support to the laboratory.3 Laplace and Berthollet gave scientific direction as well as career opportunities to their proteges. "The subject of all our studies was indicated in their works; their conversation and advice gave us the means of pursuing and con cluding our researches."4 They thus reproduced on the intellectual level the union between experimental chemistry and mathematical physics that brought them together on the societal and professional level. Laplace and Berthollet furthered their collaboration by setting up a private club, the Societe d'Arcueil, so named after the location of their adjoining houses, and by basing their research program on a very few principles of physics and rules of procedure. The Society maintained its doctrine by the strength of small numbers?its total membership during its decade or so of activity was fifteen?and by the dependence of its junior members on their seniors.5 We shall 2.

THE SPIRIT OF ARCUEIL The school tie The intellectual unity of the circle around Berthollet and Laplace rested on the conviction that the phenomena studied by physical science could be mastered by mathematics if it were assumed that the particles of matter and of imponderable fluids interact only by distance forces. The conviction had as support some of Newton's queries; the great power of the gravitational theory; the then recent successes of Coulomb's approach to electricity and magnetism; apparently quantifiable chemical affinities; and Laplace's assurances. As early as 1783, in his collaboration with Lavoisier on calorimetric measurements, Laplace had expressed the belief that refraction, capillarity, cohesion, crystalline properties, and chemical reactions arose from attractive forces identical in essence with the force of gravitation. He repeated the conjecture in 1796, in the first volume of his Exposition du Systeme du monde, where, as we know, he expressed confidence that physics could be brought to the state of perfection to which the theory of gravity had raised celestial mechanics.6 The doctrine of reduction to distance forces was more than the goal of Laplacian physics: it was also its definition. On this under standing, apparently conflicting statements by members of Laplace's group about the epistemological status of their work may be har monized. Laplace himself often spoke as if he believed in the physi cal reality of his distance forces; in the declaration with which the Societe d'Arcueil brought itself to public atention in 1807, we read that "progress in physics has the purpose of attaining to the true causes of phenomena," and that the method of the Society, that is, precision, comparison, and criticism, could "lead to unshakeable theories, to uncontestable truths." But Laplace also taught that 6. Lavoisier and Laplace, MAS, 1780, 355-408 (Laplace, Oeuvres (1878), 10, 149 200); Laplace, quoted by Fox, DSB, 15, 358-360, and HSPS, 4 (1974), 95; supra, ?1.1. 7.

Experience may confirm the ideas, but they do not therefore become true: the very simplicity of the laws of mechanics alerts us to their fundamentally subjective character. The only way to penetrate deeper is to generalize laws mathematically, thus removing some contingency at the price, perhaps, of unmanageable complexity.8 The principal applications of the doctrine of forces made by Laplace and his associates jum bled simplifying physical assumptions with attempts at generaliza tions; but in no case would any particular solution warrant any higher presumption of truth than that of meeting the definition of true physics, that is, of invoking distance forces. A similar attitude may be extracted from the writings of Laplace's proteges. Biot (Ecole polytechnique,9 1794, M.F.C., 1803), who wrote the textbook of Laplacian physics, laid it down that imponderables were no more than "convenient hypotheses, to which physicists are careful not to attach any idea of reality;" and he took many opportunities to claim ignorance of the true causes of physical phenomena.10 Yet in his work on optics he wrote that Newton had proved that refraction derives from an attractive force between matter and particles of light, sensible only at short dis tances ("and, in that, altogether analogous to chemical affinities"); that he, Biot, had demonstrated that double refraction involves a force that puts a torque on light particles by an amount that depends upon their colors ("the theory enlightens us about the true cause," "the principles [are] simple and infallible"); and that no more can be known about physics than the doctrine of forces pro vides ("the highest goal to which human science can attain.")11 Gay-Lussac (Ecole polytechnique, 1797, M.F.C. 1806) is said to have been as much a positivist as Comte.12 To be sure, he often 8.

Hence his attraction to gases, whose "simple and regular laws," in respect of dilation by heat and combination by volumes, he uncovered and established without explicit reliance on molecular models. Hence also his artful mixture of modesty, self-protection, and self-assertion: "I believe that I should stress again that I present these consequences [the law of dilation of gases] only with the greatest reserve, being aware how much I have yet to vary my experiments and how easy it is to go astray in interpreting the results: but although the new researches that engage me are 13 immense, I will not be put off by their difficulty." Yet Gay-Lussac included among "laws" items that transcend positive knowledge, for example, that all chemical combination involves the coming together of "elementary molecules" and that the properties of bodies express "the attractions of molecules."14 The same usage occurs in the work of Malus (Ecole polytech nique, 1794, M.F.C, 1810). He devoted endless hours to establish ing descriptive laws, both experimental and analytical. It was he who confirmed Huygens' empirical rules for the behavior of light passed through bi-refringent crystals, rules previously doubted in France owing to poor experimental technique and to distate for the wave theory in which Huygens expressed his results. On the ana lytic side, Malus developed a quantitative account of light rays, con sidered solely as geometrical entities; in this mood he characteristi cally attached no physical significance to his striking result that, after a single reflection or refraction, all the rays in the same bundle stand perpendicular to the same surface or front.15 Huygens' rules and the geometry of light rays are model positivistic laws. Not so the "laws" from which, in another mood, Malus proposed to deduce them. From Huygens' "laws," he said, "it follows neces sarily not only that light is a substance subject to the forces that give activity to other bodies, but also that the form and disposition of its molecules have a considerable influence on the phenomena." 13.

The creative ambiguity of Laplacian law appears to full advantage in a programmatic statement by Malus concerning his grand discovery of the polarization of light by reflection. After reciting the details of his experiments, he wrote: "The study of these diverse circumstances will lead us to the law of these phenomena, which depends on a general property of the repulsive forces that act on light."16 Here the law of the phenomena is almost entirely assimilated with the law of force. Malus' simultaneous enunciation of positivist and reductionist epistemologies, and his easy assimilation of both, may be the reason that the closest modern student of his work calls it "two-faced."17 A better characterization can be found. The play between renun ciation of truth claims and assertion of true knowledge occurs often in physics. On the psychological level, it helps to square a fashion able philosophy with the conviction that grows from, and may be prerequisite to, intense scientific work. On the epistemological level, its apparent contradiction may be removed by interpreting the reigning theoretical structure not as a true statement about the world, but as a definition of correct physics. The doctrine of forces was constitutive of Laplacian science much as circular motion denned Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy and mechanistic reduction certified British physics of the later 19th 18 century. Laplace and his followers did intend to pursue truth in physics, that is, faithfulness to force representations; but they did not worry about the fit between physics and reality beyond showing that experimental results were compatible with the general scheme. An excellent statement of the position, by Alexis-Therese Petit (Ecole poly technique, 1807), a collaborator of Pierre Louis Dulong (Ecole polytechnique, 1801, R.A.S. 1823), both of whom were asso ciated with the Arcueil group, appeared in the Journal of the Ecole 16.

Petit accepted that cohesion, affinity, refrac tion, capillarity?the standard phenomena handled by Laplace's circle?derived from distance forces. "None of these phenomena [however] is suitable for revealing the law of action of this molecu lar attraction." What is significant, what gives power to Laplace's approach, is that all these phenomena can be represented by dis tance forces. "The remarkable conformity of observed and calcu lated results guarantees beyond question the legitimacy of the 19 hypothesis that serves as the basis of this theory." That is the point: epistemological legitimacy, not ontological truth. From this point of view, what is perhaps the oddest feature of Laplacian physics may appear less peculiar. In contrast to forces of gravitation, electricity, and magnetism, the dependence on distance of the suppositious forces of optical refraction, capillary rise, cohe sion, affinity, and so on, was never made explicit. Laplacian physi cists did not hide their inability to provide the sort of information that astronomers and electricians had found essential. "I do not claim to indicate the cause of this general property of the repulsive forces that act on light," says Malus, or, for that matter, the real 20 shapes and forms of light particles. Laplace followed Malus' work closely, and sponsored some of it, in order to find a basis in the sys tem of forces and particles for the rules that Huygens had inter preted in favor of a wave theory. Both Laplace and Malus gave accounts?they can scarcely be called derivations?of double refrac tion in terms of distance forces and the principle of least action. By showing the compatibility of Huygens' empirical rules with the requirements of current physics, the accounts made the rules into law, and the findings into true knowledge, in accordance with Laplacian epistemology; they did so "although the nature of the force that makes the light rebound at the surface of bodies is not 21 known." Indeed, it appears that Laplace's system was so con structed that the forces could not be determined?their "laws" could 22 not be found?in principle. 19.

On the assumption that they did not act over sensible distances, they could figure in calculations much as the Dirac delta function does in quantum-mechanical computations. They left their traces as constants to be fixed by experiment; the fixing necessarily brought agreement between calculation and meas urement; and thus was the compatibility of the system of unknown forces with the unknowable system of nature fully demonstrated. In addition, the unknown forces gave the analysis generality; and, by freeing the analyst from the need to specify or simplify, to that extent purged it of anthropomorphic elements. Laplace ended his study and speculation about the forces of affinity, capillarity, cohe sion, and refraction about where he had begun, by supposing their identity.23 The supposition might seem to do little more than set unknown and unknowable things equal to one another. More gen erously interpreted, it transcribed the mathematician's insight that the more general the treatment or reach of a theory, the more faith ful to its principles it is likely to be. The dead hand Physics as practiced by the Societe d'Arcueil and the Parisian establishment that it dominated has been criticized for the inhibi tory effect of its patronage, the emptiness of its doctrine of forces, and the artificiality of its mathematics. No doubt patronage could and can be stifling: the protege usually cannot choose his problems, or interpret his results, without consulting the interests and posi tions of his boss. Among the more benign consequences of these constraints was Gay-Lussac's conclusion from his discovery of the law of combination of gases by volume. He acknowledged that the law favored systems, like Dalton's atoms and Proust's laws of com bination, opposed by Berthollet.24 Like a diplomat or a quantum physicist, Gay-Lussac reconciled the opposition by inventing "this great chemical law: whenever two substances come into one another's presence, within their sphere of activity, they act accord ing to their masses, and generally give compositions in very variable 23.

Dulong and Petit, whose law of specific heats of metals favored the atomic theory, had to break 26 from the legacy of Arcueil. Others could not. Biot and Poisson, for example, held to the doc trine of distance forces long after the development of the wave theory of light by Augustin Fresnel had bankrupted the concept in optics. What remained of Laplace's world picture after the removal of the forces was the positivistic background. And thus historiogra phy has punished him twice, once for the scheme of microphysics that led nowhere and again for making French physics safe for the 27 positivism that was to stunt its growth. This historiography, which is British, echoes attacks on Laplace made by his contemporaries, the British physicists Thomas Young and John Leslie. Young condemned Laplace's (and Malus') theory of double refraction as arbitrary, insufficient, and physically meaning less, a mathematical artifice and nothing more. By refusing to give an explicit form to the suppositious force of refraction, Laplace was not playing the game of physics as Young understood its rules. "He contents himself with saying that the velocity within the crystal must depend only on the situation of the ray with respect to the axis, and that this is a necessary 'condition' of the refraction_[But] the deduction of this 'condition' from any assignable laws of attrac tion is the only difficulty in question." Young's difficulty ran deeper, however. It was not only that Laplace did not give the physics, he used his prowess as a mathematician to obscure it. And so did all those great European analysts who appropriated and mystified the quantifiable parts of physics. "The first mathematicians on the Con tinent have exerted great ingenuity in involving the plainest truths of mechanics in the intricacies of algebraical formulas, and in some instances have even lost sight of the real state of the investigation, 25.

Laplace's formula for correcting the barometer was "extremely com plex and inelegant;" Poisson, in developing electrostatics, "exercised profound skill in the play of analysis.. .without, however, arriving at any conclusion that is not obvious or of no value;" and the whole lot, invoking "the higher calculus to unfold the motions of gaseous fluids," expended their skill and ingenuity without gaining 29 "any material result." It is worth emphasizing that this attitude was not confined to that "damned ignorant set in everything which relates to mathematics," as Charles Babbage characterized the Brit ish scientific establishment. Prevost wrote for many continental natural philosophers when he expressed irritation at the effort mas tering French mathematical physics had cost him. "So great a piling up of calculations (hardly necessary in my opinion).. .[when the author] could and should have set forth his interesting results more simply."30 The exaltation of mathematics was peculiar to France, where, according to a recent essay, it prospered under the Empire in part because Napoleon could neutralize squabbles among mathemati cians while encouraging their performances. Excellence in mathematics was a means of upward mobility, through Lycee and 31 polytechnic to Arcueil and the First Class. Those who were not good at it deplored or wondered at its ascendency. Bernardin de Saint Pierre, a writer capable, in Biot's opinion, of exemplary taste, style, and sensibility, could not understand why his essay into natural philosophy, his Etudes de la nature (1784), had not suc ceeded among scientists.

A MATHEMATICAL FIGLEAF Clairaut and Newton As the cases of electricity and magnetism illustrate, a primary objective of astronomizing physics was to find the precise depen dence of the forces between interacting elements on the distance between them. The business faced the grave difficulty that, insofar as the merit of any proposed law of force was its fit with observa tion or experiment, it could always be altered a little as cir cumstances seemed to require. How build solidly on so shaky a basis? Cartesians repeatedly objected that Newton's methods would lead to physics by finagling. The objection might appear far fetched: but in 1745 precisely the sort of fiddling that the Cartesians had anticipated was practiced on the law of gravity itself. In that year, Alexis-Claude Clairaut, Jean d'Alembert, and Leonhard Euler each independently made the non-discovery that the law of inverse squares did not give the observed rate of advance of the moon's perigee. Clairaut thereupon proposed to add an inverse-cube force to Newton's square. That did doctrine less violence than the repulsive suggestion made by his confrere at the Paris Academy, Pierre Bouguer, that different parts of planets might attract according to different laws, Newton's being a fortuitous average. There was a row in the Academy over these proposals. Its remaining Cartesian fellow travellers had the satisfaction of having their worries confirmed while its few true Newtonians, led noisily by Buffon, protested that the law must be left as promulgated, simple, esthetic, and universal. The apparent exception in the lunar motion had to be sought in secondary causes. The row subsided when the moon 36 struck mathematicians carried their approximations further. Clairaut's amendment of Newton's rule may have indicated a disinterest in the true cause of gravity (he had no opinion, he once said, about the nature of attraction, "which lies beyond my power"), but it did not imply withdrawal from the project of finding 36.

An account of his treatment of the refraction of light and the rise of liquids in capillary tubes will show the practical problem of deducing the laws of short-range forces. It will also provide a benchmark for evaluating the approach to the same subjects that Laplace took half a century later. In the Principia, Newton examined the motion of a small body traveling between two infinite parallel planes and urged or impelled toward (or away from) one of them by a constant force perpendicu lar to both. (The force vanishes everywhere except between the planes, and no other force acts on the body.) The motion between the planes will be a piece of a parabola, as in Galileo's analysis of the trajectories of cannon balls; and the parabolic piece will be tangent at each end to the straight lines along which the body pro ceeded, and will proceed, when free from the force. In figure 3.2.1, Aa and Bb are the planes, GH and IK the initial and final lines of motion, and HI the parabola. Newton showed that the sine of incidence of the body on one plane stands in a constant ratio to the sine of emergence from the other irrespective of the angle at which the body strikes the first plane. The proof runs in the demanding synthetic style by making use of the geometry of the parabola. Produce the tangents at H and I until they intersect at L; with LI as radius, draw the circle QNP. Two properties of the parabola are required: that L bisects HM and that HM /MI equals the latus rec tum of the curve, which depends on the strength of the force. Now NM is the same for all angles of incidence since it equals the fixed separation of the planes, IR. (HM is bisected at L, whence MO = OR and ON = OI; equals added to equals give MN = IR.) From a well-known proposition about secants and circles, MLMN = MQ-MP = ML - LQ) (ML + LQ) = ML2 - LQ2 = ML2 - LI2. 2 This is the relationship desired. Divide both sides by ML : (MI/ML2)-MN = 1 - (LI/ML)2, or (LI/ML) =1- (latus rectum)-(plate separation). The right side, and hence LI/ML, are therefore given for the prob lem. But in triangle LMI, LMI = i is the angle of incidence and LIM = 7T - r is the supplement of the angle of emergence. By the 37.

The motion in each will be parabolic and the preceding derivation therefore holds for any continuous law of force that urges or impels the body between the planes. Newton concluded coyly that "these attractions bear a great resemblance to the reflections and refractions of light.. .discovered by Snel."38 FIG. 3.2.1 Newton's diagram of the path of light through a refractive medium.

There Newton shows that Snel's law follows from the assumption that the "motion or moving thing" retains its velocity parallel to the planes when passing between them. "And this demonstration being general, without determining what light is, or by what kind of force it is refracted, or assuming anything farther than that the refracting body acts on the rays in lines perpendicular to its surface; I take it to be a very convincing argument of the full 39 truth of this proposition [Snel's law]." Clairaut handled the mathematics so as to reintroduce the physi cal problem that Newton had suppressed in one of his fits of easy instrumentalism. For his rhetorical purpose, which was to ease the entry of Newton's methods into French mathematical physics, Clairaut went back to the derivation of the Principia, which showed, he said, how usefully and yet how harmlessly the concept of attrac tion could be applied to ordinary problems in optics. "He said so lit tle about the matter that I think I should begin with an explanation very similar to his, which I put forth the more willingly because it shows that I do not reject the belief that attraction can be replaced by its mechanical cause."40 Clairaut's sop to his colleagues' sensibili ties was to replace the attraction of the surface of the body by a pressure within a shallow "atmosphere" surrounding it. In figure 3.2.2, the limit of the atmosphere runs through A, where the parti cle of light (here Clairaut did not mince words) begins to feel a pressure X(x) toward the plane surface through B. Let the initial velocities at A be vx down and vy to the left; under X(x) the particle describes the unknown curve AMB. The sine of the angle of emer gance from any plane through the curve, at M say, is easily obtained from the differential calculus. We have from figure 3.2.2 sinY = dy(dy2+dx2)~1/2. At any point, dy/dt=vy and d2x/dt2 = X; therefore (dx/dt)2 = v2 + 2Q, where Q(b) is the integral of Xdx from x = b to x = 0. Consequently, (dx/dy)2 = (v2 + 2Q)/v2f and 39. Opticks, Bk.

Limit of atmosphere Surface of refracting body FIG. 3.2.2 Geometry of Clairaut's theory of refraction, 1739. The light path is AMB; i is the angle of incidence, r that of refraction. The factor (l + 2Q(fr)//2) is the square of the index of refraction fx. To derive \x from first principles required finding the force law X(x) and its effective range b, which Clairaut supposed to be short but measurable. He regarded this problem, and the associated one of working out the curve described by light particles undergoing refraction, as a serious research goal; and he took a first step toward it by computing /x for the case that X~x~n. He brought the same point of view to the analysis of other phenomena apparently regu lated by short-distance focus, notably the rise of liquids in narrow tubes. Clairaut again began where Newton?or, in this case, one of Newton's collaborators, James Jurin?left off. Jurin's experiments had made plausible the proposition that the force that caused water</page><page sequence="163">LAPLACE'S SCHOOL / 155 to rise in capillary tubes was exerted by a ring around the tube just above the water.41 Clairaut liked the experiments but not the theory: a proper account, he said, would sum "all the attractions of every particle of the glass on all the particles of the water," with due regard for the different directions and magnitudes of the forces.4 A pleasant and fertile field thus opened to the analyst. ABCDEFGH in figure 3.2.3 designates the walls of the capillary tube, YIZ the meniscus, and MNP the level of the water outside the tube; IKLM are imaginary, infinitely narrow canals of unit cross sec tion. Clairaut deduced an expression for the height li = h of the capillary column from the principle that the canal must be in equili brium under the static forces acting on it: the pressure at L(pL) equals the pressure at K(pK).

Call the first kF(x) and the second hF(x), and assume that F is of short range, "sensible only at a very small distance." Now pL = gML + jkF(x)dx, where g is the acceleration of gravity and the integral arises from the pull of the water on particles close to the surface MN. (The particle v at distance x beneath MN feels a down ward force if x &lt; R, the effective range of the attraction. The limits on the integral are 0 and R, or, what is the same, 0 and oo, since F(x)~0 for x&gt;R.) The pressure at K is glK less the attractions A\ on the particles around I and Aq on those around O. Clairaut obtained expressions for these attractions by taking all the material within the tube and the tube prolonged beneath CH into account: by this method, characteristic for his approach, he could extend his integrals to infinity although the forces act sensibly only over dis tances of the order of the interior radius (= b) of narrow tubes. A particle at R within a short distance x of O will be drawn upwards by the tube and downwards by the water contained within an extension of the tube below CH; a particle at Q will have a simi lar experience; hence A0 = -(h -k)jF(x,b)dx, where b indicates that the attraction depends upon the radius of the tube. At P a short distance x below I, we may suppose the tube made of water, since, by symmetry, the force at P exerted by the glass cancels. That allows us to write the downward pull of the water as k^F(x)dx, without dependence on b. This is countered by the upward pull of the tube (which has been assimilated to water), k jF(x,b)dx, and of the meniscus YZXV, say |G(x,b,h,k)dx. In all, Ai = fF(x)dx-kfF(x,b)dx- fG(x,b,h,k)dx. The condition of equilibrium gives for the height h = Ii, 00 oo h = ((2h -k)/g)\F{xfb)dx +{\/g)\G(x,b,h,k)dx. From all this Clairaut extracted only that analysis can express the results of experiment. "Without pursing the calculation further to evaluate [the integrals] according to the different functions of the distance that might be taken to express the law of attraction, one</page><page sequence="165">LAPLACE'S SCHOOL / 157 easily sees that there is an infinite number of such laws for which the preceding equation for.. .[Ii] will give an appreciable height when the diameter of the tube is very small, and, on the contrary, a height nearly null when the tube is a little large. It is obvious that a law of attraction exists that will make Ii inversely proportional to the diameter, in accordance with experiment."43 It is also obvious that Clairaut thought it desirable and feasible to search for the law. His instrumentalism, as indicated by his willingness to tinker with the sacred theory of gravitation, did not extend to introducing a force of which the most useful mathematical property was that its law need not (and in practice, could not) be found. That brilliant cynical advance in mathematical physics was the work of Laplace. The Laplace transformation Laplace attacked the theories of refraction and capillarity in the hope of finding the laws that had eluded Clairaut. He pondered for long, he wrote, before discovering the solution, or, as he might better have said, before learning how to avoid the problem. The solution, and the basis of Laplace's molecular physics: if the forces are sensible not over very short distances, as in Clairaut's formula tion, but only over insensible distances, then the form of the force function does not matter at all.44 Laplace could always manage the calculations so that the force occurred only in integrals that ran from zero to infinity. No parameter representing the range?the thickness of an attracting layer, or a fraction of the diameter of a capillary tube, or the power of the distance law?survived the calcu lations. And this very fact, which would have been a blemish in a realist theory, was a virtue to Laplace. It enabled him to complete his calculations. An easy introduction to this aspect of Laplace's physics may be obtained from his elucidation of refraction. In figure 3.2.4, a light particle with speed / enters the refracting region at A. It then suffers the accelerating force, which bends its trajectory as shown. Laplace calculated the ratio of sinr to sin/ much as Clairaut had done: 43. Ibid., 121 (?ix). 44.

For him, the experimental value of the index of refraction determined the value of K; for Clairaut, the appropriate choice of X would allow a deriva tion of the value of the index. Like the forces it invoked, Laplace's system could not penetrate sensibly beneath the surface of things.45 This fig-leaf physics had the enthusiastic support of the mathemati cians in Laplace's entourage. Malus may be allowed to speak for them all: "[short forces] have the advantage that their overall influence appears alone in the calculated results, so that the law of the phenomena is independent of the function of the distance according to which they exercise their action."46 Superficial need not mean useless. That much at least emerged from Laplace's elaborate reworking of Clairaut's theory of capillar ity. The new approach obtains the net uplift on the central canal within the capillary tube from a consideration only of the force act ing between water particles. The glass walls of the tube are too far from the canal to affect it directly; they participate by attracting the contiguous layer of water, thereby holding the column against the downward pull of the fluid just beneath the meniscus. The resulting curvature of surface provides the capillary pull, as follows.47 45. Laplace, Oeuvres (1878), 4, 235-239, 248, 275. 46. Malus, Mem. divers savants, 2 (1811), 338. 47.

Thus he gave a second example, to go with optical refraction, of the success ful subjugation of molecular physics to analysis. What the con stancy of the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refrac tion was to the one, the inverse proportionality between capillary rise and tube diameter was to the other.49 As appears from figure 3.2.7, l/b = cos0/r, r being the radius of the tube.

The theoretical results can be obtained with great precision, and, by comparing them with very exact experiments, these theories can be brought to the highest degree of certainty of which the natural sci ences are capable."50 Laplace's circle applauded his treatment of capillary rise as the cynosure of physical theory. It tied the material world together, according to Ha?y, who wrote in this respect like a big-bang cosmologist: Laplace used the same formulas to account for capillar ity as he did "to explain the greatest phenomena of the universe." Furthermore, added Biot, having found "with exactitude the true cause" of the ascent of fluids in narrow tubes, Laplace was poised to enrich chemistry with a proper theory of affinity. Only a truly superior mind could have mastered the relevant mathematics, astronomy, physics, and, eventually, chemistry.

We already know Young's views about Laplace's theories?"unnecessarily intricate.. .[and without] any novelty." John Playfair objected that Laplace had inverted cause and effect: not the concavity of the meniscus, but the attraction between the liquid and the glass, sustains the rise. Gauss objected that Laplace did not prove, but only assumed, an essential piece of the phenomena, the constancy of the angle of contact. "In my opinion this centerpiece of Laplace's theory in no way deserves to rank with the precise mathematical foundation of his other theories, but rather seems to have the character of the vague apercus that physicists earlier enter tained about the entire phenomenon."52 Nonetheless, Laplace's treatment of capillarity dominated the subject during the 19th cen tury, in part because H is closely related to the constant of surface tension. In figure 3.2.7, the radius of the tube is r, the upward ten sion at the glass surface is 7COS0 per unit length, and the suspended column weighs girr2h. Hence pgirr2h = 27rr7COS(/&gt;, h = (2y/pg){sm6/r) = 2y/bpg, whence H = 2y. More fundamentally, the phenomena represented by K occur in gases as well as in liquids. J.D. van der Waals repro duced and built on Laplace's derivation of H and K in his famous thesis of 1873, which modified the perfect gas law to take K into account and obliterated the distinction between liquids and gases. Lord Rayleigh, while criticizing Laplace for leaving out molecules and for obscuring the meaning of K, nonetheless had recourse to it, under the guise of an "intrinsic pressure," in his own fundamental theory of capillarity and van der Waals' forces.53 Profound physical discoveries eventuated from the implacable mathematizing of dis tance forces.

SOUND AND FURY Lagrange and Newton Newton's derivation of his formula for the speed of sound in air has not earned him good marks from the cognoscenti. "A dark and convoluted argument," says Johann Bernouilli; "perhaps the most difficult and obscure place in the Principia" (d'Alembert); "contrad ictory. .., vague, and indeterminate," fit for a physicist but not for a mathematician (Lagrange); and, to put the same point with poli tesse, "one of the most remarkable features of [Newton's] genius" (Laplace).54 Nonetheless, an entire 18th-century-full of mathemati cians could do no better. After Lagrange had cleaned up Newton's mess, he had only confirmed the original result: the speed of sound is the square root of the ratio of the average pressure to the average density (c = V/Vpo) of the medium through which the sound waves 55 pass. The continental mathematicians gave Newton a bad rap. His demonstration suffered from its old-fashioned form and limped under the assumption of a special case; but it was also pioneering, ingenious, and generalizable. The argument is easy enough to fol low with an occasional translation into the language of analysis. In Newton's physical picture, elastic particles, EF, FG, etc. (figure 3.3.1), of equal, microscopic extent, vibrate one after the other, each going through the same notion, assumed to be simply periodic, a time At behind the particle immediately before it.56 The sum of all the physical lines EF, FG defines the extent of the "pulse," X; hence, if t designates the period of the harmonic motion, At/r = EF/X. After a time t, the points E, F, G have been displaced by the wave to e, 0, y. Note that their original position was not necessarily that of equilibrium; indeed, as the next step shows, Newton started to follow the motion when EF stood at its maximum displacement 54.

The motion dilates EG into ey = EG + G7 - Ee = EG - LN. From the similar triangles KHQ and IOM, LN/KH = IM/fl, whence the expanded volume becomes EG - IM KH/fl = EG(1 - IM/ X). The substitution of X = X/2tt for EG/KH comes from At/r = HI/2tt0 = EF/X and KH = 2HI, EG = 2EF. Assume in accordance with Boyle's law that the elastic force exerted by a "particle" of air is inversely proportional to its compression. Therefore the elastic force or pressure in ey is p = k m /EG(1 - IM/X). (3.3.1) Here k = Po/po converts density to pressure and m = pV = p0V0 is the mass of air in ey or EG.

(The paradox arose from assuming the special case of simple harmonic motion and supposing its consequence to hold in general.) Lagrange's more general investigation dispelled the paradox by arriving at the very expression for c that Newton had deduced from his special assumption.58 Here is the more general (and elegant) investigation.59 In figure 3.3.3, the particles that occupied the volumes a dx (a is the cross section of the air mass perpendicular to AB) left and right of x at t = 0 have moved into the volumes o-EFGH and txGHIJ, respectively, at time t.

But was it? Despite finagling with the numbers, Newton could not bring his theoretical value of c (some 1000 ft/sec) up to the best measured value (1142 ft/sec). His desperate means of accounting for the discrepancy of over ten percent was to stock the atmosphere with solid particles of water vapor through which sound might move instantaneously.60 Lagrange did not worry much about the shortfall; the match was good enough for a mathematician if not for a physicist. "It amounts to only a tenth_In any case, it should not be surprizing that the theory differs a little from measurement where absolute quantities are concerned, since we know that com plicated experiments can never furnish the simple data free from extraneous circumstances that pure analysis requires of them." But if necessary, analysis could always save the numbers. The analyzer needed only to take some other relationship between pressure and density than that prescribed by Boyle's law. Lagrange proposed p = pn, which would increase the value of the speed of sound by nh. To bring theory into agreement with experiment, n had to equal about 1.3, which, as Lagrange said, would have required departures from Boyle's law so large that he could scarcely credit that any good physicist could have missed them.

Nor were there useful direct advances in theory; the young Turks around Laplace who worked out the promising ideas of their mentor thought that only Lagrange's account was worth considering.62 But theoretical advances in other directions made the problem newly tractable around 1800. To a head filled with the caloric theory of gases, a way to augment the velocity of sound theoretically was not far to seek. Biot later represented the successful approach as a matter of common sense. Anyone should have been able to deduce that a sound wave must heat the medium through which it passes; otherwise it would condense saturated vapors through which it tried to pass. To save the sound in saturated vapor, compression would have to release heat. That presented no trouble to the informed savant of 1800. Several examples of the adiabatic heating (or cooling) of gases were then circulating in the journals of sci 63 ence. Laplace first indicated this line of thought in 1803, in two notes supporting the caloric model of gases as described in the Statique chimique of his friend Berthollet. Laplace reasoned from the assumption that the pressure in a gas is proportional to the number of molecules (n, say) pressing immediately against unit surface of the containing vessel and to the density of free caloric (w). Let the vessel be a box with floor area A and height h, and let it contain N molecules. Then n = (N/Ah)(Ad), where d is the closest distance between molecules, and w = Q(V,T)/V, where Q is the total free caloric in the box, V is the volume Ah, and T is the temperature. Laplace asked for the amount of caloric set free in an isothermal compression to half the original volume. Since by hypothesis, poc(nw)/A =NQd/V2, and since in isothermal processes pV = const., we have Qd/V = const. In his first note, Laplace mistakenly stated that the number of molecules acting immediately on the surface A doubles during the 62. Poisson, Ecole poly., //, 7:14 (1808), 325. 63.

Now a sound wave passing through a gas produces volume changes, and the consequent play of caloric affects the velo city. Indeed, "it produces the excess of this velocity over that given by the ordinary theory, as I have assured myself by calculation."64 The insight was deep, the calculation mistaken. In his second note, Laplace recognized that d varies as V1/3, so that in an isother mal compression to half volume the free heat sinks to Q/22/3 or over 0.6Q rather than the 0.5Q of the earlier calculation. "The gas gives off less than half of the heat it originally contained, which agrees with experiment and with the observed velocity of sound."65 That even in this second state of enlightenment Laplace was far from a derivation of this elusive quantity appears from the calcula tion done by Biot under his direction and published in 1802. Biot's unnecessarily elaborate mathematics may be simplified without loss as follows.66 To augment c, one need only replace Po in the usual formula with a larger quantity, which has its origin in an increase in temperature occasioned by the caloric freed by the sound wave during its passage. Biot begins with a slight rewriting of Lagrange. The increase of the volume adx in time dt (see figure 3.3.3) is adx(l + dy/dx); whence the specific increase in volume, AV/V0 = dxo{\ + dy/dx - \)/dxa), is dy/dx. But AV/V = -Ap/p, which gives, to the second order of small quantities, dp/dx = -p0d2y/dx2. The net force acting on the volume at time t is -o~(dp/dx)dx, which must equal p0adxd2y /dt2. Hence, d2y = _J_dp_ = _J_Po d_ dy_ = Po d2y dt2 Po d* Po Po fa P? d* Po dx2 ' where the relation between pressure and volume is that stipulated in Boyle's law. Biot repeated this calculation with the hypothesis p = po(l+s)(l+fo)~p0(l+(l + fc)s), (3.3.3) 64. Laplace, Oeuvres (1878), 14, 329-331, on 331; cf. Arnold, AHES, 28 (1983), 275-276. 65.

The factor k takes account of the increase in pressure, above that owing to compression, induced by the adiabatic heating. Proceeding as before, Biot found |f -?l{l + kA (3.3.4) dtz Po dxA We have arrived at another Laplacian k. Unlike the quantities in the theories of refraction and capillarity, however, the k in equation (3.3.4) was incalculable only in practice. Biot did what he could to estimate its value. According to old measurements by Guillaume Amontons, air heated by 80? Reaumur increases its pressure by a third; according to Gay-Lussac's then recent and immaculate results, in the same temperature range the volume increases by 35 percent. In equation (3.3.3), the first factor on the right refers to changes in pressure deriving from changes in volume, the second to aug mentations of pressure owing to caloric effects. If the measurements of Amontons and Gay-Lussac had been made at constant volume, we might gather from (3.3.3), as Biot did, that ^ = 0.33 = *^ = 0.35*, Po Po and thus that k = 0.95. Biot took the uncorrected theoretical value for c to be 915 ft/s and the best measured value (that done by the Paris Academy in 1783) to be 1038 ft/s. But 915(1.95)1/2 = 1278, not 1038. He had overshot the mark. Working backwards from the answer, he got k = 0.29; using Amontons' result that the pressure increased by a third in 80?R, he set the increment/degree at 1/240; and thence he gathered that the increase in temperature, AT = (0.29)(240?), produced in the condensations of a sound wave was 69?. Was that implausible? "[Not] if you take into account that we deal with very small quantities of air in contact with highly con ductive walls and that our thermometers have a considerable mass in comparison with the air in which they are immersed_How easy it is to reconcile in this way calculation and experiment in one of the most important theories of mathematical physics [physique 67 mathematique]\" 67.

Lagrange had understood it all, according to Poisson, for he had seized the cardinal point about the development of heat. Was that the full and sufficient cause for the annoying discrepancy between theory and measurement? "It seems to me that such a conclusion follows if no objection can be made to the [mathematical] analysis from which the velocity of sound is deduced, and if at the same time all the physical circumstances that can affect the result have been taken into account in the calcula tion."68 No doubt. But Poisson had to satisfy himself with squeez ing the data in the manner of Biot. To obtain the suppositious rise in temperature needed to give k its observed value, Poisson likened the condensation caused by a sound wave to a heating at constant pressure to the required tem perature T2 followed by an isothermal compression to the initial density p\. His only experimental datum was Gay-Lussac's measure ment of the dilation of gases at constant pressure, V = V*(l + eTc), where the asterisk indicates a value at the freezing point of water and Tc expresses centigrade degrees. Let the measurement of the speed of sound be done at T^C, where the air's density, po, is p*V*/Vi = p*/(l + eTi). Compressed by a sound wave, the air at acquires a density px = p0(l +s); after heating at constant pressure to T2, a density p2 = p*(l + s)/(l + eT2); and, after isothermal compression back to Tv p3 = px. Boyle's law holds along the isoth ermal, whence the final pressure p3 may be derived from the initial: 1 + eT2 eAT P3 = PliPl/Ps) = POO + S)1xT = P0(1 + + -j ) (3.3.5) In order to bring this expression into a form parallel to Biot's, Pois son took AT to be proprotional to s, say ms, which gave for k the value me/(l + eT{). Before putting in some numbers, it will be useful to change nota tion. As Poisson observed in a later treatment of the problem,69 68. Poisson, Ecole poly., //, 7:14 (1808), 325-326. 69.

This may be expressed as p = const, p (1/e + Tc) = const, p (T* + Tc) = const. pT , where T* = 1/e is the temperature of the freezing point of water above "absolute zero." Poisson's physical assumptions now appear as pi = p0(l + s), p2 = (T1/T2)pi, p3 = Poil + sXT^T,) = Po(l + s)(l + te), (3.3.6) where k = m /T1. Poisson's uncorrected theoretical value for c(T) at T* was 279.4 m/s. At 6?C, where the hardy academicians of 1738 made their measurements, c(6) = 282.4 m/s; here the density of air has been computed from Gay-Lussac's law of expansion with e = 0.00375. The academicians obtained 337.2 m/s, whence the empirical value of k = 0.425. We have then that m=fcT1=(0.425)(l/e + 6) = 116?C. Hence a dilation or compression of 1/116 would produce a rise of temperature of one degree. "Admitting this result, which cannot be confirmed by any direct experiment, the difference in velocity [of sound], which Newton was the first to notice, can be made to disappear."70 Enter y The outcome again was a brave fizzle: as in the cases of optical refraction and capillarity, the essential quantity could not be deduced from the theory. Contrary to the situations controlled by the short-range forces, however, further articulation of the underly ing theory allowed a reformulation that made possible a most attractive interpretation of the constant k. The factor ms/Ti = AT/T1 is the correction owing to the heat of compression, AQ. If we assume that the heating takes place so quickly that the gas retains its heat, then AQ = CVAT, where Cv is the specific heat at the compressed volume. Laplace's group pictured the difference 70. Poisson, Ecole poly, //., 7:24 (1808), 360-364.

Therefore, Cp - Cv indicates this latent heat, which would become free in a sudden compression that raises temperature by AT.

They began with two samples of gas at the same temperature Ti = T2 and occupying the same volume Vi = V2 but under different pressures pi and p2. (Evidently the samples contained amounts of gas in the ratio of the pressures.) The experiment con sisted of measuring the heats AQ2 and AQX given off during cooling at constant pressure to a common final temperature. Laplace sup posed, "with many physicists," that the heat in a sample of air kept under a constant pressure is proportional to its volume; and he claimed that, on this supposition, y ? ?? = r y-.

Therefore y = 1.5, which brought the speed of sound up to 345.9 m/s, a little beyond the 337.2 m/s of the academicians of 1738. With greater plausibility than Poisson or Biot, Laplace could assign the remaining discrepancy to errors in the measurements: 71. Laplace, Oeuvres (1878), 14, 298; cf. Sebastian!, Physis, 23 (1981), 401-402.

Does equation (3.3.7) follow from the assumptions? Recent his torians who have tried to deduce it have had to feign implausible 73 hypotheses to succeed. No doubt, some improper assumption seems required, since Laplace worked with the misinformation that Cp depends strongly on the temperature. In fact, however, no spe cial hypotheses are required to gain equation (3.3.7). From Laplace's basic assumption, the heats in the two gases at the start are kiV1 and k2V2, and, at the end, fciVY and k2V2/ where the Zc's depend only on the pressures and the primes indicate final states. Hence, AQ2/AQl = k2AV2/k1AV1 = k2lkx. (The equality of the volume differences follows from Vx = V2, Tx = T2, T{ = T2.) We need only derive the k's. In its expansion at p\, the first sample loses heat CPl(T1'-T1) = k1(V1'-V1). But V^-V, = R/(T1'-Tx)Pl. Hence k\ = P\CpJR. To get k2, imagine a sample of gas at p2 equal in quantity to that held at pv Tv and occupying the same volume V1. The temperature of this sample, T3, is (p2/p\)Ti.

Although neither the theory nor the experiment was secure nor their agreement outstanding, they confirmed Laplace in his belief that the ratio of the specific heats was the quantity he needed. Two ways were then open to complete this corner of Laplacian physics. One was to improve the numbers with experiments undertaken ad hoc. Gay-Lussac eventually obliged, in 1822, with excellent values for 7, which, to Laplace's great surprise, seemed to be the same for all values of pressure and temperature employed in the experi ments. The best value, 7 = 1.3748, brought the speed of sound up to 337.1 m/s at 16?C, the comfortable temperature at which a new set of academicians, activated by Laplace, had remeasured it. The measurement gave 340.9 m/s. Laplace ascribed the discrepancy of less than one percent to water vapor in the atmosphere.74 Again the figleaf The other route to setting the speed of sound, and thereby the caloric theory firmly within Laplacian physics, was to derive the factor Cp/Cy from a model built on short-distance forces. Here Laplace followed two strategies. The first derived the laws of Boyle and Gay-Lussac, on which the theory of 1816 depended, from the model. The second introduced the model directly into the mechanics of the propagation of waves. The model: each gas molecule carries an envelope of caloric; hence each suffers repulsions between its envelope and its neighbors', and attractions between itself and the environing envelopes and molecules; but in practice, the caloric caloric repulsion greatly outweighs the other forces present. Each molecule constantly loses part of its envelope owing to bombard ment by radiant heat from other molecules; each molecule con stantly captures itinerant caloric; in the steady state, the gain bal ances the loss. We are again ready to calculate.75 Let the gas of density p be contained in a cylindrical vessel of radius a and height h, and let every molecule have a dose of caloric 74.

We ask for the force dF exerted on a narrow column of gas begin ning just under the lid and running to the bottom of the cylinder. As usual, the force is proportional to the "masses" or "charges" of interacting elements, in this case to pcdV and pcdV, where the dVs are the elementary volumes, and to a short-range force where / is the distance between the centers of dV and dV. Thus the elemen tary force is Hp2c2dVdV'(f)(f), H being a constant. Take for dV a portion of gas with area rdrdd and thickness dz (figure 3.3.4), for dV an element a distance s below the lid with cross section dA and depth ds. Then the downward force in the vertical direction exer cised on the column by all the caloric within the cylinder is Because of the short range, a and h may be taken as infinite and the integrations performed precisely as in the theory of capillarity. We have therefore for p = pz = dF/dA, the pressure against the lid, where K is the uncalculable constant that represents the result of 76 the integrations. Now let our molecules suffer from bombardment by radiant caloric, which knocks off bits of their envelopes. The loss for each molecule will be proportional to the density of caloric in the gas, pc, and to the quantity of caloric in its envelope, c, whence loss equals ape2.

The compression in the third step, s = (P3 ~ Pi) I1 Pir can be expressed in terms of the pressures meas ured in the experiment: since p3 = p4 and p2/p4 = Pi/V?&gt; s = (p4 - p2)/p2. Similarly, the fractional rise in temperature during the compression u = (T3-T1)/Ti = (pi~P4)/p4. From their numbers, Poisson made s = 0.01355 and u = 0.00473. Now, according to equations (3.3.5) and (3.3.6), which contain Poisson's theory of 1807, ks = AT/Tl = u, whence k = u/s = 0.3492 and c = (po/po)1/2(1.3492),/2 = 331.97 m/s, something short of the Bureau des Longitudes' 340.89 m/s. After correction for the difference in temperature at which the measurements were made, Poisson came out 6.23 m/s short, "which can be attributed to errors of observa ?80 tion. The same line of thought leads easily to Laplace's correction 7. Take a volume V\ of air at temperature Tx - 6, where 6 is a small quantity, and heat it at constant pressure to T2 = Ty the undertak ing will require an amount of heat Cp0 and occasion a dilation s. Now compress the gas to V\, by hypothesis, the temperature increases by AT = ksT^ (that is the definition of k). If it now cools down to its original temperature at constant volume, it will give up heat Cy(0 + AT) = Cv(d + ksT{). The heat must have come from what was supplied during the initial expansion: 79.

Colbert needed to know the extent of the kingdom for long-term civil estimates and for short-term military maneuvers.1 Colbert's academicians, particularly Picard, liked the cartographic project for itself and because it provided the means for finding a reliable value for the radius of the earth, which "would be very subservient to several designs of his in astronomy." The union thus established between cartography mainly for the state and geodesy mainly for the geometer prospered during the Enlightenment, especially in France but also in Austria-Hungary, the Papal States, and Great Bri tain. The first section of this chapter describes the progress of French cartography; the second, the efforts to ascribe a shape to the earth. 1. CARTOGRAPHIC CONTROL A French business The first register of the Paris Academy's mathematical transac tions records that Colbert "wished that people would work at mak ing maps of France more reliable than any yet made and that the 1.

After outlining the elaborate procedure he proposed to fol low, he told the academicians that an arc of a meridian through Paris, when rigorously measured astronomically and trigonometri cally, would not only provide the basis for the most accurate map ever made; "also, we would have the benefit of being able to deter mine the size of the earth." Picard's political and scientific good sense appears again in his proposal to give the size in a unit that "would remain for posterity and not depend on our particular [prac tices]." The unit would be the length of a pendulum beating seconds in Paris. "So that the measure of the size of the earth first found by the difference in the heights of the pole, and with respect to the heavens, would be associated with the diurnal motion as a fundamental and convenient [quantity] available to every nation."4 With his 5 8-inch quadrant equipped with lenses and micrometer threads, Picard could measure the angles between distant objects to an accuracy 30 or 40 times greater than the inventor of the tri gonometric technique, Willebrord Snel, could manage. And that although the setting of the telescope by hand without mechanical help and the displacement of the mechanical from the optical center of the instrument introduced substantial sources of error.5 With his 10-foot sector, he found the difference in latitude 5\ between a church tower in Amiens, some 115 km north of Paris, and a 3.

Great care was required in making the measurements, which suffered from the flimsy mounting of the instrument and the difference in the expan sion of its iron body and brass limb; an error of a minute of arc in the sky translates into almost 2 km on the ground. Picard gave the zenith distance of his reference star to five seconds or less: and from the distance he calculated the arc between the stations to be a little under 1?23', and the length of a single degree to be around 57,060 toise (1 toise = l ts-2 meters). He effected the conversion from anglular to linear measure by laying out a pair of measuring rods one after another along a string to constitute a baseline, the ends of which he incorporated into his triangulation. The great length of this baseline, some 12 km, measured with great care and expense, contributed importantly to Picard's success. It was almost forty times longer than Snel's and five times longer than the previous maximum, a line of 1064 ts set out in 1645 by the Jesuits Francesco Maria Grimaldi and Giambattista Riccioli in a faulty determination of the distance between Modena and Bologna.6 Among Picard's associates in laying out bases and finding the arc was Gian-Domenico (Jean-Dominique) Cassini, brought from Bologna in 1669 to assist in the completion of the Paris Observa tory. Picard and Cassini also oversaw a project to map the environs of Paris as a step toward fulfilling Colbert's commission. Cassini, who knew how to raise money for large projects, understood that Parisian astronomy would prosper along with French cartography; as he put the point for public consumption, "the chief goal the Academy set itself in its astronomical observations has always been their application to the advancement of geography and navi gation."7 In furtherance of this union, the Academy dispatched mis sions at the King's expense during the 1670s to find the longitudes of distant places by comparing their observations of eclipses of Jupiter's moons with the times of disappearance given in tables prepared by Cassini for the meridians of Bologna and Paris. 6.

It was on this voyage that Richer learned that a pen dulum clock that beat seconds in Paris was slow in Cayenne; a tropical lethargy that, in the opinion of Newton and others, sub verted the ancient assumption that the earth is a perfect sphere and greatly complicated the task of measurers of the globe.8 Jesuit mis sionaries added further data points; and Cassini kept track of it all, on a polar plot 24 feet in diameter traced on the stone floor of one of the towers of the Paris Observatory. A map made from this hard copy was published in 1696.9 The world proved easier to map than France. After Picard and Cassini had done some surveying around Paris and Provence, dur ing the course of which Picard perfected the application of the spirit level to the telescope, the Academy received the charge "to draw up a map of France with the greatest accuracy possible." That was in 1679. The first step, completed five years later, was a sketch of the kingdom, based on astronomically determined coordinates, which showed that ordinary maps had misplaced the western coastline of France into the Atlantic Ocean by as much as 150 km; in all, the academicians reduced French territory by no less than a fifth. That might help to account for the reluctance of Colbert's successor to support the project that Picard had proposed in 1681: the extension of the arc from Amiens to Dunkirk in the North and from Mal voisine to Perpignan in the South, to serve as the backbone for a series of triangles to cover all of France. No doubt also Picard's death in 1682, the political and religious difficulties of the end of the century, and the wars of the Spanish succession made it hard for ministers to perceive that the precise and expensive triangulation of an invisible line 950 km long from the English Channel to the Gulf of Lyon was necessary for grasping the real estate of France.

Jacques Cassini and Maraldi measured out a baseline along the beach near Perpignan with toise sticks aligned by telescope. To make possible the inclusion of the baseline in the system of trian gles, they set up tree trunks as markers on either end. Taking the baseline that Picard had measured near Amiens as their given, they calculated through the series of triangles what the base on the beach at Perpignan should be. The calculated and directly measured lengths of the distance between the tree trunks?some 7246 ts? agreed to within 3 ts before correction and precisely afterwards. A similar result, to within a single toise, was achieved with a base laid out across the dunes near Dunkirk. That was a singular coincidence, since many of Jacques Cassini's angles differed by 10 minutes, and a few by whole degrees, from later measurements made from his stations. His instruments, which included a large zenith sector made by Graham and a quadrant with a relatively small error of center, were at least as good as Picard's. Nonetheless, having determined the length of the triangulated arc from Dunkirk to Perpignan to be 8?31'12"/ Cassini gave the weighted average value of a degree over the distance as 57,061 ts, astonishingly/ suspiciously, close to Picard's.11 Cartography and territory seemed secure. As a sidelight, Cassini calculated that a degree of the arc north of Paris was slightly smaller than one taken to the south. The difference between consecutive degrees, amounting to some 31 ts, fell well within likely errors of measurement. Nevertheless, Jacques Cassini deemed it significant. Cassini pere had reached a similar conclusion from measurements he had made toward extending Picard's arc. Cassini fils had no interest in overlooking what he thought were facts that confirmed his late father's opinions; on the contrary, he might well have calculated that by emphasizing them he could make his own reputation separate from his father's. If confirmed, the variation in the length of degrees along a meridian would indicate that the earth is not a perfect sphere. That agreed 10.

But Newton and Huygens required the degrees to shorten toward the equator, and 12 Cassini had found them to grow. The implied challenge inspired much geodetic work, which usually piggy-backed on projects, like military or civilian cartography or the metric survey, which held greater interest for those who paid the bills than wrangles about the shape of the earth.13 On June 1, 1733, Jacques Cassini and his cousin Giovanni Domenico Maraldi left Paris at right angles to its meridian. They were on their way to St Malo, to begin to trace a parallel of latitude. By the end of 1735, they had triangulated all the way to Strasbourg, and the younger generation, represented by Jacques Cassinis son, Cesar-Francois Cassini de Thury (Cassini III), had brought the line in the West to Brest. They had been commissioned by Philibert Orry, Comptrolleur-General of France, to make a national map based upon a network of primary geodetic triangles covering the entire country. Most of the later work fell to Cassini III and Maraldi, who devoted themselves particularly to examining the coast from Cherbourg to Nice; they found it easier to survey than the wooded mountains of the hinterland, freer from suspicious peasants, and, above all, of greater interest, because of its strategic importance, to the state that supported them. By 1740, the enter prize had measured 400 primary triangles and a good many bases to a claimed accuracy (in cases where a base was measured twice) to around one part in 20,000. Four years later it had doubled its triangles and completed its assignment. The first Cassini national map, which finished the project started by Colbert, Picard, and Cas sini I, was published in 18 sheets in 1744. 12. J.D.

He reckoned without the Army. In 1746, toward the end of the War of the Aus trian Succession, Cassini (that is, Cassini de Thury, Cassini III) extended the family's triangles into Flanders at the request of the commanders of the invading force. The military engineers on the ground could not map it with the accuracy that the Cassinis had attained. Cassini did his mapping just behind the front lines. "I had no fear of being taken by the enemy," he said, "for I expected to be treated like M. de Maupertuis, who, having accompanied the King of Prussia into war, was taken prisoner to Vienna, where the Emperor and Empress treated him with a good will that made his captivity sweet and glorious." Cassini escaped captivity but not glory. In 1747 Louis XV came to review his troops in Flanders. He compared Cassini's maps with the terrain and was astonished at the agreement. "I wish the map of my kingdom drawn up in the same way," he told Cassini, "and I charge you with the task."15 Cassini set up an extensive operation centered on the Observa tory, trained surveyors, raised capital (beginning in 1756, when, at the outbreak of the Seven Years War, the treasury withdrew its sup port), and remapped France at a scale of 1:86,400 (1 ligne to 100 toises). He insisted that his men take all the angles in their triangles (which closed usually to under a minute of arc), use quadrants rather than planchettes, and go back over previous work when the original targets could be found. By 1783, they had found the dis tances of 400 villages and 3000 mills, bridges, and isolated houses from the meridian and the perpendicular through the Paris Obser vatory.16 On Cassini de Thury's death in 1784, the business was continued by his son and long-time co-adjutor, Jean-Dominique Cassini (Cassini IV), who also succeeded to the family fief of the Paris Observatory. The field work, which required some 40,000 tri angles, had been finished by the outbreak of the Revolution, but not all the engraving. Eventually the map appeared, on 180 sheets.

The revolutionary govern ment hired Cassini's engravers, who by then had finished 165 of the 180 sheets, to complete the map, and discharged Cassini (Cas sini IV), whose opinions were not revolutionary, from the Observa tory. The reliability of the second Cassini map declined with distance from the primary grids through Paris. The triangles in those grids closed with an accuracy of perhaps 10 seconds of arc; elsewhere, to 20 seconds. Baselines were measured by placing sticks end to end, much as in the manner of Picard. The angles in the primary trian gles were taken by sector and telescope; the field measurements, by plane table and compass.18 Although Cassini III had bettered the positioning of the telescope on the sectors and the reading of the limb, he neglected to strengthen the mountings of his instruments, whose wobblings probably nullified the effects of his improve ments.19 Some serious error crept in especially along the borders in the North and in Flanders and the Rhineland. But they were as nothing compared with the errors around Munich, where, in 1761/2, Cassini III measured a baseline and triangles to link up with a net run west from Vienna by Joseph Xaver Liesganig, S.J., the surveyor-general of the Holy Roman Empress. Later French sur veyors found that the angles in one of Cassini's Bavarian triangles summed to 190?.20 The remarkable account that Cassini wrote about his travels to the East makes his purposes as muddy as his measurements. The title states the purposes as determining the size of a degree of lati tude, mapping Germany, and finding the precise coordinates of the chief towns where astronomers had made observations. The preface gives determining the degree the first importance; the first pages of the work give military interest in cartography as the primary incen tive for the project and finding the coordinates of German 17.

Cassini left Paris on May 2, 1761 and made good speed follow ing his own map to Strasbourg. He then triangulated his way across Wittenberg, "where I was astonished to find roads as good as those in France," to arrive in Vienna 54 weeks after his departure. The emperor received him warmly, despite gloom cast by the poor weather, which threatened to hide the impending transit of Venus. Observing this rare event meant as much to fashionable women as to men, according to Cassini; "for in Vienna, as in all German 22 courts, science is not foreign to the fair sex." Heaven heard their prayers. "The clearness of the sky, and the brilliance of the stars attracted the gazes of the princes and princesses and I had the satis faction of hearing from the mother of the Elector, and the princesses, the names of the principal stars, which they know as well as the names of their courtiers." The main princelings of Southern Germany had a similar and equally unexpected knowledge of astronomy. The duke of Wittenberg claimed to be a disciple of Euler's; the Palatine Elector corresponded with French telescope makers; the Margrave of Baden-Domlac had all the latest maps, clocks, and instruments, "in a word, everything necessary to 23 cultivate astronomy." The Prince Bishop of Passau proved the most "enlightened and magnificent" of all. While trying to extend his triangles from Bavaria into Austria, Cassini ran into heavily wooded hills impossi ble to see through or over. He spied one a little higher than the rest, 21.

The hill belonged to the bishop. On learning Cassini's purpose (which one is not recorded), the bishop offered to fell 2000 trees, to open an unim peded view. Cassini refused so great a sacrifice. The bishop thereu pon built him an observatory on top of a tree 120 feet tall, large enough for the prince and his court to occupy while Cassini made his observations.24 Nothing could have been more accurate, in his opinion. The tri angles linking baselines in the Palatinate and near Munich gave cal culated values for the bases that differed from the measured ones by under one part in 7000. The 30 triangles linking Paris and Vienna made their separation 531,000 ts, which Cassini pointed out agreed precisely with expectation for a spherical earth with Picard's value for a degree of a great circle. (The arc of the great circle through Paris and Vienna subtends about 9? 18' at the earth's center.) Cassini confirmed this value by fireworks of a kind he had introduced in measurements made in France in the 1730s. A flash of gun powder set off in Paris at time tp was received in Vienna at time tv after transmission through 38 intervening stations. Let the arc of the great circle connecting the cities measure x?; the difference in time between them is x/15 hours. (Paris and Vienna are very nearly on the same circle of latitude; it takes the sun 24 hours to run around this circle of 360?, which makes 15? an hour.) Let the total delay in transmission be y hours. Then ty = tp + y +x/l5. Now reverse the process: t'p = t'v - x/15 + y, where t'p and ty are the times of arrival and departure of the signal at Paris and from Vienna, and, by hypothesis, the delay in transmit ting backwards equals that in transmitting forwards. Eliminating y, we have 2x/15 = (ty - tv) + (t 'v - t'), which provides x in terms of 25 measurable quantities. Cassini identified several sources of error in his measurements. Perhaps the most serious was that many of the church towers he used as sights did not have panoramic views; he could not always 24. Cassini de Thury, Relation (1765), xxiv-xxv, 76-77.

Laying out baselines also challenged accuracy; the sticks change length with temperature and it is easy to lose count of the number of times they are set down. The common peo ple watching Cassini's men place toise sticks carefully end to end 7344 times between Munich and Dachau thought him mad. To preserve him from their chafing and interference, his servant gave out that he was an old sinner come to seek penitence and a place to 26 build a hermitage. This bright idea did not help Cassini's posthumous reputation. The baron von Zach, a close student of Cassini's errors and innovations (Zach reintroduced the technique of determining differences in longitude by light flashes) and, as we know, a vigorous promoter of astronomy and geodesy in Germany, condemned the man who had raised the art of trigonometrical sur vey to national importance as immorally incompetent, "le vieux pecheur en geodesie."27 Zach's promotional methods and occasional plagiarisms earned him similar compliments from the congenial company of earth measurers. "No one knows better than Zach how to make the best use of his often modest knowledge and to impose on people who know little or nothing" (Laiern und Halbwissern).28 Enter the Army While the Cassinis mapped all France, the French Army was developing its skills by drawing up detailed topographical maps of fortifications, border areas, and likely battlefields. Most of the work was done by Ingenieurs geographes militaires, who traced their for mation as a special corps back to 1691; but not until the War of the Austrian Succession, when they had the challenge of surveying large tracts of German territory, improving German maps, and emu lating Cassini Ill's fateful exercises in Flanders, did these geographi cal engineers see geodesists and trigonometers in action.

During the Seven Years' War, the Corps produced as many maps as they had done in all previous engagements, with greater accuracy and in more detail. Peace again brought time to perfect technique, to triangulate more regions, and, where possible, to attach the detailed maps (often at 6 lignes to 100 toises) to the geodetic network under con struction by the Cassini corporation. For example, an important sur vey along the Rhine in Alsace in 1775-76, undertaken to detect meanderings of the river that might render defenses useless, rested on reference points attached to Cassini's triangles and a new base line of some 2,000 ts tied through a new trigonometric network to a 29 base measured out in 1743 under the aegis of the Paris Academy. During the late 1770s and the 1780s, the geographical engineers triangulated border strips in Provence and Dauphine, Alsace and Lorraine, Liege (with permission!), and the Pyrenees (in collabora tion with Spain). They also labored along the coasts of Normandy and Brittany, and throughout Corsica, where no fewer than three trigonometers and thirty-one geometers were employed under the general direction of Jean Joseph Tranchot, who would later dissem 30 inate French methods in the Germanies. The maps and plans linked to the triangulations were drawn at a scale six times larger than the second Cassini map and covered with topographical detail of military interest; severe penalties awaited anyone who disclosed 31 information about them to unauthorized parties. One piece of information that pride could not suppress was the discovery that the military trigonometers had surpassed their model: in many places, especially in Flanders and around Lille, they found that Cassini's engineers had set grid points with "absolute imperfec tion" and misplaced villages by significant distances. As the prestige of the Corps went up, the Cassini engineers tried to assimilate 29. Berthaut, Ing. geogr. (1902), 1, 13, 20-32, 37, 41, 45-46, 50, 57, 93, 119-120. 30.

When, as in the Alps in the late 1770s and Brittany in the 1780s, both sets of trigonometers meas ured the same ground simultaneously, one group sometimes mis took the other's signal towers for its own. Cooperation was there fore indicated, particularly to Cassini, who had fewer resources than the military. He requested that his men be given points established by the geographical engineers. The military declined, for security reasons. The officer in charge of the triangulation in the Dauphine put the point to his superiors with an unpleasantly modern ring. "The privilege given Cassini's engineers [to map France] should not include parts of the frontier, knowledge of which should be restricted_We note that the King of Sardinia has had the same survey done [on his side of the border]_He has locked up the result and permitted no publication because in his country an academic interest cannot gainsay a political and military one."32 The good and essential work of the Corps des ingenieurs geographes did not protect it from the politics of the Revolution. The regular engineers had already infringed on the independence of their more specialized brethren; in 1791 they convinced the Consti tuent Assembly to suppress the Corps altogether. It returned in 1793 when one of its former members, General Calon, who had become a Jacobin and a deputy, centralized the state's cartographi cal work in the Depot de la guerre and established a school there for surveyers, geometers, and engineers. On Calon's fall in 1797 the corps again disappeared as an independent entity?for two years. Resurrected once more, in 1799, as ingenieurs artistes, the geograph ical engineers (to use the name they regained in 1809) became a 33 principal instrument for the dissemination of French exact science. This promotion had two causes. For one, the conquests of the French Army delivered up many new territories for triangulation.

An export business The first major power outside France to feel the need for improved military maps was the diffuse Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1764 Field-Marshall Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, the first general to defeat Frederick the Great in battle, ordered geodetic operations throughout his Empress' dominions, "because [he said] during the Seven Years' War we had the sad experience of discover ing the unfortunate consequences that a lack of good maps [may have] on the most important military events." His most experienced colleague, Field-Marshall Franz Moritz Lacy, had complained about being stuck in unmapped woods within Austrian territory, unable to move his army safely, and about being quartered where no ade quate provisions existed. "It has often happened that the cavalry has been sent to villages without stables and the infantry to places with only wretched huts and no draft animals to haul forage and bread."35 Hands were available to correct the situation: Vienna had had a military engineering school since 1717 and its army had an engineering corps, which, in acknowledgment of French precedence, took the toise as its "Fortifikationsklafter," its fundamental unit of 36 measurement and construction. The joint operations of Cassini III and Liesganig between Strasbourg and Vienna in the early 1760s gave the Austrians an example of the method, if not of the preci sion, of large-scale trigonometric surveys; and between Daun's call and the end of the century, when the French engineer geographers irrupted into the Germanies, several indigenous geodetic mappings took place. Austrian engineers did all or parts of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia in 1768; Galicia, acquired by the first partition of Poland (by Liesganig, who had risen to the status of Geniebau- und Navigations-Direktor) beginning in 1773; and Bukovina, Austria, Slavonia, Croatia, and Hungary in the 1780s.

The survey work, accomplished mostly with the planchette, compass, and chain, without a general triangulation and without connection to Liesganig's meridian through Vienna, varied in method and quality from region to region. Much was done by pacing out distances on foot or horse; "use a quiet animal," the directions to the surveyors ran, and bring a billiard ball, "to test whether the planchette is horizontal." The resulting maps, drawn at three times the scale of Cassini's and never printed, were held in the deepest secrecy. The whole had to 37 be redone, beginning in 1806, with French methods. The best and best known of the works initiated by Daun's call was the mapping of the Spanish Netherlands between 1771 and 1777 by General Joseph Johann von Ferraris, a graduate of the imperial military academy. The project compiled 4,000 pages of inventory of everything in Belgium of military interest?mills, mines, minerals, fodder, coal, quarries, buildings, populations. Unfor tunately for Belgium, its population density easily met the condition for supporting advancing armies: at least 35 people per square 38 kilometer for an army of 60,000 men. Despite the scale of his operations, however, Ferraris did not establish a primary triangular grid, but anchored a system of secondary triangles to some 30 points fixed by Cassinis men around Dunkirk. Ferraris discussed the project with Cassini, "known in Vienna by the astronomical and trigonometrical operations he ran from the banks of the Rhine to the capital of Austria," and apparently received the assurance that he could refer his positions confidently to the grid formed by the Paris meridian and the triangulated perpendicular to it. Ferraris accordingly tied secondary triangles taken graphically?with the planchette?to the Cassini points in Flanders and converted dis tances on the ground to latitude and longitude with respect to the 39 meridian and parallel of Paris. 37.

When the Ferraris map, engraved in 270 large sheets at 1:11,520 as a "carte de cabinet" (for government and mili tary use) was published at the Cassini scale of 1:86,400, exacting astronomers depreciated it as "disjunct from observations, without direction, [and] off by 2 or 3 leagues [1 league = 2000 ts] from Cassinis observations, which, however, are not the finest [either]." Nonetheless, the French military much prized Ferrari's printed map when, in 1793, the Spanish Netherlands again became a theater of war.40 The French Army seized all copies it could locate and took the printing plates, which it corrected and used to issue new edi tions for the use of its officers. Among the provisions of the Peace of Vienna was the restitution of the purloined plates.41 In the Germanies, several mappings at 1:86,400 were attempted between the Seven Years' War and the arrival of the French in Napoleonic times. At the beginning of the period, between 1764 and 1770, a former ingenieur geographe named Michel, who had transferred his expertise to the Electoral court in Munich, surveyed Bavaria. At the end, in 1795, Johann Gottlieb Freidrich von Bohnen berger, a former student of theology turned astronomer by Zach and, later, a professor at the University of T?bingen, and Carl Ludwig von Lecoq, a general in the Prussian Army, started triangu lated surveys in W?rttemberg along the truce line from the Nether lands to the Ruhr established by the Peace of Basel. Bohnenberger's work was slow, academic, and exact; Lecoq's was fast (he had 24 Prussian officers at his command), practical (he omitted everything without military significance), and sloppy (his officers did not always measure all three angles in their triangles and, when they did, they sometimes achieved closing errors of 2 minutes of arc).42 They had a 10-inch Ramsden sextant, with which they should have done better.43 40.

In 1775 his son and heir, Jean Dominique Cassini, on a visit in Florence, tried to interest the Grand Duke in a triangulated survey of Tuscany, to be conducted by the latest sprig of the Cassini tree in person. Several Tuscan administrations had flirted with the project since the mid 1750s, when the lamp of Florentine exact science, Leonardo Ximenes, inspired by the work of his fellow Jesuits Boscovich and Maire, first proposed it. Cassini IV received sufficient encourage ment to draw up plans?he would need instruments from London and Paris, mathematicians as assistants, 10 horses, and 40 mules. The Grand Duke referred the plan to competent advisers, who recommended the project but saw no reason that it should not be directed by Italians; as Ximenes, then risen to grand-ducal mathematician, put the point, referring to surveys by the French that will be described momentarily, "your subjects are not Ameri cans, Lapps, or Africans, to need foreign astronomers to draw up a map and to measure a degree of a meridian." Ximenes recom mended not only a map of Cassini's style, but also an inventory like Ferraris'; the project grew too large for so small a state, and was postponed for some forty years.44 The cross-channel link The Cassinis' second initiative on the periphery enjoyed immedi ate success. Early in October 1783, a month after the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles between Great Britain and the United States, Cassini de Thury proposed to the Royal Society of London a joint exercise that he had drafted in 1775?to determine the differences in latitude and longitude between the national observa tories in Paris and Greenwich. Cassini claimed that the uncertainty in separation in longitude, AL, amounted to 11 seconds of time; the corresponding quantity in latitude, AX, he estimated at 15 seconds of arc. Privately he insinuated that 12 of the 15 seconds derived the measurements made with the sextant but condemned the chronometer, with which longitudes were taken, as poor and cheap ("it cost only 60 pounds"). 44.

The English on their side doubted that French instruments could perform to British stan dards.45 During these preliminary skirmishes, the president of the Royal Society, Joseph Banks, replied to Cassini that the Society would take care of operations on its side of the Channel and handed the matter to his lieutenant, Joseph Blagden, an old Paris hand. Blagden asked the opinions of Henry Cavendish, Alexandre Aubert, and Alexander Dalrymple, an Army surveyor eager to map the coasts of England on French principles; none of them could understand the allegation of the error in the estimate of the latitude of Greenwich by the royal astronomers of Britain, but all agreed that the project should go forward.46 Blagden had doubts, however, about the powers of the Frenchmen with whom the Society would have to deal. "Fre quent conversations with Mr Cassini the elder [Cassini de Thury] whilst I was in Paris convinced me that he is a man of very moderate intellect." Blagden rated Cassini IV a little higher as an observer, but still not an Englishman. "Yet the scheme must be executed.. .notwithstanding all the difficulties which I foresee will attend the choice of persons."47 In addition to promoting national honor and promising precision in AL and AX, the project had the merit of fitting perfectly into the development of British cartography. Before 1745 few good maps of any part of Britain existed, a fact made clearly and cruelly evident to the British Army during the Scottish rebellion that year. To ease its way in Scotland should its services again be required, the Army commissioned a military map and survey of the Highlands.

A quar ter century later about half of Britain had been mapped at a scale of an inch to a mile; but, like the contemporary survey in Austria, the maps of various localities were constructed on different principles and with varying accuracy, and no triangulated grid existed to integrate or assemble them. Roy had tri?d to create such a back bone. Again like the Austrians, he seized the opportunity of the end of the Seven Years' War to push his project. Nothing was decided before the American Revolution absorbed military attention. Roy pushed again after the Peace of Versailles, just when the French proposed the linking of observatories.48 Roy began work in 1784, laying out baselines at Hounslow Heath west of London and Romney Marsh near the Dover Coast, and advertising completion of the project by 1786. He measured the base over and over again, with instruments made by Ramsden: a surveyor's chain, wooden poles, and glass rods. Much to Roy's irri tation, Ramsden did not finish the famous theodolite for angular measure early enough to enable Roy to conclude the project before 1788; perhaps one cause of delay was dealing with Cassini IV, who came to London to try to entice Ramsden to France, or, failing that, to place French apprentices with him. Cassini managed only to cap ture a Hugenot lens maker and to commission a quadrant.49 The big theodolite came into action on the last day of July 1787 (figure 4.1.1). Roy took as many sights in the field as possible before moving the instrument to Dover in its four-horse carriage, provided by Banks "with his usual liberality." At Dover, in September, Roy, Blagden, Cassini, Legendre, and Mechain drew up final plans for the cross-channel link, "thereby to establish for ever, the triangular connection between the two countries." The very bad weather relented for a few clear nights; the great theodolite zeroed in on French lights at Cap Blanc Nez and Montlambert, while the French at Calais sighted on flares at Dover furnished by the Woolwich arsenal. The resultant values for AL and AX would have been truer 48. Close, Early years (1969), 4, 7-8; Wallis, in Cart.

Using the triangles and the Hounslow base, and sighting on the lights from France, he made the Dunkirk base to be 6225.4 ts. The French got 6225.6 ts. With the Romney base, Dunkirk's came out three feet half a toise?off.51 As for the values sought at the outset, they agreed well with estimates Maskelyne had made while the work was in progress: AX ? 2?38'26", making the error originally claimed by Cassini sink close to the 4".5 initially estimated by Maskelyne; and AL = 9ml9.45s, according to Roy's geodetic measurement, less than a second different from the value Bradley had found from observing Jupiter's moons and Maskelyne obtained during the course of the project by sending an assistant to Paris with a few good chronometers ticking Greenwich time. Maskelyne came closer, according to modern determinations, despite Roy's belief that "the trigonometrical operations.. .may be considered as infallible." The modern result may suggest that the squabble among Roy, Maskelyne, and Ramsden over who was the finest measurer of his 52 time should be settled in Maskelyne's favor. The project to link the observatories of Greenwich and Paris had at least two slight but interesting, and one important outcome.

Tranchot thought 53 it "magnificent" when he encountered it in Bern in 1812. He was assisted by Ferdinand Hassler, who had worked with Zach, to whom he recommended himself by arriving at Gotha with an English sextant. This training helped Hassler to win the confidence of Thomas Jefferson and to set up, after many vicissitudes, a land survey in the best European style in the United States.54 The second slight spin-off from the measurements of 1787 came in 1803, when Napoleon took it into his head to view the invasion of England he was planning from the comfort of the French coast. How high above sea level would he have to stand to see the tide arrive in Dover? He addressed the question to the First Class of the Institute, which assigned it to Delambre. He calculated the requested height as a function of distance and atmospheric refrac tion; plugging in distances derived from the Roy-Cassini link, Delambre concluded that no suitable height existed near Calais or Dunkirk, but that Cap Blanc Nez would do nicely.55 As it hap pened, Napoleon had no use for this information. The most important consequence of the Paris-Greenwich project was the definitive establishment of the British Ordnance Survey. Sometime between 1785 and 1790 the Royal Society drew up a plan for a large trigonometric survey of Britain, at a scale of 2 inches to a mile; the Master of Ordnance, the Duke of Richmond, an enthusiastic cartographer, supported the general idea; and in 1791 the Ordnance Survey began, the first military organization in the world to enter wholeheartedly into trigonometric surveying.56 The timing owed something to Ramsden's completion of a second large theodolite, commissioned by Richmond in 1790.

The result: Roy's errors and oversights did not amount to more than 5 or 6 feet in 27 miles. The new surveyors per petuated their work in an appropriately military manner by replac ing the pipes Roy had used to mark the ends of the base at Hounslow Heath with cannons sunk muzzle up. In a more delicate mood, they worried when their triangles failed to close within a quarter of an arc-second.57 The Ordnance Survey continued around the British Isles beginning with the coastline; it reached Cornwall before the end of the century with the help of still another Ramsden theodolite, about half the size, and almost as good, as the bigger ones. The methods of the survey were soon in use elsewhere in the British Empire, particularly in India, where work with Ramsden instruments began just after the turn of the century, and some distinguished geodecists, for example Henry Kater, received their training.58 Imperial measures In competitive geodesy, Britain could not approach France.

As Biot rightly said, "it is the war that.. .gave geodetic operations the great extention and extreme perfection they have acquired in all the states of Europe."61 The Dutch survey began tentatively when the French appointed a physician with the resounding name of Cornelius Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff as military commander of Amsterdam when they took the city in 1795. No good map then existed for dividing up the Netherlands into departments on the French model. Kray enhoff was ordered to prepare one. He measured out a base line with an ordinary surveyor's chain on the frozen Zuider Zee and took his angles with a standard sextant. By 1800 he had finished. He showed his results to J.H. van Swinden, one of Holland's most distinguished natural philosophers. Van Swinden severely criticized his countryman for using old crude methods when a new French technique was only too much in evidence. Krayenhoff took the point. "I saw with regret that such an imperfect execution would give an unfavorable impression of the state of science in Holland and would compromise the fame of our nation in the domain of mathematics, astronomy, and geography." He thereby echoed the call to emulation that Roy had sounded with English understate ment ("The honour of the nation is concerned in having at least as good a map of this as there is of any other country") and Zach had tooted with Hungarian enthusiasm ("I received your letter, and read in it those magic words, that you implore me, for the glory of the fatherland, to send you a sextant for the advancement of our national geography"). In 1801 Krayenhoff began anew. Using a large Borda circle made by Lenoir, he revealed errors in the extension of Cassini's grid into Belgium committed by a French astronomer, Perny de Villeneuve, and attached his triangles instead to Delambre's more southerly, but more correct, stations. Later, on a commission from the French min ister of war, he triangulated through East Friesland to link up with a net in Hanover completed by a French geographical engineer, 60. Schmidt, Kartenauf.

Epailly had proceeded in truly imperial style, with a crowd of officers and horses, and with no patience with peasants. "To keep up with the reconnaissance of triangles, the placing and raising of signals, and the observation of angles," he wrote his superiors, "it was necessary despite the outcries and complaints of the peasants to cut down their trees mercilessly, to knock holes in their church steeples.. .to enjoy everywhere the right of conquest and to ignore altogether refusal and resistance." In attempting to emulate the French, and to satisfy the cultural chauvinism of van Swinden, Krayenhoff allowed himself liberties with the data if not with the peasants. Perhaps van Swinden helped in tidying up. Krayenhoff sent him the raw data before publication with an invita tion to make it sum to a conclusion of Parisian clarity. "I.. .submit these operations without withholding the smallest detail or arbitrary arrangement respectfully to your judgment as a university professor in order to make a statement as sharp as those given about the observations of the French astronomers." It appears that Krayenhoff's closing errors, claimed to be under one second, had a standard deviation of about 4 seconds. He also made errors in com 63 putation undetected by the university professor. In contrast to the Dutch survey directed by a Quisling doctor who learned on the job, the triangulation of the new departments on the left bank of the Rhine was conducted by one of the most experienced of French ^geographical engineers, Tranchot of the Cor sican survey, whom Napoleon chose for the job over Delambre. Since the triumph in Corsica, Tranchot had worked on the resurvey of the Paris meridian run during the French Revolution. He had the technical but not the administrative experience required. Although Napoleon supported the work spiritually, and prescribed a fine for anyone who interefered with the survey, the Army, feeling the pinch of a decade of constant war, could not keep up with Tranchot's requirements of men and material. The survey, begun enthusiastically in 1801 as a continuation of Cassini's map beyond Dunkirk, stopped at least twice for lack of funds.

They ordinarily made three series of observations of every angle, and sometimes as many as six, each series requiring a dozen or more repetitions. Sometimes the sightings were made from scaffolds built for the purpose, and torn down immediately by local citizens for firewood, construction lumber, and indemnity for cut ting trees to make the scaffolds; but more often from the old standby, the church steeple. In an instructive reversal of the usual military connection, the administration of the cathedral of Cologne argued successfully that the Prussian government should pay for the repair of lightning damage to one of the towers because it was essential to astronomical and geodetic work. The meticulous repeti tions from scaffolds and steeples produced a set of Rhineland maps probably superior to anything the French had for, metropolitan France, "the most beautiful topographical work of the time."64 Owing to the vacillating material support, Tranchot had com pleted the primary triangles, but not the full survey, by its discon tinuance in 1814. The 1625 square leagues (about 26000 km2) he had surveyed represented 150 man-years of work. Three more years of work remained. Napoleon grew very impatient, but to no avail; Tranchot would not finish by Waterloo. The peace treaty of 1815 awarded all the maps of Germany Tranchot had completed to Prus sia as war spoil. The French copied them before delivery to the Ger man governor of Paris, Friedrich Carl Ferdinand von M?ffling, who happened to know something about map making. M?ffling had learned surveying on the job, under Lecoq, in 1796. Thus armed, he became Zach's lieutenant in a survey of Thuringia begun in 1802, on commission from the King of Prussia, who wanted military maps of newly acquired territory. The survey had a Borda circle, Zach's favorite sextants and chronometers, and a clutch of mathematicians. In measuring the base, Zach arranged the rods, which he calibrated from a copy of a French standard (the toise de Perou), so that one served as a nonius for the next. He marked the ends of the base most appropriately with sunken cannon barrels. Frequent measure ment of temperature permitted appropriate compensation.65 All this 64. Berthaut, Ing. geogr.

"Experience has taught us that with careful, twenty-fold multiplication [of observa tions with a Borda circle], the three angles of a triangle can close to within a second." When he came to write instructions for finishing Tranchot's work, he required that his men discard all triangles that did not close to under three seconds.66 Other notable German developments stimulated by French exam ples were the measurement of a base near Damstadt in 1808 by a Hessian civil servant, C.L.P. Eckhardt, and a mathematician, L.S. Schleiermacher, who aimed to link the observatories of Seeberg and Mannheim. They followed methods similar to those Zach pioneered in Thuringia. The Darmstadt base was tied to Tranchot's triangles in 1809. Eckhardt joined the French project. "I acknowedge gratefully [he wrote in 1835] that I thereby first had the opportunity to be ini tiated into the mysteries of the finer art of observation with tran 67 sportable instruments." Similar experience came to J.G. S?ldner, who continued from 1808 to 1818 the triangulation of Bavaria begun by the French in 1801 with links to Cassini's old Paris Vienna line and continued, with the collaboration of the Bavarian cartographic service and several Borda circles, until war forced a parting in 1805.68 C.F. Gauss worked with Zach in Thuringia before observing the gentle operations of Epailly in Hanover in 1805. Gauss came to French-style geodesy from a compulsion to extract the most likely value of a quantity from several measurements of it. In 1794, at the age of 17, he made Zach a present of a reduction of some very old data?Ulugh Beg's, from the 15th century?by the method of least squares, which he, Gauss, had just invented.

In 1799, with support from Lecoq, whom he had helped with the mathematics of exact geodesy, Gauss asked Zach for permission to come to study astronomy in Gotha. He received a mixed message in reply: advice to give up astronomical observing (Gauss had notoriously poor eyesight) and a sextant to practice making observa tions.69 In 1803, Gauss heard that the King of Prussia had engaged Zach to survey Thuringia. He renewed his request, excited by the news that Zach would exploit the latest methods. "Zach took on the assignment only on the condition that the measurement would be done in such a way that, at least, it would rival the latest French and English surveys."70 Gauss participated in the work, from 1803 to 1805, and learned to measure baselines, take angles, and deter mine differences in longitude by shooting off gunpowder. In 1805 Gauss met with Epailly and examined the French instruments used on the survey of Hanover; and he gained access to the data von M?ffling had obtained while working with Lecoq. The information provided the basis of many evenings' amusement. As Gauss wrote later, "I can always get something interesting from many tri gonometrical measurements, since their daily reduction always gives me some entertainment_To God, it is all the same whether we have determined the place of a church tower to a foot or of a star 71 to the second."

A disciple of Gauss', H.C. Schumacher, who became professor of physics in Copenhagen in 1815 and head of a tri gonometrical survey of Denmark, used instruments furnished by Georg von Reichenbach, who had worked in London with Ramsden's dividing engine and returned to better it in Munich. After using a Reichenbach repeater in 1809, Zach declared it "a marvel, surpassing] in accuracy, convenience, and even in beauty 73 the best I've known made in Paris or London." Gauss prized Reichenbach's instruments in his survey of Hanover, which improved materially on Epailly's measurement. And when Gauss needed an instrument maker to manufacture his own important contribution to geodetic apparatus, the "heliotrope," he turned to a German workshop.74 The heliotrope, which furnished a reflection of the sun in place of a signal tower or church steeple as a foresight, was, in von M?ffling's words, a god-send. Among other benefits, it made possi ble a survey through thick woods in Hanover that Epailly had regarded as impassable, since no signals could be seen through the trees. Gauss calculated carefully the direction from a low-lying sta tion to a relative height, hewed down a line of trees, placed a heliotrope at the end of the alley, and observed without difficulty, 75 at distances of up to nine miles, the reflected image of the sun. Gauss reckoned that he and his colleagues greatly excelled their models. "Delambre's and Krayenhoff's measurements, I think, can 76 not be compared with ours for exactness." 2.

Newton knew that gravity allowed the earth to have the profile of a pumpkin and he observed that the tropical lethargy of pendulum clocks, as discovered by Jean Richer, required it. And more than that: Newton deduced the excess of the equatorial over the polar diameter from the mechanics of gravitating bodies and from a 77 fiction about canals running to the center of the earth. Newton's apple In figure 4.2.1, the canals AC and CQ, filled with a fluid of unit density, reach to the surface at A on the equator and Q at the pole. In order that a particle of the fluid at C be in equilibrium, it must be subject to equal pressures from the two canals. Newton's calculation of these pressures was a tour-de-force. Consider first the gravita tional acceleration /q existing at Q and caused by the oblate spheroid formed by rotation of the ellipse AQB around the axis CQ. Evidently, /q = f (b)+fexc, where f (b) is the acceleration of gravity at the surface of a uniform sphere of radius b = CQ and /exc is the acceleration deriving from the excess material contained between the oblatum AQB and the sphere CQ. If p0 denote the average den sity of the earth, we have /(M = (4/3)7rb3PoG/b2 = MPo^ where G is the gravitational constant and p is shorthand for (4/3)7rG. An analytic paraphrase of Newton's derivation of /exc 78 might run as follows. The acceleration at Q along QC arising from the element of volume dv = dx-xd^-dz (0 is the azimuth around QC) is dfexc = (Gp0/r2)cosd'xdxd(f)dz. To obtain /exc, integrate &lt;/&gt; from 0 to 27r, x from xc (its value at the circle of radius b) to xe (its value at the ellipse QA), and z from -b to b, as indicated in figure 4.2.2: 77.

Hence /A' lies about midway between fA and f(a). Newton accordingly took f a = MPofl(l~2e/5): the acceleration at A on the oblate spheroid, the one of practical interest, is the same as that at the surface of a sphere of radius a and density pa = p0(l-2e/5).

Hence, pAC = (?p0a2)(l-2e/5 - (jo2/hp0). Equilibrium requires a2(l-2e/5-co2/MPo) = b2(l+4e/5); or, since a2/b 2~l + 2e, and co2/^p0, the ratio of the centrifugal to the gravitational force at the surface, is a small quantity, 4e/5 = co2/^p0. From the value of the acceleration of gravity as measured at Paris, Newton calculated that co//*p0 = 1/289. Hence, in Newton's 79 rounded value, e = 1/230. "And since the mean semidiameter of the earth, according to Picard's mensuration, is 19615800 Paris feet, or 3923.16 miles (reckoning 5000 feet to a mile), the earth will be higher at the equator than at the poles by 85472 feet, or 17 [and] 1/10 miles."80 Neither the over-precision of theory, nor the under-precision of measurement, nor their conflict aroused much interest at first. Newton did not mention Jacques Cassini's challenge in the edition of the Principia (the third) that appeared late enough to take it into account. Cassini's mathematician colleagues in the Paris Academy had not yet?it was the 1720s?discovered the power or felt the prestige of computing via the gravitational theory. The main defense of the oblate earth was entrusted to John Theodore Desagu liers, paladin of Newtonian science and demonstrator of experi ments to the Royal Society of London. Desaguliers rejected Cassini's conclusions as having no basis in fact (they supposed an accuracy three to six times finer than the measurements) or theory (they flew against Newton's gravity, in which "no Body had yet been able to shew any Flaw"). Moreover, they were easily refuted, thus. Take 79. Proceeding as ever by proportion, Newton worked with a fictitious sphere for which e = 0.01. In this case, f/fA = (101/100)(126/125)(126/125.5)-501/500, and the ratio of the pressures, without reference to the centrifugal force, is p' / P'cq = afA/bf0 = 505/501. To reduce 505 to 501, the centrifugal force must take off 4 parts in 500, that is, o&gt;2/mp0 = 4/500 = (4/5)e. 80. Principia, ed.

Poleni recommended measuring arcs along parallels of latitude rather than arcs along meridians of longitude.84 The procedure had the advantage that, for the same triangulated distance, the latitude measurement would show a greater difference between the oblatum and the sphere containing it than the longitude measurement. The truth of this unlikely proposition may be gathered from figure 4.2.3; from y' = tan0, 6 = 7r/2 + X, and the equation of the ellipse, we have x = fl(b2tan2X/fl2+l)-1/2~flcosX(l + esin2X). (4.2.4) At the latitude of Paris, the difference between a degree of the meridian on Newton's oblatum and one on Picard's sphere is Along = (27r/360)(r(48.83?)-fl) = -74 ts; whereas the difference per degree of longitude is Aiat = (27r/360)flecosXsin2X = 93 ts. The latitudinal arc from St Malo to Nancy subtends about the same angle as the longitudinal arc from Dunkirk to Perpignan, although it includes only two-thirds the distance on the ground; and yet, over these equal arcs of 8.5?, the difference between Newton's earth and Picard's is about the same whether taken in latitude or longitude (Alat/Along = 0.9). A perhaps more persuasive consideration, which Godin developed, compared the Alat between Newton's earth and Cassini's. On the first hypothesis, e = 1/230, a = 3.276 million ts, a&gt;b; on the second, e = 1/95, a = 3.255 million ts, a&lt;b; on the 85 Paris parallel, A = 550 ts/degree. The resumption of the mapping of France during 1733 gave an opportunity to put Poleni's proposal into practice. Jacques Cassini's analysis of the numbers he and his son obtained along the Paris parallel confirmed the family's prolate planet; the academicians' 84.

The difficulty lay in the determination of longitude by eclipses of Jupiter's moons. The art did not give the arc to sufficient accuracy to discover the earth's profile.86 Once again it appeared that the answer demanded uncomfortable travel. This time, however, sufficient interest had developed to procure the funds and find the men for the undertaking. In June 1733, while Jacques Cassini triangulated his way to Strasbourg, some of his younger colleagues, concerned about the Academy's reputation and ambitious for their own, proposed to measure a meridian at the equator. The following year, to lengthen the basis of comparison and to avoid reliance on Picard and Cassini, the Academy resolved 87 to send an expedition to the Arctic Circle. Elusive ellipticity The French expeditions of the 1730s are among the great adven tures of civilized men. In the North, the surveyors, led by Mauper tuis, braved freezing cold, glaciers, and mosquitoes; in the South, under the direction of Godin, Bouguer, and La Condamine, they faced fearsome heat, withering cold, high winds, huge mountains, and mosquitoes; in both, constant danger; and all to learn whether a degree of longitude contains a few more feet in Lapland than in Peru. Overall, the northerners had the better of it, despite the man-eating gnats. They had a frozen river on which to lay out a base line, a Graham sector to take latitudes, six stout soldiers and fifteen boats to carry their instruments, and a way of working that avoided fights; they returned to Paris in 1737, after an absence of sixteen months, with a measurement that, as Voltaire put it, "simul 88 taneously flattened the poles and the Cassinis." 86.

Lemonnier, and Anders Celsius, Maupertuis' expedi tion did not arrive at an accurate figure. Clairaut and Maupertuis had had little previous experience in astronomical observations, apart from a little practice at Thury in the autumn of 1735, under the guidance of the man whose measurements they were trying to 89 discredit. The best value derived by the northern expedition, 57,438 ts/degree, was out by over 200 ts, according to measure ments made early in the 19th century by Jons Svandberg, who imported a Borda circle from Paris for his purpose. The academi cians may have erred by some 12 seconds in their latitude determi nations, which made about 190 ts on a spherical earth of Picard's size; had the instrumental (or observational) error gone the other way, it would have swamped the effect Maupertuis sought (at X = 66?, a degree of Newtonian meridian should be 125 ts bigger than one on a Picard sphere), and confirmed Cassini. The academicians further enlarged their result by failing to take into account the shrinkage of their toise sticks in the extreme cold. Combining his mistakenly large value for the Arctic degree with Picard's value for one around the latitude of Paris, Maupertuis deduced from equation (4.2.3) that e=l/121, a = Newton's (3.27 million ts).90 And that amount of flatness, as he wrote James Bradley, "appears even more considerable than Sir Isaac Newton thought it." The result delighted Maupertuis, who wanted a decisive qualitative outcome, and did not concern himself overly with precision. As he had written Johann I Bernoulli just before setting off, "we will never have the earth's dimensions to the utmost exactness and I think that it will be enough for its inhabitants to know its size in general and that it is elongated or flattened and approximately the limits of its shape." His one-time instructor Cassini, caught up in technicalities, insisted instead on instrumental difficulties that vitiated the result.

Among the many causes of delay were the weather, which during the winter sometimes permitted only 15 minutes of observations a month; the fatigue and discomfort of life in rude huts at the various stations; the hostility of the Indians, who deduced that men so engaged must be lunatics, criminals, or sorcer ers; the unfriendliness of the Spanish viceroy; the difficulty of tran sporting delicate instruments up great mountains on mule back; the constant shaking from earthquakes; and antipathy among the French leaders of the expedition, Godin, Bouguer, and La Condam 92 ine. There were rumors of another reason as well. "Mr Short [the telescope maker James Short] writes that an unlucky accident has happened to the French Mathematicians in Peru. It seems they were shewing some French gallantry to the natives' wives, who [the natives, apparently] have murdered their servants, destroyed their Instruments &amp; burnt their papers, the Gentlemen escaping narrowly 93 themselves." Nonetheless the final results of the Peruvian gallants agreed well among themselves and with later determinations: one baseline, measured twice by different subparties in 25 days of heavy work, came to 6272.74 and 6272.69 ts, or a precision of one part in 150,000; the second baseline, corrected for temperature expansion of the toise sticks, came to 5258.90 and 5258.95 ts; the degree of arc fell out as 56,750 according to Bouguer and La Condamine, and 56,768 according to Godin and Jorge Juan, a Spanish naval officer attached to the expedition. To acquire these numbers from the observations many tedious adjustments were required, for aberra tion, nutation, precession, and refraction, for example, and also for the effects of temperature on the instruments, the deviation of the sums of the angles (each of which had a likely error of 20 seconds not clear where Maupertuis' error lay; Olbers to Gauss, 9 Feb 1821, in Schilling, Olbers (1900), 2:2, 66; Zach, Memoire (1811), 15-16; Jahn, Gesch.

No doubt the calculations and extensive checking of instruments provided welcome employment on the windswept deserts when observations could not be made. Combined with the result of the Northern expedition, the aver age Peruvian degree of 56,759 ts implied an oblate spheroid with equatorial radius a = 3,271,652 ts and an ellipticity e = 1/310. (Combined with Picard's measure, e = 1/315.) The slight difference between these values and Newton's (a = 3,276,433 ts, e = 1/230) did not at first appear to be significant. French brains and bravado had demonstrated the truth that English lethargy had only guessed. Voltaire again: "Heros of physics, Argonauts of our time/who leaped the mountains, who crossed the seas... You have confirmed in uncomfortable places/What Newton knew without leaving his study."95 Picard had known nothing about aberration and nutation, although he had noticed changes in positions of his reference stars that derived from aberration. Maupertuis came after Bradley's discoveries, for which he corrected the Lapland observations and also Picard's. That reduced the length of the Paris degree from 57,060 ts to 56,925 ts, which, when combined with the Arctic degree, gave e = 1/174; little different, according to d'Alembert's 96 conception of error, from Newton's 1/230. Still, the discrepancy amounted to a difference of six English miles in the length of the polar axis, which might be thought considerable. Therefore in 1740, before the results from the Peru expedition were known, the French redid Picard's arc and baseline; they thought it easier than repeating the Arctic expedition, whose result, in any case, they assumed to be more reliable than the measurements made by Picard and Cassini. Cassini himself (Jacques Cassini, Cassini II) recognized that he had been sloppy, especially in the mountainous southern reaches, where 94.

He arranged to have his son placed in charge of the measurement; but Cassini III was busy mapping France, and did little more than put his name on the title page of the final report. The work fell to a scrupulous observer, the abbe Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille. The report ascribed Cassini IFs failings to his three-foot quadrant, which was awkward to employ in church towers and had no micrometers on its lenses. To correct these faults, the new expedition used a two-foot quadrant fitted with micrometers for the triangulations and a six-foot sector to take the 97 height of stars. Lacaille began measuring in June 1739, redoing the old triangles where they sufficed?when they contained no angle less than thirty degrees and when all angles could be separately determined?and devising new ones when they did not. He spun beautiful new trian gles across the Auvergne during the severe winter of 1739/40; he laid out his own baselines north and south; he and Cassini de Thury redid Picard's base at Amiens, and found it off by six toises, or one part in a thousand, an act of impiety that, according to Cas sini, met strong opposition. They observed the thermometer regu larly, but made no corrections for temperature, deeming them unnecessary. Finally, taking everything together, after two years' hard work, Lacaille confirmed that degrees of latitude in France behaved for the most part like degrees elsewhere and increased 98 toward the pole. Unhappily, the new value for a degree around Paris did not improve the fit: Lacaille and Cassini de Thury got 57,183 ts, which, on remeasuring Picard's base, they made 57,074 ts. The larger figure agreed fairly well with Lapland and Newton, and with the flattening of e = 1/215 obtained from combining the Arctic and the Equatorial degree, but the smaller and supposedly better figure, 57,074 ts, could not be reconciled with the others." 97.

The Academy named commission ers to reconcile the several measurements of the distance between Paris and Amiens. Bouguer informed a government minister that the commissioners had declared in public that they could reach no firm decision. "Is it not astonishing that we fancy that we know the lengths of a degree fairly well in various places on the globe, and that we do not have the same advantage for the environs of Paris? It is worthy of you, Sir, to provide for the definitive solution of this question." The resultant inquiry confirmed Lacaille's Paris degree of 57,074 ts.100 At this point the distressing possibility that the earth might not be an ellipsoid of revolution began to gain currency. Already in 1736 a resourceful Biblischer Mathematicus had seized upon the disagreement about the shape of the earth as a confirmation of scripture. "Hast thou surveyed unto the ends of the earth?" God asked Job. "Declare if thou knowest it all."101 La Condamine ack nowledged in 1746 that it might not be possible to know the earth's shape, if it has one; and the busy Jesuit mathematician Roger Bosco vich took it for granted, when he started to promote geodetic sur veys around 1750, that only God had an intuition of the true figure of our globe.102 His vicar, Benedict XIV, commissioned Boscovich to run a meridian line from Rome to Rimini, and, while about it, to map the Papal States. It was a perfect opportunity for the skeptical geodesist. The Rome-Rimini arc had about the same average lati tude as the Cassinis' line from Dunkirk to Perpignan; it would therefore allow a test whether at the same latitudes the length of a degree along all meridians is the same. Boscovich expected the test 100. Delambre, Grandeur (1912), 72-81, 143-145; Todhunter, History (1873), 1, 355-356; Levallois, in Lacombe and Costabel, Figure (1988), 67-73. 101. Schmidt, Bibl. Mat.

He obtained the collaboration of a Jesuit colleague, Christopher Maire, a good astronomer with a taste for geography, "and, moreover, healthy enough to withstand the fatigue of travel."103 Boscovich and Maire started their work in rains the like of which had not been seen since the time of Noah. The Tiber flooded Rome twice. On the road, they narrowly escaped death by drowning, slip ping, and sliding. Twice marooned in villages, they improved their time by preaching, "thinking we could fill the void in our geometri cal occupations in no better way than by works of zeal." They were attacked by dogs and, worse, by peasants, who knew that no one could be idiot enough to do what Boscovich and Maire claimed to be doing; it followed that the Jesuits must be looking for buried treasure, guarded by hydraulic spirits. Reasoning thus, and needing nails, the peasants tore down the signal towers that Boscovich and Maire had built on the summits of the Apennines. The French translator of the report of the expedition, which Boscovich and Maire drew up in Latin, was astonished. "Who could have believed that there would be so strong a resemblance between the peasants of the Apennines and the Indians of the mountains of Quito?"104 Boscovich and Maire measured in the same way the French did, using instruments produced for them, after much delay, by a Father Rufo, who had built up the collection of mechanical models at the Gregorian College, but had never seen a zenith sector. Using old ship masts as rulers, they laid out baselines of about 12 kilometers along the Appian way and on the beach near Rimini; they set masts with small gaps in between, which they measured with dividers, so as to avoid inadvertent displacements; two measurements of the base differed from one another by one part in 1/72 ts in over 6037 ts, and by a 19th-century remeasurement by 28 cm in over 3000 meters. They anchored their angles more accurately than the French had done in Lapland; they determined the number of toises in their ship masts from a standard sent from Paris; and they ended with a 103.

Boscovich took this discrepancy to confirm his expectations. "Look where you will/' he wrote, "you will see nothing regular, nothing fixed or constant."106 Boscovich's result challenged not only previous assumptions but previous measurements. If it held up, d'Alembert wrote, "all efforts made so far to determine the figure of the earth will be a total loss." For his part, he hoped that the Jesuitical degree would fail and that a planned measurement in France would confirm 57,183 ts against the objectionable 57,074 ts. Everything depended on measurements at the very edge of attainable accuracy. "What observer will guaran tee [his work] to two seconds? Those who are the most exact and the most sincere, would they dare assure an accuracy of 60 ts in a degree, since 60 ts does not suppose an error of 4 seconds in measuring the celestial arc, and none in geographical determina tions?_Nothing therefore requires us to believe the meridians dis 107 similar." Cassini III reached a different conclusion from the same premises: geodetic and astronomic measurements being uncertain, only Cassini's method of light signals gave mankind a chance to 108 answer satisfactorily God's question to Job. Meanwhile, Boscovich snatched the initiative from the French academicians. He called attention to Bouguer's finding that a big mountain in Peru drew aside a plumb bob by a few seconds of arc, thus falsifying the vertical and the orientation of instruments in its neighborhood.

To obtain measures without mountains, Boscovich proposed to the Royal Society of London and the Austro-Hungarian Empress that they commission determinations of a degree across the plains in America and in Eastern Europe; and to the King of the Two Sicilies that, for com parison, he do the same, in the foothills of the Alps around Turin.109 The Royal Society commissioned Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, already surveying in the New World, to measure an arc in Maryland; the Holy Roman Empress sent off Liesganig to the prairies of Hungary, where he measured out baselines using rafters from the Jesuit college in Vienna; and the King of the Sicilies asked the professor of physics in the University of Turin, Giambattista Beccaria, to try his hand at a degree in Piedmont. Boscovich had lit tle confidence in the "cherished children" of the Academy, that is, the degrees taken in Lapland and Peru; he preferred to base geo desy on the comparison of different meridians measured at roughly the same middle latitudes, as in Maryland, France, Northern Italy, and Austria. He thought for a time to carry on the work himself, in California. The refusal of a travel permit by the Spanish authorities saved him from that barbarous place.110 The three projects stimulated by Boscovich only increased confu sion. Mason and Dixon did not triangulate, but measured their degree directly on the ground; they had the advantage of a level terrain, and the best English instruments; they corrected for tem perature and compared their measuring rods carefully with the "toise de Perou;" "yet"?it is the opinion of the late 18th century? "the result was no better than the rest." The critic, von Zach, could not grant even that much to Beccaria or Liesganig. Beccaria had bobbled his arc by 900 ts ("an altogether intolerable error") and missed an angle by 13 minutes, according to measurements Zach took on the spot with a repeating circle made by Reichenbach; whereas Liesganig, according to his manuscripts, which Zach had 109.

He had served as Liesganig's administrative assis tant, but did no surveying. He wrote a friend thirty years later: "You will scarcely believe it, never once did I see a triangle, an angle, an azimuth, a reduction to the meridian or perpendicular, all that was reserved to the P.P.S.J. IHS," the fathers of the Society of Jesus. "I had no experience of this survey, the Jesuits kept it all secret from me_Liesganig was fundamentally a complete ignoramus." Elsewhere Zach complained of the unreasonable secrecy of the Austrian military authorities about geographical and statistical matters.112 The secretiveness of the French and Piedmon tese authorities about maps and mapping during peacetime has already been mentioned. Even the sea-girt British worried that their collaboration with the French in linking the observatories of Paris 113 and Greenwich might compromise security. It is only fair to leave the last word to Liesganig, whose measure ments were to some extent vindicated by Ludwig August von Fal lon, who travelled the same route in 1806. Perhaps with his unwil lingly sedentary assistant in mind, Liesganig spoke for all field workers impugned by armchair Zachs. "Whoever dreads steep and rugged paths and mountain crossings on foot, whoever shies away from storms, heat, and cold, and other continuous bodily discom forts," had no warrant to criticize; "to him," says Liesganig, "I wish a quiet life and a soft pillow."114 Liesganig, Beccaria, and Mason and Dixon's spokesman, Astrono mer Royal Maskelyne, assigned all discrepancies in values for the earth's flattening to the unknown effects of mountains.115 In order 111.

Charles Mason, then back in England, was engaged to look for a suitable hill. He found one in Scotland, a nice symmetrical isolated height named Mt Schehallien.116 During the summer of 1774, sur veyors triangulated the neighborhood while Maskelyne measured the zenith distance of a certain star from temporary observatories just north and south of the base of the hill. Let the observed zenith distances be P and Q, the angle through which the hill pulls the plumb line off the vertical be &lt;5, and the two zenith distances be a and ? (figure 4.2.4). Then, since a = P+d and Q = ? + &lt;5, 2d = Q -P-(? - a), that is, the deviation b is half the difference between the observed and the true differences in latitude. Maskelyne obtained Q - P = 54.6 seconds by play with his zenith sector; his surveyors found the arc NS, which, when reduced to an angle using the latest value for the radius of an approximately spherical earth, gave ? - a = 42."94, whence 5 = 5."8.117 The exercise made plausible the irksome perturbation attributed to mountains by geodecists; it did not show, however, that taking mountainous attraction into account would bring all the determinations of the earth's flattening into accord.

He decided he would be safer in Spain, and so began his mapping there, with great efficiency until an injury com pelled him to break off early in 1793. By the time he had recovered and completed the arc in Spain, with an immaculate determination of the latitude of the southern terminus at Montjouy, the Spanish</page><page sequence="241">VARIETIES OF MERCANTILIST MATHEMATICS / 233 government had closed the border to Frenchmen. Mechain passed his enforced leisure by observing stars in Barcelona, also with exquisite accuracy; but, to complete his misfortunes, the difference in latitude between Mountjouy and Barcelona, as deduced from the stars, came out 3.24 seconds larger than the difference Mechain had calculated from the 950 ts between the stations that he had 118 obtained by earthly triangulations. These miserable three seconds tormented Mechain for the rest of his life. While Mechain stagnated in Barcelona, Delambre had one unpleasant adventure after another in the north of France. Anti clerical peasants had knocked down many of the church towers that had served his predecessors; when he hung lanterns as substitute sights, he was suspected of signalling to the enemy (France had been at war with most of Europe since April 1792). Armed citizens prevented him from carrying out his orders. His heroism may be gauged from his experience at Epinay, where, having been detained by local patriots, he tried to explain his mission in an impromptu lecture on geodesy. To no avail. He was packed off to a higher jur isdiction, in Saint Denis. The square teemed with volunteers waiting to go to the front, who did not have the prerequisites for the crash course in triangulation they forced him to give. "They did not receive me more favorably [than in Epinay]. Evening came on; you could not see. The audience was very large: the front rows heard without understanding; those behind heard less and saw nothing. They grew impatient and grumbled; some proposed one of those quick means [of dealing with suspect people] then so much in vogue." Were it not for a quick-witted official, who rushed Delam bre into protective custody, the arc might have ended in Saint Denis. The National Assembly found time while busy transforming France into a Republic, which it declared on September 22, 1792, to issue an order for Delambre's release. He returned to Paris to observe from the top of the Pantheon. That occupied him during January and February of 1793. It then took him two months to acquire a passport to return to the field. Although he had many explanations to make en route, especially as he approached the 118.

By the fall he was work ing around Dunkirk, repeating Lacaille's triangles whenever possi ble.119 While Delambre put his triangles together, the Revolution took apart the institutions on which his work depended. On August 8, 1793, it closed the Academy of Sciences, and, just before Christmas, it fired Delambre. He was then working in the Loire, where he had erected a tower 64 feet tall, which had the usual effect on rural sen sibilities. News of his dismissal reached him in bitter cold weather, on the shaking tower, as he strove to serve the people. On his return to Paris, he was interrogated by a revolutionary committee. It studied his manuscripts without making much of them and pounced on a diploma from the Royal Society, which bore the arms of George III. Delambre found it prudent to retire from the service 120 of his country. Shortly thereafter a powerful advocate of geodesy came to the rescue: that General Calon who had helped to improve the survey ing technique of the Royal Geographical Engineers. Calon had become a deputy and a Jacobin; his previous service to the king inhibited him not at all from voting for the execution of Louis XVI, "without reprieve." His rampant republicanism may perhaps be associated with unfulfilled ambition and a sense of injury suffered in the late 1770s, when, as a veteran of 20 years, he had been ordered to do survey work of a kind usually assigned to his 121 juniors. The suppression of his former corps presented Calon with a vacuum in which to fullfil his ambition. With the corps went the map department of the Depot de la guerre, the headquarters and storehouse of military cartography. It was replaced by an Agence temporaire des cartes with jurisdiction over all maps belonging to the state, including those held by the Commission du mouvement et de l'organisation des troupes, directed by Calon. Very soon all was confusion: the agency could not handle the flood of maps, and Calon, who became head of the Depot in April 1793, managed to 119.

He then purged the place of suspect employees; repopulated it with the graduates of a school he esta blished in astronomy, geography, engineering, history, languages, and engraving; and staffed his school and his service (which was under pressure to provide maps of the front and of captured terri tories to the Army) with all the unoccupied savants he could locate. At its height in the fall of 1796, Calon's empire included the former archives of marine cartography, a printing office, and the school, at an annual cost of 300,000 livres. His expansiveness caused inefficiencies and inspired jealousies, and by the spring of 1797 he 122 and his empire had fallen. Among those Calon enticed back was Mechain, who had begun his career as a naval hydrographer. (Mechain had managed to get himself to Genoa in September 1794, after a narrow escape from corsairs.) Delambre also came to Calon. It was agreed, probably early in 1795, that they would triangulate the new departments and that, to prepare as firm a base as possible for the work, they would resume the measurement of the meridian. Then at the zenith of his influence, Calon persuaded the Committee on Public Safety to grant 220,000 livres for map-making, half of it to go to extending Cassini's Carte de France into the Rhineland and half to go toward 123 finishing the meridian between the Loire and the Pyrenees. That occurred on May 13, 1795. Delambre left Paris on June 28 in the capacity of "astronomer of the Depot de la guerre" to resume his observations at Orleans. He had trouble finding intact steeples and the cost of erecting signals quickly depleted his cash. No one wished to accept the assignats (government IOUs) he carried; once again Calon tided him over. Also, three years of republican rule had not made peasants less suspicious and superstitious: they now tore down his signals on the theory that they attracted storms. Mechain had his hardships, too, as he crawled north across the mountains toward his rendezvous in Rodez. In one place, an outcrop 600 ts high and 2 ts wide surrounded by precipices, he sat for days waiting for the clouds to lift long enough to work the Borda circle. He arrived within signalling distance of Rodez around 122. Ibid., 1, 126-127, 130-132, 135-150. 123.

Mechain would not accept Delambre's help and could not go on. "In this cruel situation," he wrote his collaborator, "I prefer to stay in this terrible exile, far from what I cherish in the world; I will sacrifice everything, give up everything, rather than return without finishing my part of the job." Delambre felt that he could not insist, and Mechain finished the arc the following September.124 After concluding his triangles at Rodez, Delambre joined Laplace at Melun to fix the ends of the baseline near Paris. Unfortunately, all the Borda rules needed were not ready until the following spring (1798). Their use proved extremely tedious. Following Boscovich's initiative, Borda's rulers did not touch; a platinum tongue advanced by a micrometer screw extended to cover gaps; and the tongue was calibrated to show not only distance but also temperature, by its expansion relative to the copper body of the ruler. Working this exact and exacting instrument, Delambre could make only about 90 lengths of the rule (about 180 ts) a day; it took 33 days to cover the entire distance of 6,075.90 ts. In the summer he redid the Perpignan baseline. That took six weeks. The length of the Perpignan base as calculated from the length of the Melun base and the triangles differed from the measurement on the ground by less than a foot. On October 22, 1798, everything required to calculate the length of the arc from Dunkirk to Barcelona was in hand. Mechain and Delambre returned to Paris, where an international committee had assembled to examine, approve, advertise, and propagate their results.125 Meanwhile, Delambre had uncovered an oddity: if the 45th degree of latitude bisects the measured arc, the value of the entire quadrant to which the arc belongs may be calculated to a very close 126 approximation without knowing the ellipticity of the earth. The truth of this unexpected proposition may be discerned as follows. The element of length along the ellipse (see figure 4.2.3) is 124.

Since, as will appear, the meter introduced by revolutionary France was defined as a fraction of the quadrant, French geodecists could push their government to support extending the arc through Paris south of Barcelona to a station in the Balearics as far below the 45th parallel as Dunkirk is above it. In September 1802, Mechain approached Napoleon for support "for thus completing so 127 beautiful a project, the greatest ever undertaken." He died in Spain before he could realize the mission. Four years later Biot and Arago, backed financially and intellectually by Laplace and the Bureau des longitudes, undertook to extend Mechain's terminus to the island of Formentera. The expedition had its tedium and excite ment. On the tedious side, Biot and Arago had to sit for three 127. Quoted ibid., 450.</page><page sequence="246">238 / VARIETIES OF MERCANTILIST MATHEMATICS months in the mountains of Majorca before they could detect by telescope, across the open sea, the flares that would link them to Mechain's grid. They could see with no trouble the town of Castil lon de la Plana on the mainland, where Mechain had died, but the pinpoint of light, no brighter to them than a star of the fifth magni tude, eluded them. At last, on a clear night with clear eyes, success; "I would not know how to express the emotion we felt," Biot wrote in 1810, in his report of the trip. The natives who visited the obser vation hut also left him speechless. "When they entered the silent room.. .the contrast of civilization with barbarism, of the most sub lime knowledge with the deepest ignorance, had something great and pitiful about it that touched the soul in a way I would not know how to express." As for excitement, Biot ran into some Ragu san pirates on his way home. He gave them what gold he had and a lecture on geodesy. They let him and his companions go. "I must 128 say that they treated us very well, for pirates." The upshot of the measurement was that the meter as calculated over the whole arc from Dunkirk to Formentera differed by under 0.2 mm from the meter as calculated over the lesser arc from Dunkirk to Barcelona. Still unsatisfied, the Bureau des longitudes asked Biot to try his instruments in Britain, on an extension of the arc through Greenwich into the Shetland Islands. He arrived in 1817, on the invitation of the Ordnance Survey, which hoped to use the occasion to finish the match between the repeater and the theodolite. Unfortunately Biot, though appreciated by Mudge ("a very able man and a very diligent observer") fell out with Mudge's lieutenants, who held him responsible for French criticism of certain results of the survey, to be mentioned presently, and Biot took his 129 angles on his own. To the great glory of the British nation, how ever, the Shetlanders, unlike the Majorcans, understood his mission, and helped. They may have known more about the business than he did, for he located his headquarters on the Island of Unst on the meridian of Formentera, from which it differs by well over two 128.

The error made for good rhetoric in the cause of a Europe united intellectually under French dominance. "The great arc [Biot wrote], starting from the Balearic Islands, crosses Spain, France, England, and Scotland to arrive at the rocks of Ancient Th?le. When combined with the flattening of the earth deduced from pen dulum measurements or the theory of the moon, will it not give for the fundamental unit, or the meter, the most complete and, if I dare 130 say it, the most European determination that can be desired?" No ellipsoid of revolution The data obtained by Mechain and Delambre further perplexed the would-be discoverer of the true shape of the earth. Were the earth an ellipsoid of revolution, the analyst could establish its flattening from two measured arcs and their mean latitudes, as fol lows. Let a and b be the unknown semi-axes. Then (figure 4.2.3 and equation 4.2.1^he radius of curvature r at a point P at the latitude X is r = (a1 lb) 1+ f&lt;f\ (4-1) fc2+a2ctn2X V (4.2.5) (Other spheroids than ellipses would of course yield different func tional relationships between r and X.) Each measurement delivered a value of r (via the length of a meridional degree, 27rr/360) and its associated X; every pair of measurements defined an ellipse a, b, and a flattening e = (a - b)/a. In 1783, when he first reviewed the measurements, Laplace deduced that e = 1/250, a value apparently confirmed by scattered determinations of the beats of pendulums, which gave Newton's number, 1/230. Six years later, making a new choice among the measured arcs, Laplace obtained = 1/279, which did not agree with the best from new pendulum counts, which gave 1/359. Adding the result of Mechain and Delambre and ignoring that of Maupertuis (a disrespect later justified by the remeasurement by Svandberg), Laplace obtained the smaller flattening of 1/307.8, which agreed with a calculation by Legendre if not with the shape of the earth. Delambre almost reproduced Laplace's over-precise 130.

The French had a strong political interest in establishing that all meridians have very nearly 131 the same shape in order to save the rhetoric of the metric system. British analysts, unencumbered with the meter, doubted that any ellipsoid would do. After comparing eight sets of measurements, Roy declared unequivocally that the earth could not be a rotated ellipse. His successors, the first Ordnance surveyors, Williams, Mudge, and Dalby, concurred: "the measured degrees of latitude in different places are inconsistent with an elliptical meridian." Their redetermination of the distance between the Paris and Greenwich observatories could be accommodated on Newton's ellipsoid, e = l/230; but that would disagree with the results of the expedi tions to Lapland and Peru by an unacceptable 137 ts. Their determi nations of the radius of curvature at several latitudes in England required a flattening of e = 1/149, as large as the suspect value of 132 Maupertuis. Pushing his inquiries further, Mudge ran a meridian from near Bristol to the Isle of Wight. His equipment and technique were of the best: the Ramsden theodolite, a new Ramsden zenith sector, a base line laid out to two inches in over 26000 feet in accordance with Roy's procedures at Hounslow Heath. The result: at 52?2'20", a degree spans 60820 fathoms; at 51?35'18", 60864 fathoms; which is to say, that degrees grow longer towards the equator, exactly the opposite of their expected behavior on a Newtonian earth. How to explain such an embarrassment? Mudge could not cast the blame upon the mountains, for he had encountered only a few hills, so he called upon the oceans. "Meridianal operations carried on in insular countries are not so likely to afford just conclusions with regard to the different length of the degrees, as the same operations con 133 ducted in places very remote from deep seas." 131.

A Spanish mathemati cian, Joseph Rodriguez, who had accompanied Biot and Arago to Formentera, reasoned that because Ramsden's theodolite gave trian gles that usually closed to under one second, Mudge must have blundered with the zenith sector to have ended with degrees that increased toward the equator. Working backwards from the French flattenings of 1/310 and 1/320, Rodriguez made out that Mudge had missed his zenith distances by the unaccountably large margin of four arc-seconds. That called forth a vigorous defense by Mudge's colleague Olinthus Gregory. What could be the motive of the "foreigner" Rodriguez? "[The] object appears to be no other than the depression of English (and perhaps other) ingenuity and exer tion to the undue exaltation of the French character." Gregory's substantive defense was that Rodriguez had assumed arbitrarily that the earth has the shape of an ellipsoid; in fact, values of the flatten ing ran from 1/148 to 1/540; even Laplace had admitted, though circumspectly, that no single ellipsoid would fit the data. Seas, mountains, valleys, hills, special strata, all could draw a pendulum off the vertical by the four seconds that wrankled Rodriguez. More over, Mudge had been unfortunate in two of the stars on which he sighted; Herschel had shown them to be doubles, and not depend able points.134 But Rodriguez made little impression on geodecists, who welcomed Mudge's bizarre finding as conclusive proof of the literally over-riding influence of local irregularities. Most knowledg eable people, including Delambre, accepted Mudge's work as reli able and the ellipsoid as illusory.135 During the second decade of the 19th century calculations con verged on an average value for e around what Laplace and Delam bre made it. Von M?ffling arrived at 1/315.6 from his mop-up of Tranchot's work between 1814 and 1817; Eckhardt, completing the survey he began in cooperation with Schleiermacher at Darmstadt in 1807, derived 1/309.97 with the help of the technique of least squares; the inventor of the technique moved from 1:187 to 1:334, to settle on 1:302.78 around 1820; and Laplace, exploiting the 134.

Other least squarers, Struve, Bessel, and Muncke, deduced 1/297.648, 1/300.705, and 1/307.7, respectively, the last, by Muncke, from 18 combinations of 7 sets of measurements. William Lambton, who logged the longest arc measured up to 1820, with almost 10? through India, settled on 1/310 after combining his results with arcs in France, England, and Sweden. Various assort ments of measurements made around Geneva, Milan, and Padua made for a slightly flatter earth, at between 1/271.31 and 1/292.136 The consensus value, e-1/300, was recognized as an average. The earth appeared not to have a regular shape. Franz Xaver von Zach's brother Anton, who conducted a trigonometrical survey for the Austrians around Venice, declared in 1806 that the most that could be claimed for certain about the earth's profile was that the equatorial diameter exceeded the polar. It was he who recom mended that the earth's shape be defined, not found, via the method of least squares. This definition, which agreed with one given by Clairaut, was adopted and pushed by Gauss. "On a small scale the earth is certainly no ellipsoid, but deviates in a wave-like way from the ellipsoid that represents the earth at large_What we call the earth's surface in the geometrical sense is nothing other than a surface that everywhere cuts the direction of gravity at right angles and coincides with the surface of the sea." This wavy figure, the "geoid," has as its closest approximation an ellipsoid with a flattening of 1/298.3. That agrees almost exactly with James Ivory's weighted average of 1/300, and closely with the consensus figure of 1/310 concocted from the various heroic measures made with the techniques, and by the savants, of the ancien regime.137 The story has the useful moral that not everything in the physical world, not even all well-defined mathematical abstractions of it, may be measurable. 136.

PLIGHT OF THE PEOPLE Cain's legacy God may have made the world according to weight and measure, but it was Cain who invented weights and measures, and thus?we have this from Flavius Josephus?"converted the innocent simplicity in which man had lived into a miserable existence dominated by fraud and deceit."1 The existence of French men and women around 1790 was made miserable by, among other things, 700 or 800 differently named measures and untold units of the same name but different sizes. A "pinte" in Paris came to 0.93 liter; in Saint Denis, to 1.46; in Seine-en-Montagne, to 1.99; in Precy-sous-Thil, to 3.33. The aune, a unit of length, was still more prolific: Paris had three, each for a different sort of cloth; Rouen had two; and France as a whole no fewer than seventeen, all in common use and all different, the smallest amounting to just under 300 lignes, royal measure, the largest to almost 600. France possessed nonuniform measures in law as well as by cus tom. Their multiplicity went with other relics of the feudal system, which maintained arbitrary rents and duties usually to the disad vantage of the peasant. A landlord wanted his bushels of grain or 1.

Nor were all seigneurs above enlarging the vessel in which they collected their rents; and since in many cases they possessed the only exem plars of their patrimonial bushel, no one could be certain that it did not grow in time. But one suspected. A frequent complaint in the cahiers, or notebooks of desiderata brought by representatives of the people to the meeting of the Estates General in 1789, was that "the nobles' measure waxes larger year by year." These same representa tives castigated the oppressive confusion of customary measures as barbaric, ridiculous, obscurantist, gothic, and revolting, and demanded an end to them, and the establishment of a system of unchanging and verifiable weights and measures throughout the country, or at least throughout their region. Many urged that the King's measure, the royal foot, be made the law of the land.3 Sharpers and crooks whose practices were not sanctioned by ancient rights and wrongs and middlemen acting in analogy to money changers opposed the rationalization that menaced their livelihood. In 1747, shortly after returning to Paris with the vision acquired while measuring a piece of a meridian in Peru, La Con damine identified and condemned this special interest, which he proposed to abolish with the confusions that engendered it. His accusation echoed in France for decades and eventually bounced across the Channel. We read in the cahiers from Orleans that multi tudinous measures "expose[d] people daily to swindlers" and in the records of Parliament that John Riggs Miller, one of its obscure and verbose Members, declared that they had but one purpose, "the perplexing of all dealings, and the benefitting knaves and cheats."4 Reformers laid down several requirements for a new system of weights and measures. It should not rest on an arbitrary unit, espe cially not on a king's foot; it must not offer enticements to cheaters; and it had to be easily reproduceable were its exemplars lost. Further, it had to be rational, so as to recommend itself to all nations, and become universal. The "toise de Perou" had attained 3.

It would not do to impose them, however, as Talleyrand wrote Miller, since they had not been derived from nature or constructed "with the ceremony necessary to settle once and for all the opinion of all enlightened nations." Last and also first, the reformed system had to be simple, or, as Miller preferred to say, "on a level with the lowest and hum blest capacity." It must not require "skill in calculation beyond what.. .the inferior orders of men commonly possess;" everyone should be able to confirm for himself the correctness of all transac tions of interest to him, "the meanest intellect.. .on a par with the most dexterous."5 This last paragraph contains many buzz-words of the Enlighten ment.6 The replacement of the arbitrary and the capricious, of the feudal and historical, by the natural is the message of all the philo sophies from Montesquieu to Condorcet. The natural coincides with the rational and the universal: when people cast aside customary belief and established abuse, they can reach agreements that all oth ers, guided by their own reason, will accept. This reason is not the property of a few great intellects; everyone has the right to know, and to recognize, the truth. Any system that claims universal assent must be universally intelligible. Mathematics and the rights of man From the most remote times philosophers have taken number as the exemplar of the intelligible. Once one has grasped a principle in geometry, it was said, not even God Himself could understand it better, although, to be sure, He might know more theorems. Calcu lating people think for themselves; they despise the unintelligible, capricious, unfounded, authoritarian, and feudal as infringements on their thoughts and actions. In brief, mathematics is a science for free people. Or, to say the truth as the 18th century saw it, for free men. Newton's doctor, Sir John Arbuthnot, praised mathematics for giving "a manly vigour to the mind;" a tonic Newton took to such good effect that he mastered all "the noble and manly sciences" and became "the greatest man that ever liv'd."7 All this will help to 5.

The metric measurers, they said, reaching for their highest compliment, had carried through their work "with the confidence of a male and republican spirit."8 Perhaps the most significant sign of burgeoning rudimentary numeracy during the 18th century was the multiplication of tables of numerical equivalence. A good survey of the tables in use in commerce has yet to be made; but there is no doubt that their number increased dramatically after the Seven Years' War. They came in several sorts: conversions of weights, measures, and moneys; total price of goods, tabulated by size and unit cost; tables of interest and annuities; agricultural yields; and so on. It did not require great prowess at mathematics to use these compilations; rather, a degree of numeracy comparable to the literacy of one who could read but not write. The spread of the metric system depended on this widespread rudimentary numeracy, and raised its level. Commercial tables were required not only because of the number and uncertain equivalence of feudal weights and measures, but also, and perhaps primarily, because the arbitrary multiples and submul tiples of the various units made computation burdensome and com plex. Calculation of the price of a piece of cloth 2 yards 1 foot 4 inches square at 3 pence 2 farthings the square foot was a sufficient challenge. To change it into aunes, pieds, livres, and deniers, and to proceed to a problem in bushels and cubic king's feet, would have puzzled Archimedes. According to the Paris Academy, referring to the situation in 1790, people at ease with money computations could not handle weights and measures. "In the present state of affairs, a man who can calculate with sous and deniers cannot cal culate with toises, pieds, pouces, and lignes, with livres, onces, gros and grains."9 The Paris Academy and many other scientific reformers supposed that by dividing the new standards and the revised coinage decimally they would eliminate the need for specialist computers. 8.

This natural arithmetic, "previously locked up in the domain of the sciences," was precisely what the reformers thought they sought. "Those who knew little will know everything; others will hurry to forget what they no longer need to know; all will accept as a true benefit a method of calculation that will save them time, study, and chances for error."11 Prieur de la Cote d'Or, the collaborator of Guyton de Morveau who had graduated to the all-powerful Committee of Public Safety (Comite du salut public), expected the decimal calculus to be the technical language of Utopia. "How happy we will be not to be forced to consult anyone about our prosperity, property, expenses, and drink, and to have nothing to do any more with people who often seek only to profit from our ignorance."12 The connection between democracy and the decimal was made plain and explicit by Condorcet during the first year of the Revolution. Decimalization, he said, fit perfectly with the political program and mandate of the National Assembly. "It [the Assembly] wants to insure that in the future all citizens can be self-sufficient in all calculations related to their interests; without which they can be neither really equal in rights.. .nor really free."13 Long after the promulgation of the metric system, Laplace advised Napoleon that its chief advantage as understood by its creators was not the destruction of feudal metrol ogy but the division by tens.14 In order that the people be reminded of the benefit every time they used it, the new measures carried prefaces that designated 10.

Ini tially the Academy reckoned that the beneficiaries would not be able to grasp the system, and so recommended common names, like "doigt" and "palme," rather than "deci-," "centi-," and "milli-," for submultiples of the meter. They erred in calculating revolution ary zeal. The Committee on Public Instruction (Comite destruction publique) preferred a clean sweep and adopted the systematic names. This occurred on August 1, 1793, on the eve of the suppres sion of the Academy.15 One of the Academy's successors in metric matters explained that "it is almost impossible to reason correctly without a language aptly made."16 The language did not please the people. Classicists objected that the prefixes (enriched by "deca-," "hecta-," and "kilo-") violated the grammar of ancient languages, while the uneducated could make no sense of them at all. "These names," declared a delegate to the Convention, "novel and unintelligible to the large majority of our citizens, are not necessary for the maintenance of the Repub lic."17 He did not know what he had escaped. Prieur de la Cote d'Or, who had taken an active part in the reform of weights and measures from the onset of the Revolution, had names of his own, derived, he said, from ancient languages and Low Breton. The irra tionality of the Convention did not extend to adopting "kilicymbe," "myriadore," "ladedix," "pezeprime," "centicadil," or "decidol," and Prieur, bending to the political wind in 1795, drew up what became the definitive metric names. The many centicadils of bitter ness he then swallowed and decidols of crow he then ate were to 18 damage the work of the metric reformers. All concerned might have spared themselves the trouble.

The Paris academicians demonstrated solidarity with the regime by dividing a right angle into 100 revolutionary degrees, and each such degree into 100 minutes; and they found much pleasant recreation in recomputing the trigonometrical func tions in what Delambre later extolled as "the vastest [calculation] 19 that had ever been done, or even conceived." The cost of conver sion to decimal units had the merit of expressing angles in the arith metic system in which computations on them were performed. Academicians and surveyors appreciated the scheme, which still exists in France along with the sexigesimal, or Babylonian division of the circle. A less enduring but farther reaching reform tried to rescue the calendar and timekeeping from the Babylonians and the Church. Even before the Revolution, anti-clerical almanack makers attributed days not to saints but to people they considered as benefactors of mankind. One such production, the Almanac des honnetes hommes of 1787, which jumbled together Moses and Voltaire, Descartes and Aristotle, Newton and Cassini, Christ and Campanella, earned the attention of the public executioner. "This monstrous assembly," said the King's attorney, "advertises a project formed some time ago to destroy the Christian religion by ridicule_I blush to give an account to this court of the absurd and revolting consequences of 20 this work of impiety, atheism, and madness." This reasoned discourse will give a measure of the seriousness of tampering with the calendar. In the autumn of 1793 the Committee of Public instruction undertook to tamper. It was emboldened by several considerations. For one, almanack makers, newspaper editors, and politicians had for some time dated their statements from the beginning of the revolutionary era or, more recently, from the declaration of the Republic on September 22, 1792. Some worked from January 1, 19. Exposition (an x), 13-14; Delambre, Rapport historique (1810), 8. 20.

Again, the heating up of revolu tionary rhetoric condemned the old calendar not only for its saints' days, but also for its preservation of ancient superstition in the form of the seven-day week. And then there were arguments drawn from the fountain from which the metric reformers had drunk: the old calendar with its months with crazy lengths, its 24-hour days, and its bizarre rules for intercalation, were an affront to both reason and nature. On September 20, 1793 the Committee heard proposals for reform drawn up by Gilbert Romme with the assistance of academi cians Alexandre-Guy Pingre (an old astronomer), Guyton de Mor 21 veau (chemist), and Lagrange and Monge (mathematicians). The report opens with a reference to the metric reform, "one of the most important operations for the progress of the arts and the human spirit." The Committee must do no less for the calendar. "Arts and history, for which time is a necessary element or instru ment, also ask you for new measures of duration, which are equally free from the errors that credulity and superstitious custom have transmitted to us through centuries of ignorance." By great good fortune, "perhaps unique in the world's annals," the declaration of the republic and the end of monarchy had occurred on the very day of the autumnal equinox of 1792. "Thus the equality of days and nights was marked in the heavens at the very moment when the representatives of the French people proclaimed civil and moral equality as the sacred foundation of its new government_Thus the sun passed from one hemisphere to the other on the same day that the people, triumphing over the oppression of kings, passed from a monarchical to a republican regime." Nature and politics identified the day of the true equinox as the first day of the revolu tionary year and, retrospectively, the equinox of 1792 as the begin ning of the republican era.22 It remained to apply the decimal. "You have felt all the advan tages of decimal numeration. You have adopted it for all weights and measures, and for the Republic's money; we propose to you to 21.

Each will have 30 days divided into three parts or decades of ten days each. Thus, in one blow, the irrational unequal ancient months will perish, and also the astrological seven-day week. And that is not all, or enough. "Perfection will be complete when time is submitted to the simple and general rule of dividing everything by tens." The day should be divided decimally. For the rest, the year should be given its true complement of days by adding five to the twelve months in ordi nary years and six when required to keep the new year on the first 23 day of the first month. All this became law on October 5, 1793, which required that public acts and documents thenceforth be dated in the new style. Decimilization of time would begin on the first day of the third year of the Republic.24 As this last formulation indicates, the new calendar gave rise to awkward expressions for dates. It would be convenient to have names for the months and perhaps also for the days, if a rational nomenclature could be devised and, what is much more, deployed. The problem prompted an instructive argument in the Committee of Public Instruction. Some members, inspired by the revolutionary almanack makers, proposed to name the months after revolutionary heroes or virtues. Their opponents objected that the choice would be arbitrary and, necessarily, peculiar to the recent experience of the French. That would not recommend the scheme to the rest of Europe. But if the months and days were numbered rather than named? "Your calendar, which would have been that of the French nation, will become the calendar of all people. They will never abandon the numerical order, which is the natural one_Your phi losophical calendar can become the basis of the universal repub 25 lie." The Committee at first voted for moral names then reversed itself and stayed numerical. It also asked a sub-committee to con 26 sider the matter further.

The days of the decade would answer to //Primidi,,, "Duodi," etc., up to "Decadi;" and each day of the year would be associated with a different agricultural implement or pro duct, vegetable, fruit, or tree. Thus the calendar would become a vehicle of natural history, a reminder "not of the nation's cult, but of its culture" (figure 5.1.1), an occasion for disquisitions on mineralogy, physics and husbandry.27 The scheme became law on 4 Frimaire an ii (24 November 1793), together with a specification of the revolutionary day: ten days composed of 100 decimal minutes each composed of 100 decimal seconds. The names of the months became current, but not the day names, associations, or decimal 28 divisions. Toward the end of Frimaire, the Committee on Public Instruction published a Calendrier de la Republique Francaise. It combined rhe toric taken from Romme's report of the preceding September with several technical tables: conversion of Gregorian dates to Fabre's calendar for an ii; concordance of revolutionary and Babylonian time; a table of occurrence of the true autumnal equinox, from 1792 to 1804, in sexigesimal and in decimal hours; and a comparison of intercalations on the Gregorian and revolutionary styles. As an indi cator of the advantages of the new scheme, the Calendrier gave the epact (the moon's age) on 1 Vendemiaire an ii and calculated the age on 23 Prairial an ii. Since Prairial is the ninth month, and since earch month is about a half day longer than a mean lunation, the moon is 17 + 23 + 8/2 = 44 days old on the day assigned, or rather 44 - 29.5 = 14.5 days old, "to sufficient [accuracy] for domestic pur poses." There was also guidance for the perplexed horologist. A sin gle clock face divided into 100 parts could mark the hour by the hundredth of a circuit, the day by a tenth, and the decade by the 27.

Conversion between old and new styles required only a single hand moving across a clock face marked in sexigesimal and decimal time in concentric cir cles (figure 5.1.2).29 A few clocks beating decimal seconds were made, primarily for the use of academicians. Lavoisier had one. Lenoir made some for Mechain and Delambre, and another instrument maker, Ferdinand Berthoud, produced one for help in determining the length of a seconds pendulum. The Commission temporaire observed that the length of a decimal-second seconds pendulum must be shorter than that of the usual sort, "which will perhaps be more favorable to observations, and will certainly make astronomical clocks more con venient, since their pendulum will be shorter." The system had the merit of variety. Biot used both decimal and sexigesimal watches in his experiments on the speed of sound down pipes. Apparently bored with the figures obtained from the usual timekeeper, he employed both sorts, "to vary the numbers observed."30 Alas! The new ways of telling time did not recommend them selves to those it was designed to serve. The people declined to liberate themselves from the calendrical thrall of the Church. They might give up Saints' days, might replace the feast of John the Bap tist with one in honor of the modern-day Salome, the good doctor Guillotine; but they would not give up their Sundays. The govern ment fulminated against a Sunday Sabbath, ordered public offices to remain open, insisted upon shutting down public business, mark ets, and theaters, on decadis, and sponsored decadal celebrations of virtue and heroism. The people would have none of it: they had their habits, and they preferred 52 days of rest per year to 36. The Convention and the Directorate found it more difficult to enforce the civil calendar on their citizens than to defeat the armies of Europe. Nor did the academicians and their fellow travelers fully adopt to revolutionary time. In 1793, the Academie offered a prize for a "pocket watch, capable of finding the longitude at sea, whose 29.

In 1798, the Academy reopened the competition, but dropped the require ment of decimilization of time, "to diminish as much as possible difficulties that might keep some competitors away." In 1802, as</page><page sequence="264">256 / THE MEASURE OF ENLIGHTENMENT part of his accommodation with the Vatican, Napoleon dropped sanctions against religious observances on Sundays, and four years later, on 1 January 1806, the people had their way and the state repealed the calendar.31 Revolutionary time had already been suspended, sine die, on 18 germinal an iii (April 7, 1795), as being of greater interest to science than to society. The reasons given by the government for seeking repeal of the revolutionary calendar bear on the character of the metric reform. In systematizing weights and measures, they said, everything paro chial had been discarded; nothing remained to identify the nation that produced it. But the calendar betrayed its origins, especially in the setting of the epoch by the destruction of the monarchy. More over, most knowledgeable savants opposed it because, despite the then recent progress of astronomy and the vast importance of instruments of angular measure, astronomers of the new era could not implement its calendar. As Delambre had argued in 1795, as soon as the political situation allowed him to criticize the work of the Republic, astronomers could not be depended upon to deter mine the sun's position to better than three seconds of arc, which corresponds to more than a minute of time. And, since it would take them several days to complete their calculations in close cases, their fellow citizens would not know for some time when the new year had begun. Also, taking the occurrence of the true equinox as the beginning of the year would introduce irregularities since the length of the year varies by as much as twenty minutes owing to perturbations of the earth's orbit by the constantly shifting planets.32 Neither nature nor mathematics favored the revolutionary calendar. On 15 Fructidor an xiii (3 September 1805), Napoleon's Senate named its most illustrious savant, Laplace, who, as Minister of the Interior, had ordered his underlings to enforce the decadal festivals and the republican calendar, to report on the proposal to terminate the revolutionary era. Cleaving to his role as specialist, he located the chief fault of the new style in its method of intercala tion. To be sure, there was another problem, indeed a serious incon venience, of the revolutionary calendar: it put France out of step 31.

The only downside Laplace could see was the fear that the recall of the calendar would 33 prompt the cancellation of the metric reform. As will appear, the people had no more desire to trade the toise for the meter than to substitute decadis for Sundays. 2. ACTION OF THE ACADEMY An anchor for revolutionary storms In exchange for their salaries, status, and grants for special pro jects like geodetic surveys, the Paris academicians acted as technical advisers to the Crown. Their advice tended to be conservative and elitist, especially in respect of unsolicited proposals from inventors asking for state subventions or monopolies for their novelties. Experience confirmed what arrogance had suspected: most of the proposals were worthless and most of the proposers ignorant. The Academy suggested that artisans might be licensed, but only after passing an examination in geometry and other useful arts. During the Revolution, the Academy faced the hostility directed at all enclaves of privilege and the special anger of frustrated inventors, manufacturers, and would-be scientists who had suffered at its hands.34 Well into 1790 the Academy held its meetings, read papers, and planned projects as usual. Some academicians favored the new regime, but few wished it to go further; almost all lamented the dis turbances that kept them from their work. Many recognized, how ever, that they would have to reorganize their company in keeping with the new style, especially after the establishment in 1791 of a patent law that took from them their chief public service.35 As a partial offset, academicians became increasingly involved in 33.

Of these, the most important, "repeatedly paraded as a prime example of science's potential value to the nation and a concrete instance of the Academy's proper func 36 tion in society," was the reform of weights and measures. A month after the storming of the Bastille, academician Jean Bap tiste Le Roy, physicist, mathematician, and one-time clockmaker, suggested that the Academy propose to the National Assembly a dissolution of the over-rich metrological heritage of the Republic. The proposal, probably drawn up by the Academy's secretary, the marquis de Condorcet, and certainly presented to the Assembly by Talleyrand, set aside all existing units in favor of the length of a pendulum that beat seconds at the 45th parallel of latitude, which passes just north of Bordeaux. Talleyrand proposed further that the British be invited to join in the determination and in promoting the 37 result, "so that all nations might adopt it." On May 8, 1790, the Assembly considered the Talleyrand or Academy proposal together with several others to the same effect, notably one by Prieur, who expressly opposed using an arc of the meridian as a basis. "Besides the magnitude of the fundamental operation required, the difficulty of verifying it, and the impossibil ity of doing so daily, it is not easy to decide how exact the method might be." Here Prieur spoke as a military engineer familiar with surveying practice and with the lingering uncertainies over the ear lier measurements of arcs. The same considerations caused Thomas Jefferson to give up his project of taking a decimal part of Cassini's degree as the basis of a new American unit: "the various trials to measure various portions of [meridians], have been of such various result, as to show there is no dependence on that operation for cer . . ?38 tamty. The seconds pendulum had been proposed as a standard setter for over a century. The pioneer geodecists preferred it: Picard, in 1671, proposed defining the pied as a third, and the toise as twice, the length of the seconds pendulum at a convenient place; Cassini observed that all domestic measures could usefully be referred to 36.

Just before the Revolution, the engineer Gaspar de Prony, who would play an important part in the metrication of France, declared the pendulum to be the ultimate arbiter of length; and after the promulgation of the meter, a compiler of dictionaries, no doubt lifting from his predecessors, held that "the length of the simple pendulum, an invariable quantity always easy to recover, seemed given by nature to serve as a measure in all countries."40 The British had also considered the advantages of Cassini's sugges tion, and of calibrating their yard by the pendulum, in order that "all future generations [may] obtain similar measures of length, capacity, and weight, and thereby render it altogether needless to cut them on stone, or to engrave them on brass, to perpetuate their existence. Miller was about to introduce proposals for the reform of English weights and measures based on the pendulum when a letter from Talleyrand inviting Britain to join France in finding the length of a seconds pendulum came to hand. The plan was simple, and a natural successor to the linking of the observatories of Paris and Greenwich; "all Europe would take [it] as a guarantor of rigorous exactitude."42 While Parliament pondered the opportunity, the Revolution became too hot for Anglo-Saxon reformers, and the Paris Academy removed the rationale for collaboration by deciding not to take the pendulum as primary. Its decision seemed odd to many.43 The rationale must be sought, not in the requirements of measurement, but in the circumstances into which the Revolution propelled the Academy. 39.

The committee reported on October 27 that everything should be decimal.44 It then handed what remained of its charge to a committee consisting of Borda, Lagrange, Laplace, Monge, and Condorcet. On March 19, 1791, these geometers reported that the pendulum was the poorer of the two universal and natural units they could imagine. They plumped instead for a piece of the Paris meridian and yet another measurement of it. Their objections to the pendulum suggest a hidden agenda. In obtaining a length from pendulum beats, they wrote, a unit of time, which has nothing to do with distance, must be invoked; and this unit, the 86,400th part of a day, had the additional blemishes of being both arbitrary and nondecimal. "It is much more natural, in fact, to refer distances from one place to another [the academicians were thinking of a standard for cartography, not for commerce] to a quarter of a terrestrial circle rather than to the length of a pendu lum." The committee did appreciate the greater convenience of the pendulum standard, for which they provided: the Academy would undertake to determine the length of a seconds pendulum at the Paris Observatory, to serve as a secondary reference, the primary to be one ten-millionth of the distance from pole to equator.45 Although the ambition of the academicians did not extend to measuring the full quarter meridian, it opened a task sufficiently large. Borda's committee proposed to redo the arc from Dunkirk to Perpignan and to extend it to Barcelona; to lay out new baselines to observe the pendulum; to determine the weight of an exactly meas ured volume of distilled water at the temperature of melting ice; and to compare all the old units in use in France with the new stan dards. They saw no advantage in British cooperation: "we have excluded from our advice every arbitrary determination, we have used only the common property of all nations_In a word, if the 44.

In the end, how ever, the Academy endorsed the recommendations and sent them to the National Assembly 47 The speciousness of the argument that the choice of Borda's com mittee was the most satisfactory and least arbitrary stands forth from their anticipation of the charge that enlightened people every where might not regard a section of the meridian through Paris and lying almost entirely within France as a unit dictated by nature. They argued: the section should extend equal distances on either side of the 45th parallel because there the seconds pendulum and the size of a degree have their mean values; it is a mere coincidence that the 45th parallel runs through France. But all meridians are bisected at 45 ?. Why take one through Paris? Because only there do meridians have arcs bisected at 45? that terminate at either end at sea level and that are short enough to measure. "There is nothing here that can give the slightest pretext for the reproach that we wished to assert any sort of dominance." Or, as Laplace put the point in a lecture in 1795, "had savants from all countries come together to fix the universal measure, they would not have made a different choice."48 This flim-flam was perfectly clear to Jefferson: "The element of measure adopted by the National Assembly excludes, ipso facto, every nation on earth from a communion of measurement with them; for they acknowledge themselves, that a due portion for admeasurement for a meridian crossing the forty fifth degree of latitude, and terminating at both ends at the same 49 level, can be found in no other country on earth but theirs." 46.

Biot, whose democratic ideology inclined him to openness, gave as the hidden agenda the Academy's wish to settle the shape of the earth once and for all.50 According to Delambre, Borda convinced his committee to opt for the arc because his circle, as suggested by the Paris-Greenwich measurement of 1787, made possible a determination of the meri dian far more accurate than Lacaille's. This consideration left a trace in the committee's report to the Academy in March 1791. Today's instruments, it said, are so good that future improvements would not sensibly change the length of the meter that they determine; "or at least the length of time separating us from an age when everyday transactions would require and could attain such a precision is so great in comparison with the life of a man as to amount to infinity itself."51 To these objectives?the old scientific imperative and the desire to vindicate and promote French instrumentation?should be added the social and strategic concerns of forging bonds with the new state. The metric project had high priority since the abolition of feu dal rights had raised the gathering of rents and taxes in kind to a 52 new level of confusion and litigation. During the several years the project would last, the Academy could expect to enjoy strong government support and a useful flow of cash. On August 8, 1791, some 100,000 livres, more than the Academy's annual state subven tion, was placed at its disposal; estimates of the entire cost of the project ran from 300,000 livres into the millions; and one can scarcely criticize the Academy if it saw in this commitment a pledge 50.

Fall and rise The National Assembly approved the Academy's revised propo sal on March 30, 1791. The Academy immediately divided its work among five commissions: triangulations and latitude determi nations (Cassini, Mechain, Legendre), baselines (Meusnier, Monge), pendulum of Paris (Borda, Coulomb), weight of water (Lavoisier, Ha?y), and comparison of old and new measures (Tillet, Brisson, Vandermonde).54 The whole enterprise was to be directed by Borda, Condorcet, Lagrange, and Lavoisier. Soon death and disinclination reduced this extraordinary mobilization of the brains of France. All geodetic work fell to Delambre and Mechain, Borda and Cassini took on the pendulum, and Lavoisier the water. The first year went by making instruments. Only one Borda circle, that of 1787, existed in 1791; two more, readable to 3 or 4 seconds of arc, were ready in the summer of 1792, when Mechain set out for Spain and Delam bre started north. The instrument answered its advertisements: although difficult to use in a cramped church tower, its precision with enough repetitions was, in Delambre's words, "nearly incredi ble."55 Great accuracy was also achieved in the pendulum experiments, which took place during the summer of 1792 in a pit in the Paris Observatory. The general technique, by no means original with the metric project, was to observe coincidences between a swing of a simple pendulum of length L and that of a clock that accurately beat seconds. Let t\ be the clock time when both pendulums move through the midpoint of their swing together, and let t2 be the time of the next coincidence. In the interval At = t2 - t\, therefore, the number of swings of the two pendulums differs by one and the half period of the simple pendulum is T = At /(At ? 2). (A seconds pen dulum has a period of 1/2, that is, half a swing lasts a second.) Thence the length of the seconds pendulum Ls can be deduced from 53.

If At is large, Ls can be obtained very accurately. Borda designed the apparatus, which was made by Etienne Lenoir, who also supplied the repeating circles. The pendulum bob hung from a 12-foot steel cord suspended from a knife-edge mounted on a subterranean wall in the Paris Observatory. Borda and Cassini observed coincidences through a telescope pointed per pendicularly to the wall (figure 5.2.1). The largest departure from the mean of the twenty coincidences they recorded was one part in 100,000. They corrected their computed Ls for the dependence of the period on the amplitude of the swing, on temperature, on air pressure, on the flexure of the support and the steel cord, on the moment of inertia of the bob, and on much else. The result: Ls = 440.5593 lines of the toise used in the expedition to Peru.56 "Thus/' wrote the Commissioners who presided over the metric project in 1794, "the pendulum can be considered the depository of the unit of measure, or even a method of measuring the earth; and nothing is more suited to instil admiration of physics and geometry than seeing an undertaking that would appear to require travel from one end of the world to the other with great machines reduced to a very simple experiment done in one place with an instrument of modest dimensions."57 That would have made an inexpensive as well as a reasonable standard. Lenoir's bill for the circles, the rules, the water apparatus, and the pendulum was just over 34,000 livres. The Academy then estimated?this is from a progress report of May 2, 1792?that the total project would cost 300,000 livres.58 During the following summer, Mechain and Delambre set off on their adventures. Other academicians started preliminary work on the units of volume and weight. The politicians were also at work, however, and the Academy's elitism grew ever more obnoxious to sensitive patriots. On 8 August 1793, the National Assembly decided to close the Academy along with other unrepublican cor porations.

That first week in August the Assembly had affirmed the decimal system and the meridianal definition of the meter, ordered the continuation of the work, and decreed that the Academy pro vide for the manufacture, distribution, and explanation of provi sional meters for general use while it prosecuted its measurements. This provisional meter was defined as a ten-millionth of ninety times the average degree in France as determined by Lacaille, or 443.444 lines of the Peruvian toise. It differed from the definitive meter by about a quarter of a millimeter. It is not advisable to assign an important job to a specialized government agency one week and to abolish the agency the next. The Assembly therefore immediately accepted the recommendation of the Committee of Public Safety that?because its work would erase the last vestiges of feudal divisions?the Academy's commis sion on weights and measures should be reestablished, with the same personnel, as an independent temporary commission (Com mission temporaire des poids et mesures republicains). It consisted of Borda, Brisson, Cassini, Coulomb, Delambre, Hatiy, Lagrange, Laplace, Lavoisier, Mechain, Monge, and Vandermonde. The Academy's confidence in metrology as an anchor against political storms thus received partial justification. The job of over seeing the making and distribution of the provisional standards brought another large and pressing public responsibility to the academic rump and an important cash flow. The minimum cost of the standards, as estimated by Lenoir and others, would be some 200,000 livres. This minimum provided for copper standards for the geographical departments into which the Revolution had divided the old provinces and for iron standards for the prefectures. The Assembly preferred to avoid this whiff of discrimination and voted an additional 60,000 livres or so to make all the standards of copper except for the platinum exemplars.59 The temporary commission expected the copper standards to be accurate to around one part in 100,000 for the meter and the grave (kilogram) and one part in 10,000 for the pinte (liter).60 59.

Lavoisier was arrested on November 28, 1793; the temporary commission requested his release as necessary to its work; the Committee of Public Safety of the Convention (into which the Assembly had transformed itself on declaring a republic) refused, and, for good measure, purged the temporary commission of Borda, Brisson, Coulomb, Delambre, and Laplace, who had not, in its opinion, shown a proper hatred for kings. The rejection of the appeal for Lavoisier and the order for the purge were drawn up by Prieur, who thus revenged himself on academicians who had opposed his political views and metrological proposals.61 What remained of the temporary commission did little more than print explanations of the new system and revolutionary rhetoric. "Soon [our] vision will no longer be affronted by those old weights and measures that still tell of the odious remains of times and things sullied by tyrants_Every child will know [the system]; and 62 it will help diminish inequality among men." There was no reason to put off enjoyment of the great benefit; the provisional meter would be perfectly satisfactory for commerce; the definitive would make the whole operation "more worthy of the powerful and enlightened nation that has undertaken it." Neither the rhetoric nor the practical business of furnishing provisional metersticks long pro tected the pitiful rump commission. In the spring of 1794, it requested 50,000 livres to pay its artisans; Prieur arranged to give 63 10,000 and to terminate its existence. We are familiar with the intervention of the military, in the per son of General Calon, in reestablishing the metric survey. His provi sion of 110,000 livres for the work of Mechain and Delambre in May of 1795 raised the redoing of the Dunkirk-Perpignan line to the same financial importance as the mapping of captured terri tories, and fit well with proposals Prieur had made the previous March for the prompt completion of the metric project.64 Prieur recommended setting up a temporary agency (Agence temporaire 61.

He estimated that much could be done for 500,000 livres. He had to request another 500,000 livres the following September. Meanwhile the Army lent a hand by collecting old metal, chiefly church bells and discarded measures, to serve materially and symbolically as raw ingredients for metric measures.65 Prieur's program became law on April 7, 1795. It provided for using the "provisional" meter in everyday transactions even after the definitive platinum exemplar came into existence; confirmed the basic names, meter, liter, and gram; and ordered resumption of the measurement of the arc. It established a triumvirate under the Com mittee of Public Instruction to oversee the manufacture, distribution, and explanation of the provisional standards, using machines wher ever possible, "so as to combine facility and swiftness with preci sion, and consequently to allow citizens to buy the new measures at a reasonable price;" and it specifically ordered the new agency to provide graphic representations of conversions requiring no calcula tions by users.66 Later that month the scientific side of operations was entrusted to academic survivors of earlier commissions: Borda and Brisson were to bring in the exemplar of the copper provisional meter within a "decade" (ten days); Mechain and Delambre, to do their thing; Delambre, Laplace, and Prony, to fix a baseline near Paris; Borda, Ha?y, and Prony, to determine the standard of weight; and Berthollet, Monge, and Vandermonde, to oversee the preparation of the platinum to be used in the definitive primary 67 standards. 3.

On April 4, 1796, the Institut took over the metric project through a commission cum posed of the reborn academicians Berthollet, Borda, Brisson, Coulomb, Delambre, Ha?y, Laplace, Legendre, Mechain, Monge, and Prony. They had developed skill in the political as well as the technical aspects of their charge. Laplace proposed the convening of an international body of savants to check and accept the prototypes of the new units. "You realize [Laplace wrote Delambre] that all this is only a formality, to enable them to consider the system as their own, to do away with national envy, and to make them adopt the measures." Borda opposed the meeting; Napoleon supported it; the Directory ordered it.68 The irrepressible Talleyrand, now minister of foreign affairs, issued the invitations and had the satisfaction this time of omitting Britain altogether. The international committee of experts convened appropriately in a military setting, in the Depot de la marine, on November 28, 1798, having waited in Paris for a few months for Delambre and Mechain to remeasure a baseline. These patient experts represented client states and friendly powers, to wit: the Bavarian, Cisalpine, Helvetian, Ligurian, and Roman Republics, and Denmark, Sardinia, Spain, and Tuscany. The meeting divided into three working com mittees, one to control the weight of the kilogram, a second to com pare the scales used in the work with the old toise, and the third composed of four members calculating independently?to deduce the length of the meter from the cornucopia of measurements made by Mechain and Delambre. Their calculations fixed the definitive meter over-precisely at 443.295936 lignes of the toise de Peru taken at 17.6?C, some 0.144 lignes shorter than the provisional meter by then distributed throughout France. (The difference was meaning less for commerce, since it amounted to one foot in a kilometer.) Independent observers had nothing but praise for Borda's circle and for the care with which the units of volume and weight were deduced from the meter and the density of water.69 68.

No echo of this discordant and irrelevant observation was heard in the speeches on June 22, 1799, when the joint committees formally presented the prototype standards to the people. In accepting them, the president of the upper legislative body, the Conseil des anciens, remarked that it was a work of genius to have found an inviolable base of measurement in nature; "that, citizens, is the immortal service that the National Institute has rendered to the French Republic, or 70 rather, the benefit that it offers to the entire human race." It remained only to convince the race to accept the benefit. Resistance The experts returned to their countries encouraged to propagate the metric system at home for the improvement of commerce and the tightening of ties to France. The sort of pressure they were under appears from a hint earlier given by the Convention's Com mittee of Public Instruction to a newly liberated territory. The Com mittee pointed to the great "advantage it would be to the union just established between the French and Batavian republics to spread the system of uniform and decimal measures beyond French terri tory."71 The Cisalpine Republic, consisting of Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, also felt the pressure early. Annexed territory, such as the Departement du Mont-Tonnerre carved out of the Rhineland, felt a heavier hand. By a decree of 18 June 1801, the Departement would be obliged to use the metric system exclusively; all old weights and measures found in shops and all meter sticks on 72 which former units of length were indicated would be confiscated. In friendly but not subject territory the system was recommended for its combination of abstract science and practical utility. "We [in 70. Bugge, Science (1969), 204, and in Crosland, Stud.

"Nature and not France brings [the new measures] to us [Spaniards]. Let us accept them following our natural ally with whom we have so many commercial relations_It behooves Spain [because it helped Mechain] to set other nations the 73 example of adopting these units." None of this cajoling or commanding had much immediate effect. Even in France, where the new units were to oust the old in land transactions on 1 Vendemiaire an x (September 23, 1801), the people declined to benefit from the republican measures created ostensibly in their interest.74 One of the orators at the presentation of the prototypes in July 1799 had imagined the satisfaction a peasant would feel in computing his holdings in square meters. "The field that supports my children is such and such a fraction of the globe. In that proportion I am a co-owner of the world."75 In practice the peasant and his surveyor, builder, and draper, refused to give up their toise sticks. So brutish a rejection of the natural and the rational perplexed the savants. "There is no respect in which the reform of weights and measures has not been advanta geous," declared the president of the Agricultural Society of Paris (Societe d'agriculture de Paris) in 1809, "and, consequently, if rea son always were listened to, the success of the reform would have been complete." Alas, the meter had only complicated ordinary life. Artisans brought home their measures in familiar units and sat up all night converting them into meters, and into a crowd of irrelevant decimals, in order to write estimates and contracts in the obligatory figures. Why did they not measure in meters to begin with and enjoy "the happy effects of the most useful of the gifts that seien 77 tists have been able to make to society"? Because they were 73.

According to a British metrol ogist, who had it from a French merchant, consumers opposed the new units on the theory that they would be an advantage to shop keepers, and shopkeepers opposed them for fear that consumers would be able to figure out true costs. The government hoped that a play with words would overcome suspicion. On November 4, 1800, it allowed the use of old words for multiples of the new measures, for example, "toise" for "two meters," "pinte metrique" for "litre," and so on. The reformers thought the concession damaging and absurd: if the people could use Greek words like "Chirurgien" and 79 "apothecaire," why not "kilogramme"? Because the people did not like change and cared nothing for system. So stubborn and irrational were they that in 1812 the imperial government sacrificed the jewel of the reform, the key to democracy, that is, reckoning by tens. The sacrifice had the appro val of Napoleon, who himself had difficulty with the metric system. The cartographers of the Depot de la guerre, who synthesized into a uniform "Carte de l'Empereur" the maps and plans of Germany scavanged by the ingenieurs geographes, had to put in scales in toises as well as meters; and Napoleon insisted that the maps made from Tranchot's data be drawn in the Cassini scale of 1:86400 rather than on the metric scale of 1:100000. "I don't care a fig for your decimal divisions," he said to the map makers, who knew who was in charge. "It is true," they said among themselves, "that this scale [of toises] does not agree perfectly with the decimal system; but it suits His Majesty."80 Two laws, of February 12 and March 28, 1812, indicate the state of affairs. The first ordered that the official system be taught in all schools throughout the empire, that it alone be used in public administration, markets, and commercial transactions. The second 78.

Our British metrolo gist enjoyed the spectacle: "Thus, after twenty years of trouble, mystery, and litigation, no advances are made, except that of having one common standard."81 Otherwise confusion had only been com pounded: the puzzled citizen had the provisional meter of 1795, the definitive of 1799, the compromised names of 1801, the common system of 1812, and, unofficially and omnipresent, the ancient units of the Kings of France. It is easy to change governments, not hard to reform currency, but almost impossible to alter the most common weights and measures. "Nothing has a greater tendency to grow worse, or more obstinately resists improvement." One took the long view. "This new metric system, all of whose parts fit together so simply, will no doubt triumph in the end over the obstacles that habit still opposes to its general adoption," so reads a text of 1820, "especially if it continues to be obligatory."82 Spread A gauge of the rate of penetration of the new units is the pattern of their use in books requiring specification of units, like atlases, compendia of architectural drawings, and manuals of surveying, building, and engineering. Although such works employing old units exclusively were published into the 19th century,83 most presented measurements and calculations in both meters and toises and their multiples. A good indication for the early years is the col lection of architectural designs awarded prizes by the Institut de France and other government bodies between 1795 and 1803. Forty of these designs have units: three use toises only, two use meters only, and the balance use both. Before 1800 toises have priority when both scales are present; after 1800, meters.84 A collection of 81.

About 30 percent of the plans use toises only; another 30 percent, meters only; and 40 percent, both. All the plans are dated, the earli est to 1815; the strongest showing of the toise against the meter occurs not at the beginning, but in the period 1835-1839. The meter takes over after 1840, the year in which the metric system at last became obligatory in France.86 Up-to-date technical manuals show the same equivocation as architectural drawings. An authoritative indicator is the huge treatise on the building arts (four volumes in five of text, three of plates) published between 1805 and 1816 by Jean-Baptiste Ron delet, chief architect of the church of Sainte-Genevieve and archi tectural consultant to the government. Rondelet's plates strongly favor the old measures; his text appears to be the work of a schizo phrenic. The earliest volume (1805) uses pieds, pouces, and lignes and also metric units, sometimes converted but often not, in tables and in calculations; at one point it gives dimensions in meters and 87 computes in toises. In the volumes published in 1812, Rondelet usually proffers all dimensions in both the old and new style, but without the advantage of decimal notation: for example, "31 pieds 3/7 (10 metres 209 millimetres)." His preference for the old appears from his way of obtaining specific gravity, which he understands as the weight in grams of a cubic centimeter of a substance. He meas ures the weight of a sample, in air and in water, in onces and gros, deduces the weight of a cubic pied, and converts to the metric sys tem. The preference for the old units persists into the last volumes, 85. Bruyere, Etudes (1823). 86. Lemmonier and Normand, Paris moderne (1843); Bouchard, Prieur (1946), 313.

Then?after 1,839 pages of schizophrenic com putations, the last of which provides the cost of old bricks in old money?Rondelet introduces some "notions about metric meas 88 ures." It is instructive that this instruction precedes a recomputa tion of costs in metric measures and decimalized currency. The rela tive ease of such computations was the great benefit that the reformers had advertised. From about 1810 many technical manuals by professors and government officials used metric measures exclusively. For example, the professor of mathematics at the Ecole imperiale militaire, Louis Puissant, and Pierre Pommies, professor at the Lycee Napoleon, both influential teachers of surveying and geodesy, used meters exclusively and without explanation in many textbooks beginning in 89 1807. Jean-Nicolas Hachette, professor at the Ecole polytechnique, brought the metric system into the preface of his textbook on machines, without comment, as the only satisfactory way "to express their effect in numbers." The chemist Jean-Antoine Chaptal, one-time minister of the interior and long-time educational reformer, naturally used nothing but modern measures in his survey of the state of French industry after the fall of Napoleon. Still there are hints of backsliding where least expected. The official surveyors of France might have worked exclusively in meters and understood the higher geodesy; but the local land measurer often enough made do with old units and little geometry into the reign of Louis Phi lippe. A manual for such measurers, "especially people who have not studied geometry," was published in 1833 by an inspector of the cadastral survey. It contains an explanation of the metric sys tem, an injunction to use it, and tables for the easy conversion of old local measures into meters, "and vice versa."90 As it spread, the metric system did help to realize the reformers' ambition to improve the numeracy of Europeans. In the Ancien Regime, despite its baroque abundance of metrological units, most people had need only for a single system; during the Empire, because of the government's policy of driving the meter home, 88.

If the first advance of European "Rechenhaftigkeit"?"the inclination, habit, and ability to resolve the world into numbers and to bring these numbers together into an artificial system of income and outgo"?may be likened to literacy in one language, the domestication of the metric system made reckon ers bilingual.91 The early treatises on metric calculations introduced not only decimal arithmetic, including the concept of place, but also the idea of significant figures and the operation of rounding off. An Exposi tion abregee du nouveau Systeme, published in the provinces in 1802 or 1803, may stand for the genre. It explains that the many decimals generated during conversion are artifacts of multiplication and division, and demands that they be dropped from the final 92 answer. Rounding off, says Rondelet, in his belated account of metric computations, is essential to the new system. Rounding off might in practice mean only rounding up, as readers of an Arithmetique pratique of 1800, which recommends changing 0.7411440 to 0.75, learned to do; a practice that would favor shop keepers, who could round up each of their many small transac 93 tions. Even arithmetic has its social bias. The utility of metric conversions in teaching numeracy appears further from popular textbooks of arithmetic that use such computations as exercises. This practice persisted long after the universal adoption of the metric system in France.94 According to the president of the Paris Agricultural Society, the great majority of people who could read and write in 1810 knew nothing more of arithmetic than addition and subtraction. He had a prescription for correcting this innumeracy and a vision of the happy consequences. "If decimal calculations could be introduced into primary schools along with the use of the new measures, not 91. Quote from Sombart, Der Bourgeois (1913), 164. 92.
