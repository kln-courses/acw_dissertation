Dandekar, M.A., Ph.D. Paradoxical as it may seem, one will all the same be justified in saying that the Vedic researches have been the earliest and the richest among the indological researches and still the unsol- ved Vedic problems are greatest in number among the indologi- cal problems. Particularly the field of Vedic mythology cannot be said even now to have been fully and satisfactorily exploited. The asura Varuna, for example, is the most august and greatly elevated divinity in the pantheon of Vedic gods and still his essential character remains enigmatic. This paradox may appear to be still more striking ! What is it that gave Varuna the exalted position which he holds in the Rgveda ( RV. ) ? Why, inspite of the comparatively smaller number of hymns dedicated to his praise, is he regarded, by the side of Indra, as the great* est of the gods of the RV ? Why, again, in certain cases, is he represented to be far superior to Indra - sometimes even as the God among gods ? Broadly speaking any hypothesis regarding the essential nature of a Vedic god, in order to be proper and correct, must fulfil the following conditions •* ( 1 ) We ought to be in a position to present, on the basis of that hypothesis, a complete picture of that god as far as possible * Paper read at the B.

( 2 ) From the point of view of the history of religion, the hypothesis must normally make it possible to connect that god satisfactorily with the indo-germanic ( idg ) religious thought. If, however, the conception underlying that god were to be regarded as the result of foreign influence or purely as an in- digenous growth, that fact too must be historically explainable. ( 3 ) The hypothesis must further make it possible to acc- ount reasonably for the later modifications in the nature of that god in the classical Indian mythology. ( 4 ) Finally the hypothesis must be based on sound philolo- gical grounds. Since 4 mythology is but an old form of language' all conclusions regarding the god's personality ought to be cor- roborated by definite linguistic facts. . It is intended here to make a fresh approach to the Varuna- problem on these lines. Let us first try to present, in a general way, a connected, picture of Varuna and his greatness, through a constructive analysis of the Vedic hymns directly addressed to him as well as other Vedic references. 1 Varuna is preeminently called the asura ( I. 35. 7 ; II. 27. 10 ; VII. 65.2; VIII. 42.1) and is often glorified as the upholder of the cosmic law - ria ( I. 23.5). He is rtasya gopã or rtavãn par excell- ence. His ordinances are constantly said to be fixed, which fact gives him the significant iitls-dhrtavrata. He is the regulator of waters ( II. 28.4 5 V. 85. 6 ; VII. 64. 2 ) ; indeed all natural phe- nomena are controlled and directed by this god. The gods them- selves follow Var una's law ( VIII. 41. 7 ) and are incapable of obstructing in any way the proper conduct of that law. The divine dominion of Varuna is often referred to with the word maya , occult power. On account of this maya, Varuna wields 1 The following Vedio referenoes, among others, are particularly repre- sentative of Varuça's personality and true nature : - I. 24 ; I. 25 ; V. 67. 1-2 ; VII, 86 ; VII. 87 ; VII. 88 ; VIII. 41 ; VIII. 42 ; X. 124. 3-4 ; AV. 16. About AV.

'</page><page sequence="3">Asura Varuna 159 supreme sovereignty over the whole universe, which is said to have been originally created by him. He is the imperial ruler, samrãj , of all, both gods and men ( X. 132.4 ; II, 27.10 ), of the whole world ( V. 85.3 ) and of all that exists. Not even the slightest activity in nature and in human and animal life passes unnoticed by him. The rising and the setting of the sun, the falling of rains, the growth of vegetation, the flowing of rivers, the flying of birds, even the winking of the eye are governed by the subtly working law of Varuna. In his capacity of the world- sovereign, Varuna is said to be commanding a large band of spies (I. 24.13 ; VI. 67.5; VII. 61.3 ; VII. 87.3), who being undeceived, undismayed and wise, observe keenly all the happen- ings in the universe and report to their master, without delay, any cases of lapse against and transgression of that law. The over- lord, Varuna, himself has the sun for his eye. ( I. 115.1 ; VI. 51. 1 ; VII. 61.1 ), so that he can supervise unobstructedly the happenings in the universe and the activities of human beings. Varuna's golden abode is in the highest heaven ( V. 67.2 ) ; there he occupies his seat, which is great, very lofty, and firm on account of a thousand columns. It is the duty of the all-seeing sun, together with other spies, to go to the dwelling of Varuna and report the deeds of men ( VII. 60.1 ). Varuna is the un- failing witness of men's truth and falsehood ( VII. 49.3 ). He perceives all that exists within heaven and earth and all that is beyond ; none can escape from Varuna by fleeing even far be- yond the sky ( AV. IV. 16. 4-5 ). This vast expanse of the world is not an irregular chaos. It is bound down by the pãsa of Varuna into a well-regulated whole. It is cosmos. The law of Varuna - rta - works in a subtle but most effective manner throughout the universe. This is indeed the mãyã of the great asura ! And if any perpetrator of crime against this cosmic law- and, by logical extension, also against the moral law - is found, he is forthwith punished with the pãsa of Varuna. The pãsa of Varuna, which thus seems to be serving a double purpose, is positively an exclusive feature of that god. The great asura is, therefore, approached in great awe, and prayers for mercy are addressed to him. But this world- sovereign, characterised by all the glory of an oriental ruler, is often very relentless in matters pertaining to the proper conduct</page><page sequence="4">i6o Annals oj the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute of his law. It is Varuna who creates the universe and guards the cosmic law. As a moral governor also Varuna stands far above any other deity. He is the strongest barrier against every type of falsehood. This ethical idealisation is perhaps the most outstanding feature of Varuna's personality. His epithets, asura mãyin , dhrtavrata , rtavãn etc. point to the same essential nature. Another significant peculiarity of Varuna is his special asso- ciation with Mitra and the Ädityas. Mitra and Varuna are often inseparably bound to each other ; and Varuna is represented, in the Veda, as the highest among the Ädityas. Together with them he forms an independent circle of Vedic divinities, to whom is principally entrusted the guardianship of law - cosmic and moral. Their main characteristic is not the achievement of enormous exploits, as in the case of Indra ; they govern the law which regulates the whole universe. A very striking parallel of this circle of Vedic gods is found in the Avestan religion where Ahura Mazdah, Mithra and Amesa Spentas also form a similar group. They too represent the supreme heavenly sovereignty. The eminence of Varuna as the creator of the universe, as the world-sovereign, as the protector of law, andas the moral go- vernor of mankind, had developed, in the Veda, to such an enor- mous extent that there naturally arose a unique rivalry for supremacy between him and Indra, the other paramount god of the Vedic pantheon. Several Vedic references are indicative of this rivalry which forms unquestionably one of the most impor- tant features of the Vedic mythology. It may be mentioned, in this context, that in marked contrast with Indra and many other Vedic gods, Varuna has no myths related of him ; consequently the anthropomorphism of his personality is more fully developed on the spiritual rather than the physical side. The personality of Varuna is shrouded, in the Veda, with a mysterious and majestic grandeur. His unapproachable magni- ficence and awe-inspiring power, his inexorable austerity and incomprehensibly divine wisdom inspire the Vedic seer to a A anxious but commanding worship and self-abnegation rather than to expressions of frank and friendly confidence. All traces of human weakness that are clearly perceptible in the character of Indra are conspicuously absent in Varuna's character. The seer of &amp; Vedio passage seems to have summarised substantially the</page><page sequence="5">Asura Varuna i6i true Vedic character of Varuna when he says of him, ( VII. 87.6. ). What conclusions regarding the personality and the essential nature of Varuna can be drawn from the Vedic evidence adduced above ? Does Varuna, like many other Vedic gods, represent any power of nature and, if so, which ? Can we trace the concep- tion underlying this god to other idg. religions ? How did the personality of this god develop in the later Hindu mythology ? Before directly approaching these problems regarding the Vedic god, Varuna, in a constructive manner, we may begin by critically examining the several earlier theories about Varuna by applying to them the tests mentioned above. The most common view, put forth by soBolars like Eoth, Darmesteter, Hopkins, Bohnenberger, L. von Schröder and Bloom- field, is to regard Varuna as the sky-god. Even Hillebrandt had originally subscribed to this view, though he later on revised his opinion. This theory is mainly based on the name Varuna, which is derived by these scholars from the root vf, 4 to cover ' or 4 to encompass To ťtífc simple minds of the ancient peoples, it was argued by them, the sky actually seemed to be covering or encompassing the earth and all that it contained. Those ancient people accepted unhesitatingly the impressions conveyed to them by their senses and the blue vault of the sky was for them actually a vault, solid and immutable, covering everything. It was further believed that this theory was sub- stantially corroborated by the apparent identity, from the philo- logical point of view, of the two names, Varuna and Ouranos, the Greek sky-god. Varuna was, according to these scholars, none other than the Vedic counterpart of Greek Ouranos. There was, however, already one sky-god in the Vedic pantheon, namely Dyauö. This god can be shown, on the strength of philological and mythological evidence, to have been common to almost all idg. religions. What then was the necessity of a second sky-god ? Schröder explains this contingency by saying that Dyaus and Varuna represent two different aspects of the sky. Dyaus represents the bright and shining day-sky, while in Varuna, the pervading and the all-encompassing nature of the sky is particularly emphasised. Varuna may be said to be the 4 firmament 1 in contrast to Dyaus, which is the 4 shining sky. '</page><page sequence="6">1 62 Annals of the Bhandarkat Oriental 'Research Institute Since this encompassing or pervading nature is conspicuously realisable through the starry vault of the night-sky, Varuna is closely associated with the night in RV-hymns. It was sugges* xed by Schroder that when Indians and Iranians lived together as one common cultural group, they glorified a sky-god as the creator of the universe. Varuna and Ahura Mazdah, whose common mythological heritage can hardly be questioned, are the two independent developments of this original Aryan god. RV.- passages like *T &lt;TT* WPT7T ^ *r fsr»gr i ïtw a?r 3«n$rerf sir n ( VIII. 41.3 ) sis snpcrm»r% 11 ( VIII. 41.7 ) ťrteřt *rrâr ffrifřrr řrj# irikro: I *T5ŤT q# fèrnipi gir M ( VII. 87.5 ) however would clearly indicate that the Vedic Varuna is defini- taly closer in conception to that original sky-god of the Aryans. Ahura Mazdah, on the other hand, was, in later times, greatly spiritualised and idealised by Zarathusthra in his reform-move- ment. Bortholomae, Darmesteter, Eggers, and Spiegel maintain, all the same, that Ahura Mazdah also is the abstraction of the idea of sky. In Avesta, varem is the name of a mythological land which is said to be cathrugaosha. The linguistic affinity between the words, Varuna and vařena, is, supposed to be quite evident. This mythological locality is, according to some scho- lars, to be identified with the expanse of the sky ' with its four corners. ' It may be remembered, in this connection, that, in the Veda, Varuna too is said to be caturanika. This was considered as another piece of evidence in favour of the sky-theory. Attem- pts have also been made to connect the word Varuna philologi- cally with Armenian ( Arm. ) garuna which means the bright sky. In the course of time, however, there began, in the evolu- tion of the Vedic religious thought, the process of spiritualisa- tion, which all nature-gods had to undergo at some stage of their</page><page sequence="7">Asura V atutía 1 6$ career, Varuna thus rose from the 4 sky 9 to be the ,4 god of the sky ,' presiding over all the natural phenomena of which the sky is the foundation and the scene ; and in the later development he was finally regarded as the supreme embodiment and guardian, as well as the maker of the law, which controlled those phenomena of nature. The transition from the guardianship of the cosmic order to that of the moral order was then merely a matter of logical extension* It is even boldly suggested that such a deve- lopment of the Varuna-conception might have been in the mind of Kant when he said : 4 Zwei Dinge erfüllen das Gemüt mit immer neuer und zunehmender Bewunderung, je öfter und anhaltender sich das Nachdenken damit bes- chäftigt : Der bestirnte Himmel über mir und das moralische Gesetz in mir ! ' The sun is described, in the Veda, to be thé eye of Varuna ( 1. 115.1 ; VI. 51.1 ; VII. 61.1 ), which can be best understood if Varuna were regarded as the sky-god. Max Müller recognises, in the physical Varuna only the 4 starry ' night-side, while Knauer, who connects the name Varuna with varria , 'black colour/ emphasises ' darkness 9 as the main characteristic of that god and therefore identifies Varuna with the 4 night-sky 9 of the ur-idg. period. It must be said with regard to this theory, which primarily identifies Varuna with Greek Ouranos and thus regards him as a sky-god, that it is based on a fundamentally incorrect ety- mology. It will be found that all derivatives, in the ^-themes, from the root vr% 4 to cover, ' with which the Gk. word, Ouranos, is usually philogically connected, always show a long vowel ; for instance, Sk. varütar , varutra , varütha , as also Gk. rutõr , rütér eruto. If therefore the word Varuna were to be derived from the root vr, 4 to cover,' one would naturally expect to find 4 varuria with long ru. Even Schroder, who is a strong protagonist of the sky-theory, himself confesses that there are objections, based also on phonetic grounds, to the acceptance of the equation, Varuna = Ouranos. Macdonell quotes in his Vedic Mythology the view of Joh. Schmidt, namely, that it was not so easy, as it would seem, to connect Varuna linguistically with Ouranos. Lately the French scholar, Dumézil, has again assumed the identity of Varuna and Ouranos, but he derives those two words from quite a different root and consequently draws quite a differ- ent conclusion regarding the personality of Varuna. As regards</page><page sequence="8">164 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute the suggestion that Vedio Varuna may be connected with Arm. gar una, Hübschmann has clearly shown that those words háve hardly anything to do with each other from the philological point of view. Moreover, the original meaning of the word, gar urn , is the ' spring 9 and not the 4 sky. ' Apart from this basic etymological flaw, the sky-theory further suffers from another grave defect, namely, that it cannot fully and rationally explain the special characteristics of Varuna as described in the Veda. The foremost difficulty in this con- nection arises from Varuna's close association with Mitra and; the Ãdifcyas. Even in the Boghazköi inscription the reference to Varuna is made as ù-ru-wa-iia-as-si-el9 meaning 'Varuna together with his group. ' So also, Ahura Mazdah is praiöed in the Avesta as being constantly associated with Mithra and the Amesa Spentas. This conception of a special circle of divinities over which Varuna seems to have presided, would not fit properly in the sky-theory. Further even on the assumption that Mitra primarily represents the sun-god - this assumption will be latex on shown to be positively wrong- the pairing of Mitra and Varuna would appear to be without any special significance. The plea put forfch by Schröder, in this connection, namely that the sun and the sky always appear together and may therefore form a pair of constant companions, is not at all convincing. Further how can one explain, in that case, the contrast between Mitra and Varuna, so emphatically implied in a large number of Vedic passages, such as, fìnrt 3TfTsnnT5?r^irt *rràr&gt;s( T. S. IV. 4.8.3 ) ? Moreover nowhere else in the Vedic literature does one find any indication of a dual divinity like dyãvãmryau, which would correspond completely with miträvarüfuiu. It is interesting to note here that Schröder himself later on feels inclined to give up the hypothesis that Mitra represents the sun-god. The rivalry between Indra and Varuna, which certainly was a favourite theme of the Vedic poets, is also rendered meaningless if Varuna were made to represent the sky-god. Whether, in the naturalistic interpretation of the Vedic mythology, which is, by the way, not necessarily always correct, Indra were to be regard- ed as the sun-god, or as the storm-god, one fails to understand' why there should be any rivalry between him and the sky-god !</page><page sequence="9">Asura Varuna 165 Further the Vedic passages adduced in support of the sky-4 theory, such as, fNřt srrir r%i%ar srffRŘíH ( VII. 87. 5 ) sfir "T Ti%^r ( IX. 73. 8 ) etc are of suoh a general tenor that one comes across similar passages with reference to Parjanya ( VII. 102.4 ) or the Ãdityas (AV. XIII. 2.3). On the other hand, one may consider , with advantage the following Vedic passages referring to Varuna ; sa* ^roir srKN1 wra: «T ( VII. 87 .6) fr *rg*r aráteregÍT ^im^r fr nnrr srrëmr q^^orracïrraïw&amp;ss... ( VIII. 41.8 ). Are the phrases dyiuriva sthãd, drapso na švelah, dyãmiva rohatí, and riãkam ãruhat , in any way indicative of the sky ? Can the sky be called apicyah samudrab. ? How is it further possible to explain, with the sky-hypothesis, the Vedic passages where Varuna is connected with Yama ( X. 14.7 ), with manyu ( X. 84. 7 ), with papa ( I. 24. 11 ), and with dhürti ( I. 128. 7 ) ? No other idg. religion has elavate d the sky-god to the exalted position of the g jardianship of the cosmic and moral order, which is one of the essential characteristics of Varuna in the Veda and of Ahura Mazdah in the Avesta. The ' father-sky ' - dyaus-pitar, Jupiter,- is no doubt represented in every idg. mythology but he has his own restricted domain ancUhis own place, albeit sufficien- tly high in the pantheon. It is further not clear why Varuna, the sky-god, should be idealised in the peculiarly ethical dir- ection and not Dyaus, the sky-god ? The conceptions of rtíãyã and ria, with which the Vedic Varuna is associated in a special manner, lose all their essential significance on the assumption of Varuna' s being identical with the sky. What again are we to understand by the pãèa of Varuna, according to this theory Î It must be remembered at the same time that in later Indian liter- ature we do not find any trace of Varuça representing the sky. It will thus be seen that none of the above-mentioned four con- ditions is even slightly fulfilled by the sky-theory, which fact therefore renders it unacceptable. Other modifications of this "theory, such as, that Varuna represents the ur-idg. ' night-sky ' ( Knauer ), or that he represents the ' starry vault of the sky ' 2 [ Atiaals, B. O. R. I. ]</page><page sequence="10">I¿f Annals oj the Èhandarkar Oriental Řesearch Institutè ( Max Müller ) may now be dismised without any further discussion. J. J. Meyer has suggested, in his work on legal literature of ancient India, that Varuna is principally the god of night. 1 The sins and crimes are usually perpetrated during the night-time and as the god of night, it is Varuna's function lo prevent them. It is in this way, argues Meyer, that Varuna becomes the moral governor of mankind. Another quite a novel theory about Varuna is put forth by Johansson in his very thought-provoking monograph on the Vedic goddess, Dhisanã. He believes that the names Varuna and Vrtra are derived from the same idg. form *uel-lu , 1 to bind ' 4 to keep under chains. ' This fact would indicate the commonness of their nature. According to Johans- son, Varuna and Vrtra are the two aspects of ' winter, * which keeps the waters of rivers in bondage, one divine aspect and the other demonaic ! Bergaigne too claims an especially tenebrious character for Varuna. He sees in him a clear identity with Vptra, who is the ' restrainer 9 of waters. Varuna's pãéa is, acc- ording to Bergaigne, indicative of the tying down of waters. The rivalry between Varuna and Indra is therefore only another aspect of the conflict between Vrtra and Indra. Varuna's pãéa is the symbolical representation of the power of winter by means of which the waters are fettered. Certain stray references like hemanto hi varuyah ( M. S. 1. 10.12 ), or such possible conjectures as that the varuriapraghasa sacrifice was performed on the eve of winter, are adduced by Johansson in support of his theory. As Sörensen has rightly pointed out, while contradicting the identification of Varuna with Vrtra, Varuna is represented, in the Veda* as the lord and friend of waters and not even the slightest hint is given to the effect that he prevents them from flowing, as Vrtra does. Further a critical examination of the Vedic hymns would indicate that Vrtra and Indra on the one hand and Mitra and Varuna on the other belong to two distinct i • The conception of Varuça as the god of night seems to be the more primary conception Varunia represents the moon-lit magic night... Night, the night-sky, and the moon are Very closely connected with each other... ' -~J. J. Meyer : Uber das Wesen der altindischen Rechtschriften, pp. 379-385.</page><page sequence="11">Asura Varum 167 types of mythologies. Though therefore the names Vrtra and Varuna may possibly have been derived from the same root, the conceptions underlying them have to be thoroughly distinguish- ed from each other, from the point of view of content as well aù the history of religion. Moreover a mere reference to some of the outstanding features of Varuna, as described in the Veda, would suffice to disprove completely such views as have beeij put forth by Meyer and Johansson. The very suggestion that either the god of night or the winter-god could be raised to such an exalted position in any religion is preposterous. These and such other theories 1 seem to disregard completely the evidence l A reference may be made, in this context, to other theories regarding the true nature of the Vedio god, Varuna, advanced by Johansson and Meyer themselves ; * The most prominent god of fertility in ancient India was Varu$a in this respect he was regarded as the god of the whole community and parti- cularly of the Ksatriyas Varuna consequently represented the essential element of royal power Varuita was the god who governed the change of seasons and was therefore the god of the year, possessing two aspects of Varuça and Dyaus ( Mitra ? ). Where he is not represented anthropomor- phic&amp;lly, he is represented as a horse ..The feminine counterpart of Varuiia is mother earth- Aditi or Ppthvl.., Probably Aditi was primarily the wife of Varuria ' -Johansson : Über die altindische Göttin DhisartS and Verwandtes, pp. 108 ff. • Varuna was primarily chthonic vegetation-god and phallic divinity his connection with waters which cause growth and life is particularly em- phasised he is the lord of water and rains Already as the god of the earth he is the king and therefore also the god of law and puoishiment In EV he ascends to the sky ( not necessarily first then ), becomes the lord of atmospheric ocean and makes the rain-waters stream down he is now turned into the heavenly sovereign-lord of the universe and the upholder of the T*a next he is regarded as the moon-god, because, on the one hand, he is the lord of night, and because, on the other, he and Soma, both divini- ties of water and vegetation, are identical Varuna's dreary and fri- ghtful nature and his lordship over the dead seem to have developed out of his original chthonic nature this is how the Varuça-mythology seems to have evolved in India -J. J. Meyer : Trilogie der altindischen Mächte und Feste der Vegetation, pp, 269ff. Evidently both Joharsson and Meyer are not quite sure about the essen- tial nature and personality of Varuiia. They do not seem tc reconstruct the picture of the Vedic Varuria in a synthetical manner from the special and esolusive attributes of that god. Particularly Meyer appears, of recent years, ( Continued on next page )</page><page sequence="12">i &lt;68, Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute of the Veda ; they do not take into account the logical develop- ment of the religious thought among the idg. people in general and among the Vedic Aryans in particular ; and finally they are not confirmed by linguistic facts, which those scholars claim to be supporting their theories. Oldenberg ( Die Religion des Veda ) comes forth, as usual, with a refreshingly original theory in this regard. The physical representations of Varuna, Mitra and the Ãdityas bear, accord- ing to him, several distinct attributes of light. The same is the case with regard to the corresponding circle of divinities in the Avesta, namely, Ahura Mazdah, Mithra and the Amesa Spentas. Oldenberg starts with the assumption that the fact that Mithra of the Avesta definitely represents the sun-god is unchallenge- able. The Vedic counterpart of Mithra, namely Mitra, must therefore necessarily be the sun-god. Though independent references to Mitra are not many in the RV, still Oldenberg claims to find faint traces of his identity with the sun-god even in the existing material. In III. 59, for instance, general expres- sions have been used which indicate, acoording to Oldenberg, without any specific mention, the connection of Mitra with the sun. More direct references in this connection are found in the AV: sr sreor vwih * ftr^r wfir ' ('AV. XIII. 3.13 ) sn HT cçssrg 1 ( AV. IX. 3.18 ). In the Brahmaria literature there are numerous passages of a similar tenor, where Varuna is said to belong to the night and ( continued from the previous page ) to have been considerably influenced by the vegetation-fertility-conception. In his reoent book. ' Trilogie der altindisohen Mächte etc, * he represents KSma, Bali and Indra as anoient Indian gods of vegetation and fertility. Mention may also be made of the theory put forth by N. N. Ghose ( Aryan trail in India and Iran ) that Mitra and Varuna were originally an inseparable pair like the Aávins and that they represented the same twin principles of Light and Moisture. According to Ghose these twin prin- ciples were worshipped under, different designations amongst different tribes of Proto-Aryan grass-land nomads. He further maintains that through fusion of tribes, Mitra and Varuna beoame maintainors of Law. Obviously the Vedic evidence çannot be said to be, in any way, substantiating {his theory.</page><page sequence="13">Asura Varuna 169 Mitra. to the day. Ritualistically Varuna is connected with blaok animal and Mitra with bright-coloured animals. The common concept of day and night- "Corresponding with Mitra and Varuna, respectively- repeats itself very often in the sacrificial formulas. The essential nature of Mitra as the sun-god is thus confirmed, according to Oldenburg, by Vedic as well as Avestan literary and ritualistic evidence. Varuna is the constant companion of Mitra ; the association of Mitra with Varuna iš so predominant that only one single hymn of the RV is addressed to Mitra alone. Oldenberg's line of argumentation is as follows: There is in the Vedic mythology a compact group of seven, mutually-con- nected gods, namely, the Ãdityas, who are conspicuously dep- endent upon sky and light. Two from among them, Mitra and Varuna, have assumed more preeminent forms. One of these two, namely Mitra, is definitely the sun-god, while the other one, Varuna, has the features of a god of light with special reference to night, over whioh he is said to rule. What else can he possibly represent if not the moon ? The logical extension of the hypothesis that Mitra is the sun-god, and Varuna is the moon-god naturally was that the Ãdityas represent the planets. Besides this hypothesis there is also another side to Oldenberg's theory. The glorification of the sun, the moon, and the planets as a compact group of mutually-connected gods, which is to be seen in the Veda and the Avesta, cannot be traced baok to any other idg. religion. There are therefore two possibilities regard- ing the genesis of this religious conception. Either the Indo- Iranians themselves oreated this group of gods in their own common religious fervour, or they borrowed those divinities from a foreign religion. Oldenberg believes that the rather unique circle of the Ãdityas, with Varuna and Mitra as the foremost among them, is múre or less foreign to the pantheon of Vedio gods, whioh is presided over by the Aryan national war- god, Indra. According to him the Indra-Vrtra-mythology is genuinely Aryan while the Varuna-Mitra-mythology has been implanted, in the Vedic religion, from outside. Is it possible, he asks, that this unique group of gods has been borrowed by the Indo-Iranins from the Semitic people ( or the Akkadians ) and that from the very beginning it was only half understood by the borrowers ? The fact that the Semitio people were well-</page><page sequence="14">1 70 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute versed in the science of astronomy and of numbers, from the very ancient times, seems to support considerably this conjec- ture. Moreover there is much other evidence to show that the Semitic people had developed a sufficiently high type of civilisa- tion before the Indo-Iranians came in contact with them. The god Varuna, whom the Aryans are supposed to have borrowed from the Semitic mythology, does appear, by the side of the Aryan national god, Indra, as a representative of an older and distinctly higher culture. The apparent reasonableness and soundness of this moon- theory of Oldenberg made even Hillebrandt ( Vedische Mythologie) revise his original judgment in the matter of the Varuna-pro- blem. His method of approach to this question was however different from that of Oldenberg. He attempts to bring forth evidence in support of his theory from within rather than from without. One fact must all the same be clearly recognised in both these cases - and that is certainly a defect in the process of theorisation - namely that Oldenberg and Hiliebrandt first form some idea about Varuna's original nature and then try to adduce evidence in support of that idea. They seem to start with con- clusions rather than end with them. Hillebrandt considers the Vedic passages, such as, ara sr^itr srrfor «T » ( VII. 87.6 ) &lt;er ^rgir *t?t% *r wrar ( VIII. 41.8 ) as clearly indicative of Varuna's identity with the moon. Api • cyah samudrah is according to him the usual epithet of the moon. But more convincing evidence in this connection is to be found in the ninth mandala of the RV. In the passage, Tifft g à gční»r ff a; »pftf «ra tftw «Tm I fTOÎfr: 3TT% finir * 11 ( I. 91.3 ) Soma is compared with Mitra and Aryaman ; the juxtaposition of te and varuqasya in the first pada, on the other hand, clearly implies that Soma is here considered to be identical with Varuna. Sometimes even the name Varuna seems to have been used as a synonym pf Soma ; for instance,</page><page sequence="15">Ášura Varuná ifî á U^5TT«T 5T fTRT ří srpr^rnŤ waT g^ÌT íkar nws ^oř li ( IX. 95.4). Further Soma and Varuna are emphatically described as kavi in the Vedic hymns.

In ritual also, at the beginning of the agnisthoma sacrifice, Soma is treated as Varuna. The sovereignly of Varuna is perfectly identical with that of Soma. A considerable amount of Vedic literary and ritualistic evidence can thus be adduced to indicate that in the minds of the Vedio thinkers, Varuna and Soma were quite identical. Hillebrandt claims to have proved, finally and convincingly, that Soma represents the moon. The logical con* elusion therefore is that Varuna also represents the moon. This fact is amply corroborated, according to Hillebrandt, by the wealth of material, indicative of the contrast between Mitra and Varuna, in the Vedic hymns as well as in the Vedio ritual ( A. B. III. 4.6 ; T. S. VI, 6.3.5 ). It must be remembered that Hill- ebrandt unhesitatingly accepts the identification of Mitra with the sun-god. He however believes that Ahura Mazdah of the Avesta has nothing to do with Varuna. Otherwise, he argues, the name Varuna would have been retained in the Iranian lan- guage in some form or another. The probable question with regard to the moon-theory, namely, why Ahura Mazdah does not show, in the Avesta, even the faintest traces of the moon- god, has thus been anticipated and answered away by Hillebr- andt. Much emphasis has been placed by him on the sSťra-passage where Varuna is supposed to be described as ' bald, yellow-eyed, whitish man, who stands among the waters and receives the offerings on his head. ' Can there be, he asks, a more picture- sque representation of the moon than this one ? Varuna' s asso- ciation with the night is too evident to need special discussion. A further peculiarity of Varuna is that he is connected with</page><page sequence="16">i ya Annals o f the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute waters as well as with winter. Is the moon not described in a Vedic passage as the sender of rains ( A. B. VIII. 28.5 ) ? There are thus three most prominent characteristics in the nature of Varuna - his connection with the night, his connection with waters, and his connection with winter. The essential features of all these three are to be found together in only one entity, namely, the moon. Further the 4 dismal, ' ' dreary ' and ' dark ' features in Varuna 's personality can be adequately accounted for, according to Oldenberg and Hillebrandt, only on the mpon- hypothesis, The unique idealisation of Varuna into a sovereign -lord of the universe holding sway ovQr all aspects of natural as well as human life need not surprise anyone. As indicated by H. Lommel in Ms 4 Die alten Arier ' the moon is glorified to the same extent, in many primitive religions, as Varuna in the Veda. Oldeoberg mentions, in this connection, the indigenous Ame- rican religions as well as the Finnish mythology, wherein the moon is considered as the almighty god. Even the hymn to Nannar - the moon-god of Ur - quoted by Sayce, would remind one of a prayer addressed to Varuna by the Väsisthas ! This theory, namely that Varuna primarily represents the moon, first propounded by Oldenberg, in his distinctive manner, and later on so very ably supported by Hillebrandt and accepted by Hardy and others, is apparently quite sound and therefore may not be lightly set aside as of no account. But it cannot certainly stand a keen and critical examination. Attention has already been drawn to the fundamentally defective method of approach on the part of Oldenberg and Hillebrandt. It is not the evidence of the Veda itself that has led these scholars to the hypothesis which they have put forth ; their theory princi- pally depends upon extraneous circumstances and they have only later on tried to adduce such evidence from the Veda as would fit in with their hypothesis. Apart from this, it must be said that the very first assumption, namely that Mitra represents the jsun-god, which is the starting point of this theory, can be shown, on the strength of the evidence of comparative philology and •comparative mythology, to be positively wrong. Let us pause i&gt;ere a little to consider the name Mitra and the conception underlying it. Only one full hymn in RV., III. 59, is dedicated to the praise of this god exclusively. The Vedic evidence on the</page><page sequence="17">Asura Varuna whole seems to show that Mitra did not possess any individua- lity on the physical side. His special characteristic feature is expressed, in the Veda, through the words * ftrir zwi&amp;mmk yrror ( III- 59- 1 ) 4 Mitra places the men, through his commands, in their proper places. ' A clear hint is hereby given that Mitra has something to do with 4 right 7 and 4 law. ' He is primarily the yãtayajjana. This idea is further confirmed by other Vedic passages, which connect Mitra very significantly with dharman and ria : mír TOŘT i ( V. 81.4 ) &lt;T3T 3*7 THST** WPT: I ( VIII. 52.3) 5R*rq; rasr i ( X. 8.4 ). As against this, there is not the slightest evidence in the Veda to indicate that Mitra was originally the Sun-god. Etymologi- cally the original form of the word Mitra seems to have been mitram ( neuter ) formed with the suffix- tra, which, in its turn, is the modification of the idg. instrumental suffix - tro . Other formations of a similar character are vrtram from the root vr , yotram from the root yu, and yantram from the root yam. The base of the original idg. form *mi-tro-m was the idg. root 4 to bind ' The game root is clearly perceptible in the words, Sk. mekhalã , Lett, meimuri , Gk. mitos , mitre, 4 girdle of the body7. The word mitram thus originally indicates a 4 bond ' or * binding together,' and secondarily a 4 friendly bond ' A further modi- fication from this was mitrah ( masc. ) meaning the agent of bondage or the 4 binder Uhlenbeck derives mitra from mayate , while some scholars are inclined to connect mitra with Lat. milis 4 mild,' Lit. mylimas , 'beloved'. These suggestions are definitely unacceptable, as shown by Brugmann and Eisler, since the suffix - tro clearly goes against them. The Avestan expres- sions like mithrem jan, mithrem drvj also indicate that the ori- ginal conception underlying the word mithra was that of binding together or of the binder. Mitra, and also Mithra in his original nature, may therefore be looked upon as a god essentially con- nected with 4 contract, ' 4 treaty ' ' agreements. 9 Had Mitra really anything to do with the sun-god, the RV-hymns, which often sing very enthusiastically about light and splendour^ 3 [ Annals B. O. R. I. ]</page><page sequence="18">174 Annaìs of the Bhandarkat Oriental Research institute would have certainly bestowed upon him, before anything else, the epithets indicative of light and splendour 1 That is however not the case, since, as seen above, RV connects Mitra mainly with law and order. The sun is itself said to be the eye of Mitra. The later development of the Avestan Mithra into a sun-god is due to several causes. He has inherited the features of several mythologies. As Geiger has pointed out there are in him some distinct features of the Vedic Indra ; so too some in- fluence of the Semetic sun-god, gamas, is clearly perceptible in the later development of Mitra. Zarathushtra seems to have changed the old original god and forced upon him new religious conceptions. The Vedic Mitra, on the other hand, has remained true to the Aryan prototype - namely that of the god presiding over contracts and agreements, and thus preserving law and order mainly among human beings. The analysis of the Vedic references to Mitra, made by Schröder ( Arische Religion ) clearly indicates that he never represents the sun-god in the Vedic religion. It is in his capacity of the divine guardian of truth and law among men that, in the Boghazköi inscription, mi-id - ra-as-si-él , 4 Mitra together with his group, ' is invoked to bear witness to the treaty which was concluded between Subbililiuma , the king of the Hittites and Mattiuaza , the king of Mittanni. Mitra must have also been the god by whom people used to swear, as is indicated by Gk. ma ton Mithren . The essential nature of Mitra thus being that of a god of holy law, guarding the truth in word and deed, every hypothesis based upon the equation, Mitra = sun-god, necessarily falls to the ground. The very foundation of the Moon-theory is thus utterly unten- able. The evidence adduced by Oldenberg and Hillebrandt from the ritualistic literature, which seems to connect Mitra exclusi- vely with the day and Varuna exclusively with the night clearly seems to have been an afterthought and cannot therefore be regarded as in any way conclusive in regard to the problem of the personality of the Vedic Varuna. In the history of the re- ligious thought of the Aryans, light-symbolism would appear to have come in, in an emphatic manner, at a later stage only. Apart from this basic flaw, the moon-theory is not at all supported by the evidence of the Vedîc hymns. Attention has already been drawn to the absurdity of the sun being mentioned</page><page sequence="19">Asura Varuna 175 as the eye of the moon ( I. 50.6 ). Particularly when the physi- cal image of the moon was present to the eye of the Vedic poet, such reference cannot be regarded even as poetical fantasy. Further it would be very difficult to explain, on the basis of the moon-hypothesis, why Varuna, the moon, is regarded, in the Vedic hymns, as enormously more important than Mitra, the sun. Indeed so much richness of material, as we find with regard to the Vedic Varuna, should be impossible in the case of the moon. To justify this contingency on the strength of the evidence of some primitive religions, where the moon is apparently regarded as the almighty god, is to completely misunderstand the whole spirit of the Varuna- religion. Does the Varuna-religion, as presented in the Veda, betray even the slightest traces of such primitive character ? In Varuna, we have not to see a primitive conception such as is implied by H. Lommel. On the contrary, by the side of Indra, the national Aryan god, Varuna gives the impression of a re- presentative of an older, and a more refined culture. Can Var- una' s counterpart in the Avesta, Ahura M'azdah, be ever regard- ed as representing the moon ? The unique kind of ethical ide- alisation from the cosmic point of view, which is the most out- standing feature of the essential nature of the Vedic Varuna, as well as of Ahura Mazdah, becomes utterly meaningless in the moon-theory. Varuna's close association with ría and the rivalry between Varuna and Indra also cannot then be satisfactorily accounted for. Do we further not find that in the Vedic mytho- logy there exist the proper sun-god, Sůrya, and the proper moon-god, Candramas Î What then is the necessity of this peculiar glorification of Mitra and Varuna, as representing the sun and the moon respectively ? Had Mitra and Varuna pri- marily represented the two natural phenomena of the sun and the moon, the physical side of those gods would have been more distinctly emphasised in the Veda. But as a matter of fact that is not at all the case I Further it may be pointed out, in this connection, that Varuna does not play, in the Vedic mythology, the same role as the moon in the classical Hindu mythology. What is the significance of the mention of Mitra and Varuna in the Boghazköi inscriptions, if they merely represented the sun- god and the moon-god respectively ? They have been invoked with a special purposp ßpd must have been considered 39</page><page sequence="20">V] 6 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute having something to do with treaties and agreements. The pãêa, which forms an exclusive feature of Varuna, would create quite a major difficulty in the moon-theory. Soma is merely an intoxicating drink, which fact would be quite clear from the Vedic references. The identification of Soma with the moon can only be of a secondary character, and may be regarded as the product of poetical fancy. So Hillebrandt's assertion that Soma is primarily identical with the moon is quite unconvincing. Moreover Varuna's apparent identity with Soma, which seems to form the mainstay of Hillebrandt's hypo- thesis, can be more adequately explained by assuming that it was a conscious attempt on the part of the later Soma-priests to glorify foma by bringing him in a line with Varuna, the world- sovereign. Finally the moon-theory would appear to be utterly unacceptable when one would take into consideration the Vedic passage where Varuna and Candramas are brought together as the governor and the governed : 3^rrR WW armÍH JfiEwfa I ( I. 24. i o ). It is interesting to note that the etymology of the name Varuna has been completely overlooked by the protagonists of the moon-theory. No other idg. religion has glorified the moon-god to such a great extent as is done, according to Oldenberg and Hillebrandt, in the Aryan religion. Historically too this fact would become unaccountable. Oldenberg assumes that the whole circle of the Vedic gods-Mitra, Varuna and the Ãdityas - representing respectively the sun, the moon and the planets, as well as the corresponding circle of the Avestan divin- ités, Mithra, Ahura Mazdah, and the Amesa Spentas, have been borrowed by the Aryans from the Semitic people. If the Ãditya- oircle as a compact group were supposed to have been borrowed from the Semitic religion, there should have originally been such a group of divinities in that religion. As a matter of fact how- ever there is no such group ! The planet-divinities in Babylon do not appear at all as a group of seven. Moreover the single planet-divinities of the Semitic people, such as, Ninib, Nergal, Nèbo etc. have absolutely nothing in common with the Vedic &amp;ditjras, such as, Afyaman, Daksa, Bhaga, or with the Ayesta^</page><page sequence="21">Asura Varuna 177 Amesa Spentas, such as, Vohu manah , Asa vahišta , etc. Moreover the planets as such are regarded, in the Iranian religion, more or less as evil spirits on the side of Ahnman. The fatalism which is implied by the planets is again unknown to the Aryans. According to the hypothesis of Oldenberg, Varuna should have been identical with Sin , the moon-god of the Semitic people, and Mitra with Samas , their sun-god. In the Babylonian my- thology Sin , in contrast to the Vedic Varuna, plays a very minor role; Varuna's personality, on the other hand, exhibits many features, which are common to Samas . These facts clearly go against Oldenberg's theory. One conclusion therefore seems to be quite unchallengeable, namely, that the circle of the Ädityas cannot have been borrowed from the Semitic mythology, since there is no such compact group of divinities in the Semitic mythology. Semitic influence on the Varuna-religion of the Veda is further out of question in view of the fact that abstract thought in the direction of the 4 invisible, 1 'indefinite 'mystical* is foreign to the Semitic outlook on life. It seems to be an exclusively Aryan heritage. The Semitic people, on the other hand, are satisfied with 4 concrete ' things, with 4 numbers 7 and are rarely seen to go beyond them. The soundest method of understanding and evaluating the unknown Vedic mythological facts is, according to Pischel, to start from the known classical Hindu mythology. This method proposed by Pischel is correct but it is certainly not the only method. On the strength of the evidence of the classical Hindu mythology Pischel has put forth the theory, namely, that Varuna represents in the Veda, the god of ocean, as he does in later my- thology. 1 Varuna 's connections with waters are many and varied in the Vedic literature ( I. 181.14 ; VII. 49.3 ; IX. 90.2 ; AV. VII. 83.1 ). This fact would also confirm, according to him, the hypothesis that Varuna is primarily the lord of waters. The following Vedic passage, 1 Wilkins ( Hindu Mythology ) says, in this connection, that in the Vedio literature, Varuna was not represented chiefly as the god of the ocean; rather Vedic hymns show him as one of the gods of light, 'yet there are passages which describe him as being connected with the waters of the atmosphere and on the earth, which afford some foundations for the l^te? conceptions of l*is kingdom.'</page><page sequence="22">J 78 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute 3Tc^èf TTsrac ^nr mïïvm fasr CTÍT ^rsrr miï ^TwrR 1 ( AV. VII. 83.1 ) clearly pointed to the abode of Varuna being among waters. In this connection a reference may also be made to the linguistic connection, proposed by Hopkins, between the words, Varuna, on the one hand, and vari, ť a river ? and vari , ' water, ' on the other. Lüders seems to have modified the ocean-theory by re- garding Varuna as representing originally the ocean surround- ing the world. Apart from the faulty etymology suggested by Hopkins, it must be said regarding this theory, that, according to the Vedic evidence, 4 waters ' or * ocean ' represent only one region of Varuna's supreme sovereignty. It may also be pointed out that in no idg. religion is the ocean glorified as the world-sovereign. Moreover it is positively doubtful whether the sea was at alj regarded by the Vedic Aryans as of such great "importance as to make its god the most august and the most paramount god of the Vedic pantheon. It is consequently quite impossible to accept the theory put forth by Pischel. A critical examination of the Vedic hymns would clearly in- dicate that the mythology dominated by Varuna, Mitra, the Ädityas, and Aditi does not exhibit even the faintest traces of 'naturalism - 9 that is to say, of the worship of the Powers of Nature as Divine Beings. 1 It has already been shown that the Vedic Varuna cannot be said to be primarily representing the sky-god, or the winter-god or the moon-god, or the god of ocean. What then is his essential nature ? Let us approach this problem in a constructive way by clearly analysing the principal concep- tions with which Varuna is associated in a special and exclusive manner. Among all the Vedic gods the title asura seems to belong specially to Varuna. A large number of passages from the Veda would make this fact abundantly clear : ÇTO5TWW S%rTT 1 ( I. 24.14 ) 1 Macnicol ( Indian Theism ) seems to make an overcautious statement in this conneotioQ : 4 As we discern his figure, Varuna seems to be in the act of passing beyond physical limitations to take his place as a moral lord* over the consciences of man.*</page><page sequence="23">Asura Varum 179 fèrrei ^orrfa Trsrr q- =5T 3Tg* q- ^ ïTcTT- ( II. 27.

That word was originally used in the Vedic literature in the sense of a being possessing the highest occult power. Its meaning, namely ' demon', belongs semasiolo- gically to a later date and it was then that the word sura , 'a god' was artificially coined throgh a misunderstanding of the a in asura as a prefix of negation. Philologically the word asura is derived from asu by the addition of the possessive termi- nation-ra. I have shown elsewhere ( Der Vedische Mensch , p. 25), on the basis of philological and anthropological evid enee, that asu must have been originally regarded as a supernatural fluid like the primitive Mana . This fluid invested upon a being some supernatural occult power, which belongs to the realm of the 4 invisible ' and which is quite distinct 1 It is interesting to note that Ghose ( Aryan trail in India and Iran) emphasises upon Varuna's resemblance to Assara Mazãs and his Igigi of the Hommel inscription (left by Assurbanípal, the Assyrian Imperial king) and to Ahura of the Magians. Assur was the local deity of the metropolis of the first kingdom of Assyria. Ghose believes that Assara Mazãs was the original of Ahura Mazdah. * The real link/ hê goes on to say, 4 to connect Varuça with Ahura is not to be found in a common etymological source from which the two names may be supposed to have derived. The name Ahura, if it had any etymological base of any kind at all and was not simply taken from a quite arbitrarily fixed place-name, had without doubt a Semlitio or Elamatic and not an Aryan origin.' The process of borrowing %was thus, according to Ghose, ( quite strangely, indeed !) : Assur ( Semitic) - Ahura ( Iranian ) - Asura ( Vedic ). Macnicol says : * If there was indeed any debt on the part of Varurja or Ahura Mazdah to the Semites, that debt was repaid later : M. Cumont points out that without doubt at the period of the Achaemenides a rapproa- chment took place between the Semitic Baalsamin and the Persian Ahura Mazdah, the ancient deity of the vault of heaven but now become the supreme physical and moral power/</page><page sequence="24">iŠo Ânnaîs of the Bhandarkar Oriental Řesearch Institute from physical strength. The occult power which comes from Mana may be utilised both for good as well as bad purposes. To possess and tö control the largest quantity of that all-penetra- ting magic fluid was the greatest achievement ever thought of. It should be remembered in this connection that the magic fluid postulated by the primitives is not what we may call ' spirit, ' 4 mind ' or 4 soul. ? It is a power-substance which fills the living beings ; but even the lifeless can have it magically filled up in them. The Balak call such power-substance Tondi , while the Huron-Indians call it Orenda. The conception of Orenda , Tondi, Mana is the ultimate solution offered by the primitive to the riddle of life and being. What is true of the Melanesians, Polynesians, Australian tribes, American Indians, African Negroes etc. must also be true of the earliest idg. peoples. The primitive religions assumed the subtle working of Orenda in all the invisibly working abd changing forces of nature, in the organic * becoming ' and ' growing 7 of man, indeed in all per* fectly-regulated cosmic activities. The main function of the primitive religious magic is, on the one hand, to collect and increase, as much as possible, this occult fluid in oneself, and, on the other, to reduce it in others substantially. The as¿¿-conception in the Veda may as well be styled the 4 Vedic orendism. ? The asura accordingly is the being who possesses the highest amount of asu9 the occult power-substance, and therefore commands the greatest occult power. Varuna is asura par excellence. On account of his enormous magic power he creates the universe, regulates it into an orderly whole, and wields the most supreme sovereignty over it. This unique power of the asura is .called mãyã ; Varuna is therefore associated in a special way with the conception of mãyã . Geldner derives the word mãyã from miyate , minãti , or minoti , 1 to lessen/ 4 to hinder', 4 to injure ' This etymology would give that word a more or less negative sense, which however cannot be confirmed by the Vedic evidence. Vedic references indicate that the fundamental conception underlying the word mãyã is that of a secret, mysterious power, possessed by good as well as evil spirits, and the capacity to achieve miracles, which are incom- prehensible from the point of view of normal beings. The regular</page><page sequence="25">Asura Varuna loi working of the enormous natural phenomena is thus regarded as resulting from the maya of Varuna. The word maya has there- fore to be derived from mimati or mimile, which root does not only mean 4 to measure, ' but also 4 to create 9 4 to arrange ' etc. Mãyâ thus represents the capacity to plan or to organise, mainly in the spiritual sense rather than in the technical sense. As Neisser has pointed out, many Vedic passages actually connect the word maya with the root mä : čHETRr 1% mfaÍT ÏTÎÎÎ* I ( HI. 38.7 ) wraiísŘt *rw&gt; SRT WTIT I ( IX. 83.3 ) à rnfaít gròíW 1 ( I. 1 59-4 )• The word is philologically connected with Gk. métis ' clever', Lit. monai ' magic, ' Lett, man' i ' roguery, ' Obg. manili ' deceive, ' Slav. mátoha ' spectre ' ' ghost ' etc. The conceptions underlying the words, asura and mãyã , throw a good deal of light upon the true personality of Varuna. As the creator and the constructor of the universe, Varuna is regarded as the awe-inspiring and miracle-working magician. Many Vedic passages will amply corroborate this assumption : smi g fàrfara ütÉ I STfflR li (I. 24.10 ) 3T%: SI trTS^r PŤ íWt niq-qr i ( V. 63.3 ) H «nrcnr 1%: sntncarr 1 wpr * írtt.. f%ar otto- t%^ U ( VII. 87.4 ). In VII. 86.6, Varuna is directly called yaksin, a magician, while in V. 85.2-6 the whole working of the magic of asura Varuna is picturesquely described. The hymn, VIII. 41, is again dedicated to the glorification of the incomprehensible miracle accompli- shed by Varuna. The sun traversed his path in the high heavens punctually every day ; the changing phases of the moon appear- ed in the sky at night according to a definite plan ; the innumer- 4 [ Annali, B. Û. R. !• ]</page><page sequence="26">i §2 Annals of the Èhandarkar Oriental Research Institute able stars twinkled. The Vedic Aryan saw and marvelled at all these natural phenomena, which appeared to him to be controlled and guided by some invisible hand. He wondered at the shi- ning vault of the heavens; he observed with dismay the regular change of seasons ; he imagined the night to be spreading a gigantic cover over the heavenly dome ; he was indeed dumb- founded by the riddle of the origin and growth of life. He soon realised that there must have been some ' law ' which regulated the workings of nature and the activities of human beings ; but for him that 4 law ' was shrouded in darkness and mystery. He could accordingly put forth the only workable hypothesis in this regard, namely, to consider the creation and the working of the cosmos as the achievement of a tremendously powerful magician. The starting point of this hypothesis was naturally his own ex- perience of the tribal medicineman who, by virtue of the pos- session of the occult fluid, Mana , Orenda , asu , accomplished some magic tricks which remained a veritable mystery to the ordinary man. This popular belief naturally led to the assum- ption, in ancient religion, of a cosmic-magician, who possessed the highest amount of the occult-power asu - who was, in other words, asura par excellence - and could therefore accomplish through his maya the most enormous and the most magnificent miracle of the universe. The two currents of thought underly- ing the words, asura and mãyã, which may be anthropologically traced back to almost every ancient religious belief, make the essential personality of Varuna in the Veda quite clear. Varuna is the great asura , possessing the largest amount of the occult power-substance, asu , and bis maya, resulting from this fact, is the creation of the incomprehensibly majestic miracle of the oosmos. He is the magician-creator of the world as well as its supreme sovereign. This particular characteristic of the essen- tial nature of Varuna is most picturesquely represented in his other aspect, namely the Vedic god, Savifcr ( vide my paper, New Light on the Vedic God , Savitr ). As'Güntert (Der arische Welt - Jcônig ) has pointed out the conception of a sovereign world- magician creating, supervising and controlling the working of the cosmic law is common to many ancient religions. The Australian tribes have postulated, in their religious belief,</page><page sequence="27">As ura Yarwm 183 Bäjami , the Algonkin Indians of North America Atahccan , the Irokes Joskeha , the Tzendals Votan , the No vaho tribes Absonnuth , the North- western races Fč/íZ, to play the same role as Varuna does in the early Vedic religion. It is evidently a gross mistake to try to identify Varuna with some power of nature. How does Varuna control the cosmic law ? The etymology of the name Varuna would considerably enlighten us on this question. Attention has already been drawn to the fact that to derive Varuna from the root vr, 4 to cover 9 is impossible from the philological point of view. Meillet derives the word Varuna from the idg. root *Uer-Ure 4 to speak ' The word vrata is also derived from that root. The possible connection between god Varuna and his commands - vrata - is hereby linguistically suggested. Varuna is accordingly the commander-god. Meillet further connects the word Varuna with Obg. ròta 4 oath ' Gk, rëtor etc. It will however be seen that there is no deriva- tive from * uer-Ure in w-themes, which fact would render the derivation of the word Varuna from it unacceptable. The word Varuna is best derived from - * to bind. 7 Other "derivatives from that root are Lett, weru wert 4 bind down/ Obg. veruga 4 chain, ' Lat. urvum etc. It will thus be seen that there are also «¿-derivatives from that root. It may therefore be definitely concluded, as Petersson has done, that the name Varuna is derived from the idg. *Ueru-n-os 4 the binder. ' This etymology is amply corroborated by Varuna 's pãsa and the whole religious thought dominated by them. The whole cosmic phenomenon is held in bondage by this supreme binder through his pãéa, which produced, so to say, a net of magic. The idea of a magic net woven round the mankind and the world is quite common in the RV : I ( I. l 5 9-4 ) fa; rasrrcrfa sňgn i (¡VI. 9.2 ). Further the following Vedic passages may be considered in this connection '• T. 92.2 ; III. 3.6 ; Vil. 10.2 ; VIII. 43.20 : X. 57.2 ; X. 82.1 ; X. 129.5 ; AV. X. 8.37 ; AV. XIII. 1.6 etc. The words like yãtu, yukti, yoga , ycUar, vayas, vayuna etc. belong to the same ideology. As a logical extension of this idea, Varuna, in his capacity of the world-sovereign, of the upholder of the cosmic</page><page sequence="28">184 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute law, and of the moral governor is represented to be employing his paia to put the sinners against his law into bondage by way of punishment. The two currents of thought indicated above seem to have been blended together into the conception of the paia of Varuna. An analysis of the conception of rta would prove very helpful at this stage. It was Brugmann who started the linguistic in- vestigations in this connection. According to him Gk. eirénë ( or trana ) is the reduplicated derivative from the idg. %r-ť to bind/ ' to unite/ 8 to join together/ The Ok. word eirêriè means ' well-joined together ' holy bond/ 4 clever bringing together/ Some further derivatives from that root, in different directions, are Sk. arah , aram , arpayati , Lat. arma , artus etc. There are still other derivatives from the idg. *ar-, with an additional t in the base, such as Mhd. art , Sk. rta , Arm. ardar ' right ' 'law- ful, 9 Gk. artios etc. These latter words will be seen to possess primarily special ethical significance. The Vedic rta thus re- presents the holy bond - the unbreakable, invulnerable law - which is the foundation of all natural phenomena and which binds them down into a well-ordered whole. The Vedic references to rtasya tantu ( AV. IL 1.5 ; AV. XIII. 3.19 ) would seem to support this explanation of the Vedic r/a-conception. The path of rta is often said to have been spun out by means of threads of light : &lt;T«ir skhw wrèi TRwfa: I ( I. 136.2 ). The Vedic conception of rta thus represents the abstraction of the same idea which is more or less concretely personified through Varuna. The Iranian counterpart of rta will be clearly seen in a$a ? it would be particularly interesting to compare Wham rtasya with asahê xãm ( Y. 10.4 ), rtasãp with ašem...hapti (y.31.32) and vedhâ rtasya with àsavazdah. B. Geiger has shown that asa and druj of the Avesta have been represented through the Vedic rta and drh9 which latter are clearly contrasted with each other ( 1, 122.9 ). Günterfc believes that the conceptions of rta and 4 cosmos ' are semasiologicplly connected with each other since the word cosmos itself can be traced back to a root ( *kent ) mean- ing * to bind together, '</page><page sequence="29">Asura Varuqa 185 It has already been pointed out that an outstanding feature of the Varuna-religion is Varuna's connection with the Ädityas and Aditi. Here too one would find the same conception of * binding 9 underlying ;these two words. The words aditi and ãditya are derived from the idg. - Sk. dã ' to bind ' and are philologically connected with the words like Sk. daman 4 bond- age. ' The whole world may be bound down by the fetters of Varuna, the world-sovereign, but the Ãdityas, who are hia favoured followers, and who represent the different powers of the great asura Varuna, are naturally unbound and free. They are not involved into the net of magic created by the world magician ( 11.27.10; V. 62.3; V. 63.2; VII. 52.1; VIII. 47.6; VIII. 67.18 ). It may be incidentally pointed out that Bloom- field's suggestion that the word ãditya may be connected with the word adi ' beginning,' and that thus the primeval character of those gods may be assumed is philologically unsound. The Ädityas belong to the entourage of asura Varuna; they may, under his behest, bind down others, but are themselves free from bondage. It will thus be seen that Mitra 4 the binder, ' Varuna ' the binder, ' rta ť holy bond,' ť holy law/ Ãdityas ť the unbound ones' and Aditi ' the unboundness 9 belong to one and the same religious conception which forms the fundamental basis of the Varuna-religion in the Veda. Their unique mutual connection often referred to in the Vedic hymns can be very satisfactorily accounted for on the strength of the hypothesis discussed above. The whole circle of Mitra and Varuna seems to have been quite an ancient feature of the Vedic religion, since, in the Boghazköi inscription of 14th century B. C., Varuna and Mitra are invoked not singly like Indra, but * together with their groups'. Incident- ally it may be mentioned, in this connection, that in the Edda of the ancient Islanders, the god is called bond ( binder ), and that the name of the god of the Thrakians is Barz- ales, which word may be philologically connected with the Avestan darezyeiti * bind down. 9 The Thrakians and the Phry- gians also worshipped a goddess named Bendis ' one who binds down.' It is thus particularly interesting from the point of view of the history of the idg. religious thought, to note that the unique religious conception of the * holy bondage 9 and of the ' binder/ seems to have originated in prehistoric times in somç</page><page sequence="30">i86 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute compact locality where the later Germanic, Thrakian and Indo- Iranian tribes must have once lived together. Varuna may therefore be said to be representing the concep- tion of the world-sovereign who is characterised by those distinct features which are implied by the words, asura, rriãyã, rta, mitra, ãâitya, aditi etc. This world-sovereign further possesses all the attributes of an Oriental ruler. 'He is the rajan ( I. 24.7 ), the svaraj, but more* predominantly the samrãj. The attribute of ksatra is specially appropriated to him. He wears a golden mantle and puts on a shining robe ( I. 25.13 ). The spies-apasa/i -of Varuna make his supreme sovereignty complete. His impe- rial ordinances - vratani-are unchallenged and so he is dlirla- vrata. The moral law of humanity with which Varuna is often associated is but a part of his guardianship of the cosmic law. This regal aspect of Varuna's personality may throw some light on the Vedic ideal of kingship. Johansson believes that the con- ception of Kingship is itself personified as a god in Varuna. Some scholars even go to the extent of deriving the word Varuna -from the root vr ' to choose ' and presume on the strength of that evi- dence that the king was, in the Vedic period, chosen or elected ! The essential nature of Varuna is necessarily all-compre- hensive. Varuna's domain is therefore vast and he is often severally represented as being almost identical with other Vedic divinities such as Soma, Yama etc. It must however be remem- bered that Varuna is not identical with any one of these ; he includes and transcends them all. In another paper ( New Light on the Vedic God, Savitr ) I have shown that, through the per- sonality of Savitr, a special aspect of Varuna - Varuna as a magician and Varuna as a commander- has been glorified by the Vedic poets. A comparison between the circle of the Vedic gods, Varuna, Mitra and the Ãdityas on the one hand, and the corresponding circle of the Iranian divinities, Ahura Mazdah, Mithra, and the Amesa Spentas on the other, which however is beyond the scope of this paper, will amply corroborate every detail regarding Varuna's essential character. ' The number of hymns dedicated to Varuna's praise, ' writes Macdonell, ' is not a sufficient criterion to his exalted character. Hardly a dozen hymns celebrate him exclusively. ' In two</page><page sequence="31">Asura Varuna 187 dozen more hymns, however, Varuna is invoked along with his double, Mitra. These hymns, addressed to Miträvarunau as a dual-divinity, present Mitra and Varuna as two gods supplementing each other; sometimes a slight contrast between the two is also implied. A. critical study of the Miträ- varuna - hymns, however, often makes one feel inclined to accept the suggestion of Bohnenberger that Mitra and Varun^ formed originally one single godhead, which was later on split up into two and that even then Mitra was merely used as an attribute of Varuna. On etymological grounds it has been shown that the essential character of both the gods is the same. But there are certain points in this connection which cannot be overlooked. Firstly Mitra alone is celebrated only in one hymn; secondly in the hymns addressed to Miträvarunau, Varuna is more preeminently glorified than his understudy, Mitra ; and thirdly, even inspite of his essential character of a 4 binder, 9 Mitra does not possess any pasa, while Varuna's paia , whicl} serve a double purpose, are often glorified ( I. 24.15 ; I. 25.21 ; VII. 88.7; AV. IV. 16.6ff. ). On the basis of this evidence a plausible hypothesis regarding the distinct domains of Mitra and Varuna may be hazarded. Bondage is of two types - by means of the bonds of friendship and by means of the bonds of slavery. The first type of bondage is usually brought about between equals, while the second type of bondage implies the unchallengeable superiority of the binder. Mitra presides over the bonds of friendship - agreements, contracts and treaties. Varuna produces through his pasa an invisible net of magic, in which the whole creation is held in bondage, and also punishes the sinners against the cosmic and the moral law through his pasa . As Güntert has pointed out, Mitra, as a friendly divinity, helps to bring about friendly bondage bet- ween man and man, and between god and man ( IV. 44.5 ) ; he is particularly the guardian of human laws. Varuna, on the other hand, presides over an all-inclusive domain ; his Law includes all laws. Moreover it is also suggested in the Vedic hymns that one is conscious when one breaks the law of Mitra. Varuna's law works in a very subtle way and there are often unconscious lapses against it ( V. 85.8 ; VII. 89.3 ). It must how- ever be remembered that this distinction between the domain^</page><page sequence="32">1 88 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute of Varana and Mitra is never strongly emphasised in the Veda. Indeed Mitra falls into the background and may be regarded merely as one of the Ädityas. Varuna dominates this particular aspect of the Vedic religion and Mitra is reduced to the position of his understudy. The later Vedic ritualistic literature deve- loped the originally slight distinction between the two gods in quite a different direction, which fact gave rise to a lot a mis- understanding regarding their primary character. The original conceptions represented by Varuna and Mitra had no place in the scheme of the Vedic ritual and consequently their essential personalities were greatly distorted so as to suit the ritualistic purpose. The rivalry between Indra and Varuna forms an outstanding feature of the Vedic mythology. The most typical instance, in this connection, is the RV-hymn, IV. 42, which includes a ť War- talk between the two Gods. ' The Vedic religious thought shows three very marked phases • (1) The 1 naturalism 9 pure and simple, when the Vedic thinker was struck by the vastness, brightness and profuseness of nature and therefore glorified several powers of nature as divine beings. ( 2 ) Later on however he realised that this vast existence was not chaos but that it was cosmos ; there was some law which regulated and controlled all phenomena of nature, and there was a sovereign-lord who enforced the proper conduct of that law. This stage is represented by the Varuna - rta - conception. (3) This ethical abstraction in religion could not for long satisfy the fighting and conquering Aryan tribes. The nature of a god is conditioned by the life of a people. The fighting Aryans created a warrior-god, Indra, who, for that time, sur- passed all other gods. The Vedic hymn, IV. 42, is a characteristic document of a revolution in the order of rank among gods, which seems to have taken place during the Vedic period $ it indicates the super- session of Varuna, who stood at the height of divine glory in the Aryan period, through Indra, the national war-god of the Vedic Indians. The old religious order made place for the new one,</page><page sequence="33">Asura Var upa 189 on account of the changing circumstances of the Vedic people. This assumption might explain why Varuna's counterpart in the Avesta, Ahura Mazdah, was still glorified by the Iranians ; there was no original counterpart cf Indra to rival him in that religion. In the Vedic period also there was a group of Yedic Aryans, particularly the Vãsisthas, who preserved and considerably glorified the ancient Varuna-religion. Serious attempts seem to have been generally made at the same time to bring about a compromise between the Varuna-religion and the Indra-religiòn, whioh fact is indicated by the Vedic passages such as, T%sra; 5TrTT?W. I . Indra ť conquers ' but it is Varuna who 4 rules. 9 Thus there are to be seen, in the Vedic hymns, three distinct phases of the relation between Varuna and Indra, namely, Varuna's unchall- enged superiority to all gods, a compromise between the func- tions of Varuna and Indra, and finally Varuna' s supersession through Indra. All the same the spirit of rivalry between asura Varuna and Indra characterises a large part of the Vedic liter- ature and ritual. The difference in the essential natures of these two gods is reflected, as Bergaigne has pointed out, in the very prayers addressed to them. Indra is the ideal of a fighting and conquering people ; as his very name would indicate he is the symbol of manly vigour and physical strength ; he is often represented in the Veda as an inveterate divine bully, ever in- dulging in drinking and fighting. He possesses all the virtues and also the weaknesses of a manly hero. Varuna, on the other hand, is represented as the highly spiritualised and idealised protector of law. In contrast to Varuna, Indra, as the national war-god, was celebrated in a very large number of myths. It is likely that the rivalry, in the Vedic religion, between the Aryan war-god, Indra, and the asura was accentuated through the historical rivalry between the Aryans and the Assyrians, there being perhaps created in the minds of the people a confus- ion between the names, asura and Assyrians, as the result of the linguistic phenomenon of folk-etymology. If this hypothesis were to be correct it may throw some light upon the question of 5 [ Annals, B. O. R. I. ]</page><page sequence="34">lyö Annaìs of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute the relation between the Yedic civilisation and Indus-valley civilisation. 1 The rivalry between Indra and Varuna would give us the necessary starting point for the discussion of how the world- sovereign Varuna of the RV was transformed into the god of ocean in the classical Hindu mythology. The deterioration in Varuna' s religious supremacy began with the ascendancy of Indra. But the central conception represented by Varuna deve- loped in quite a different direction. In India metaphysical thought evolved out of mythological imagery. As Deussen has pointed out the later Indian metaphysical speculations were founded on the older religious conceptions. In the mystic Upanisadic doctrine of brahman , a critical observer would find the metaphysical development of the Varuna-religion in the Veda. The teaching of mukti-moksa may also be traced back to the conception of the pãéa of Varuna. The spiritual side of Varuna 's personality - or, in other words, the essential nature of Varuna - was thus preserved and philosophically modified. What remained of his divine sovereignty, after Indra's rise, was divided among several gods. An independent god was created to preside over every region, over which Varuna is represented, in the Veda, to be ruling. There remained only the ocean, which came into prominence in later times. The imperial ruler was reduced to the position of a provincial governor ; Varuna be- came the god of ocean. Varuna 's special connections with waters described in the Veda ( II. 28.4 ; II. 38.8 ; V. 85.3 ; V. 85.6 ; VII. 87.1 ; VIII. 41.2 ; X.75.2 5 AV. VII. 83,1 ), the con- ceptions of the 4 upper 9 ocean and the 'lower' ocean in the Vedic cosmography, and the usual tendency to regard ocean as the re- pository of all mysteries, must have facilitated this transition l A hypothesis may be hazarded in this connection. Indra is often called pur andar a ( the breaker of cities ) in the Veda. The Indus Valley civilisation as represented at Mohenjodaro and Harappa is primarily "cha- racterised by what may be called city-culture. Can it be that the nomadic Aryans under the leadership of purandara Indra destroyed that culture ? Indra was also later on regarded as an enemy and the greatest conqueror of asuras ( the original basis of this conception being the rivalry in the Vedic religion between asura Varuna and Indra ). Is it therefore further possible that the Indus civilisation was Assyrian civilisation? Does the evidenoe of seals discovered in the Indus valley and Central Asia support the above assumption ?</page><page sequence="35">Asura Varuna 191 to a certain extent. 1 It is very likely, as Kretschmer has in- dicated, that a linguistic phenomenon also influenced this transi- tion. In one Boghazköi inscription the name of Varuna is mentioned as a-ru-na-as-si-eL This may have been confused later on with aruna , which word means * sea 9 in the Hittite lan- guage. Thé Hittite word, aruna , is linguistically connected with Sk. arria* arcava. The process of the transformation in the personality of Varuna may thus have started, perhaps indepen- dently, in Central Asia. 1 Both says in this connection : 'When, on the one hand, the conception of Varurta as the all-embracing heaven had been established, and, on the other hand, the observation of the rivers flowing towards the ends of the earth and to the sea had led to the conjecture that there existed an ocean enclosing the earth in it3 bosom, then the way was thoroughly prepared for connecting Varuna with the ocean/ Whatever the forces which may have dethroned Varuna from his high ethical eminence to be a mere ruler of the storms and tides, the dethrone- ment was, according to Macnicol, ' an event in the spiritual history of India that was at once a symptom and a determinant of the long, succeeding process of its development. The " Hebraic flavour " that was in Varuça was then definitely declared to be foreign to the Indian spirit, and since that day its indications have been rare.'</page></plain_text>
