In this collection of seven essays, preparatory to a commentary, Betz presents us with an important and suggestive hypothesis about the Sermon on the Mount (SM). He proposes that it is a unified work of a pre-Matthaean redactor, one with its own distinctive theology, which is to be understood as being not only different from other forms of early Christianity but also explic- itly opposed to at least one of them. The community from which it comes is engaged in self-definition over against, and consequently in opposition to, non-Christian Judaism, especially Pharisaism, "nascent Gentile Christianity," and, more obliquely, the philosophical traditions of the gentile world. The source, of course, has its own positive theology: how to be found righteous at the final judgment. "The eschatology of the SM consists in the hope that Jesus will appear as advocate for his faithful followers, that is, for those who have done the will of his Father in heaven, in accordance with his teaching, in the last judgment" (p. 152). This comment is made in the discus- sion of the concluding pericopes, especially 7.21-23. Betz also, very percep- tively, points out that the macarisms in 5.4-9 correspond "to individual scenes in which the fate of the righteous in paradise is described" (p. 24). The worldview of the SM is entirely within the bounds of PalestinianJudaism in the middle of the first century (p. 91). And its christology does not take on any of the distinctive Christian coloration known from other literature: Jesus is seen as a teacher "and nothing more." The SM confronts the charge that Jesus was a heretical teacher, and it claims for him strict orthodoxy (pp. 42-43). It is only those who obey him who will fare well at the last judgment, and the issue is only right practice, based on right teaching, which the SM itself offers. "The SM lacks not only a Christology, but the soteriology based upon it as well. The soteriology of the SM is none other than that of the Jewish Torah" (p. 92). Betz continues by speaking of the elimination "of the death and resurrection of Jesus... as the basis for soteriology" (p. 93). The soteriology of the SM differs at one point from standard Jewish views: "The official cult is nowhere mentioned and is therefore rejected as inessential" (p. 68). These arguments from silence are based on the view that the SM was intended to be an epitome of the teaching of Jesus and that, therefore, things not included were explicitly rejected (see pp. 38-39). I find in these essays much to agree with. For example, I think it worthwhile to try to find presynoptic sources, and Betz's willingness to seek one, without being handcuffed by Q and M, is refreshing. He does not deny the existence of Q and in some ways simply sidesteps the question. He proposes that possibly Q existed in different versions (p. 18), and he says about the relation of Matt. 6.1-18 to Q only that "it is another matter" (p. 56). In discussing 6.25-34 he proposes that the redactor of the SM "derived his material from the Q-tradition, but not the composition as it now appears" (p. 103). I think, in fact, that Betz's Permission to reprint a book review printed in this section may be obtained only from the author. 87</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion work, if upheld, would mean that Q could be no more than a vague source of "floating" material, existing in different versions, and essentially undefinable. That strikes me as entirely acceptable, but those who discuss "the Qcommunity" will wait for Betz's commentary to see if he there sorts out what his view means for Q. It will also be important for him to consider what else might be identified as coming from the same circle as the SM. He notes the close relation of the SM to 10.1-42 (p. 142); but, in dealing with the attack on "the hypocrites" in 6.1-18, he does not investigate the close relation with chapter 23, and he attributes 23.2 to Jesus. But the numerous points of close agreement between the SM and chapter 23 require careful consideration. Betz says that the SM was not largely composed by Matthew, but he does not actually argue the case. He says that Matthaean authorship is impossible on the basis of philology and theology (p. 18), and he refers to his chapter 4 as proving it; but the proof is not actually forthcoming, and we simply read that "we may be certain that Matthew did not compose the section himself" (p. 62). At no point does Betz refer to the work of Michael Goulder, whose detailed studies of philology and habits of composition need to be faced before we can say with confidence that Matthew was not the author. I turn now to the groups that Betz sees as being opposed. His argument that gentile Christianity is under attack seems basically correct: it could be, of course, that Jewish Christians who were not entirely strict in keeping the law and the higher righteousness are the targets. But the polemical edge, especially of the concluding pericopes and 5.17-20, cannot be missed. Betz attempts to be more specific: he sees "least" in 5.19 as being a veiled reference to Paul since paulus in Latin means "little." He contrasts this with building on the rock, ten petran, in 7.24. At first I regarded this as too fanciful. But early Christian groups did line up on the side of one apostle or the other, and I do not think that these veiled references can be simply dismissed. The proposal that much of the SM is directed against the Greek worldview rests on the assumption that its author knew as much about it as does Betz. He takes the saying in 6.23b, "if the light within you is dark," to be "flatly directed against the Greek philosophical tradition," which regarded the inner light as divine (p. 86). But did the author of the saying actually have that tradition in mind? Is it really true that "two sayings of Heraclitus are important for the study of Matt. 6.22-23" (p. 76) and that the verses are intended to disagree with Empedocles (p. 78)? It is marvelous to read Betz's explorations in Greek philosophical literature. So few New Testament scholars today are capable of it that Betz's ability must be saluted. But sometimes, I suspect, he presses beyond the bounds of the probable in seeking parallels. I find much more con- vincing his several discussions of views "common to antiquity" (e.g., p. 111). Betz does not show similar erudition in discussing Pharisaism, which becomes a major topic when he turns to "righteousness" in Matt. 5.17-20. He would have been greatly aided by Benno Przybylski's study, Righteousness in Matthew and His World of Thought (Cambridge, 1980). Since the SM explicitly names "scribes and Pharisees" as having inadequate "righteousness" (5.20) and since they are probably meant to be included in the denunciations of 6.2 and 6.5, the study would have profited had Betz done some research into the Pharisaic understanding of righteousness instead of relying on the cliches of Christian scholarship of decades ago. Thus he writes that "what mattered according to Pharisaic theology was the fulfillment of the commands of the 88</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Torah which, because of their difficulty, were judged to be more 'important'" (p. 49). And he says that the SM, against the Pharisees, requires "a renuncia- tion of merely external observance," that Pharisaic "praxis was not capable of producing that 'qualitative surplus' which is alone acceptable to God," and that righteousness "cannot simply be produced by the external observance of regu- lations, as practiced by the scribes and Pharisees" (p. 53). What is wrong here is that he seems to take it to be a fact that Pharisaism was merely external and not capable of producing the higher righteousness. Thus he misses the chance of explaining the nature of the polemic that, like most religious polemics, focuses on motives: attributing to the enemies bad motives, hypocrisy, and the like. This leads, in turn, to missing a major issue. If we doubted the accuracy of the polemic, if we supposed that the Christian group represented here did not break with Pharisaism because all Pharisees were hypocrites, we would have to ask what led to the split. Betz has denied that it was christology or soteriology. As always, accepting the view that Judaism, especially Pharisaism, had become a debased religion means that one does not look hard to see what really was at issue in the debate. The chapter concludes simply by saying that "the commands of Jesus in the SM cannot simply be regarded as legal provisions, subject to outward fulfillment" (p. 53). This is a facile and unpersuasive distinction from Pharisaism. Many of the commandments in the SM, for one thing, require outer fulfillment (anointing one's head, fasting, and the like). And the Pharisees urged themselves to concentrate on inner commitment and intention. Betz seems simply to have bought the polemic of the SM as repre- senting the actual difference between this wing of the church and the Pharisees. My guess is that finding the actual point of departure would mean reintro- ducing a bit of christology. Even granting that the SM is an enclosed docu- ment and that it intended to present a comprehensive epitome of the teaching of Jesus, there is no reason to think that it therefore contains every idea important to its community. Why would an epitome ofJesus' teaching need to include discussion of his atoning death? That christological topic would not fit the genre and would be left out for that reason, rather than because it was not believed in. We have here a stimulating and helpful work, studies on the way to a major commentary. I think that some of the points have not yet been fully thought out, but it is clear that Betz is engaged in an important and fruitful study. E. P. SANDERS, Oxford University. FRETHEIM, TERENCE E. The Suffering of God: An Old Testament Perspective. Edited by WALTER BRUEGGEMAN. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984. 203 pp. $10.95 (paper). Classically, the idea of a suffering God was abhorrent, fit only for heretics and writers of devotional hymns and prayers. Now, voices theological, exegetical, and sociological vie for pride of place in subverting classical understandings in favor of a vision in which divine passibility is central.
