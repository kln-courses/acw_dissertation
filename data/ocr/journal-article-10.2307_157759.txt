<plain_text><page sequence="1">220 Reviews 'Peripheral Realism', which is based on a 'citizen-centric' foundation. This 'Peripheral Realism' takes foreign policy making as the primary locus of theoretical investigation and argues that, for peripheral (the term is Escude's) states, the primary goal of policy must be economic development for the benefit of citizens, not elites. The approach is Realist because it advocates self-interested behaviour to achieve these ends. Peripheral states should avoid unnecessary conflict with great powers and abstain from both interstate power politics and 'costly idealistic interstate policies' (p. 88). The approach is deeply critical of Realist theories and theorists such as Kenneth Waltz, Hedley Bull, Robert Gilpin and Stephen Krasner, who, Escude argues, are guilty of over-simplification, naivete, logical inconsistency, empirical errors and ideological bias (as is all international relations theory according to Escude). Another criticism of Realism is the excessive anthropomorphism in relation to the state. The book utilises empirical material from the practice of Argentine foreign policy to assert that where Argentine foreign policy-makers follow the dictates of orthodox Realism, the policies pursued are disastrous for Argentine citizens (as under Alfonsin) but where Peripheral Realism is pursued (as under Menem) the results are somewhat happier. The most interesting of the criticisms of Political Realism is that which highlights the tendency to treat states as akin to a human individual and, at the same time, to ignore the costs to real individuals of foreign policies that result in war or conflicts with other states. Escude's remaining criticisms are not new and have been articulated with more sophistication elsewhere. One of the problems with this book is that its author is culpable of the very failures of which he accuses the Political Realists, particularly in the form of over-simplification of the theories and authors he chooses to pillory. Generalisations way beyond the scope of the data are presented and in a tone that verges on personal abuse as opposed to careful evaluation. Hedley Bull, for example, displays a 'condescending sympathy' towards issues of justice which 'is consistent with his ideological drive to upholster the state system' (p. 73). The author's argument rests on the premise that foreign policy makers who put Realist theories into practice cause damage to the interests of their citizens. To make this argument the author must insist that foreign policy makers in peripheral countries actively read and utilise Realist authors as guides to policy. Such an interpretation is at best highly improbable and at worst demonstrates a basic error in terms of conflating Realist theory (explanations of policy) with the political practice of statesmen and women (the policy itself). University of Kent HAZEL SMITH Fabrice Lehoucq, Lucha electoraly sistema politica en Costa Rica, 1948-1998 (San Jose, Costa Rica: Editorial Porvenir S.A., i997), pp. 77, pb. Fabrice Lehoucq intended to write an introduction to contemporary Costa Rican political institutions and, predictably, the result was a basic book though not an uninteresting one. In eight chapters Lehoucq charts the features of the I949 Constitution, their relationship with the country's political crisis in the 194os, and their role in promoting both remarkable political stability and a chronic fiscal</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 221 crisis. The chapters include profiles of the electoral system, the dynamics of the party system, the role of the judiciary and, crucially, executive-legislative relations, arguably the most intractable issue in presidential regimes. The book's main merit is in showing, with the help of recent neo- institutionalist literature, that purely institutional factors are crucial in understanding Costa Rica's successful political development in the last 5o years. Lehoucq's thesis is that Costa Rica has managed to resolve the executive vs. legislative conundrum by means of a clever institutional design. This design includes an electoral system conducive to the existence of two large and disciplined parties- by means of closed lists, concurring presidential and legislative elections and vertical candidate-selection processes in the parties - and a comparatively weak presidency, which can nevertheless secure legislative allegiance through the dispensation of limited forms of patronage. The existence since 1949 of an electoral authority fully independent from the executive has been equally important, since it has removed the main cause of political instability in pre-i948 Costa Rica. This analysis of Costa Rica's recent political evolution is a welcome qualification of the traditional mantras of an egalitarian colonial past and widespread civic traditions that have been used to account for the country's political exceptionality. Lehoucq reminds us of how different institutions, particularly the powerful presidency of the I87I Constitution, failed to guarantee political stability and finally culminated in the 1948 Civil War. In this sense, Lehoucq's book makes useful reading for would-be political reformers. The book is weaker in establishing a link between political institutions and the fiscal crisis of the Costa Rican state. Lehoucq attempts to find such a link through the explosion, since I949, in the number of decentralised public agencies, which are under the political control of the executive and outside the legislature's budgetary oversight. But he never offers an explanation as to why such an explosion happened, other than suggesting that the i949 Constitution made it possible. Such analysis would have been more complex than the book's objectives allowed, involving ideological trends in the 195o-8os, structural features of the relationship between the state and social classes, etc. The origin of the fiscal crisis thus remains a side dish in the book, and the attempt to turn political analysis into Political Economy fails. Other shortcomings include a tendency to intersperse between the analysis a catalogue of recent political anecdotes that add little to the clarity of the exposition or its historical perspective, as well as casual editing which leaves sources of quoted information largely absent. Overall, in spite of its limitations, this book is a valuable addition to the scant bibliography on contemporary Costa Rican politics.
