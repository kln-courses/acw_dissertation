(Reports of the Fifth Thule Expedition, volume 5. 1, Descriptive Part, 327 pp., 85 plates, 135 figs.; 2, The Thule Culture and its Position within the Eskimo Culture, 208 pp., 12 figs. Copenhagen: Gyldendalske Boghandel, Nordisk Forlag, 1927.) Very few expeditions of recent times have yielded such a wealth of high-grade anthropological information as that resulting from the Fifth Thule Expedition of 1921-23. To the Danish scientists, Knud Rasmussen and his colleagues Kaj Birket- Smith and Therkel Mathiassen, the scientific world is indebted for a wealth of con- crete evidence bearing on the fascinating and as yet unsolved problem of the Eskimo. The present study is outstanding in the field of circumpolar archaeology both as regards the extent of the work accomplished and in its exceptionally lucid pre- sentation. Fact and interpretation are largely separated in the two volumes, the first and larger discussing the actual expedition findings and their relationship to all other known sites in the eastern Arctic, while the second volume discusses the place of the main widespread culture thus determined. The focal points of Mathiassen's own investigation are around Repulse bay, just south of the Melville peninsula and north of Chesterfield inlet; Pond inlet on the northern end of Baffin island; and Southampton island to the west of Hudson strait. The key site of Repulse bay is Naujan, an ancient village of 20 winter houses now 100 meters from the sea and from 12 to 20 meters above it. A position so far re- moved from the sea seems to the author to be unusual for maritime Eskimo, and he argues that the land has risen from 8 to 13 meters since the period of occupation, thus assigning a considerable antiquity, perhaps a thousand years, to the site in question. The culture revealed in house ruins and middens, while old, is exception- ally rich and was apparently based on whale hunting. It is a highly developed cul- ture, superior in many ways to that of the present Aivilik Eskimo. The ancient and the present day peoples, while sharing many traits, were nevertheless quite different. The Aivilik, for example, at present lack the permanent winter house and pottery, as well as some twenty types of hunting and working implements common to the older inhabitants. In addition, the Aivilik today have at least nineteen unique features not reported from the old sites. Hence a cultural difference is indicated between present and past populations. Since this older culture had heretofore been reported only from Comner's midden near the station of Thule in North Star bay, North Greenland, Mathiassen designates it as the Thule culture. Similar conditions to those encountered at Naujan are reported from the station of Aivilik, and elsewhere in the vicinity, and here again the modern, loosely constructed, stone tent rings are found near the present shore line, while the old winter houses, solidly constructed stone tent rings and beehive tower traps are found well back from the present beach. At Pond inlet the Thule culture was again encountered in two sites, and again local topography leads the author to conclude that there has been a rise of several meters in the land since the old occupation. The culture here appears to be in a later phase than at Naujan and the presence of what appears to be a fragment of cast</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 145 metal in one of the kitchen middens may indicate white contact. A minimum age of 300 years is suggested for these remains. At Button point on Bylot island a different cultural type, marked by small, gouged-out harpoons and unique types of flint work and decorative carving, was encountered. This is obviously a phase of the Cape Dorset culture of Jenness. Mathiassen is of the opinion, on what seems to the reviewer rather slender evidence, that this material is younger than the Thule culture proper. Nor does his later opinion (2:165) that the Cape Dorset culture is merely "a peculiar, very locally stamped phase of the Thule culture" seem to the reviewer to be entirely justified. The Cape Dorset culture is as yet very poorly defined but it does seem quite differ- ent from the majority of Mathiassen's Thule findings. Other highly patinated arti- facts evidently pertaining to the Cape Dorset culture were brought in by Eskimo from the north end of Southampton island, but here, too, adequate data on prove- nience were unobtainable. Ruins of varying ages were excavated on Southampton island. The oldest from their location suggest a rise of the land from 5-6 meters since their occupation. The earliest houses show a Thule culture comparable to Naujan, while the latest ap- proach very closely in cultural content to the recently extinct Sadlermiut. Especially valuable is the author's condensed account of Sadlermiut material culture obtained from Aivilik Eskimo that had lived with the former group prior to their extinction (through disease) in 1902-3. The author regards the Sadlermiut as modern repre- sentatives of the Thule culture surviving in isolation to recent times. In their perma- nent winter house, whale hunting, and various other traits, they resemble the Thule culture and depart from that of other modern Central Eskimo groups. Particularly interesting is the statement that the Sadlermiut lacked any taboo on mixing pro- ducts of the land and sea. A discussion of various collections from the west coast of Labrador; of the Co- penhagen Museum collection from Comer's midden; and the very old Malerualik collection excavated on King William island by Rasmussen, still further extend the range of the Thule culture in its various manifestations. Part 2 is primarily concerned with the place of the Thule culture in space and time so far as this may be determined by comparison solely with known Eskimo cul- tures. After briefly listing the cultural characteristics and geographic range of the Thule culture, the author enters into a detailed classification and comparison of all its artifact types. This is exceptionally valuable, since it draws on a very extensive knowledge of both Eskimo literature and collections. However, only certain inter- esting details may be mentioned here. The thin harpoon points with open sockets so characteristic of the oldest Thule sites are demonstrated to be a widespread Eskimo form. Since harpoon heads of this type from the oldest sites excavated have rem- nants of sockets for side blades, Mathiassen believes they are derived from older side-bladed, types known only from Alaska. This ultimate derivation from Alaskan or Siberian prototypes is also indicated for a large number of Thule artifacts. The screw is unknown from the Thule culture, a fact which leads the author to</page><page sequence="3">146 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 34, 1932 agree with those who doubt that the screw was truly an Eskimo invention. In re- gard to the winged needle case of the central regions, Mathiassen is inclined to derive the type from the anthropomorphic needle case of Alaska. This view has been criticized by Collins (SI-MC 81:32-33), who supports the earlier opinion of Boas that the flanged, tubular needle case of the Norton Sound region in Alaska and the winged needle case of the eastern Eskimo had a common origin, with the zoomor- phic details as secondary adaptations. The realistic etching and line ornamentation of the Thule culture are certainly related to the art of Alaska, but in the light of our increasing knowledge of Alaskan cultures would appear to be considerably later in the west than Mathiassen believed. It is exceedingly strange that the circle and dot design is not known at all in the Thule culture, for it occurs in all Alaskan Eskimo cultures, in Greenland, and among the Central Eskimo. The discovery of small amounts of pottery in the oldest Thule sites at Naujan and on King William island is significant, as it extends the range of Eskimo ceramics from Coronation gulf to the west coast of Hudson bay. A comparison of pottery types and steatite vessels leads the author to conclude that the rounded soapstone vessels of the Thule culture developed from pottery prototypes in the west. In re- gard to Eskimo use of metals, it is significant that both copper and iron (the latter presumably meteoric) occur in small amounts in Thule culture sites. In his discussion of the whalebone house the author is inclined to regard the round shape of the Thule structure as resulting trom the nature of the material used. He thus equates the square wooden houses of the Point Barrow district and the pear-shaped house of North Greenland with the round Thule culture structure, and explains the differences as due mainly to the materials available. The circular whalebone house is said to have occurred in eastern Siberia, but it seems to the re- viewer that the arguments for its occurrence there, as well as at Kotzebue sound, are vitiated by the fact that in most cases only unexcavated ruins have been observed. Obviously even a square semisubterranean house when long abandoned leaves a round pit. Mathiassen's conclusion, however, that the whalebone house itself ori- ginally came from the rich whaling districts around Bering sea seems logical. The same may be said for his belief that the skin-covered autumn house of stones, and perhaps the skin lining in snow houses employed by the Central Eskimo, represent survivals from the old Thule type of winter house. Much careful excavation must yet be accomplished in many parts of the Eskimo territory before this vexed prob- lem of house types becomes entirely clear. The close relationship between the Thule culture and the culture of the west is indicated by the following citation: Of the elements in the Thule culture that are not common to all Eskimos, i.e., 95, 71 are com- mon to the Thule culture and the western region, 58 are common to the Thule culture and Greenland and only 16 are common to the Thule culture and the present-day Central Eskimos (p. 161). Mathiassen's careful analysis leads, therefore, to the following conclusions:</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 147 We have seen how in all parts of the central region the old Thule culture is found below the modern culture and that these two in certain respects are in contrast to each other; in the central regions proper, west of Hudson Bay, the Thule culture has been entirely swept away; a little more has remained in Baffin Land and Labrador. In the Cape York district in North Greenland we find the pure Thule culture at the bottom and its present inhabitants have re- tained much of the old culture, even if they have been exposed to the influence of the Central Eskimos. In Northeast Greenland we find a later offshoot of the Thule culture, whilst we have no proof that it extended down to Angmagsalik. In northern West Greenland we recognize in scattered finds most of the types of the Thule culture, even if it is not yet represented by any collective find. But otherwise the culture development both here and in South Greenland and Angmagsalik has followed its own line, although the last place doubtless with some influence from the west. In the western regions we see in all the archaeological finds great similarity to the Thule culture and, in addition, signs that a typical Thule culture would appear at the bottom if a search were made for it, something which for the present we only have from East Siberia. The Western Eskimos, however, have received a great part of their elements from the Thule culture, and an Eskimo group like the Point Barrow Eskimos is in reality very closely related to the Thule culture (pp. 180-181). In the light of the more recent work of Jenness and Collins in the Bering sea region, one may justly doubt that a Thule culture is basic to all other Eskimo re- mains in the west. Nevertheless Mathiassen has clearly demonstrated the western origin of the Thule culture itself. As to the age of the Thule culture in the central regions, the reviewer confesses to some qualms in accepting all of the author's time estimates, which of course are frankly tentative. More detailed work, especially of a geological nature, will be necessary to confirm or refute them. The present report emphasizes the description of specimens, occasionally at the expense of detailed top- ographic description, and it is hard to form an independent judgment on such debat- able matters as the location of villages in regard to continental or local uplifts. As the author states, Eskimo archaeology is in its infancy and later work alone can add to or revise the outline so well presented in the present work. A brief analysis of the Tunit legends leads the author to regard those from the central regions as having an historical background connected with the disappear- ance of the Thule culture from that area. On the other hand, the much altered Greenland versions appear as the same tales transplanted to a foreign soil. This brief diversion into the field of intellectual culture is unique; elsewhere the author restricts himself definitely to archaeological or material data. Regarding the route by which the Eskimo entered Greenland, the present author favors that along the south and east coasts of Ellesmere island. He does not deny the possibility of Steens- by's "musk ox route," but points out its impracticability to an essentially maritime culture such as that represented in the Thule findings. In conclusion, Mathiassen emphasizes the specialization of the Thule culture and its western origin, and points out that it can in no sense be regarded as a truly primitive Eskimo horizon. Its theoretical value lies in verifying the formerly hypo- thetical Neo-Eskimo culture of Steensby and objectively demonstrating an earlier coastal culture (Thule) and a later, originally inland, culture (Central Eskimo) on the coasts of the central Arctic. In the present publication Mathiassen holds in</page><page sequence="5">148 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 34, 1932 abeyance any judgment on the possibility of the inland culture (today represented by the Caribou Eskimo) being older than the Thule horizon. This is the view of his colleague Birket-Smith who regards the Caribou Eskimo as the last remnants of a very early Proto-Eskimo population who were originally an inland caribou-hunting people. Mathiassen points out that as yet there is no archaeological proof of the antiquity of this simple inland culture. Lacking this evidence, he believes, it is equally possible to regard these inland hunting groups as stragglers from the Thule culture lured inland by the caribou herds and revising and simplifying their culture on the barren grounds. The Thule culture would, according to this view, be the ear- liest Eskimo culture in the eastern Arctic and its roots would presumably have to be determined by excavations in the west. Kroeber in a very brief review (AA 32:690) of Birket-Smith's monograph on the Caribou Eskimo favors the last interpretation suggested by Mathiassen. The pre- sent reviewer on the other hand inclines toward the interpretation of Birket-Smith, but agrees that in our present state of knowledge the unqualified acceptance of either is largely a matter of opinion. Beyond all matter of opinion is the fact that we are here presented with a wealth of detailed material bearing on the development of Eskimo culture. Working under such difficulties as only those who have attempt- ed excavation work in the Arctic can appreciate, the author has accomplished a gigantic undertaking and he has fulfilled the task of publication equally well. Cer- tain details and interpretations may have to be revised in the light of subsequent work, but the present monograph in its essentials bids fair to be basic in all future consideration of the Eskimo.
