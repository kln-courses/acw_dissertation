<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTENSITY OF ATTITUDE AS A DETERMINANT OF DECISION TIME By LEO POSTMAN, Harvard University, and CHARLOTTE ZIMMERMAN, Radcliffe College Decision-time is a parameter of all judgments. Whenever O is confronted with a number of alternatives, e.g. in making psycho- physical judgments or affective choices, it will take him a measurable amount of time to arrive at a decision. There is a great deal of experimental evidence to show that length of decision-time is syste- matically related to the difficulty of the choice with which O is con- fronted, the correctness of his choice, the categories of response which O is allowed to use, and the affective value-distances between the stimuli judged. The experimental work on the relationship between decision-time and other parameters of judgment may be interpreted as supporting the following generalizations: (1) the greater the diffi- culty of the choice, i.e., the more similar the alternatives between which O has to distinguish, the longer the decision-time;1 (2) correct judgments require shorter decision-times than incorrect judgments;2 (3) there is an inverse relationship between O's confidence and his decision-time;3 (4) the greater the number of categories, the longer will the average decision-time tend to be;4 (5) decision-time varies inversely with the affective separation of the stimuli between which O has to choose.5 * Accepted for publication August 2, 1945. 1 W.

A principle of judgment becomes general when its operation is independent of the particular stimulus-materials used and when its various manifestations can be explained by a comprehensive theory. The principles of decision-time listed above satisfy both these criteria: (1) the laws governing decision-time as a function of the other parameters of judgment have been demonstrated with a great many stimulus-materials and under varying experimental conditions; (2) an attempt has been made by Cartwright6 to give unity to the empirical findings by a general theory of decision-time. Cartwright regards length of decision-time as the resultant of the relative strength of the alternatives with which the individual is confronted when he makes a choice. The more the relative strength of the alternatives approaches equality, the longer the decision-time. On the basis of his theoretical analysis Cartwright predicted that decision-time should be longest at the border of two ranges of equivalent stimuli, i.e., decision-time should be maximal for stimuli yielding a relative frequency of 50 percent. He was able to verify this prediction experimentally and also interpreted most previous experi- mental findings as supporting evidence for his theory. Later, Cartwright and Festinger7 attempted a more rigorous quanti- fication of the theory. Making a considerable number of sweeping mathematical assumptions (e.g., as to distribution and variance) concerning the nature of the 'forces' impinging on the O, they derived theoretical curves of relative frequency of response and of decision- time. To these curves empirical data were fitted with varying success. Cartwright's work is important for its insistence on a general theory of decision-time although his topological representation and vector analysis are questionable in view of the serious criticism of the use of mathematical and physical concepts by Lewin and his students.8 E D.

The purpose of the present investigation is to add further evidence for the generality of some of the principles of decision-time by showing their validity with material of greater complexity than sensory or hedonic stimuli, viz., attitude statements. We are here following the lead of Cartwright, who presented some exploratory data suggesting the "applicability of the general methods of the pre- vious experiments to the study of political attitudes."' The hypothesis to be tested, derived from Cartwright's general theory, is that the time needed by an O to decide on acceptance or rejection of an attitude statement will vary inversely with the intensity of his acceptance or rejection. Since decision-time has been shown to be longest at the border of two ranges of equivalent stimuli, decision-time should be longest for statements toward which the O is relatively indifferent, i.e., which he would be equally willing to accept and reject. PROCEDURE The Os were 28 undergraduate and graduate students at Harvard University, Radcliffe College and the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology. There were 19 women and 9 men. The attitude statements used in the experiment were chosen with two primary considerations in mind: (1) a wide range along an attitude continuum from extreme favorableness to extreme unfavor- ableness had to be covered; (2) the statements had to be sufficiently controversial and varied to evoke responses ranging from unqualified acceptance to complete rejection in the part of the Os. A Thurston- type scale of attitudes toward the Catholic Church was believed to satisfy both these requirements. Twenty statements were selected from mathematical and physical concepts by Lewin in his topological system of psy- chology. For a searching criticism of Lewin's mathematics, cf. I. D. London, Psy- chologists' misuse of the auxiliary concepts of physics and mathematics, ibid., 51, 1944, 266-291. Writing of Lewin's use of the concept of 'force' London says, . as a dynamic construct force is basically an anthropomorphic concept, for an agent is made responsible for variations in behavior . . if it is impossible to account for an item of behavior, it is always possible to invent an agent to cause it" (p. 267). *Cartwright, op. cit., this JOURNAL, 54, 1941, 188 f.</page><page sequence="4">INTENSITY OF ATTITUDE AND DECISION TIME 513 Remmers' generalized scale for the measurement of attitude toward any institution.1o These statements seem especially applicable to the measurement of attitude toward the Catholic Church and cover a wide range of opinion, with a Thurstone scale-value of 10.8 for the most favorable item and a scale value of 1.7 for the least favorable item. An equal number of favorable and unfavorable items was chosen. Two sets of measures were obtained for each O: (1) measures of deci- sion-time for acceptance or rejection of each statement; (2) measures of the intensity with which each statement was accepted or rejected. Each O was tested individually according to a standardized procedure. The following instructions were read. I have here a number of statements all of which are about the Catholic Church. I am going to read each one, and when I am through I would like you to answer yes if you agree with the statement, or no if you do not agree. Though it would be interesting to hear gradations of opinion about each statement, the purposes of this experiment require only that you answer yes to indicate agreement and no to indicate disagreement. If you are not certain as to what your opinion is on a given statement, try to make a judgment anyway whether the balance tips to the side of agreement or disagreement, and answer yes or no accordingly. The statements were then read by E in prearranged random order. Decision-times were measured with a 1/5-sec. stop-watch by an assistant who sat in a room adjacent to the experimental room, out of sight of both E and O. Time was measured from the instant E's voice ceased to the instant a yes or no response was made by O. This method of timing is not as accurate as one might wish, and a voice-key circuit would have been preferable. But, in order to keep the Os in ignorance of the purpose of the experiment and to make it appear as a simple attitude test, the use of obvious timing equipment was avoided. Knowledge on the part of the Os that they were being timed would probably have hastened their responses unduly. After the decision-times had been recorded, E again presented the entire series of statements to O, requesting him to assign to each statement an intensity rating on an 11-point scale, 0 indicating strong disagreement with the statement, 10 indicating strong agreement, 5 relative indifference, with the intermediate degrees of intensity scaled along the continuum. These ratings provided a measure of the intensity of acceptance or rejec- tion of each statement. 10o H. H.

DECISION-TIME AS A FUNCTION OF INTENSITY OF ATTITUDE</page><page sequence="6">INTENSITY OF ATTITUDE AND DECISION TIME 515 RESULTS Figs. 1-28 show, for each individual O, average decision-times as a function of intensity ratings. Most of the graphs show a single peak of decision-time at or near the central scale-value, i.e., at or near the point indicating relative indifference to the statement judged. Eight of the 28 cases show bimodal distributions. In virtually all cases decision-times drop considerably as the extremes of the scale are approached. Fig. 29 shows decision-times as a function of intensity ratings averaged for the 28 Os. In order to eliminate the effect of individual differeces, the decision-time of each O for each intensity rating was converted into fractions (or multiples) of his own average decision- time. For example, if an O's average decision-time was 3 sec., and his decision- time for intensity rating 5 was 6 sec., he was given a score of 2; if his decision-time for intensity rating 0 was 1 sec., he was given a score of .33; and so on for all Os and all intensity ratings. By this process of con- version the data from all Os were rendered comparable and the results for the group as a whole could be summarized. The group-results show a unimodal curve of decision-time, rising from a relative time of .44 for intensity rating 0, to a peak of 2.16 at intensity rating 5, and gradually dropping to .49 at intensity rating 10. All ordinate values are multiples or fractions of the average decision-time. The slopes of the two symmetrical curves in Fig. 29 suggested a logarithmic relationship. The data were, therefore, replotted, as shown in Fig. 30, with the logarithms of relative decision-times as a function of intensity ratings. The points cluster around two straight lines, one for the ascending values of decision-time (left half of the curve) and one for the descending values of decision-time (right half of the curve). Using the method of least squares, the equations of the best fitting straight lines were found to be as follows: Ascending values: log y = .45 + .15x Descending values: log y = .62 + .13x Inspection of Fig. 30 shows that the discrepancies between expected and obtained values are relatively small. Most of the obtained values fall within the limits of the standard error of estimate (.053 and .074 respectively). The logarithmic relationship indicates that</page><page sequence="7">516 POSTMAN AND ZIMMERMAN decision-times vary geometrically as intensity ratings are scaled arithmetically. DIscussIoN Our results show that decision-time is a systematic function of intensity of attitude. The more intense O's attitude toward a given subject, the less time he will take to decide whether he accepts or re- jects a statement that has activated his attitude.

LOG (DECISION-TIME) AS A FUNCTION OF INTENSITY OF ATTITUDE which O professes indifference, i.e., for statements which arouse neither a strongly favorable nor a strongly negative attitude. The area of indifference along the attitude continuum may be regarded as analogous to Cartwright's border of two ranges of equivalent stimuli. The two ranges in this case are (1) the range of statements that arouse an attitude of acceptance in O; (2) the range of statements that arouse an attitude of rejection in O. The statements toward which O is indifferent are analogous to stimuli yielding a 50 percent fre- quency in psychophysical experiments with two categories of judg- ment. Such statements are equally likely to be accepted and rejected. and it is for these statements that the longest average decision-times were obtained.</page><page sequence="8">INTENSITY OF ATTITUDE AND DECISION TIME 517 The results of this experiment, using complex attitude statements as stimulus-material, provide additional evidence for the generaliza- tion that decision-time becomes longer as the border of two ranges of equivalent stimuli is approached and that decision-time is a measure of the relative strength of the conflicting alternatives. A number of the graphs for individual Os show a bimodal distribution of decision-times and at first glance might seem to contradict our general hypothesis. It is simpler, however, to regard them as special cases mani- festing the same general principles of judgment as have been postulated for the great majority of our cases. When there is a bimodal curve of decision-time, we may assume that O was responding to three rather than two ranges of equivalent stimuli, e.g., statements which he accepts fully, statements which he accepts with reservation, and statements which he rejects. The two peaks may then be assumed to lie at the borders of these ranges. Such deviations inevitably result from O's reinterpretation of the experimental instructions. This analysis of the deviant cases is supported by some of the results obtained by Cartwright who experimentally induced bimodal curves of decision-time." The results of this experiment make it possible to give mathematical expression to the relation between intensity of attitude and decision- time. For our data the relationship proves to be logarthmic: with intensity ratings scaled along a linear continuum relative decision- times vary geometrically. It is certainly premature to say whether this relationship represents a general principle of decision-time or is an artifact of our particular scaling procedure. We should note, however, that a similar generalization made by Johnson regarding the relation between confidence of judgment and decision-time suggests that the logarithmic relationship may prove fundamental.12 The exact mathe- matical nature of the relationship between the attributes of the stimulus-material and the length of decision-time needs to be further investigated. We suggest that a great many more empirical functions need to be carefully analyzed before the quantification of such variables as "potency of the situation" and "restraining force" ceases to be conceptually topheavy.'3 The findings of this experiment have practical implications.

Cartwright and Festinger, op. cit., passim.</page><page sequence="9">518 POSTMAN AND ZIMMERMAN many psychological experiments and public opinion polls the re- spondents are confronted with questions to which they have to answer either yes or no. In the tabulation and interpretation of the results all yes answers are pooled and given equal weight, and simi- larly all no answers. Yet a yes that reflects a strongly favorable attitude should be given greater weight in predicting action than a yes answer given after much doubt and vacillation. Public opinion analysts are aware of this problem and have used various devices to gauge the intensity of attitude underlying responses to dichotomous questions.'4 Measurements of decision-time could provide students of public opinion with an additional device for evaluating the reliability of responses in questionaries and polls. SUMMARY Cartwright has suggested a general theory of decision-time accord- ing to which decision-time becomes longer as the border of two ranges of equivalent stimuli is approached. This theory has been verified with a variety of stimulus-materials and under unlike experimental conditions. This paper adds further evidence in cor- roboration of the general theory by showing its validity with stimulus- material of great complexity, viz. attitude statements. A Thurstone-type of scale for the measurement of attitude toward the Catholic Church was administered to 28 Os. The Os were re- quired to accept or reject each of the 20 statements of the scale, and their decision-times were recorded. The Os then indicated the in- tensity of their acceptance or rejection along an 11-point scale. Plotting decision-times as a function of intensity ratings, a uni- modal distribution of decision-times was obtained with the peak at the center of the intensity continuum. Further analysis showed that the relation between intensity of attitude and decision-time is logarithmic. With intensity ratings scaled on an arithmetic continuum, decision-times vary geometrically. The results of this experiment are interpreted as verifying the generalization that decision-time is maximal at the border of two ranges of equivalent stimuli. The two ranges in this case are a range of acceptance and a range of rejection of attitude statements. ' Cf. H.
