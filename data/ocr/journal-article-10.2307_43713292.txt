<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph Reindl, Das Angesicht Gottes im Sprachgebrauch des Alten Testa- ments (Erfurter Theologische Studien 25; Leipzig: St. Benno Verlag, 1970). Pp. xxvi + 351. Paper DM 20. This study of the Hebrew word paním ("countenance" or "face") is nothing if not a parade example of the storied German Gruendlichkeit. Its 351 pages include, besides the body of the work, no less than 665 notes (many of them sizeable discussions or statistical tabulations) and three detailed indexes. Sometimes, inevitably, Reindl appears to belabor the obvious or to do no more than detail the givenness of a situation. However, the simple statistics alone suggest the importance of the study for any biblical scholar: pãním appears 2109 times in the Hebrew text, referring over a quarter of those times to God's "face." The fact that over half of the total uses (1688 to be exact) are in prepositional combinations where the original force of the noun often all but vanishes completely does not ultimately alter the results. The general caution of R.'s conclusions appears to enhance the value of the work. Although never explicitly mentioned, the strictures of Barr and others against placing excessive weight on word-meanings apart from context appear to have borne fruit here, however indirectly. In fact, the bulk of the work is divided into the three aspects of: (1) God's countenance as subject; (2) God as subject, with his countenance as object; and (3) man</page><page sequence="2">1972] Book Reviews and Short Notices 243 as subject, with God's countenance as object. In all three divisions, both the main idioms in which pãním appears as well as their contexts are subjected to detailed scrutiny. In the third and final section of the book, R. summarizes topically the results of his investigation. R.'s most significant conclusion is probably that pãním represents no theo- logoumenon or Erscheinungsform whatsoever, but is commonly used to under- score Yahweh's personal intervention. This corresponds to its frequent use pars pro toto for the whole person, often requiring translation with a reflexive pronoun or the like, or even appearing to be a redundancy of an expansive style. It is a chief means of expressing God's real presence, especially in the sanctuary. The entire ritual action occurs "before (the face of) Yahweh." Obviously, the crass literalism of an idol's "face" cannot be posited of the Israelite Temple, but R. argues cogently that the idiom would never even have arisen in Israel had there been no belief in a real presence of another sort. At the same time, R. argues, pace Nötscher, Wieser, and others, that pãním has no special or intrinsic reference to the ark or to theophanic ceremonies. In general, he contends that while many pãním-iáioms were used with reference to the cult, they usually were not rooted there, but represented instead mere anthropomorphic applications to the deity. Hence, not only liturgical action, but ultimately all religious life could be described as taking place coram Deo . Analysis of usage in various authors or traditions leads to the conclusion that talk about God's "face," while widespread throughout the OT, never became stereotyped, but was repeatedly reformulated for new situations. By R.'s calculations, in the Pentateuchal sources, the two poles are represented by E, where pãním- idioms scarcely appear at all, and P, where "before Yahweh" virtually becomes a technical term for cultic action, apparent especially in combinations and applications which appear nowhere else. A unique cultic application or two is seen to appear in D also, but to a far lesser degree, and also in J, /&gt;āwzM-expressions are judged probably not to be native material. In the prophets, the vocable appears often enough (Amos being the most notable exception), but with typical prophetic variety and freedom. Especially in the Psalter, however, the pânîm-ex pressions come into their own, in frequency second only to P. Here, we especially meet either negatively formulated prayers that God's face not be hidden or positive petitions for it to "shine," etc., and with three main goals: for some theophany, for judgment, or for certainty of standing or living "before Yahweh."
