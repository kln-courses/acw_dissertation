      <p>Nobody who has seen the images of the late nineteenth‐century French artist Odilon Redon will easily forget them. One‐eyed polyps suspended over the seashore, giant fuzzy spiders smilingly swooping down to greet you, uncanny humanoid single cells or anthropomorphic flowers hovering in some timeless void—these images lodge themselves in your mind and haunt you forever. The art historian Barbara Larson’s splendid study of Redon examines how the artist achieved these effects by haunting the worlds of late nineteenth‐century science and becoming the voice of its unconscious fantasies and anxieties.</p>
      <p>Odilon Redon came of age in the Franco‐Prussian war of 1870–1871, and for the next three decades he produced stunning, unforgettable images that spoke to the dreams, anxieties, and longings of <italic>fin‐de‐siècle</italic> France. Before 1870 Redon had already completed substantial training as a naturalist landscape painter in the tradition of the Barbizon school, aspiring to paint in the manner of Pierre Étienne Théodore Rousseau and Jean Baptiste Camille Corot. Redon also pursued studies at the Ecole des Beaux‐Arts, learning anatomy and human figure painting with Jean‐Léon Gérôme and following the scientific lectures of Louis Pasteur, who was appointed to the first science chair at the art academy on the heels of his famous controversy with George Pouchet over spontaneous generation.</p>
      <p>But Redon’s most important scientific training came in the 1860s with an informal apprenticeship to the botanist Armand Clavaud, whom he accompanied in fieldwork in marshlands near Bordeaux. From Clavaud he acquired a passion for subjects that would inform much of his art: plant physiology, cell biology, and microbiology. Clavaud also initiated Redon into Haeckelian idealist and pantheist ruminations on the individual “living personality” of plants and the morphological homologies of the descent tree. Redon’s philosophical ties to Clavaud initiated him into the familiar dual life of many nineteenth‐century scientists, who adhered to strict protocols of public communication while carrying out rich private speculative or spiritual work around their science. Historians often excavate traces of these private cultures of scientists from archival sources. But Redon’s career demonstrates that certain artists, involved with science but unfettered by the constraints of scientific publication, can reveal much about the private cultures of science. It is reasonable to assume that Redon’s biological visions publicized an imaginary widely shared by late nineteenth‐century scientists. Pasteur acknowledged this dimension of Redon’s contribution when he remarked that it took the hand of Redon to give life to monstrosities.</p>
      <p>When evolutionary biology became a semiofficial element of the ideology of the French Third Republic, Redon’s drawings offered an often dark or satirical foil to the optimistic progressivism of the state. The lithograph series <italic>Origins</italic> (1883), for example, illustrated human beginnings from spermatozoa to unicellular organisms and several embryological fish‐animal‐humanoid forms emerging from the sea to take ultimate form as primitive humans. But the evolutionary series is marked by several monstrous or ambiguous life forms, such as the “misshapen polyp [which] floated on the shores, a sort of smiling and hideous cyclops” (p. 67). French evolutionary biology in this period extolled Charles Darwin but in practice usually hewed closely to “tranformist” principles drawn from the biological tradition of Lamarck, Cuvier, and Geoffroy Saint‐Hilaire. Tranformist biology, as we know from the work of Yvette Conry and Pietro Corsi, produced its own unique biological outlook and research agenda. Larson carefully charts Redon’s explorations of its crucial themes: evolution and degeneration, embryology, microbes, human prehistory, anthropology, psychology and psychiatry, and even debates about extraterrestrial life. Each of these areas had its own received iconography in the scientific or popular literature. Larson frequently juxtaposes the conventional scientific images with Redon’s unique and unforgettable visions of different phenomena. Similarly, her use of the scholarly literature to illuminate the background to Redon’s work themes is impressively thorough and judicious.</p>
      <p>Larson surpasses all previous scholarship in linking Redon’s scientific interests to the social and political ramifications of scientific debates in the early Third Republic. Fearful symbols of evolutionary memory often coincided with haunting images of secular history. Redon’s images of prehistoric battling savages evoked persistent French anxieties about crowds or political mob violence. Images of monstrous microbes, such as those of <italic>The Masque of Red Death,</italic> similarly conjured images of the typhoid epidemic of the 1880s, which claimed the life of Redon’s brother Leo, a medical doctor. Many of his images explored the worlds of the invisible or infinitely small popular in the public conception of science. Redon typically reworked these images as foreboding symbols of organic memory, the detritus of the human unconscious, or sometimes as adorable little Teletubby‐like creatures that had sprung from pond swill or arrived from a distant galaxy. In <italic>The Eye‐Balloon,</italic> for example, an eyeball, reminiscent of the flower‐eye or polyp, takes shape as a hot‐air balloon floating over ocean and seashore. Here, as elsewhere, Larson’s interpretative approach reads the image in historical context, deftly joining the multiple social meanings of ballooning with Redon’s biological imagery.</p>
      <p>When French intellectual fashion tilted away from positivist science toward idealism, supernaturalism, theosophy, and symbolism in the 1890s, Redon’s reputation soared. His images had always emphasized a spiritualized view of life, even when they expressed anticlerical themes. Similarly, his explorations of the themes of Charcot’s psychiatry—dreams, somnambulism, suggestibility, and the like—prepared him for a full embrace of the Symbolist movement. Like others who came to Symbolism from science (e.g., Gustave Kahn, Villiers de l’Isle Adam, Charles Cros, Georges Seurat), Redon understood Symbolist aesthetics as a technology of the psyche, an exercise in mediating the material and the spiritual. In this way he prefigured the Surrealists, to whom he is often compared, in more that just the pursuit of fantasy. Redon held clear views about how his sparse technique, limited to “the resources of chiaroscuro” and “the rhythm of mentally conceived lines,” involved the spectator “by means of a sudden attraction, in all the allure of the uncertain” (p. 135). Redon did much of his best work in charcoal, believing it a substance having “the fundamental quality of primary matter of the universe,” while its black color “originates in the deepest recesses of our being” (p. 40).</p>
      <p>Larson provides remarkable analyses of Redon’s artistic resources. While the proliferating images of popular science formed a constant frame of historical reference, Redon took inspiration from a variety of artistic traditions. Many of his images exhibit the stunning inventiveness of Victorian graphic artists like Granville, Rodolphe Bresdin, or Gustave Doré. But they also have some of the dark mysticism of Francisco Goya, or the luminous supernaturalism of nineteenth‐century artists like Gustave Moreau and the Germans Arnold Böcklin and Max Klinger, or the ethereal mysticism of Maurice Denis or Pierre Bonnard. All of the artists whom Redon admired were distinguished by their craftsmanship, a quality that he emphasized in living nature as well as in art. Accordingly, the craftsmanship of the images Larson has assembled demands a book formatted to bring them to life. This desideratum has been realized splendidly in the very high production values of <italic>The Dark Side of Nature.</italic> In its look and feel it bears the mark of a devoted collaboration between a knowing author and a publisher committed to producing a book of very high quality.</p>
