<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. O'Neill, Five Bodies , the Human Shape of Modern Society, Ithaca and London, Cornell University Press, 1985 $17.50. 181 pp. In recent years there has been a spate of major publications on the sociology of the body; these would include D. Armstrong Political Anatomy of the Body (1983), P. Freund The Civilised Body (1982), L. Hudson Bodies of Knowledge (1982), and D. Levin The Body's Recollection of Being (1985). Within this flurry of re-interpretation of our material presence within the world, O'Neill has produced a lively and stimulating critique of contemporary capitalism via a commentary on anthropomorphism. The main theme of Five Bodies is that we are alienated from the naive and spontaneous enjoyment of our bodies as a consequence of industrialisation, the rationalisation of experience and the impact of scientific knowledge which trans- forms our bodies into the objects of knowledge and power. O'Neill's critique of con- temporary culture rests self-consciously on the work of M. Foucault (although Foucault's contribution is not exposed to rigorous scrutiny within this text). In the introduction on 'our two bodies', O'Neill explores the complicated nature of our embodiment where we have a physical presence within our bodies but also a moral location within our lived embodiment. In chapter one the book explores the issue of anthropomorphism arguing that we 'naturally' experience the world through our bodies and that the body provides the most fundamental and primitive metaphor of our social experience. In chapter two O'Neill, in a somewhat conventional way, follows the implications of M. Douglas' anthropology of purity and danger for an analysis of the soçial dimensions of embodiment. Under the notion of the 'body politic' O'Neill explores the traditional physical metaphors for the political order and, in particular, considers the work of Kantorowicz on the king's two bodies as the basis of a series of socio-political metaphors of stability. It will be recalled that this provided the opening problem for Foucault in his study Discipline and Punish (1979). The most stimulating section of O'Neill's recent study occupies the conclusion where he turns to the problem of consump- tion where our bodies are regulated by artificial needs created by advertising and finally to the médicalisation of our embodi- ment under the dominance of science where our emotional existence is regulated by the requirements of a dominant medical profession. The underlying theme of this critique is that we have lost our naive social embodiment in reality and have become the objects of rational science, especially through the medium of modern medicine. We are strangely disembodied by virtue of the artificial reality set up by consumerism, political control and scientific discourse. The remedy which O'Neill proposes appears to be a return to familialism. Thus, he asserts that 'there is reason to believe that we need more than ever to re-invent the family as a respon- sible unit of action regarding the welfare of its</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 141 members in matters of education, consump- tion and general health' (p. 1 17). This return to social origins is the contemporary manifestation of O'Neill's well established argument that we need a wild sociology in order to 'make sense together'. This book could be criticised on a variety of grounds. For example, it does not develop a dialectical view of the positive and negative dimensions of contemporary patterns of con- sumption, education and health, seeing these dimensions of society as wholly negative. There is a strong argument in favour of consumption as a dimension of modern forms of liberation. The drift of contemporary sociology appears to be towards a positive re-evaluation of the significance of consump- tion against production. While O'Neill wishes to follow Foucault, he is mainly concerned with the body of individuals rather than the body of populations, and fails, therefore, to provide an adequate social demography of embodiment. In addition, O'Neill fails to drawn upon the recent development of French sociology which has grounded its notion of embodiment in the work of Nietzsche. The result is that O'Neill concentrates mainly on the problem of need but fails completely to provide an analysis of desire and pleasure. One further consequence of this is that O'Neill fails in any significant way to provide a social phenomenology of embodiment. However, the main criticism of O'Neill would have to focus on his essentially nostalgic and romantic conceptualisation of the body. Nostalgia was originally a disease of monks who suffered from melancholy described variously as 'tristitia' or 'acedia'. Nostalgia manifested itself in the drying out of the body where the dryness of monastic bodies reflected their desert environment. O'Neill has produced a dry and nostalgic overview of modern capitalism which is shaped by the dominant metaphor of Weber's sociology - the loss of paradise as a consequence of the dominance of modern knowledge. The result is a puritanical, backward looking and con- servative vision of modern society which is uni-dimensional and lacking in sociological complexity.
