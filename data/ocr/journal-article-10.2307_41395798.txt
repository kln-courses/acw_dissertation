<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science Fiction and Its Ideas By Robert H. West I URELY rather fewer nude blonds are really murdered in New York than mystery stories might lead us to suppose, and the sporting confrontation with six shooters was probably not nearly so common in the old west as in the new western. Perhaps, too, sex practices are less unbridled in a large proportion of our population than the paper back "love" novel suggests. A man looking for an accurate or profound picture of our culture would not be likely to depend much on our drugstore bookracks. Just the same, westerns, detectives, and sex novels portray something true about our culture, and if they are not profound, still they do in- clude some generalizations that large numbers of us subscribe to. Westerns are certainly exaggerated, but the old West was wild; detective tales are rather more attention-getting than their analogues in criminology and come out more neatly; but crimes are committed and sometimes solved. As for sex, it is usually less lurid than the thirty-five cent sex tales, but it undoubtedly goes on and probably frenzied enough, too. Besides these general correspondences to fact, the paperbacks have also an insensitive correspondence to some re- spected general views about the nature of things. Westerns express a clean sort of elementalism that perhaps lots of people believe in, or think they do; the struggle is tough, even mortal, but the good cling to their goodness and deserve our sympathy and the bad get what's coming to them. The sex tales and many of the detectives, on the other hand, are a dirty sort of elementalism; the passion they tell of is fetid, but its force excuses its stink, or if not who cares? For life is just making the most of what you may be born with, and its chief principle is to live it up while you can. Anyone who fought in our recent wars will have heard such "philosophy" in the mouths of ordinary Americans. All this is pretty unorganized; probably neither the author nor the reader of the usual western or detective, much less of the sex novel, takes a great deal of interest in philosophizing about either the fie- li 276 ]</page><page sequence="2">SCIENCE FICTION AND ITS IDEAS 277 tional world or the real one. Tell the story; pass the hour; and that's it for these paper backs. Very different from them, in its own opinion at least, is their com- panion on the rack, the science-fiction tale. For science fiction, claims one of its editors, is unique there: in it alone are both author and reader more interested in ideas than in story. Taken strictly, this claim may be a bit too large, but the fact certainly is that compared with its paperback companions science fiction is loaded with ideas, ideas ex- pressed, it seems to many a layman, with a clarity, a rigor, and an authority that belongs to nothing less than science itself. This fiction does indeed speak of many sciences spectacularly triumphant and of startling notions that stem from science. Sometimes, too, it voices ideas that science really has viewed with interest or even endorsed. One story, for instance, makes such points as that to judge a scientific hypothesis except by its success in prediction is "bloody bad science," that "man's brains simply don't work the right way for telepathy" because "everything is based on D. C. voltages," and that an irrational attitude toward "love" will lead to early exhaustion of earth's "supply of chemical foods." Much more adventurously another story explains at length (on the authority of a "wave synthesizer" which translates waves men cannot sense into intelligible nerve im- pulses) that man's foetal period is really the "afterlife" our "religions tell of." Yet a third relates how all humanity became psychically united through a universal telepathy: "... it was abruptly possible for mankind to live with itself in health. . . . When humanity became a hive, and needed something . . . the device was produced without consideration of pride or profit, without waste motion, without inter- personal friction. ..." And a fourth story, much quieter-seeming but actually as extravagant, says crisply after much pseudo-scientific cor- roboration that "happiness" is the only end proper to man and that for its sake we will learn to live together. It is no relief when at last this story turns to "liberty" of a sort as a superior end. Needless to say, the layman who accepts any of these ideas after the first as possessing either the rigor or the authority of science is largely in error. Science fiction is too wildly hypothetical, too much shaped by the needs of its adventure fiction to preserve more than a distant illusion of being like science. Still, its "ideas" are often genuine, however far-fetched, and they are often strongly and imaginatively</page><page sequence="3">278 THE GEORGIA REVIEW expressed. Many of them have at least this real connection with science: they are about society as it might be when re-shaped by scientific discoveries which, though yet unmade, bear a family resemblance to those that have been made and are already dear to our time. Science fiction has this further connection with science: scientific men write much of it, and plainly not without a proselytizing intention. When Wernher Von Braun tells of a trip to Mars he is opening our eyes to its possibility- and to its desirability. The well-known English astronomer Fred Hoyle plainly shows his partiality to science and to scientists in his The Black Cloud , though he called it a "frolic." Arthur E. Clarke notes that the opinions in his Childhoods End are not those of the author; but when in telling his story that author voices such opinions as that "once science had declared a thing possible there was no escape from its eventual realization," he certainly does not leave the impression of belying himself. Still, the feature that may make science fiction worth the atten- tion of one who would examine our times is not so much the tacit sanction of some scientists who write it as the wide audience that likes to read more seriously than the writers write. Science fiction expresses the way that many of us common men think, when we do think, about government, society, man and nature, the past and the future, and the origins and ends of things. Such matters science fiction touches explicitly and repeatedly. Past question, what it says about them calls out to the layman who lives aware of science. I don't mean to say that science fiction is penetrating enough or persuasive enough in itself to influence the masses decisively for change, but rather that many of us see in it something of the world as we already think it to be. Science fiction is a mirror of common opinion. It is a kind of selective looking glass for what we may consider our best-informed and most emancipated views. Here, we think, is no nonsense except that up-to-date nonsense that raises morale by a bold assumption of our destiny in science, an energetic fatalism that we will be able to go wherever science points. Quite possibly these advanced views are, many of them, as cheap and ill-founded as their extravagant showing in the fiction may lead us to suspect. But certainly they are endemic among us, and science fiction organizes them in some detail.</page><page sequence="4">SCIENCE FICTION AND ITS IDEAS 279 II I am not talking here of the kind of writing occasionally done by such littérateurs as Aldous Huxley, E. M. Forster, С. S. Lewis, and George Orwell. Their work is long on social satire and literary skill, and short on technical detail. And they do not, by and large, love science or science's way with things. Brave New World despairs of the scientific Utopia, and Lewis's novels of space and the future are a counter-cry against science. God's angels, Lewis seems to say, are more credible in both this world and others than what science fiction peoples them with. True science fiction keeps science and its results in the center of its focus and does it with an almost touching conviction of science's successes and of its supreme importance and even of its essential good- ness. This discipleship, though sometimes naive and often extravagant, is yet in its way faithful to science. It speaks up with a sort of proprietary scorn whenever its stories call for allusion to "supersti- tion" or "tradition" or some other body of beliefs that science holds to be baseless. It makes what seems to the layman, at least, a good show of technical detail. And, most to its credit, it largely eschews rhapsody and cosmic optimism; admiring the successes of science it yet does not take them to be total or final. Science fiction cannot, of course, preserve scientific soberness in all of its imaginings; it cannot really mate scientific scepticism to its interest in the romantic pos- sibilities of space and time. But just the same it does exhibit a kind of scientism, however tawdry. Science fiction pictures the world we know as transformed by the spectacular application of a prodigiously expanded technology. It is at ease with travel in time and in outer space, with computers and other robots having a mental life of their own and able to compute both past and future, with rays for atomizing and even for re-assembling solid objects. It tells of scientific refinements of language and logic that allow not only accurate statement of vast new "truths" but positive control of nature as well, and of a "neurology" that enables some conditioned creatures of the future to fly between the stars by sheer nerve power. Such commonplaces of science fiction nobody takes seriously in themselves, perhaps; that is, nobody supposes them near at hand (except</page><page sequence="5">28o THE GEORGIA REVIEW flight in the solar system?) or inevitable for even the distant future. But the social, historical, and moral consequences, however extreme, that flow from them in their fictional world have an evident kinship with those from the less startling technology actual in our time. Acceptance of either set, the fictitious or the actual, is a sort of acclimatization for the other. If we accept the consequences of, say, automation, the "teaching machine," depth psychology, and the con- struction methods invented by Mr. Buckminster Fuller we are the readier to accept those in science fiction from the humanoid robot, absolute mental conditioning of the young, language that can directly express the subconscious, and a kind of structural engineering that makes cities crystallize from bare designs. As we become easy with the fiction it in turn cushions the shock of the reality. Implicit in all these things, the real and the imaginary, is perhaps a kind of dehumanization. Advancing technology excludes man from some activities and values once his, and, more objectionable, points to man as himself a sort of technical construction. The artisan may disappear with automation; and builders of all sorts with the mentally projected city; the human teacher is lost as the teaching machine establishes its rule. The individual himself becomes less man and more machine as he gets his education by one kind or another of injection, and as his personality disappears in an impersonal unconscious or sub- conscious. These are old and arguable complaints against science and the scientific age; examination of science fiction, though it certainly does not contradict them, can hardly reinforce them much. But one thing is plain: science fiction's "ideas" mesh well with others born also of our new technology, gain acceptability from them, and con- tribute some acceptability to them. A sociologist, noting a survey which declares that scientists and technicians are numerically prominent among subscribers to science fiction magazines and book clubs, proposes as a reason for their interest the theory that science fiction expresses their "basic humanistic values." From certain points of view, both science and science fiction do foster "humanistic values" and so can hardly be said to imply "dehumaniza- tion." Science puts humanity in some command of nature, and this is a sort of humanism. Scientists are likely to take as their center of authority man himself, not any supernatural being; this, too, is a kind of humanism. Science finds its true and primary instrument to be</page><page sequence="6">SCIENCE FICTION AND ITS IDEAS 28 1 man's intellect, in the scientific exercise of which lies such chance of cosmic importance as man may have. This assumption of a kind of perfectibility in man is some sort of humanism. But in other senses, of course, science fiction, at least, whatever may be true of science itself, is not humanistic. It does not, for instance, value the whole of man- to do which would entail a kind of cherishing of humanity as we find it- but seems to favor those characteristics that serve science and are served by it. Possible atrophy of the rest, science fiction faces calmly; the arts are dim in it, despite some lip service. For another thing, science fiction is much less concerned with what ought to be than with what is and with the power derivable, less with man's responsibilities than with the things that determine him and that he can determine. This is not humanistic if, as many great humanists suppose, man's definitive characteristics are moral. And finally, whereas Christianity may be called humanistic in at least the sense that it puts man at the center (not of being certainly but of creation as God's chief creature and the object of His concern) science fiction allows no real importance in the universe for man except to himself nor any general prominence except as he may achieve it through a cultivated evolution. Science fiction takes a very long- distance look at man in his environment and indicates that he is ex- tremely small and frail in it and rather alien, and that as his critical consciousness grows so his alienation grows. Science fiction is itself man-centered, but it denies that the world is so or that the outside powers of the world aie substantially man-like or concerned with man. One of the most prominent imaginative feats of science fiction is to roll back the heavens for an inhumanly expanded horizon. Once you assume voyages in time and in outer space, then the universe of man's occupancy appears enlarged in a way analogous to the enlargement achieved geographically with the sixteenth century's exploration of America and imaginatively with its gradual realization that the earth was not at the center and that the stars might in fact be other worlds, inhabited by other sons of God than Adam's. The sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries had, however, no idea of the real immensity of space and of the statistical possibilities of other life in it. Kepler and Galileo did not really suppose that men lived on the heavenly bodies, and their speculations on it were condemned not because many took them se- riously but because they raised questions that seemed impious. Thomas</page><page sequence="7">282 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Heywood tried in 1635 to dramatize the impressive size of the universe by saying that an angel flying at top speed- 1000 miles per hour- would take more than six years to reach earth from the eighth sphere. This seems small to us when we hear that light itself takes hundreds of years or thousands to reach us from some stars and that millions of suns, perhaps with their planets, exist in a single galaxy. For these stupendous facts science itself vouches. Science fiction, preparing us, as one of its practitioners says, for space flight, tries to give an imagina- tive grasp of them and in doing so inevitably brings home how tiny earth and man are in comparison. In one book's "galactic empire" an average of fifty new worlds qualified everv day for membership by attaining a civilized population of at least a billion. In another book a confederation of only fifty solar systems with thirty billions of people is just a provincial backwater. In yet another, men assemble suns in a circle and make them burn with varicolored lights. In a fourth, forty million years pass between one chapter and the next. After these aeons, out of seventy thousand colonized worlds in the Milky Way more than three hundred call themselves Earth and no one remembers which was the parent planet. Most startling of all, perhaps, is a story in which a thousand year old tutor, now in his eightieth life within a billion years, explains to his student the primitive relation of mother to child and says that of course this natural means of birth was superseded at "the dawn of history." Before such sweeps of time and space and number and such alien achievements as birth out of a computer, all put with considerable imaginative power, the seas and continents of our world shrink, and its population and their problems lose importance. We begin to wonder what real difference the little old Bomb can make. Not onlv are time У and space ungraspingly huge, but they are full of rays that transcend our senses, of dimensions beyond the daily three, of speeds and tem- peratures that disintegrate flesh, and- much more at odds with our humanity- of scientific devices that harness these rays and dimensions and speeds and temperatures. Disintegrators take things apart down to their atomic charges and integrators put them safely together again in other times and places. Computers, accurately programmed, not only infer the past and future but even project artificial universes that then can live on their own logic. Topologists devise mirror systems</page><page sequence="8">SCIENCE FICTION AND ITS IDEAS 283 that unveil a theoretically infinite number of worlds simultaneous and coextensive with ours. Psychologists find means to know men's thoughts and wills and to control them directly. The refuge of death itself disappears as physicians become able to animate corpses and even to re-assemble dismembered ones. In the light of these and similar turns of science fiction, the vulgar philosophy of which it is a vehicle does not seem humane. But we grow familiar with it. Ill The sociologist who thinks that science fiction appeals to "hu- manistic values" claims also that it emphasizes human need for re- ligion, and this claim is defensible if religion is taken as he takes it to mean: simply man's move toward a "rendezvous with a greater purpose than his own." Science fiction does indeed talk sometimes of "purposes" that work through man and nature and shape them. But these are blind evolutionary forces, morally neutral, not really purposive at all; or they belong to conscious beings inhumanly mighty but finite, neither the creators of the universe nor its basic sustainers and directors. In short the "greater purposes" than man's that science fiction speaks of are either "nature," the subject of science, going on automatically in its ways, or they are a sort of magnification of the scientist. Thus a mysterious being about to intervene resistlessly in an inter-galactic war declares himself: "I am the end of evolution of a race so old the time cannot be expressed in words ... a race fused into a single entity, eternal ... an entity such as your race . . . might become." This supreme scientist is as near to deity as science fiction points us. Sometimes science fiction seems to admit what Fred Hoyle has a character refer to as the "deep problem": "how is it decided how matter shall behave? How are your laws of physics determined? Why these laws and no others?" But the concept of God is useless here, says Hoyle's authoritative speaker, since it is illogical and anthropomorphic. When science fiction itself enters into "deep problems" its answer usually gives the world as random, not purposive. Thus the story of an extraordinary machine made to "know and tell the truth," made so that "there could be no slightest error in the logic of its calcula- tions." It answered only two questions and its answers were: "The</page><page sequence="9">2 84 THE GEORGIA REVIEW universe has no purpose. The universe just happened." And "Life has no significance. Life is an accident." Neither, according to science fiction, has the universe a beginning or an end: " . . . carrying its little bit of human civilization, the ex- peditionary ship Space Beagle sped at ever increasing velocity through a night that had no end. And no beginning." Nor has it any creator or master. And certainly no compassion. This, says one science fiction tale proudly, is itself the true religion, and man's glory is to face it. In its free sweeps through history of earth and other plajiets science fiction is generally scornful of any age of faith and most particularly of our middle ages, the like of which, says one author, the Venusians were lucky enough to escape entirely. The ideal ages of man in science fiction usually boast their sensible secularity, and the persons it most scorns are theologians and "hard shell baptists." This distaste for established religion does not mean, of course, that science fiction is free from morality and ethics. As a matter of fact, it presents with evident approval the standard liberal morality of our time. The virtue- and the good sense- of mass education, birth control, racial integration, and political union it takes for granted. With the popular ballot it is not quite so easy, for it has a platonic notion that the elite, namely the scientists, ought to rule. Still, it is generally demo- cratic in taking the welfare of the populace as important in political decisions and systems. Says one scientist who can rule and- for the good of his galaxy- does so: "... our ethical measuring rod should be that which benefits the greatest number, provided it doesn't include extermination or torture of, or denial of rights to, individuals who do not conform. Society has to learn to salvage the man who is ill or ignorant." Under this Benthamite principle, truly advanced galactic cultures outlaw war, of course, though strife of one kind or another has a way of renewing itself in even the most scientific society. For old-fashioned personal morality science fiction has only reduced room. Its personal clashes are usually too elemental or too strongly rational in cause and conduct for much concern with things like chivalry or fair play, and the debts its characters pay and the ways they pay them are often almost too complex for personal honesty. As to sex, what one fictioneer calls the "Puritan aberration" is as foreign to the cultures of science fiction as it was to that of Caligula's Rome. Personal attachments of most sorts tend to get lost in the impersonal</page><page sequence="10">SCIENCE FICTION AND ITS IDEAS 285 complexities of machine-dominated living, except as part of the con- ventional little romances sometimes knitted in for the sake of "story interest." Most often science gets credit for the absence of emotional morality. As a scientist, snorts Hoyle's fictional mouthpiece, he is "concerned with facts, not with motives, suspicions, and airy-fairy nothingness." In knowledge and in education to its use, says another scientist hero, lies man's true goal: "... there can be no excuse for any individual not knowing what is possible for him to know. . . . Why should he stand under the sky of his planet and look up at it with the stupid eyes of superstition and ignorance, deciding vital issues on the basis of somebody's fooling him." The speaker has himself been stupendously trained through hypnotism and is on the point of using hypnotic compulsion- for the benefit of the greatest number, to be sure- against a whole ship's company. If this act were wrong, he explains, his moral conditioning would never let him do it without the extremest mental disturbance. Thus by the device of predetermined and resistless im- plantation the moralists of science fiction solve one of the most difficult problems of ethics: how to reconcile positively the inner mentor and the outer. IV My description of the "philosophy" that science fiction gives off is a sweeping one, and much might be put forward to modify some of its particulars. But the tone I have meant to suggest- one of combined aggression and stoicism- is certainly characteristic of science fiction's "ideas." On the one hand, nature is our oyster. Science fiction, says a prominent American practitioner, "has fostered . . . the great notion that the universe is an area of boundless potentiality. Science fiction . . . glorifies man and his future." But on the other hand: "Of the laws we can deduce from the external world one stands above all: the Law of Transcience. Nothing is intended to last." What, then, does this "philosophy" mean? Certainly it does not mean that the marvels science fiction dreams of are to take shape among us now or in any time soon enough to count with us practically. It is not really as prophecy that science fiction speaks, though writers often boast its successes as prophecy. Science fiction is not so much about man's future as about his nature telescopically viewed. It says</page><page sequence="11">286 THE GEORGIA REVIEW that he is important enough in the universe to possess some of it, but not important enough to last. He may preen himself on the "boundless potentiality" of his universe, but it can take no notice of him. He is his own creature and responsible to himself as a species, but not enough of a being for that responsibility to matter in most individuals. And the more exactly he knows and manages himself, by science's means, the more evident he makes it that in science's terms he is ultimately but a random combination of some sort, not an eternal center of being. Well, science fiction is not itself scientific expression, and science after all does not really cultivate it. Science fiction is a hanger-on. But even at that it appears to be one of the consequences of science, and so its "ideas" are, like more systematic naturalism, in a way traceable to science. It seems to grow in quantity and confidence as science grows and as the world grows that science enables. It reflects science's gains and science's society. What "really matters," says the fictionist I have quoted on the universe's "boundless potentiality," is "the attitude that is being fostered. Science fiction has helped ... to form the forward looking attitude." For origination of this attitude science fiction rightly or wrongly gives science first credit, and probably its readers do too. It is the attitude of the many men of our time who, rightly or wrongly, like also to give themselves credit for being in touch with science and sympathetic to it, for being made by it and for helping it to make others. The "ideas'* of science fiction are easy and seem lucid, sensa- tional and seem advanced, anti-traditional and seem free. As ideas they are of a kind that is and will be very popular and thus truly suggestive of an important face of our culture.</page></plain_text>
