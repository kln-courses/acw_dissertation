<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes on the Alice Hubbard Carpenter Collection Henry D. Wallace The legacy of Alice Carpenter must surely be measured in part by the research value of her narrative, the notes and documentation she retained on the artifacts she collected, the artifacts themselves, and her willingness to share her discoveries with professional archaeologists. During the course of our research into her collections and notes, many of the narrative sites have been identified (table 1). Others that remain unidentified could be readily relocated through some additional histor- ical research and fieldwork. Many sites that have collections are not mentioned in the narrative. Information on the identification of these sites is archived with the notes from this investigation, currently at the Center for Desert Archaeology in Tucson. As evident in her narrative, Alice witnessed significant vandalism and destruction of the sites she frequented. She was instrumental in pre- venting the destruction of the Fleiger mound when a local rancher at- tempted to bulldoze it. At other sites, she could but watch as portions were washed away with river floodwaters (the lower terrace occupation of High Mesa), or they were bulldozed and extensively vandalized. De- spite the damage she documents, much remains. The sites with plat- form mounds, which Alice called "towers," have all been relocated and at least roughly mapped (Doelle, Gregory, and Wallace 1995) with the exception of the Big Bell site that was destroyed in 1994 during a river- bank stabilization project. Most of these sites have suffered consider- able vandalism, but they retain tremendous research potential and many are visually imposing and likely to be of considerable interest to the public were they to be stabilized and available for public viewing. The Big Ditch site has also been mapped, and limited archaeological excavations were conducted there, which Alice participated in (ASM archives). Alice was a collector, and her collections include material from sites in the San Pedro, Oracle, and Black Hills areas, as well as from sites elsewhere in Arizona and from as far away as Egypt. Virtually any class</page><page sequence="2">352 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest of artifact imaginable is contained within her collection, from fulgurites (lightning- fused sand) to figurines, from whole pots to shell jewelry, and from textiles to bone rasps. Among the more unusual items in the collection thought to have originated from sites in the areas of interest here are a ceramic imitation of a Conus shell, 159 figurines and figurine fragments, an anthropomorphic-shaped stone slab, and a fulgurite from Camp Village. Close to one hundred pieces of shell jewelry are present in the collection, including one bracelet fragment with traces of green and red pigment. There are also more than 340 projectile points, ap- proximately 10 stone palettes, 5 tabular knives, 14 small stone bowls, 2 censors, 4 donut stones, 31 axes, 3 bone tubes, 10 modeled spindle whorls, and a range of other items. Most of all, the collection contains pottery, and that is the focus of the remainder of this article. The ceramic collection of Alice Carpenter numbers in excess of 9,672 sherds and 197 restorable or partially restorable vessels. Unlike many collectors, Alice recorded the sites from which the majority of the pottery came, and therein lies the collection's greatest value. Within the myriad bags and boxes she tucked away in her home in Oracle, there lay large numbers of pottery fragments that tell us much about the time periods during which the sites were occupied and the cultures and areas involved in commerce with them. The collection includes pottery im- ported into the San Pedro Valley from as far away as the Hopi Mesas and the upper Rio Grande area of New Mexico. It also include samples of pottery from sites now largely destroyed, such as Big Bell and the Old Hotel site. From October 1986 to March 1987, Linda Gregonis, W. Bruce Masse, and I systematically searched through all containers full of arti- facts collected by Alice Carpenter that had been left with her nephew, Tom Hubbard, when she died. An inventory of all artifact classes was made. Ceramic data were then transferred to computer coding forms and entered into a Foxpro database. Classification of the sherds re- quired mutual agreement. Problematic types and many of the intrusive wares were shown on three separate occasions to a range of researchers potentially familiar with the types, including Kelly Hayes, Alan Sullivan, J. Jefferson Reid, Stephanie Whittlesey, Barbara Montgomery, Nieves Zedeno, Alexander Lindsay, Richard Lange, Charles Adams, Christian Downum, and Steve Lekson. The opinions of these researchers have been taken into account in the following sherd identifications. Many of the whitewares remain unidentified and not all have been included in</page><page sequence="3">Collection Notes ■&gt; 353 the tallies reported herein pending future identification. The number of ceramic types represented in the collection is impres- sive. For sherds or vessels known to have originated within the area of interest here (the Lower San Pedro, Oracle, Tortolita, and Black Hills areas), seventy-three different pottery types or varieties were cata- logued. The distribution of the various types among these areas is listed in table 2. This table also provides some spatial control for the San Pedro Valley, splitting up segments of the region that correspond to particular groups of sites. For many of the artifacts, specific origin sites or even portions of sites are known, and these data are archived with our analysis notes. The largest quantity of any particular decorated ware in the collec- tion is buffware. Most of this material is thought to have been pro- duced in the Phoenix Basin, but 25 percent contains phyllite and was probably produced in the Aravaipa area (table 3). Two potential sources are known for phyllite in the vicinity of Aravaipa Creek, though neither have yet been confirmed to be the source of the material. The distribu- tion of the phyllite-tempered, "Aravaipa Variant" buffware centers on the Big Ditch site at Aravaipa Creek. Sherds of this locally produced buffware are present on sites from Winkelman to Mammoth, but are extremely rare on sites further south. They were also recovered in small numbers from the Oracle and Black Hills area sites. The Aravaipa Vari- ant buffware is comparable to its Phoenix Basin-produced counterparts in decorative style, though it bears noticeably thicker and less carefully drafted designs. Assuming comparability in style, the variant was first manufactured in the Gila Butte phase (a.d. 750 to 850), becoming most common in the Sacaton phase (a.d. 950 to 1150). The distribu- tion of Phoenix Basin buffware extends far beyond the limits of the Aravaipa Variant material, and is well represented at sites in the Mam- moth to Redington portion of the San Pedro Valley. It will be seen in table 2 that Cibola whitewares and White Moun- tain redwares are well represented among the imported wares. The col- lection also contains appreciable frequencies of the Salado Polychromes, including fourteen restorable vessels. San Carlos Red and San Carlos Red-on-brown ceramics are also commonplace, and the collection in- cludes thirty-five restorable or partially restorable vessels of these types. Most of the well-dated ceramic types predate A.D. 1350. Several, such as Gila and Tonto Polychrome, may date as late as a.d. 1400 or 1450. Included in the collection is one unprovenienced, unbroken Protohis-</page><page sequence="4">354 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest toric period plainware vessel thought to be from a rock shelter in the Santa Catalina Mountains. Given that it is nondescript, plain pottery, it is not surprising that the collection lacks significant quantities of the Protohistoric period wares. The pace of archaeological research in the San Pedro Valley and Tucson vicinity has picked up considerably in recent years. First terrace settings for the entire length of the San Pedro Valley from Benson to Winkelman have now been surveyed by the Center for Desert Archae- ology in Tucson, resulting in the documentation of slightly more than 500 archaeological sites. The pace of archaeological inquiry is not, however, keeping pace with developments in the valley that are threat- ening significant archaeological sites. The loss of the Big Bell site in 1994 may soon be followed by destruction of the Second Canyon plat- form mound site. It will only be a matter of time for other sites unless steps are made to preserve the rich heritage of the valley. Vandalism in the region has been increasing in recent years, and the author has seen pothunters on Camp Village and High Mesa. It is hoped that this pub- lication, documenting the devotion of one avocational archaeologist, will stimulate interest among other such interested persons and call at- tention to the need for a large-scale preservation program for the valley. One final note. Table 4 lists materials donated to the Arizona State Museum by Alice Carpenter and her friends Em Trowbridge and Scott Ramsey. The final disposition of her collection is not known at this time. Currently, it is housed at the Franklin Foundation Museum in Tucson, and a good number of artifacts from the collection are on display at the Oracle Public Library. As mentioned previously, the archival informa- tion on the collection is currently housed at the Center for Desert Ar- chaeology in Tucson. ■fr</page><page sequence="5">Collection Notes ■&gt; 355 REFERENCE Doelle, William H., David A.
