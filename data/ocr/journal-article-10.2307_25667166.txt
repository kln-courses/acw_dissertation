Johnson ABSTRACT By means of a contract with the National Park Service, and additional support from the University, the Department of Anthropology at the University of Kansas conducted archaeological salvage investigations in the northern part of the Tuttle Creek Reservoir of north-central Kansas in 1957. Excavations were con ducted at five sites, of which the Budenbender site (14P04) proved most productive. The present report describes excavations at Budenbender, the discoveries made, and interprets the data from the excavations in terms of current archaeological interest and taxonomic usages. The single house completely excavated at Buden bender is identified as a component of the Central Plains tradition, and is placed in the Smoky Hill regional variant of that tradition. INTRODUCTION During the summer of 1957, a field party from the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, conducted archaeological investiga tions along streams tributary to the Big Blue River near Frankfort in north-central Kansas. This activity was made possible by a contract with the National Park Service, as one aspect of the Inter-Agency Archeological Salvage Program designed to collect data from archaeological sites threatened by destruction from dams and reser voirs. The five archaeological sites investigated in 1957 have since been inundated by Tuttle Creek Reservoir. Tuttle Creek Reservoir is formed by an earthfill dam, 7350 feet long and 136 feet high, across the Big Blue River approximately six miles north of Manhattan, Kansas. The reservoir ex tends to the north an airline distance of nearly 40 miles, its upper limits reaching Marysville, Kansas. The average width of the reservoir is one and one-half miles. Approximately 9550 square miles, including sections of three Kansas coun ties, Riley, Pottawatomie, and Marshall, have been inundated by the reservoir. Wedel (1959:3-18) has provided a readily available summary of aspects of the natural environment of Kansas of especial importance to the prehistoric occupants, so this information need not be repeated in detail here. The follow ing comments will be limited to the local situation prior to the construction of Tuttle Creek Dam. The major stream, in the area investigated in 1957, is the Big Blue River which meanders southward from its headwaters in Nebraska until it joins the Kansas or Kaw River near Manhattan. In so doing, the river flows through a minor physiographic division, designated the Attenu ated Drift Border. This physiographic division is characterized by northeast-southwest trending scarps and valleys, a result of the differential erosion of Permian and Pennsylvanian limestones and shales. This basic scarp-valley topography is overlain in sections by deposits of drift, a result of at least two glacial advances. In these sections, the topography is undulating and more rounded than in the case of the unmodified scarp and valley portions (Schoewe 1949:280-91). Interbedded with deposits of limestone and shale, which determine the major characteristics of the local topography, are layers of chert, ranging in color from gray to blue. The chert provided a source of materials for the production of chipped stone artifacts. Also available in the local geological structure are extensive deposits of clay for the manufacture of ceramic artifacts. Glacial drift, overlying the limestone and shale deposits, includes numerous erratics, which pro vided a source of materials for ground and rough stone artifacts. Cobbles of pinkish Sioux quart zite were especially used for hammerstones. The valley of the Big Blue, cut through layers 271</page><page sequence="2">of thick, evenly-bedded limestone, slopes sharply upward on each side to gently rolling plains, covered by a heavy growth of grass. The rolling hiils enclosing the valley have never been broken by the plow, primarily due to numerous surface outcrops of limestone. In contrast, nearly all of the land in the river valley was utilized for agricultural pursuits. Forests were restricted, for the most part, to the immediate banks of the river, where elm, oak, cottonwood, and willow trees predominated. According to local inform ants, tree growth was heavier prior to white settlement, after which much of the land was cleared for farming. Numerous, spring-fed tributary streams enter the Big Blue at intervals along its course, the majority of them being short streams with their headwaters in the surrounding hills. Two larger tributary streams are the Black Vermillion and the Little Blue, which enter from the northeast and the northwest respectively. While the head waters for both of these streams are to be found in the surrounding rolling country, both flow a greater distance than other tributaries, and both consequently carry a greater quantity of water. According to historic records, the grass covered plains adjoining the valley of the Big Blue would have provided the prehistoric occu pants with a readily available supply of protein in the form of bison, antelope, and jackrabbit, while the valley itself sheltered many woodland animals such as deer, bear, racoon, opossum, beaver, and cottontail rabbit (Wedel 1959:14). Fresh water mussels and several varieties of fish were present in local streams. The annual precipitation in this portion of Kansas, as measured at Blue Rapids in Marshall county, is 28.30 inches, most of which falls as rain between May and September. The range in precipitation is from .60 inches in January to 4.44 inches in June (Flora 1948:61). Monthly average local temperatures range from 29.2 de grees in January to 80.2 degrees in July (Flora 1948:195). The average length of the growing season is 170 days, although this may range from 137 to 197 days. The last killing frost in the spring is usually about April 24, while the first killing frost in the fall is around October 11 (Flora 1948:223-9). A favorable climate, including abundant pre cipitation and an adequate growing season, com bined with the presence of excellent bottomland soils, have produced a region especially favorable to agriculture. That this situation was appreci ated by the prehistoric inhabitants is demon strated by the direct evidence of cultigens in charred form from archaeological sites. Initial archaeological investigations in the Tuttle Creek Reservoir were in 1952, when Ralph S. Solecki and J. M. Shippee conducted a survey for the Smithsonian Institution, River Basin Surveys (Solecki 1953). The sites located during this survey suggested that the reservoir area was occupied over a long span of time by Paleo-lndian, Archaic, Woodland, and Central Plains groups (Solecki 1953:21). Subsequent salvage work, by the River Basin Surveys, was carried out in 1953 by a party under the direction of R. B. Cumming and J. M. Shippee (Cumming 1958). During the 1953 season, excavations were made in the following sites (Cumming 1958:45-78): 1. Sweat Bee Mound (14P014), a small, rock covered burial mound of the Woodland per iod, with a late intrusive burial; 2. The Spillway site (14P012), an occupational area with possible relationships to the Glen Elder focus; 3. The Reany site (14P013), a habitation site with some European trade goods, possibly a protohistoric or early historic Kansas site; 4. 14RY10, an earthlodge village site perhaps related to the Nebraska aspect. The River Basin Surveys party made only preliminary excavations at 14RY10. Additional work at this site was accomplished during July of 1953 by a volunteer excavation party from Kansas State University, the University of Nebraska, and the River Basin Surveys (Cumming 1958:46). A report on this additional work at 14RY10, prepared by J. H. Kelley (1966), is available in manuscript. Kelley suggests that 14RY10 should be placed in the Central Plains tradition, but is not willing to be as specific as Cumming (1958) who aligned it with the Table Rock focus of the Nebraska aspect. Carl Miller directed a third season of River Basin Surveys archaeological salvage work in the Tuttle Creek Reservoir in 1962. The major excavation during this season was at the Pishny site (14MH2), tentatively assigned to the Central Plains tradition; it is interpreted as intermediate in content between the Nebraska complex to the east and the Upper Republican complex to the west (Kelley 1966:90). Several minor excava tions were also conducted by Miller's party in 1962 (Kelley 1966)/ 272</page><page sequence="3">The only other salvage excavations in the Tuttle Creek Reservoir were in 1957, by the field party from the University of Kansas. This group excavated or tested five sites in the northern part of the reservoir: 1. Bean Hollow (14MH1), a multi-component site with Archaic, Woodland, and Central Plains tradition occupations; 2. The Walls site (14MH42), a Central Plains tradition earth-lodge village; 3. The Eckdall site (14P01), a Woodland and Archaic site which also produced a Folsom point; 4. 14MH44, an Archaic site; and 5. The Budenbender site (14P04), an earthlodge village of the Central Plains tradition. The results of the major excavation in 1957, at the Budenbender site, are described in the present report. Subsequent reports are planned for other sites excavated or tested in 1957. SITE DESCRIPTION The Budenbender site, 14P04, is an earth lodge village on the north side of Spring Creek near its junction with Bluff Creek. Spring Creek, the larger of the two streams, flows from the rolling hill country southeast of the site, while Bluff Creek enters the area from the northeast. Both streams are spring-fed, and form a fairly permanent water course, especially below the point of juncture. North and south of the site, the land rises rapidly to high ridges which separate Spring Creek valley from others in both directions. East and west of the site, the valley is characterized by slight rises and shallow swales marking old channels of the creek and erosional remnants left during times of flood. The site is on a low, oval-shaped rise measur ing 500 feet east to west by 300 feet north to south. It had been plowed and was in corn at the time of excavation, which had eradicated any surface features which might once have been present. Additional damage to the site resulted from the construction of two roads; one, a well-maintained county road cutting the eastern end of the site, and the other a farm road cutting the western end. A drilled well was at the west end of the site, 12 feet west of House 1. The site is named for the landowner, Phillip Budenbender, who maintained a home on the slope north of the site. The legal description of the site is Pottawatomie County, T6S, R8E, Sec. 8, N1/2, SE%. It is 2.5 miles east of the mouth of Spring Creek, and some nine miles southwest of the village of Bigelow, Kansas. METHODS OF EXCAVATION An initial test, in the form of a 3-foot square, demonstrated the presence of an earthlodge at the west end of the site (Fig. 1). On the basis of this information, a grid system was established with magnetically oriented north-south and east west grid lines. A trench, 35 feet long and 5 feet wide, defined the north and south edges of the house. A second trench, excavated at right angles, delineated the edges of the house on the east and west. The remainder of the lodge was excavated by means of 5-foot squares within the grid system. The squares were linked together as trenches across the house, both on the east and west sides of the original north-south trench, and were carried beyond the edge of the house in all cases. In addition to these excavation units, irregular excavations, not conforming to the grid, were made on the north, west, and south sides of the house in an attempt to locate an entrance passage. The first trench across the lodge was dug in two arbitrary levels, one from the surface of the ground to 6 inches below surface and another from 6 inches below surface to the floor of the lodge. The remainder of the house was excavated in two levels; one the plow zone, and the other from the bottom of the plow zone to the floor. The plow zone to floor level included material from the roof of the house. An irregular excava tion south of the house was dug to a depth of 6 inches below floor level in an attempt to locate an entrance passage. After excavation of the initial cross trenches, it became apparent that natural stratigraphic levels could be followed in the remainder of the house. The uppermost level, from the surface of the ground to a depth of from 3 to 6 inches, included two soil lenses, similar in color and texture, which were labeled the plow zone. Both lenses were composed of light-gray top soil, but the bottom of the two was slightly darker and a bit harder. The second level, from the bottom of the plow zone to the floor of the house, or from about 6 to about 12 inches below the surface of the ground, consisted of roof material. Near the center of the house the level was dark-brown in color, and included numerous fragments of daub and charcoal. The dark color changed to light 273</page><page sequence="4">brown near the edges of the house. A light yellowish, clay subsoil underlay the house floor. DESCRIPTIONS OF FEATURES Feature 7: The central fireplace of House 1 was a basin-shaped pit, roughly circular in out line, 36 inches in diameter. It was filled to a depth of two inches with white ash and charcoal flecks. The ash was underlain and surrounded by earth burned to a bright-orange color. The west edge of the pit was disturbed by rodent activity. Contents: No artifacts. Feature 2: A cylindrical cache pit 48 inches in diameter and 25 inches in depth, in the floor of the house near the north edge. Contents: Rim sherds, body sherds, chipped stone, ground stone, unworked stone, identifiable shell, char coal, daub, red ochre. Feature 3: A bell-shaped cache pit in the floor on the north side of the lodge. The diameter at the mouth was 36 inches; at the neck, 34 inches; at the point of maximum diameter, 44 inches; and at the bottom, 36 inches. Contents: Rim sherds, body sherds, clay pipe fragment, chipped stone, ground stone, rough stone, unworked stone, identifiable and worked bone, identifiable shell, unbaked clay, charcoal, daub, red ochre. Feature 4: A basin-shaped pit measuring 23 inches, north-south, by 32 inches, east-west; and 11 inches in depth. Numerous rodent holes in its fill continued down into the underlying sub-soil. These may, in part, account for the somewhat irregular shape of the feature. Contents: rim sherds, body sherds, chipped stone, rough stone, identifiable bone, identifiable shell, charcoal, daub, red ochre. Feature 5: A basin-shaped pit near the east edge of the house. Dimensions: 35 inches, north-south, by 47 inches, east-west; it was 20 inches in depth. One of the major support posts of the house was set on a flat limestone slab in the west end of the pit. Contents: Body sherds, chipped stone, ground stone, rough stone, work ed bone, identifiable bone, identifiable shell, red ochre. Feature 6: House 1 (Fig. 1). HOUSES Indications of the former presence of three earthlodges were noted.

Surface refuse consisted of chert flakes and cores, except in two areas of concentration where there were small fragments of daub and sherds. Test pits in the area of concentrated refuse at the west end of the site located more daub, and also charcoal, suggesting the remains of an earthlodge. Consequently, further excava tions were made in this area. A third house may have been in the southern part of the site; in this section, over a roughly circular area approxi mately 25 feet in diameter, the corn was much shorter and browner than in the surrounding field. Time restricted excavation to the house at the west end of the site. House 1 (Fig. 1) Shape: Circular, with a mean diameter of 26 feet. The floor sloped from a depth of six inches below the surface of the ground at the edges to 12 inches below surface at the center. Entrance: A well-defined entrance passage extending beyond the edge of the house could not be found, but a complex of posts on the south side of the lodge may mark its location. The complex included two lines of three posts each: they were 5 to 9 inches in diameter, and 9 to 19 inches deep. The width of the complex at the house edge was 7 feet. Posts: Four post holes, marking the former location of the center supports, were on a radius 7 feet from the center of the house. They were oriented on northwest-southeast and northeast southwest lines, and were 10 to 13 inches in diameter and 18 to 21 inches deep. The 27 post holes marking the location of the outer supports ranged from 4 to 14 inches in diameter, and 3 to 16 inches deep. The outer supports fell on radii of from 12 feet 6 inches to 14 feet from the center of the house. They were spaced at intervals of from 6 inches to 8 feet. Apparently, the outer walls of the structure were vertical since all of the outer posts were set perpendicularly. A number of posts were irregu larly scattered about the floor of the house, which may have functioned as added supports for the roof, or as supports for interior furniture. Included in the fill of the post holes were fragments of daub, bone, charcoal, pottery, stone, ochre, and shell. Roof: Material from the roof was marked by a layer of extremely dark soil mixed with numer ous fragments of daub and charcoal near the center of the house. This dark layer became considerably lighter towards the edges of the house, and the fragments of daub and charcoal were less common. Grass and twig impressions were present on surfaces of the burned daub. Fireplace: The single fireplace, Feature 1, was in the center of the floor. Cache Pits: Two pits identified as caches were in the floor of the house. Feature 2 was cylindrical pit, and Feature 3 a bell-shaped cache. Both are in the north section of the lodge. Other Features: Two other pits, Features 4 and 5, were in the house floor. Their mouths were irregular in outline, and both had roughly basin-shaped cross sections. They were near the east side of the house. POTTERY A sample of 1,112 sherds was collected during investigations at Budenbender. Variations in sur face finish and temper allow the sample to be subdivided into two basic wares with several minor variations. One ware is characterized by sand temper and a cordmarked surface finish, while the other is tempered with shell and has a plain surface.

A majority (61.7%) of the rims from Budenbender corres pond in all respects to the ware Riley Cord roughened, established by Wedel (1959:183-4). Characteristics of this ware are vessels of small to medium size range with rounded shoulders, globular bodies, and rounded bases. The slightly flaring or collared rims have rounded lips. Tem per is usually sand, although clay and shell occur. Vessel surfaces are cordmarked. Decoration is rare, usually restricted to rims, and consists of simple geometric design elements. 275</page><page sequence="6">vB^r C ^^^^ d e f Figure 2. Sherds from Budenbender.

Riley Cord-roughened Flaring Rims (Fig. 2a-b). Most (27 or 79.4%) of the Riley Cord roughened rims from Budenbender are low, simple, flaring rims with rounded lips. At least 20 different vessels are represented. In many cases, cord-roughening extends from the shoulder to the lip, although an area at the junction of the rim and the shoulder is occasionally smoothed.

Interior surfaces are plain. Decorations are lack ing on any of the flaring rims. Three of the Riley Cord-roughened flaring rims bear plain strap handles which are welded to the lip and to the shoulder at its junction with the rim. Riley Cord-roughened Collared Rims (Fig. 2c). Seven, or 20.6%, of the Riley Cord roughened rims, probably representing seven different vessels, bear low collars which divide the rim exterior into upper and lower sections. In five cases, vertical cordmarks occur on both collars and lower rims; in one case vertical cordmarks are present on the lower rim and partially obliterated horizontal cordmarks on the collar; in a final instance, vertical cordmarks are present on the lower rim and the collar. Decora tions, present on two of the rims, consist of a series of identations, a result of pressing the end of a *inger into the clay at the base of the collar. Four rims retain lips, and in all cases these are rounded. Rim interiors, characterized by a shal low channel below the lip in five cases and a straight surface in two, are plain.

Plain Shell Tempered Jar Rims (Fig. 2d). Nine rims, from six jars, are characterized by plain surface finish and shell temper. Shell fragments, once present in abundance on sherd surfaces, have, for the most part, eroded away, and surfaces are now pitted with small flat irregular holes. None of the surfaces are polished, and none bear slips. All sherds in this category have low, slightly flaring rims and rounded lips. In four cases, rims are marked by a slight thickening at the lip, apparently a result of folding the lip over against itself to form a rolled rim. Three rims bear plain strap handles welded to the rim and shoulder. Handles are identical to those on Riley Cord roughened flared rims. Decoration is restricted to shoulder regions, and consists of incised lines in opposed diagonal 276</page><page sequence="7">patterns. Individual incised lines are sharp and distinct, with rectangular contours. Lines vary in width from 1 to 3 mm. The incised design, which encircles the vessel at the shoulder, does not have a distinct border line at either bottom or top.

Plain Shell Tempered Bowl Rims (Fig. 2f-g). A shell-tempered paste was used to produce occa sional bowls as well as jars, as indicated by the three rims in this category. Two are broken from small, hemispherical bowls with rounded lips. Surfaces are plain and smooth, although not polished. There is no evidence of an added slip. The third rim in this category is from a small, apparently straight-sided, bowl with a rounded lip. A vertically perforated lug is 10 mm. below the lip. Incised designs on the exterior include a single line just below the lip, and vertically placed zig-zag lines on the sides. Traces of a grayish-brown slip remain on the exterior sur face. The interior is roughly smoothed, but not slipped. The quantity of broken fragments of fresh water mussel shell tempering was less than in the case of most of the plain shell-tempered jars, and as a consequence the surfaces of the bowls are less pitted from the. erosion and subsequent disappearance of shell fragments than are the surfaces of the jars. The following metrical attributes pertain to the plain shell-tempered bowl sherds: lip thick ness, 2, 3 and 4 mm.; body thickness, 4, 5 and 7 mm.; orifice diameter, 5 and 9 cm.; lug height, 22 mm. Plain Sand Tempered Rims. The eight rims, apparently representing eight different vessels, grouped under this heading are similar in most respects to Riley Cord-roughened Flaring Rims but lack any traces of cordmarks. It is possible that some are smoothed rims of the type Riley Cord-roughened, although the presence of a sizeable number of plain body sherds (see below) suggests that a distinct plain, sand tempered type was produced by the potters at Budenbender village. Although all of the plain sand tempered rims are small fragments, they seem to be simple flaring rims with rounded lips. Decoration is present on two examples. In one case a series of finger presses occurs immediately below the lip on the rim exterior; on the other rim, small, pointed blobs of clay were pinched up from the rim exterior 18 mm. below the lip.

Cord-roughened Shell-tempered Rims (Fig. 2e). There are a number of cord-roughened and shell-tempered body sherds in the collection from the Budenbender site, but only two rims share these attributes. The rims are quite differ ent. One is broken from a small, rather thick walled vessel. The rim is slightly flaring and has a rounded lip. Vertical cordmarks extend from the rounded shoulder to the lip. Interior surfaces are smoothed. The rim is undecorated. Metrical attributes of this shell-tempered cord-roughened rim are: lip thickness, 3 mm.; lower rim thick ness, 6 mm.; shoulder thickness, 5 mm.; rim height, 7 mm.; orifice diameter, 9 cm. The rim just described is, in most respects, similar to Riley Cord-roughened rims from Budenbender. In this regard, it is interesting that Wedel (1959:183) notes the presence of shell as tempering in occasional Riley Cord-roughened sherds from the Griffing site, and apparently permits the inclusion of this variation in the ware. At Budenbender, however, the attribute of shell temper seems to indicate a significant variation in the pottery sample, and for that reason this shell-tempered cord-roughened rim is given a status separate from Riley Cord roughened. The second rim is similar in all respects, except for the presence of cord-roughening, to plain, shell-tempered rims at Budenbender. The 277</page><page sequence="8">slightly flaring rim is from a round-shouldered, globular jar, and has a slightly thickened lip. Cord-roughening, present on the body, ends in a plain-surfaced shoulder band decorated with a geometric pattern of opposed-diagonal incised lines. The cord-roughening is partially obliter ated. Metrical attributes: lip thickness, 5 mm.; shoulder thickness, 6 mm.; body thickness, 4 mm. BODY SHERDS Most of the body sherds from Budenbender are divisible into five categories based on differ ences in surface finish, temper, and presence or absence of decoration. The five categories, the number of sherds in each, and the percentage of the total 1041 so classified are summarized (Table 6). Various attributes of the sherds in each category are summarized in tables and discussions following.

It is estimated that not more than 14 vessels are represented in the collection of decorated shoulder sherds. As it is obvious that differential breakage has a marked effect on quantities of different styles of decor ated shoulder designs, an attempt has been made to group all of the sherds from a single vessel in the following descriptions. Numbers of vessels and types of designs are summarized (Table 9). It will be noted that there are apparently more vessels with parallel incised lines and single line designs than there are designs of other types. The figures for these two categor ies, however, may not be realistic as the sherds are small. A striking feature of the decorated shoulder collection is the large number of designs and the fact that they occur on only one or two vessels. Similar variation occurs in such features as presence or absence of slip, surface finish charac teristics, color, and texture (Table 9). The amount of variation can be interpreted to suggest that many of the decorated, plain surfaced, shell tempered sherds from Budenbender were not manufactured locally, but were traded into the site. Attention should be called to one unusual sherd which depicts two arrows. Points on the arrows are isosceles triangles formed by three incised lines; the arrow is formed of a single, straight incised line; and fleching is indicated by two lines which curve away from the arrow. MISCELLANEOUS CERAMIC ITEMS Plain Shell Tempered Effigy Vessel (Fig. 3). There are several restorable sherds of a small, 278</page><page sequence="9">TABLE 9 Decorated shoulder attributes Design Number of Slip Munsell color notation vessels Vertical zig-zag 1 Yes 10 YR 6/3 Pale Brown Horizontal zig-zag 2 One 10YR 7/3 Very pale brown 7.5 YR N5/0Gray Arrows 1 Yes 10YR 6/4 Light yellowish brown Parallel diagonal incised lines 1 No 7.5YR N5/0Gray Opposed diagonal incised lines 1 No 2.5YR N3/0 Very dark gray Curved lines 1 Yes 10YR 4/1 Dark gray Single straight lines 3 No 10YR 6/4 Light yellowish brown 10YR 5/3 Brown 10YR 3/1 Very dark gray Parallel incised lines 4 No 10YR 6/4 Light yellowish brown 10YR 5/2 Grayish brown 10YR 5/1 Gray 7.5 YR N4/0 Dark gray Total 14 anthropomorphic effigy bowl. Approximately one-half of a human face, with facial contours modeled in relief, remains on one side of the bowl. The nose is broken away, but part of the mouth and one eye remain to indicate they were produced by incising. The single remaining ear is a small, perforated clay tab added to the face. Other features of the vessel include a partially vertically-perforated lug on the side of the vessel behind the ear; an incised line which encircles the bowl slightly below the rounded lip; and a widening of the vessel at the broken base suggesting that a basal stand of some form was once present. The vessel is shell tempered, and was originally covered with a gray to buff colored slip. No traces of paint remain. The following are metrical attributes of the effigy head vessel: lip thickness, 3 mm.; body thickness, 6 mm.; total remaining height, 72 mm.; length of vertically-perforated lug, 32 mm.; orifice diameter, 400 mm. The effigy vessel from Budenbender bears certain similarities to the Type A, Sub-type 2 head vases established by Mills (1968:3). Accord ing to Mills (1968:1) the center of the distribu tion of effigy head vessels seems to have been on the west side of the Mississippi River in south eastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas. Pre sumably, the presence of an effigy head vessel at Budenbender can be attributed to trade, and in this respect it is interesting to note that Mills recognizes a secondary cluster of effigy head vessels along the Arkansas River in central Arkansas. This extension of the distribution of the vessel form brings it in somewhat closer proximity to the Central Plains. Miniatures. One complete and seven fragments of miniature pottery vessels are present. The complete vessel is a crudely-modeled hemispheri cal bowl. The lip has been flaked away; temper seems to be sand, although there is little of it. The exterior surface is marked by shallow pits, probably finger impressions left by the direct modeling process used to manufacture it. Six rim sherds are also from miniature bowls.

Four are tempered with sand and two with shell. Apparently all were directly modeled, and several bear finger impressions on exterior surfaces. One of the bowls has a rim set off by a slight constriction. The remaining sherd is from the body of a vessel lacking a rim. The fragment is sand tempered, and may have been broken from a hemispherical bowl. Thick-walled Vessels. Fragments, including four rims and two body sherds from at least four vessels, have extremely thick vessel walls. Two of the vessels are bowls, while the third has a slight constriction at the rim and may have been a jar. All are crudely-modeled with exterior surfaces marred by finger impressions and scraping marks. Two of the sherds are shell tempered, while the others are sand tempered. Tempering is sparse in all cases. The thick-walled vessel sherds resemble the miniature vessels in form, general lack of refinement, and sparcity of temper.

One complete and two fragmentary strap handles, no longer fastened to rim sections, are present. All are plain and grit tempered. Two larger fragments taper slightly from the point where they were welded to the lips of rims to the point where they were fastened to shoulders. The smaller fragment is encircled by a lip of clay at the point where the handle broke loose from the shoulder.

CHIPPED STONE ARTIFACTS Descriptions in this section are of chert artifacts produced by either hard or soft hammer percussion techniques and occasionally finished by pressure flaking. Items range from fine, bifacially-flaked projectile points to simple utiliz ed flakes. Sub-divisions are based primarily on morphological differences. In many cases, a function is suggested by the shared morphologi cal attributes of a group of artifacts, but in almost every case this imputed function remains to be tested. With only rare exceptions, the occupants of the Budenbender site selected a local variety of Flint Hills chert for the manufacture of chipped stone artifacts. The chert is banded, generally gray in color (see Munsell color designations in Tables 21 and 25), and contains tiny white fossil inclusions. Cores. Number: 42 Description: The local variety of chert occurs in three different forms, and selections were made from all for modification into cores. One of the forms, and the one most frequently selected, consists of tabular layers interbedded with limestone. Judging from the thickness of core nuclei, the chert layers seem to range from about 50 to 75 mm. thick. Chert was also obtained in nodular form, each nodule encased in a limestone cortex; and as water-worn cobbles from local stream deposits. Core nuclei demonstrate that three distinct types of cores were used to produce flakes. The most common nucleus, represented by ^exam ples, is rectangular with either one or two striking platforms. These rectangular cores, which would have produced either parallel or expanding flakes, were made from tabular chert deposits. A second type of core nucleus is oval in outline, a result of removing expanding flakes from both faces and from all edges, which served as striking platforms. This core type, represented by 10 examples, could have been produced from tabular layers of chert, from water-worn cobbles, or from nodules of chert. The final core type, represented by five nuclei, is pyramidal in shape, a result of unifacially removing parallel or ex panding flakes from the perimeter of the striking platform. An hydration layer on the surface of 281</page><page sequence="12">one of the nuclei in this group indicates that water-worn cobbles were occasionally used for this type of core. Eleven fragments of cores constitute the remainder of the collection.

Unretouched Flakes. Number 256 Description: Quantities and percentage distri butions of various categories of waste flakes are summarized (Table 14). Included are primary decortication flakes (initial flakes removed in the process of preparing a core) and four groups of flakes which vary in gross morphology. Expand ing flakes have lateral edges which expand outward from the striking platform; contracting flakes have lateral margins which come together; and parallel flakes have parallel lateral edges. Irregular flakes include a high percentage of broken flakes.

There are no primary decortication flakes in the retouched flake category, for instance. Also, while contract ing flakes constitute 17.2% of the waste flakes they are represented in the retouched flakes by only 2.9%. Finally, the fact that the percentages of expanding and parallel unretouched flakes are significantly lower than for the same types of retouched flakes suggests a non-random selection of these types of flakes for the manufacture of tools.

Unnotched Projectile Points (Fig. 4a-b). Number: 8 complete; 16 fragments Description: Artifacts grouped together under this heading are triangular in outline, with straight or slightly convex lateral edges. Bases are nearly straight, although they may be either slightly concave or convex. All points were manufactured from small flakes, and all are bifacially retouched, although in some instances the retouching is only marginal on one or both faces. All are made from chert which, with one exception, is a local variety of Flint Hills chert. The exception is a fine-grained, homogeneous black chert. 282</page><page sequence="13">1; 11 Sip" a c d Figure 4.

Notched Projectile Points (Fig. 4c).

In addition, three have a single pair of side notches, one has a double pair of side notches, and one has a single pair of side notches and a basal notch. The fragmentary specimens are broken across pairs of side notches, and the number of notches cannot be determined.

Projectile Point fragments. Number: 11 Description: This category includes the tips of small, bifacially retouched artifacts, all of which are similar in form and size to the tips of unbroken projectile points. Retouching occurs across the entire face of the objects, or is restricted to lateral edges. All are manufactured from local gray or pink chert. Perforating Tools (Fig. 5a). Number: 5 complete; 11 fragments Description: Chipped stone perforators have an irregularly-shaped but expanding base, and a bit with an oval or circular cross section which tapers from the base to a rounded lip. Steep bifacial retouching characterizes the bits, whereas the expanded bases are marked by a few primary flaking scars with only limited bifacial retouch. All perforators are of local chert.

Thin Triangular-Ovate Bifaces (Fig. 4c/). Num ber: 9 complete; 9 fragments Description: The small bifacially-retouched artifacts in this category range from triangular to ovate in outline. Bases are straight or convex and lateral edges are convex. Bifacial flaking scars extend across the entire face of the artifact, or are restricted to lateral edges. All are of local chert. Thin Asymmetrical Bifaces (Fig. bb-c). Number: 18 complete Description: A group of bifacially flaked tools share the formal attributes of one straight lateral edge and one curved lateral edge. Proximal and distal ends are either rounded or taper to a sharp 283</page><page sequence="14">tip. Bifacial flaking scars occur over the entire face of the tool, or are restricted to marginal borders. Several tools have a thickened area of unreduced stone near one lateral edge. In six examples, the straight lateral edge was blunted by crushing or grinding; a similar blunting occurs along the curved lateral edge of six other tools. This lateral edge blunting suggests that the opposite, long, lateral edge was the primary functional surface of the tool. With three excep tions, the asymmetrical bifaces are of local chert. The exceptions are of brown chert, and in all cases retain a hydrated cortex suggesting they were made from stream pebbles. Thin Rectangular Bifaces (Fig. 5d). Number: 2, complete Description: The distinctive, thin bifaces in this category have relatively straight lateral edges and ends, resulting in a rectangular outline. Faces of both specimens are characterized by large, expanding flake scars suggesting the objects were manufactured by percussion. One specimen is marked by a dark stain, apparently a result of burning, which extends from a lateral edge nearly to the mid-line of the biface. This stain suggests the tool was inserted in a slit in a bone or wooden haft, subsequently destroyed by fire. If this is the case, the long lateral edges would be primary use surfaces, and the objects are identifi able as knife blades. Thin Chisel-Edged Bifaces (Fig. 4e). Number: 11 complete; 2 fragments Description: The bifacially flaked tools in this category are triangular in outline with convex lateral edges. With one exception, all are bifacial ly retouched, although the retouching in several cases is marginal. The exception is unifacially and marginally retouched, but is included in the category as it shares with the other objects a steeply retouched, chisel-like distal edge. Crush ing and blunting of this chisel edge indicates that this was the primary use surface. Traces of crushing, grinding, and blunting are also present along the lateral edges of several tools., suggesting that they were hafted by inserting the proximal pointed tip and the lower two-thirds of the objects into wooden or bone handles. Constricted Biface. Number: 1 complete Description: This small, thin bifacially-flaked tool is generally rectangular in outline with convex ends.

Evidences of wear are not obvious, although small flake scars on one end and along one of the lateral concavities may have resulted from use. The tool is of a local variety of Flint Hills chert. Dimensions: length, 70 mm.; width, 41 mm.; thickness, 12 mm. Thin Biface Fragments. Number: 75 Description: Fragments of tips, midsections, and bases of thin, bifacially flaked stone tools. For the most part, flake scars extend entirely across both faces, although some are only mar ginally bifacially retouched. Flake scars are large and expanding, indicating they were produced by percussion. Larger fragments suggest that most were broken from tools similar to bifaces describ ed above. Only one of the fragments shows obvious evidence of use after breakage. In this case, curved, spokeshave-like areas have been steeply retouched into two edges. All fragments are manufactured from local varieties of Flint Hills chert. Thick Bifaces (Fig. 6e). Number: 8 complete Description: Thick bifaces have somewhat varying attributes, although all share a thickness greater than 17 mm. and are bifacially flaked. Flake scars may extend across the entire face of the tool or may be marginal. The scars are large and expanding, probably produced by percus sion. Flakes were removed by an alternate procedure which resulted in sinuous lateral mar gins. All of the thick bifaces are manufactured from local Flint Hills chert. A sub-group of five thick bifaces, with oval to rectangular outlines, includes two examples with traces of battering at one slightly wider end. The battering suggests that this was the primary functional surface, and that the objects were used for heavy chopping. Another sub-group, with a single representative, is triangular in outline, with a chisel-shaped working edge which is extensively battered; perhaps it functioned as a gouge or adze. Sub-group three includes a heavy chopping-like tool with one bifacially flaked edge as the primary functional surface. The opposite edge retains a portion of the striking platform of the core from which the flake was removed, and may have served as a hand-hold for the chopper. The final thick biface is a rectangular object, with traces of cortex at each end and with a single bifacially flaked edge. Battering along this edge suggests a function as a chopping tool. Thick Biface Fragments. Number: 23 Description: These are basal, mid-section, and tip fragments from thick bifacially chipped tools. Flake scars are large and expanding, suggesting they were produced by percussion. In some cases the flake scars extend entirely across the faces of the artifacts, while in others the flaking is marginal. Larger fragments suggest that rectangu lar or oval outlines were most common for unbroken examples of thick bifaces. All frag ments are manufactured from local Flint Hills chert.

The con cavities would have functioned efficiently as small spokeshaves to trim curved edges of bone or wooden tools. Four spokeshaves are on d Figure 6.

The final example includes two steeply retouch ed concavities, one in the end and one in the side of a rectangular flake resembling a blade. All of the spokeshaves are manufactured from local Flint Hills chert. Small End Scrapers (Fig. 6a-b). Number: 33 complete; 31 fragments Description: Small scraping tools made on expanding flakes have lateral edges, distal ends, and occasionally proximal ends with steep, mar ginal unifacial retouch. Evidences of use, in the form of polishing and small irregular flake removal, are concentrated at the curved distal ends. Additional traces of wear occasionally occur along one lateral margin, suggesting a secondary functional area. Excepting one scraper of translucent pink chert, and another of highly fossiliferous gray chert, all seem to have been manufactured from local Flint Hills chert. Wedel (1970:36-45) has described hafted end scrapers from later time periods in the Central Plains, and notes that traces of the hafting often occur on the faces and on both lateral margins in the form of polished and randomly chipped surfaces. No detailed study has been accomplish ed, but the absence of any obvious evidence of the type of wear described by Wedel suggests they may not have been hafted. It is worth noting in this context that end scrapers from the Great Bend aspect sites which Wedel described are generally smaller than those from Buden bender. The Budenbender scrapers could easily have been held between the fingers; those from Great Bend sites are much smaller and would be difficult to hand hold. Large End Scrapers (Fig. 6c-d). Number: 6 complete; 8 fragments Description: With one exception, the tools in this category are manufactured on large expand ing flakes. The exception is a water-worn cobble of chert. All of the large end scrapers have steep marginal retouch on distal ends, lateral edges, and occasionally on proximal ends. Flaking is generally unifacial, although infrequent examples are bifacially flaked. Traces of use are present on distal ends and lateral edges. In contrast to the small end scrapers, which exhibit wear in the form of polishing and small flake removal, use surfaces on large end scrapers are crushed, blunted, or rough and irregular, apparently a result of removing random flakes during use.

Number: 2 complete, 1 fragment ary Description: Although only three artifacts are classified as side scrapers, it should be noted that 286</page><page sequence="17">many of the objects in the retouched flake group are often identified as side scrapers. A division has been made here between the three steeply retouched artifacts with long scraping edges described here, and numerous irregularly-shaped flakes with steep retouch of limited extent which are commonly identified as retouched flakes. Two of the side scrapers are bifacially flaked, although steep marginal retouch is restricted to one face. The third scraper, a small broken section, is unifacially flaked. The scraping edges of two of the artifacts are rough and irregular, suggesting use against harder materials such as wood or bone, while the scraping edges of the third are more even and exhibit only the removal of tiny flakes. Dimensions of complete speci mens: length, 60 and 84 mm.; width, 23 and 38 mm.: thickness, 8 and 14 mm. Retouched Flakes. Number: 252 Description: The flakes under this heading have been subdivided into four categories on the basis of gross morphology. Included are flakes with parallel lateral edges; flakes with lateral edges that expand from the striking platform; flakes with lateral edges that contract from the striking platform; and irregularly-shaped flakes. Many of the latter are broken fragments. All flakes bear varying amounts of marginal retouch, usually unifacial, although occasionally bifacial. Retouch can be either steep or shallow. Presum ably the retouched flakes, which could have been used for a variety of cutting and scraping purposes, were produced quickly when need arose. Local Flint Hills chert was used for their manufacture. Quantities of retouched flakes, by category, are summarized (Table 22). Dimensions are summarized in Tables 23 and 24.

Number: 3 fragments Description: Metates are represented by three sections, two edge fragments and one center section. Two are manufactured from sandstone and one is of quartzite. All sections are thin, and are probably from metates which were nearly worn out before breakage. The largest section suggests an overall oval outline, with a shallow grinding basin. Linear striations in the grinding basin indicate a back-and-forth movement of the handstone. A slight dimpling effect is also notice able in the grinding basins of the metate frag ments, suggesting that they were occasionally roughened by hammering to produce a better grinding surface. Dimensions: length, 74-179 mm.; width, 51-113 mm.; thickness, 22-43 mm. Grinding stones (Fig. la). Number: 5 complete; 5 fragments Description: With one exception, the objects in this group are water-worn cobbles with modifi cation in the form of traces of grinding on the faces. The exception has similar traces of grind ing, but differs in that it is a flat slab of limestone. The evidences of grinding, which include striations and shallow concavities, occur on both faces of two specimens and on a single face of five others. The remaining three are fragments. Although their function is not appar ent from their size, their shape, or the traces of grinding, it is assumed that they were used in situations where a small grinding or mixing surface was required. Hammer and Grinding Stones (Fig. lb). Number: 5 complete Description: A group of water-worn cobbles, primarily of quartzite, have traces of modifica tion in the form of pecking on the edges and ends, and grinding on the faces. The edge and end pecking is presumably due to the use of these objects as hammerstones. That all were also used for grinding is indicated by shallow grinding basins and striations on at least one face. In the case of four, the grinding is restricted to a single face, while the fifth has shallow grinding basins in both faces. The grinding area of one tool is covered with traces of red ochre, indicating that grinding hematite into paint was one function of these objects. a b Figure 8. Ground stone artifacts from Budenbender. a, pipe fragment; b-c, grooved abraders. Length of c, 73 mm. Grooved Abraders (Fig. 8b-c). Number: 3 com plete; 12 fragments Description: These abraders, manufactured from sandstone, are generally oval to rectangular in outline and cross section, with deep longitud inal grooves on one or more faces. Three types of grooves are in evidence and occur in varying combinations on multiple grooved abraders: 1. Narrow, shallow straight grooves extending to each end of the artifact. The form of the grooves suggest that the objects may have been used to smooth arrowshafts. 2. V-shaped grooves, often slightly curved, which usually do not extend to the ends of the artifact. This type of groove may have resulted from sharpening the point of an object such as an awl. 3. Irregular, broad and deep depressions, usually slightly longer than wide. Abrading Stones. Number: 3 complete Description: Three small tools manufactured from abrasive materials have traces of grinding on 289</page><page sequence="20">one or more surfaces. Two of the abrading stones are water-worn cobbles of quartzite. In the case of one of the quartzite abrading stones, traces of grinding are restricted to the faces. Linear stria tions, parallel to the long axis of the tool, are present on both faces. The second quartzite abrading stone bears small ground facets at various points on ends, edges, and faces. The final abrading stone, a conglomerate, has no obvious wear patterns, but has traces of red ochre on one face. Presumably these small tools were used for a variety of miscellaneous abrading purposes. Dimensions: length, 50 to 79 mm.; width, 41 to 49 mm.; thickness, 26 to 42 mm. Ground Stone Fragments. Number: 10 Description: These small fragments, with traces of grinding on one or more surfaces, seem to have been broken from artifacts similar to those described above. Materials are sandstone, quartzite, and a fine-grained reddish stone similar in appearance to catlinite. Hematite. Number: 17 Description: Small fragments of soft red hematite with grinding facets and striations. Apparently hematite was ground into a powder on the grinding stones described above, and then probably mixed with a medium to form red paint. Hammerstones. Number: 22 complete, 1 frag ment Description: A group of water-worn cobbles, primarily of quartzite, have traces of use as hammers in the form of restricted areas of pecking on the edges and ends. It is assumed that hammerstones were among the primary tools used to produce chipped stone artifacts, and that they had in addition many other functions wherever a light hammer was needed. Pitted Hammerstones. Number: 2 complete Description: Water-worn cobbles have traces of pecking about their edges and ends, presum ably a result of their use as hammers, and small pits pecked and ground into both faces. One of the objects has two shallow pits in each face, while the other has only a single pit in each face. The pits perhaps functioned as aids in holding the hammers, and may also have been used for miscellaneous grinding purposes. Dimensions: length, 64 and 82 mm.; width, 58 and 78 mm.; thickness, 39 and 57 mm.

ARTIFACTS OF BONE AND ANTLER Awl. Number: 1 fragment Description: The sharply pointed tip of a bone awl. The fragment is plano-convex in cross section and is highly polished. Dimensions: width, 4 mm. Fishhooks. Number: 1 complete, 1 fragment. Description: The complete fishhook is J-shap ed, with the shank approximately twice as long as the barb. The tip of the barb is sharpened. A shallow groove encircles the upper portion of the shank, undoubtedly for the attachment of a line. The fragmentary fishhook was apparently broken during manufacture. The remaining sec tion suggests that the hook was being cut from a flat, oval section of bone by first drilling a conical hole in one corner and then cutting away the interior portion of the bone section. Prob ably two hooks were produced as a result of this process. Dimensions: length of complete hook, 31 mm.; length of broken hook, 71 mm. 290</page><page sequence="21">Bead. Number: 1 complete Description: A short bead was made from a bird lone bone by cutting an encircling groove nearly through the bone and then breaking the segment away. The exterior surface is polished, and the ends slightly worn, perhaps as a result of abrasion against other beads in a string. Dimen sions: length, 14 mm.; diameter 8 mm. Antler Shaft Straightener. Number: 1 complete Description: The single shaft straightener is a section of antler retaining two tines. A biconical perforation occurs near the junction of the tines, and a V-shaped groove extends from the upper edge of the perforation on one face to the upper edge on the opposite face. The end of one tine is flat and polished, while the other is beveled and polished. Dimensions: length, 228 mm.; width of antler below tine juncture, 28 mm.; diameter of perforation, 10 mm. Antler Handle. Number: 1 complete Description: A section of antle.r from immedi ately above the point of attachment to the skull has a perforation 11 mm. deep in one end. The slightly curved section, which perhaps functioned as a handle for an implement such as an awl, is somewhat polished. Dimensions: length, 112 mm.; diameter, 26 mm. Worked Antler. Number: 1 complete Description: A short section of antler has one rounded and slightly polished end, and one end which bears traces of an encircling groove cut to remove the section from a larger antler segment. Dimensions: length, 20 mm.; diameter, 16 mm. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The Budenbender site (14P04) was a small prehistoric village, which originally included from two to three earthlodges and related extra mural features, situated on a terrace above Spring Creek, a tributary of the Big Blue River, in northeastern Kansas. In 1957, investigations were conducted there by a field party from the University of Kansas, under contract to the National Park Service, as one facet of the Inter-Agency Archeological Salvage Program in the Tuttle Creek Reservoir. The 1957 investiga tions were restricted to the excavation of a single earthlodge (House 1), which was completely cleared. House 1 had a roughly circular pattern of exterior support posts, four central support posts, a central fireplace, and two interior storage pits near the north edge of the house. Two somewhat irregular pits were near the east edge of the house. Although a well-marked entrance passage was not discovered, a complex of posts near the south edge of the house probably marks the former location of such a passage. House 1 was approximately 25 feet in diameter and included about 490 square feet of floor space. A large sample of artifacts was retrieved from House 1. Included are sherds from pottery vessels representing at least two wares, one sand tempered and cord marked, the other shell tempered and plain surfaced. Stone and bone tools point to an economy based on hunting, gathering, and agriculture. Chipped stone tools and debitage from the manufacture of such tools occur in quantity, probably a result of the abundance of local gray Flint Hills chert. A single radiocarbon determination, on char coal from a post in House 1, is 760 ? 150 (M-869) or A.D. 1190. Comparisons of this date and the features and artifacts from Budenbender with previously excavated materials from Kansas and Nebraska leave no doubt that the site should be assigned to the Central Plains tradition (Krause 1969:94-5). INTRA-SITE PATTERNS Studies of the spatial relationships of artifacts and features within the Budenbender earthlodge resulted in the development of a series of hypotheses about patterns of social interaction at the site. The following discussion should be prefaced by the statement that House 1 is assumed to have been occupied only once, and for a relatively short period of time. The assump tion of a single component occupation receives support from the high degree of homogeneity evidenced by the artifact assemblage. House 1 is approximately 25 feet in diameter and includes roughly 490 square feet or 53 square meters of floor space. Formulae for determining population size from the amount of available floor space have been proposed by Naroll (1962:587-9) and by Cook and Heizer (1968:79-116). Naroll (1962:587-9), on the basis of a cross-cultural study of 18 ethnographically known societies suggests "that the population of a prehistoric settlement can be very roughly estimated by archaeologists as of the order of one-tenth of the floor area in square meters occupied by its dwellings." In the case of the 291</page><page sequence="22">Budenbender house, then, a population of five is indicated. Cook and Heizer (1968:114), using data from aboriginal California, suggest that about 20 square feet per person is likely, although when groups larger than six are involv ed, there is an increase of 100 square feet per person, "such that as the mean number of occupants increased, the floor space per person approached a limit of 100 square feet." Using these figures, the 490 square feet of the Buden bender house could have accommodated 10 persons. The estimates that the Budenbender house was occupied by a group of between five and ten persons seem reasonable, especially considering the fact that portions of the total floor space were occupied by features such as storage pits, the fireplace, and posts (some of which may have supported furniture). Combining the evidence of population size with other data from the site, it can be suggested that the five to ten individuals who occupied the house constituted the members of a single nuclear family. A family group occupation is supported by the artifact sample, which includes tools assumed to be related to both male (projectile points and a shaft straightener) and female (pottery) tasks. The presence of children is suggested by miniature and crudely-made pottery vessels, perhaps the results of learning experiences. Additional support for the idea that the house was occupied by a family comes from the high degree of homogeneity of the artifact collection, which suggests learned processes of manufacture within a small social unit. It was hypothesized that differential activity areas, related to a division of labor by sex, could be recognized in the Budenbender house. To test this hypothesis, distributions of artifacts on the floor or in close proximity to the floor were plotted on a series of maps of the house. From the plots of the distributions of all artifacts in floor association, two patterns of differential distribution could be recognized. One pattern appeared in relation to pottery. Of 98 plain, shell-tempered sherds on or near the floor of the house, 86% occurred in the north half of the house (north of the fireplace), while only 14% were found in the south half. A similar pattern held for the 198 cordmarked, sand-tempered sherds: 73% were in the north half of the house, while only 27% occurred in the south half. On the basis of this differential distribution of pottery, and assuming that pottery was more often associated with female activities than with male, it can be inferred that the northern half of the house was primarily relegated to female concerns. Support for this inference comes from the presence of two storage pits in the north half of the house, presumably used primarily by females for storing foodstuffs. The only other artifact category with a non-random distribution in the house is, interest ingly, a category most probably associated with male activities. The category includes a variety of projectile point styles, seemingly related to hunt ing and warfare. Although only eight projectile points were in floor association, 75% were in the south half of the house, while the other 25% occurred in the north half. The small sample size negates absolute statements, but the data are indicative of a southern male activity area. This indication is, of course, reinforced by the data abuve which support a northern female activity area. Other artifacts in floor association occur randomly, suggesting that most tools produced by the occupants were for use by males and females. Perhaps detailed studies of specific functions of these tools will, in the future, permit a refinement of this statement. Additional refinements of possible intra-mural activity areas should also be forthcoming as a result of more specific data on artifact distributions. The Budenbender house was excavated in a grid of five foot squares, so floor-associated artifacts can be placed no more precisely than within a 25 square foot area. The suggestions of activity areas, produced by the analysis of data from an excavation with controls no more precise than this, point to the potential of the approach. It can undoubtedly be refined by plotting exactly the position of each artifact on the floor of a house. Although the above statements about activity areas were phrased in terms of northern and southern areas, it is probable that relationship to position of the entrance passage is more signifi cant. The probable location of the entrance passage was the south wall of the house. The hypothesized male activity area would, then, have been in close proximity to the door, while the female activity area was opposite the door. Wood (1969a:6-10) has described a Classic Re publican phase house from southwestern Nebraska with the entrance passage in the east wall of the house. Storage pits occur there in the west half of the house, suggesting a female 292</page><page sequence="23">activity area opposite the door, as in the case of Budenbender. A summary of Central Plains tradition house characteristics (Wood 1952) indi cates a wide variety of entrance passage orienta tions. It would be instructive to examine pit locations in relation to these various directions in a search for patterns. A final consideration, relative to intra-site patterns of social interaction, is that of residence pattern. Wood (1969b: 106-7) has inferred a matrilocal pattern for the Central Plains tradition based on archaeological evidence as well as ethnographic analogy. The archaeological evi dence is drawn primarily from Deetz' (1965) study of pottery from the protohistoric Pawnee Burkett site. Deetz found a high degree of attribute similarity in his analysis of the Burkett pottery, and attributed this to the enculturation of female potters within a matrilocal residence pattern. As the Pawnee are among the putative descendents of groups that produced the Central Plains tradition, Wood suggests a matrilocal pattern for the prehistoric tradition. Additional support for this inference is based on an exten sion into the past of a matrilocal residence pattern observed among other groups assumed to be descendents of the Central Plains tradition (Wood 1969b: 106-7). Although Wood's inference may hold for the historic and protohistoric periods, data from Budenbender suggest the possibility of a differ ent residence pattern for the prehistoric period. The Budenbender house produced two distinct ceramic wares: one is plain and shell-tempered, the other is cordmarked and grit-tempered. The grit-tempered ware exhibits a high degree of internal attribute similarity, while the shell tempered ware is quite variable. The two wares are clearly distinct. At least two explanations of this situation are possible. First, the plain surfaced, shell-tempered, pottery from Buden bender, which occurs less frequently and exhibits more internal variability than the cordmarked, sand-tempered ware, could represent trade from an outside source. This interpretation can be questioned, however, since nearly 25% of the pottery is of this ware ? a large quantity to have been obtained by trade. Also, there is little evidence of outside contact and trade in other items of material culture: most were seemingly produced from local materials. A second possible explanation is that the two distinct pottery wares represent the productions of two women who developed ceramic skills in differing enculturation situations. If this interpre tation is correct, then a residence pattern other than matrilocality is implied for the prehistoric Central Plains tradition. While data are not currently available for a test, possibilities include patrilocality or neolocality, perhaps combined with a marriage system that permitted polygyny. INTER-SITE COMPARISONS Although the circular outline of the Buden bender house is unusual, other features, including the central hearth, four central support posts, interior storage pits, and an earth cover, align it with other structural manifestations of the Cen tral Plains tradition. Another feature relating the Budenbender house to the Central Plains tradi tion is the figure of 490 square feet of floor space. A summary of Central Plains tradition houses (Wood 1952:5-18) includes dimensions of 43 houses, which have been used to calculate the number of square feet of floor space within the houses. In addition, the number of square feet in 11 other houses has been determined by consult ing more recent literature (Brown 1967; Witty 1962, 1963; Wedel 1959; Wood 1969a). These data are summarized in Fig. 9, a histogram which shows the percentage distribution of a total of 54 Central Plains houses by intervals of 100 square feet. It is obvious that most Central Plains tradition houses have between 100 and 1700 square feet of floor space. It is also obvious that the percentage occurrences of the various house sizes form a bi-modal curve, with one group ranging from 100 to 700 square feet and the other from 900 to 1700 square feet. The curves overlap in only a single house (Mowry Bluff; Wood 1969) which falls between 700 and 800 square feet in size. Also evident from the histogram are two much larger houses, one of which has between 2500 and 2600 square feet of floor space and another which has between 3000 and 3100 square feet. These variations in number of square feet of floor space in Central Plains tradition houses permit the formulation of several hypotheses. First, in relation to the bi-modal curve of house size, it should be recognized that the same pattern pertains throughout the Central Plains sub-area, and that each regional variant (Upper Republican, Nebraska, and Smoky Hill) exhibits the pattern. This, in turn, suggests that the factor responsible for the bi-modal curve is an impor 293</page><page sequence="24">tant one throughout the Central Plains. Although this factor cannot be positively identified at this time, a suggestion can be made. Krause, in a summary of archaeological re search along the Solomon River valley of north central Kansas (1969:88-90), noted significant contrasts in local Central Plains tradition mani festations. These contrasts form the basis for an earlier Solomon River phase and a later Classic Republican phase. Both are in the Glen Elder locality of the Upper Republican regional variant of the Central Plains tradition. The Solomon River phase community is iden tified as a hamlet consisting of from six to ten large earthlodges. Subsistence, based on hunting, gathering, and agriculture, seems to have been more than adequate, as the lodges included large and deep storage pits for surpluses, and items of material culture were frequent and varied. Radio carbon dates suggest a temporal placement be tween A.D. 800 and 1200 for the Solomon River phase. The Classic Republican phase community consisted of from three to four more widely dispersed households. Houses are smaller and less substantially constructed. Also appearing as con stituents of the Classic Republican settlement pattern are seasonal hunting and fishing camps. The temporal placement is less firm, but seems to fall roughly between A.D. 1000 and 1400. The differences in sizes of houses between the Solomon River and the Classic Republican phases in the Glen Elder locality seem to parallel the differences noted in the broader comparison summarized in Figure 9. Other points of contrast between the two phases, including differences in time and subsistence patterns, combine to sug gest a possible explanation for the contrasts. Recent paleoecological research strongly sug gests the onset of a significant drought at about A.D. 1200 (Bryson, Baerreis, and Wendland 1968). The date of 1200 is, of course, the same as suggested by Krause (1969:89) for the end of the Solomon River phase. Perhaps, then, signifi cant contrasts between the Solomon River phase and the Classic Republican phase can be related to this climatic shift, and by extension perhaps the bi-modal distribution of house sizes noted for the Central Plains tradition in general is related to this shift. The drought period beginning at approximately A.D. 1200 has received its most adequate documentation to date from analyses of Mill Creek sites in northwestern Iowa (Bryson and Baerreis 1968:1-34). On the Plains, west of Iowa, farming probably became quite marginal 15 = io E E _ E ^ o ? ? ? ? / k EzEE ^ n n o o o o o o O O O o o o ? m o m m o ? ? C\J fr, SQUARE FEET Figure 9. Histogram of percentage distribution of Central Plains tradition houses, by intervals of 100 square feet. (Bryson, Baerreis, and Wendland 1968). In summary, it is suggested that the change from the Solomon River to the Classic Republi can phase is at least in part a result of the onset of drought conditions beginning around A.D. 1200. Prior to the drought, during the Solomon River phase, Central Plains tradition peoples occupied hamlets of large substantial houses. Following the onset of the drought, during the Classic Republican phase, the population dis persed in small households. The bi-modal distri bution of house sizes indicates that similar changes took place throughout the Central Plains. The Budenbender house, with a floor space of 490 square feet, falls within the segment of the bi-modal curve including smaller houses. This suggests a date in the later portion of the Central Plains tradition, A.D. 1200 or later. Support is forthcoming from the single radiocar bon date for the Budenbender house of A.D. 1190 ^ 150. Notable in Figure 9 are two houses which fall completely outside the bi-modal curve in terms of number of square feet of floor space. One of them, with between 2500 and 2600 square feet, is at a site near Minneapolis, Kansas (Wedel, 1935:220-1) of the Smoky Hill regional variant. The other, with between 2900 and 3000 square feet of floor space, is a Nebraska regional variant 294</page><page sequence="25">house at the Sheldon site (Bell and Gilmore 1936:309). The occasional extra large houses in the Central Plains tradition brings to mind similar structures among such historically known cultur al complexes as the Arikara (Bradbury 1817:165-6). The Arikara are believed, in part, to be descendents of the Central Plains tradition. For the Arikara, such large houses had special ized connotations within the belief system, and undoubtedly functioned as important integrating devices. Similar functions perhaps also obtained for the prehistoric structures noted here. Figure 10 is a cumulative graph comparing percentage occurrences of various types of chip ped stone artifacts from Budenbender, with a Classic Republican phase site (Mowry Bluff), and a Doniphan phase site (Nuzum) from the Lower Nemaha locality of the Nebraska regional variant of the Central Plains tradition (Wood 1969c:110). Data from the Classic Republican and Doniphan phase components are from Klippel (1969; Tables 22 and 23).

Klippel's, although are modified slightly to ac count for certain differences in the Budenbender material. The graph brings out interesting points of similarity and difference between the chipped stone industries of these three Central Plains tradition components. A similar relative fre quency of occurrence of projectile points at Nuzum (northeastern Kansas) and Budenbender (north-central Kansas) could be interpreted to indicate a similar emphasis on hunting in these two areas of the Plains. Reference to Table 29, however, suggests this statement should be con sidered with caution, as the projectile point sample from Nuzum is small. As noted below, there is other evidence that suggests Buden bender is more like Mowry Bluff than Nuzum in terms of emphasis on hunting as a subsistence activity. The more frequent occurrence of projec tile points at Mowry Bluff (southwestern Nebraska) than at either Nuzum or Budenbender is perhaps a reflection of a heavier emphasis on hunting in this more westerly, and perhaps more marginal agricultural region. Chipped stone bifaces and end scrapers occur in similar relative frequencies at both Buden bender and Mowry Bluff. It is probable that both of these tool categories were, at least in part, related to a hunting aspect of the subsistence pattern, the bifaces for butchering and the end scrapers for the preparation of hides. The fre quent occurrence of both categories at both sites indicates a similar emphasis on hunting, and makes it unlikely that the infrequent relative occurrence of projectile points at Budenbender is an accurate reflection of the importance of hunting in the economy at that site. The pres ence of tools, provisionally identified as related to hunting tasks, in some abundance in western Central Plains tradition sites, perhaps reinforces the suggestion that hunting was more important in these more westerly sites than in the east. Other tool categories summarized in Figure 10 that warrant mention are retouched and utilized flakes. Klippel (1969:75) points to the high incidence of retouched flakes at Nuzum, as opposed to Mowry Bluff, and suggests this may reflect difficulties in obtaining stone for the production of chipped tools and the necessity of using everything available. This interpretation is brought into question when the extremely high incidence of retouched flakes at Budenbender is noted. In the case of the Budenbender site, gray Flint Hills chert is locally abundant, yet one of 295</page><page sequence="26">TABLE 29 Quantities, percentages, and cumulative percentages of chipped stone artifacts from the Mowry Bluff (25FT35), Nuzum (14DP10), and Budenbender (14P04) sites Mowry Bluff Nuzum Budenbender 25FT35 14DP10 14P04 Cum Cum Cum # % % # % % # % % 1.

Factors other than the difficulty of obtaining material seem to be related to a high incidence of retouched flakes. Utilized flakes occur infrequently at Buden bender. It is possible, however, that this reflects different sorting criteria rather than as marked a variance from the Nuzum and Mowry Bluff situations as is indicated. The certain recognition of utilization on flakes is difficult, and there are 296</page><page sequence="27">no currently agreed upon criteria. This is an area where a good deal of experimental research is required. TAXONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS Similarities in artifacts, features, and dating combine to align the Budenbender site with others of the Central Plains tradition (Lehmer 1954). In a consideration of taxonomic problems of the Central Plains tradition, Krause (1969:82-96) has suggested an adaptation of a slightly modified version of the Willey and Phillips (1958) taxonomic structure. Two well known Central Plains tradition complexes, Nebraska and Upper Republican, are proposed as regional variants, to be subdivided into localities, each of which will encompass a local phase sequence. Krause's (1969) suggestions are adopt ed here and an extension is made to encompass Central Plains tradition manifestations of north central Kansas. The Budenbender site is in close proximity to, and shares many features with, three other north-central Kansas sites (Griffing, Whiteford, and Minneapolis) which Wedel (1959:562-3) suggests can be placed in a Smoky Hill aspect. It is suggested here that Smoky Hill be considered a regional variant comparable to Nebraska and Upper Republican. The region in this case is the Prairie-Plains border of north-central Kansas (north of the Smoky Hill River) and probably also of southern Nebraska. Additional compon ents previously assigned to the Smoky Hill aspect, and herein interpreted as falling within the Smoky Hill regional variant, are the Root site (Witty 1962) and the Woods site (Witty 1963). An extensive collection from the Republican River valley, donated to the Museum of Anthro pology at the University of Kansas by an amateur archaeologist, Mr. Floyd Schultz, includes mater ials from several other Smoky Hill components. Wedel (1959:563) has recognized some points of contrast between components of the Smoky Hill variant, and these potentially provide bases for local phase sequences. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Field aspects of this research were accomplished in June and July of 1957 by a party from the Department of Anthropology at the University of Kansas. The investigations were supported by Contract No. 14-10-232-203 with the National Park Service, Midwest Region. Additional funding and items of equipment were supplied by the University of Kansas. Carlyle S. Smith directed the 1957 investigations, the author of this report acting as field assistant. Members of the excavation party included Theodor Bahr, Charles Eyman, Richard Fischer, Peter Gardner, David Horr, Vladimir Markotic, Barbara Richards, Joan Seibert, and Maria Wille. Assistance in the laboratory analysis was provided by Dennis Yaple (drafting), David Ballou (photography), Ann S. Johnson and Kathleen King (artifact descrip tions). Thanks are due all these individuals, without whose help this report would not have been possible. REFERENCES CITED Bell, E. H. and G.H.
