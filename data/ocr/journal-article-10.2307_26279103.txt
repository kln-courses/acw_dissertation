<plain_text><page sequence="1">POSTURES OF BELIEF IN THE NIGGER OF THE NARCISSUS" Robert Foulke Conrad's voyage fiction has always been praised for verisimilitude. Though critics have been preoccupied with other dimensions of the voyage tales during the past twenty-five years such as archetypal patterns, political analogues, and psychic autobiography, fidelity to the actual conditions of sea life has been assumed and valued. This assumption is much too simplistic to be useful as a start to wards understanding either the mimetic base or the rhetorical strat egies of the voyage tales. It may lead us to somewhat egregious mis takes of interpretation and to a generally inadequate conception of how mimesis operates in Conrad. The reflexive nature of the novel (as described by Professor Miller in his English Institute paper sev eral years ago)1 is fully exploited by Conrad's technical virtuosity. To understand how this is done, we need discriminations finer than those which the shopworn terms "mimesis," "verisimilitude," and "realism" can provide, at least in their present state of overlapping jurisdiction. In its simplest form, the mimetic relationship describes that part of the meaning of words which used to be called their "reference"— i.e., their pointing or naming function, their capacity to call segments of the non-verbal universe to our attention. Among the many inade quacies of this approach to mimetic theory, one is crippling for the reader of fiction. The lack of any exact correspondence between words and what they seem to be pointing to becomes overwhelming in many typical Conradian sentences. Consider the first sentence of Chapter Four in The Nigger of the "Narcissus": "On men reprieved by its disdainful mercy, the immortal sea confers in its justice the full privilege of desired unrest."2 How can we possibly relate this sentence to the debilitating storm whjch the crew of the Narcissus has just sur vived in Chapter Three? All of the key terms make sense only as meta physical, moral, or psychological constructs. Abstractions are bundled together as properties of an anthropomorphic "sea" which seems i J.

Dent &amp; Son», 1950), p. 90; further references to this novel will be by page numbers in this edition. 249</page><page sequence="2">totally alien to the breaking waves and flying spume of the preceding chapter. Clearly, the word "sea" is functioning more as idea than as image in this sentence. When we put the two "seas" together, we are testing one of the many possible correlations between structures of ideation and perception within the narrator's head. What mimesis and verisimilitude refer to is here internalized; the reader is never given an unmediated world of sensory imagery. As Professor Kermode sug gests, we can imagine a world of absolute contingency coming to us through language rather than through immediate sense experience only as an ideal possibility.3 Our problem comes in trying to deter mine what a mimetic base is, what its limits are, how and when it is being used. If more readers had taken long voyages in sailing ships or if the story were told in one voice, we would have less difficulty in noticing how complex the mimetic relationships are in The Nigger of the "Narcissus." There are at least three modes of perception apparent in the language of the text The first is most closely allied to ordinary notions of verisimilitude because it grows out of the narrator's direct observation. The only gap here, and it is sometimes a very wide one, is the reader's lack of information about sea life, which he needs to judge what is being changed or left out. He may miss the implied meaning of described or dramatized events where implication depends upon the way things happen on a sailing ship voyage; he may miscon strue characterization which is completed by historical knowledge of conditions in the British Merchant Service. In neither case is the text a total determinant of meaning because it cannot explain its own holes and distortions. The second mode of perception consists of abstract judgments about men and events in the narrator's voice, with obvious explicit meaning but no clear authority in events. The read er's problem is making connections, either to what is happening or to a narrator revealing himself in what he says, or to both simultane ously. Because this mode often occurs in generalizing passages about mental or emotional states, implied phenomena cannot be distin guished from the perception of them, and the result is blocks of text which contain untéstable assertions; their truth depends neither on the world being imitated in the first mode or on the known eidetic propensities of a fallible, placed character. The third mode of per ception emerges from clusters of metaphor suggesting a mythic voyage complete with archetypal motifs and polarized characters. These con structs are located within the perceiving imagination but are not re lated to all the persons which the narrating presence assumes. They • Cf. Frank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), Ch. V, esp. pp. 150-151. 250 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">tend to be visualized rather than voiced, and they are clearly evoked by what can be seen by a man on board the Narcissus as the generaliza tions of the second mode are not. In quite different ways, all three modes of perception internalize parts of the mimetic base of the novel. \ II We can see why Conrad needed diverse rhetorical strategies by examining the connection between mimesis and point of view through out the voyage stories. The Nigger of the "Narcissus," Typhoon, and "The End of the Tether" convey perceptions which no character is capable of having on his own. The Singletons, MacWhirrs, and Whalleys of the voyage stories are often interesting to us because their relation to the sea world being imitated is complicated, not because they are intrinsically complex characters. Conrad's technical prob lem becomes one of catching the full reality of the lived moment at sea without having any intelligence on board ship subtle enough to see analogies between that moment and other experiences in the past, between an action and some abstract value inherent in it, or even between the simple facts of experience and some emotional response to them. Some of Conrad's seamen are perceptual incompetents. We remember that Captain MacWhirr, for example, has no conception of the typhoon beyond "dirty weather" and that he is incapable of human feelings about it until the cataclysm is reduced to disorder in his own cabin. As Conrad's techniques evolved, he developed two increasingly sophisticated strategies for marrying perception and mimesis in voyage stories. The most obvious is Marlow. We can see a paradigm of Marlow's function, though a clumsy one, in his first appearance as the narrator of "Youth." All the perception is poured into the old Marlow telling the story, all the mimesis into the young Marlow acting—a young man naively unresponsive to the decrepit hulk which he sails on and the half insane captain who commands her. Conrad uses this same cub, particularly in the closing scenes of the small boat voyage and first glimpse of the East, as a vehicle for reaching beyond ordinary human perception to a fantasy world, dreamlike and solipsistic. Real ity is totally internalized, being merely triggered by what is happening to ship and crew. The young Marlow who thrills to the last supper on the poop of the burning ship, who sees the lifeboat as his first "com mand," and who transforms an ordinary Javanese harbor into paradise prefigures the absolute innocence of the young Russian in "Heart of Darkness" and the vulnerability of Lord Jim. Such characters cannot be said to "live" in the mimetic world of their voyage any more than the MacWhirrs and Whalleys do if we mean by living what old Marlow POSTURES OF BELIEF 251</page><page sequence="4">represents: a man who can observe the minutiae of the visible and audible world, who can entertain conceptions which unify parts of this world into wholes, who can relate these wholes to human values like honor, courage, work, craft, fidelity, and solidarity without falsi fying his perceptions or abandoning the values. As a device for simul taneously creating a solid mimetic world, an intelligence for perceiv ing it, and a means of transforming it into the absolute terms of archetypal quest, the old-young Marlow works surprisingly well, not only in "Youth" but in "Heart of Darkness." In this connection the elaborate frames surrounding old Marlow as he tells the story remind us that the old man is as real as the young one, and that neither is Conrad himself, an almost disappearing presence who is the totally silent crewman of the Nellie. In Lord, Jim the device is modified: old Marlow identifies with young Jim, and the tensions between the experience of the teller and the innocence of the actor become stronger and more explicit. Mar low can vacillate between acceptance and rejection, and fragments of his perception of Jim become objective characters like the French Lieutenant, Brierly, Chester, Robinson, and Gentleman Brown, while Marlow himself has an ideal alter-ego in Stein. Ways of being start in Marlow's head, then move inexorably towards the cast and conse quences which a recalcitrant mimetic world (as Kenneth Burke uses that term) might impose on any ideal conception of self. If the dere lict Patna is the reality principle in the first part of the novel, one which is totally at odds with Jim's immature dreams of a world acclimated to heroism, Patusan is a country both imaginary and real, where a Hollywood scenario of the East mingles with the muck of a river village in Borneo. A later version of the same narrating device is the Doppelgänger of "The Secret Sharer" and The Shadow-Line, where all the conflict of perception is built into the schizophrenic young captains who tell their own stories. Although the use of Leg gatt in "The Secret Sharer" and Captain Giles in The Shadow-Line can be seen as remnants of the objectifying technique of Lord Jim, it seems clear that only internal perception counts in these late fear haunted voyages. The seascape is almost totally a projection of the narrator's mood, and the tests which the young captain passes are largely self-created since both the approach to Koh-ring and putting to sea with an incomplete and sickly crew are avoidable in the real world of seafaring. The mimetic principle has been totally submerged in the dream world which permeates these voyages, and the normative perception of old Marlow has disintegrated into the hollow principles of Captain Archbold of the Sephora and the talky platitudes of a senile harbormaster like Captain Giles. 252 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">This evolution of Conrad's narrative technique can also be con strued as a movement away from mimesis towards fantasy. It is cer tainly true that a dream world saturates much of his later fiction— Under Western Eyes, The Arrow of Gold, "Freya of the Seven Isles," "The Planter of Malata," and "The Tale" as well as "The Secret Sharer" and The Shadow-Line. In the voyage stories which use a narrator, there is a shift in the way of relating external and internal reality. The early device of an older and more experienced man musing on what he did as a youth dichotomizes perception with a cleavage between act and understanding, dream and fact. The result is a process of disillusionment in a narrator who is unwilling to re pudiate his former self and unable to connect what the world is like with inner visions of what it ought to be. Thus old Marlow in "Heart of Darkness" ends by telling a lie to the Intended because the truth which he has discovered has no human value. He is left with an absolute disrelation between what he has heard or seen and the civiliz ing constructs of his own imagination—work, restraint, even truth itself. The second Marlow of Lord Jim (and Chance) is no longer narrat ing his own autobiography, but the gain in objectivity paradoxically allows him to be more subjective and hypothetical. As has already been suggested, he has the freedom of approach and withdrawal, sympathy and repudiation in his relations to Jim; he is no longer con fined by the fundamental premise of a continuing self as he was in the earlier stories. His role as tale-teller is less restricted because he has no obligation to maintain the minimal illusion of verisimilitude built into autobiographical narration: completeness. He lacks the con straint of knowing the whole of Jim's life, as he would his own, and can, therefore, freely play with juxtapositions which have no effect on Jim's consciousness but illuminate his "case." In this sense Big Brierly is an imaginative projection of one of Marlow's ideas about Jim; his suicide, which has no etiology in the novel, sucks meaning from Jim's case through a metaphor of infection. Brierly's jump is connected to Jim's only through this intricate mental structure: the same act (abandoning ship) in Jim's case is his unadmitted failure whereas in Brierly's it prevents an imagined failure somehow caught at the court of inquiry by simple exposure to Jim, who is connected to Brierly only by the slim links of nationality and profession. Brierly is meaningful only as a figment of Marlow's imagination. Mimetically considered, his suicide could have been motivated by ennui or self-disgust or a bagful of other unprovided reasons more convincing than his tenuous link with Jim. But the controlling principle of Marlow's narration is not what he sees and hears so much as the structures of explanation POSTURES OF BELIEF 253</page><page sequence="6">being spun out of his own head as a web to catch events. This non autobiographical Marlow succeeds as a perceiver, though somewhat erratically and clumsily, because he does unite internal vision with external fact. He has less hard truth than his predecessor in "Youth" and "Heart of Darkness," but more meaning. The third stage of Conrad's technical evolution rejoins narrator and actor in one person without erecting impenetrable barriers between thought and act, but many of the later Mar low's perceptual gains are sacrificed. The hallucinatory quality of the world perceived by the captain-narrators of "The Secret Sharer" and The Shadow-Line leads to a new solipsism and continually threatens schizophrenia. Young Marlow in "Youth" had the power of transforming external fact into dream, whereas the somewhat paranoid young captains in the later voyages are menaced by nightmares which assimilate external sensa tions. The slightest deviation in nautical routine can unleash malevo lent powers which must be ritually exorcised. Assuming the first watch (which is traditionally stood by the first mate) in "The Secret Sharer" and failing actually to taste the quinine powder in The Shadow-Line bring upon the young captains a disproportionate sense of guilt and fill their minds with traumatic visions of failure. Every sensation must be read for its occult significance. These young cap tains are enclosed in a self which screens out unanticipated signals from the outer world to such a degree that they invent second selves, Leggatt and the dead Captain, to anthropomorphize the threat of that outer world. Unlike the later Marlow, they are trapped by their own perceptions; they are unable to conceptualize a dichotomy be tween world and self. One key to this change is the lack of any stable orientation in space or time. The measurable progress of an ordinary voyage disappears, making navigation useless; even the comforting stability of sensory expectation—the heel of the ship, the curve of sails, the feel of wind coming from a constant direction, the regularity of waves, the straight wake stretching out astern—evaporates in the total immobility of a becalmed ship. The very fact that the external world does not change casts doubt upon its reality. The perspective of time also disappears. The mature narrator implied at the begin ning and end of both tales loses his distance in the middle and is no longer able to evaluate an experience which he relives. What he knows about the world outside of his head cannot restrain the chaotic images filling his imagination. Ill It has been convenient to describe the correlation between mimesis and point of view in terms of later voyage stories where the use of a 254 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">narrator is explicit and relatively consistent. To speak of the narrator in The Nigger of the "Narcissus" is to create a fiction within a fiction, for there are many, each one performing some of the functions of the more clearly objectified narrators in later voyages. Conrad had not yet found Marlow when he wrote The Nigger of the "Narcissus," though he does want to do what Marlow can do best—i.e., juxtapose abstract statement with fictional event, time of narration with time of action, explanation of cause with immediate perception. The result is a ghostly paradigm of Marlow, eyes and ears which cannot always be fixed in time or space combined with an unmistakable but often mistaken voice. And this is the dilemma for the reader: a human voice which cannot be held accountable for all of its pronouncements. The elusive narrator of The Nigger of the "Narcissus" resembles Kurtz more than Marlow, an insubstantial voice rather than a physical pres ence, and one which vacillates between the extremes of rhapsody and denunciation. Yet this unreliable, shifting voice has often been taken as Conrad's mouthpiece of theme in the novel. To do so is to over look a number of important cues in the text. The three interlocked modes of perception distinguish the narrator from an omniscient, editorializing author. Spatially, the narrator is versatile to the point of exasperation. This technique can be justified in terms of the novel's scope: individual seamen, the crew as a whole, officers, and the ship herself must be seen in ways which no firmly placed narrator could manage.4 The reader's problem is clearly one of authority. Are the narrator's mutations an index of his reliability? Is he less fallible the higher he gets in the sky, the farther he is removed from the "we" who is presumably an ordinary seaman in the forecastle? The easiest answer to these ques tions attaches greater authority to the withdrawn narrator, less to the involved, but we cannot justify this weighting when we look closely at the generalizing passages of the text. They are charged with pos sible attitudes rather than simple truths. The narrator is just as sus ceptible to momentary impulses in the third person as he is in the first person. In his attempts to comprehend the chaotic experience of the crew, visions of order quickly fade into their opposites. Such incon sistency is most apparent when he tries to create a moral dichotomy between pure life at sea and sordid existence ashore: "The true peace of God begins at any spot a thousand miles from the nearest land; and when He sends there the messengers of His might it is not in terrible wrath against crime, presumption, and folly, but paternally, to chasten «Cf. Albert Guerard, Conrad the Novelist (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press 1958), Ch. 3 and Ian Watt, "Conrad Criticism and The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'" Ninr'. teenth Century Fiction, 12 (March 1958), 260. ' POSTURES OF BELIEF 255</page><page sequence="8">simple hearts—ignorant hearts that know nothing of life, and beat undisturbed by envy or greed" (p. 31). Apart from our general sus picion of this passage—throughout the novels and letters, references to Christianity tend to be ironic—we recall its contradiction just two paragraphs earlier: "like that earth which had given her up to the sea, she [the Narcissus] had an intolerable load of regrets and hopes. On her lived timid truth and audacious lies, and, like the earth, she was unconscious, fair to see—and condemned by men to an ignoble fate" (pp. 29-30). Another example of the narrator's inability to hold his attitudes steady occurs in his distanced vision of the final stages of the voyage, balancing his struggle with the land/sea dichotomy of the beginning. At the end the land itself becomes a giant pure ship—"a vessel of fabulous dimensions ... an indestructible craft riding motionless upon the immortal and unresting sea" (p. 162)—in the most notorious extended metaphor of the novel. Structurally, this metaphor which reduces the life of the earth to that of the ship is the inverse of the one which expanded the ship into "a small plant," "a fragment de tached from the earth" (p. 29). The voyage begins and ends in macrocosm/microcosm figures which identify ship and earth. In both passages the narrator struggles for coherence by jamming opposites together, as though forcing them into the confines of a single sentence would automatically fuse them. The planet-ship of departure houses timidity and audaciousness, truth and lies, and is herself both beau tiful and ignobly condemned. The ship-earth which the Narcissus approaches at the end of the voyage "towered up immense and strong, guarding priceless traditions and untold suffering, sheltering glorious memories and base forgetfulness, ignoble virtues and splendid trans gressions" (pp. 162-63). The double oxymoron at the end of this sentence prepares the narrator for his final plunge into apostrophe: "A great shipl ... A ship mother of fleets and nationsl The great flagship of the race; stronger than the storms! and anchored in the open sea" (p. 163). But the narrator does not even try to hold on to this apocalyptic (and chauvinistic) vision. By the end of the next paragraph the land is again sordid, and the city appears as the black cloud which opens and closes "Heart of Darkness." The narrator returns to the now familiar regret, hope, and folly of the initial planet ship, applied to the city which is heard as "an immense and lament able murmur—the murmur of millions of lips praying, cursing, sigh ing, jeering—the undying murmur of folly, regret, and hope exhaled by the crowds of the anxious earth" (pp. 163-64). Summarizing these opposed sets of images applied to land, sea, ship, seamen, and city dweller shows us how unreliable the narrator is when he generalizes, 256 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">but logical inconsistencies are beside the point. The intellectual con tent of these passages is minimal, a frame for metaphor more than predication. Incantatory prose bolsters up the narrator's unsteady view of life. Third-person narration closer to the immediate scene seems to be more reliable, but it is often undercut by minute observation (some times in the first person plural). The narrator wants to believe that human effort has some meaning. During the righting of the ship, which occurs as the storm subsides, we can believe in Captain Allis toun's determination: "The master's ardour, the cries of that silent man inspired us" (p. 86). In a scene which reminds us of Leggatt's crime in "The Secret Sharer," Allistoun threatens Donkin with a belaying pin and bullies the crew into risking their lives for the sake of the ship. But the same heroic pose earlier in the storm represents nothing but the narrator's wish fulfillment: "with living eyes he was still holding the ship up, heeding no one, as if lost in the unearthly effort of that endeavor" (p. 74). Quite literally, the captain has nothing to do at that point. The storm has dwarfed his authority and destroyed his power to control the small universe of the ship. Like the rest of the crew, the narrator wants to believe in the old hierarchy, the old routine, even though decks have become walls and rudders no longer steer. A disoriented ship and a mad sea do not foster a sense of pro portion, so what he reports often undercuts his illusions. Wait's rescue, the most heroic deed of the crew, is bracketed by two moments of total indifference to the value of saving human life. The first occurs when Belfast almost falls overboard: "We shouted all together with dismay; but with his legs overboard he held and yelled for a rope. In our extremity nothing could be terrible; so we judged him funny kicking there, and with his scared face. Some one began to laugh, and, as if hysterically infected with screaming merriment, all those haggard men went off laughing, wild-eyed, like a lot of maniacs tied up on a wall" (p. 64). After the rescue, Podmore disappears on his heroic mission—making coffee: "An hour or more afterwards some one said distinctly: 'He's gone for good.'—'Very likely,' assented the boatswain; 'even in fine weather he was as smart about the deck as a milch-cow on her first voyage. We ought to go and see.' Nobody moved" (p. 81. A few paragraphs later the narrator spends a whole paragraph extolling the cook's heroism and berating his conceit; there is an unmistakable note of the mock heroic in this paragraph, just as there is open sarcasm in the narrator's later evaluation of the whole crew's behavior during the storm: "And we were conceited! We boasted of our pluck, of our capacity for work, of our energy. We POSTURES OF BELIEF 257</page><page sequence="10">remembered honourable episodes: our devotion, our indomitable per severance—and were proud of them as though they had been the out come of our unaided impulses. We remembered our danger, our toil —and conveniently forgot our horrible scare" (p. 100). Thus the total meaning of the storm cannot be reduced to themes of fidelity and soli darity; it remains hung between the poles of "indomitable persever ance" and "horrible scare." The narrator's insecurity makes us enter tain Marlow's doubt in Lord Jim—"the doubt of the sovereign power enthroned in a fixed standard of conduct."5' There are also complications within the narrator's identified posi tion, the "we" which represents an anonymous seaman in the fore castle. This "we" fluctuates between immediacy and retrospection. At some times he reports sensations as if they were happening; at others, he evaluates them in the perspective of what is to come. Questions of authority do not arise in "Youth" and "Heart of Darkness" because we can easily distinguish the old narrator's conceptualizing from the young seaman's naïve response to the same experience. The Nigger of the "Narcissus" does not have this mechanism for projecting atti tude and observation simultaneously, but the first person plural nar rator vacillates between the same poles of foreknowledge and inno cence. At a number of points in the text we catch him speaking as if the voyage had been completed. The second section of Chapter Four begins with a paragraph in which the "we" shapes the whole voyage conceptually as a journey in two parts, divided geographically and psychologically by the Cape of Good Hope: "Yet from that time our life seemed to start afresh as though we had died and had been resus citated" (p. 100). Serial narration of the voyage makes this kind of retrospection unavoidable in the first person plural. The use of "we" establishes a double identification, linking the narrator with the crew (time of action) and with the reader (time of narration). Since this convention destroys any illusion that the two times are identical —that the narrator is having his experience as we read—we can never believe the narrator to be totally innocent. The "we" who tells us the beginning of the voyage has already experienced its end, so as wise speaker he can only pretend to be naïve by recalling his impressions at the time of action. The difficulties of this role are insurmountable when the narrator needs to back away in space (shifting from the first to the third person) or condense time (shifting from the definite past to the continuous past). The narrating "we" uses a syntax and vocab ulary beyond the reach of an ordinary seaman, and the seaman ex presses a gullibility which is impossible after the voyage has been com pleted. These are the cues telling us which "we" is speaking at any 6 Lord Jim (Dent Collected Edition), p. 50. 258 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">point in the text and reminding us that neither one can be taken at face value. This split "we" gives us a double take which is essential if we are to believe in the crew's corruption by Wait. The naïve narrator, as spokesman for the emotions of the crew, is alternately attracted and repelled by Jimmy, remaining in doubt about his sickness until the end of Chapter Four. The wise narrator, on the other hand, knows that Jimmy is both shamming and dying. After expostulating "No man could be suspected of such a monstrous friendship!", the naïve narrator asks the question in his typical either/or form: "Was he a reality—or was he a sham—this ever-expected visitor of Jimmy's?" (p. 36). A few pages later he starts a sentence which the wise narrator finishes: "We were trying to be decent chaps, and found it jolly diffi cult; we oscillated between the desire of virtue and the fear of ridi cule; we wished to save ourselves from the pain of remorse, but did not want to be made the contemptible dupes of our sentiment" (p. 41). The conjunction of simple and sophisticated attitudes towards Wait sometimes occurs in sentences which nearly match each other: "You couldn't see that there was anything wrong with him: a nigger does not show" (p. 44); ". . . no one could tell what was the mean ing of that black man sitting apart in a meditative attitude and as motionless as a carving" (p. 45). The style of the naïve narrator returns once more just after Jimmy's death: "In our hearts we thought that in the matter of his departure Jimmy had acted in a perverse and unfriendly manner. He didn't back us up, as a shipmate should" (p. 156). The wise narrator has the final word a few lines later: "Doubt survived Jimmy; and, like a band of criminals disintegrated by a touch of grace, we were profoundly scandalized with each other." It is easy to overlook the point of all this vacillation. The narrator who feels the doubts of the crew is looking for a simple truth which can be proved or disproved by the course of events, a certainty comparable to Singleton's superstition. The narrator who tells the story and looks back upon the whole voyage is not so easily satisfied. When he joins the crew in lying to Jimmy "with unshaken fidelity" (p. 143), the dichotomy between truth and falsehood collapses. The poles coalesce as he questions the relevance of any belief to the structure of reality, if there is a structure. His truth is partial, unstable, perhaps illusory, and always inadequate; his doubts cannot be allayed by the arrival of wind. In all of his persons, the narrator gives us postures of belief, grasped hopes rather than absolute truths. This becomes obtrusively clear in the final switch to the first person singular. The "I" who describes the reunion of Charley with his mother is so maudlin that POSTURES OF BELIEF 259</page><page sequence="12">he seems to be parodying his former roles: "I was passing him at the time, and over the untidy head of the blubbering woman he gave me a humorous smile and a glance ironic, courageous, and profound, that seemed to put all my knowledge of life to shame" (p. 171). The final phrase becomes absurd when it is lifted out of its original context ("We understood the subtlety of his [Jimmy's] fear, sympathised with all his repulsions, shrinkings, evasions, delusions—as though we had been overcivilised, and rotten, and without any knowledge of the meaning of life." [p. 139]) and placed here. The same narrator avoids Belfast with a magazine cliché: " 'So long!' I said, and went on my way" (p. 171). And his concluding rhapsody reminds us of the crew's "sentimental lie": ". . . at times the springflood of memory sets with force up the dark River of the Nine Bends. Then on the waters of the forlorn stream drifts a ship—a shadowy ship manned by a crew of Shades. They pass and make a sign, in a shadowy hail. Haven't we, together and upon the immortal sea, wrung out a meaning from our sinful lives? Good-bye brothers! You were a good crowd. As good a crowd as ever fisted with wild cries the beating canvas of a heavy foresail; or tossing aloft, invisible in the night, gave back yell for yell to a westerly gale" (p. 173). Such passages are often ridiculed by associating them with a direct authorial voice, but the speaker here is really a distillation of the two "we's." One, like any sentimental old voyager, is bound to exaggerate the hardships which he has endured; the other has been reading "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner." Thus the reader is left with two impulses at the end of the narra tive. One leads him to doubt the celebration of a seaman narrator, to wonder whether the question buried in the middle of this last para graph is in fact rhetorical. The other leads him to follow the narrat ing voice as it becomes excited to the pitch of high rhetoric—to share a vision appropriate to pure romance in which characters are noble and actions heroic within a surrealistic seascape. Both impulses are valid; to deny either distorts the text. One has its source in the natur alistic rendering of life at sea, the other in the hallucinatory world evoked by a fulness of metaphor. IV Although the voyage cannot be simplified into moral allegory, sym bolic interpretation is unavoidable. The text is crammed with meta phoric structures. Just as what the narrator says is an attempt to establish belief—to fill the skies, or at least man's head, with the abstract principles of an unshakeable code of conduct—what he sees, or more precisely the way in which he sees, is often a compulsive matching of immediate and imagined experience, marked by a torrent of eidetic imagery and elaborate simile. The narrator continually 260 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">propels us into a world of mysterious presences where wind becomes a "reminder of their [the crew's] dependence upon the invisible" (p. 146). The ship is "lost in a vast universe of night and silence where gentle sighs wandering here and there like forlorn souls, made the still sails flutter as in sudden fear, and the ripple of a beshrouded ocean whisper its compassion afar—in a voice mournful, immense, and faint ..." (p. 104). When the Narcissus docks a bridge opens "as if by enchantment" and capstans turn "as though animated by a mysterious and unholy spell" (p. 164). There is a frequent crossing of the shadow-line between the seen and the unseen, the everyday and the extraordinary. During the struggle to rescue Wait from the deck house, his body mysteriously ascends; during the burial scene, the corpse refuses to descend until Belfast's ritual touch sends it whizzing into the sea. Repeatedly, we get both a sense of the actual voyage, with its scrupulously rendered detail, and suggestions of a world appropriate to pure romance. The three major tests of the story—storm, mutiny, and death—are associated with mysterious appearances from below. During the rescue, we recall, Wait rises "like a bladder full of gas" (p. 70), and the final corruption of the crew is accomplished when "Jimmy bobbed up upon the surface, compelling attention, like a black buoy chained to the bottom of a muddy stream" (p. 138). Similarly Donkin appears before the captain in the final phase of the mutiny "as though he had come up through the deck" (p. 135). The end of two tests is marked by a wanderer's return from the wasteland. After the rescue, "the return on the poop was like the return of wanderers after many years amongst people marked by the desolation of time" (p. 74). After Wait's death, Donkin is "perfectly astounded to find the world outside as he had left it; there was the sea, the ship—sleeping men; and he wondered absurdly at it; as though he had expected to find the men dead, familiar things gone for ever: as though, like a wanderer re turning after many years, he had expected to see bewildering changes" (p. 155). Bracketed between storm and death is the other test of mutiny, which closes with the imagery of rejuvenation and treasure usually found at the end of romance: In the morning the ship, beginning another day of her wandering life, had an aspect of sumptuous freshness, like the spring-time of the earth. The washed decks glistened in a long clear stretch; the oblique sunlight struck the yellow brasses in dazzling splashes, darted over the polished rods in lines of gold, and the single drops of salt water forgotten here and there along the rail were as limpid as drops of dew, and sparkled more than scattered diamonds, (pp. 132-133) The ship herself is the treasure here—for a moment. In a manner anticipating Nostromo, the treasure motif recurs in such images as POSTURES OF BELIEF 261</page><page sequence="14">"jewels," "gold," "priceless," "splendid," and "prize" when the Nar cissus is transformed into the macrocosmic "vessel of fabulous dimen sions" (pp. 162-63). And it returns again in a black-and-white cluster at the end of the novel: "And to the right of the dark group the stained front of the Mint, cleansed by the flood of light, stood out for a moment dazzling and white like a marble palace in a fairy tale" (p. 172). As we respond to the imagery of wasteland, descent, and treasure, and to the religious imagery associated with it (e.g., the crew climbing the shrouds "in attitudes of crucifixion" [p. 56], the rescue party casting nails upon the sea, or the deckhouse appearing as "a silver shrine where a black idol . . . received our homage" [p. 105]) the archetypal pattern of romance is clear and strong. The elements of initiation, three major tests, three descents to the underworld (deck house) in the rescue, Podmore's Hell, and the death scene, and three returns to the normal world of the ship after wandering are all there. But this whole structure is fabricated of similes, as the repetition of "like," "as," and "as though" reminds us, and the moment of rejuve nation occurs between the rage of the storm and the demoralization of death. At the end the ship dies in a filthy dock and the crew dis intergrates in a sordid city. What one critic calls "the ultimate quality of sense experience"8 is counterpoised against the narrator's dreams. Taken together, the metaphoric structures do not support simpli fied readings of The Nigger of the "Narcissus." Polarities of vision are not aligned with the oppositions of a speaking narrator who tries to impose moral order on the world. There is really no a priori reason for holding that die novel should be a romantic affirmation of tradi tional values. Conrad's ironic tendencies are already strong in Al mayer's Folly and The Outcast of the Islands, and they gain full force in "Heart of Darkness" and Lord Jim, both written just a few years after The Nigger of the "Narcissus." The image of men "lost, alone, forgetful, and doomed" at the end of the novel suggests one of Con rad's recurrent themes: "they were like castaways, like reckless and joyous castaways, like mad castaways making merry in the storm and upon an insecure ledge of a treacherous rock" (p. 172). Here, as elsewhere in Conrad's fiction, men cannot pretend that their truths offer anything but a choice of illusions, that their code of conduct is anything more than Lord Jim's "merciless dream." «J.
