Altering Hydrodynamic Torque Converter Per- formance. M. J. Wacławek, Clark Equipment Co. The paper describes the different types of polyphase, multistage and floating element hydrodynamic torque converters and their variations. Also described are all possible methods of combining torque converters with gearing to alter their performance. The gear systems reviewed are: differentially geared, differential reactors, conventionally geared, and auxiliary element geared. All these systems are also investigated in both input- and output-coupled arrangements. Also shown is a parametric method of representing torque converter performance when more than two elements are permitted to rotate. Equations are disclosed which permit performance cal- culations for all types of geared element torque converters and combinations. 1973 SA E Transactions 730002. Performance Effects of Vehicle Variables. Walter Fisher, Borg-Warner Corp. The separate effects of important variables in vehicle and transmission design are evaluated as they relate to performance, and are given in terms of vehicle speed and wheel torque. The significance of the variables is shown in steady-state gradeability and acceleration performance curves, with speed versus wheel torque plotted on logarithmic scales. The effects of vehicle variables as deduced from this analysis may be used as a basis for prediciting performance of various vehicle and transmis- sion designs. 730003. Design Equations for a Speed and Torque Controlled Variable Ratio V-Belt Transmission. L. R. Oliver, Dayco Corp.; and K. G. Hornung, J. E. Swenson and H. N. Shapiro, The Ohio State University. A type of V-belt drive which shifts ratios in accordance with input speed and output torque has been successfully employed as the transmission for vehicles ranging from snowmobiles to compact automobiles. Increasing popu- larity of this kind of transmission has created the need for more reliable criteria to be used in its design. This paper presents a derivation of design equations for a symmet- rical V-belt drive in which centrifugal control is governed by an expanding garter spring and torque control results from a helical cam. Experimental results are included which support the validity of these equations. 1973 SA E Transactions 730004. Spark Ignition Engine Control Variables Study. T. W. Keranen and H. P. Wertheimer, The Bendix Corp. Systematic testing of a fuel injected 429 in3 (7.03 dm3) V-8 engine at steady states produced data from which the effects on emissions of three control variables in com- bination could be determined. Plotted data of brake specific nitric oxide, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide, 730001-730006 as well as brake specific fuel consumption, are presented as a function of air-fuel ratio, ignition timing, and percent of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Analysis of trends shows that EGR permits nitric oxides control with less fuel consumption penalty than extreme rich operation alone. Nitric oxide control is shown to be important at low power levels as well as high, while hydrocarbons are much more of a problem at the lowest power levels than at high engine outputs. An optimum engine size for the weight of a vehicle is indicated. Simulation of warm engine emission tests permits comparisons between several control ap- proaches, suggesting entirely different calibrations are indicated for different emission performance goals. 730005. Closed-Loop Electronic Fuel Injection Control of the Internal Combustion Engine. J. G. Rivard, The Bendix Corp. Electronic fuel injection (EFI) provides very precise control of fuel distribution to the individual cylinders of the internal combustion engine under both steady-state and transient operating conditions, and so permits very exact control of exhaust chemistry. For a time, EFI fuel distribution was scheduled or preprogrammed with high accuracy on the basis of several sensed engine parameters. More recently, closed-loop control of electronic fuel injection, with its many attendant advantages, has been realized. For this closed-loop system, a sensor has been developed that measures oxygen concentrations in the exhaust gases and outputs an electric voltage that changes sharply as the air/fuel ratio approaches the stoichiometric point. By sensing this unique operating point and feeding back signals to the electronic control circuitry, it becomes possible to so vary the fuel distribution that the air/fuel ratio can be realistically maintained within a ratio range of ± 0. 1 . The three-way exhaust-gas catalyst used with the closed-loop control very efficiently reduces the concen- trations of all three harmful emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen) within this limited ratio range. The system has demonstrated in the laboratory (low mileage) 1976 emission levels and still provides good vehicle driveability, performance and fuel economy. Discussion: Gary L.

New Piston Ring Innovations to Help Control Automotive Engine Emissions. H. F. Prasse, H. E. McCormick and R. D. Anderson, Piston Ring Div., TRW Inc. This paper briefly reviews the progress in reducing emissions over the past eight years through improved piston ring designs and compatible facings. The newer emissions control laws for 1976 require considerable further work in reducing emissions from every possible source. The authors discuss the green engine effect and suggest the use of reduced-friction piston rings to yield 79</page><page sequence="3">730007-730013 assembly-line emissions test results more nearly repre- sentative of the emissions from an engine after extended break-in running. To reduce oil contamination for the purpose of conserving natural resources by extending oil change intervals and also to reduce emissions, the writers propose the use of zero blow-by piston rings and discuss a novel design. New piston ring facings may also play a part in improving durability and compatibility when ashless oils are specified and when the piston rings must be mounted at the top of the piston. 730007. Automotive Headlamp Aiming - Intentions and Results. R. M. Terry, Virginia State Police. This paper outlines some of the problems encountered on the state level in enforcing regulations regarding the accurate aiming of motor vehicle headlamps. State regulations vary through the United States, as does the enforcement of such regulations. The State of Virginia has taken a number of steps to ensure that the headlights on vehicles operating within the state are the best possible: training and retraining of inspectors; improved super- vision of the inspection process; adaptation of the aiming tolerances allowed in SAE J599, Lighting Inspection Code; and a constant awareness that state officials must keep up to date with changes in the technology and engineering of lighting devices. 730008. Automotive Headlamp Aiming as Applied at the Motor Vehicle Inspection Station. Dennis Eis- nach, South Dakota Highway Patrol. The aiming of headlamps in nonlaboratory conditions poses many problems. The variables involved are dis- cussed such as qualifications of the personnel, the physical plant, equipment, the consumer, and the vehicle itself. Suggested remedies are directed to the vehicle owner, the administration of inspection programs, and to the engi- neering and design of the vehicle. Realizing that much jurisdictional red tape is involved in vehicle lighting, it is imperative that the lighting engineer and the state administrators cooperate to the fullest extent to provide the necessary uniformity. 730009. Problems in Passenger Car Headlamp Aim. Warren M. Heath, California Highway Patrol. Maintenance and inspection of correct aim of headlamps on passenger vehicles has been a perennial problem that involves unstable headlamp mounting, imprecision in inspecting equipment, variations in sealed beam units, improper initial aim of lamps on new vehicles, and other factors. Improvement has occurred in each of these areas, but it has not kept pace with the need for better controlled roadway illumination. Brighter low-beam headlamp sys- tems that are on the horizon will require increased attention and new solutions to the problems. 730010. Compatibility of Headlamp Aim and Inspection. J. W. Murphy, Guide Lamp Div., General Motors Corp. The paper discusses current efforts to increase the compatibility of methods of aiming and inspecting presently used two-beam headlamp systems. The three aiming methods now employed are named, and the requirements and disadvantages of each are presented. Charts indicate the accuracy of each method, and the probability of acceptance of a unit that is aimed mechanically and inspected by another method is deter- mined. Recent work in the field is summarized, and future goals and considerations are noted. 730011. Headlamp Aim Correcting Devices. K. J. Jones and A. M. MacMillan, Joseph Lucas (Electrical) Ltd. Present vehicle suspensions result in considerable changes in vehicle attitudes with varying loads. These changes can greatly affect headlamp performance. This paper exam- ines the need for accurate headlamp aim and considers the performance requirements of automatic aim-correcting devices and the performance of a specific arrangement now being fitted experimentally to a number of British cars. 1973 SAE Transactions 730012. Road Rating Trends of United States Motor Cars - A Review of Recent CRC Programs. Bruce S. Bailey, Texaco Inc., E. J. Forster, Ethyl Corp.; and William E. Morris, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. A review of the CRC road rating programs conducted between 1952 and 1971 indicates that: 1. Equations based on RON and MON are satis- factory for predicting the road octane numbers of gasolines. 2. MON has become more important and RON less important in prediction equations. 3. Variables such as percent aroma tics, Pb concen- tration, and DON are not broadly significant and improve RON/MON equation predictions only in restricted applications. 4. Car appreciation of low-sensitivity fuels has in- creased, while appreciation of high-sensitivity fuels has decreased. 5. Road octane response to increase in laboratory octane quality has decreased. 6. Variability of road octane testing and predictions have remained substantially constant over the past 20 years. 7. Because of variability considerations, measurements of road versus laboratory octane relationships and estimates of car satisfaction are subject to significant errors. 730013. ORI in 1971 Model Cars- With and Without Lead. H. A. Bigley, Jr., Gulf Research &amp; 80</page><page sequence="4">Development Co.; and J. D. Benson, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. During 1970-1971, 15 organizations participated in a Coordinating Research Council program to compare the influence of unleaded and leaded gasolines on octane requirement increase (ORI). A total of 147 1971 model cars (47 pairs and 53 individual cars) were operated for 8000-20,000 miles using driving schedules prescribed by each participant. One car of each pair was run on an unleaded fuel of 91-95 Research octane number (RON) and the other on a leaded fuel of similar quality. For paired cars, the average ORI was 5.8 RON for unleaded and 3.8 RON for leaded fuel cars. The ORI difference of 2.0 RON for paired cars was slightly less than the average ORI difference of 2.5 RON for all 75 unleaded and 48 leaded cars. In a supplemental program, results in 20 cars showed an average ORI difference of only 0.3 RON between unleaded and low-lead fuel cars. 730014. Gasoline Lead Additive and Cost Effects of Potential 1975-1976 Emission Control Systems. M. G. Hinton, Jr., T. Iura and J. Meitzer, The Aerospace Corp.; and J. H. Somers, Environ- mental Protection Agency. A study was conducted in 1971 to assess the overall effects of lead additives in gasoline on the performance, dura- bility, and costs of emission control devices/systems which might be used to meet the 1975-1976 federal emission standards for light-duty motor vehicles. Al- though no system has yet demonstrated meeting the 50,000-mile emission level lifetime, all currently planned 1975-1976 emission control systems include a catalytic converter. However, lead additives are toxic to catalytic materials; they reduce catalytic activity, which results in increasing emission levels with mileage accumulation. Unleaded gasoline would be required in quantities sufficient to satisfy the demands of vehicles equipped with a catalytic converter in order to prevent catalyst activity degradation from lead additives. Implementation of such advanced emission control systems implies very high cost to the consumer, with the cost being a strong function of the required NOx emission level. At this time, estimated overall costs to the consumer (initial, maintenance, and operating) for emission control systems being considered for the 1976 federal emission standards are $860 above average 1970 vehicle costs, over an 85,000-mile vehicle lifetime. This estimate is based on a system incorporating a dual (HC/CO, NOJ catalytic converter, a low-grade rich thermal reactor, and exhaust gas recirculation. This system is currently considered to have the most promise to meet the 1976 NOx standard of 0.4 g/mile. Discussion: E. N. Cantwell, Jr., E. I. du Pont de Nemours. 1973 SA E Transactions 730017. Some Factors Limiting Driver-Vehicle Perform- ance. Rudolf G. Mortimer and Paul L. Olson, Highway Safety Res. Inst., University of Mich- igan. 730014-730019 The measurement of drivers' performance at the limit of capability is difficult due to methodological problems, moment to moment variability of drivers, differences between drivers, and their interactions with the charac- teristics of the vehicle, road, and environment. Aspects of longitudinal and lateral vehicle control are discussed by reference to results of braking and steering tests, with emphasis on the variations between the performance of drivers. The effectiveness of drivers in vehicle braking is shown to be a function of the brake system deceler- ation/pedal force gain. Overall braking performance could also be improved by increasing the abilities of drivers who are poor in this task, by training in brake modulation on dry and wet pavements. The best drivers are as effective as an antilocking brake system, except on the equivalent of ice covered pavement. In steering control drivers increase their response frequency bandwidth as task difficulty increases. Comparisons are shown between an inexperienced and an experienced driver in curve negotiation up to the limit of control. 730018. Measuring Car-Driver Interaction with the g-g Diagram. R. S. Rice, Calspan Corp. Among the most pressing needs in the development of rational approaches for vehicle handling quality evalu- ation is a method for relating the driver's actions with the car's performance capability. This paper describes a concept which provides a graphic and objective meas- urement of this relationship, including the effect of road surface conditions on overall system behavior. Based on a continuous plot of the vector acceleration of the vehicle in the horizontal plane, the resultant figure, which is called a g-g diagram, is shown to be useful for characterizing the vehicle's envelope of performance, the variation of this envelope with tire-road surface conditions, the accessi- bility of various operating points to the driver in performing a task, performance margins utilized by the driver in normal operation, and for several other appli- cations. Experimental results from both proving ground and on-road tests are analyzed in terms of driver willingness limits, driver idiosyncracies, and task descrip- tions. It is shown that drivers usually employ healthy margins of performance on dry roads and that the normal modes of operation are predominantly along the axes (pure cornering, pure braking, and pure driving). Appli- cations of the method to handling studies, driver training, and general vehicle research and development are briefly described. 730019. What Are Machines Doing to Women? Lorna A. Middendorf, Oakland University. The purpose of this paper is to present information about females and their relationships with machines and to report female reactions to the machine component in the relationship. Since human factors engineering has focused largely on the male operator in the man-machine system, information concerned with female-machine relationships 81</page><page sequence="5">730020-730028 is derived mainly from studies of males. Several studies of females at work and a recent survey examine the role of the contemporary female as a machine user and record her reactions to this role. 730020. Form as a Visual Communicator. Leland W. Knight, Stanford University. This paper intends to show the importance of visual form in the human environment. Form is herewith defined as gross three-dimensional shape. From the viewpoint of a visual designer, form is treated as a discrete dimension - one that should be considered of equal importance with other functions in the design process. The reader is brought into contact with an area of design thinking that exists between the traditional form considerations of human factors - engineering (biomech- anics, ergonomics, etc.) and the purely aesthetic-artistic (taste, beauty, etc.). If we are to confirm "form as language," it will be necessary to understand how form communicates, and what is being communicated. This concept is presented in two parts: the first explores man-made objects and environments as examples of "how" and "what" form communicates; the second part probes vehicular design as a logical area for application of a form-value system. 730022. Decision Making in Dynamic Circumstances. Joseph Dumas, Oakland University. The research on cognitive processes can be usefully organized by considering the human decision maker to be a type of complex information handling system. By examining the characteristics of this system and com- paring it with other information handling systems, we gain some insight into its assets and limitations. The nature of these limitations have important implications for how the human information processor functions while driving an automobile. Experience, alertness, and familiarity were found to be necessary for the efficient functioning of this system in a driving environment. 730024. A Study of Automotive Energy-Absorbing Bump- ers. Hai Wu, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents an analysis of various energy- absorbing units for automotive bumper applications. It also introduces several general criteria concerning their design and performance to provide an analytical outline of the parameters involved. An example case of head-on impact between two vehicles with mass ratio of 1 :2 reveals the effect of heavy vehicle absorber design upon lighter vehicle damageability. 1973 SA E Transactions 730025. Urethane Energy Absorbers for Automobile Bumpers. Peter A. Weiler, Davidson Rubber Co. The purpose of the paper is to present concepts and data for the design and application of microcellular urethane form for absorbing energy in automobile bumpers. Of particular significance is the demonstration of tempera- ture compensation that overcomes the significant varia- tion in modulus with change in temperature that is characteristic of urethane. It is shown that by appropriate design techniques, peak force can be maintained constant even with variations in modulus as high as 6:1. Packaged absorbers, free energy blocks, and urethane faced bump- ers are discussed. 730026. Urethane Flexible Body Parts. Paul A. Haines, Jr., Inland Div., General Motors Corp. This paper discusses the current applications of urethane in flexible body parts which for 1973 cars has resulted in designs for bumper covers, bumper to body fillers, and body extensions. The flexible parts are color-keyed extensions of the body surface also matching the car body in luster and texture. Most importantly, they meet government requirements for bumper impact capability. There is a discussion of the tests established which included impact testing and compression recovery. The advantages and disadvantages of the cast-urethane pro- cess and injection-molded process are presented. 730027. An Energy Absorbing Elastomeric Bumper. Heinz Hintzen, Ford Motor Co.; and Raymond A. Dunleavy, Union Carbide Corp. Microcellular urethane, as facing for a fixed bumper, was established as functional material for reducing impact forces in low-speed vehicle collisions. The sharply in- creased modulus at low temperature typical of many urethane elastomers, a cause of high forces upon impact, was overcome in compounds developed during this project. An energy absorbing bumper of high aesthetic appeal is described, representing a first generation of development. This bumper design is capable of meeting the FMVSS 215 pendulum impact standards. Testing procedures and data reduction systems were developed to provide ready access to a large volume of test data. 730028. Painted and Color-Pigmented Elastomerics for Bumper Stone Deflectors. G. M. Wolf and E. P. DePalma, Ford Motor Co. Painted and color-pigmented elastomerics, specifically painted microcellular urethane and ethylene propylene terpolymer (EPDM), and painted and color pigmented vinyls are being employed extensively as highly flexible bumper stone deflectors on 1973 passenger vehicles built in the United States. The urethane parts are fabricated by a cast process; the EPDM is extruded, compression and injection molded; and the vinyls are extruded or injection molded. The urethanes and some vinyl are painted by conventional paint processes, whereas the EPDM is treated by a specific surface activation prior to painting. A wide range of colors, including metallics, are used to match the painted body to provide color continuity. On some vehicles, black, argents, and grey colors are employed where the stone deflector is not as highly visible or where a pleasing color contrast is desired. 82</page><page sequence="6">730029. A High Energy Level Pneumatic Energy Ab- sorbing Bumper. Jack E. Gieck and David A. Weitzenhof, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.; and Ernest J. Merz, Safety Consultant. A new concept in pneumatic energy absorbing bumper systems for motor vehicles has been developed, the dynamic testing of which demonstrates considerable promise in dissipating large blocks of energy in an accident situation. Having a flexible front section molded from a castable elastomer, the pressurized system is equipped with relief valves that open at a predetermined pressure during collision, thus dissipating energy. 1973 SA E Transactions 730030. Bumper Design, Materials, and Fabrication. R. R. Golze and R. F. Kienle, North American Rockwell Corp. This paper describes the methods taken to effect a step change in passenger car bumper design in order to meet Federal Standard 215, set forth by the Department of Transportation. The basic goal is to achieve a lightweight, low-cost bumper that is compatible with styling and durable enough to suffer little or no damage during impact at 5 mph (8 km/h). Three major areas - bumper design, materials, and fabrication - are treated separately and also as they interrelate. Boxlike sections, utilizing the face bar as an integral stressed member and judiciously employing beads and gussets, give best strength and stiffness. Materials should be of highest yield strength compatible with formability, and welded or bonded fabrication, approach- ing one-piece box construction, results in optimum structural properties. 730031. The 1973 General Motors Hydraulic-Pneumatic Energy Absorber Bumper System. Keith H. Carpenter and Lamar L. Kerr, Delco Products Div., General Motors' Corp. Energy absorber designs may store or dissipate energy. Storing implies a subsequent return of the impact energy in a rebound reaction (for example, springs). Dissipation can be either destructive - metal flow - or nondestructive - shearing of a working fluid. Automotive bumper systems are of maximum value from a performance and aesthetic standpoint only when at the design position, implying "self-restoration" after impact. This paper presents features of the General Motors energy absorber that dissipates impact energy and also self-restores. The paper also discusses the testing used to qualify the design for customer usage and compliance with federal standards on bumper systems. 730032. The 1973 Ford Impact Absorbing Bumper Sys- tem. John M. Slessor, Kenneth C. Rusch and Robert A. Pett, Ford Motor Co. The federal government requires that all 1973 passenger cars be capable of withstanding a 5 mph front bumper and 730029-730036 a 2.5 mph rear bumper fixed-barrier impact without damage to safety related components (lighting, latching, fuel, exhaust, cooling, propulsion, steering, and braking systems). Two basic ways in which the impact energy can be handled are: a thick flexible, external covering or large, flexible bumper guards attached to a rigid bumper-bar which is rigidly attached to the chassis by suitable supports; and a rigid reinforced bumper-bar attached to the chassis by means of compliant or compressible impact absorbing devices. While this general approach is used on most 1973 cars, the details of operation of the various systems are markedly different. Whereas some of the systems utilize fluid-flow through an orifice to absorb energy, Ford devices utilize shear deformation of rec- tangular rubber blocks. 730033. 1974 VW Energy- Absorbing Bumper System. U. Seiffert and P. Kirschner, Volks wagenwerk AG. The energy-absorbing bumper system designed for the 1974 Volkswagen in described. Theoretical requirements in bumper design are explained, with emphasis on bumper height, energy tolerance needs, energy absorption, and systems for absorbing the energy involved. The six systems studied are assessed, and the final design chosen is explained. The paper also compares bumper requirements as specified in Europe and the United States. 730035. Armored Reconnaissance Scout Vehicle Devel- opment Program. E. L. Birk, U. S. Army Tank- Automoti ve Command. The Scout vehicle program for the U. S. Army is performance oriented. The government has specified performance requirements only, and the successful con- tractor is responsible for designing a vehicle to meet them. The Scout system performance requirements fall into four primary areas - mobility, reconnaissance, firepower, and protection. The Scout program has been structured to take advantage of competitive prototyping. 730036. Experimental Investigation of Effect of Wheel Travel on Tracked Vehicle Mobility. Richard W. Siorek, U. S. Army Tank- Automotive Com- mand. This program attempted to consolidate data from several sources in an effort to isolate the contribution of wheel travel to overall vehicle mobility. Some definitive data are presented and described. The data indicate that wheel travel of 6-8 in will be capable of addressing 25% of the obstacles encountered, 14 in will address 55%, and 17 in will address 65%. It appears that 30-35 in of wheel travel, which would provide capability for addressing some 75% of encountered obstacles, is a maximum attainable level. This is subject to cost-effectiveness and vehicle config- uration constraints. The overriding conclusion is that wheel travel is an intertwined, indivisible vehicle char- acteristic that must be accompanied by other properly matched vehicle attributes, such as wheel base, spring rate, 83</page><page sequence="7">730037-730044 and damping rate, to attain its full potential. Test data from the Ml 13, PI Ml 13, and MICV were used in support of this evaluation and analysis. 730037. Results Derived from Soil-Vehicle Field Test Program of MEXA Design Vehicles. B. S. Schreiner, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers; and T. Czako, U. S. Army Tank- Au tomo ti ve Com- mand. The results of field tests of MEXA two wheeled and one tracked vehicles on soft-soil terrain and evaluation of vehicle performance are described in this paper. Design criteria are presented, and the systems used to meet these criteria - AMRB Mobility Index System, AMRB Numeric System for wheeled vehicles, and LLL Soil Value System - are described. Test sites and procedure are also described, and VCI test results are detailed. Experimental test results of the MEXA vehicles are compared with the design criteria and predicted performance of the actual vehicles. Speed test results are also discussed, as is the performance of MEXA vehicles articulated steering and inching systems in soft soils. 730038. Air Cushion Vehicle Operations in Arctic and Subarctic Terrain. Ronald A. Liston, U. S. Army Cold Regions Res. &amp; Engrg. Lab. The potential of air cushion vehicles for operation in arctic and subarctic terrain is discussed and critical problem areas identified. The various programs conducted by the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Labo- ratory to obtain solutions to the problems are presented. The programs include the development of terrain data significant to air cushion vehicle design and operation, the study of the effect of air cushion vehicle operations on terrain, and the study of the effect of the arctic and subarctic environments on the air cushion vehicle. 730039. (SP-374) The Truck Steering System from Hand Wheel to Road Wheel. John W. Durstine, Truck Operations, Ford Motor Co. This paper covers the subject of commercial vehicle manual and power steering system design and devel- opment from the total vehicle viewpoint. It includes a discussion on the interrelationship of cab package, front suspension, and tires on truck steering as well as a description of the pertinent steering system characteristics. The functions of the various steering system components are described as reference for system design and selection of industry available hardware for a specific application. The topics are presented in a manner which explains the logic of total steering system design from the initial stage of vehicle concept through the initial package proposal. 1973 SAE Transactions 730040. Metrication Impact in the Fluid Power Industry. J. I. Morgan, National Fluid Power Association; H. C. Parsons, Vickers Div., Sperry Rand Corp.; and H. Y. Smith, U.S. Army Mobility Equip- ment Res. &amp; Dev. Center. This three-part paper describes the experience of one industry - the fluid power - in the making of international standards through the International Standards Organi- zation. The first section outlines the National Fluid Power Association's approach to the problem, and the necessity for the industry to adopt the international standard of metric units, SI, as the language of measurement in the United States. With ISO/TC 131, Fluid Power Systems and Components, as an example, the second part describes the day-to-day workings of an ISO committee. Comments are made regarding the types of people who should make up the delegations to ISO meetings, and some of the problems they will encounter. The last section is written from an industrial supplier's viewpoint, and supplies several examples of how United States standards (specifically SAE's) are viewed by other delegations to ISO committees. The consensus is that international standardization is essential to all countries economic interests, and that the United States must participate strongly in the work of ISO if her industry is to remain competitive for the indefinite future. It is hoped that this description of the fluid power industry's experience in ISO will be helpful to other industries. 1973 SAE Transactions 730042. Pump Development - Selection of Design Con- cepts by Analysis. O. Langosch, Sperry Rand GmbH (Germany). The successful use of various hydraulic pump concepts is dependent on the specific requirements. The analysis of the basic pump designs allows a comparison of their strengths and weaknesses. As a result, some judgment criteria are presented to assist for selection of such design principles which offer acceptable compromises with a minimum number of different designs. This paper dis- cusses the advantages and disadvantages of capsular and piston pumps. 730043. Transient Over- Voltages in Alternator Systems. A. W. Winkley and M. J. Allport, Joseph Lucas (Electrical) Ltd. (England). Failure of electronic equipment in the alternator system will occur only under fault conditions. Overvoltage levels generated by the alternator and external equipment are discussed. Safe operation can be ensured by high voltage rating or by absorbing energy to reduce the transient voltage. These two methods are compared and transient energy measurements described. Problems in defining a precise specification for the necessary level of protection are stated and proposals made for an acceptable speci- fication based upon experience. 1973 SAE Transactions 730044. Generation and Suppression of Voltage Tran- sients in Military Vehicular Electrical Systems. 84</page><page sequence="8">730045-730048 Bernard Reich and John Erickson, U.S. Army Electronics Technology &amp; Devices Lab. Voltage transients generated in military vehicular elec- trical systems are being suppressed using a transient suppressor of considerable surge energy capability. This suppressor, a shunt type, is capable of absorbing 250 J in a 50 ms surge. The current and future increasing reliance on voltage-sensitive semiconductorized equipment makes it mandatory that transient protection be incorporated into nonmilitary automotive systems. Consideration is being given to equipping these nonmilitary automotive systems with high-energy surge suppressors. This paper describes transient suppressor developments at the U.S. Army Electronics Command; that is, suppressors used to protect tactical communications equipment. Emphasis is given to space, weight, and cost in the suppressor design. An approximate method is given for determining the sup- pressor surge capability which does not require a knowl- edge of the generating system impedence. The shunt suppressor requirements depend basically on the load being removed and the responsiveness of the generating system voltage regulator. Examples of voltage transients generated by military vehicular electrical systems are also presented. 1973 SA E Transactions 730045. Control of the Automotive Electrical Environ- ment. Gilman B. Andrews, Bendix Corp. The increasing use of electronics in automotive control and in measurement and display functions requires an examination of the automotive electrical power supply characteristics. This environment is characterized by voltage fluctuations, noise, and severe transients. Mis- handling and degradation of electrical components of the automotive power supply exaggerate these conditions. Electromagnetic interference arises from energy radiated from sources within and outside the vehicle. This paper presents some measurements of these types of electrical disturbances on contemporary automobiles and discusses the effect of the phenomena on the performance of electronic equipment. Causes for tem- porary and permanent degradation of electronic equip- ment are investigated, and a systems approach to the problem is recommended. Attention is drawn to possible improvements to the electrical environment, directed to the source of the various disturbances, as opposed to the present method of dealing with the disturbances at the interface between the power supply and each electronic package. 730046. Air-Cooled Rotary Engines - A Fuels and Lubri- cants Study. J. A. Russell, S. J. Lestz and J. T. Gray, Southwest Research Institute. Several MIL-L-2104C lubricants were evaluated in a small air-cooled rotary combustion engine, using leaded and unleaded gasoline. A 50 h endurance test was developed which discriminates lubricant quality on the basis of combustion chamber, spark plug, and side plate deposits. Additionally, use of unleaded fuel resulted in an eventual decrease in engine performance at approximately the 40 h mark. This is attributed to the character of apex and side seal groove deposits which caused seal spring binding and consequent blowby. The presence of sulfur in each fuel may also have an attenuative effect on such binding. 730047. Lubrication of the Wankel Rotary Engine. Georges J. Souillard and Frederic F. Van Quaethoven, Labofina S. A. The unique design of the Wankel rotary engine creates some special problems in lubrication. During our trials, we noticed that the best commercial motor oils for conventional 4-stroke engines are inade- quate for perfect lubrication of the Wankel rotary engine and do not obtain maximum mechanical performances on this type of engine. To lubricate the Wankel rotary engine, one part of the oil is injected in the air-fuel mixture, to lubricate the wall of the epitrochoid surface and the seals. Another part is circulated on the shaft bearings and is used to cool the rotor. In both cases, problems to solve are different, and the lubricant is necessarily a compromise to meet the different requirements. At this stage, the best lubricating oil is a synthetic mineral oil blend with an appropriate combination of additives. The synthetic oil is a petrochemical product made by polymerization of a monolefin C4 cut; the molecular weight is in the same range as the conventional mineral oils. With such a lube oil formulation, deposits in the combustion chamber are reduced to a minimum, avoiding preignition and seal sticking. Apex seal wear has been drastically reduced and engine life is longer. The performance of such a formulation has been tested in water- and air-cooled engines, on the bench and in the field. 730048. Lubricant and Fuel Requirements and General Performance Data of Wankel Rotary Piston Engines. R. D. Behling and E. Weise, BP Benzin und Petroleum A.G. This paper presents a discussion of the requirements and performance data of the relatively recently manufactured rotary piston (RP) engine. In comparison with the older reciprocating piston engine, the lower octane require- ments, lower NOx emission, and lower space and weight requirements are assets of the RP engine. Oil requirements and the wear problem are investigated; the RP engine has performed satisfactorily with conventional engine oils developed for reciprocating engines, and the wear prob- lem is largely solved. In order to prevent premature engine damage or failure, the preignition susceptibility of the RP engine must be reduced; possible solutions presented are: low content of ash precursors in the lubricant, selection of optimum base oil component, and design modifications. 85</page><page sequence="9">730049-730055 730049. Elastohydrodynamic Sealing Systems. J. D. Sy- mons, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. This paper sets forth the difference between standard sealing systems and elastohydrodynamic sealing systems and reviews a report on the latter prepared by a subcommittee of the SAE Transmission and Drivetrain Committee. An elastohydrodynamic sealing system requires a supplemental sealing device either on the seal itself or on the shaft. The paper describes unirotational and biro- tational seals for both types of design. It also discusses methods used in evaluating elastohydrodynamic seals, points out the limitations of each, and concludes by narrowing the field of suggested methods to three (visual examination of the seal on a plastic shaft, roll-coined spiral-grooved mandrel testing, and oil drop testing). 730050. Reducing Operating Temperatures of Elastomeric Sealing Lips. Leslie A. Horve, Chicago Rawhide Mfg. Co. The life of an elastomeric seal is highly dependent upon the temperature between the lip and the shaft. High temperatures will promote early failure if the limits of the material and/or sealing fluid are exceeded. A seal design with a sinuous or wave-like contact path on the shaft will substantially lower the interface tem- perature, thus promoting long life. In addition, the sinuous pattern provides a positive pumping action which im- proves seal reliability. The selection of wave parameters to give low-interface temperature with sufficient pumping ability to offset seal and shaft defects is discussed. Experimental data show the effect of seal design and wave parameters upon performance. 730051. Correlation of Physical Properties with Per- formance of Polyacrylate Radial Lip Seals at -30 F. John M. Brown and Richard C. Drutowski, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. This paper evaluates the tendency of lip seals to fracture in a test apparatus in which dynamic runout is 0.010 in and the temperature is cycled between -30 and 0 F. Seals made of eight different polyacrylate polymers were soap-sulfur cured with various types and amounts of carbon black. Physical tests included room-temperature flexibility defined by Young's modulus at small strains, standard tensile tests at room temperature, flexibility at sub-zero temperatures determined by a Gehman test, and sub-zero starting torques of the seals. Primary determinant of successful fracture resistance is a low starting torque resulting from good low-temperature flexibility. The effect of adding graphite to some of these formulations is described and some current commercially available seals are evaluated. 730052. TFE (Teflon) Radial Lip Seals. S. A. Sekulich, The Mather Co. Recent product designs and manufacturing developments involving TFE resins has provided an improved radial lip seal product for application engineers. The successful application of TFE radial lip seals is dependent upon a thorough understanding of the basic properties and functional characteristics of TFE resins, and in turn applying these criteria to the areas of product design and manufacturing methods. The TFE lip seal provides to the end user a sealing device that is compatible with virtually all fluids and additives, functional throughout a broad temperature range, and a low wear-rate enabling it to exceed today's required warranty periods. 730053. A Computer Simulation of a Spark Ignition Engine. G. G. Lucas and E. H. James, Lough- borough University of Technology (England). The mathematical model of the compression, combustion, and expansion phases of the IFF Renault variable compression ratio research engine reported here is an attempt to combine as many as possible of the basic characteristics of engine combustion. Finite rates of flame propagation and heat release are computed on the basis of Semenov's theory. To allow for the effects of turbulence, Semenov's estimate of laminar burning velocity is mul- tiplied by a term derived from flame speed measurements in the engine. Dissociation of the burned gases is compensated by chemical equilibrium and heat transfer data due to Annand. The computer model makes possible a parametric study of the effects of variables such as mixture compo- sition, spark timing, compression ratio, engine speed, and exhaust residuals that may determine a means of con- trolling certain obnoxious emissions resulting from use of propane, isooctane, and benzine fuels. Experimental data corroborate the accuracy of the model. 730055. Engine Valve Cooling. Louis J. Daniš, Valve Div., Eaton Corp. Design and manufacturing techniques have been develop- ed which make possible drastic reduction and precise control of poppet valve temperatures. For example, exhaust valves of revised design have operated 500-700 F (280-390 C) cooler than solid valves of conventional design. Direct benefits of temperature reductions of this magnitude could lead not only to increased valve and associated component durability, but also to reduced or eliminated hot-spot ignition. Valve cooling demonstrably provides better sealing of the combustion chamber during valve-closed events. Alloy cost in valves can be reduced, and metallurgical sophis- tication directed to the manufacturing process as well as to end use. Whether cooler valves can result in smoother com- bustion or permit higher compression ratios with unleaded fuels cannot as yet be determined in contemporary cylinder heads. Modifications would be required to permit more uniform and adequate coolant velocity around some 86</page><page sequence="10">730056-730065 valve guides which currently cannot manage stem heat rejection from super-conductive valves. 730056. Design of Engine Accessory Mounting Systems Subject to Large Vibrations. C. K. H. Dharan and D. W. Windstein, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents a systematic method for obtaining an acceptable mounting system for engine accessories in a short length of time with minimum redesign of metal components. A mathematical model is used to determine the various resonance conditions. Electronic instrumen- tation is used to verify the behavior of the system and determine amplitudes of vibration. Finally the endurance testing conducted to confirm analytical and experimental results is discussed. 730057. A Progress Report on Electromagnetic Activity of Motor Vehicle Manufacturer's Association. Ralph L. Kerrigan, Chrysler Corp. Starting in 1965 and continuing through 1972, the Radio Committee of the Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Asso- ciation (MVMA) has been the coordinator of a number of electromagnetic research projects. These investigations have included extensive applications of the updated SAE Standard, Measurement of Electromagnetic Radiation From Motor Vehicles (20-1000 MHz) - SAE J551a. Furthermore, there were joint testing programs with the Electronic Industries Association which encompassed measuring degradation in the performance of Land Mobile Radio Service receivers resulting from varying levels of impulsive-type radiation from motor vehicles. In addition, efforts were expanded in using statistical approaches for testing a number of hypotheses covering a conversion of impulsive vehicle noise data to the inter- ference potential to Land Mobile receivers. Information is provided on the objectives adopted in making the various studies, on how the testing programs were conducted, on the comparative advantages of different RFI measuring instruments, and on the scope and limitations of the results obtained. There are also descriptions with typical examples of the graphical methods used for the analysis of test results. 1973 SAE Transactions 730058. International Efforts to Control Radio Spectrum Pollution from Motor Vehicles. F. Bauer, Ford Motor Co. Electrical interference - both radiated and conducted - has grown manyfold in the last 15 years. These unwanted pulses are characteristically alike the world over, and in seriousness and difficulty of control are proportional to the standard of living and population density. International cooperation in control began in 1933, was interrupted by World War II, and has more recently accelerated and broadened in scope. The United States automotive industry is affected principally by international legislative restrictions on spurious radiations of radio energy from internal combustion engines. By virtue of its participation in international negotiations, the United States has made contributions to the international standard (CISPR Recommendation 18/2), has furthered uniform requirements, and has strengthened its own standard (SAE J551a). This paper describes the organization of CISPR, method of cross-pollenization between SAE and CISPR, and the status of various radio-interference projects now under study. 1973 SAE Transactions 730059. Inter-City and the Advanced Passenger Train. Paul Cautley, British Railways Board. Inter-City, brand name for its main line passenger services, is an important and growing part of British Rail. Since electrification, traffic growth has continued at a steady rate. To continue this development in the future, many improvements are planned for, including the use of Advanced Passenger Trains (A.P.T.) capable of speeds up to 160 mph. The basic concepts of the A.P.T., including aerodynamics, braking, etc., are discussed, as are its applications throughout the entire system. 730061. The Most Recent Developments in the Field of Very High Speeds in France - Electric Traction and Turbotrains. Marcel Tessier, French Na- tional Railroads (SCNF). Railroads are presently operating at speeds of 200-210 km/h in France and Japan. Recent research shows that commercial trains operating at 250 km/h are now a certainty, and that speeds of 300 km/h are possible. This paper describes SNCF's experience in operating and testing such trains. Modifications needed in track struc- ture, rolling stock, engines, electrical current collection, traction, aerodynamics, braking, and wheel-to-rail adhe- sion are discussed in detail. 1973 SAE Transactions 730063. Auto-Train Corporation - Concept, Development, Reality. Melvin F. Clemens, Jr., Auto-Train Corp. Auto-Train is the innovator of present auto-ferry or auto-on-train service in this country.

The importance of the passenger is being restressed - as opposed to the importance of the car, the plane, the highway, and the runway. The components have never been treated as an integrated system of transportation for the passenger. The existing subsystems are looked at, with a focus on the rejuvenation of updated high-speed travel by rail - the reality of Amtrak, expecially on the New York- Washington run. 730065. Total Energy Demand for Automobiles. Eric Hirst, Oak Ridge National Lab.; and Robert Herendeen, University of Illinois. 87</page><page sequence="11">730066-730073 Automobiles in the United States consumed about 66 billion gallons of gasoline in 1970, with an energy content of 8900 trillion Btu. Two-thirds of this fuel was devoted to urban travel, the remaining one-third to intercity driving. This automobile gasoline consumption accounted for 54% of the total United States transportation energy budget. Direct consumption of gasoline by autos is only part of the automotive energy picture. Indirectly - to manu- facture, sell, maintain, repair, insure, refine petroleum, and build highways for it - the automobile consumes about three-fifths as much energy as it does directly in gasoline, approximately 5500 trillion Btu in 1970. In- cluding both direct and indirect energy, the auto con- sumed 16,000 Btu/vehicle-mile that year. This is equal to 21% of the total United States energy budget. 730066. Energy Efficiencies of the Transport Systems. Richard A. Rice, Carnegie-Mellon University. Would a marked curtailment in allowable petroleum use seriously slow down present growth rates for transport activity? This paper explores a doubling of transport output in 25 years while holding oil consumption under the present 90 billion gal per year. By shifting some intercity and urban traffic to modified systems with better energy efficiency, high traffic volumes can still be moved. Surprisingly, if the right choices are made, personal vehicle ownership and auto travel could continue to increase, as could air travel; and actual door-to-door travel convenience could be maintained or improved. 1973 SA E Transactions 730069. New Modulating Remote Controls. Roderick F. Bailey, Moog Inc. Utility vehicles used in a high-voltage environment require modulating remote controls. These controls must provide the workmen with good control performance, and it is usually desirable that they maintain maximum dielectric strength, and have no mechanical problems. We believe control flexibility is maximized if the control function requires no mechanical interconnection between the controller and the maneuverable boom. This paper presents design considerations for our newest modulating remote control available and gives solutions to these problems. The use of a radio to control electrohydraulic proportional valves provides the most flexible control system available for utility vehicles. Five essential parameters are considered: dielectric strength, payload, mechanical take-up reels, control system per- formance, and control system reliability. Dielectric strength for the radio-controlled vehicle is a function of the fiberglass boom. Since there are no mechanical devices required through the boom for controls, many potential parallel dielectric leakage paths are eliminated. The boom tare weight is also reduced enabling the bucket truck user to have increased payload capability. Mechanical take-up reels for controls are eliminated. The control system performance using electrohydraulic proportional valves is extremely smooth, with resolution (threshold) of less than 2% of rated signal. System reliability is obtained by simplicity of design with a built-in security system to protect the radio from other radios and stray signals. Also included in the radio-controlled system is a redundant electrical control from the base station of the vehicle plus override capability. The system is totally secure and provides numerous failsafe features. 730070. Electrohydraulic Control of Aerial Lifts with Nonconductive Push-Pull Cables. Dale A. Knut- son, Applied Power Industries, Inc. Because of the unique control characteristics of electro- hydraulic proportional valves - smooth acceleration and deceleration, and the ability to inch or feather the work platform into position - several methods have been de- vised to use electrohydraulic valves to control electrically insulated aerial lifts. Since all components bridging the insulated portions of the boom structure must have an insulating value equivalent to the boom itself, it is not permissible to run electrical control cables from the work platform down the insulated boom to the control valves mounted on the chassis below. Systems using radio signals and light signals (via fiber optic bundles) are being developed to control the more complex, multifunctional aerial lift boom structures. This paper describes a relatively simple mechanical control system which bridges the insulated portion of the boom with nonconductive, flexible push-pull cables, and which was developed primarily for use on smaller, less complex aerial lifts. 730072. The Omni-Troll System - Tel-E-Lect Comput- erized Remote Control System. Robert Bonner and W. E. Wilson, Tel-E-Lect Inc. Omni-Troll, a device utilized in moon and space explo- ration, has a design that encompasses shock, vibration, sand and dust exclusion, temperature extremes, exclusion of moisture, protection against galvanic and environ- mental corrosions - criteria normally set down by the military services for mobile field electronic equipment. Integrated circuits, 1/16 X 1/16 in2 chips, having a jneantime-between-failure of 20,000,000 h, assure relia- bility over extended periods of time. 730073. Scale Model Experiments for Safety Car Devel- opment. B. Samuel Holmes and James D. Col- ton, Stanford Research Inst. Scale model tests are conducted to demonstrate the utility of modeling in the study of automobile impact problems. Specifically, the interaction of the bumper and energy- absorbing frame of an Experimental Safety Vehicle (ESV) during impact against a rigid pole at 50 mph is inves- tigated with one-eighth scale models of the ESV. The models duplicate the mass and energy-absorbing char- acteristics of the ESV and the materials and important construction detail of full-scale bumpers. Aluminum alloy and high-strength steel bumpers with equivalent full-scale 88</page><page sequence="12">weights from 48-146 lb are tested. Acceleration to 50 mph is provided by a pneumatic launcher; impact is recorded by high-speed cameras. Accuracy of the modeling technique is demonstrated by favorable comparison with full-scale experiments conducted by Ford Motor Co. The more extensive tests possible with the scale models show that the lightest successful bumpers are made of 7075-T6 aluminum and would weigh less than 64 lb in full scale. 1973 SA E Transactions 730074. Ford ESV Energy Management System. Klaus H. Arning, James R. Feustel and Alex Rhodes, Ford Motor Co. The Ford approach to ESV development was to attempt to meet government Experimental Safety Vehicle Program objectives by modifying a production vehicle by the use of materials and manufacturing processes suitable for mass production, and thereby hold cost increases to a reason- able level. This objective has not been met. However, improvements in vehicle structural integrity were accom- plished in the experimental vehicle, and valuable engi- neering information was obtained. The methods employed to achieve these improvements did not prove to be feasible for established mass production techniques. They were highly experimental in nature, prohibitive in cost, and resulted in a weight penalty of 32% over a current production Ford. The Ford ESV incorporated a special body-frame energy absorbing system designed to dissipate kinetic energy during a 50 mph barrier crash. The basic elements of the energy management system are a crushable frame, a controlled collapse fender apron structure, and hydraulic bumper struts. The system makes maximum use of available crush space while keeping the passenger com- partment deceleration as low as possible. 50 mph barrier crash testing of ESV prototypes verified the projected passenger compartment deceleration performance for the final concept and demonstrated improvements in pas- senger compartment integrity. 1973 SA E Transactions 730075. Small Vehicle Structural Design. Giuseppe Puleo, Fiat S.p.A. (Italy). The new passive safety requirements may well introduce radical changes in the criteria governing the design of car body structures. A meaningful picture of the onerous consequences which a rigid upholding of current trends could bring about in the small car class is offered by the results obtained during a research program conducted to study the structures of a 1200 lb class production car and a similar 1500 lb class Experimental Safety Vehicle (ESV). This paper illustrates the successive phases of the program (assessment and improvement of crashworthiness characteristics for the original 1200 lb car, development of a 1500 lb ESV) and gives technical data and details of the tests performed. 730074-730078 The conclusions emerging from the results of this research are somewhat alarming and anticipate serious threats to the very existence of the European small-size economy car. 1973 SA E Transactions 730076. Crash Dynamics and Structures of the Exper- imental Safety Vehicle Developed by General Motors. F. J. Bakewicz, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp., R. Chupick, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Corp., R. G. Fischer, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp.; and R. E. Roland, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. Development of the structures for an experimental safety vehicle by General Motors in compliance with Contract DOT-OS-00095 involved defining vehicle crash dynamics and relating structural characteristics to dummy occupant kinematics. Analytical tools were used to simulate vehicle crush characteristics, relate the crush/deceleration behav- ior to occupant kinematics, and simulate occupant behavior. A comprehensive test program was planned and final crashworthiness testing and validation were con- ducted. 1973 SA E Transactions 730077. Energy Absorption by Structural Deformation. Rene Larousse, S. A. Automobiles Citroen. Two forms of energy absorption are discussed in this paper. The first, mechanical reinforcement, is a prototype part, a guided sliding tube in a box-like structure, which acts as an additional buffer attached to the front frame extension of a small automobile. The second form, foam injection, is applied through hollow elements of sheet steel &lt;1 mm thick injected with rigid polyurethane foam. Laboratory tests have shown that it is unreasonable to consider impact speeds of more than 55 km/h for a loaded small vehicle, even after modification and reinforcement. Higher impact speeds would increase both weight and vehicle price, and increase occupant injury risk due to high deceleration within the vehicle. 730078. The Energy Management Structure for the Volkswagen ESV. H. Appel and J. Tomas, Volks wagenwerk AG. In order to improve the crashworthiness of vehicles, attention must be given both to an improvement of the occupant crash protection and to a reduction in the "aggressiveness" of heavy vehicles toward lighter vehicles. The latter requires a "soft nose" on the heavier vehicle. By use of hydraulic shock absorbers in the bumper system, an energy-absorption distribution can be achieved in vehi- cle-to-vehicle collisions without requiring larger defor- mations on the large vehicle than on the smaller vehicle. A theoretical investigation has been conducted con- cerning which type of hydraulic absorbers can best achieve the ideal weight-dependent layout of the frontal structure. A hydraulic absorber with a stroke-controlled 89</page><page sequence="13">730079-730082 throttle outlet area appears to be a suitable type. With this system, energy distribution in frontal impacts is attained and most of the energy is absorbed in the frontal structural of the impacting vehicle in rear and side collisions. The proposal for energy distribution and absorption achieved by weight and velocity dependent frontal crash behavior is tested and confirmed by means of experi- mental investigations within the scope of the Volkswagen experimental safety vehicle project. 1973 SA E Transactions 730079. Handling Characteristics of the General Motors Experimental Safety Vehicle. B. J. Finn, Engi- neering Staff, General Motors Corp., P. M. Riede, Proving Ground, General Motors Corp.; and A. E. Roller, Pontiac Motor Div., Generals Motors Corp. The Experimental Safety Vehicle (ESV) program in General Motors was a study in meeting the Department of Transportation performance requirements under Contract DOT-OS-00095. The ESV chassis was designed to meet or exceed the 1 1 contract specifications relating to accident avoidance, commensurate with subjectively good han- dling. This paper describes the use of a typical design process to achieve these goals, using existing technology. A linear vehicle directional control simulation was employed to determine design direction. A tire analysis program was the basis for reference tire characteristics emphasizing force and moment performance. A prelim- inary suspension design layout was prepared and a pretest car was constructed. Development of this vehicle using various supplier tire submittals generated suspension information for the final design. An acceptable tire construction was selected from various tire supplier submittals and specified for the prototype vehicles. The suspension, steering and level control systems are de- scribed. Tests on a fully instrumented prototype indicated compliance with all specifications except low speed (25 mph) returnability. In actual driving, however, the returnability at all speeds was subjectively rated accept- able. Test methods and results are included. Discussion: C. M.

This paper describes the vehicle dynamic test results for the experimental safety vehicles delivered by AMF, Inc., and Fairchild Industries to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in January 1972. These test results are concerned primarily with the braking and steering ability of the vehicles and were derived from the early feasibility studies (Phase I studies) that originate within the NHTSA (then called NHSB) in early 1968. From these studies and a subsequent test program, performance specifications were written for the AMF and Fairchild Industries contracts. 730081. Development of the Brake System for the Gen- eral Motors Experimental Safety Vehicle. W. J. Oakley, Delco Moraine Div., General Motors Corp., A. E. Roller, Pontiac Motor Div., General Motors Corp.; and W. J. Cattin, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. The Experimental Safety Vehicle program in General Motors was a study in meeting the Department of Transportation performance requirements, with the sole objective being to meet or exceed all of the contract specifications. This vehicle was not intended for produc- tion; it was a safety idea car with many unique features including a four-wheel, anti-lock disc brake system using a hydraulic power brake system with an electro-hydraulic back-up system. In addition, the design of the dual piston caliper for the disc brakes provides a redundant system thereby minimizing the effect of a single line or hose failure. This feature coupled with the redundant back-up power brake system provided performance under various failed conditions approximately equal to the original effectiveness with only a slight increase in pedal effort. This brake system, developed for the ESV, satisfied the General Motors performance objectives, and equaled or surpassed the contract requirements of the ESV program. 730082. Combustion Chamber Gas Temperatures by a Benzene Light-Absorption Technique. W. W. Haskell, D. K. Trumpy and C. H. Hendrickson, Shell Development Co. Several techniques have been presented in the literature for measuring mixture temperatures in internal combus- tion engines during the compression process up to the time of knock. This paper describes a new method based on the light-absorbing properties of benzene vapor and presents engine data based on this technique. The utltraviolet light absorption coefficient of benzene vapor has been measured over a temperature range of 300-1400 K (80-2060 F). This absorption coefficient, which is very sensitive to temperature, is a function of temperature to the eighth power at room temperatures and decreases smoothly to a fourth power function at approximately 1000 K (1340 F). The extreme sensitivity of the absorption coefficient to temperature allows precise determination of gas temper- atures during the early part of the compression process in a Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine and through- out compression of the fuel/air mixture. The data quantitatively support an analytical prediction that heat transfer from the chamber wall to the inlet mixture, during the intake stroke, causes increased compression temper- ature histories.

A Preliminary Model for the Formation of Nitric Oxide in Direct Injection Diesel Engines and Its Application in Parametric Studies. S. M. Shahed and W. S. Chiù, Cummins Engine Co., Inc.; and V. S. Yumlu, Mack Trucks, Inc. A semiempirical, mathematical model describing the formation of nitric oxide in direct-injection diesel engines is derived. The model is used in conjunction with injection and thermodynamic cycle simulation programs. This approach enables prediction of nitric oxide emissions from design dimensions and operating parameters only, without the use of experimental data. Predicted results are compared with experiments for typical naturally aspirated and turbocharged engines. The accuracy of prediction is very good except under lightload naturally aspirated conditions. The model is used in an extensive parametric study, together with experimental verification. The agreement between prediction and experiments is excellent, except under conditions of excessive smoke or of high swirl. Discussion: L. J.

Karim, University of Calgary (Canada); and I. A. Ali, Ahmadu Bello University (Nigeria). Operating characteristics including ignition limits, cyclic variability, and exhaust emissions were studied in the combustion of natural gas in a spark ignition, single- cylinder, variable compression ratio engine, operated at intake mixture temperatures ranging between 120 and -60 F. The work confirmed in general the feasibility of using natural gas in a spark ignition engine operated under extremely cold intake temperature conditions. It was learned that both the maximum peak cylinder pressures and the mass of mixture inducted by the engine increased as the intake mixture temperature was lowered, and that the emissions of pollutants were not significantly in- creased. These findings are thought to be particularly relevant to the use of natural gas in spark ignition engines, either as LNG or under very cold wintry conditions. 730085. Measurement of the Extent of Abnormal Com- bustion by Means of an External Device. G. M. Cornetti, V. Arrigoni, F. Sezzi and G. F. Zanoni, SNAM Progetti (Italy). The detection of cyclic dispersion, knocking, preignition, misfiring, and other phenomena related with abnormal combustion in spark ignition engines has been extensively studied in the past. The transducers most commonly used detect pressure and/or ionization in the combustion chamber. By employing transducers that detect engine head movement it has been possible to examine these phe- 730083-730087 nomena without particular engine modifications, thus enabling measurements to be made in commercial cars. These transducers are used in conjunction with electronic apparatus that gives quantitative measurements of the extent of the abnormal combustion. Results obtained by these means are reported with particular emphasis on high speed knock (a problem presently encountered with European cars), preignition and misfiring. On the basis of the test results a technique is developed utilizing the electron scanning microscope to recognize a posterior if the piston failure is due to knock or preignition.

Winsor and Donald J. Patterson, University of Michigan. Cyclic combustion variations were studied in a single- cylinder CFR engine with a pancake combustion cham- ber. Variations in the combustion duration were shown to be related to mixture velocity and its variations through a simple model. This model postulates a critical flame radius increment in which mixture motion variations near the spark electrodes create the cyclic combustion varia- tions. From experimental measurements, the critical flame radius increment in this engine was found to be about 0.4 in. The mixture motion measurements were made with a hot-wire anemometer in the engine motored without fuel. A new calibration and calculation technique was develop- ed in order to obtain velocities from the anemometer output in the varying temperature and pressure envi- ronment of the engine. Tests were run at full and part load over the speed range of 500-1500 rpm. It was found that near tdc the turbulence in the engine was isotropic and the turbulent velocity increased linearly with engine speed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730087. Relationship of Flame Front Pattern to Pressure and High-Speed Knock on Commercial Engines. P. Chiampo, F. de Cristofaro and R. Gozzelino, Fiat S.p.A. The combustion chamber of a typical commercial engine was equipped with pressure and ionization gap trans- ducers to determine the pressure and flame front pattern. The signals from the transducers were displayed on a oscilloscope screen and recorded by means of moving pictures shot with a speed-adjustable camera. The nec- essary data were obtained by measuring the parameters on the single frames which show the combustion cycles, and they were subsequently processed. The results refer to correlations between pressure values and flame front pattern, considerations on flame front behavior and origin of knock phenomenon, and the existence of statistically different behavior between knocking and nonknocking combustion cycles. 91</page><page sequence="15">730088-730094 730088. Turbulent Flame Structure as Determined by Pressure Development and Ionization Intensity. V. Arrigoni, F. Calvi, G. M. Cornetti and U. Pozzi, SNAM Progetti (Italy). Two main properties distinguish the structure of a turbulent flame from that of a laminar flame: ionization current of high intensity and high burning velocity. The first of these two quantities was directly measured in the combustion chamber of a typical European spark ignition engine by means of a Langmuir's probe, while the second was calculated starting from the pressure-time history measured with a piezoelectric transducer. The experi- mental results show the strong influence of the initial flame propagation on the type of the subsequent com- bustion during the rest of the cycle. The mathematical elaboration of the experimental data showed that the flame propagation mechanism is consistent with the hypothesis that turbulent combustion is caused by successive self-ignitions, as suggested by Russian authors. Useful information can be obtained from the measure- ment method used in this work on the quality and quantity of the ions that are the precursors of some of the most interesting pollutants found in the exhaust stream of a spark ignition engine.

Karim, The University of Calgary; and M. E. Taylor, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. A preliminary investigatìòn was made into the use of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures in spark ignition engines. This appeared to be attractive in view of the serious air pollution problem. Furthermore, hydrogen has been considered by others as a possible alternative fuel to replace depleting petroleum resources. Following a literature survey regarding the combus- tion characteristics of hydrogen, a computer program based on a constant-volume combustion engine cycle was used to evaluate the overall performance of an engine. Another program, which considered chemical reaction kinetics, was used to predict the onset of autoignition in mixtures undergoing compression in an engine. Results of the programs indicated that an attractive and safe way to use hydrogen-oxygen mixtures in an engine involved the recycling of exhaust gases. Such a system would be fed with a stoichiometric mixture, while excess hydrogen would be circulated within to control combustion in the engine. Water vapor would be con- densed from the exhaust gases and would be the only product leaving the system. 730090. An Investigation of Serial Choice Reaction Time as the Basis for an Alcohol Interlock. Edward D. McDowell and George L. Smith, Jr., The Ohio State University. The studies reported herein investigate the feasibility of using a serial choice reaction time (SCRT) task as the basis for an alcohol ignition interlock. The two measures of performance used are the total time to complete the task plus the number of errors (TTC), and the number of response times exceeding 1.1s duration plus the number of errors (PS). Both measures are found to increase in proportion to the square of the blood alcohol level (BAL) with the PS measure increasing more rapidly. A sequential criteria task that minimized task duration «7 s) is proposed. This task would reject approximately 30% of the subjects at 0.10% BAL while only failing 1% when sober. SCRT tasks show promise as a basis for an ignition interlock. It was concluded that additional work is indicated. 730092. The Influence of Alcohol and Marijuana on a Manual Tracking Task. L. D. Reid and M. K. F. Ibrahim, University of Toronto; R. D. Miller and R. W. Hansteen, Commission of Inquiry Into Nonmedical Use of Drugs. Two projects have been carried out to determine the usefulness of employing human operator describing functions in the study of the influence of alcohol and marijuana on subjects performing a visual-manual control task. Significant alterations in the linear operator models were observed and interpreted as changes in the time delay, neuromuscular system, and operator noise injec- tion. The results provide the basis for a linear model capable of describing the dynamic response of human operators while under the influence of the two drugs. 730093. Alcohol Impairment Detection by the Phystester - Evaluation Program Summary. Trevor O. Jones and Jean A. Tennant, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. The Phystester, an ignition interlock system based on a predriving performance test, is evaluated. Results and observations from programs conducted by General Mo- tors and other independent organizations are analyzed. The sensitivity of the psychomotor task offered by the Phystester to blood alcohol concentration, performance asymptoticity through distributed training, age, intelli- gence, drinking habits, sex, and digital dexterity is quantified. Performance on the Phystester task is shown to be significantly correlated with blood alcohol concentration and with performance on simulated driving tasks. The Phystester is shown to be capable of discriminating between sober and intoxicated individuals, the intoxicated rejection rate being dependent on the magnitude of the acceptable sober rejection rate. 1973 SA E Transactions 730094. Alcohol and Drug Impairment of the Driver. Herbert Moskowitz, University of California at Los Angeles. Alcohol impairment of driving skills appears to be due to the information processing demands of a divided attention 92</page><page sequence="16">task. Driving is characterized as a divided attention skill involving two major task components: compensatory tracking and search-and-recognition for environmental signals. Support for this position is offered from labo- ratory and simulator studies as well as epidemiological data. There is scant epidemiological evidence regarding marihuana effects on driving, but laboratory data are reported. Alcohol and marihuana effects differ, and it is concluded that effects of marihuana on performance are not related to division of attention and information processing rate. It is suggested that marihuana is less dangerous to the driving tasks than is alcohol, for the dose levels tested. A tentative hypothesis as to the nature of the marihuana effect is offered. 730095. A Critical Tracking Task as an Alcohol Interlock System. Jean A. Tennant and Richard R. Thompson, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. A compensatory tracking task (the Critical Tracking Task) requiring the operator to stabilize the output of an unstable system whose level of instability increases monotonically up to the critical point of loss of control is evaluated for its potential to discriminate between sober and intoxicated performances. Quantification of the results obtained in the labo- ratory controlled environment shows a great deal of promise, indicating that intoxicated failure rates of 50% for blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) at or above 0.1% and 75% for BACs at or above 0.14% can be attained with no sober failure rates. A high initial rate of learning is observed, perhaps due to the very nature of the task whereby the operator is always pushed to his limit, and the scores approach a stable asymptote after approximately 50 trials. Finally, the implementation of the task as an ignition interlock system in the automobile environment is discussed. It is pointed out that lower critical performance limits are anticipated for the mechanized automotive units because of the introduction of larger hardware and neuromuscular lags. Whether such degradation in performance would reduce the effectiveness of the device or not will be determined in a continuing program involving a broader based sample of the driving population and performance correlations with both BACs and driving proficiency. 730097. Solid-State Breath Alcohol Vehicle Interlock System. V. R. Brown, G. R. Jindal and E. Jo, Environmental Metrology Corp. Most modern breath alcohol analyzers are based on wet chemical colorimetry techniques. This paper describes work based on solid-state sensor technology, which accepts alveolar breath samples only. A device that prevents legally intoxicated persons from interlocking the ignition system and operating a motor vehicle when a breath alcohol level exceeds the preset level is described. The device automatically analyzes the candidate opera- 730095-730100 tor's breath without requiring him to perform any operation other than normal breathing. 730098. Measurement and Interpretation of Driver Steer- ing Behavior and Performance. David H. Weir and Duane T. McRuer, Systems Technology, Inc. Models have been developed to describe the dynamic response and performance of drivers, vehicles, and driver-vehicle systems; and recent experiments have provided some quantification and refinement. This paper summarizes the theory and the data, and attempts to provide part of the transition between properties of the human and the assessment of safety performance in driving. The model and data shown emphasize steering or directional control situations. Simulation experiments with random crosswind gust disturbances were used to measure driver-vehicle describing functions for a number of driver subjects and experimental replications. The results are consistent with previous data and show good repeatability within subjects on successive runs. Inter- pretation of the data in terms of the driver-vehicle model indicates that the driver's outputs can be explained in simplest terms as functions of lateral position and heading. The results demonstrate that driver-vehicle system dynamic response properties can be modeled and measured for a class of important driving tasks. They also provide direct experimental verification of the applica- bility of driver-vehicle theory for situations where the driver obtains his information from a real-world visual simulation. 730099. Alcohol-Induced Degradation of Performance on Simulated Driving Tasks. Robert C. Sugarman, C. Paul Cozad and Albert Zavala, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. Using the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory Driving Simulator, performance on position maintenance (lane- keeping), speed maintenance, and reaction time was measured for 159 subjects as they passed through various levels of intoxication over a 7 h period. Using normalized scores for each individual subject to correct for idio- syncratic extreme behaviors, significant correlations were found between Breathalyzer readings and performance on each of the simulated driving tasks. Significant corre- lations were also found between each pair of simulated driving task measures. 730100. Glass-Ceramic Hexagonal and Circular Passage Surfaces - Heat Transfer and Flow Friction Design Characteristics. A. L. London, Stanford University; and R. K. Shah, Harrison Radiator Div., General Motors Corp. Heat transfer and flow friction design characteristics are presented for some "second-generation" glass-ceramic heat exchanger surfaces. These surfaces are of interest in their application as the matrix for the rotary regenerator of the vehicular gas turbine engine. 93</page><page sequence="17">730101-730113 This paper gives the results for four test matrices, with 550-1650 ft2/ft3 area densities. Two matrices had hex- agonal cross-sectional passages and two had circular passages. Test results, derived by the single-blow transient technique, are compared with predictions from laminar flow conduction theory. Flow Reynolds numbers are in the range 80 &lt; Re &lt; 1000. These surfaces have some advantages over the cur- rently employed triangular passage geometry. The sig- nificance of these advantages in terms of the regenerator thermal performance and envelope geometry is discussed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730101. Metal Peeling of Stainless Steel Foil for Gas Turbine Regenerators. Charles W. Vigor, Re- search Labs., General Motors Corp.; and William Leibring, Harrison Radiator Div., Gen- eral Motors Corp. Heat exchanger materials are a significant part of the cost of the regenerative gas turbine engine. This is especially true of the metal regenerator because of the price premiums for stainless steel foil. To circumvent high foil costs, General Motors Corp. has devised a foil production process called metal peeling. The process consists of cutting a thin metal chip from a large metal billet. Peeled foil is low cost because capital equipment costs are low, less labor is involved, and costly in-process heat treat- ments are not . required. 1973 SA E Transactions 730102. The Effects of Multiplane Balancing on Flexible Rotor Whirl Amplitudes. Robert H. Badgley, Mechanical Technology Inc.; and Neville F. Rieger, Rochester Institute of Technology. Influence coefficient balancing of an advanced gas turbine rotor in fluid-film bearings with nonsymmetrical properties has been examined. The effect of the number of balancing planes in use on the quality of balance has been studied with particular attention being paid to the reasons why an increase from three planes to four planes gives no apparent improvement. Effects examined include the influence of nonsymmetrical bearing properties, the effect of having a bending critical speed close to either side of the intended operating speed, and the effect of correction weight errors on balance quality. Reasons why the addition of a fifth balancing plane resulted in a significant improvement in balance quality are given. 730103. Inertia Welding. T. L. Oberle, Caterpillar Trac- tor Co. Friction welding is a solid-state bonding process. When the energy for a friction weld is supplied by a rotating flywheel the process is called inertia welding. Inertia welding is characterized by short weld time, high power, and a dwell period of low torque followed by quite high torque which contributes to interface forging at the end of the weld. The low-torque state of inertia welding is attributed to adiabatic shear. The flywheel adds versatility to the friction weld process by supplying power to the interface as demanded by the material, by the size and shape. There is a minimum speed for inertia welding of any material. This speed is equated to the physical properties of the material - namely, the thermal conductivity, density, specific heat, and melting temperature. Excellent welds between similar or dissimilar materials are obtained by means of this process, as shown by fatigue data. 730107. Automotive AM-FM-MPX Radio Reliability. M. L. Barnett and L. Kukla, The Bendix Corp. The requirements for reliability of an automotive AM- FM-MPX receiver are discussed from four viewpoints: environment, design, manufacture, and quality-reliability assurance. Methods by which high reliability may be achieved and factors which influence multiplex radio reliability are discussed. Although much progress has been achieved, it is realized that even greater reliability is required, and the future trends for reliability improve- ments are presented. 730109. Technology Assessment - How Did We Get Here? Were Are We Now? Where Are We Heading? Gabor Strasser, Battelle Memorial Institute. In 1972, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was created within the Congress of the United States. This paper discusses conditions leading to this creation, assesses the present situation, and speculates about the future. The composition of the Technology Assessment Board is described, and the author's prerequisites for a successful OTA are presented. 730111. Technology Assessment/Highways and the En- vironment. Stuart L. Hill, Barton-Aschman As- sociates, Inc. This paper relates the notion of technology assessment to the impact studies that have been conducted on highway projects in the last several years. It describes a few of the lesser known secondary social impacts of highway projects in urban areas, and asserts that the evaluation of secondary consequences will identify secondary oppor- tunities to optimize project achievement. 730113. Machinability as Influenced by the Composition, Microstructure, and Cold Extrusion of Steel. P. T. Aylward, Bethlehem Steel Corp. The relationship of machinability to the carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, and other alloy contents of cold- drawn steels is discussed. Two useful measures of machinability are provided by procedures which relate the solid-solution hardening effects of the alloying elements to carbon equivalents in hot-rolled steels, and the eutectoid- carbon lowering effects of the alloys to microstructures in annealed steels. Finally, attention is directed to the fact that cold working by extrusion improves the machinability of low-carbon steel. 94</page><page sequence="18">730114. Effect of Additives on the Machinability and Properties of Alloy-Steel Bars. H. J. Tata and R. E. Sampsell, U. S. Steel Corp. Research programs were conducted to select the free- machining additive that would greatly increase the machinability of AISI 8620- and 4 140- type steels without adversely affecting their hot workability, chemical ho- mogeneity, and mechanical and metallurgical properties. The additives investigated were sulfur, selenium, tellur- ium, lead, and bismuth. The principal findings were as follows: 1. Selenium and tellurium were more effective in increasing machinability than were the other additives. 2. Tellurium, even in small amounts, greatly increased scrap loss and conditioning loss. 3. The potent effect of selenium on machinability was obtained with pearlite, bainite, and tempered martensite microstructures. 4. The hardenability, impact properties, fatigue prop- erties, and case-hardening characteristics of steels contain- ing sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and lead were about the same. On the basis of these studies, it is concluded that selenium is the optimum additive, and that the machina- bility of 8620- and 4 140- type steels containing nominally 0.10% selenium is superior to that of commercially available 8620 and 4140 free-machining steels. 1973 SA E Transactions 730115. Calcium Deoxidized Improved Machining Steels for Automotive Gears. V. A. Tipnis, R. A. Joseph and J. H. Doubrava, Republic Steel Corp. A new family of improved machining gear steels has been developed using calcium deoxidation. Using these steels, the rougher and finisher cutter tool life during gear cutting on automotive differential drive pinions and ring gears has been improved by as much as 70-100%. Currently, calcium deoxidized steels are being used by many automotive gear and axle plants on a production basis and have realized similar improvements in cutter life with resultant sub- stantial cost savings and productivity gains. These calcium deoxidized steels are fine grained and exhibit identical hardenability, carburizing, and heat treat response as that of the conventional Al-Si deoxidized steels. The mechanical properties such as impact strength, tensile strength, ductility, and fatigue resistance of the calcium deoxidized steels are essentially the same as those of the conventional Al-Si deoxidized steels. The application of calcium deoxidized steels for carburizing as well as through-hardening grades for transmission gears, steering worms, as well as pinion and ring gears used in trucks, tractors, and off-the-road equipment also shows promise of substantial gains in tool life with resultant cost savings and productivity gains. 730116. An Assessment of the Variability in Machining Behavior in Low Carbon Resulphurized Free- 730114-730119 Machining Steels. R. W. Thompson, M. D. Coward and B. S. Levy, Res. Labs., Inland Steel Corp. An assessment has been made of the variability in machining characteristics in several grades of low carbon resulphurized steels. Variability results from the influence of processing on structural features such as the sulfide inclusion morphology, the extent and type of solid solution strengthening and the amount and distribution of special additives such as lead and tellurium. Close control of ferro alloy and scrap composition, deoxidation, casting temperature, lead and tellurium addition practices, and reheat and rolling temperatures are utilized to minimize variability in the machining behavior of free-machining steels. 730117. An Evaluation of the Potential Performance Gain from Leakage Reduction in Rotary Engines. Meinrad K. Eberle and Edward D. Klomp, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. A brief description is given of a rotary engine analytical model which permits calculation of apex- and side-seal leakage. This model was used in conjunction with experimental results for the purpose of estimating the relative importance of apex- and side-seal leakages. Comparing analytical and experimental results, an esti- mate is made of the potential gain to be expected through leakage area reduction at both wide open throttle (WOT) and road-load operating conditions. 1973 SA E Transactions 730118. A Critical Analysis of the Rotary Engine Sealing Problem. H. F. Prasse, H. E. McCormick and R. D. Anderson, TRW Piston Ring Div. This paper compares the desirable and undesirable characteristics of the rotary engine as an automobile power plant. It is pointed out that in order for the engine to become an inexpensive automobile powerplant, certain seal design parameters should be changed to reduce tolerances required and to eliminate the costly, difficult- to-machine coatings on the trochoid and end-housing running surfaces. An analysis of the loads on the apex seal has been made and design parameters set up for a material to eliminate, or greatly reduce, the well-known chatter problem. The authors have analyzed the geometry of the side compression and oil seals and propose changes in geometry and design of the seals to allow for automated assembly procedures. 730119. Outboard Marine Corporation's Production Ro- tary-Combustion Snowmobile Engine. Harry M. Ward, III, George E. Miller and Donald K. Stephenson, Outboard Marine Corp. In September 1972, Outboard Marine Corp. put into production the first rotary combustion (RC) engine manufactured in the western hemisphere. All design, development, manufacturing, and assembly is done within 95</page><page sequence="19">730120-730125 the corporation. The paper discusses many of the design concepts, and design considerations for the snowmobile application. Cooling, one of the most difficult obstacles for air-cooled, charge-cooled engines, is covered in some detail. Engine performance, lubrication, noise control, and the capacitive discharge ignition system are also de- scribed. Finally, internal inspection methods unique to the RC engine are explained. 1973 SA E Transactions 730120. Developments in Measuring Fatigue Impairment. Leslie Buck, National Research Council of Canada. Research into factors associated with the development and alleviation of fatigue presuppose a means of meas- uring performance impairment. The National Research Council of Canada has been developing a test of psychomotor performance, known as a stressalyser, which gives scores that are variant with fatigue as indicated by prolonged sleep loss. The test is short but interesting, and the apparatus is compact and portable, and the method offers possibilities of application to problems like the design of working regimes for long distance truck drivers. 730121. Drowsiness and Driving: Preliminary Report of a Population Survey. D. H. Tilley, C. W. Erwin and D. T. Gianturco, Duke University. This paper reports the results of a population survey on drowsiness and driving. The study was designed to test the hypotheses that drowsiness at the wheel is a behavioral phenomenon experienced by a significant portion of the driving population, and that it is a contributing causal factor in vehicular accidents. The questionnaire, asked of 1500 applicants for license renewal, is reproduced in this paper, and frequency distribution of answers by percentage is presented. Responses to several questions were also arrayed across demographic and personal characteristics of the popu- lation. 730122. Psychophysiologic Indices of Drowsiness. C. W. Erwin, M. R. Volow and B. Gray, Duke University Medical Center. The phenomenon of drowsiness and sleep during vehicle operation was first studied by noting the normal occur- rence of sleep in an appropriate environment. As the individual passes through the stages of wakefulness and sleep, many psychological variables change. This paper reports the electroencephalographic and skin potential changes as related to wakefulness and sleep. 730123. Drowsiness and Driving in a Middle Aged Population. Daniel Gianturco, Dietolf Ramm and William Erwin, Duke University Medical Center. A population of middle aged and older drivers was screened for physical problems or psychological traits that might predispose the individuals toward difficulties in staying alert while driving. Identification of these prob- lems is an important first step to a successful study. A small questionnaire was used, the results of which are reported. The method and results of the study are described, followed by a discussion of the data findings. Conclusions find the drowsiness incidence high in these older groups. Use of the Cattell personality tests revealed no consistent correlations. 730124. The Heart Rate Variability Correlates of Spon- taneous Drowsiness Onset. M. R. Volow and C. W. Erwin, Duke University. The disturbingly high estimate of single vehicle auto- mobile accidents felt to be drowsiness-related has sug- gested the need for physiologic or behavioral alertness indicators. This experiment is one phase in the systematic evaluation of the reliability of heat rate variability (HRV) as such an indicator. Nine subjects became spontaneously drowsy in a passive laboratory situation, while heart rate (HR), EEG, and other physiologic measurements were recorded for 1 h. Beat-to-beat heart activity in 40 s of waking record was compared with heart activity in 40 s of adjacent drowsy record, using electrographic definitions of waking and drowsy (transitional) states. Of three descriptors of heart activity, HRV only as measured by the mean square of HR, showed an inverse, but marginal- ly significant and unreliable relationship to drowsiness onset. Neither HR nor HRV measured by mean square of successive differences of HR showed any relationship to drowsiness onset at all. We conclude that HRV is not a reliable predictor of spontaneous drowsiness onset in the passive laboratory situation. 730125. Vehicular Radar Speedometer. Tom M. Hyltin and Troy D. Fuchser, Texas Instruments, Inc.; H. Blair Tyson and William R. Regueiro, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Certain problems associated with conventional vehicular speed sensing such as wheel slip, wheel lock and variable rolling radius can be alleviated by employing microwave speed sensing. It is expected that true speed sensing will augment a number of automotive and other ground transportation applications. An experimental, two-horn 55 GHz CW radar speed- ometer designed to measure true ground speed in the presence of vehicular perturbations is described herein with an ultimate design frequency of 60 GHz. An IMPATT-diode, solid state transmitter was incorporated in this design because of its inherent advantages. The RF portion of the transmitter-receiver (TR) unit, including the dipol feed is housed on a single microstrip circuit, on an alumina substrate V2 X l/4 in (12.7 X 6.35 mm). Vertically polarized beams, incident at angles of 35 F with respect to the horizontal were chosen as a design compromise. This experimental system, designed to measure speeds up to 100 mph, was incorporated on a vehicle for testing to determine its performance in a typical environment. 96</page><page sequence="20">The results obtained demonstrated the concept and point towards further development required to make this device more applicable to the problems at hand. 1973 SA E Transactions 730126. The Feasibility of a Car Central Computer. Frank P. Caiati and James F. Thompson, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. The challenge of designing a computer centered control system for a car involves traditional feasibility consid- erations with a unique emphasis on problems of high volume production of multiple models with stringent safety and reliability requirements. Recent GM efforts in computer system development on a series of Alpha vehicles have allowed evaluation of a number of system configurations. Continuing tradeoff studies and design iterations are necessary to optimize a'currently favored approach. Work to date confirms that the car central computer, though feasible, needs further work to achieve practicality. 730127. An Automatic Driving System of Automobiles by Guidance Cables. Toshihiko Ito and Masaharu Furumata, Japan Automobile Research Insti- tute, Inc.; Fumio Harashima and Hiroshi Inaba, University of Tokyo; and Shuntetsu Matsumoto, Mechanical Engrg. Lab., Japanese Government. The authors developed an automatic driving system capable of controlling a motor vehicle along a guidance cable. Fabricated with fully electrical components, the equipment has a very simple and reliable structure and could be made at a low cost. The test results were successful. The course deviations were within 20 mm in steady-state running for speed ranging 20-100 km/h. The riders in the vehicle felt fairly comfortable. The system is going to be used for driverless tests of automobiles, and it is also expected to be applied for the dual-mode system. 730128. Digitally Programmed Engine Fuelling Controls. J. P. Soltau, K. B. Senior and B. B. Rowe, Joseph Lucas (Electrical) Ltd. The paper describes briefly the fuel control possibilities in an injection system fitted to an otto cycle engine. Whatever arrangement is chosen, it must be able to measure accurately the airflow to the power unit. For a particular engine and at a given engine speed, the throttle angle will indicate directly the air being aspirated per unit time. Thus a control following a surface whose height indicates the fuel requirement based on both throttle angle position and engine speed will give a unique fuelling value under all conditions. The work described employs this technique and explains how a digital computing method is used to transpose the value of throttle angle and speed into a fuel quantity injected in the engine intake tract every cycle. The engine work required to obtain the surface is described and it is also explained how a sophisticated ignition timing surface can be devised. 730126-730132 Factors determining the type of electric to hydraulic interface required are discussed. Although unaided fuel injection cannot meet the federal 1975 and 1976 exhaust pollution requirements, it can make a worthwhile con- tribution to the problem by enabling the engineer to supply his afterburning device with a gas stream of closely controlled quality. 730129. Electromagnetic Interference and the Automo- bile. Garth L. Maxam, Oliver T. McCarter and Donald E. Schofield, Research Labs., General Motors Corp., Engineering Staff, General Mo- tors Corp. The modern automobile includes vital systems that can be disturbed by interference by its neighbors. At the same time, it has begun to create interference in the electro- magnetic environment. The purpose of this paper is to define the overall problem from an automotive viewpoint, and define tasks for the future. It includes the causes of the problem, current methods of assessment, and the physical hazards of interference. Particular emphasis is placed on the internal automotive environment, since this is the major source of mutual interference among the vehicle's accessories. 1973 SAE Transactions 730130. Transducers for Automotive Control Systems. F. L. Zeisler, Ford Motor Co. A brief review of current transducers on the vehicle is presented, outlining function and characteristics. As it is the lack of suitable devices which limits many systems, a set of potential transducer needs for certain current and potential systems is presented. A specific set of transducer requirements for a precision fuel management system is developed. 730131. Performance of Electronics in the Automobile to Date at Chrysler. I. Balan, C. J. VanHalteren and R. M. Weier, Chrysler Corp. Electronics in today's automobile plays a vital factor in performance, service life, and reliability of the compo- nents in which they are used. High-volume usage is found in automotive charging and ignition systems. This paper deals with the per- formance in the field to date at Chrysler Corporation of semi-conductor devices in these applications. The impor- tance of diagnostic equipment is also covered, and two specific examples designed for the quick diagnosis of trouble in electronic voltage regulators and electronic ignition systems, respectively, are presented. 730132. One-Wire Automotive Electrical Systems. Joseph F. Ziomek, Ford Motor Co. A single-wire vehicle electrical control system is applied to the various vehicle electrical functions. The resultant three-wire system (signal, power, ground) reduces wire bulk in the floor, door, instrument panel, and engine compartment of the vehicle. Increased control switch and 97</page><page sequence="21">730133-730140 component complexity, due to the additional solid-state components, required may affect overall reliability. Improved power bus and signal bus protection must be added to the control system. Failure of the entire single-wire control system, due to accidental grounds or opens, limits application to certain noncritical vehicle electrical systems. 730133. Measured Statistical Characteristics of Automo- tive Ignition Noise. Robert M. Storwick and David C. Schlick, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Noise produced by automotive ignition systems can deteriorate the performance of nearby communication systems. An important step toward alleviating this difficulty is to characterize the ignition noise. Measure- ments have been made of the noise peak amplitude distribution of a number of identically equipped vehicles over a fixed period of time. Both vertical and horizontal polarizations were used, and measurements were made at two frequencies, 145 and 230 MHz. These statistics were then compared to various probability distributions to attempt to characterize the amplitude distribution of the noise. The distributions studied were: the log-normal, the exponential, the Rayleigh, and the Weibull distributions. It was concluded that the best fit was provided by the Weibull distribution. The parameters of the best fitting distribution are primarily a function of the antenna's polarization, with frequency having only a minor effect. 730134. Using Adhesives Effectively. Gerald L. Schne- berger, General Motors Institute. This paper begins with an explanation of adhesion and a practical definition of adhesives. The response of common bond designs to typical stresses is then examined. Emphasis is placed on selecting designs which will utilize the energy absorbing characteristics of adhesives. Finally there is a discussion of the most common practical difficulties encountered in a production bonding opera- tion. 730135. How to Use Anaerobics Successfully. M. B. Pearce, Loctite Corp. Many design problems associated with threaded fasteners, press-fitted assemblies, and sealing of threaded and flanged assemblies can now be solved by using anaerobic liquid compounds. These one-part polyester resins convert from a liquid to form a tough, thermoset plastic material that completely fills the tolerance gap to augment thread locking, doubles the strength of press-fitted parts, and seals the "inner space" from environmental attack. These liquid compounds fill all surface irregularities, tolerance gaps, and effectively seal clearances up to 0.020 in. They can be applied by high-speed applicators on moving production lines while assuring controlled predictable strengths in metal-to-metal assembly applications at substantial cost savings over conventional methods. The cured polyester film provides excellent chemical resistance and resists most liquids and gases within an operating temperature range of -65-300 F (-55-150 C). 730136. Bonding Processes in Automotive Manufacture. G. O. DeFrayne and S. B. Twiss, Chrysler Corp. Five bonding processes used in the automotive industry, ranging from structural adhesive to nonstructural and filler, are discussed in this paper. Surface preparation, including use of primers; nature, application, and curing of adhesive; secondary processes; in-line testing and destructive test methods; and repair processes are cov- ered. The integral bonding of disc pad shoe assemblies is detailed. Vinyl plastisol adhesives are used for bonding assemblies. Windshield and backlight bonding is a semistructural adhesive application. Contact bonding cements bond exterior vinyl roof covering to roof panels. A vinyl plastisol sealer replaces solder on the joint between the roof and rear quarter panel. 730137. Environmental Degradation in Adhesive Bonded Glass-Resin Composite Joints. Andrew T. De- vine and Raymond F. Wegman, Picatinny Arsenal. New data on the durability of bonded glass-resin com- posites are presented which indicate that joint failure is frequently not a failure of the adhesive component of the joint but rather environmental degradation of the adher- end. It is essential to know how each component of a bonded joint is effected by its service environment before durable bonded joints can be designed. 730139. Determination of Accumulated Structural Loads from S/N Gage Resistance Measurements. Nar- endra J. Sheth, Stephen L. Bussa and Nelson M. Mercer, Ford Motor Co. A new, low cost method to determine the accumulated structural loads in service (not to predict component fatigue life) that requires practically no on-board in- strumentation is discussed. This method makes use of S/N fatigue life gages with high gain mechanical multipliers bonded to a component. Permanent change in gage resistance results from the number of component load cycles and their magnitudes. These resistance change data are then used to reconstruct the load range history. The computer program on this method is listed in the Appendix. Results of laboratory tests conducted to validate the new method and evaluate the behavior of the multipliers over a practical range of operating temperature and strain magnitude and frequency are presented. The component load range distribution estimated by this method is compared to that measured by conventional methods for a vehicle operating on a proving ground route. The paper concludes with an application philos- ophy of this new method and a discussion of future plans. 1973 SA E Transactions 730140. Field Test Data versus Customer Loads. Dale R.

Field Testing of Timberjack Log Skidder. Serge Caillet, Eaton Corp. Description of a log-skidder test program. Extreme weather conditions and special data requirements led to the use of telemetry. Techniques to solve instrumentation problems in the field are presented, and evaluated in function of the results obtained. Emphasis is given to the planning of the test and the playback of the data. 730142. The Effect of Impact Fatigue Prestressing on the High Cycle Fatigue Resistance of Carburized Gear Steels. J. J. deBarbadillo, The Interna- tional Nickel Co., Inc. Gears are frequently exposed to conditions involving random or repeated high strain rate loading in addition to high cycle bending fatigue stresses. Although gears usually fail ultimately by high cycle fatigue, random impact loads superimposed on the predictable bending fatigue stress may lead to premature fatigue failure. The present study examined the effect of repeated prior impact loading on the high cycle fatigue properties of carburized 4118, 4820 and EX-1 steels. It was found that impact prestressing does affect the endurance limit and that this effect can either be detrimental or beneficial. Case microstructure, particularly retained austenite content, and nickel content both affected sensitivity to impact prestressing. The greatest resistance to impact fatigue damage was found in EX-1 steel which had been heat treated to contain approximately 20% austenite. The results of this study have been interpreted in terms of the Troiano theory of ductility in high carbon alloy steel. 730143. Method of Hardening Case-Carburized Steels. R. A. Grange, U.S. Steel Corp. A 4-step heat treatment for hardening case-carburized steels has been developed and is here described and compared with conventional hardening. In step 1 of this new method, steel is case carburized and oil quenched; much higher than normal carburizing temperatures can be used. Step 2 eliminates retained austenite by heating in the bainite region, for example, 700 F for 2 h. Step 3 is a rapid austenitizing treatment followed by an oil quench, and step 4 a temper at -400 F. 730141-730148 Three representative grades of low-alloy steels were investigated to determine their response to this new hardening treatment and to explore the variables which influence the product. It is shown that the treatment permits faster carburizing without affecting the quality of the case by carburizing at least as high as 1900 F. The new 4-step hardening method is" shown to have the following principal advantages over conventional methods: 1. It develops higher hardness in the outer case. 2. It refines the grain size of both case and core. 3. It makes it feasible to use higher carburizing temperatures and hence shorten the carburizing cycle. 4. It develops a case microstructure relatively less affected by chemical composition of the steel or by carburizing variables. It offers promise of improving the performance of case-carburized parts (gears, bearing races, etc.). 1973 SA E Transactions 730145. Rating Traction and Wear - A Review. D. Schuring, Calspan Corp. The paper reviews existing methods of measuring tread wear and traction and discusses their applicability to tire grading if performed on an indoor facility with a simulated roadway. Indoor testing would assure accurate control of all performance parameters, rapid collection of data, and effective exploration of new test cycles and rating systems. 1973 SA E Transactions 730147.

A general set of specifications is given for the entire test system. The major subsystems described are the trailer with its versatile suspension; the tow vehicle and its performance capabilities; the transducer system which measures the normal load, lateral force, fore-and-aft force, aligning torque, steer angle and speed; and the instru- mentation. The calibration method is described. The test methods described include those for straight- line braking, maximum lateral traction, steady-state and transient steering response, and combined braking and cornering traction.

Toward Higher Speeds and Outputs From the Small Diesel Engine. D. Broome, Ricardo &amp; Co. Engineers (1927) Ltd. (England). Wide experience with small, high-speed diesel engines in European commercial service, with which the author's company has been particularly connected, led to sponsor- ship by the U.S. Army Tank- Automotive Command of design and test work to study combustion and breathing problems in diesel engines at very high speeds, found only in gasoline racing engines, and under boosted conditions. The paper describes the preliminary studies of the special problems of the project, and of the design of the single-cylinder test engine evolved to allow detailed investigations of these problems to be undertaken. Test results are presented to show that the required rating can be achieved, and that a viable mechanical design to meet the severe operating conditions is possible. Included are preliminary studies of the package size and performance of a possible 4-cyl version of the engine for military use. 730150. The Catepillar IMEP Meter and Engine Friction. William L. Brown, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A report on a detailed evaluation of cylinder pressure measurement was made in 1967 by the author. At the beginning of that paper, the primary importance of cylinder pressure measurement was pointed out. Pressure is the means by which work is extracted from the gases; the cycle is known only to the extent that this work function f PdV is known. At the end of that paper, it was concluded that cylinder pressure could be measured accurately enough to determine imep and that complete electronic determination of imep was needed. A system for determining imep electronically with excellent accu- racy has been developed and has been in use for several years. This paper describes the Caterpillar indicated mean effective pressure (imep) meter and gives a sample of the information it can provide. 1973 SA E Transactions 730151. Bearing Damage Detection Method for Produc- tion Diesel Engines. F. P. Origer, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. This paper describes the development and application of a method for detecting bearing damage occurring in diesel engines during production engine test. The method involves the analysis of a special lube oil filter disc for content of the trace element silver which has been added to the engine main and connecting rod bearings. Use of the procedure eliminates the cost of disassembly of production engines to check for bearing damage before shipment. 730152. The Effect of Charge Dilution on CBC Variations and Exhaust Emissions of an SI Engine. W. J. Anderson, Chrysler Corp.; S. S. Lestz and W. E. Meyer, The Pennsylvania State University. Current methods for reducing emission of oxides of nitrogen (NOJ from the spark ignition (SI) engine employ dilution of intake charge with relatively inert gases which tends to limit peak combustion temperatures and pres- sures. Employment of intake charge dilution has led to reduction in engine power output and increased combus- tion cycle-by-cycle (CBC) irregularity. This investigation sought to determine the degree of increased CBC combustion variations experienced as increased amounts of charge dilution reduce emission of NOx. Emission of unburned hydrocarbons (HCs) was also documented. It was found that increased CBC variations result from employing intake charge dilution as a tool to reduce NOx emissions. The significant aspects of the increased CBC variations were an observed increase in maximum cyclic pressure dispersion, a slower flame speed as reflected by an increased angle of occurrence of peak cyclic pressure, and increased variations in the crank angle of peak pressure. 730153. Effects of Spark Location and Combustion Du- ration on Nitric Oxide and Hydrocarbon Emis- sions. Ather A. Quader, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. This study describes the effect of spark plug location on NO and HC emissions from a single-cylinder engine with a specially modified combustion chamber. The effects of changes in combustion duration caused either by spark location, dual spark plugs, or charge dilution on NO and HC emissions were also examined. Experiments were run at constant speed, constant load, and mbt spark timing. Nitric oxide emissions were the same with the spark plug located either near the intake or exhaust valve, but were higher with the spark plug midway between the valves or with dual ignition. Hydrocarbon emissions were lowest with the spark plug nearest the exhaust valve and increased with the distance of the spark plug from the exhaust valve. With charge dilution the decrease in NO emission was isolated into a pure dilution effect and a combustion duration effect. The combustion duration effect was minimal at rich mixtures and increased with air-fuel ratio. The implications of these results are presented and discussed. Discussion: James G.

The Effect of Combustion Chamber Shape on Nitrogen Oxides. Yasuo Sakai, Hiroaki Miya- zaki and Kosaburo Mukai, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Many previous studies have revealed that both peak combustion temperature and its progress in the engine cycle are major factors in nitric oxide (NO) formation. In this paper, the relationship between combustion pattern and NO emission has been investigated experimentally, changing combustion chamber shape and spark plug location in a single cylinder, 4-cycle gasoline engine. Besides the effect on NO, the tolerance for lean mixture operation and exhaust gas recirculation was also examined experimentally. 730155. Test Planning and Execution for General Motors Experimental Safety Vehicle Program. W. F. Kruckeberg, D. S. Shaw, R. C. Moore and D. L. Crockett, General Motors Corp. During the General Motors Experimental Safety Vehicle (ESV) program, a test plan was prepared for submission to the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) in compliance with Contract DOT-OS-00095, providing for ESV prototype evaluation in areas of crash injury reduction and accident avoidance. A comprehensive in-house test program, similar to the Government test plan, was prepared and utilized during the prototype development phases of the GM ESV project to validate contract performance specifications. 730156. A Rear-End Barrier Impact Simulation Model for Unibody Passenger Cars. Kuang-Huei Lin, Re- search Labs., General Motors Corp. The simulation model presented in this report is capable of analytically predicting the dynamic responses of the unibody passenger car during a rear-end barrier impact. A five-degree-of-freedom system consisting of a rigid barrier mass, four vehicle masses, and seven nonlinear resistances represents the vehicle impacting the barrier, or vice versa. Five equations of motion are derived and ten initial conditions are specified for the model to define an initial-value problem. Due to the complexities of force- deformation characteristics of the resistances, the solution is derived by a numerical method. A computer program in PL/I for the IBM 360/65 is developed to perform the solution. Output data are available in both numeric and graphic forms. The simulation results are in good agreement with the results of the actual barrier test. Examples of application are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the simulation model in investigating various problems of practical interest. 1973 SAE Transactions 730157. Vehicle Crush Prediction Using Finite-Element Techniques. J. E. Thompson, Chrysler Corp. The principal objective of this investigation has been to develop analytical tools in the form of computer programs which will permit the automobile designer to predict the 730154-730159 crush characteristics of a given car structure due to forces generated in a variety of impact modes. The predictive or control capability is embodied in two large computer programs. "TELSAP" forms, reduces, and inverts the vehicle structure mass matrix expressed relative to. a datum coordinate system and writes the mass matrix and its inversion onto a file for reading by the "CRUSH" program. "CRUSH" is a general matrix structural analysis program which calculates the large, plastic, rate-sensitive response of an interconnected beam structure due to known dynamic boundary displacement inputs. The theoretical bases and assumptions employed in developing these programs are described along with detailed discussion of how the automobile design engineer might use them to develop a new vehicle structure. Experimental correlation with the computer models is given for a vehicle-to-vehicle 90 deg intersection collision between a special rigid moving barrier and an inter- mediate size four-door sedan. The structural model was further correlated with a laboratory test of a clamped- clamped beam struck at its center by an impact pendulum. The correlation indicates general agreement between experimental and analytical results. By using the computer programs developed in this investigation, the automobile designer is able to reduce the amount of testing required to prove out his design, and is able to identify the benefits of a particular structural reinforcement with a minimum of development time and expense. 1973 SAE Transactions 730159. Exhaust Emission Characteristics of a Small 2-Stroke Cycle Spark Ignition Engine. R. E. Kollman, S. S. Lestz and W. E. Meyer, The Pennsylvania State University. The 2-stroke cycle engine has not been subject to extensive exhaust emission research because small vehicles which commonly employ 2-stroke cycle engines are not covered by federal emission regulations. This paper reports the results of a 2-stroke engine study conducted to determine the level of the unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emission and its source. Other gas phase exhaust emis- sions are reported as well. Exhaust composition curves were generated from a material balance model with HCs included as a product. The calculated curves were used in the analysis of the experimental data. It was determined that 25-40% of the fuel air mixture was short-circuited to the exhaust in the scavenging process which resulted in unburned HC concentrations of 5000-1000 ppm hexane equivalent. It was found that short-circuiting is a function of load but is relatively independent of speed. Emission of carbon monoxide is highly dependent on carburetor tuning and can be reduced to less than 1% vol by tuning alone. Nitric oxide emission is low compared to uncontrolled 4-stroke engines; mass emission is less than 5 g/bhp«h at most operating conditions. 1973 SAE Transactions 101</page><page sequence="25">730160-730168 730160. Noise Produced by Unsteady Exhaust Efflux from an Internal Combustion Engine. G. P. Blair and S. W. Coates, The Queen's University of Belfast (Northern Ireland). From a theoretical analysis of the unsteady efflux from the open end of a simulated reciprocating internal combustion engine exhaust system a prediction of overall and one-third octave sound pressure levels in space, due to this gas flow, is produced. The predictions are compared with measured levels and show a high degree of corre- lation. Discussion: John A.

André Garnault, Société de l'Aérotrain. A tentative summary has been made of the possible impact of the use of air cushion in the field of passenger ground transportation aboard a guided vehicle, derived from more than 15 years of research and development including over 1000 h of full-scale tests. Basic technical features of air cushion and especially of plenum chambers are recalled with their consequences on guideway and vehicle design, guideway-vehicle interaction and passen- ger comfort. After giving proper consideration to the speed range in which convenient modes of propulsion can be associated with air cushion suspension to develop a technically feasible system, economical data are proposed. They show clearly the wide areas where air cushion vehicles of the described technology can be used. 730162. The TTI Hovair PRT System. Eino K. Latvala, Transportation Technology, Inc. Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) multimode and scheduled service characteristics of automated people movers are presented. A description of the operating and design features of the single-sided linear induction motor (LIM) and the HOVAIR air-cushion technology is included, along with important characteristics of the vehicle, the guideways, and the switches. The particular advantages of off-line docking stations, such as saving space in stations and improved passenger flow through the use of random access docks, are discussed. The command and control philosophy, some performance data, and rough budgetary price information are also given. 730164. Suspension Design and Tolerance Effects on Vehicle Attitudes. D. W. Doran, Chrysler Corp. Vehicle attitude control has been of interest to automotive engineers since the early days of the automobile. As the automobile became more complex and vehicle ride and handling characteristics became more important, vehicle attitude control became an ever-increasing factor. Now, with the advent of government standards regarding vision, lighting, and the new bumper impact standard, vehicle attitude control becomes a prime factor in vehicle design. A method of accomplishing attitude control is discussed in this paper. 730165. Vehicle Attitude Effects on Exterior Protection, Headlamp Aiming, Driver Vision Capabilities. J. B. Mclntyre and T. L. Logar, American Motors Corp. The accurate prediction of vehicle attitudes under both static and dynamic loading conditions is necessary in order to ascertain the actual performance of the vehicle in regard to federal standards. This paper discusses the causes and effects of these variations with regard to headlamps, driver vision, and bumpers. The problems of meeting present and proposed FMVSS are touched upon. 730166. Vehicle Attitude Control Methods. Robert Hegel, Monroe Auto Equipment Co. As a necessary condition of use, vehicles have suspension systems that must provide reasonable ride comfort and handling and be versatile enough to permit large changes in vehicle loading. Current constraints on vehicle attitude variation allow a reasonable compromise between ride and this vibration, using an open loop relationship between loading and attitude. Future constraints on attitudes will cause a change, either in the compromise, or require a more sophisticated relationship. This paper describes the fundamentals of suspension related to vehicle attitude and the details of several closed loop attitude control systems. 730167. A New Diesel Combustion Chamber - The Var- iable-Throat Chamber. B. Brisson, Société d'E- tude des Machines Thermiques; A. Ecomard and P. Eyzat, Institut Francais du Pétrole. This paper describes a variable-throat combustion cham- ber developed by I.F.P. and the Société d'Etude des Machines Thermiques. The chamber seems to offer advantages in overall efficiency with a reduced maximum pressure. It also shows a tendency to emit fewer pollutants than conventional combustion chambers. Design details are discussed, along with combustion speed, heat transfer coefficient, reliability testing, and emissions. The chamber is intended primarily for railroad locomotives. 1973 SA E Transactions 730168. Fuel Quality of Engine Design: Which Controls Diesel Emissions? E. Shamah and T. O. Wagner, Amoco Oil Co. Federal standards on diesel exhaust smoke are currently in force and standards on carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbon emissions for the 1974 model year were issued recently by EPA. Except for smoke, relatively little information is availble on the relation of fuel quality to emissions from diesel engine, but control of diesel emissions via fuel has been suggested by users, control agencies and public interest groups. To provide information on effects of fuel quality, emissions were 102</page><page sequence="26">measured from three diverse engines with fuels that exceeded the commercial range in quality of No. 1 and 2 diesel fuels. It was found that fuel properties have measurable effects on emissions, but the effects are much smaller than those of engine design and operating conditions. It is concluded that changing fuel quality does not represent an effective way to control emissions from today's diesel engines. 730169. Factors Affecting Smoke and Gaseous Emissions from Direct Injection Engines and a Method of Calculation. I. M. Khan, G. Greeves and C. H. T. Wang, CAV Ltd. This paper consists of two parts. Part I concerns the effects of injection timing, injection rate, and air swirl on emission of smoke and gaseous pollutants from direct- injection diesel engines. Studies show that fuel-injection equipment and variables such as nozzle configuration affect pollutant production and emission because they affect fuel-air mixing. An increased rate of injection or air swirl increases the rate of fuel-air mixing and reduces the amount of exhaust smoke and its dependence on injection timing. An increase in rate or swirl ratio increases nitric oxide emission at a given injection timing, but the increase is relatively small compared with reduction obtained by retarding injection timing. Substantial retard, in con- junction with increased rate of fuel-air mixing, limits loss in engine efficiency. Part II reports development of a model for calculating soot and nitric oxide formation. The model predicts effects of injection timing, injection rate, fueling, air swirl ratio, and engine speed on exhaust concentrations of these pollutants. The efficacy of the model and its contribution toward understanding and control of pollutants is dis- cussed. 1973 SAE Transactions 730170. Surveying Tests of Diesel Smoke Suppression with Fuel Additives. Takeshi Saito, Waseda University (Japan); and Masatoshi Nabetani, Japan Automobile Research Institute. The diesel smoke-depressant effects of 26 fuel additives marketed in Japan were tested with the cooperation of the Fuel and Lubricants Committee of the Japan Automobile Research Institute (J ARI) and the Tokyo Metropolitan Office. These bench tests were carried out with a compound on several types of engines under the conditions of overload with heavy smoke; the four effective barium- containing additives were tested under further conditions which included improper engine maintenance, transient operation, and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The exhaust gas compositions and emitted barium solids were analyzed. Also over-the-road tests were performed with 12 city buses for two years. 730171. SMC - Sink Mechanisms and Techniques of Minimizing Sink. Ralph B. Jutte, Owens-Corn- ing Fiberglas Corp. 730169-730175 Two major causes of sink marks above ribs and bosses in compression molded SMC (sheet molding compound) parts are discussed - polymerization shrinkage and ther- mal shrinkage. Polymerization shrinkage has been mini- mized through the use of low profile resin systems. Differential thermal shrinkage is the result of fiber orientation and resin-glass variation that may occur as SMC material flows into the ribs and bosses. A design investigation has shown that ribs with minimum lead-in radii have significantly less sink than ribs with more generous 1/8 in lead-in radii. The effects of various rib geometries on sink have been documented. A materials study has shown that the use of short fibers and increased glass loading generally reduces the level of sink. More importantly, the use of "composite" molding techniques has permitted no sink molding on a lab basis. The term composite here refers to the simul- taneous molding of two different SMC materials. The best results have been obtained with the use of continuous strand mat reinforcement SMC near the flat surface in combination with 1/2 in fiber reinforced SMC in the rib area. 730172. Current Capabilities of Reinforced Plastic Pultru- sion. John D. Tickle, Morrison Molded Fiber Glass Co. This paper discusses the pultrusion process which al- though it is a very new industry has expanded to meet present-day demands. Properties of fiberglass reinforced plastic pultruded shapes are discussed along with their advantages, disadvantages, and current uses. It is pointed out that the determination of factors of safety is dependent upon many variables which the designer must carefully analyze. The considerations involved in this determination are given. 730173. Particulate Mineral Reinforced Polyamide - A New Value Analysis Approach for Automotive Components. Stanley R. Melvin, Monsanto Co. The favorable economics of injection molded thermo- plastic parts have accelerated their growth in automotive components where satisfactory performance of such parts has been demonstrated. This paper describes a new particulate mineral reinforced polyamide (nylon) material development (PMRN) in terms of properties, price/per- formance aspects, comparison to early engineering ther- moplastics, and suggested automotive applications. PMRN offers the automotive design engineer a new thermoplastic material performance option incorporating high rigidity, high heat resistance, high creep resistance, and excellent chemical resistance, together with very rapid molding cycles while more free of sinks and at a cost per cubic inch generally below these other materials. Design and processing details are also discussed. 730175. Contribution of Compression Molded Plastics and Composites to the Automotive Industries. Donald Oddy, GKN Engineering Ltd.

Rearick, General Motors Corp. This paper discusses the development and execution of a unique one-day, hands-on seminar designed to introduce top-level manufacturing managers to the computer. Total emphasis is on manufacturing applications, and each manager is afforded an opportunity to use the computer himself. The mystery of data cards, teletype terminals, and CRTs is removed during line balancing, simulation, and process control work sessions.

A Digital Computer Method for the Prediction of Braking Performance of Trucks and Tractor- Trailers. James E. Bernard, Highway Safety Research Inst., University of Michigan. The simulation of the longitudinal performance of trucks and articulated vehicles requires careful attention to tandem axle dynamics, the brake system model, and the tire model. The approach which was taken to these problems in a recently developed digital simulation is given. Results for the braking performance of an artic- ulated vehicle and a straight truck are compared to empirical data. In addition, simulation results are given for the articulated vehicle equipped with a simple antiskid system. 1973 SA E Transactions 730182. The Measurement of Inertial Properties and Suspension Parameters of Heavy Highway Ve- hicles. Christopher B. Winkler, Highway Safety Research Inst., University of Michigan. The large size of commercial highway vehicles can lead to significant problems in determining their inertial and suspension properties.

Mechanical Properties of Truck Tires. J. T. Tielking, P. S. Fancher and R. E. Wild, Highway Safety Research Inst., The University of Mich- igan. Mechanical properties have been obtained from a recent series of truck tire tests using the Highway Safety Research Institute's (HSRI) flat bed tire testing machine. In addition to the vertical and lateral spring rates, a set of three parameters characterizing traction properties of the rolling tire are defined and measured. The influence of tire load and inflation pressure on mechanical properties is found to be significant. Carpet plots of lateral force versus tire operating variables such as camber and slip angle are used to illustrate the effect of changes in ply rating, tread pattern, and wear. Corresponding variations in the mechanical properties are noted. The results of an experiment to determine the relationship between single tire and dual tire force and moment producing capabilities are also described. 730184. Effects of Tire Slip on the Handling Performance of Tractor-Semitrailers in Braking Maneuvers. George R. Olsson, The University of Michigan. Automatic braking control systems for trucks and trac- tor-semitrailers have become the subject of a sizeable research and development effort. These devices can provide improved vehicle stability and control charac- teristics in braking maneuvers. An analysis utilizing a mathematical model of a tractor-semitrailer vehicle yielded the following results: favorable stability and control characteristics in braking maneuvers are maintain- ed when front wheels do not lock, tractor rear-wheel slip remains less than front-wheel longitudinal slip, and semitrailer rear wheels do not lock. Effects of kingpin (fifth wheel) location and introduction of coulomb friction at the kingpin are also discussed. 730185. The Braun Linear Engine. A. T. Braun, Tecton- ics Research Inc.; and Paul H. Schweitzer, Optimizer Control Corp. This paper presents a novel type of combustion engine that was invented only seven years ago and has been perfected over the last few years. The Braun linear engine is eminently suited to drive reciprocating compressors, pumps, and other machinery which accept linear power input. The unconventional starting is an important asset. An engine compressor of this design weighs less than one third of the conventional machine and has only two major parts. It is more durable, reliable, uses less fuel and is completely balanced. 730186. Squish Velocity in the Combustion Chamber of A Two-Stroke Cycle Engine. Avraham Ziv, McCul- loch Corp. This paper discusses the effect of squish velocity on 2-cycle engine performance. Four combustion chambers, with different squish velocities, were studied. Squish velocity was changed by varying the combustion chamber to the piston area ratio, leaving all other parameters constant. The study concluded that squish velocity has a major effect on optimum ignition timing and rate of combustion pressure rise, with a lesser effect on power, ignition voltage, and spark duration. 104</page><page sequence="28">730187. Throttling oř 2-Stroke Cycle Diesel Engines at Part-Load and Idling. Eiichi Watanabe and Itaru Fukutani, Institute of Vocational Training; Kazunari Komotori and Kunihiro Miyake, Keio University. In order to improve the part-load and idling character- istics of 2-stroke cycle diesel engines, the effect of throttling on engine performance was investigated on a separately scavenged engine with a Roots blower and on a crankcase-scavenged engine. For the first engine, it was found that decreasing the delivery ratio through bypassing a part of scavenging air into the inlet side, that is, by recirculation of scavenging air, made it possible not only to decrease the fuel consumption but also to raise the scavenging temperature which improved combustion. Also, a vehicle test using a bus powered by the same type of engine showed improved mileage through throt- tling. For the crankcase-scavenged engine, it was found that a slight increase in delivery ratio was very effective for improving the performance at low speed with heavy load, and throttling was also effective in improving not only the part-load but also the idling operation. 730188. L-Ring Effect on Air-Cooled Two-Stroke Gaso- line Engines. Shoichi Furuhama and Hiroshi Ichikawa, Musashi Institute of Technology (Japan). An L-ring (a piston ring with an L-shaped cross section) has been used on some air-cooled two-stroke gasoline engines. Good performance has been obtained; the reason is unknown. The maximum power of these small engines (used mainly for small cars, motorcycles, outboard motors, snowmobiles, etc.) is limited by its thermal load endurance. So piston and cylinder become the most important factors to the engine's performance. L-ring effects are examined in the light of these temperature measurements. 730190. Determining the Effects of Brake Degradation. G. L. Parker, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., Dept. of Transportation; T. W. Keran- en and M. H. Cardon, Research Labs., The Bendix Corp. This paper presents an approach for evaluating the effects of brake system component degradation on vehicle braking performance. The approach involves the use of an inertial brake dynamometer, vehicle computer simulation and vehicle test. The approach, procedures, and the results of the study of the effects of worn friction materials, worn discs and drums, and contaminated brakes are presented. 1973 SA E Transactions 730191. Simulation and Characterization of Used Brake Friction Materials and Rotors. M. G. Jacko and R. T. DuCharme, Research Labs., Bendix Corp. A method has been developed to simulate worn-in-service 730187-730195 brake friction materials and rotors. The simulated thin linings and worn rotors were prepared by grinding the materials to a predetermined level and then subjecting the prethinned friction couple to a moderate inertial-dyna- mometer conditioning sequence. The friction materials were characterized by optical microscopy and thermo- gravimetric analysis. The rotors were characterized by surface roughness measurements and scanning electron microscopy. The simulated components were shown to have the same microstructure and chemical compositions as worn- in-service components. The extent of thermal and me- chanical damage was found to be proportional to the duty cycles experienced. By the method described, the friction- affected layers of the simulated friction couple were found to be intermediate between those of a similar couple with 40,000 miles of light use and those of a couple with 3300 miles of medium-duty durability use. These simulated components were then used in a study of the effects of worn brake components on braking system performance. 1973 SA E Transactions 730192. Inertia Dynamometer Evaluation of Brake Lining Materials. John D. Preston, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Brake lining performance as depicted by small friction machines does not reflect the performance obtained during vehicle brake tests. This paper shows that an inertia dynamometer using full-scale vehicle brake hard- ware can be programmed to simulate vehicle test condi- tions and produce brake performance data corresponding to vehicle test data. Methods for determining the dyna- mometer flywheel inertia and brake cooling airflow are discussed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730193. Stopping-Distance Analysis. Richard L. Lewis and Robert E. Raymond, The Bendix Corp. This paper discusses a method of plotting and comparing the theoretical, required, and measured stopping distance as required by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The high coefficient stopping-distance require- ments have been extrapolated to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) skid numbers over a range of 50 to 120. This will give the brake system designer more confidence in test results on a known skid number surface. A graphical technique has been developed which enables the brake system designer to systematically compare predicted and actual performance of various brake system designs on a variety of tire-road coefficients with DOT requirements for the same conditions. Sample graphs are shown along with the instructions for carrying out the procedure. 1973 SA E Transactions 730195. The Influence of the Exhaust Back Pressure of a Piston Engine on Air Consumption, Performance, and Emissions. Jay A. Bolt, Stephen P. Bergin 105</page><page sequence="29">730196-730200 and Frederick J. Vesper, The University of Michigan. The theoretical relationship between engine air con- sumption and exhaust back pressure is derived for an idealized, 4-stroke-cycle engine inlet process, and com- pared to results obtained by testing a typical automobile engine. The exhaust back pressure of a 1971 Ford 351-W, V8 engine was varied 0.5-1.5 atm, under a wide range of engine speeds and loads. The results show that engine air consumption responds to variation of the ratio of absolute exhaust back pressure to absolute inlet manifold pressure in a manner approximating that indicated by theory, with a strong dependence on engine speed. These data can be useful in the design of speed-density fuel injection systems for automobiles. Data are also presented concerning the effect of exhaust back pressure on performance and exhaust emissions. Increase in exhaust back pressure decreases nitric oxide, due to the increased exhaust gas remaining in the cylinder, as has also been demonstrated by others. Hydrocarbon emissions are also reduced as exhaust back pressure is increased, since the last exhaust gas to leave the cylinder has a higher hydrocarbon concentration. 730196. Reactive Exhaust Emissions from Current and Future Emission Control Systems. Eric E. Wigg, Esso Research and Engineering Co. Data obtained from six vehicles equipped with current and advanced emission control systems are used to define fuel-exhaust compositional relationships for hydrocarbons and aldehydes, with special emphasis on photochemically reactive exhaust species. The vehicle emission control system is shown to strongly influence hydrocarbon mass emission level and hydrocarbon composition. However, the distribution of individual species within the two reactive hydrocarbon classes, olefins and aromatics, is shown to be only slightly affected by vehicle system. The exhaust olefin data from the current systems are used to define the relationship between exhaust olefin composi- tion and branched character of the fuel paraffin fraction. Branched fuel paraffins are shown to favor propylene and C4 olefin production, while straight chain paraffins are shown to favor ethylene production. Regression expres- sions are presented which relate individual and subclass exhaust olefin concentrations to the concentrations of various hydrocarbon classes in the fuel. The concentration of C7 and higher exhaust aromatic components are shown to be adequately described in terms of the concentrations of the corresponding components in the fuel. Correlations between exhaust benzaldehyde content and fuel toluene content, as well as between exhaust tolualdehyde and fuel xylene content, are given which appear to adequately describe the relationships between these oxygenated species and fuel composition. Data are given for a platinum oxidation catalyst-equipped vehicle, operated under nonoptimal conditions. The results of experiments designed to show the effects of restricted secondary air, high temperature excursions, and short-term exposure to fully leaded fuel on hydrocarbon and oxygenate mass and composition are discussed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730197. Application of Air Pollutant Damage Functions to Auto Smog Control. Marian F. Chew, Con- sultant. This paper describes an air pollution control strategy that utilizes air pollutant damage functions. Air pollutant damage functions relate economic losses to man and his environment to varying levels of air pollution. The use of damage functions allows the strategist to develop an air pollution control program which considers benefits and costs of control as decision criteria. In this work, damage functions were calculated for six major pollutants. Using damage functions, benefits (reductions in damages) resulting from control of auto- mobile exhaust in 1966-1977 are compared with the costs of control. The utility of a damage function in selecting candidates for an air pollution control program and in determining optimum level of control is illustrated. The application of damage functions to control of auto exhaust is illustrative, not definitive. 730198. A Practical Approach to the Selection and Sizing of Brakes to Meet FMVSS-121. R. C. Bueler and E. J. Falk, Wagner Electric Corp. A rational, practical method has been developed to size and select brakes which will meet the requirements of FMVSS-121 for a wide variety of truck models and sizes, with a minimum number of brakes. This paper presents the technique of utilizing Newtonian mechanics to categorize vehicle sizes and allow selection of common brake packages for each category. Actual sizing and selection was based on dynamometer test data. 730199. Automatic Adjusters for Vehicle Brakes. A. W. Harrison, Girling Ltd. (England). The basic functions common to all types of automatic brake adjusters have been defined and identified in several practical examples. Alternative ways of performing these functions and their relative merits in relation to different types of brake are discussed. So that the discussion may be precise enough to be useful, several terms and parameters used to describe braking systems generally are defined. 730200. Equilibrium Considerations in Catalytic Emission Control. Gerald J. Barnes, Richard L. Klimisch and Barbara B. Krieger, Research Labs., Gen- eral Motors Corp. Many methods of altering the composition of internal combustion engine exhaust gases have been considered for reducing automotive air pollution. By providing a low-energy reaction path, catalysis may be the most effective method of reducing automotive air pollution. Since chemical equilibrium represents the ultimate limit of catalytic treatment of engine exhaust, equilibrium com- 106</page><page sequence="30">positions were determined for nine air-fuel mixtures, with overall air-fuel ratios (A/F) ranging 12:1-17:1 (lb air/lb fuel), for temperatures 300-1500°F. A NASA computa- tion procedure based on free-energy minimization was used to determine the equilibrium concentrations. These calculations indicated that true equilibration of exhaust gases, in the temperature range considered, would nearly eliminate the major exhaust pollutants. No hydro- carbons (HC), except nonreactive HC4, appeared in significant concentrations. Even at the leanest A/F considered, equilibrium NO concentrations were less than 30 ppm. Thus, the two major reactants in the formation of photochemical smog, HC and NOx, are essentially elim- inated when the exhaust gases are equilibrated. Only CO, of the major automotive air pollutants, is present in significant concentrations at equilibrium, and then only at rich A/F. True equilibria CO concentrations are less than 0.25% for all A/F greater than 14.6. The results also suggest that the formation of NH3 by NO-reduction catalysis is caused by kinetic limitations which prevent the catalytic formation of HC. The formation of NH3 provides an alternate free-energy "minimum" for the exhaust gas system because of these kinetic limitations. 730201. Warmup Limitations on Thermal Reactor Oxi- dation. Donald J. Patterson and Robert H. Kadlec, The University of Michigan; and Ever- ett A. Sondreal, U. S. Bureau of Mines. Warmup of the Du Pont model V reactor during unchoked engine operation with air injection has been characterized by a nonreactive period, followed by a transition to an ignited condition. The early period is quenched by heat loss. The transition is gradual for hydrocarbons, but more abrupt for carbon monoxide. Model building for the warmup period is directed to the objective of developing a rapid computer simulation to predict light-off times and temperature histories for various reactor designs and operating conditions. Reactor gas temperature and chemical conversions are calculated as solutions for an ideal backmix reactor. Heat balances maintain a record of all reactor metal temperatures for the given configuration. Heat transfer by radiation, convec- tion, and conduction is allowed. The presence of a hot spot in the reactor has a strong effect on time to light-off. In addition to lowering the time, such an ignition source shows a great sensitivity to combustible concentration. The relative amounts of CO, H2, and HCs are also important, since there is a sequential transition to high conversion. Initial reactor temperature and exhaust temperature are also important variables. Variables of reactor design such as insulation thick- ness, materials of construction, internal configuration, and reactor size, also affect warmup. A brief exploration of these parameters has been made. 730202. Limiting Factors on Steady-State Thermal Re- actor Performance. Robert H. Kadlec, The 730201-730204 University of Michigan; Everett A. Sondreal, U. S. Bureau of Mines; Donald J. Patterson and Marshall W. Graves, Jr., The University of Michigan. A comprehensive analytical and experimental study of thermal reactors has been made. The findings have been incorporated into a computer model capable of simulating reactor performance both during warmup and steady-state operation. This paper treats the warmed-up case. Arbi- trary reactor configurations may be explored in regard to the steady-state extent of oxidation of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen (H), with perfect or imperfect mixing and the detrimental effects of heat losses. This experimental and analytical program focused on the Chevrolet 350 in3 engine - Du Pont model V reactor combination. Experimental and calculated results are presented and compared where possible. Analytical models for the Du Pont Reactor were developed each of which treated the exhaust ports, core, and annulus differently. An experimental technique was developed which permits an assessment of the completeness of mixing between exhaust and injected air within a thermal reactor and is expected to be useful as a design aid. In addition to oxidation results for CO, H2, and HC as a whole, measurements were made to determine any changes in NO, aldehydes and olefin, paraffin, and aromatic class proportion affected by the thermal reactor. 730203. Reactor Studies for Exhaust Oxidation Rates. H. A. Lord, E. A. Sondreal, R. H. Kadlec and D. J. Patterson, The University of Michigan. A laboratory test reactor has been used to determine the rates of oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocar- bons (HCs) as a class, and hydrogen (H2). The feed was supplied from the exhaust of a single-cylinder engine, with additions of H2 and CO in some runs. The test reactor was designed to be well mixed and this was verified exper- imentally for mixing on macroscopic and microscopic scales. Wall effects were found to be unimportant. Kinetic data from 157 runs were correlated with global reaction rate expressions containing Arrhenius temper- ature dependence and power law concentration depen- dence. CO oxidation was found to be approximately l/4 order in CO with an activation energy of 28,200 cal/g- mole. HC oxidation was found to be approximately V4 order in HC and l/2 order in each of 02, CO, and NO with an activation energy of 29,800 cal/g-mole. H2 oxidation rates were not well correlated, but a zero-order rate with an activation energy of 52,000 cal/g-mole is reasonable. Simulations of the test reactor were compared to experimental data with excellent agreement. These simu- lations demonstrate that higher orders for these reactions, reported in the literature, may be attributable to mixing limitations in those experiments. 730204. Methods to Achieve Nationwide Automotive Diagnostic Testing. Kenneth I. Fetterhoff and 107</page><page sequence="31">730205-730210 Richard J. Rackliffe, Hamilton Standard Div., United Aircraft Corp. The methods to achieve standardization of automotive diagnostic testing are the subject of this paper. Current diagnostic technology is described by definition and example. The requirements for nationwide implementa- tion of diagnostic testing is analyzed and a preliminary system concept for a standardized diagnostic center is presented. The benefits of such a system are discussed and some future recommendations given. The paper excludes any specific detailed economic tradeoffs which must be done regarding the distribution of centers for optimum consumer travel expense. 730205. Automatic Vehicle Diagnostic Systems. J. R. Kremidas, Research Labs., The Bendix Corp.; and R. W. Rothfusz, Bendix-Westinghouse Air Brake Div., The Bendix Corp. With the increasing emphasis on vehicle safety and proper engine performance to assure low levels of exhaust emissions, automatic diagnostic systems will be required to service the large vehicle population in use. Techniques are described which use a combination of on-vehicle and off-vehicle sensors and equipment to check the condition of engine, drivetrain, brake, steering, and suspension components. The tradeoff considerations for selecting on-vehicle versus off-vehicle sensors are discussed, and types of testing which can be practically implemented are outlined. In addition, the use of results from vehicle handling and brake-system component degradation studies for establishing limits of acceptable performance for auto- matic diagnostic testing are presented. 730206. Systematic Application of Diagnostic and Test Routines in Automobile Servicing. Hans-Dieter Deiss, Volks wagenwerk AG. This paper describes the complexity of service systems for the maintenance and repair of automobiles and outlines the functions and responsibilities of government, auto- mobile manufacturers, the service industry, and vehicle owners. It also provides an analysis of the need to develop standardized plug-in diagnostic testing equipment and presents a proposal for the design of function test equipment for possible joint application by government agencies and the automotive service industry. 730207. Periodic Motor Vehicle Inspection Requirements for Improved Diagnosis. David W. Weiss and James Mateyka, Booz*Allen Applied Research, Inc. Current state periodic motor vehicle inspection (PMVI) programs vary widely both in items inspected and inspection criteria. Many performance parameters not tested could have a significant impact on highway safety. New automotive emissions standards will achieve their goal of reducing air pollution only if periodic inspections are instituted to verify vehicle system performance. Thus, a trend is apparent toward more effective and uniform safety inspection coupled with emissions inspection. Such an inspection is feasible only if inspection automation can provide high throughput, effective testing, and component fault diagnosis. The diagnostic requirement is crucial in protecting the consumer from exposure to a potential ticket to still higher automotive repair bills. 1973 SA E Transactions 730208. Fitting Automotive Diagnostic Systems into Cur- rent Socioeconomics. Marriott J. Ruse, Frost &amp; Sullivan, Inc. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) safety requirements for cars in use and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) automotive exhaust emission requirements are fostering rapid devel- opment of automotive diagnostic inspection technologies. But automotive diagnostics cannot merely be added to daily life - rather, a careful fitting process into the country's socioeconomic vein will be needed to assure constructive and permanent acceptance. Due to the number of cars on the road, a good half of the massive repair and tuning work to result from diagnostic inspections will have to be performed by the independent garages and gasoline service stations. Thus, diagnostic inspection programs must be designed in a manner which will enable most of the above operators to profitably participate, unless chaos is desired. In addition, the entire market in increased safety and tuning repairs will grow much more rapidly after state motor vehicle inspection differences are eliminated. 730209. The Corrodkote Test - 16 Years Later. Gert G. Levy, Chrysler Corp. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the development of the Corrodkote test, and to list some of its contributions to the decorative chromium plating field. Early work with steel and zinc base die-cast test panels is described, followed by chromium plated panels. Performances of both the Corrodkote test and the CASS test are graphed and illustrated. 730210. The Durable CASS Test. David W. Hardesty, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The neutral salt spray as an accelerated corrosion test to predict the service performance of decorative, bright- plated automobile trim gave such unsatisfactory results that the American Electroplaters' Society sponsored development of more rapid and reliable testing methods. The Corrodkote and CASS tests were successfully devel- oped to duplicate the extent and type of corrosion occurring on parts in one winter's service in Detroit. It is suggested that unsatisfactory experience with the neutral salt spray as an accelerated test was due to failure to define service performance properly, and that the CASS test has proved to be more satisfactory mainly because performance criteria have been more realistically defined. 1973 SAE Transactions 108</page><page sequence="32">730211. Predicting Durability of Decorative Chromium Plating in Minutes with the Electrolytic Corro- sion (EC) Test. Roger L. Saur, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Understanding obtained through a research study of corrosion of decorative chromium plating systems is reviewed. From this knowledge, the development of an electrolytic corrosion test (the EC test) is traced. Meas- urements of corrosion sites show that electrolysis for 2 min (6 min elapsed time) in the EC test produces corrosion sites more like those from one year of Detroit service than those produced in 16 h of CASS test exposure. The EC test has been employed for four years with satisfactory results as a monitor of durability of automotive parts plated in a production line. The paper outlines the mechanism by which nickel corrodes, describes the EC test equipment, and gives the results of an evaluation made by GM production per- sonnel. 1973 SA E Transactions 730212. Measurement and Evaluation of Diesel Smoke. Roger C. Bascom, Wen S. Chiù and Ronald J. Padd, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. The development of smoke measurement procedures and instruments has been one of the significant factors contributing to the reduction of smoke from diesel- powered trucks. There is a need, however, for better information on the relation between measurements and the appearance of the smoke plume, for improved smokemeters lowered, and for common international test procedures. Studies of smoke plumes using jet theory, alumina tracer, and hydraulic analog techniques indicate that the plumes are sometimes unstable and subject to large-scale shedding in the region where free-plume smokemeters are located. This introduces a significant random variation into smoke measurements made in this location. A future test procedure based on smoke measurements made with a long path (500 mm) in-line smokemeter during a dynamic cycle is suggested for consideration. Smoke limits would be based on tests similar to those conducted by MIRA to relate smoke levels and engine size to human response. 1973 SA E Transactions 730213. Effect of Inlet Air Humidity and Temperature on Diesel Exhaust Emissions. S. R. Krause, Ethyl Corp., D. F. Merrion, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., GMC; and G. L. Green, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. The Automobile Manufacturers Association (AMA) and the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) contracted with Ethyl Corp. to determine the effects of humidity and temperature on HC, CO, C02, NOx, and smoke emissions on six different manufacturers' engines run over a 13-mode cycle. Emission procedures used are similar to "California Procedures for Diesel Engines in 1973 and 730211-730215 Subsequent Model Year Vehicles Over 6001 Pounds Gross Vehicle Weight" as adopted November 18, 1970 and amended February 17, 1971. Equations are recommended to correct NOx emissions back to standard conditions of 75 grains of H20/lb dry air and 85 F. Humidity had no significant effect on other emissions. Temperature sub- stantially affected the HC, CO, and smoke emissions of some engines. The correlations between four NO/NOx instruments and between two smoke measurement tech- niques are reported. Future work is needed to explain the different levels of NO/NOx shown by the different instruments when measuring diesel exhaust at low con- centrations. 1973 SA E Transactions 730214. Reduction of Emissions from Diesel Engines. C. J. Walder, Ricardo &amp; Co. Engineers (1927) Ltd. The proposed federal and California Regulations affecting emissions from on-highway diesel-powered vehicles have stimulated a critical examination of many forms of combustion chambers in search for a solution to the 5 g/bhp*h combined HC + N02 requirement. Results of tests made on indirect and direct injection systems are presented. It has been shown that with a simple modi- fication to the injection timing of a production engine equipped with a swirl chamber combustion system, combined emissions on the order of 4 g/bhp*h can be achieved under both naturally aspirated and turbocharged conditions. These results are achieved without significant sacrifice of smoke-limited power. Data on heat loss to coolant with the engine tuned for low emissions are presented. The influence of injection and engine variables on the emission characteristics of direct injection systems has been investigated and it is shown that, in general, the measures required to generate low exhaust emissions result in a loss of smoke-limited power and a depreciation in specific fuel consumption. The superiority of the direct injection system over indirect injection chambers in regard to fuel economy is therefore reduced. The effects of exhaust gas recirculation and water injection on emissions are reviewed and it is concluded that neither is very attractive in regard to the reduction of emissions for the complication involved. The possible use of the high-speed diesel engine for use in passenger cars to meet the 1976 Federal Emission Requirements is also discussed. 730215. Integrated Body Design System. Toshiaki Mase, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Up to now, drawing of body lines has taken a long time and required skilled workers, and thus has been an obstacle to shortening the time to develop a new model. A new on-line system and data file, called the Integrated Body Design System, makes body lines lofting easy and speedy, especially in outer panel designs. This on-line system has been developed by: 1. Effective combination of a large computer, a 109</page><page sequence="33">730216-730225 graphic display, a measuring machine, and a numerically controlled drafting machine. 2. Development of software for monitoring a large quantity of data using the technique of list processing. 730216. Computer Aided Design of Hood Hinges. Herbert J. Keller, Jr., Chrysler Corp. A technique for designing five-bar hood hinges using the computer interactively has been developed. Although the computer program itself does not optimize the linkage geometry, the almost instantaneous computer feedback guides the engineer through the design process. Repeated computer runs are made to develop the best possible swing geometry and spring design to meet the require- ments of manufacturability, environment, effort, and hinge structure. 730217. Transbus - Current Developments in Urban Bus Design. John F. Wing, H. H. Buckel and J. A. Mateyka, Booz, Allen Applied Research, Inc. This paper presents major developments in urban bus design which are currently in progress under the sponsor- ship of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration. The paper describes trends in mass transportation since 1945 to illustrate the decline of the transit industry. The needs of the transit industry for a new work-horse vehicle are delineated. The features that are specified for the new 40 ft urban bus (Transbus) are compared with the features of current buses. Three competing prototype bus designs, which are currently under development, are described. Emphasis is placed upon features to improve transit speed, passenger safety, passenger comfort, vehicle aes- thetics, environmental impact, vehicle reliability and maintainability at realistic costs. The program is presented for prototype testing, public demonstration, and pilot production leading to the full-scale introduction of Transbus into the United States urban bus fleet in the latter half of the 1970s. 730218. Reviewing the California Steam Bus Project. Roy A. Renner, International Research and Tech- nology Corp. The California Steam Bus Project demonstrated the potential of low-emission, quiet external combustion engines in public transit service. Three contractors supplied and installed steam powerplants in urban buses, replacing the original diesel engines. Exhaust emissions were found to be considerably lower than the 1975 California requirements for heavy-duty vehicles. Sub- stantial reductions in sound levels were measured in one of the buses. Powerplant weights can be lower than present diesel engines. Road performance was similar to that with diesel engines, but very high fuel consumption was experienced with these nonoptimized demonstration vehicles. Prospects for future improvements are given in this paper, including the outlook for large reductions in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. 1973 SA E Transactions 730219. An Organic Rankine Cycle Engine for a 25- Passenger Bus. M. Reck, Sundstrand Corp.; and D. Randolf, LTV Aerospace Corp. The Department of Transportation has initiated an effort to design, build, and test an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) bus engine. The objective of this effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of this engine in operating a 25-passenger bus. The engine design considerations and resulting configuration are described in this paper. 730220. High Speed Vibration and Customer Acceptance. R. W. Alexander and H. S. Kert, Ford Motor Co. Vibrations encountered in motor vehicles operated at speeds in excess of 60 mph are discussed in terms of source analysis, component response, and vehicle sensi- tivity relative to customer acceptance standards. Two actual case histories are used to illustrate the utility of component order alignment charts, the effec- tiveness of component response control, and the use of sensitivity charts for comparative analysis of subjective data. 730224. Exploratory Evaluation of Ceramics for Auto- mobile Thermal Reactors. Phillip L. Stone and Charles P. Blankenship, Lewis Research Center, NASA. This report summarizes the results obtained in an exploratory evaluation of ceramics for automobile thermal reactors. Potentially usable ceramic materials were eval- uated in several reactor designs employing both engine- dynamometer and vehicle road tests. Silicon carbide contained in a corrugated metal support structure exhibit- ed the best performance, lasting more than 800 h in engine dynamometer tests and for more than 15,000 miles (24,200 km) of vehicle road tests. Although reactors containing glass-ceramics components did not perform as well as silicon-carbide, the glass-ceramics still offer good poten- tial for reactor use. The results of this study are considered to be a demonstration of the potential use of ceramics in thermal reactors. 730225. CER- VIT Material for Emission Control Com- ponents. A. C. Dickson and R. W. Petticrew, Owens-Illinois, Inc. CER- VIT material, a glass-ceramic, has been used as a protective lining for containing the high-temperature gases in automotive thermal reactors. Lined reactors, utilizing the cyclonic mixing concept, have been road tested at operating temperatures of 1900-2000 F and have exhibited no deterioration of the liner. No thermal stress failures haVe occurred in liners subjected to rapid heatup from an ambient temperature of 0 F. Methods of mounting the liners are being developed. The ceramic-to-metal gas seal designs are being explored, 110</page><page sequence="34">and progress in solving these and other problems will be reported. 730226. Special Ceramics for Thermal Reactors. R. A. Alliegro, Norton Co. The severe requirements of thermal reactors preclude the use of conventional ceramic materials. Special ceramics, such as recrystallized silicon carbide and reaction bonded silicon nitride, can be applied due to their superior thermal shock resistance and high temperature properties. Response time of reactors is critical and dictates thin- walled members with low heat capacities. Slip casting provides the means to achieve complex shapes while maintaining high strength; coatings with low emissivities and conductivities provide an additional barrier to heat loss. This combination provides a system which accom- plishes the desired end result. Properties and shape capabilities will be discussed. Flame sprayed coatings are also discussed as thermal barriers oņ conventional metal alloy reactors. These coatings have the potential to extend the life of metals and reduce thermal transfer and subsequent heat loss. 730227. Questor Reverter Emission Control System Total Vehicle Concept. David R. Bentley and Donald J. Schweibold, Questor Corp. A vehicle emissions control system has been conceived and developed with the goal of reducing emissions to significantly less than the 1976 Federal standard of 0.41 g/mile HC, 3.4 g/mile CO, 0.4 g/mile NOx. This system utilizes known emission control methods in a unique sequence. The Reverter system utilizes enriched carburetion and relies on three stages of operation: limited (or partial) oxidation of the exhaust gas without the aid of a catalyst, chemical reduction of nitric oxide aided by a catalyst in the presence of a CO rich atmosphere, and final and complete oxidation of the exhaust gas without the aid of a catalyst. The system has been designed with special provisions for durability, high temperature controls and catastrophic failure protection. The system can operate on commercially available high or low leaded fuels. The Reverter system is discussed from its beginning to its present phase of development. Required operating parameters of the system are described, such as air management and fuel requirements. Investigations of required system materials indicate the possibility of using both high temperature alloys and glass ceramics. Also described are subsystems which will control the operating temperatures under various engine load and speed conditions including catastrophic failure protection for the emission control system. Efforts are outlined to further refine the total system further. It is presented in terms of the development work necessary to lower system operating temperatures, thus reducing the associated fuel economy penalty and in- creasing the system's physical durability. 1973 SA E Transactions 730226-730230 730228. The Influence of Vehicle Add-Ons, Alterations, Maintenance and Use on Vehicle Safety. W. D. Nelson, General Motors Proving Ground. The fad of do-it-yourself automobile customizing began in the late 1930s with cropped roofs. Today, this practice of altering the vehicle from the "as-built" condition con- tinues, offsetting in most cases, the manufacturers' safety design improvements. The purpose of this paper is to call attention to some of these alterations that have compro- mised occupant safety, using examples from actual field accidents. Some of the situations illustrated show that tachom- eters and other miscellaneous devices which are attached to the steering column abort the compressibility of the energy-absorbing device increasing chest injuries. These add-ons are also injury sites for the upper and lower limbs. Another modification is to alter the suspension geometry to achieve a dragster appearance. The raising of the rear end exposes the fuel tank, normally protected by the rear structure from direct contact by another vehicle in a rear-end collision situation. An example of how these changes increase the injury risk to an occupant of the striking car is shown. Other items include upper and lower instrument panel alterations and add-ons, visibility, removal of headrests, and maintenance. The magnitude of the role played by these owner modifications is not known, but case studies confirm that they are factors in the annually reported traffic deaths and injuries. 1973 SA E Transactions 730229. An In-Depth Look at the Safety Status of Vehicles on The United States Highway. Frank- lin G. Fisher, Jr., Ultrasystems, Inc.; and George Parker, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., U.S. Dept. of Transportation. The study reported here was conducted to determine the in-use condition of automobiles on United States high- ways as a function of age, mileage, model year, make, and model. In order to minimize the variances that ensue when data are collected from various sources, criteria were developed for selecting qualified diagnostic centers. Standard component test criteria were also developed for evaluating tested components as either "pass" or "de- fective." A vehicle-condition computer data model was constructed to verify vehicle outages at the subsystem, component group, and component levels. The computer program performed a preliminary statistical analysis of the data parametrically and also generated plots of average percentage outages against specified parameters. The validity and reliability of the data assure that statistical findings are at least significant at the 5% level. The results show that vehicles in states with periodic inspection are in much better condition than those in states with random inspection. 730230. Results of a Study to Determine Accident Causes. John R. Treat and Kent B. Joscelyn, Indiana University. Ill</page><page sequence="35">730231-730234 Results of an accident investigation project conducted by the Indiana University Institute for Research in Public Safety for the National Highway Traffic Safety Admin- istration of the U.S. Dept. of Transportation are pre- sented. The study focused on the statistical determination of the relative roles played by human, environmental and vehicle deficiencies in automobile accident causation. This paper emphasizes the examination of the role of the vehicle. The study was based in Monroe County, Indiana. Data were collected on three levels: baseline data were assembled to allow definition of the project universe; accidents were investigated on-site at the time of occur- rence by technicians; and a sample of these accidents was independently examined by a multidisciplinary team. Causative factors were identified and ranked. Vehicle-related deficiencies were identified as having a probable involvement as either causative or severity- increasing factors, in not less than 14% of accidents investigated. A definite involvement as causative factors was established in not less than 6% of accidents inves- tigated. A comparison of component outage rates of the accident-involved vehicles and vehicles of the nonaccident population is also presented. 730231. A Practical Approach to the Reduction of Vehic- ular Carbon Monoxide Fatalities. William C. Masemore, Maryland Medical-Legal Founda- tion; and Russell S. Fisher, Chief Medical Examiner, State of Maryland. The cause of accidental carbon monoxide (CO) poison- ings often involves an interaction of poor vehicular design, flimsy vehicular construction, poor vehicular mainte- nance, faulty repair work, and careless use of the vehicle. An approach to the reduction of these accidents must therefore concentrate on practical ways to prevent, detect, and eliminate vehicular defects leading to the introduction of exhaust gases into passenger compartments. Examples of such methods include redesign of exhaust systems, implementation of sturdier construction mate- rials, more comprehensive motor vehicle inspection systems, and the education of vehicle owners and vehicle repairmen on the prevention and detection of defects in vehicular exhaust systems and components of vehicle bodies adjacent to the exhaust system. Case studies are presented representing common modes of CO poisoning in vehicular settings, and for each case a cause is determined and discussed in terms of preventive action needed. Suggestions for familiarizing all persons involved in the operation and repair of motor vehicles with practical means by which to determine the integrity of the exhaust system and vehicle body are proposed as a step toward reducing the human errors which result in accidental CO poisonings. 730232. Theoretical Prediction of the Aerodynamic De- rivatives of a Vehicle in Crosswind Gusts. W. H. Hucho and H. J. Emmelmann, Volkswagenwerk AG. The aerodynamic derivatives governing the crosswind sensitivity of a vehicle are the coefficients of side force and yawing moment. Usually, these derivatives are measured in a wind tunnel under stationary conditions, but driving through a wind gust or a vehicle's wake is a transient process. Therefore, when the behavorial char- acteristics of a vehicle in a crosswind are calculated with the aid of a mathematical model, the effects of transient aerodynamics should not be neglected. An estimate of these effects is made on a simple model describing the flow past a moving vehicle. At first, side force and yawing moment in stationary conditions are calculated on the slender body theory, which is converted from aircraft aerodynamics to the aerodynamics of ground-vehicles. A reasonable agreement with full-scale measurements seems to justify the application of the same theory to the calculation of the transient crosswind-gust factor. De- pendent on the gradient of the crosswind, the vehicle suffers from remarkable additional forces and moments due to quasi-stationary and transient effects. 1973 SA E Transactions 730233. The Influence of Roughness Elements on Lamin- ar to Turbulent Boundary Layer Transition as Applied to Scale Model Testing of Automobiles. L. Daniel Metz, University of Illinois; and Kenneth Sensenbrenner, North American Rock- well Corp. When undertaking investigations into the aerodynamic behavior of automobiles using scale models in a wind tunnel, Reynolds Number dynamic equivalence is often difficult or impossible to obtain. The boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent flow thus does not occur at a point on the model which corresponds to the transitional location on the real vehicle. To improve results obtained in such tests, roughness elements can be applied to the scale model to be tested and the transitional position of the boundary layer manipulated to correspond to the position of transition on the actual vehicle of interest. This paper describes such techniques and illus- trates their use. 730234. Aerodynamic Disturbances Encountered in High- way Passing Situations. Glen J. Brown, Devel- opmental Sciences, Inc. Measurements are made of the unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments acting on a 1/10-scale intermediate sedan as it is passed by buses and trucks in the influence of several values of ambient crosswind. These measure- ments are made on the "Highway Aerodynamic Test Facility," a high-speed moving model facility built by Developmental Sciences, Inc., under a DOT-NHTSA contract. In this study, both the metric and disturbing models are traveling at actual highway speeds (70 mph) when the measurements are made. The accuracy of this 112</page><page sequence="36">method, as well as new techniques for improving the signal-to-noise, are discussed. 730235. Aerodynamics of Passenger Vehicles in Close Proximity to Trucks and Buses. Robert K. Heffley, Systems Technology, Inc. This paper presents the results of wind tunnel experiments in which force and moment data were measured for a variety of passenger and recreational vehicles in the presence of an intercity bus and a tractor plus semitrailer truck. The disturbed vehicles studied include a sedan, station wagon, compact sedan, van, truck/camper, and station wagon towing a trailer. A description of the apparatus is given along with details of the scale models used. Basic lateral-directional aerodynamic data for the passenger vehicles alone are shown for yaw angles up to 105 deg. Force and moment data for the vehicles in the presence of the disturbing truck or bus are shown for varying lateral separation and longitudinal positions of the two vehicles, as well as the relative crosswind angle. Critical conditions for a large disturbance due to a truck or bus are discussed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730236. Exhaust Flow Pattern Study in a Wind Tunnel. Henry E. Pringham and William D. Bowman, Ford Motor Co. A new test procedure has been devised which provides an accurate, low cost method for studying the effect of exhaust tailpipe configuration on the smoke pattern behind an automobile. In this experiment motion picture records were made of the pattern and behavior of smoke laden engine exhaust behind a typical sedan automobile. These were compared with similar photographs obtained with smoke discharged from the dummy exhaust system of a V8 size model of the car in a carefully controlled wind tunnel test. A uniformly excellent geometrical similarity was found to exist be- tween model and full-scale test results that held through- out the variety of tailpipe configuration and operation mode combinations tested in the investigation. The results show that wind tunnel tests with the model are technically equivalent to the performance of the actual vehicle. Therefore, wind tunnel tests on models can be used to facilitate the design of exhaust system config- urations that minimize or eliminate undesirable exhaust behavior characteristics. This is an extremely significant result because such models are, or can be, available far in advance of driveable prototype vehicles. It is technically possible, therefore, to determine undesirable exhaust flow behavior and devise possible solutions before the car design reaches the prototype development phase. A description is given of the smoke generating and photographic equipment used with the full-size vehicle and with its V$ scale model. 730237. Airflow Phenomena In the Louvered-Fin Heat Exchanger. L. T. Wong, Ford Motor Co.; and M. C. Smith, Michigan State Univ. 730235-730240 Experiments were performed with a 5:1 scale model of a portion of a typical louvered-fin heat-exchanger core in a controlled turbulence wind tunnel to determine whether full-scale heat-exchanger characteristics could be obtained from large-scale data. The air-pressure drop and heat- transfer rate of the model core were measured and compared with the full-scale data in terms of drag coefficient and Nusselt number as a function of Reynolds number based on the face velocity. These data showed a close correlation between the model and full-scale cores. It is concluded that the airflow phenomena are similar for the full-scale and model cores. In addition to the pressure drop and heat-transfer measurements, distributions of air speed and air temper- ature at selected locations in the wake were taken with hot wire and thermocouple probes. These distributions pro- vided a detailed description of local airflow phenomena in the core. 730238. An Aerodynamic Test Facility for Scale Model Automobiles. William T. Mason, Jr., Paul S. Beebe and Franz K. Schenkel, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. 1 A facility for the aerodynamic testing of scale model vehicles has been developed. Suitable test section geom- etry, ground plane simulation, model setup technique, flow quality, and aerodynamic force and moment meas- urement capability are provided for automobile models from 1/4-3/8 scale. The maximum velocity of 160 mph enables 3/8 scale, 120 in wheelbase vehicles to be tested at Reynolds numbers approaching 5 X 106, based on wheelbase. A 3/8 scale model in a 160 mph airstream is dynamically similar to full-scale tests at 60 mph. Details of the facility are described. 1973 SA E Transactions 730239. The New Chrysler Wind Tunnel. Jerry P. Lind- say and Harold E. Lanktree, Chrysler Corp. The Chrysler wind tunnel is a closed-circuit, single-return, semiopen jet facility used for performing engine cooling, transmission cooling, engine compartment airflow, under- hood component temperature, air-conditioning, and other types of tests. It operates over a 0-120 mph speed range with 400 hp rear-wheel power absorption capacity. Special provisions have been made for idle, city traffic, and tail wind tests. Facility controls provide precise set-point capability, and comprehensive instrumentation and data acquisition systems permit measurement of many param- eters and real time data reduction. 730240. Diesel Engine and Highway Truck Noise Reduc- tion. Roy M. Law, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp.

Influence of Operating Cycle on Noise of Diesel Engines. D. Anderton and J. Baker, Southamp- ton University (England). The fundamental effect that cycle difference of a recip- rocating internal combustion engine has on noise and performance, together with noise and vibration charac- teristics of 2- and 4-cycle diesel engines, is described. Some of the conclusions drawn from extensive noise and vibration measurements include: 1. Variation in engine surface vibration and noise radiated is linearly related to a force input applied to the structure. 2. A method of predicting combustion noise levels of current automotive diesel engines. 3. A combination of engine performance calculations with relations for predicting overall engine noise in initial design stages. 1973 SA E Transactions 730242. Noise of Small Indirect Injection Diesel Engines. W. M. Scott, Ricardo &amp; Co. Engineers (1927) Ltd. A study of all aspects of noise generated by small indirect injection diesel engines has been made, primarily aimed at the reduction of idling noise. This is a major problem in the application of diesel engines to taxis and light commercial vehicles when compared with the gasoline engine. The inherent advantage shown by the indirect injec- tion system, in terms of smoke, noise, and gaseous emissions, is resulting in an extension of its application into larger commercial vehicles. Combustion is shown to be the major noise source under both idling and high-load, high-speed conditions, and means of reducing this by control of fuel injection are described, together with the reduction of the other noise sources contributing to the annoyance aspect of idling noise. 730243. Automotive Deisel Engine Noise and Its Control. M. F. Russell, C.A.V. Ltd. (England). There is now a growing interest in every means of reducing the noise of current diesel engines and designing even quieter engines for the future, perhaps as awareness of noise as a social problem becomes widespread. This paper discusses the production of engine noise, its transmission through the structure, and its subsequent radiation as a sequence of events. Diesel engine noise can originate from several me- chanical sources such as piston slap, timing gear rattle, etc. as well as from the sharp rise in cylinder pressure which attends combustion. The relative importance of these sources is affected by clearances between the working parts which are dictated by design and manu- facturing constraints. If reduction of noise at source is contemplated, it is necessary to diagnose which of these sources are primarily responsible for the noise, bearing in mind that the relative importance of the sources varies with engine load and speed. The diagnosis of sources can be based upon measurements of combustion spectra at various engine conditions. Engine noise may be reduced either at source or by reducing the vibration of the external surfaces of the engine. If reduction of noise by treatment of the surface panels and covers is contemplated, it is generally neces- sary to treat all the thin section areas (for example, crankcase, water jacket, sump, valve gear covers, etc.). However it is useful to be able to locate any areas which do not contribute significantly to the overall noise. Techniques to find the important noise-radiating areas of the engine surface are discussed prior to a brief consid- eration of noise reduction measures. 1 973 SA E Transactions 730244. The Use of Specially Designed Covers and Shields to Reduce Diesel Engine Noise. Gerhard E. Thien, AVL-Institute Prof. List (Austria). Possibilities of design and construction are presented by which the noise radiated by the surface of an engine can be reduced. Vibration isolation, stiffening, or sound-reducing shells, can be applied within comparatively short time; however, their effect on reducing the total noise is restricted to about 5 dBA. Total enclosure of the engine is highly effective. In this particular design, the space requirement is comparatively small, the weight increase is not too excessive, sound absorbing material in the clearance is not required, and the noise reduction achieved is as high as 15-20 dBA. New design concepts, taking into account acoustical principles right from the start, will be the most economical approach for the future. Knowledge of the structure-borne sound within the engine is essential in this respect; particularly, further knowledge gained through tests on the nonrunning engine, using a "banger rig" for simu- lating combustion excitation. 1973 SA E Transactions 730245. Diesel Engine Noise Reduction by Combustion and Structural Modifications. D. D. Tiede and D. F. Kabele, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. Diesel engine noise can be reduced by modifying the combustion pressure-time history and the engine struc- ture. This paper deals with the correlation between combustion excitation level and noise, and the effects of speed, timing, load, compression ratio, and combustion system configuration on combustion excitation. Engine structural modifications including increased stiffness, isolation, and damping are considered. The effects on noise and vibration are presented for increased block stiffness and isolation and damping of various engine covers. 730246. Design Aspects of Low-Noise Diesel Engines. S. H. Jenkins, Cummins Engine Co., Inc.; N. Lalor 114</page><page sequence="38">and E. C. Grover, University of Southampton (England). Methods of reducing the noise level of a diesel engine include the suppression of the major modes of block vibration and treatment of the external surfaces. Design methods enable the frequencies and noise levels of these modes to be calculated for a conventionally designed engine. The important modes of vibration, the noise signature and the effect of block modifications of a standard production V-8 engine were found by experiments. These provided the basis for the design of an experimental low-noise engine. Design features include a stiffer block, removal of the bottom part of the crankcase skirt, the addition of a single bearing beam, and the use of isolated panels and damped surfaces. The noise reduction ob- tained as 9 dBA. Most of this is due to the use of isolated and damped nonload carrying surfaces. 1973 SA E Transactions T3V2A1. A Study of Valve Train Noises and A Method of Cam Design to Reduce the Noises. Masanori Hanaoka and Sadafumi Fukumura, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. Valve train noises at low engine speeds include noises that occur at the instant the valve opens and closes, and those that occur while the follower is on the cam lobe. Former valve noises are caused by impacts, and their sound intensity is proportional to the impact speed. Latter noises are caused by frictional vibrations due to metal-to-metal contact at points where oil film thicknesses becomes zero. Irregular contact surfaces increase these noises. Valve train noises at high engine speeds are caused by irregular valve behavior. The profile of the new cam design is expressed by "n"-th order Fourier series in 360 deg * continuously, and has no high-order harmonics that resonate with the natural frequency of the valve train. Its wide parameter permits design of a most reasonable acceleration curve. Valve motion is thus improved and noise is reduced. 1973 SAE Transactions 730248. A Zinc-Chloride Battery - The Missing Link to a Practical Electric Car. C. J. Amato, Oxy Metal Finishing Corp. In order to prove the scale-up feasibility of a new battery system, a full-scale experimental package has been built and tested in a modified 1971 Vega Hatchback. Employ- ing the zinc-chlorine couple, this unique system uses the solid, icelike compound chlorine hydrate to store chlorine safely and conveniently. The developmental hardware and some aspects of its design are described. A discussion of the complete electrical propulsion system is presented. Details of the system auxiliaries, electrical controls, and vehicle instrumentation are also included. It is concluded that the zinc-chloride battery is a 730247-730251 viable solution to the principal problem impeding the development of electric cars - a high power, high energy density battery. 730249. Electric Van for Metropolitan Service. Donald Gates and Michael Pocobello, Antares Engi- neering, Inc. When a survey of light truck operators established that many of these operators' vehicle requirements could be satisfied by an electric vehicle, Copper Development Association Inc. commissioned the design and construc- tion of such a vehicle. Because this vehicle was intended for electrical propulsion and designed from the ground up for this, rather than being a modification of an existing vehicle, primary design objectives were to meet estab- lished performance requirements and to minimize weight, wing resistance and mechanical losses. This paper dis- cusses the design and development of the vehicle, called the Copper Electric Van Model III. 730250. How Do You Characterize "Performance"? Dale Kelly, Consultant. This paper calls attention to the multiplicity of numerical criteria in common use to characterize the ability of land vehicles to accelerate and to climb hills; these include a variety of relations between speed, time and distance from a standing start, gradability, and instantaneous accel- eration. The procedure for converting from one criterion to another is not always obvious. To accelerate or climb hills, all a vehicle needs is a tractive effort (or horsepower) at the driving wheels which exceeds the requirement for constant speed on a level road. The ratio of excess tractive effort to vehicle weight, sometimes defined as "performance," is a particularly convenient criterion of ability to accelerate and climb hills because it is numerically almost equal to the percent grade at constant speed, divided by 100, and to the level road acceleration expressed as a fraction of the acceleration of gravity (22 miles/h/s). A convenient way to measure this ratio is with a performance meter, similar in construction to a grade meter or "accelerometer"; certain limitations of this instrument are discussed. Performance is more commonly measured by tests of level road acceleration or speed on known grades; to perform both of these tests often involves needless duplication. Another convenient criterion of vehicle ability is reserve horsepower per pound, equal to performance times speed, in miles per hour, divided by 375. The paper describes procedures for converting from the relation between speed and excess tractive effort (or horsepower) to a description or the standing start acceleration, and vice-versa. 730251. Modeling and Testing of Storage Batteries. K. R. Kleckner, Oakland University. This paper develops and evaluates an elementary elec- trical circuit model for a storage cell. The model is applied 115</page><page sequence="39">730252-730259 to both lead-acid and nickel-cadmium cells. It exhibits the appropriate terminal voltage, current behavior and, for lead-acid batteries, the observed nonreciprocal power- energy relationship. The circuit model provides an accurate simulation of electric vehicle propulsion batter- ies, enabling vehicle designers to make good preliminary evaluations of driving range under a variety of conditions, including urban driving cycles. Also described is a programmable battery test stand which can simulate an electric vehicle under these same conditions and provide direct measurements of battery capacity. 730252. The Dynamic Characterization of Lead-Acid Batteries for Vehicie Applications. D. F. Taylor and E. G. Siwek, General Electric Co. A computerized method of load profile analysis has been developed for predicting how electric vehicles with well-defined power requirements will perform with readily available batteries. Utilizing characterization curves which are usually available from the manufacturer for the battery model in question, or experimentally obtained voltage/time signature curves for several constant-current discharges, the technique permits evaluation of vehicle range capabilities with load profiles in which capacity recuperation is an important factor. Time to cutoff calculations on both square wave and electric vehicle current-time curves are shown to give good agreement with the experimental results of corroborating discharge tests conducted with a programmed load simulator. 730253. Batteries for Practical Electric Cars. Philip C. Symons, Oxy Metal Finishing Corp. The factors necessary to design a battery system for commercial electric cars are analyzed. A new battery system, involving zinc and chlorine as the active elements, and utilizing chlorine hydrate as a means of storing chlorine, is presented. It is shown that this new system meets all the requirements for practical electric cars. Data on the operating characteristics of batteries based on the zinc/chlorine hydrate system are given. Operating per- formances of an electric car based on this battery are presented. 730254. Electric Vehicle Hybrid Power Train. George C. Kugler, ESB Inc. With the goal of reducing the high current peaks which occur in lead-acid batteries used for electric vehicles, a new power train incorporating an inertial storage device coupled to a continuously running electric motor has been designed. The power train consists in part of an electric motor designed for efficient operation over a narrow speed range. Once activated, the motor runs continuously even though the automobile is stopped; during the rest periods the motor stores energy in a kinetic device which acts as an energy load leveler. Such an electric motor- inertia hybrid power train has several advantages: high power output capability, all mechanical regenerative braking, extended battery life, increased electric motor efficiency, and elimination of expensive solid-state motor controllers. 730256.

(SP-375) Fundamentals of Dynamic Properties Measurement of Elastomers: Part I - Measure- ment and Identification Principles. Robert G. Leonard, Purdue University. The basic principles of parameter identification for a first-order dynamic model for an elastomer sample are presented.

(SP-375) Fundamentals of Dynamic Properties Measurement of Elastomers: Part II - Instru- mentation, Computation, and Compensation. Chester L. Nachtigal, Purdue University. Instrument requirements for determining the dynamic properties of elastomers are particularly stringent because of the inherently low phase shift between force and displacement. Some currently available instruments and their tradeoffs are briefly discussed. A basic concept of employing matching circuits to eliminate the necessity for measuring both of the across variables, namely, position and velocity, is described, as well as the computational circuits to recover the missing variable. A scheme for compensating the phase-lagging characteristics of the transducer-amplifier combination is also presented. 730259. (SP-375) Resonant Beam System Development - Past to Present. Floyd Brouwer, Vari-Tech Co. The purpose of this paper is to show the development of the Dynamic Rubber Test Machine as an engineering and production (quality control) tool from the standpoint of a machine supplier. Problems encountered in the design, fabrication, preshipment checkout, and installation of equipment into customer's facilities are discussed. Correlation of equip- ment is explored as it relates to the dynamic spring rate and the damping constant of elastomer products. Certain techniques and hardware adaptations have aided in improving the repeatability of tests of the resonant beam system. The information given is not intended to be all inclusive, but as a report of the work in this field to date. 116</page><page sequence="40">730260. (SP-375) Application of Electrohydraulic Test Machines to Dynamic Testing of Elastomers. J. Howell Owens, MTS Systems Corp. Closed loop electrohydraulic servo-controlled test ma- chines have gained rapid acceptance in the dynamic testing field. This paper describes the principles of a particular system designed for use in the Elastomer Test Laboratory. The paper will describe the basic principles of closed loop control, the techniques for calibration of instrumentation and scaling of signals, typical test operation and results, and a unique technique of readout for determining elastic spring rate and damping coef- ficient. 730261. (SP-375) Evolution and Uses of Transmitted Force Measurement. W. J. Wilson, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. It has long been recognized that there are problems in obtaining the desired accuracies in elastomer testing. Improvements in accuracy result from taking direct measurements of the displacement and the load generated across the sample being tested. This more direct method, called the Transmitted Force Method, is traced from its initial concept through its stages of development, by different investigators, to the present state-of-the-art. Included in this discussion is the basic concept and underlying theory of this test method, along with a description of measurement techniques. 730262. (SP-375) Computation and Direct Readout of Dynamic Properties: The Identifier. B. M. Hillberry, R. E. Goodson and C. L. Nachtigal, Purdue University. An instrumentation system is described which provides on-line computation and direct readout of C and K. The system relies on the measurement of force and dis- placement or velocity across the sample and is inde- pendent of the type of test machine. Errors introduced by unwanted phase shift in any instrumentation system are discussed. This is overcome in this measurement system by phase compensation. Calibration of the system is described in which an overall system accuracy can be determined independent of test machine or rubber sample. This system has been specifically designed for measurement of dynamic prop- erties of rubber and provides the operator with direct readout of C and K scaled to engineering units, thereby reducing potential operator error. 730263. (SP-375) An Application of Mini-Computers for the Determination of Elastomeric Damping Co- efficients and Other Properties. Donald M. Danko and James E. Svárovsky, Gilmore In- dustries, Inc. This paper describes a method for determining the dynamic properties of rubber compounds through the use of a dedicated mini-computer. Topics under discussion include the application of the Fast Fourier transform and 730260-730266 its inverse as a rapid method of determining an array of nonlinear coefficients that describe the component force vectors. A discussion of the controlling algorithms in the determination of the dynamic spring rate, nonlinear damping coefficients, and hysteretic energy absorption through the implementation of the Fast Fourier transform is presented. The advantages of this method include relatively low cost, fast results, and simplicity of opera- tion. The implementation of the mini-computer toward this application opens a new field for developing com- pounds with low damping coefficients where present methods of measurement may not yield consistent results. Test efficiency, repeatability, and reduction of devel- opment costs are the principal advantages. Added spe- cialized algorithms can be introduced at minimum cost as the state-of-the-art develops. 730264. (SP-375) Correlation of Dynamic Properties Test Equipment. J. E. Nemec, General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. The search for greater accuracy and precision in the measurement of dynamic properties of elastomeric com- ponents used in the automotive industry is a never-ending endeavor. This paper considers the statistical approach to designed experiments for evaluation of individual test machine repeatability and test machine differences. The approach is a discussion of the "Analysis of Variance" (ANOVA) technique and the mechanics of solution. The accuracy and precision variables are then applied to the technique for analysis. Included are the results of a precision error experiment conducted at General Tire and a round-robin test program, which was conducted through the joint ASTM-SAE Technical Committees on Auto- motive Rubber (TCAR Section 11.65B), both using the ANOVA statistical approach. The MTS 830 employing the transmitted force test method was used in the round-robin. 730265. (SP-375) Error Analysis of the Resonant Beam Rubber Testing Machine. A. S. Paul, Noise &amp; Vibrations Lab., General Motors Corp.; and B. M. Hillberry, Purdue University. Dynamic analysis of the resonant beam machine is presented. Equations typically used to determine the dynamic properties of a rubber product are derived from a simplified model. A complex mathematical model rep- resenting a more realistic parametric system identification is formulated. Using the complex model as standard, the errors in the results from the simplified model are identified quantitatively, and it is shown they can be considerable. The sensitivity of the errors to the system parameter variations is also shown. These machine errors may be virtually eliminated by measuring the transmitted force and displacement across the sample. 730266. (SP-375) Testing and Parameterization of Elasto- mers for Modeling of Linear Vibration Systems. A. D. Anderson, Ford Motor Co. 117</page><page sequence="41">730267-730273 Representation of elastomers for use in modeling of linear systems requires great care in the acquisition of test data. Current industry-standard test techniques are not ade- quate for quantitative description of elastomers, subjected to small amplitude sinusoidal excitation. Equally impor- tant to accurate dynamic testing of elastomers is para- meterization of the test data for use in modeling of systems. The paper discusses testing and parameterization techniques used to describe elastomers for use in a linear, low-frequency vibration model of an automobile. Accu- racy requirements of test instrumentation, selection of suitable linear elastomer models, and interpolating func- tions (used for equivalent linearization and ambient condition corrections) are discussed in some detail. 730267. (SP-375) Factors Controlling the Dynamic Prop- erties of Elastomeric Products. J. G. Sommer and D. A. Meyer, General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Selected compositional, processing, design, and testing factors are discussed with respect to their influence on the dynamic properties of elastomeric parts. Variations in rubbers, fillers, oils, and level of cross-linking produce specific changes in spring rate and damping coefficient. Processing factors such as mixing, curing, and storage are shown to have an important influence on dynamic properties. Design concepts relating material properties and the dynamic response of some simple shapes are reviewed, along with the effect of prestrain and strain history. 730268. (SP-375) The Effective Use of Dynamic Testing in Raw Materials Development Programs. Robert C. Puydak, Enjay Polymer Labs. Dynamic test equipment is used to characterize elastomers and compounding ingredients for the purpose of selecting those most suitable for the various types of dynamic mountings and to develop formulations with balanced properties. Key measurements include modulus under conditions of dynamic vibration, damping, and the ratios by which these quantities change with changes in frequency, amplitude, and temperature. By appropriate selection of test specimen configuration and test condi- tions, additional data are generated which can guide the designer in the most effective use of the materials available and help define the relationships between the properties of mound materials and their effectiveness in controlling vibrations in vehicles. 730269. (SP-375) Production and Quality Control of Elastomer Mounts. R. R. Koons, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. With the increasing emphasis on the dynamic perform- ance of elastomer mounts, the rubber manufacturer has been required to develop, produce, and control elastomer mounts with more versatility and precision than ever before. To accomplish this, the rubber manufacturer has become more involved with dynamic testing and dynamic performance while working closer with the automotive industry on cooperative engineering programs and cor- relation testing. This paper will discuss the manufacturer's role in preproduction engineering programs and requirements, production control of mounts, and control related cor- relation. 730270. (SP-376) Rubber Springs. Wallace G. Chalmers, Chalmers Suspensions International Ltd. Design, development, and application of a compression type 100% rubber spring has proved to be very successful on single and tandem axle suspensions for trucks and trailers. Among the objectives of the rubber spring were a free height, not to exceed 8 in, static capacity of approximately 20,000 lb, a load deflection of about 3 in, and a life of 500,000 miles or more. Desirable characteristics have proved to be smooth ride due to low frequency of pitch, minimum of side sway or roll, long life - no spring has yet worn out despite hundreds of thousands of miles of service. 730271. (SP-376) Variable Rate Leaf Springs - Their Design and Characteristics. Fred Rowland, North American Rockwell Corp. (Retired). The design analysis for a variable rate spring has been simplified by using an example which is symmetrical. In order for the variable rate spring to produce the desired ride qualities, specifications must establish rate curves - load and load height for the first, and also for the second, stages. Variable rate springs have the potential of improved ride quality over a wide load range, provided an adequate total deflection can be accommodated on the vehicle and the springs are designed correctly, with specifications which include control for manufacturing to obtain desired spring rates. 730272. (SP-376) Two Stage Multileaf Spring Design. Jurgis Mikaila, Chevrolet Engrg. Center, Gen- eral Motors Corp. This paper describes the exact method which the author derived, for designing a two-stage leaf spring. The spring consists of a multileaf first stage, and tapered-leaf second stage. Using this method, the following can be deter- mined: 1. Spring rates and stresses when all physical dimen- sions are known. 2. Leaf thickness and stresses for given rates. In the Appendix of this paper, a sample of a step-by-step calculation is given, which makes the whole problem easier to understand. 730273. (SP-376) Principles and Application of Pneu- matic Springs.

The basic flow and heat transfer properties of monolithic ceramic structures are described and related to their use as supports for catalysts to control automobile pollutants. The critical mechanical and thermal properties of suitable ceramic structures are presented along with comparative test methods and results. The importance of micro- structure, phase stability, porosity, pore size, open frontal area, cell size, wall thickness, density, and uniformity are discussed. Engine durability results are given for several typical monolith coating catalyst systems. 730275. The Single Stone-Monolith Substrate as a Catal- ytic Unit for Auto Emission Control. Warren S. Briggs and James R. Graham, W. R. Grace &amp; Co. Temperature requirements of 1800-2000 F impose a near-ceramic approach to the application catalysts for auto emission control, and the unit structure or monolith substrate is discussed in terms of its specific requirements. Surface modification to include high-surface-area coatings for optimum dispersion of active components is of primary consideration. In addition, progress is reported on some of the approaches to the problem of blending normal catalyst properties for low-temperature activity with the ceramic requirements and high-temperature exposure. Performance data from laboratory experiments and FTP-CVS evaluation tests are discussed in relation to contact time, material transport, geometric configuration, and aging. Physical durability, which is influenced by inherent structural properties of the monolith, must be capable of coping with extreme demands created by the continuously changing conditions within the catalytic unit. The status of some of the problems and their implications are reviewed. 730276. Active Aluminas as Catalyst Supports for Treat- ment of Automotive Exhaust Emissions. Harry E. Osment, Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. This paper serves as an introduction to the technology of alumina catalyst supports and relates physical and 730274-730278 chemical properties of aluminas to the critical properties of finished catalysts. Although the emphasis here is upon the design of particulate catalyst supports, the treatment is sufficiently broad to be applicable in part to the use of aluminas in other ways, such as for coatings on other substrates. The information presented will be of greatest interest to those directly involved in catalyst development and manufacture, representing the viewpoint of a supplier of raw materials and formed alumina substrates to the catalyst industry. However, it may also appeal to those wishing to develop a further background on catalyst properties and gain some understanding of the limitations of feasible design of catalysts, which, in turn, often depends upon the flexibility and limitations of the catalyst support employed. A number of physical property measurements impor- tant to overall converter operation, and thus technical considerations of importance to the catalyst support material alone are briefly described. 730277. Control of Automotive Emissions by Particulate Catalysts. James F. Roth and James W. Gam- bell, Monsanto Co. Particulate catalysts, consisting of porous solid particles, have been under intensive development for the control of automotive emissions. Such catalysts contain base metal and/or noble metal active components dispersed on high surface area alumina supports. Consideration is given to the physical and chemical properties of both supports and catalysts, and to the relationship between some of these properties and catalytic performance. It has been found that low bulk density and the presence of macroporosity improve conversion efficiency. At high temperatures, transformation of the support from a high surface area alumina to crystalline alpha alumina causes shrinkage, a deterioration of mechanical properties, and catalyst deactivation. Support interactions with certain activity promoters accelerate this adverse transformation. Stabi- lizers have been found that repress the alpha alumina transformation. Base metal catalysts are extremely sen- sitive to sulfur poisoning. Resistance to sulfur poisoning can be increased substantially by promotion of base metal catalysts with noble metals. 1973 SAE Transactions 730278. Simplified Three-Dimensional Photogrammetric Analysis of Moving Bodies. I. W. Kay and E. C. Zobel, Wayne State University. Accurate values of velocity and acceleration of a point on an impacting vehicle are determined by Wayne State University (WSU) personnel using a simple but flexible three-dimensional photogrammetric technique requiring little site preparation and no knowledge of the quanti- tative optical properties of the cameras. A computer program was developed to locate the point in space as it moves and to calculate its position, velocity and accel- eration vectors as functions of time. Curve smoothing is 119</page><page sequence="43">730279-730284 accomplished in the computer program by means of a special algorithm designed to reduce the effects of random measurement errors, which are greatly magnified in the calculation of velocity and acceleration. 730279. Faceted Reflector Fog Lamp Eliminates Lens Fluting. R. J. Donohue and B. W. Joseph, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. In the faceted reflector design for automotive lamps, the reflector is divided into easy-to-fabricate, circular cylin- drical segments (facets) in a manner such that the reflector alone produces the beam pattern. The prescription for the facets is developed with the aid of computer programs which simulate the images from each facet and "build up" the desired light pattern mathematically, thus eliminating the normal "cut-and-try" experimental buildup. The design procedure was applied to a fog lamp with a 55 W, quartz-halogen bulb and several prototypes have been constructed. The broad beam pattern from these lamps is most suitable for driving in a fog and the lamp with a clear lens offers styling flexibility. The faceted reflector concept can also be applied to headlamps, driving lamps, and signal lamps. 1973 SA E Transactions 730280. General Motors Experimental Safety Vehicle - Powertrain and Fuel System. Floyd A. Wyc- zalek, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp., Thomas R. Leonard, Oldsmobile Div., General Motors Corp.; and Donald W. Peterson, Buick Motor Div., General Motors Corp. The Experimental Safety Vehicle powertrain and fuel system developed by General Motors in compliance with Contract DOT-OS-00095 with the U. S. Department of Transportation include several special features: a low engine accessory package to meet the front visibility down angle of 8 deg, engine and transmission mounting for retention at high decelerations, a light aluminum engine, an over-the-rear-axle fuel tank, and a unique evaporative emission fuel pipe routing. A comprehensive test program was planned and final testing to validate contract specifications was conducted. 730281. The Problem of Interpretation of Tire Skid Test Results - The Interaction of Variations in Speed, Water Depth, and Surface with Tire Coefficients. R. N. Kienle, Uniroyal Tire Co. This paper explores some methods for circumventing the difficulties in interpretation of skid and traction tests caused by variations in speed, water depth, and road surface. Testing data are analyzed with a new approach using a graph of peak coefficient against slide coefficient. These analyses show that the tire and surface do not change greatly in basic frictional response as test speed changes. However changes in coefficient do occur on most wet surfaces as the test speed is varied. Data indicate this to be the result of changes in the percentage of the tire penetrating the water film to reach the road surface. Data obtained under nearly identical conditions on different days vary. Least variation occurs in the low- speed peak coefficients, the slide coefficients, and the sum of these coefficients obtained either on dry surfaces or on surfaces wet with very think water films. The vector line recording the change of the wet peak and slide coefficients as they vary with speed is useful in determining the quantity of water depth actually present on a surface. Methods of using these data are suggested which reduce the testing variation under all conditions, help to characterize surfaces, adjust data for day-to-day test variation in water depth, and interpret the data in a more meaningful manner. 730282. Electric Trailer Brakes. Donald D. Brown, Kelsey-Hayes Co. The added weight of the towed vehicle has always made extra braking capacity essential in trailer applications, and electric braking systems have been preferred for this service since the expansion of the industry that began after World War II. The typical system consists of a hydraulically braked tow vehicle equipped with an electric brake controller that is connected through a wiring harness to the electrically braked trailer. The paper describes present size ranges and appli- cations of electric brakes and illustrates the most popular type of controller - the hydraulically actuated unit - as well as a self-actuated controller. Auxiliary control units are named, and the advantages of electric brakes are listed. 730283. The Basics of Inertia-Operated Hydraulic Trailer Braking. E. DeAngelis, Toledo Stamping &amp; Mfg. Co. A hydraulic trailer brake system that requires no connec- tion to the towing vehicle's brake system, permits liberal towing vehicle interchangeability, and operates automat- ically in proportion to trailer weight and towing vehicle deceleration, is operated by a device mounted on the trailer tongue. It also provides emergency breakaway braking without an auxiliary power source. The author discusses principles and characteristics of this inertia- operated system. 730284. Injuries in Collisions Involving Small Cars in Europe. Murray Mackay and Steve Ashton, University of Birmingham (United Kingdom). Some of the characteristics of traffic accidents involving small cars in Europe are reviewed. A classification procedure is suggested whereby crashes may be categoriz- ed by their equivalent test in the laboratory. A sample of accidents is used to illustrate this procedure and the collision characteristics. The limited relevance of the distributed frontal barrier test to real world accidents is shown. Examples of particular features which produce 120</page><page sequence="44">injury are illustrated by cases. Three-point belts are discussed, and some injuries associated with poor po- sitioning are illustrated. Small car steering assembly design is mentioned because field experience suggests that actual function of the steering assemblies in crashes is still not optimal. Problems of seat deformation and mounting failures in relation to injury patterns are discussed briefly, and the crash performance of glass reinforced plastics is mentioned. 1973 SA E Transactions 730285. Vcon 3006 Truck - Extending Tire Capacity Through Innovation. Nick Petelski and Leo Davis, Peerless Manufacturing Co. The world's largest mining end dump truck, the Vcon 3006, utilizes several innovations to raise vehicle per- formance limitations significantly and to increase the productivity/operating cost. Its capability of hauling 250 tons on eight 36.00 X 51 tires with equal load distribution and reduced load variations at increased ton mph values is provided by a walking beam frame and four independent- ly suspended oscillating bogeys on liquid spring suspen- sion struts. Individually powered wheels with single tires provide exceptional traction and reduce tire scrubbing in turns to a minimum. The improvement of tire life that this vehicle concept demonstrates is of major importance to the utilization of large trucks. Its 3000 hp diesel locomotive engine provides a low fuel consumption, high performance, and reliability unmatched for a vehicle in this class. The Vcon 3006 design concept provides flexibility to match power requirements to the job and has potential for future trolley or gas turbine applications. 1973 SA E Transactions 730286. Status of International Noise Certification Stan- dards for Business Aircraft. Robert L. Paullin, U. S. Dept. of Transportation. Business aircraft - a nongeneric term to certification authorities - are being given increased attention by na- tional and international bodies concerned with noise reduction. This paper reviews the efforts of these groups from a regulatory standpoint. The status of domestic requirements in the United States and abroad is pre- sented. Technical procedures of promulgated and pro- posed standards are discussed. Business aircraft are separated into turbojet-powered and propeller-driven categories, and each is presented in terms of recent certification experience. The relationship between domes- tic certification programs and those of the International Civil Aviation Organization, and between domestic and foreign programs are presented. Finally, a brief look is taken into the future for the efficacy of business aircraft noise certification programs. 730287. Progress in the Development of Optimally Quiet Turboprop Engines and Installations. Richard N. 730285-730290 Tedrick and Roger W. Heldenbrand, AiRe- search Mfg. Co. of Arizona. A program, under the sponsorship of the U.S. Air Force Aero Propulsion Laboratory, is now under way to provide the computational tools necessary to predict noise sig- natures for small turbopropulsion engines and to design attenuation equipment as required to meet specific low-noise goals. The 24 month program, scheduled for completion in August 1973, involves the analysis of turbine engine noise prediction and attenuation methods, as well as the experimental verification of these analyses with full-scale hardware. This paper reviews the meth- odology development phases and examines acoustical data from bare and attenuated engine tests. 730288. New Low Pressure Ratio Fans for Quiet Business Aircraft Propulsion. Frederick B. Metzger and Rose Worobel, Hamilton Standard Div., United Aircraft Corp. Within the next few years tighter restrictions on general aviation aircraft noise are expected. It is anticipated that these noise restrictions, like those imposed on larger transport aircraft now certified under Federal Aircraft Regulations, will be revised downward over a period of time. While it is expected that initial restrictions can be met by the current propeller technology, the larger lower tip speed propellers necessary to meet succeedingly more stringent restrictions may prove difficult to accept. In this paper an alternative to the propeller as a propulsor for general aviation aircraft is discussed. This is the subsonic tip speed low-pressure ratio fan which can be mated to turboshaft, rotary combustion, or reciprocating engines to provide a low noise propulsor in a small package. Information is presented which shows tradeoffs among noise, weight, size, cost, and performance. Examples are included to show the influence of various noise targets on fan configuration and engine muffler requirements. 730289. "Quiet" Aspects of the Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft JT15D Turbofan. J. C. Plucinsky, United Air- craft of Canada Ltd. This paper describes the engine design details of the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT15D-1 engine as related to noise generation. Design principles and factors contributing to the very low-noise levels on the Cessna Citation aircraft are illustrated. Noise testing experiences and data from static tests on the United Aircraft of Canada Ltd. (UACL) flight test aircraft and from both static and flight tests on the Citation aircraft are discussed. Lessons learned from these tests and some future probabilities are outlined. 730290. Evaluation of Crashworthiness Test Data. Rich- ard F. Chandler, Civil Aeromedicai Institute, FAA. Increased concern regarding occupant protection for aircraft crashes has expanded efforts toward development of crashworthy aircraft systems. The purpose of a crashworthy seat, restraint or interior design is to reduce 121</page><page sequence="45">730291-730298 the probability and severity of injury to the occupant during a crash. In order to evaluate the performance of those systems before they are placed into production, the designer should consider the value of proper dynamic testing. The results of dynamic tests should indicate the likelihood of injury to the aircraft occupant. However, test results can be greatly influenced by test techniques. This paper presents current approaches to evaluating dynamic test results in terms of likelihood of injury to the human occupant, discusses the limitations and background of those approaches, and presents technical considerations for selection and use of anthropomorphic dummies, test conduct, etc. 1973 SA E Transactions 730291. Current Developments in Restraint Systems. L. E. Morgan, Pacific Scientific Co. There are many different types of lap belt and shoulder harness systems being installed on present production aircraft. It is the intent of this paper to show that there are different needs for the different types of restraint systems. There are sound and logical reasons why the many different types of aircraft have not adapted the same type of system for positioning and restraining the individual in his seated position. A review of the latest systems and reasons why they are used is a simple way of explaining why we have these many different types of systems. 730293. FAA General Aviation Crashworthiness Program. A. F. Madayag, Federal Aviation Administra- tion. This paper discusses in depth the FAA Crashworthiness Program for small airplanes (propeller-driven) and the on-going efforts being undertaken by various federal agencies in support of this program. The interrelationship of the three prime areas in aviation safety, airworthiness, % human factors, and crashworthiness is pointed out. Earlier emphasis had been placed chiefly on airworthiness with some improvements in the human factor area such as flight-training curriculums. While an improvement in any of these three prime areas will better the safety records, airplane crashes continue to occur in the face of earlier achievements. Emphasis is now increasingly being direct- ed toward crashworthiness, the main objective of which is to provide the best practical crash protection thus increasing occupant survivability. It is hoped that the anticipated involvement of the general aviation industry in crashworthiness will continue and increase. 730294. Wake Turbulence and Its Elimination. James F. Marchman, III, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. Wake turbulence dominates much current discussion regarding aircraft operation problems. This problem is more severe for business aircraft than it is for airline operations because of the smaller size of the business planes and their subsequent greater chance for damage in a vortex encounter. The results of a detailed wind tunnel study of the structure of the trailing vortex to distances of 30 chord lengths downstream of the wing are reported. Five different means of reducing the dangerous high-swirl velocities in a vortex are described and their effects on the wake are illustrated. The effects of these possible vortex "fixes" on the wing itself as well as the possibility of using these or other devices to accelerate the dissipation of wake turbulence are discussed. It is concluded that vortex dissipation within 20-30 chord lengths downstream of the generating wing will be possible in the very near future. 730295. Flight Test Studies of the Formation and Dis- sipation of Trailing Vortices. Howard Chevalier, Texas A&amp;M University. A flight test program has been conducted to measure experimentally parameters that describe the character- istics of vortex instability and behavior. Three basic atmospheric flight conditions were investigated: steady, level flight in calm air; steady, level flight in light gusting air and light winds; and unsteady flight produced by control surface oscillations in calm air. A DeHavilland Beaver DHC-2 airplane and a Beechcraft T-34B airplane were used in the investigation. Smoke grenades were located near the wing tips of each airplane such that the vortices could be seeded with smoke and thus made visible. This made it possible to take measurements from photographs of the visible vortices. The experimental results show wavelengths of vortex instabilities, dissi- pation times of trailing vortices, effects of atmospheric current or gust, and the effect of control surface oscillation. These data provide additional experimental verification of the existence of vortex wake instability predicted by theory and show that small oscillations in pitch at a critical frequency accelerate the dissipation of high-intensity vortices. 730296. Aircraft- Vortex Penetration. Robert C. Nelson and Barnes W. McCormick, U. S. Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab. During the past several years the problem of wake turbulence has received considerable attention. As a result of research programs sponsored by the Federal Gov- ernment and private industry, the hazard of wake turbulence to light aircraft has been well documented. In this paper it is emphasized that relatively large aircraft can also be susceptible to vortices generated by large jet transports. This conclusion is based upon a review of accident records and the results from a computer simulation of the aircraft-vortex interaction. The com- puter simulation consists of the equations of motion with six degrees of freedom as well as control input by the pilot. Procedures are recommended for avoiding dangerous vortex encounters. 730298. Some Effects of Camber on Swept-Back Wings. Melvin H. Snyder, Jr., Wichita State University. The effects of camber of airfoil sections and wings on the pitching moment coefficient (DM) and on life coefficient 122</page><page sequence="46">(Clo) are examined. Except for changes in CM caused by the wing planform, not-so-slender wings behave similarly to the airfoil sections. The effects of wing planform geometry, however, often overpower the section char- acteristics. This is particularly true of slender wings with their highly cambered sections which may have multiple sets of coronet vortices. Wind tunnel tests are compared with the tests of Nangia and Hancock to investigate the mechanism of vortex lift on a cambered wing. 730299. Electric Trim Systems: Design and Certification Considerations Under FAR 23.677 (Cam 3337- 2). James L. Irwin and Harold W. Holdeman, Edo-Aire Mitchell. The FAA uses the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) as the criteria for the approval and certification of all aircraft and appliance designs. In addition to assuring that systems will perform their intended function, the FARs attempt to maximize safety and utility. Recent changes in the official interpretation of the Regulations have caused changes in the performance and certification procedures of electric trim systems. An understanding of these changes is essential for anyone working in the design and/or certification of these systems. 730300. New Handle for Nickel-Cadmium Batteries. H. A. Slingsby, Beech Aircraft Corp.; and John M. Evjen, General Electric Co. The process of applying aircraft batteries to gas turbine engine starting systems has long been either by trial and error or by a rather lengthy, drawn-out analytical process. A convenient descriptive value for the battery char- acteristic, which is significant in engine starting, is now available. This characteristic is conveniently evaluated for any battery design using relatively simple equipment. This measurement is then self-sufficient for determining the engine starting performance of that battery. This paper discusses a convenient measurement for describing the gas turbine engine starting capability of nickel-cadmium batteries and the usefulness of that measurement in applying a battery to a starting system. A description of the measurement of the power delivery capability of a battery is presented, along with a discussion of the reasoning for selection of the secondary rating conditions. The results of an evaluation of the engine starting requirements of the Beech E-90 are presented. Those results demonstrate the usefulness of this technique to describe the battery needs for an existing system. Only by accurate description of the true require- ments of various applications can the development efforts of battery manufacturers be brought to bear on filling those requirements in an optimum manner. 730301. What is Your Altitude? S. R. Teigland, The Bendix Corp. The design and development of an encoding altimeter incorporating a new method of display and an improved 730299-730305 coding scheme for the transmission of altitude infor- mation to air traffic controllers in presented. 730303. Control-Configured General Aviation Aircraft. F. H. Lutze and E. M. Cliff, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The concept of designing general aviation aircraft to take advantage of recent advances in control technology is presented. Particular attention is paid to relaxing the inherent static stability requirements of the airframe and assuming that stability can be maintained by the control system. As an example, the longitudinal static stability of a typical twin-engine business aircraft is considered. It is shown that the horizontal tail area can be reduced 60% by considering only longitudinal control requirements. This reduction in tail area leads to improvements in the selected performance parameters of range, rate of climb, and maximum level speed. In addition, it is shown that there is more freedom in center of gravity position with the aft limit determined by control power requirements rather than by the usual static stability requirement. 730304. Separate Surfaces for Automatic Flight Controls. Jan Roskam, University of Kansas; M. R. Barber and Paul C. Loschke, Flight Research Center, NASA. The purpose of this paper is to describe an investigation of separate surface stability augmentation systems for gen- eral aviation aircraft. The program objectives were twofold: First a wind tunnel program to determine control effectiveness of separate surfaces in the presence of main surfaces, and hinge moment feedback from separate surfaces via the main surfaces to the pilot; second, a theoretical study to determine the minimum performance of actuators and sensors than can be tolerated, the best slaving gains to be used with separate surfaces, and control authority needed for proper operation under direct pilot control, under autopilot control, and in failure situations. On the basis of the results obtained, it has been concluded that separate surface systems are feasible and advantageous for use in general aviation aircraft. 1973 SA E Transactions 730305. Automated Prediction of Light Aircraft Per- formance and Riding and Handling Qualities. Frederick O. Smetana, Delbert C. Summey and W. Donald Johnson, North Carolina State University. The process leading to the development of efficient computer programs for predicting the performance and riding and handling qualities of light aircraft is described. The riding and handling qualities program permits one to specify only the aircraft geometry and to obtain as output the motion that geometry will produce in response to one of five specific control surface deflections. The per- formance programs fit both power available and drag data with high-order polynomials for accuracy. Conventional, static performance and integrations of the nonlinear 123</page><page sequence="47">730306-730312 equations of motion (so-colled path performance) are then obtained. Present efforts are directed toward comput- erizing the prediction of lift and drag given the aircraft geometry, so that by specifying the geometry one can immediately determine both the performance and the riding and handling qualities. 730306. General Aviation Landing Research at Princeton University. David R. Ellis, Princeton University. An in-flight simulator especially configured for landing research has been developed by Princeton University under NASA sponsorship. A thrust and drag control system utilizing a reversing propeller is incorporated, along with up-and-down deflecting flaps for lift modu- lation. Special consideration was given to safety features, including redundancy in some control channels. The flight work accomplished during the past year featured a generalized investigation of the effects of lift and drag response to pitch and throttle controls for several approach conditions. Experiments in progress are ex- ploring the effects of speed, ground proximity, and utility of direct lift controls. 730307. Use of Honeycomb and Bonded Structures in Light Aircraft. Andrew C. Marshall and Jay Brentjes, Hexcel Corp. Bonded structures, such as honeycomb sandwich, are becoming an important construction technique in the light aircraft industry. Designers can now select from a vast array of material to meet almost any design criteria. Some guidelines in material selection, tooling and fabrication methods, and the economics of sandwich construction are presented to aid persons responsible for each of those areas. 730308. Stepped Aluminum Extrusions - Designing for Business Aircraft. E. C. Sundberg, Kaiser Alu- minum &amp; Chemical Corp. Stepped extrusions, proven to provide considerable savings and versatile properties in military and commer- cial airframe structures, can provide similar benefits in the load-carrying structures of business aircraft. Successful application of stepped-extrusions depends upon utilizing established design criteria for the different sections, developing engineering properties to meet the load/in-service requirements, and obtaining the potential cost savings in the finishing operations. Business, military, or commercial airport, the stepped-extrusion design has the same to offer: product cost savings, versatility, and performance. A stepped- extrusion puts the metal where it is needed minimizing machining, wasting material, and providing optimum versatility in a single extrusion that has different cross- sections. Advantages of stepped-extrusions proven in aircraft such as the DC-9, DC- 10, 727, T37, A-4 have been successfully applied to the business aircraft. Stepped- extrusions developed for Cessna Citation wing spars show that application in business aircraft is profitable for tapering sections or assembles where the connecting end is three or four times larger than the longer section. 1973 SA E Transactions 730309. Fastening Analysis to Optimized Design. William H. Trembley, Voi Shan Div., VSI Corp. The material presented provides a basis for design analysis regarding the cost and functional impact of fastener selection. Certain specific requirements for fasteners identified for severe dynamic environments, as encoun- tered in high performance aircraft, are presented in simplified form as statements of results of empiricism. The economics of fastener selection are treated in the context of catalogue items versus specials, and the elements of installed cost versus material cost. 1973 SA E Transactions 730310. Development of a Lower Cost Radome. Jamie Peck, Cessna Aircraft Co. By use of new materials and processes, a new randome was developed which was less costly, more rigid, and lighter in weight than previous models. This was accom- plished by in-plant fabrication, autoclave cure, and use of thin honeycomb core. In describing the development of the new randome, the author presents design objectives, evaluates various material possibilities, and explains the selection of materials in the final structure. Treatment of the outside surface of the randome is also described. Finally, the fabrication process is discussed in detail. 730311. Filiform Corrosion Associated with Commonly Applied Aircraft Metal Pretreatments and Fin- ishes. Mike Gann, Cessna Aircraft Co. The filiform corrosion problems encountered on aircraft structures in geographical areas experiencing constant warm temperature and elevated relative humidity indicate that finishing systems evaluations consisting of standard salt spray exposure do not adequately relate the efficiency of a system in inhibiting corrosion. An alternate method of testing is proposed: simulating the actual service environment with production of filiform corrosion on aluminum and steel alloys which have been pretreated and finished with commonly applied aircraft finishes. A comparison between salt spray exposure and this simu- lated service environment with coating and pretreatment evaluations is described. 730312. Economic and Design Advantages of Aluminum Precision Forgings. W. H. Dunlap, Aluminum Co. of America. Aluminum precision forgings previously considered eco- nomically justified only in high production are today finding greater application at lower production require- ments. Improvement in forging die design, the use of segmented dies, and the ability to machine die cavities with EDM are some of the reasons. Value analysis has shown that some precision forgings are economically 124</page><page sequence="48">justified for production as low as 125-150 pieces. The more expensive the machining operations required to produce the part versus producing these details in the forging from accurate forging dies, the more advantageous the precision forging becomes. Precision forging toler- ances plus the absence of draft has brought the weight of the forging within range of the machined part. Forgings ready for assembly as received or requiring only fastener holes, anodizing, and painting, have reduced or eliminated double handling, machining operations, fixtures, and machining scrap. 730313. VLF Radio Navigation. James A. Wilson, Air- borne Navigation Corp. A tutorial introduction to current status and historical background of very low-frequency (VLF) radio navigation systems is presented. Included are VLF radio propagation characteristics and a discussion of alternate system philosophies. Features and performance of currently available systems are compared to illustrate the state- of-the-art. 730315. The Discrete Address Beacon System in the Air Traffic Control Environment. Martin T. Pozesky and Russell L. Biermann, Federal Aviation Administration. Many problems exist in meeting the future surveillance and communication needs of air traffic control. Many functions and services are now being developed for eventual implementation beginning after 1977. The op- eration, role, and impact of the Discrete Address Beacon System in meeting these needs and functions are discussed in this paper. 730316. Weathervision Memory Radar System. Richard W. Thwing, Sr., Bendix Avionics Div., Bendix Corp. A new concept in commercial airborne weather radars was developed for the turbo and pure jet-powered general-aviation aircraft. This radar presents a steady, nonfading weather or ground picture, without using the conventional direct-view storage tube, by utilizing digital processing techniques. Careful treatment of the radar design parameters allows 200 n. mile range operation while only requiring a few amperes of 28 V d-c from the aircraft power bus. These techniques are being applied to a family of radar systems. 730317. NASA in General Aviation Research - Past- Present-Future. Roger L. Winblade, National Aeronautics and Space Admin. The history of aeronautical research efforts within NACA/NASA is briefly traced to identify the foundation for the current NASA general aviation technology programs. Future program trends are discussed in general terms emphasizing relevance to the industry requirements. An appendix summarizes the research reports that have been generated under the current program. 730313-730320 730318. Applications of Advanced Aerodynamic Technol- ogy to Light Aircraft. Harold L. Crane and Robert J. McGhee, Langley Research Center, NASA; and David L. Kohlman, University of Kansas. This paper discusses a project for adapting advanced technology, much of it borrowed from the jet transport, to general aviation design practices. The NASA-funded portion of the work began in 1969 at the University of Kansas and resulted in a smaller, experimental wing with spoilers and powerful flap systems for a Cessna Cardinal airplane. The objective was to obtain increased cruise performance and improved ride quality while maintaining the take-off and landing speeds of the unmodified airplane. Some flight data and research pilot comments are presented. The project was expanded in 1972 to include a light twin-engine airplane. For the twin there was the added incentive of a potential increase in single-engine climb performance. The expanded project is a joint effort involving the University of Kansas, Piper Aircraft Co., Robertson Aircraft Co., and Wichita State University. The use of a new high-lift Whitcomb airfoil is planned for both the wing and the propellers. Preliminary data on the characteristics of the new airfoil are discussed. The configuration of an experimental wing for a Piper Seneca PA-34 and estimated airplane performance with this wing are discussed. 730319. Development of Airframe Design Technology for Crashworthiness. E. T. Kruszewski and R. G. Thomson, NASA Langley Research Center. This paper describes the NASA portion of a joint FAA-NASA General Aviation Crashworthiness Program leading to the development of improved crashworthiness design technology. The objectives of the program are to develop analytical technology for predicting crashworthi- ness of structures, provide design improvements, and perform full-scale crash tests. The analytical techniques which are being developed both in-house and under contract are described and typical results from these analytical programs are shown. In addition, the full-scale testing facility and test program are discussed. 730320. Stall/Spin Studies Relating to Light General- Aviation Aircraft. James S. Bowman, Jr. and Sanger M. Burk, Jr., Langley Research Center, NASA. The present paper discusses the NASA Langley Research Center stall/spin research program to improve the design and evaluation techniques relative to stall/spin charac- teristics of general aviation aircraft. The program encom- passes model wind-tunnel tests, spin-tunnel and radio- control model tests, and full-scale airplane spin tests. Initital spin-tunnel results on models with several tail designs representative of light airplanes and several testing techniques are discussed. 125</page><page sequence="49">730321-730328 730321. Application of Advanced Control System and Display Technology to General Aviation. Marvin R. Barber, NASA Flight Research Center. This paper reviews NASA's progress in research directed toward providing the technology necessary for the application of advanced control systems and displays to general aviation aircraft and its plans for this effort in the future. Flight evaluations of such systems as wing levelers, fluidic autopilots, yaw dampers, and angle of attack displays have been made, and test conditions and major results of some of this work are reported. Potentially valuable systems evaluated thus far are an attitude command control system and a flight-director display. As presently configured, both are prohibitively expensive for use in general avaiation, however, and efforts are underway to apply technology to the goal of reducing their cost. Perhaps the most promising developing in this area is called separate-surface stability augmentation, and plans for its implementation and flight testing are described. 730323. Shrouded Fan Propulsore for Light Aircraft. M. H. Waters and T. L. Galloway, Advanced Concepts and Missions Div., NASA; C. Rohr- bach and M. G. Mayo, Hamilton Standard Div., United Aircraft Corp. Continued growth of general-aviation over the next 10-15 years is dependent upon continuing improvement in aircraft safety, utility, performance, and cost. Moreover, these advanced aircraft will need to conform to expected government regulations controlling propulsion system emissions and noise levels. An attractive, compact, low-noise propulsor concept, the Q-FAN, when matched to reciprocating or rotary combustion engines, opens up the exciting prospect of new, cleaner airframe designs for the next generation of general-aviation aircraft, which will provide these improvements and meet the expected noise and pollution restrictions of the 1980 time period. In this paper, Q-FAN propulsion system performance, weight, noise, and cost trends are discussed. The impact of this propulsion system on the complete aircraft is investigated for two representative aircraft size categories. Examples of conceptual designs for Q-FAN/engine integration and aircraft installations are presented. 730324. Turbofan Propulsion for General-Aviation Air- planes. G. L. Merrill, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. of Arizona, Div., The Garrett Corp. This paper reports the results of a study, sponsored by the NAS A- Ames Advanced Concepts and Missions Division, of the applicability of small turbofan engines to general- aviation airplanes. Because of its high overall propulsion system effi- ciency, the turbofan engine is now being chosen for most military and commercial airplanes. To evaluate the turbofan's further applicability to smaller general-aviation airplanes, NASA-Ames and AiResearch have performed a study to establish engine and engine/airplane perform- ance, weight, size, and cost interrelationships, and to evaluate the effects of specific engine noise constraints. The methods whereby these interrelationships and effects were determined, and the results of synthesis and sensitivity analyses are described. In addition to engine cost, engine performance quality was found to be a very important determinant of airplane size and resultant price and operating cost. 1973 SA E Transactions 730325. The Development of Reciprocating Engine In- stallation Data for General Aviation Aircraft. Frank Monts, AVCO Corp. The need for adequate reciprocating engine installation data is discussed. Techniques for obtaining reliable installation data and methods for their application to assure efficient, minimum drag installation design is presented. Aircraft performance gains to be expected from improved engine cooling characteristics is included. The testing was performed on a Lycoming TIGO- 541 -GÌ AD, a 6-cyl, horizontally opposed, aftercooled engine rated at 450 bhp with operational capability beyond 30,000 ft. 730326. Electroforming. J. F. Schiess, Ringler-Dorin, Inc. Electroforming produces close tolerance and nonporous tools, and offers savings in time and investment in capital equipment. Tools made by electroforming are not as limited as tools of high-temperature plastic construction which, because of repeated heat cycling, have reduced accuracy after long use. Tools fabricated from aluminum stock can be economically produced only if the shape, contours, and curves can be achieved by rolling, braking, or welding the aluminum stock. Hand finishing operations are expensive and time-consuming. 730328. Some Aspects of STOL Aircraft Aerodynamics. John L. Loth, West Virginia University. STOL aircraft obtain their unique performance by incorporating in their design any one or all of three design aspects: increase of the powerplant size to minimize the weight-to-thrust ratio, increase of the wing area to reduce the wing loading, and/or increase of the maximum obtainable lift coefficient. A special powered STOL light aircraft wing has been developed at West Virginia University. This wing com- bines several STOL features such as: circulation control through blowing around a circular trailing edge, boundary layer control through suction, leading edge modification and slats, 20% increase in chord length in the STOL mode, blown and drooped ailerons, and fences for maximum spanwise lift distribution. This wing was designed at West Virginia University and is based on the results of theoretical analysis and wind tunnel tests of several other configuration. The wing has been built and is to be test flown in spring 1973 on a light aircraft called the Technology Demonstrator. The 126</page><page sequence="50">wing design features and anticipated performance are described. 730330. Feasibility and Optimization of Variable-Geom- etry Wing for Jet Amphibian Business Aircraft. Donald J. Ritchie, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Univ. A design analysis is carried out to compare the per- formance of a telescoping wing airplane with a fixed-wing type. The increase in wing weight required by the telescoping wing is taken into account. Marked im- provement in range performance is obtained with the telescoping wing. Optimum design values of cruise velocity are obtained for each landing speed. A preliminary design of an 8-place turbofan amphib- ian aircraft is carried out to show the relation of component weights to a fixed-wing design. Performance of the example aircraft is marginal. 730331. Development of a Low-Cost Flight Director System for General Aviation. Shu W. Gee, Flight Research Center, NASA; and N. A. Servais, Astronautics Corp. of America. The NASA Flight Research Center awarded a contract to Astronautics Corp. of America to develop a low-cost flight director system for general aviation. The system that was designed is expected to cost the consumer less than $3000 - a reduction of nearly 70% in the total cost of available systems. The features that permit lower cost without excessive degradation in performance are: use of belt drives, a high-volume-production standards parts, single-box construction including gyros, and post-plate construction techniques. 730332. Computer Aided Parametric Analysis for General Aviation Aircraft. Thomas L. Galloway and Mark H. Waters, Advanced Concepts and Missions Div., NASA. The development of a computer model designed to aid in the preliminary design analysis of general aviation aircraft is described. This model has interrelated in computerized form, the technical disciplines of configuration design, aerodynamics, propulsion, structural weight and balance, and economics to provide a useful engineering tool for identifying critical design parameters and promising advanced technologies. Both analysis of a given airplane and the design of an airplane to meet specified criteria can be achieved with various levels of input and synthesis complexity. Results of a typical parametric analysis are presented for a turbine-powered, six-place configuration. 730333. A Stall/Spin Prevention Device for General- Aviation Aircraft. Howard Chevalier and Joseph C. Brusse, Texas A&amp;M University. Stall/spin airplane accidents result in a significant number of fatalities each year within the general-aviation com- munity. The most effective method of reducing this type of accident is to prevent airplane stalls. The device 730330-730338 described in this report has been shown to be effective in preventing stall of a Piper PA- 18, 150 airplane, and it should also be effective on other airplanes. The system incorporates a small spoiler mounted on the under surface of the stabilizer near the elevator hinge line. The spoiler is deployed automatically by means of a servo system that receives its commands from an angle of attack sensor mounting in the wing leading edge. Thus, the operation of the system is independent of pilot reactions. The spoiler deploys to limit tail power near the wing stall angle of attack, thereby preventing the wing from reaching the angle of attack required for stalling. Flight tests have shown the device to be effective in all normal flight conditions by preventing the airplane from stalling. In addition, the stall prevention system increases stick force after deployment at high wing angle of attack. 1973 SA E Transactions 730334. General Aviation Pilot Operations. G. S. Weis- logel, The Ohio State University. The general aviation pilot outnumbers his airline coun- terpart 30: 1 and flies five times an many hours each year. General aviation, defined as all civil flying activity except that performed by the public air carriers, is a hetero- geneous population of airmen including the weekend pilot flying a "Cub" to the versatile corporate pilot flying a $3 million corporate jet. Until recently little has been known about the operational profiles of the different categories of general aviation pilots, resulting in judgments about their oper- ations which are a priori at best. Under the direction of the Federal Aviation Administration Systems Research and Development Service, studies have been conducted which yield for the first time quantitative measures useful in describing the nature of certain categories of general aviation pilots and their flight operations. Study findings are expected to have implications for airman certification standards, flight safety regulations, and aircraft design. Rather than a report of a specific research study, this paper can be considered a ready reference in that it presents a broad review and summary of several studies which have developed information about general aviation pilot operations. 730337. Fatigue and Fracture of Advanced Composite Materials. B. E. Kaminski, General Dynamics Corp. This paper presents a brief review of some of the contributing factors in design for fatigue and fracture of advanced composite materials. Consideration is given to the roles which the fiber and matrix have in the static, fatigue, and fracture response of laminated composites. The statistical aspects of failure are also discussed. 730338. Structural Cost Effectiveness of Composites. Charles W. Bert and Karl H. Bergey, The University of Oklahoma. This paper describes a rational basis for making tradeoff 127</page><page sequence="51">730339-730347 decisions on cost and weight for structures made of various materials. Unit cost and empty weight data have been gathered for a variety of consumer products and of aircraft. As examples illustrating potential applications of filamentary composites, the cost/weight tradeoff ratios were calculated for three typical aircraft structural components: a landing-gear cantilever-spring strut, an I-beam, and a shear panel. In addition, weight analyses of fuselage structures were made for designs using a variety of materials and these structural concepts: monocoque, sandwich, and ring-and-stringer-stiffened cylinders. With the cost reductions anticipated in the next three or four years for graphite and boron filamentary composites, fiber composites hold considerable promise for general-aviation aircraft. 730339. Composities for Noise Control. Narayanan Ganesan, Gates Learjet Corp. A survey of the use of composite structures for noise control, particularly in an aircraft cabin, is presented in this paper. The various sources of the noise entering the cabin and the measures to deal with them are considered. Guidelines for optimum distribution of masses in the skin, septum and trim panel, and for choosing thickness of insulation materials and airspaces are presented. 730340. A Comparison of Structural Test Results with Predictions of Finite Element Analysis. Robert O'Donnell, Gates Learjet Corp. This paper presents the results of two static tests of structures in use on certificated aircraft and a description of finite element models of these structures. Comparisons of the results of the static tests and the predictions of the finite element and analyses are given. Problems encoun- tered in the development of the finite element models are presented, and solutions to these problems are discussed. Implementation, application, and functional aspects of finite element analysis are also discussed. This paper does not cover the basic mathematical development of finite analysis, nor dynamic analysis applications. 730341. Inexpensive, Full-Scale Aircraft Fatigue Test System. John H. Simmons, Piper Aircraft Corp. The investigation of an inexpensive, full-scale, two- channel fatigue test apparatus for light airplanes is described. The rationale and assumptions made that aided in the development are detailed, and the total system and operating costs are presented. This program demonstrated that such a system is practical as well as cost effective. 730344. Improved Failure Detection Techniques Based on Spectrometric Oil Analysis Data. O. O. Bendik- sen, Pacific Airmotive Corp. This paper discusses a set of general analysis techniques which have been developed to improve the capability of spectrometric oil analysis to detect failures of oil-wetted components in turbojet engines. Present knowledge of the failure processes involved is used to estimate the prop- erties of the colloidal suspension of the wear particles in the oil and to show how these properties affect the spectrometric concentration readings obtained. Many of the anomalies occasionally observed in the spectrometric data are explained in terms of the effects of the random distribution of the wear debris throughout the oil and the size distribution of the individual wear particles. Com- bining these results, it is shown that the rate of wear metal liberation is a better indication of the mechanical condition of a component than is the absolute concen- tration of wear metal in the oil. The method is made operationally effective through the use of a general purpose digital computer to perform time-consuming tasks such as calculation of wear metal liberation rates, correction for oil consumption effects, and quantitative correlation analysis for diagnostic purposes. 1973 SA E Transactions 730345. Engine Cycle Considerations for Future Trans- port Aircraft. Robert P. Gerend, John P. Round- hill and Albertus D. Welliver, The Boeing Co. Recent noise technology advancements have provided an increased understanding of true engine noise "floor" levels. This has led to changes in necessary engine cycle requirements for low-noise commercial airplanes. Updat- ed prediction techniques for the core and jet noise sources are described, and lining technology improvements are reviewed. The need for futher work in the core noise area is emphasized. The impact of these noise technology revisions on the best engine cycle for obtaining low noise is presented. It is concluded that engines with lower bypass ratios than previously anticipated may be ac- ceptable. 1973 SA E Transactions 730346. Refanned Commercial Gas Turbine Engines. G. M. McRae, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. A NASA sponsored program to develop noise-reduction modifications for the JT3D and JT8D engines was initiated in August 1972. New higher flow single-stage fans are attractive and result in higher bypass ratios with improved thrust and fuel consumption and reduced jet velocities. Fly-over noise reductions as great as 20 EPNdB are shown for the modified engines with nacelle treatment. Engine certification can be completed and production hardware for fleet retrofit or new airplanes can be provided by late 1975. 1973 SA E Transactions 730347. Profitable Transport Engines for the Environment of the Eighties. Norman Epstein and Bruce J. Gordon, Aircraft Engine Group, General Elec- tric Co. This paper assesses the impact of meeting the environ- mental requirements for reduced noise and air pollution on the cost and technical design considerations for engines to power the next generation of commercial 128</page><page sequence="52">transport aircraft. Engine candidates studied are in the advanced (new) design class as well as derivatives of existing high bypass turbofan engines which offer attrac- tive total cost of ownership features. The elements of operating cost are analyzed for the effect of the engine on aircraft economics, with special attention to operating cost differences between new engines and those derived from current in-service high bypass engines. 1973 SA E Transactions 730348. B-l Technology Applications to Advanced Trans- port Design. Edward O. Schnakenburg, Rock- well International. Several unique design approaches have been used to configure the B-l strategic bomber. These innovations are applicable to future advanced supersonic transport (AST) design approaches. The combined aerodynamic/structural efficiency of the B-l is enhanced by using the blended wing/body concept. Structural mode control has been incorporated to alleviate structural motion, because the B-l will be involved in considerable low-altitude, high-turbulence flying. Application of this system should be considered for the AST to reduce the structural penalties inherent at the high-speed portion of the flight envelope. The B-l is the first airplane to be designed to a specified fracture mechanics requirement. Future transport designs, in- cluding future ASTs, probably will have a similar requirement to augment the present fatigue criteria. Several B-l subsystem advancements applicable to the AST program scope are discussed. In particular, the B-l 's flight control systems incorporate many unique features to enhance its safety, mission success, and survivability/ vulnerability characteristics. Command augmentation is used in all control axes, providing undegraded fail- operational, fail-safe capability. Mechanical component protection from jams and disconnects is provided, along with rotary surface actuators in certain advantageous locations. A combination of fly-by-wire control of certain surfaces to a dual fly-by-wire/mechanical control of other surfaces provides a high probability of mission completion in any environment. All primary control surfaces are designed to operate after any two hydraulic failures. Extensive use of diffusion bonding is being employed in constructing the major structural components of the B-l. Complicated shapes can be easily molded into homo- geneous parts. Since the AST will have similar component requirements, the use of diffusion bonding should allow the designer much more latitude in obtaining efficient structural members. 1973 SA E Transactions 730349. Second-Generation SST. L. T. Goodmanson and B. Williams, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. The paper discusses the design objectives and a devel- opment cycle for a second-generation supersonic trans- port. The environmental impact of technological ad- vancement and the rapidly changing economic market 730348-730352 produce a wide divergence of possible programs for the 1985 time period. Areas of technological advancement that can move in the direction of the second-generation design objectives will be included. Some of these advances require development of methodology to be able to reduce the technical risk of application to a commercial SST and some require exploratory development. 1973 SA E Transactions 730350. The Concorde Manufacturing Consortium - An Exercise in International Engineering Collabo- ration. E. H. Burgess, British Aircraft Corp. This account of the development of the Concorde and its eventual manufacture is highlighted by the cooperative efforts of two dissimilar countries, brought together by a singular vision and united by a determination to create a practicable design of a mass-transport aircraft. The innumerable problems encountered cannot be completely covered in this capsule history, but the overall review given here presents a new approach toward solving the economic troubles of the air transportation industry, which may possibly be affected by impractical compet- itive practices. 730351. Introduction of Concorde. P. Besson, Air France. The introduction of the Concorde will cause major changes in airline and airport operation. The aircraft will have a higher speed, lower passenger capacity, and higher operation costs than subsonic jets. This paper discusses the effects of each of these upon airline and airport operation. Included in the discussion are scheduling, interior layout, on-board passenger service, baggage handling, passenger handling, maintenance schedules, pooling of spare parts service, crew training, and flight planning. 730352. Transport Cargo Aircraft Concepts. R. C. Horn- burg, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. Since the advent of jet freighter aircraft in the 1960s, a great deal of attention has been placed on the future of air freight and particularly on the aircraft that will carry it. Studies for the "ultimate" optimized air freighter have been many and varied. Concepts have generally been market oriented, aircraft oriented, or ground systems oriented. The base for these studies has been so broad that a set of requirements for a new generation of freighter aircraft and supporting ground systems has not been finalized and the development funds therefore have not been allocated. This paper discusses some of the possible aircraft and ground systems concepts that might satisfy the future market, the parametric and specific studies that led to these concepts, and the economic constraints that will have to be overcome if the true market potential of air freight is ever to be realized. 1973 SA E Transactions 129</page><page sequence="53">730353-730359 730353. Development of the A300B Wide-Body Twin. Arthur Howes, European Aerospace Corp. The A300B is a wide-body, twin-engined aircraft develop- ed jointly by leading aviation companies throughout Europe and the United States. It has been built for the major intra-European route structures and the short-haul route networks of North America. Engineering of the aircraft maximizes reliability and economy on the exact- ing short-range operations. The first A300B off the line flew on Oct. 28, 1972, just 3-V2 years after go-ahead, and by the end of 1972 had flown 98 h. During 1973, that first airplane will be joined in flight testing by three others, in a program leading to certification by the end of 1973. Initial deliveries to airlines will be made early in 1974. 730354. Key Factors in Developing a Future Wide-Bodied Twin-Jet Transport. John S. Clauss, Jr., Lock- heed-California Co. A successful short-haul transport must satisfy customer and marketplace requirements and be attractive econom- ically. This paper examines the marketplace in the late 1970 time period to determine the payload-range and other performance requirements for a wide-bodied twin- jet transport. Environmental and operating cost targets are established, and the size of the market is estimated. An "optimal" design is then described which essentially represents the best possible airplane using the technology available in the time period best suited to the customer and marketplace requirements. Design data are presented that show the sensitivities of the design to some of the primary configuration variables. Certain design compromises are considered that have to do with airframe commonality with other transports in the manufacturer's stable. The optimal design is then biased to increase the commonality with a parent airplane, thereby realizing manufacturing cost economies for reduced airline ownership costs but increasing engine and fuel costs. An interim baseline configuration is selected and more detailed studies made of its characteristics. 1973 SAE Transactions 730355. 747 Developments. Row Brown, The Boeing Co. Changes in air transport operating environment are examined to show how they are beginning to change the design and use of transport aircraft. The essential requirement of the changing market is seen to be a new flexibility to provide versatility in the quantity of normal on-demand seats provided in each market, suitability for high capacity seasonal bulk class operations, and suitability for expanding the cargo load capability on selected passenger flights. Airplane characteristics and advanced technology to satisfy the requirements of the new operating flexibility are discussed. 730356. Airtransit: The Canadian Demonstration Inter- urban STOL Service. Roy B. McCormack, Air Canada. Funds have been made available by the Canadian Government for a STOL demonstration program to last approximately two years starting in early 1974. It is to be the initial phase of a major national program to develop a complete STOL air transport system including aircraft, STOLports, navigation aids, air traffic control, regula- tions, operating procedures, and other supporting services. Using specially modified de Havilland Twin Otter aircraft, the commercial demonstration service will be operated by a subsidiary company of Air Canada between STOLports located near the urban centers of Montreal and Ottowa. 730357. STOL in Low Density Operations. Raymond A. Ausrotas, Massachusetts Institute of Technol- °gy. A discussion of air transportation in low-density areas is presented, with emphasis on STOL operations. Low- density market characteristics in the United States are described and aircraft suitable for these markets are compared. Some existing STOL operations are reviewed including the Norwegian STOL services in some detail. It is concluded that a STOL system is an attractive investment in the isolated, low-density areas of the world. 1973 SAE Transactions 730358. Thrust Reversers for Civil STOL Aircraft. R. H. Colley and J. M. D. Sutton, Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. (England). Assuming future STOL aircraft of 60 to 200 seats, 0.7 to 0.85 cruise Mach number, and landing at around 90 knots on runways down to 2000 ft in length, an examination is made of the need for reversers and what special require- ments and constraints will apply. It is concluded that reversers are very likely to be used, both in flight (for descent thrust control) and on the ground. This paper describes a fast-selection control system and several thrust reverser designs, aimed at high performance, low specific weight, compatibility with acoustic and other requirements, and suitability for high bypass engines. Thrust reversers and reversing fans are compared. 1973 SAE Transactions 730359. Integrated Propulsion Control System Program. Charles E. Bentz, Air Force Aero Propulsion Lab.; and John R. Zeller, NASA Lewis Re- search Center. Propulsion system hardware has steadily increased in complexity which has placed even greater demands on the propulsion control hardware. With the engine and inlet operating at higher levels of performance, the need for improvements in control system technology has become more evident. In addition to increased sensing and computation, it is required that the various inlet and engine control functions be integrated to achieve maxi- mum propulsion system stability and performance during all flight conditions. This paper describes a three year 130</page><page sequence="54">exploratory research program for the design, development and flight evaluation of an Integrated Propulsion Control System (IPCS). The primary objectives of this program are to establish through flight test the potential improvements in steady state and transient propulsion system per- formance that can be achieved as a direct result of new modes of control, more direct sensing of engine and inlet parameters and the use of more sophisticated, high-speed digital computation. A F-lll E aircraft with the left inlet and engine modified to the IPCS configuration will be used to conduct the flight evaluation. 1973 SA E Transactions 730360. Lift-Fan Propulsion/Control System. John C. Ford, Rockwell International Corp. Recent studies have been conducted by Rockwell Inter- national and Grumman Aerospace Corps, under contract to NASA Ames Research Center to modify a Grumman Gulfstream II aircraft to a lift-fan transport research aircraft. This paper describes the proposed vehicle and the propulsion/control system to be used for the vertical and transition modes of flight. Criteria for system performance and results of testing on the Ames 6 degrees-of-freedom simulator are de- scribed. Advances in lift-fan propulsion technology over the past 10 years are summarized, and typical operational lift-fan vehicles are illustrated. 1973 SA E Transactions 730362. Navy Development of Low-Cost Supersonic Tur- bojet Engines. Darrell W. Walker, Naval Weap- ons Center. This paper is a review of a Naval Air Systems Command program for exploratory development of a low-cost supersonic turbine engine. Design constraints, perform- ance requirements, estimated engine costs, and latest program results are presented. Briefly described, the engine is 14 in in diameter, 44 in in length, produces 2300 lb thrust at Mach 1.5, sea level, (approximately 1600 lb, sea level static), and is estimated to cost $7000-11,000 in production. 1973 SA E Transactions 730364. Turbine Powerplants for Missiles - Cost Im- provement Requirements. William E. Kidd, Tele- dyne CAE. Impacts of mission related requirements on design of the J402-CA-400 missile propulsion turbojet engine are reviewed. Small engine cost scaling rationale is presented in relation to engine thrust and functional requirements. The application of current casting technology towards achieving low cost is reviewed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730365. The Air Force/ Boeing Advanced Medium STOL Transport Prototype. James J. Foody, Boeing Aerospace Co. 730360-730374 The Boeing AMST prototype is a unique design aimed at meeting the goals set by the Air Force for the modern- ization of tactical airlift. The rationale for the major configuration decisions is reviewed in this paper. Meeting the production cost constraint, one of the most chal- lenging goals, demanded a new design approach aimed at part commonality, in addition to a simplified structural arrangement. The possibility of a commercial derivative of the AMST is reviewed and a proposal made for the use of a small AMST fleet to demonstrate the market potential and the feasibility of short field commercial operation. 1973 SA E Transactions 730366. Technical Basis for the STOL Characteristics of the McDonnell Douglas/USAF YC-15 Prototype Airplane. Marvin D. Marks, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. This paper presents the basic technology for making the McDonnell Douglas YC-15 the prototype of an effective military STOL airplane. Emphasis is placed on those technical elements essential to providing good perform- ance and flying qualities in the spectrum of STOL operational modes, while retaining good productivity for a matrix of off-design transport missions. The goal for the prototype is to demonstrate that the externally blown flap propulsive-lift airplane has STOL flying qualities, transport productivity, and design features well suited to the military tactical transport role. Emphasis on STOL technology to provide excellent control characteristics, low pilot workload, and generally good low-speed flying qualities, while paying careful attention to operational considerations for configuration development, is probably as important to the acceptability of the AMST as the more narrow look at maximizing payload/radius performance. 730373. Air Force Propulsion Maintenance Concepts. A. Bruce Richter and Leo Matkins, U.S. Air Force Logistics Command. The Air Force and the airlines have generally followed different aircraft engine maintenance concepts. This paper identifies some of the engine maintenance practices the Air Force has used in the past and how these practices are being improved to obtain engine on-condition mainte- nance. Reviews of the Air Force Spectrometric Oil Analysis Program (SOAP), Nondestructive Inspection (NDI) Program, and engine diagnostics efforts are presented. 730374. The Development of a Turbine Engine Main- tenance Program from a New Reliability Model. Thomas M. Edwards, Jr. and Hu Lew, Jr., United Air Lines, Inc. In the last 12 years new conclusions have been reached concerning the traditional reliability model for turbine aircraft engines. The overhaul of engines at one point in time has been discarded. New maintenance processes called "On Condition" and "Condition Monitoring" have 131</page><page sequence="55">730375-730380 been defined. A simple decision diagram has been devised to determine the proper maintenance process for each part. The historical background for these new conclusions, the maintenance decision diagram, and a new mainte- nance program called Powerplant LIBRA are discussed in this paper. 1973 SA E Transactions 730375. Review of Engine Maintenance Concepts Applied to Wide Body Jets. James F. Rudolph, Federal Aviation Administration. In the early design stages of the advanced technology high-bypass-ratio engines, it became evident that main- tainability considerations and more effective maintenance concepts would be necessary to achieve higher reliability and more economically successful powerplants. This paper reviews the major design considerations from a maintainability standpoint. It describes the concepts developed specifically to provide more effective main- tenance for the wide-body jets. It discusses the effec- tiveness of these programs, and provides an insight into new philosophies and trends envisioned by the Federal Aviation Administration for future maintenance man- agement programs. 1973 SA E Transactions 730376. Fundamental Aspects of Noise Reduction from Powered-Lift Devices. Richard E. Hayden, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. Proposed powered-lift STOL aircraft are expected to require noise reductions on the order of 20 dB to meet community noise goals, according to a number of model and full-scale studies. Powered-lift STOL introduces to the designer a new class of noise problems in that the noise sources are exposed and not amenable to conven- tional muffling. Thus, the noise must be reduced at the source, a task for which thorough understanding of source mechanisms is required. A review of source mechanisms associated with various powered-lift concepts is presented and current state-of-the-art of prediction technology is assessed for each important source. Sources are rank-ordered for the various classes of lift-augmenting concepts. Parametric dependence of source levels on design and operating parameters is discussed. Fundamental concepts for noise reduction are developed and current progress toward implementation of these noise reduction concepts is reviewed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730377. Status of Current Development Activity Related to STOL Propulsion Noise Reduction. R. J. Rulis, Lewis Research Center, NASA. The noise goal of 95 PNdB for STOL aircraft imposes severe technology demands on propulsion systems. Effects of this goal on the design of the propulsion system are reviewed. Results from recent development programs associated with STOL noise reduction, such as high bypass fan tests, 25 PNdB acoustic suppression test, sonic inlets, and powered lift system noise tests, are presented. Integrated propulsion system designs for the blown flap and augmentor wing powered lift systems capable of meeting the noise goal are shown and the performance, installation, and economic penalties assessed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730378. Design Studies of Low-Noise Propulsive-Lift Airplanes. H. S. Sweet, H. R. Leslie and J. A. Bennett, Lockheed-Georgia Co. A review is presented of low-noise airplanes designed for operation in the 1980 time period. Aircraft with paramet- ric engines covering a range of fan-pressure ratios and noise levels were developed conceptually under contract with NASA Advanced Concepts and Missions Division, supported by the NASA Lewis Research Center contracts for the Quiet Clean STOL Experimental Engine (QCSEE) Study Program. Powered-lift concepts included externally blown flap, augmentor wing, internally blown flap, and over-the-wing upper surface blowing. Performance, sizing, and costs are described for 148 passenger airplanes with design field length varying from 2000-4000 ft. Techniques for reducing noise are evaluated in terms of aircraft performance, weight, and cost; experimental data on decayer nozzles are presented and assessed with respect to effectiveness in exhaust noise reduction and aircraft performance penalties. Noise footprints for aircraft with different lift concepts and different field length capabilities are discussed from the standpoint of community acceptance of STOL short-haul service at existing carrier airports, general aviation airports, or dedicated new STOLports. Recommendations are made for further work in development or rational criteria for short-haul noise levels and for areas that hold promise of further noise reduction. 1973 SA E Transactions 730379. An Airline View of the Future of Auxiliary Power Systems. James E. McMillen, Eastern Air Lines, Inc. In an effort to relieve some of the environmental and economic pressures placed upon operation of commercial air transport equipment, several future aircraft designs have been discussed which consider in-flight use of the auxiliary power unit (APU). Justification for such a system is logical considering the depth of analysis conducted to date. But is must be remembered that it is the ultimate consumer, the traveling public, who must be satisfied. There can be no compromise on safety and reliability. Future studies of in-flight use of the APU must take this into account. 730380. Advanced Aircraft Power Systems Utilizing Coupled APU/ECS. G. J. Amarei and J. G. Castor, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. of Ari- zona, Div. of The Garrett Corp. This paper is presented to show that excess power from 132</page><page sequence="56">the environmental control system (ECS) can be used to supplement the power input requirement of the accessory drive gearbox on an advanced strike bomber aircraft. The feasibility of connecting the expansion turbine of the conventional system to the gearbox is discussed. Two methods of attaining a coupled ECS are compared with the conventional system relative to weight, volume, and takeoff gross weight. From evidence presented, the conclusion was that a coupled simple-cycle system would be the most advantageous. 1973 SA E Transactions 730381. The Role of the Auxiliary Power Unit in Future Airplane Secondary Power Systems. K. T. Tane- mura and B. C. Hainline, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. Use of primary propulsion engines to supply secondary power for future airplane systems will incur increasing penalties due to technological and ecological consider- ations. This paper compares the relative merits of four secondary power system (SPS) concepts most likely to mature in the 1975-1985 time period. It also indicates that a promising payoff is available by the use of a dedicated auxiliary power unit (APU) SPS concept (in-flight APUs) for future near-sonic, long-range transports. Improve- ments to current technology APUs will be required before the APU can be further integrated in the SPS and can be depended upon for in-flight system power. 1973 SA E Transactions 730384.

The AIRTRANS system now under construction at the new Dallas/Fort Worth Airport is truly a complete intra-airport transportation system. It is designed to carry passengers and employees (in separate cars), transport all interline baggage and mail, remove all trash from the terminals to a central dump, and deliver commissary supplies from a common warehouse to the terminals. It is a fully automatic system with guarantees on trip times and mechanical performance. The system contains some 13 miles of guideway within the airport, 68 vehicles plus service vehicles, and a central control point to provide surveillance over the automatic operation. Au- tomatic container handling equipment is also included in the airlines operations area to ease the task of the airlines. The system has been under design and fabrication since spring 1971. Two years later, most of the vehicles will be fabricated, a high percentage of the guideway and mechanical equipment will be installed, and the system will be undergoing extensive checkout and testing. 730385. JFTOT - A New Fuel Thermal Stability Test. J. A. Bert and L. J. Painter, Chevron Research Co. Comparisons are made between the Jet Fuel Thermal Oxidation Test (JFTOT) and the ASTM-CRC Coker Test (D 1660), which could be replaced with this new laboratory test device. The JFTOT represents another 730381-730388 method for rating the deposit-forming tendencies of fuels. It utilizes the same principle as the ASTM CRC Coker with certain improvements and is expected to be com- parable to the Coker in ranking fuels. The JFTOT has the following operating advantages over the Coker: smaller sample size, shorter test time, easier operation, better tube temperature control, higher temperature capability, and higher fuel system pressure to minimize two-phase flow. The precision of determining maximum deposits is about the same with both tests. Precision of measuring test filter pressuré drop in the JFTOT is significantly better than the Coker. Precision of measuring "breakpoint" temperature in the JFTOT is significantly better than the Coker. The JFTOT operated at a heater tube control temperature of 470°F (243°C) should provide the same pass-fail criteria as the Coker operated at a fuel out control temperature of 300°F (149°C). A light-reflectance method for rating tube deposits was found to be more precise than the visual method used with the Coker. Although there is a general relationship between the two rating methods, they are not exactly interchangeable. 1973 SA E Transactions 730386. The DC-10 Fuel System. A. T. Peacock, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. The DC-10 fuel system is described with details given for the various subsystems. Reasoning is given for some design features of the several subsystems. System per- formance capabilities are discussed, including refuel rates and times for various nozzle configurations and fuel supply pressures, defuel capability using pressure and suction methods, pump sizes, and jettison rates. System refinements made since introduction of the DC-10 into commercial service are described. Service experience with the fuel system is discussed. 730387. Airline Fuel Handling Standards. J. K. Siddons, American Airlines, Inc. Three airlines - AA, TW, and UA - have combined talents and experience to agree on 10 fuel-handling standardization documents. These documents provide detailed specifications and procedures for turbine fuel, safety, quality control, aircraft servicing, refuelers, hy- drant vehicles, equipment performance tests, storage facilities, and hydrant systems. This paper reviews the fuel-handling standards pro- gram and highlights each document. The documents, while providing complete coverage, are presented as the groundwork for universal fuel-handling standards. 730388. A Simplified Fuel Control Approach for Low-Cost Aircraft Gas Turbines. Harold Gold, Lewis Research Center, NASA. Cost reduction in aircraft turbine engines may be obtained through performance reductions that are ac- ceptable for ranges that are considerably shorter than the 133</page><page sequence="57">730411-730417 range for which current and costly engines were develop- ed. Cost reduction in the fuel control for these cost engines must be achieved without significant performance reduction. This paper describes a fuel control approach that appears to meet this requirement and reviews the work that has been performed on it over the past few years. 1973 SA E Transactions 730411. Design for Graphics. William J. Bowman, Stan- ford University. This paper consists of viewing graphics as a language showing it is critical to effective visual communication. Equally important is the process of visual translation itself, the practical application of graphic language to expressive requirements. This paper identifies in logical order some of the major message functions of graphic language, and to develop these functions in terms of specific communicative options available to the designer. 1973 SA E Transactions 730412. Laboratory Power Train Testing Using Field Recorded Loads. Paul D. Clark and Darrold E. Roen, John Deere Dubuque Tractor Works. A system has been developed to load the power train of a lab test vehicle with field recorded torques. This loading is accomplished with hydraulically activated axle load brakes which are controlled by an electro-hydraulic servo system. The entire power train is then tested as though the tractor was operating in the field. The advantages of the test system include 24h/day operation regardless of weather conditions and very consistent day to day loading of the test vehicle. This paper presents the reasons for starting the program and a description of the power train test system. 730413. (P-49) Biomechanics and Its Application to Automotive Design. Richard G. Snyder, The University of Michigan; Voigt R. Hodgson, Wayne State Univ., Alan M. Nahum, University of California, Los Angeles; A. I. King, Wayne State Univ., A. H. Burstein, Case Western Reserve Univ., Raymond R. McHenry, Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc., Lawrence M. Patrick, Alexander J. Walt, Robert F. Wilson and William A. Lange, Wayne State Univ.; and Harold J. Mertz, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. A collection of the lecture notes, in 3-ring binder form, that were the basis of a special seminar given at the 1973 International Automotive Engineering Congress &amp; Ex- position. An outstanding interdisciplinary medical, bio- mechanical and engineering faculty was chosen to give the following lectures: Techniques for Establishing Tolerance to Impact-Head Injury - Neck Injury - Facial Injury - Thoracic Injury - Abdominal Injury - Spine and Pelvis - Limbs - Vehicle Collision Environment - Summary of Human Tolerance Data and Its Application to Vehicle Design. 730414. Air and Noise Considerations in Highway Design and Construction Process. David S. Gedney, Federal Highway Administration. Highway design and construction processes can and do have significant impact on a community and its envi- ronment. Geometric design innovations can significantly reduce air and noise pollution for a completed facility, but construction noise is especially difficult to control within tolerable limits unless engineers and equipment manu- facturers seek better methods through investment in additional cost and improved technology. 730415. Acquisition and Utilization of Construction Ma- chinery Product Service Data. L. J. Mattson, Allis-Chalmers Corp. After-sales product information remains one of the most vital and elusive inputs required by a profitable manu- facturer. Tracking of capital goods products, such as construction machinery, is especially critical because of its high product-unit value, extended product service life, and the market demand for continued product improvement. This paper presents a system designed by a manufacturer to accumulate, assimilate, and disseminate timely product service information. 730416. What the Construction Equipment User Expects from the Manufacturer and Dealer. F. J. Larkin, Dravo Corp. This paper discusses the relationship between users of construction equipment and the manufacturers and dealers of the equipment. The people involved in this relationship are the deciding factors in whether all participants are satisfied, as the people are responsible ultimately for the product. The paper points out that the major qualities necessary in the considerations behind a user's satisfaction with a manufacturer's product are those belonging to people: ingenuity, improvement, and integ- rity. Examples are shown from the user's point of view of the need for these qualities, of which integrity is the most important. 730417. Stell Castings as Engineered Components. R. W. Zillmann, Steel Founders' Society of America. This paper discusses the principles involved in the design of steel castings, the characteristics of which are advan- tageous from both an engineering and an economic point of view. The responsibility for quality, soundness, strength, and serviceability rests not in the foundry but with the designer. Most designers, however, have little experience with casting design. The basic design rules, which are based upon the laws of chemistry and physics, are thus presented as well as a description of testing techniques, various properties, and behavior under spe- cific service conditions. It is through the close cooperation 134</page><page sequence="58">of the knowledgeable designer with the foundryman that ultimately the optimum design results. 1973 SA E Transactions 730418. Ductile Iron Castings - Current Capabilities. Harvey E. Henderson, Lynchburg Foundry Co. This paper describes ductile iron castings used in the earthmoving industry. Ductile iron is a cast ferrous alloy with carbon (in the form of graphite) and magnesium in its iron base. The graphite form can be evaluated by ASTM A-247. Ductile iron has many of the properties of gray iron, cast-iron, and steel, but it has certain excellent properties of its own. It is strong, elastic, has a low melting point, and has good wear resistance. Various grades with different Brinell hardness and microstructure can be produced. The method of production is detailed, and the many applications of ductile iron are shown. 730419. Efficient Use of Investment Castings. William S. Petch, Hitchiner Manufacturing Co., Inc. Metal castings made from patterns of wax or another expendable material have been made for about 4000 years. When the need for large quantities of turbine blades arose in World War II, the "lost wax" or investment casting method was brought into use. Investment casting produces a part with close tolerances and good surface finish, and can result in considerable cost savings on particular items while improving the product. 730420. The Relationship of Engineering to a Business Enterprise. William J. Lux, John Deere Dubuque Tractor Works. The job of an engineering department is defined in terms of its relationship to the business enterprise. This estab- lishes the perspective between the engineering department and the parent enterprise. Two basic assumptions are made: that the business requires product engineering and that the business is not a research institute or contract engineering organization. The author then takes his premises through incorrect concepts of engineering, the engineering job, design or synthesis, paperwork, level of confidence, and cost. 1973 SA E Transactions 730421. The Team Approach as it Relates to Keeping Prototype Builds on Schedule. T. O. Goodney, John Deere Dubuque Tractor Works. Building new or updating existing prototype test vehicles presents fabrication and assembly problems that require special attention. The build team is a management tool that helps keep prototype builds progressing smoothly. The company benefits by closely following established schedules while working within a given budget. The individual finds personal satisfaction in realizing that he is making a real contribution to the prototype. 730422. Engineering Management for Multinational Pro- duction. Carl L. Kepner, Caterpillar Tractor Co. In presenting the subject, the author selects an example 730418-730425 multinational company which builds identical models in the home country plant and in one or more overseas plants. The paper then discusses the many areas requiring corporate engineering policy to be established. Within these general plicies, there are a number of choices available in execution, both at the parent plant engi- neering locations and the overseas engineering locations. 730423. Acceptance Testing or Construction Equipment. C. P. Killough, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Four acceptance test programs and delineation of re- sponsibilities for determining acceptability of construction equipment prior to shipment from the factory are discussed. The test programs are referred to as Pre- production Acceptance Tests (performed on preproduc- tion prototype units), Product Evaluation Tests (per- formed on initial production units of new models), Quality Conformance Inspection (performed on each production unit), and Customer Acceptance Test (performed on random sample units from production). They are four of many procedures by which the quality manager manages product quality by detection, correction, and prevention of defects. Machines are looked at from the positive viewpoint of acceptability - not just defects - and must pass these tests before they can be shipped from the factory. The quality manager has full responsibility for the quality of products shipped and for customer acceptance of products. The need for these four test programs, their objectives, and, in general, their differences are described. 730424. Army View of Acceptance Tests. George W. Daneker, U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Com- mand. Two recent events have occurred that alter the Army view of acceptance of earthmoving equipment. First, the Army was reorganized and second, a new materiel acquisition policy was published. The reorganization eliminated Continental Army Command and U.S. Army Combat Developments Command and formed Forces Command and Training and Doctrine Command. In addition, U.S. Army Materiel Command was reoriented and the re- sponsibility for construction equipment shifted to U.S. Army Tank- Automotive Command. The new materiel acquisition policy's main points seek to minimize cost, shorten development, and assure adequate performance. To accomplish this, a 6-year development cycle was established with decision points following each phase of developmental testing and operational test. Since earth- moving equipment is considered a nonmajor item, the Test and Evaluation Command (TECOM), as part of the development test (DT III), will complete the Army's acceptance tests. The TECOM philosophy, mission, and organization are presented with the conclusion being that the Army must assure that the equipment will meet its requirements "on demand." 730425. Performance of a Medium-Sized Track-Type Tractor Subjected to Military Land-Clearing 135</page><page sequence="59">730426-730435 Operations in Vietnam. Douglas B. Uthus, U. S. Army Mobility Equip. Res. &amp; Dev. Center. The military land-clearing conducted in the tropical vegetation of Vietnam was the largest operation of its kind ever undertaken. Teams of basically commercial track- type tractors with commercial land-clearing accessories were used to achieve the task. Equipment operation and maintenance was performed by military personnel. This paper discusses the problems encountered with the tractor and its accessories in the military, tropical environment, and the modifications to the tractor and accessories that evolved from the operation. 730426. Equipment Operations in the Athabasca Tar Sands. A. R. Allen, Great Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. This paper describes the mining operations in the Athabasca Tar Sands in Alberta, Canada. The devel- opment of the mine is detailed, along with the earth- moving equipment required. Experience to date has revealed a number of problems which the earthmoving industry will have to solve: extreme cold weather which affects all phases of vehicle operation, nature of the terrain, nature of the tar sand itself which is a frozen lumpy mass that can interfer with vehicle operation, maintenance, parts service. This experience is described, and some solutions offered. 730427. Engine Exhaust Noise Test Facility. Kenneth C. Kirkland, Stemco Manufacturing Co., Inc. A patented test facility has been developed for the purpose of analyzing exhaust noise emissions. The facility isolates the exhaust system noise source and allows noise tests to be conducted under the SAE J366a test site conditions. The exhaust system is piped and positioned in a manner similar to that found on the vehicle. Noise tests are conducted under steady state engine speed and load settings resulting in a high repeatability of test data. 730429. Systems Approach for the Control of Intake and Exhaust Noise. Vincent P. Byrne and John E. Hart, Donaldson Co., Inc. An intake and exhaust system mathematical model has been developed with the ability to predict the effects of specific acoustical elements on acoustic system per- formance. This paper discusses typical systems, the acoustical elements that make up the system, and a mathematical modeling of a system. It will also cover the effects of changing acoustical elements - exhaust and tail pipe lengths - on a noise spectrum. 730430. Utilizing a Concept Excavator to Minimize Development Time. E. R. Blood, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A multipronged approach of field testing, endurance testing, and laboratory testing was used during devel- opment of an excavator. Extensive application of a concept vehicle was used to meet increasing pressure on development groups to minimize time and money, and meet their objective of developing a safe, reliable, productive, profitable, and salable product. The vehicle was also used to further define the application spectrum, structural loadings, performance, reliability, and serviceability. 730432. A New Concept - The 950 Tree Harvester. R. L. Moser, Caterpillar Tractor Co. This paper presents a new concept in tree harvesting, whereby the tree is partly supported by the ground during delimbing to reduce the size of the machine. The harvester unit, which is mounted on a basic wheel loader and operated from the implement circuit with simplified controls, cuts and fells the tree, then delimbs as the tractor travels back to the bunching pile. Delimbing is finished and the tree topped as the tractor travels forward to the next tree. Operation of the unit and major components are described. 730433. Earthmoving Equipment Cab Design. Gardner P. Burton, Industrial Cab Co. The history of the development of enclosed cab design is discussed. The advent of mechanical power meant that attention could be given to making the equipment operator more comfortable with respect to seating, work space, air conditioning, and visibility. These items are discussed, along with the improvements in rollover protection and noise control. 730434. Operator Seating: Design Trends and Require- ments for Earthmoving Equipment. John W. Carter, Sears Manufacturing Co. This up-to-date review of dimensional requirements and necessary adjustments for operator seats on earthmoving equipment is consistent with the most current information regarding operator size range. A significant improvement incorporates full-foam cushions and molded covers, with cushion firmness and damping specifications. Particular emphasis is also placed on a recent manufacturing method wherein the polyurethane foam of the seat cushion is integrally bonded within the molded cover so as to provide numerous benefits. Finally, as a measure to protect operators from prevalent shock and vibration, increased usage of suspension seating rather than simple seat cushions is recommended. 730435. Noise Legislation and Its Implications to Indus- try. Donald E. Baxa, University of Wisconsin. Noise control has been greatly accelerated by recent legislation affecting industry and its products. The overall effect is still far from complete since the standards provided for by the Noise Control Act of 1972 have not been established. This paper considers the historic cases and laws in the United States which have had and will have the effect of 136</page><page sequence="60">bringing quiet to the citizens of this country. The legal developments included are, Wisconsin's Occupational Hearing Loss Compensation Law, the Walsh-Healey Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Chicago Noise Ordinance, and the Noise Control Act of 1972. A review of the standards presented by each piece of legislation will be given, and their effects on both industry and its products will be pointed out. 730436. Effectiveness of Contaminant Exclusion Devices. E. C. Fitch, Oklahoma State University. The contamination level of the fluid within a hydraulic system is a reflection of not only the particle removal capability of the filter element, but also the contaminant ingression characteristics of the system. Furthermore, the amount of contaminant permitted to enter the fluid past exclusion devices has a direct influence on the filter requirements - separation efficiency and capacity. Thus, without some means of establishing the effectiveness of contaminant exclusion devices, no relaistic analysis can be made regarding the contamination level of a hydraulic system. This paper presents the analytical expressions that can be used to describe rigorously the contamination control of a hydraulic system. The importance of contaminant ingression is dramatically illustrated by realistic test results. The correlation of the theoretical considerations with characteristic field conditions is accomplished using the results of a wiper seal study. The interpretation expounded is unique and has broad implications in the earthmoving industry. 1973 SA E Transactions 730437. A Manufacturer's Approach to "U" Seal Devel- opment. I. L. McMillen, Garlock, Inc. This paper outlines a seal manufacturer's development of a single lip seal for reciprocating hydraulic cylinders. It traces the development of functional test equipment and a uniform method for evaluating the performance of seals. Leakage observations proved that the newly developed "U" seal would repeatedly provide virtually leakfree operation. The visual evidence of frictional heat degra- dation, compression set deformation, and extrusion on other seals tested illustrated that the new compound is a superior material for hydraulic cylinder service. 730438. BART - Earthmoving and Mass Transit. David G. Hammond, Bay Area Rapid Transit District. This paper gives a description of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in San Francisco. The design and construction of the system depended upon the geography of the area and upon the equipment and skills of the many contractors involved - all of which are described. Details are given of the excavation for tunnels and stations and the equipment used in these operations. The design of the vehicles on the BART system was aimed toward passenger safety and comfort, and some details of the cars are shown. BART may be a model for rapid-transit devel- 730436-730442 opment in communities where mass-transit systems will help solve urban transportation problems. 730439. Personal Rapid Transit (with Special Reference to the Morgantown Project). J. P. Cunliffe, Frederic R. Harris, Inc. Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) is a new member of the transportation family primarily oriented toward short- haul and distributor/circulator operations. It can also be used in a quasi line-haul situation. The system utilizes small vehicles on a separate guideway (on, above, and below ground) to convey individuals from origin to destination without intermediate stops. Vehicles are operated entirely automatically and respond directly to passenger demand without any significant waiting period. They are rubber-tired and electrically powered, and therefore nonpollutant and silent in operation. The system is centrally controlled and supervised. The PRT project was inaugurated in Morgantown, West Virginia, on Oct. 24, 1972. The installation is a combination line-haul and circulatory system over excep- tionally difficult terrain, providing a testing ground for the design and implementation of this new technology. 730440. Earthmoving for People Moving - Expansion of the New York City Transit System. John A. Tremko, New York City Transit Authority. The expansion of the New York City Rapid Transit System, funded by a voter-approved $25 billion trans- portation bond issue in 1967, is described. Fifty-two miles of new subway routes will be constructed, along with other on-going modernization of the system. Eleven new routes will be constructed under the program. The work and type of equipment presently used in constructing four of these routes is described in some detail. 730441. Funk's Planetary Input Drive - Engineering and Application. Harry Bendure, Funk Manufactur- ing Co. This paper discusses the design and development of the Funk two-speed planetary input drive. A detailed de- scription of the "power shift" concept through the use of hydraulically actuated spring returned clutch packs is presented. Diagrams which display the internal operation and trace the power flow through the drivetrain are presented for clarification along with simplified circuitry diagrams of the developmental hydraulic system. Developmental testing to substantiate product relia- bility and unit performance is reported, along with some typical applications where the two-speed input drive could be employed. 730442. An Automatic Transmission for Off-Highway Vehicles. J. W. Schmidt and K. B. Harmon, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The continuing improvement and development of off- 137</page><page sequence="61">730443-730448 highway vehicles working has demanded corresponding continuing advancements in transmission technology. As a result, Detroit Diesel Allison will introduce, in 1973, the Allison CLBT 750 fully automatic transmission for service in the off-highway market of 20-35 ton trucks and 15-20 yd scrapers. The CLBT 750 transmission was designed as a five-speed unit with automatic shift modes for second through fifth ranges. Design activity on the transmission included development of a hydraulic controls system which would provide optimum shifting for all conditions of engine and vehicle speeds and loads while ensuring that those shifts, both up and down, are smooth, positive, and safe. The design activity also included development of a minimum size, high capacity, highly responsive retarder to ensure safe descent of steep grades. In addition to the engineering, logic, design tech- niques, and development testing described in the paper, the author outlines, in general, an engineering approach to successful new product design. 730443. Loads and Overloads - Their Effect on Product Life. M. J. Hapeman and F. C. Kreitler, General Electric Co. Product design engineers have the responsibility for developing a product yielding satisfactory life for some given duty, at a reasonable cost. In the absence of an immediate failure, a product is many times subjected to loading which exceeds the design parameters, resulting in unanticipated short life and possibly poor product acceptance. Often, the ultimate user of a product, with little knowledge of the extensive effects of overloading, justifies this practice with false economics. It is the purpose of this paper to illustrate the relationship of loading to product life. With this basic understanding, it is hoped that products will be used more effectively, and not abused. 730444. Mechanical System Behavior and Mathematical Simulation. Bruce W. Miers, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The dynamic response of mechanical systems can be anticipated by the use of mathematical simulation. The procedure for a proper dynamic investigation as part of the design effort is illustrated. Simulation of mechanical system response can result in dynamically compatible systems at reduced devel- opmental cost. 730445. Digital Computer Simulation of Relief Valve Response. Hugh C. Morris, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A mathematical model and digital computer simulation were used to predict dynamic response characteristics of a spool type of relief valve. This simulation resulted in design changes to achieve performance. The effects of several valve design parameters on valve performance are shown along with results of actual valve tests. Some of the parameters included are: reaction orifice, damping orifice, metering edge overlap, and oil properties. 730446. Finite Element Method - Structure Analysis by Simulation. Yuan Huang, International Har- vester Co. Finite element method has proved, in recent years, to be a powerful tool for structure analysis by engineers. Many finite element programs have been developed for this purpose by universities and research institutes using very large, powerful computers and relatively small computers. This resulted in the development of both, small special purpose programs that solve specialized problems, and giant general purpose programs that can solve static, dynamic, thermal, etc., structural problems with labo- ratory tested accuracy. This is a discussion of our experience in the selection and application of one such finite element computer programs named Structure Analysis Program, or SAP. 730447. New Technologies and the Energy Crisis. J. Frederick Weinhold, The Energy Policy Project. This paper concerns the energy crisis and the earthmoving industry's relationships to it. The crisis is not one problem but a series of immediate issues involving economics and institutional change coupled with longer term issues of environmental degradation and resource depletion. New technologies for energy supply coupled with better utilization of existing supplies provide the long term answer. 730448. Equipment Needs to Meet the Challenge of Surface Mining of Coal and Uranium in the Decade Ahead. M. I. Ritchie, Utah International Inc. This paper focuses on the 1975-1985 period in attempting to demonstrate the equipment requirements in the coal and uranium industries for that period. It has been necessary to make a number of far-reaching estimates with regard to future demand for the two commodities, as well as for strip ratios and equipment performance. However, the projections indicate the magnitude, both in terms of quantity and growth potential, of the industry needs and, as such, should provide equipment manu- facturers with useful information for the future. In the coal industry, it appears that both stripping and mining equipment needs will grow at a rate of 10- 12%/year in the future. This equipment will not be radically different from that used today even though some increases in size will probably occur in some equipment lines. The emphasis will be upon improvement in present generation machinery. The same may also be true in the uranium industry. Growth rates on the order rates on the order of perhaps 50%/year will be experienced as the utility industry continues to install plants using nuclear fuels. It appears that most of the equipment will be similar to that used today. 138</page><page sequence="62">730449. Increasing the Output of Underground Coal Mines in the Decade Ahead. William Laird, Eastern Associated Coal Corp. The multi-entry system of mining the Pittsburgh Seam, Federal No. 2 Mine is described, as is the room and pillar retreat mining method. Next, the author notes that a relatively static technology, federal mining laws, and ecological requirements have contributed to lower pro- duction and increased mining costs, causing problems for the industry. Various possible solutions to these problems are offered. Finally, current research and development projects are discussed, and future developments predicted. 730463. Development of a Low-Emission and High- Performance 2-Stroke Gasoline Engine (NiCE). Souk Hong Jo, Japan Automobile Research Institute, Inc., Pan Do Jo, Institute of Industrial Science, Tokyo University; Tsutomu Gomi, Sophia University; and Shigeru Ohnishi, Nippon Clean Engine Research Institute. An important advantage of the 2-stroke cycle gasoline engine is that its emission of NOx is very low. Experi- mental models of this engine showed that its percentage of exhaust gas contaminants could be made sufficiently low to meet the specified 1976 standard. Proper control of gas flow into the cylinder produced smooth combustion at idling. Thus, in the experimental model described in this paper, the usual drawbacks of the conventional engine (vibration, noise, knocking) have been eliminated so that vibration, power output, and fuel consumption are comparable to those found in a 4-stroke engine, without using an exhaust treatment system. 1973 SAE Transactions 730464. An Engineer Looks at Consumerism. J. C. Ellis, 1973 SAE President. What is this consumerism? What is its genesis? And why does it have such influence on our affairs? To the author, these are important questions and, although it may not be possible to answer them with any clear consensus, he thinks they are worthy of our consideration. He has tried to answer them to his own satisfaction and his collected thoughts are recorded in this brief paper. 730465. The Plastic Car. Hermann Hablitzel, Volks- wagenwerk AG. The use of plastics by the automotive industry is gaining momentum, but their ultimate application as material for an all-plastic car, including the body and associated operating functions, hovers in the background. This paper examines carefully, and supports by test data and known materials properties, the practicability of this develop- ment. It points out the range of problems that must be solved before functional implementation, producibility, and economic manufacture on a mass-volume basis can be achieved. The conclusion reached is that compromises must be made and that these objectives are attainable in the present only by a happy marriage of metal and 730449-730470 plastics, with each type of material contributing its superior qualities. 1973 SAE Transactions 730466. Categorization of Disabilities &amp; Functional Lim- itations Imposed in the Driving Task. A. M. Mayyasi, P. E. Pulley, W. A. Hyman and A. E. Swarts, Texas A&amp;M University. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate and expand on the categorization of disabilities as they specifically relate to the driving task. The authors use the example of an amputee to derive the design parameters characteristic of a given disability. A lengthy table detailing the categories of amputation is included, and a discussion of the table in relation to driving an automobile is presented. 730467. The Handicapped and the Driving Task. Milton D. Rhoads, Oklahoma State University. Handicapped people can be taught to drive. This paper stresses the "family car" concept. If possible, the car should be adapted with special controls for the handi- capped that do not preclude the car being driven by the able-bodied family members. Considerable attention is given to existing optional equipment that will assist the handicapped in performing the driving task. The ultimate goal for the handicapped is complete independence: enter the car, perform the driving task, and exit the car unassisted. 730469. A Complete One-Handed Pistol-Grip Automobile Controller. A. M. Mayyasi, P. E. Pulley and A. E. Swarts, Texas A&amp;M University. Research in the development of assistive devices (power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, etc.) is geared to close the gap between the handicapped and the normal operator. This objective is accomplished by providing additional assistive devices that will not inter- fere with the normal operation of the vehicle , but will enable the disabled individual safely to operate the same vehicle. This is achieved by considering the anthropo- metric and biomechanical constraints of the impaired driver. The pistol-grip controller is discussed in detail. It is intended to control manipulation of the steering wheel, brakes, lights, horn, windshield wiper, windows, etc. 730470. Complete Single-Footed Automobile Controller. A. M. Mayyasi, P. E. Pulley and A. E. Swarts, Texas A&amp;M University. The control logic of a single-footed automobile controller is described. Intended for use by handicapped drivers, the controller can control the transmission control sequence* turn signals, steering wheel, brakes, horn, etc. The single-footed controller was developed basically for the amputee with one good leg. The mechanics and logic of the SFC can be modified into several types of "lap board" controls for use by paraplegics or quadriplegics. 139</page><page sequence="63">730471-730478 730471.

Some of the mobility problems faced by the spinal cord injury patient are presented in this paper. Existing automobile hand controls for the handicapped are discussed and current efforts at evaluation and stan- dardization of this equipment are described. Design constraints are outlined for the development of new equipment to allow the more severely handicapped to drive. 730472. Advanced Concepts in Automobile Driver Con- trols. David H. Harden, Rehabilitation Institute, Inc.; and David M. Tenniswood, Gemco Elec- tric Co. Finger-operated driver controls which connect directly to the carburetor and power brake servo valve offer driving ability to the handicapped not able to operate conven- tional hand controls. Mechanical servo connections eliminate the need for pushrod and lever connections to the foot pedals. Use of a set of control modules with the direct connections offers all drivers a safe and versatile control system requiring much less effort and range of motion. Safety results from smooth positive control action and from an auxiliary power backup system. Versatility results from the direct connections and low effort and travel required by this new system. Optimum "feel" is obtained by proper combination of the force and displacement feedback loops built into the system connections. Addi- tion of optional modules for control of lights, wipers, seats, etc., enable this modular concept to offer completely independent automobile travel to handicapped people previously unable to drive an automobile. 730474. An Evaluation of the Performance and Emissions of a CFR Engine Equipped with a Prechamber. D. B. Wimmer and R. C. Lee, Phillips Petroleum Co. An experimental study of a naturally aspirated, spark- ignited prechamber mounted in a CFR engine demon- strated that this system provides a marked improvement in lean-mixture combustion both before and after engine warm-up. In the system tested, a premixed fuel-air mixture containing five times the stoichiometric amount of fuel was supplied to the prechamber at a rate of 2% of the main chamber mixture flow. The fuel-rich flame issuing from the prechamber provided an ignition source capable of igniting main chamber mixtures much leaner than those normally ignitable by a standard spark plug. There are many advantages and disadvantages when comparing the standard CRF engine with the prechamber CFR engine. This paper goes on to explain the pre- chamber engine in detail and to compare it with the standard engine. Discussion: J. L.

Kunihiko Komiyama, Komatsu, Ltd. (Japan) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and John B. Heywood, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An improved theoretical model that predicts the nitric oxide concentration in the exhaust of a spark-ignition engine has been evaluated over a wide range of fuel-air ratios, percentage of exhaust gas recycled, and engine speed. Experiments were carried out in a standard CFR single-cylinder engine. Comparison of the measured and calculated exhaust nitric oxide concentrations shows good agreement over all operating conditions. It is shown that in lean mixtures, nitric oxide concentrations freeze early in the expansion stroke. For rich mixtures, freezing occurs later after all the charge has been burned and substantial nitric oxide decomposition takes place. In addition, effects of exhaust gas recirculation on flame speed, ignition delay, and cycle-to-cycle pressure variations were evaluated. A simple model relating cycle-to-cycle variations with changes in ignition delay is presented. 1973 SA E Transactions 730476. A Single-Cylinder Engine Study of the Effects of Fuel Type, Fuel Stoichiometry, and Hydrogen- to-Carbon Ratio on CO, NO, and HC Exhaust Emissions. J. A. Harrington and R. C. Shishu, Ford Motor Co. The effect of variation in fuel composition on exhaust emissions from a single-cylinder engine has been studied with eleven different fuels. Exhaust emissions, at fixed engine speed and load, were measured over a range of air-fuel ratio (A/F) settings. At identical A/F values, CO, HC, and NO emissions varied significantly from fuel to fuel. At the same equivalence ratio (o), CO emissions were identical for all fuels. However, at fixed o values, both NO and HC decreased with increasing fuel hydrogen-to- carbon ratio. 730478. (SP-382) The Relationship of Low-Temperature Rheology to Engine Oil Pumpability. Michael L. McMillan and Chester K. Murphy, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. An analysis of oil pumpability reveals that engine oil pumping failures may occur because either the oil cannot flow under its own head to the oil screen inlet, or the oil is too viscous to flow through the screen and inlet tube fast enough to satisfy pump demands. To determine which factor is controlling the behavior of commercial, multi- graded oils was observed visually at temperatures from -40 to 0°F (-40 to -17.8°C) in a laboratory oil pump- ability test apparatus. Test results revealed that pumping failures occur by the first alternative: a hole is formed in the oil, and the surrounding oil is unable to flow into the hole fast enough to satisfy the pump. Of 14 oils tested, 7 failed to be pumped because of air binding or cavitation which developed in this manner. A model, which explains 140</page><page sequence="64">these failures in terms of yield point considerations and the low shear apparent viscosity of the oils, is proposed. 1973 SAE Transactions 730479. (SP-382) Proposed Laboratory Methods for Predicting the Low-Temperature Pumpability Properties of Crankcase Oils. R. M. Stewart, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co.; and M. F. Smith, Jr., Paramins Labs. The inability of certain crankcase oils to flow and lubricate an engine at low temperature and the lack of a suitable bench test to predict this characteristic are of current concern to engine builders and oil formulators. Two critical areas of oil flow at very low temperatures have been recognized by SAE and ASTM subcommittees. These are: the ability of an oil to flow to the oil screen of an engine fast enough to prevent "air binding," and its ability to be drawn through the oil screen and pump inlet tubing without causing "pump cavitation." The interre- lation between these two factors is discussed and some engine pumpability data are presented which illustrate how one of these factors may affect the other. Descriptions of four new bench tests are presented along with data to show their ability to predict the low-temperature pumpability properties of crankcase oils. 1973 SAE Transactions 730480. (SP-382) Engine Oil Pumpability and Related Properties. A. R. Nolf, Oakville Research Centre, Shell Canada Ltd. A bench test has been developed to simulate the ability of engine crankcase oil to flow from the sump to the pump inlet. The design of the system is geometrically equivalent to that found in a Chevrolet 230 CID L-6 engine. A number of crankcase lubricants have been evaluated in the rig to determine the effects of V.l. improver chemistry, soak time, fuel diluent content, and pour point on pumping rig delivery. In a more detailed phase of this study, the cold flow properties of 10 commercial oils have been compared to pumping rig results obtained at -20 and -30° F. The data suggest that the Brookfield viscometer is a more reliable indicator of oil pumpability than the GM pour time, CCS viscosity, or ASTM pour point. 730481. (SP-382) Low Shear Viscometry and Cold Flow Mechanism- Engine Oils. F. F. Tao and W. E. Waddey, Esso Research and Engineering Co. The viscosity-shear dependence of multiviscosity oils measured in a rotary viscometer at low shear rates fits the Power Law model, relating viscosity to shear rate. A simulated oil pan rig permitted calculation of critical shear conditions and viscosities for engine pumpability. Critical conditions of apparent viscosity and shear stress were computed to be 400 poise at 5000 dynes/cm2 from data on a series of ASTM reference pumpability oils. 1973 SAE Transactions 730479-730485 730482. (SP-382) Simulation of Severe Shear Conditions in Lubrication. J. Jakobsen, D. M. Sanborn and W. O. Winer, Georgia Institute of Technology. The importance of high shear conditions in automotive lubrication is discussed with respect to the influence on lubricant rheological properties. The distribution of shearing effects in lubricated components is also dis- cussed. Two methods of simulating high shear condi- tions-an elastohydrodynamic lubrication simulator and a capillary viscometer- are presented, along with some data obtained from them on polymer containing oils. 1973 SAE Transactions 730483. (SP-382) A Method for Determining the Influ- ence of Multigraded Oils on Journal Bearing Performance. Richard C. Rosenberg, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. An experimental technique has been developed to meas- ure the minimum oil film thickness of dynamically loaded journal bearings. Inductive transducers were used to measure the motion of the journal within the bearing clearance and with this information the relative oil film thickness was determined. The measured film thickness correlated closely with analytically predicted values for five base oils. However, tests on four oils which met the SAE multiviscosity engine oil classification (three SAE 10W-30 and one SAE 10W-40) showed that the low shear rate viscosity of these oils could not be used to predict the bearing oil film thickness developed by these oils. 1973 SAE Transactions 730484. (SP-382) A Rating System for Viscosity Index Improvers. J. V. Brancato and Wildrick Hart, Witco Chemical Corp. The purpose of the work reported in this paper was to develop a simple and reliable method of comparing the relative merits of various polymers in a homogeneous system of base oils that might be used in multigraded motor oil applications. It was demonstrated that by using consistent methods of tests, comparisons between poly- mers can be made, that more clearly define the properties of the polymers than methods that have been used in the past. It was determined that in a series of polymers of the same molecular type, those polymers with the lowest molecular weight will have the greatest shear stability. The contribution to low shear, low-temperature viscosity varies widely with variations in molecular type. A rating factor can be produced which is relatively constant for polymers of the same molecular type regardless of molecular weight. 730485. (SP-382) A Bench Scale Engine Test for Shear Stability of Multigrade Engine Oils. A. F. Talbot, W. A. Wright and H. I. Morris, Sun Oil Co. A procedure is described which employs an air-cooled, 4-cycle, single-cylinder engine of the type often found on lawn and garden equipment, driven by an electric motor at 3100 rpm. 141</page><page sequence="65">730486-730491 The equipment is simple, inexpensive, and requires a modest volume of sample. Results compare favorably with the shear stability tests of a series of 13 oils prepared and field-tested in a 78 vehicle fleet by Subsection B-l of ASTM Division VII of Committee D 2. The degree of correlation is comparable to that observed in several tests conducted in full size laboratory engine stands, and superior to that recently reported for a variety of non-engine bench tests (pump rigs, sonic oscillator, dispersion mill). Viscosity losses are also reported for a variety of commercial 10W-40 grade service station engine oils, when tested by this procedure. 730486. (SP-382) The Rheology of ASTM ARO Series Mechanical Shear Stability Reference Oils. John F. Gyer, Mobil Research and Development Corp. Viscosities at high and low shear rates were measured both before and after mechanical shear for the 12 ARO multigrade engine oils of the ASTM D 2, R &amp; D VII-B Mechanical Shear Stability Program. The oils were divided into two groups by ANsp, the difference between low shear rate specific viscosity at 98.9 and 37.8°C (210 and 100°F). The positive ANsp group suffered the greater average low shear rate permanent viscosity loss. Per- manent viscosity loss at high shear rates- where most machine operation occurs- was significantly less than at low shear rates for both groups. In several cases, the low shear rate permanent viscosity loss was nearly equal to the new oil temporary viscosity loss. Several of these oils became nearly Newtonian after mechanical shear. Long- term storage produced measurable viscosity recovery in some sheared oils. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that polymer entanglements exist in conventional multigrade oils. The disruption of entangle- ments by mechanical shear leads to the observed rapid initial viscosity degradation of multigrade oils. The mechanism of mechanical shear is enough different from the mechanism of sonic shear (ASTM D 2603) to account for the different results of the two techniiques. 1973 SA E Transactions 730487. (SP-382) Behavior of Non-Newtonian Lubricants in High Shear Rate Applications. R. L. Stam- baugh and R. J. Kopko, Rohm and Haas Co. The role of non-Newtonian fluid characteristics in lubricant performance was studied in a variety of V.l. improved lubricants. It was shown that proper choice of V.l. improver can yield a lubricant which undergoes both small temporary and permanent viscosity losses, thus giving nearly Newtonian behavior but with high and low temperature performance advantages over straight min- eral oils. In hydraulic fluids, it was shown that different V.l. improvers resulted in varying amounts of internal leakage in both vane and internal gear pumps. In the case of vane pumps, the favorable Newtonian characteristics of shear-stable V.l. improvers assured outstanding pumping performance. It is believed that control of transmission leak-down was primarily responsible for the favorable influence a shear-stable V.l. improver had on the maxi- mum transmission sump temperature at which the wide- open throttle 2-3 upshift will take place. Finally, the shear stability of the V.l. improver in engine oils was shown to influence journal wear protection provided by that oil. 1973 SA E Transactions 730489. Simulation and Measurement of Driver Vehicle Handling Performance. W. Lincke, Volkswagen- werk AG (Germany); B. Richter, Volkwagen- werk AG (Germany); and R. Schmidt, Volks- wagenwerk AG (Germany). Test series were run on subjects in a motor vehicle simulator and in actual motor vehicles. The test objective was to study the correlations among the subjective evaluation of vehicle handling qualities, test measure- ments, and various characteristics. Although the data presented in this paper should be considered only a first step, the comparison of simulator results with road test results yielded good data correlation. It was found in both cases that the vehicle response rate (for example, yaw angle velocity) on a sudden steering angle step input exerts much greater influence on the judgment and the per- formance of the test subject than does, for instance, vehicle damping. 1973 SA E Transactions 730490. Development of Motor Vehicle Handling Per- formance Requirements. R. Limpert, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. The discussion presented in this paper addresses the difficulties associated with defining safe motor vehicle handling performance. Specific problems relating to the vehicle, the driver, and the environment are highlighted. Research activities performed and anticipated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are evaluated in terms of a more fundamental approach to a general formulation of the vehicle handling problem. The aim of these investigations is to identify those vehicles that become overinvolved in highway accidents and, together with other evaluation criteria on vehicle handling, will clearly indicate whether these vehicles exhibit performance boundaries which are beyond the capabilities of the typical driver. 730491. Refinement and Application of Open-Loop Limit-Maneuver Response Methods. Robert D. Ervin, Paul S. Fancher and Leonard Segel, Highway Safety Research Institute, The Uni- versity of Michigan. An open-loop limit-maneuver test methodology was refined from an earlier study which hypothesized a relationship between vehicle performance and highway safety. Refinements in methodology were attained in the areas of test apparatus, test procedure, data processing, and performance interpretation. 142</page><page sequence="66">Open-loop response measurements were conducted on a representative sample of 12 contemporary passenger vehicles.

Measurement and Subjective Evaluation of Ve- hicle Handling. Walter Bergman, Product Test Operations Office, Ford Motor Co. This paper analyzes the nature of vehicle handling in real-world situations and shows the importance of the driver. It introduces a new concept which provides a basis for quantitative determination of vehicle-handling qual- ities directly related to driver physical and mental efforts required for control of the vehicle. This paper focuses on each of vehicle control and not on the level of vehicle performance as constituting the most important vehicle- handling quality. There is a description of rigorously designed subjective evaluation techniques employed in developing vehicle designs for determinations of each of vehicle control. A new method is introduced to quantitatively determine the evaluator's ability to appraise the ease of vehicle control. Vehicle directional response properties affecting the ease of vehicle control are identified, and new criteria ex- pressing these properties are introduced. Test procedures to measure relevant vehicle directional response properties are developed. Good correlation is established between measurements and subjective evaluation. 730493. Continuous Secondary Air Modulation - Its Effect on Thermal Manifold Reactor Perform- ance. Donald J. Pozniak and Robert M. Sie wert, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Secondary air scheduling and average delivery rate have a great influence on the performance (carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon cleanup) of rich thermal manifold reactors. A continuously modulated secondary air system was devised to provide a tailpipe air-fuel ratio that did not change significantly with engine speed or load when a "flat" carburetion calibration was incorporated. This system involved throttling the inlet of the air pump(s) so that the air pump and engine intake pressures were equal. The continuous air modulation system was compared with an unmodulated system and a step-modulated system. The secondary air systems were investigated with both GMR "small volume" cast iron thermal reactors and DuPont V thermal reactors on modified 350 CID V-8 engines in 1969 Chevrolet passenger vehicles. It was found that thermal reactor performance improved with each increase in control of the secondary air schedule. With the continuous air modulation system a reduction in CO emissions of approximately 45% (on the 1972 Federal Test Procedure emissions test) was achieved relative to an unmodulated system. None of the systems 730492-730497 tested, however, demonstrated the capability to achieve 1975-1976 Federal exhaust emission standards. Discussion: D. J. Patterson, University of Michigan.; Authors* closure 1973 SA E Transactions 730494. Measurement of Air Distribution in a Multi- cylinder Engine by Means of a Mass Flow Probe. W. R. Brandstetter and M. J. Carr, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. To lower emissions from a multicylinder engine, the air-fuel ratio must be optimized in all cylinders. If uniform fuel distribution is achieved, then the cylinder-to-cylinder air distribution is of particular interest. A probe system has been developed to measure mass flow rates to individual cylinders during operation of a complete engine. Fast response measurements of pressure, tem- perature, and flow velocity are made in the intake port near the valve during the intake portion of the cycle. High-speed collection of the large volume of data was accomplished through on-line use of an IBM 1800 computer. A V8 455 CID (7457 cm3) engine with stock intake and single exhaust system was used in the initial application of the mass flow probe. Measurements of 30-40 individual cycles were combined to calculate the mean volumetric efficiency for each cylinder. When measurements for all of the cylinders had been made, the cylinder-to-cylinder distributions were computed as de- viations from the overall average. Variations of ± 8% were typical during motored operation, with some cylinders deviating by as much as ± 12%. Fired operation produced variations greater than ±15%. No characteristic distri- bution was found to extend throughout the speed and load range tested. Typical cycle-to-cycle variations in the volumetric efficiency for individual cylinders were found to be ± 8%. 730496. Tire Reinforcement Needs of the Future. A. B. Beindorff, Monsanto Textiles Co. This paper is concerned with the forecasting of the tire industry, as seen by a supplier, with special emphasis on the possible future of steel as a reinforcement material and on some of the forces which may affect steel usage in the next decade. In making its forecasts of future reinforcement needs, Monsanto placed primary emphasis on projecting market shares by tire construction type: bias, bias belted, or radial, and on the reinforcement material of choice in each market segment. Current trends and forces shaping the future of the tire industry are analyzed, and graphs are presented of automotive production and a variety of tire projections from 1972-1982. 730497. Wire Tire Cord-Construction Requirements. Philip F. Murray, Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. A review of passenger tire construction and the engi- neering properties required of belt ply materials is 143</page><page sequence="67">730498-730505 presented. Comments are made on the areas of wire cord construction that must be investigated in order for the cost of wire cord to be reduced. Included are elastic modulus, dimensional stability, adhesion to rubber, environmental sensitivity, column strength, tensile strength, bending modulus, and endurance limit. The joint responsibilities of the equipment manufac- turers, wire cord manufacturers, and tire companies are discussed. 730498. Compounding for Wire Adhesion. M. P. Wagner, Chemical Div., PPG Industries, Inc. The adhesion of rubber to brassed steel wire is dependent upon many factors, all of which can be controlled reasonably well by the engineer or compounder. However, variables are present which may elude either identification or control. Most variables interact strongly with one another, thus making it difficult to establish firm com- pounding principles that are invariant under all condi- tions. Early literature on this topic is presented, and new developments in compounding for wire adhesion are discussed. The most effective alternate resin former is composed of hexamethoxymethylmelamine and a par- tially polymerized resorcinol-formaldehyde resin. 730499. Testing Steel Cords. M. F. Dague, R. J. Montag and E. L. Haines, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Product and materials evaluation testing has been revo- lutionized to meet the unique requirements of steel belted tires. Many of the classical cord and tire tests have been found to be inadequate and others to require modifi- cation. The development of many new test methods has been required. This paper discusses the tests used to characterize and evaluate steel for tires. These tests can be broadly divided into two categories: 1. Tests evaluating the steel cord material such as tensile properties and mechanical properties. 2. Tests evaluating the steel-rubber composite behav- ior such as adhesion and fatigue. Test parameters, data accumulation and treatment, and significance of test results are discussed. 730500. Mechanical Properties of Radial Tires. K. G. Peterson and R. E. Rasmussen, Proving Ground, General Motors Corp. Vehicle/tire system performance is mainly influenced by mechanical properties. This discussion is devoted to radial tires in general, although the data are mostly derived from tests of steel belted radiais. Also covered are dimension, handling, ride, traction, noise, and power loss perform- ance of the same tire. The authors conclude that no generic class of tire construction or particular design evaluated thus far is unquestionably superior for every performance parameter, although performance differences between generic classes of tires can be defined statistically. 1973 SA E Transactions 730502. Determination of Modal Properties of Automo- tive Bodies and Frames Using Transient Testing Techniques. T. Sisson, R. Zimmerman and J. Martz, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. This paper describes methods of determining modal stiffness, inertia, and damping properties of automotive bodies and frames using transient testing techniques. The test equipment described is a digital Fourier analyzer system. The hardware and software used to obtain transfer functions of the vehicle components is discussed, and several examples are presented which compare frequency response data generated by the Fourier analyzer to the same data generated by the more standard sinusoidal excitation methods. 1973 SA E Transactions 730503. Digital Filtering for Analysis of Structural Vibra- tions. D. E. Malen, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp.; and E. A. Vaughan, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. A digital signal analysis system to aid in compiling vibration test data is described. The objectives of the system are explained, mathematical properties are de- rived, and system operation is discussed with respect to hardware, characteristics, and sample output. This method for digital filtering of time series data has proved to be fast, effective, and an easily implemented method of analyzing structural properties. In addition to providing the design engineer with all of the traditional forms of output offered by analog systems, the computer- based nature of the digital filter system facilitates the use of large-scale dynamic simulations requiring mode iden- tification and other analytical software. 730504. Determination of Natural Frequencies and Mode Shapes of Chassis Frames. Robert J. George, The Budd Co. The objective of this paper was to establish the degree of correlation between the results obtained from a 3/8 scale plastic model, an actual frame, and a mathematical computer model. Results showed that a satisfactory dynamic simulation can be obtained from a scaled plastic model of the structure and that a mathematical model composed of beam elements is accurate at the lower frequencies but begins to differ with the actual frame at higher frequencies. 730505. Testing for an Automotive Frame to Determine Dynamic Properties. D. L. Flanigan, Ford Motor Co. The essentially modal behavior of an automotive chassis frame in the 0-30 Hz frequency range is confirmed by investigation of a typical frequency response. A math- ematical model is developed for which the parameters are to be obtained directly by analysis of vibration test data. The requirements are determined for the instrumentation system and laboratory test setup necessary to obtain accurate estimates of resonant frequencies, mode shapes, 144</page><page sequence="68">and modal mass and damping properties. The deter- mination and importance of the rigid body properties and the "residual compliance" of truncated modes are dis- cussed. Direct comparison of predicted frequency re- sponses with the original test data demonstrate the validity of the "test-derived model." 730506. Finite Element Dynamic Analysis of an Auto- motive Frame. V. J. Borowski, R. L. Steury and J. L. Lubkin, Ford Motor Co. Using several variations of a basic finite element model, the dynamic displacement response and mode shapes of an automotive frame have been predicted. Small im- provements in accuracy were noted when higher-order mass representation and allowance for shear deformation were included in the analysis. Modeling accuracy was significantly increased, however, by including certain effects which are normally ignored. These include an allowance for the less-than-perfect rigidity of siderail- to-crossmember joints; for the torsional behavior of short, open cross-section beams; and for the reduction of flexural inertia in welded, double-channel cross sections. With the introduction of these factors, the predicted natural frequencies for the first eight flexural modes can be correlated with test results to within 4%. For this level of agreement, the finite element model appears to be sufficiently accurate to be used in design evaluation of frames, prior to prototype construction. 730507. The UCLA Hydrogen Car: Design, Construction, and Performance. Joseph G. Finegold, Franklin E. Lynch, Nathaniel R. Baker, Robert Taka- hashi and Albert F. Bush, School of Engineering and Applied Science, UCLA. In order to offer a reasonable solution to environmental problems, a vehicle was built for entry in the 1972 Urban Vehicle Design Competition. The heart of this alternative to today's vehicles is a standard V-8 engine modified to use hydrogen as a fuel. This vehicle easily beats the 1976 federal exhaust emissions standards. Novel features of the modified 1972 Gremlin include a roll cage that lies above the roof which doubles as a luggage rack; foam between inside and outside body panels for body stiffness and impact absorption; proved 5 mph [2.2 m/s] crash bumpers utilizing popcorn as the energy-absorbing material; an engine parameter monitoring system; and improved visibility, lighting, braking, handling, and driver safety. The vehicle continues to be tested, is driven frequently, and interacts well in urban environment with the myriad of traffic situations encountered in Los Angeles. 1973 SA E Transactions 730508. Urban Vehicle Design Competition - A Practice in Design. Arthur C. Haman and Mark Critz, University of Detroit. Design activity on the University of Detroit's (U of D) entry in the 1972 Urban Vehicle Design Competition began in September 1971 with 60 senior engineering 730506-730510 students in an interdisciplinary design course. Preliminary design considerations for powerplant, power train, emis- sion controls, safety features, and styling were completed by December 1971. Development of hardware started in January 1972 with a 15-man team. Final configuration resulted in the modification of a 1970 Ford Maverick, shortened approximately 5 ft to a final length of 121 in and widened 1 ft to a width of 80 in. Features include 5 mph bumpers, automatic transmission, stratified charge engine, offset driveline, high level exterior lighting, side door beams, three occupant capacity, roll bar, front disc brakes, and electrically driven fan for cooling system. At the final competition at the General Motors Proving Grounds in early August 1972, the U of D entry, along with entries from 65 other universities from throughout the United States and Canada, was evaluated for: emissions, safety, noise, consumer cost, drivability, acceleration, braking, handling, energy efficiency, 5 mph bumpers, turning radius, parkability, space utilization, and overall size. The U of D urban vehicle design concept was awarded sixth place overall, and the top awards in safety and emissions for liquid fueled internal combustion engines. 730509. Experimental Urban Vehicle. Michael R. Seal, Western Washington State College. An experimental urban car was designed and built by Western Washington State College as an entry in the international Urban Vehicle Design Competition. The car was designed with a novel form of mid-engine rear drive chassis. A novel (pyramid link) rear suspension solves many problems. Extreme Ackerman steering allows a 9 ft turning radius. New systems were developed for adjust- able pedals, steering, and seat squab height. The chassis quick-disconnects into three major sections to facilitate servicing. A bias beam brake linkage allows easy ad- justment of front-rear brake bias. The low emission engine runs on propane and is equipped with a thermal reactor and an EGR system. The body chassis center unit is made from epoxy fiberglass surface aluminum honeycomb. Passive restraint seat belts are attached to semigull wing doors. Five mph bumpers are fitted to each end. The front uses extrusion bolts and the spare tire; the rear uses beverage cans in compression. A headrest window provides whiplash protection while the Ensolite foam-covered dash protects against impact. 1 973 SA E Transactions 730510. Prototype Urban Taxi: A New Approach. Don Robert Taylor and F. Del Coates, The Art School of the Society of Arts &amp; Crafts. A team of industrial design students designed and built a prototype urban taxi that overcomes several disadvan- tages of contemporary production taxis including: inad- equate interior driver and passenger space, bulky exterior dimensions, and inconvenience to physically handicapped 145</page><page sequence="69">730511-730516 passengers. The vehicle employs a diesel powerplant in the interest of operating economy, reliability, and decreased air pollution. The body, consisting of flat panels fastened to a simple steel rollcage, is suited to low volume production and simple maintenance. Aesthetically, the vehicle was designed to harmonize visually with the urban environment. 730511. Computer Simulation of the University of Wis- consin Hybrid-Electric Vehicle Concept. J. R. Winkelman and A. A. Frank, University of Wisconsin. The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and simulation of the urban vehicle power train system of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. The objective of the power train is high fuel efficiency as well as low emissions. Fuel efficiency is achieved by an on-off operation of the internal combustion engine with the "on" operation at only the minimum brake specific fuel consumption area. Emission control is partially achieved by utilizing an electric drive system for transient response. Furthermore, low emissions and fuel efficiency are bettered by tech- niques such as special starting without choke, no decel- eration, and no idle requirements on the internal com- bustion engine. 1973 SA E Transactions 730512. The University of Michigan Urban Vehicle. David W. Chicovsky, Thomas G. Chicovsky, John A. Roby and Chris P. Theodore, The University of Michigan. The design and construction of a Wankel-powered, rear-engine, rear-drive urban vehicle was undertaken by students in the engineering and industrial design curric- ulums at The University of Michigan. The goal of this group was to submit a competitive entry to the Urban Vehicle Design Competition conducted in August 1972, and hopefully to provide some fresh solutions to the problems of urban transportation. Constraints set by the UVDC Committee as well as proposed federal emission and safety standards were considered as governing parameters in the design process. This report describes some of the many features of the University of Michigan entry and includes a discussion of the primary merits of the project. 730513. Results of 1972 Urban Vehicle Design Compe- tition. Charles M. McCuen and M. Scott Matthews, Student Competitions on Relevant Engineering, Inc. In August 1972, the Urban Vehicle Design Competition (UVDC) completed an 18-month program of vehicle design and construction with a national testing event of all vehicles entered in the contest. Sixty-six vehicles from 62 universities in the United States and Canada competed for the top prize. The objectives of the competition were to promote a project-oriented approach to engineering education, as well as to provide students with the opportunity to contribute constructively in the effort to develop low-emission, safe urban vehicles. Some of the more innovative designs appeared in the following areas: 1. Low-pollution powerplan ts utilizing nonfossil fuels, thermal reactors, catalytic reactors, exhaust gas recircu- lation systems, and hybrid powerplants. 2. Drunk tester/antitheft devices. 3. Bumper systems capable of protecting a vehicle from damage in a 5 mph impact. 4. Overall integration of automotive systems in small vehicle design. A description of UVDC testing procedures, scoring results, and innovative designs is contained in this paper. 730514. (SP-383) Total Energy Situation in the United States. David R. Oliver, Office of Oil and Gas, U. S. Dept. of the Interior. In the past 20 years in the United States, the demand for energy has doubled, and it is expected to increase by 3.6% annually until the end of the twentieth century. This paper discusses the implications of the increased demand, and the resources needed to meet it. Nuclear power is seen as a partial answer, as is low-sulfur coal. Some untapped oil reserves are available in the United States, but oil will undoubtedly have to be imported to meet the demand. A concerted effort to conserve energy is needed to help hold imports to acceptable levels. 730515. (SP-383) Impact of Automotive Emissions Reg- ulations on Gasoline Demand. D. H. Clewell, Mobil Oil Corp.; and W. J. Koehl, Mobil Research and Development Corp. This paper reviews trends in car design and usage that have affected gasoline consumption in the past and discusses such factors as emission controls that will vehicles. Between 1973-1985, demand is expected to increase 50%, and perhaps 70% if the present 1976 oxides of nitrogen emission standard stays in effect. The paper explores ways to moderate this demand, in terms of relaxation of emission standards, increased use of smaller cars, and increased use of public transportation. 1973 SA E Transactions 730516. (SP-383) Current and Future Trends in United States Gasoline Supply. E. J. Cahill, Standard Oil Co. of California; and A. L. Grossberg, Chevron Research Co. This paper presents the outlook for gasoline supply and demand in the United States as now envisioned. It includes discussions of present oil supplies as well as future ones, of refinery capacity and its projected shortage, and of gasoline consumption and supply through 1976 and beyond. Without government and public support, it is doubtful that the necessary refinery capacity can be accomplished. 146</page><page sequence="70">730517. (SP-383) Fuel Consumption Trends in Today's Vehicles. Harold C. MacDonald, Ford Motor Co. This paper discusses fuel economy in present automobiles and shows that as vehicle weight has increased and emission controls have become more stringent, fuel economy has deteriorated and will probably continue to do so. Weight is seen as the significant factor in reduction of fuel economy and performance, and smaller cars are seen as a possible solution to the problem. 730518. (SP-383) Energy and the Automobile - General Factors Affecting Vehicle Fuel Consumption. G. J. Huebner, Jr. and Donald J. Gasser, Chrysler Corp. Since 1968, vehicle weight increases and emissions controls have reduced fuel economy substantially. Addi- tional losses in economy and acceleration will be expe- rienced through 1976. Recommendations are made to lessen the impact of the predicted losses. Factors influencing fuel economy and acceleration are examined for an intermediate car. Changes in engine efficiency and displacement, compression ratio, torque converter, transmission, axle ratio, aerodynamic drag, tires, accessories, vehicle weight, and emissions controls are examined. When practical, the effects of 10% changes are analyzed. Comparisons are also made with a sub- compact and a luxury vehicle. Discussion: P. S.

A review is made of available data on fuel economies of the current internal combustion engine-powered auto- mobiles and of those with alternative powerplants. Comparisons of fuel economies of all these engine systems are made on the basis of the vehicle weight/engine displacement, and the vehicle weight alone. The thermal efficiencies are also compared. It is shown that several versions of the diesel engine which meet the 1975 Clean Air Act Standards and which are on the road today are more efficient than the conventional internal combustion engine of 1973. Moreover, prototypes of other alternative systems, using other cycles (Brayton, Rankine, Stirling) under development are also projected to provide higher efficiencies than the conventional internal combustion engine of 1973. All comparisons are made using the federal driving cycle as a common reference. 730520. (SP-383) Synthetic Fuels for Transportation and National Energy Needs. Derek P. Gregory and Robert B. Rosenberg, Institute of Gas Tech- nology. The United States petroleum supplies cannot keep up with the demand made upon them by the use of automobiles. Increased importation of oil is not a satisfactory long-term solution. Supplies of coal, nuclear, and solar energy, 730517-730522 however, are abundant. We suggest that "clean" fuels could be synthesized from these resources by using these abundant materials. This paper examines the possibilities of making methanol, ethanol, hydrogen, and ammonia for use as vehicle fuels. In the short term, methanol and methanol-gasoline blends appear attractive. In the long term, hydrogen is ideal if its handling problems can be solved. 1973 SAE Transactions 730521. (SP-383) Mass Transit Impact on Energy Con- sumption. Robert Husted, U. S. Department of Transportation. The United States total transportation energy consump- tion represents 25% of our domestic consumption and 55% of our petroleum consumption, and it is expected to continue in these proportions in the foreseeable future. We currently have a petroleum import requirement that is projected to increase by the mid-1980's to 50% of the total petroleum consumption, comparable to the projected total transportation energy consumption at that time. The paper discusses the current structure of our transportation services and energy consumption, with particular empha- sis on the public transmit modes: bus, taxi, rapid transit, trolley, and commuter rail. Data are drawn from various sources and integrated to form an overall view of urban transit impact on energy consumption. Several option examples for conserving public and private transit energy are identified and evaluated for comparison purposes. Comments are included regarding other impacts con- cerning the optional examples selected. 730522. (SP-383) Criteria for Evaluating Vehicle In-Use Inspection/Maintenance Impact on Emissions and Energy Conservation. John C. Elston, New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection. A generalized approach is taken looking at automobile emissions and energy problems from the vantagepoint of a state government regulatory agency. The auto industry's vast capability for technology, mass production, quality control, and marketing ability culminates at the dealer- ship. Thereafter, the vehicle is often viewed by the user much differently. Initially, this paper attempts to overlay many of the different disciplines that formulate the final product. By examining a wide range of environmental ills, in part created by the automobile, and by analyzing how the automotive industry has adapted to past crises, the impending emissions and energy questions are explored by using various economic, regulatory, and engine design trend indicators. Prospectives for analyzing these prob- lems are demonstrated. Subsequently, by narrowing the paper's objectives, some previous technical studies are used to show potential benefits in emissions and fuel savings by the inspec- tion/maintenance control strategy. Firsthand emission surveillance and service data are supplied, illustrating the effect of New Jersey's inspection program with emphasis on minimizing the impact to the motoring public. 147</page><page sequence="71">730523-730527 Maximum emission reduction yields of 10-12% are expected for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emis- sions. Also, an additional 0.33% fuel saving could be realized. In addition, due to the causal effects of this strategy, other conservation-oriented incentives become apparent. Finally, in a further narrowing of scope, concepts for estimating the individual motorist's rationale behind his value judgments through energy balancing are attempted. Only by viewing the individual motorist and the mech- anism in which he perceives his environment and automobile can a more systematic analysis of future automotive impacts be undertaken. 730523. (SP-383) We Care About You and the Car You Contrive. Sidney Howe, Conservation Founda- tion. This paper discusses the present automobile situation in the United States, in terms of environmental damage, excess weight and low fuel economy, and how the public is forced to deal with traffic. The paper stresses that the automotive engineering industry can alleviate some of the problems by designing and marketing smaller, more efficient cars and by being attuned to the effects of present-day automobiles. Several suggestions are made, including a miles-per-gallon tax and environmental stickers on new cars, next to price stickers. 730524. Dynamic Behavior of Recreational Vehicles Dur- ing Braking and Steering. G. B. Hickner, Au- tomotive Control Systems Group, Bendix Corp.; and J. G. Elliott, Research Lab., Bendix Corp. Several techniques have been used to assist in developing an understanding of handling problems associated with braking and steering maneuvers for combination vehicles. The techniques involve analyses of varying complexity including use of large scale computer models. They also include actual vehicle testing where test results are correlated with analytic results. Simplified analyses show that lack of brakes on trailers can cause greatly extended stopping distances when compared with basic tow vehicle or good trailer braking stopping distances. More detailed analyses also show areas of instability which exist for combination vehicles undergoing stopping and turning maneuvers. 730525. Evaluation of Vehicle Handling and Stability by Computer Simulation at the First State of Vehicle Planning. T. Okada, T. Takiguchi, M. Nishioka and G. Utsunomiya, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Japan). Computer simulation of three vehicle motions has been made possible over a range up to high lateral acceleration. These three motions are stationary circular turning motion, slalom motion, and straight-running motion (against disturbances) selected as fundamental motions for evaluating vehicle handling and stability. The math- ematical model is a nonlinear one with seven degrees of freedom and 63 design parameters. The validity of this model has been confirmed experimentally. As for slalom motion, critical slalom speed with pole interval used as a parameter has been obtained theoreti- cally. In the process, some of the slalom characteristics that are known experimentally and empirically have been substantiated by assuming driver's perception and phys- ical limits relative to steering. 1973 SA E Transactions 730526. A Computer Similation for Three-Dimensional Vehicle Dynamics. Frank H. Speckhart, Uni- versity of Tennessee. This paper describes a 14 degrees-of-freedom mathemat- ical model that was developed to analyze and predict the handling dynamics of a 4-wheel vehicle. The system of nonlinear equations was programmed and numerically solved on the digital computer where the inputs are Ackerman steer angle to front and/or rear wheels and driving or braking torques on any or all wheels. The equations of motion for the sprung and unsprung masses were derived using Lagrange's equation. Constraints were included in the equations, which forced the sprung mass to roll about an inclined center roll axis. The analysis also included nonlinear tire character- istics as well as suspension geometry and compliance parameters, such as roll steer, roll camber, auxiliary roll stiffness, and lateral force deflection steer. The results of computer simulations for J-turn maneuvers are compared with experimentally measured data for two different speeds and steering inputs. 730527. Cold-Rolled High-Strength Steels for Automotive Applications. J. Malcolm Gray, Molybdenum Corp. of America. The metallurgical possibilities for increasing the strength of cold-rolled sheet are briefly reviewed. Solid solution hardening, precipitation hardening, grain refinement, and dislocation substructure can be used to varying extents to strengthen partially or fully recrystallized sheets. Yield strengths ranging 45-100 ksi (310-690 MPa) and higher appear to be technically feasible, and steels with yield strengths up to 65 ksi (450 MPa) are close to commercial production. The average plastic strain ratios of the high-strength cold-rolled steels are somewhat higher (1.0-1.35) than for similar hot-rolled steels but still relatively poor when compared to low-strength aluminum killed deep drawing sheet. The forming limit curves and forming performance of cold-rolled sheet are similar to hot-rolled high-strength steels indicating that less severe part design, improved die design, improved lubrication and shop practice, and control of steel cleanliness and sulfide shape will be essential if the new steels are to be properly exploited in automobile parts. 1973 SA E Transactions 148</page><page sequence="72">730528. Dent Resistance of Cold-Rolled Low-Carbon Steel Sheet. T. E. Johnson, Jr. and W. O. Schaffnit, U. S. Steel Corp. The dent resistance of cold-rolled low-carbon steel sheets is shown to be proportional to the product of the yield strength and the square of the thickness. However, the yield strength value used in this relation must be the yield strength appropriate to the strain rate of the particular indentation process. The use of a yield strength value obtained in a slow-speed tension test, for example, can lead to an erroneous estimate of the dent resistance of a sheet for an indentation process in which the strain rate is many orders of magnitude higher, as is usually true in commercial denting situations. 1973 SA E Transactions 730529. Springback Analysis of Biaxially Stretched Pan- els. David G. Adams and Arthur S. Kasper, Chrysler Corp.; and George M. Kurajian, The University of Michigan - Dearborn. A methodology is presented for analyzing springback of biaxially stretched panels as found in automobile exterior body panels, thus permitting determination of draw die overcrown. Good correlation is shown between the computer generated theoretical predictions and experi- mental data. 1973 SA E Transactions 730530. Contribution of the Vehicle Population to At- mospheric Pollution. Clark E. Fegraus, Auto- motive Environmental Systems, Inc.; Charles J. Domke and James Marzen, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Office of Air Programs, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, sponsored in 1972 a study of emissions from light-duty vehicles in six cities to determine the contribution to atmospheric pollution by the vehicle population. AESi, under contract to EPA, performed comprehensive tests on 1020 vehicles of the 1957-1971 model years to determine levels of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (C02), and oxides of nitrogen (NOJ exhaust emissions. Vehicle exhaust emissions, as measured by the 1972 and 1975 Federal Test Procedure, were of similar magnitude among all cities except Denver, Colo. CO and HC effluents were signif- icantly higher at high altitude, but NOx were significantly lower. Emission results by manufacturers were relatively uniform. The 1968-1971 model year vehicles, which were subject to federal HC and CO exhaust emission controls, exhibited lower mean HC and CO levels than the 1957-1967 model year vehicles, although NOx levels were higher from the new, controlled vehicles. 730531. A Laboratory for 1975-1976 Vehicle Emission Testing. Arthur Brown and Norman Brainard, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. An exhaust emissions laboratory has been established where soak-and-test investigations can be performed in an 730528-730534 integrated, climate-controlled setting, in accordance with the 1975 Federal Test Procedure. Catalytic converter designs, catalyst materials, and other emissions-related engine and vehicle components are tested in this labo- ratory. The paper discusses the new facility's capacity for making converter modal efficiency measurements, and it provides details on the real-time data processing, as well as on the improved controls of test variability. The laboratory layout is described and illustrated, and infor- mation is furnished on data acquisition and reduction, facility calibration, and experience with a servo driver and with materials evaluation vehicles. Both an analog computer and a minicomputer are used in the laboratory, and the printout copy reproduced here includes a real-time modal data sheet, a test summary, and a data repeatability analysis. 730532. A Servo Vehicle Driver for EPA Emission Tests. A. Levijoki, J. Ayres, R. Yu and M. Hammel, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. An electronic servo controller, combined with an electric chassis dynamometer and a synchronized minicomputer generated command signal, provides consistent and smooth driving of development vehicles on EPA emission runs. The electronic controller provides the necessary signals to actuate the throttle servo to power the engine, and to generate braking torque on the chassis rolls of the electric dynamometer. The servo gain and compensation circuits allow accurate and stable operation over a wide range of engine loads, transmission gear ratios, and car speeds. A single gain-compensation network is sufficient for vehicles used in AC's catalytic converter development program. Safety shutdown circuits and ease of installation are provided in the design. 730533. Variables for Emission Test Data Analysis. William H. Holl, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. A comprehensive EPA emission test analysis program has been developed to determine the nature and relative significance of test variability and to provide consistent evaluation of the performance of catalytic converters. This includes real-time recordings of emission concentrations and mass rates, catalytic converter efficiencies, and air-fuel ratio. Mass accumulations are printed out during the test at the end of each test mode. Test results and analysis of repeatability are summarized on-site immedi- ately following the test. Simplified relationships between gas concentrations and engine variables have been developed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730534. Assurance and Control of Vehicle Emission Testing. M. L. Moore, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp.

Experimental design techniques are used in the test development activities to control test parameters and to insure sufficient test repeatability for test evaluation. 2. Test histories, established and automatically main- tained on computer files, are continuously monitored to assure test control and to provide insights into the effects of various test parameters. 3. The objectives of each specific test request are analyzed and experimental designs utilized to develop test plans and procedures. Illustrative examples in each area are included. 730535. Hydraulic Brake Actuation Systems under Con- sideration of Antilock Systems and Disc Brakes. Otto Depenheuer and Hans Strien, Alfred Teves GmbH (Germany). Hydraulic power braking systems for use in passenger cars and light trucks are attracting considerable automotive design attention. This is due to their compactness, smaller space requirements, and better operating "feel," as well as their more direct control over the braking function, which has extremely short application and release times. More- over, they are readily adaptable to the energy source and controls of an antilock system, and they contribute to (or even form the basis of) a central power-supply system that would provide servo assistance to other vehicle systems. This paper describes and explains ways of creating these brake systems and gives design calculations of brake layouts based on standard values and comparative judgment criteria. 1973 SA E Transactions 730536. Hydraulics Offer Advantages in Power Brake Boosters. A. K. Brown, L. G. Bach and D. J. Baker, The Bendix Corp. The use of hydraulics offers a power brake system that provides the higher pressures required to meet the new Federal Safety Stopping Distance Regulations for pas- senger cars and truck applications up to 15,000 lb gvw. The design and operating characteristics of the Bendix Hydro-Boost hydraulic power brake booster are explain- ed. The ratio change feature of the design shortens the power stroke of the unit and multiplies the input motion at the valve, thus importing a responsive proportional feel to the brake. Also, the minimal interaction between steering and braking is an achievement made possible by the valve design employed. The system allows utilization of full pump relief pressure which enhances the response char- acteristics of the system because the power piston diameter can be held to a minimum. 1973 SA E Transactions 730537. Optimization of Nitrile Polymers and Nitrile Rubber Compounds to Obtain Maximum Heat Resistance. P. S. Byrne, D. C. Coulthard, D. C. Chalmers and J. J. Ridland, Polysar Ltd., Sarnia. The effects of nonpolymer constituents and antioxidants on the aging behavior of nitrile rubber polymers are discussed. The paper covers experimental work carried out to develop a range of rubbers which are responsive to heat resistant curing systems, the optimization of these systems in terms of antioxidant protection, and the practical use of this type of nitrile rubber in compounding to meet critical specifications. The authors conclude that nitrile rubber polymers produced according to the SP principle offer excellent heat resistance in a variety of curing systems. Further- more, such polymers have an advantage over nitrile polymers produced with stabilizers which function as efficient antioxidants, since this latter type of polymer can detract from aging resistance, depending on the curing system used. 730538. Ways to Obtain Optimum Heat Resistance in Polyacrylate Elastomers. N. F. Silver, Rubber Chemicals Dept., American Cyanamid Co. This paper reviews development work in optimizing the heat resistance of polyacrylate elastomers. An expansion of the range up to 400° F, from the present 325-350° F, is currently being explored with the evaluation of fillers, curing systems, and other compounding ingredients. Data are presented comparing soap-sulfur and ammonium-type curing systems, and also for different combinations of carbon black and reinforcing mineral fillers using a soap-sulfur curing system. 730539. Performance of Polyetber Elastomers in Ele- vated-Temperature Environments. R. D. Carrel, Hercules Inc. This paper presents the performance of epichlorohydrin homopolymer, the epichlorohydrin/ethylene oxide co- polymer, and a polypropylene oxide elastomer when subjected to various environments at elevated tempera- tures. Comparisons with other oil-resistant specialty elastomers before and after aging in air and oil are discussed. Low-temperature flexibility, elongation, and other properties are included, as well as permeability evaluations. The data demonstrate the improved per- formance of polyether elastomers for a service temper- ature range of -40 to +300°F, especially for under- the-hood applications. 730540. Properties of EPDM Compounded for Maximum Heat Resistance. P. H. Rowe and J. H. Sude- kum, B. F. Goodrich Chemical Co.; and K. C. Baranwal, B. F. Goodrich Co. Design changes in new model cars have resulted in higher under-the-hood temperatures. This has created a demand for rubber components that are more heat resistant. Since ethylene propylene terpolymer (EPDM) is a heat and weather resistant polymer being considered for many of these applications, this paper is presented to show the 150</page><page sequence="74">effect of various cure systems on heat resistance of EPDM compounds. The common sulfur cure system is useful to 300° F and the use of a sulfur donor system can extend that range to 350° F. Above 350° F a peroxide cure is shown to be necessary. 730541. Heat Resistance of Chlorosulfonated Polyeth- ylene and Polychloroprene. I. C. Dupuis, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. (Inc.). Elastomeric vulcanizates of chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSM) exhibit wide variations in heat resistance. Differ- ences also occur among polychloroprene (CR) vulcani- zates. These differences in heat resistance are related to compounding variables. For both CR and CSM, a minimum of polymer dilution with fillers and heat stable plasticizers is necessary. Other critical variables include the proper selection of metal oxides and antidegradants. Using an absolute elongation at break of 100% as the index or end-point of elastomeric utility, the best heat resistant CSM vulcanízate has approximately 28 °C (50° F) greater thermal stability than the best heat resistant CR vulcanízate. Heat resistant vulcanizates of CSM vary in thermal stability by 20-22°C (36-40°F), depending on their makeup. When air oven aged at constant temper- ature, differences of 3- to 5-fold in the time to reach 100% elongation are shown for CSM and for CR vulcanizates. 1973 SAE Transactions 730542. Physical Vapor Deposition - Present and Future. Art Anderson, Aireo Temescal Div., Aireo Inc. Recent advances in electron beam evaporation, using automated vacuum coating systems, are dramatically increasing the use of physical vapor deposition for both decorative and functional coating applications. Some examples of these applications are: 1. The use of new metals, including alloys, to provide improved corrosion and/or abrasion-resistant coatings for plastic substrates. 2. The use of new metals and oxides to provide new decorative effect. 3. The use of evaporated thick coatings of clear glass-like materials to protect thin metal coatings. 4. The use of evaporated thick coatings of clear glass-like materials to provide a hard surface on clear plastics used for glazing and opthalmic applications. 5. The use of evaporated copper as a strike-coating for subsequent chromium electroplating. 6. The use of multicomponent alloys to coat gas turbine engine vanes and blades to provide improved sulfidation and oxidation protection. 7. The use of evaporated metal compounds to provide a hard surface to cutting tools, dies, and softer metals like aluminum. 8. The production of free-standing metal foils and laminates. 730543. Coating by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). John M. Blocher, Jr., Battelle Columbus Labs. 730541-730545 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the deposition of solids by chemical reaction of gaseous feed materials, is older and more complex than vacuum coating. For a long time it remained a laboratory curiosity; however, in recent years, it has become firmly established in many areas of technology, and new applications are being found. CVD is a versatile process, yielding deposits of many metals, alloys, semimetals, oxides, carbides, nitrides, and borides, and it has several advantages, the greatest of which is superior throwing power. However, to use it effectively requires an understanding of such factors as the chemistry of the available coating reactions, the chemical and thermal stability of the substrate being coated, and the effects on mass transport of the various vapor flow patterns encountered in coating objects of simple to complex shape. The range of applicability of CVD is discussed with examples, and guidelines are given for successful coating. 1973 SA E Transactions 730544. Sputter Coating - Its Principles and Potential. John A. Thornton, Telic Corp. The sputter coating process is reviewed, with particular emphasis on applications in the mechanical sciences. In addition to principles and methods of d-c and RF sputtering, the techniques of reactive, bias, and getter sputtering are described. Special attention is given to the plasma discharge as it relates to the achievement of high deposition rates and large substrate areas. The current state of development of sputtering equipment is examined from the point of view of its influence on coating properties and applications to production. Future pros- pects are discussed. It is concluded that significant increases in both deposition rate and area of coverage can be expected for d-c sputtering systems operating with cylindrically symmetric geometries. Less spectacular improvements are projected for RF sputtering. 1973 SAE Transactions 730545. Ion Plating. Tālivaldis Spalvins, Lewis Research Center, NASA. Ion plating is a high-energy or plasma deposition method which essentially consists of sputtering and ion implan- tation (thermal evaporation with ionization). During ion plating, deposition is by ions as opposed to atoms. Ion plating has the two distinct characteristics of high throwing power and high kinetic energy. The high throwing power is responsible for coating complex geometrical surfaces with a uniform film without rotation. The high kinetic energy of the ion flux forms a graded interface; as a result a very adherent film is formed. Mechanical tests (tensile, fatigue, and friction) show a very strong adherence of the film and even an increase in mechanical properties such as tensile strength and fatigue life. 1973 SAE Transactions 151</page><page sequence="75">730546-730551 730546. Applications of Ion Plating. Gerald W. White, Endurex Corp. Ion plating is a desposition process whereby high energy ions of plating material are extracted from a plasma at high energy and applied as diffusion coatings to a negatively charged substrate. Ion plating is done in a vacuum and offers an extremely wide choice of material combinations and very fast deposition rates. Thick films of refractory compounds can be ion plated onto surfaces without changing the roughness or topography of the surface. Excellent throwing power offers uniform film thickness even with three-dimensional substrates. The economics of ion plating make it attractive both for decorative and functional applications. 730547. Sputtering and Ion Plating as Industrial Pro- cesses. Bernard C. Stupp, Hohman Plating &amp; Mfg., Inc. Ion plating and sputtering offer materials engineers versatile coating methods. Both processes use a controlled pressure chamber and vacuum equipment. Sputtering is essentially a line of sight deposition method. The coating material is partially ionized, following electrical lines of force, during ion plating, uniformly coating the substrate configuration. Both processes - their applications and advantages - are discussed. Although the processes are not economically competitive with electroplating or other conventional coating methods, the properties they provide may offset the costs. 730548. Brake and Clutch Emissions Generated During Vehicle Operation. Michael G. Jacko, Research Lab., Bendix Corp., Robert T. DuCharme, Automotive Control Systems Group, Bendix Corp.; and Joseph H. Somers, Environmental Protection Agency. In order to define the extent of gas and particulate emissions from automotive brakes (and clutches), a combination separation and storage collection system was devised. Unique emissions collectors for both disc and drum brakes and for a clutch were conceived, designed, and built as the main embodiment of this instrumentation. The hardware was installed on a vehicle which was then driven through various test cycles to determine the extent and type of brake emissions generated at low- and high-operating temperatures. Typical driving conditions such as the Detroit Traffic Test as well as more abusive driving conditions such as fade tests were included. Typical original equipment and aftermarket friction materials for both disc and drum brakes were used in the tests. Brake reliiies were made to simulate typical consumer-type practices. The brake emissions generated were removed from the various collectors and mass balances were performed. The particulates were processed and analyzed by a combination of optical and electron microscopy to ascertain the asbestos content and the asbestos particle size distribution in the wear debris. Comparisons of emissions from new and used friction materials, from disc and drum brakes, and from original equipment and aftermarket materials were made. Finally, an estimate was made of the total emission of asbestos by all of the vehicles in the country. On the average more than 99.7% of the asbestos is converted. The contribution to the atmosphere is 5060 lb or 3.2% of the total asbestos emission. 1973 SA E Transactions 730549. Asbestos Emissions from Brake Dynamometer Tests. A. E. Anderson, R. L. Gealer, R. C. McCune and J. W. Sprys, Scientific Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. Dynamometer tests of a production disc brake provided new information on asbestos fiber emissions during break-in, normal use, and high temperature use condi- tions. Both amibent air and brake cooling air were sampled isokinetically, using 0.45 /im filters. Examination of test and background filters required a clarification process to maximize fiber detectability, the use of transmission electron microscopy (at 40,000X) for detec- tion, and electron diffraction for positive identification of asbestos fibers. Most of the lining asbestos was found to be converted to a nonfibrous material by the high flash temperatures of the braking surface. Less than 0.02% of the lining wear was released as asbestos fibers. The concentration of asbestos fibers in the urban atmosphere, due to brake usage, was conservatively estimated at less than 0.07 X '0~9 g/m3. Based on this upper bound, the use of brakes was judged to be not significant as a source of atmospheric asbestos. 1973 SA E Transactions 730550. Automated Fuel Road Octane Ratings. B. D. Keller, L. T. Wright and I. Ginsburgh, Amoco Oil Co.; and H. E. Rueckel, Electronic Systems Design Co. An instrument has been developed for obtaining fuel antiknock ratings in cars by the Modified Borderline, the Modified Uniontown, or the E-15 Octane Number Requirement Technique. It gives ratings that are more precise than those obtained conventionally, and the raters need not be so highly skilled. When combined with an automated driver, data logger, and fueling system, it permits up to 64 fuels to be road rated in triplicate at both full-and part-throttle by a single operator in an eight-hour shift. Reproducibility is about 0.7 octane for full-throttle and 0.9 for part-throttle, compared with about 1 and 1 .5 octane, respectively, for conventional ratings. 1973 SA E Transactions 730551. Effect of Altitude on Octane Requirement - 1972 Cars. H. A. Bigley, Jr., Gulf Research &amp; Development Co., B. D. Keller, Amoco Oil Co.; and Tim Wusz, Union Oil Co. of California. The Coordinating Research Council (CRC) conducted a program during the summer of 1972 to determine the decrease in octane number requirement with altitude for 152</page><page sequence="76">current model cars. The study was made because the engines in these cars run hotter and leaner than earlier models, no information was available on altitude correc- tions for unleaded fuels, and no adjustment was planned for the so-called 91 octane gasolines in the symbol system being developed by ASTM/SAE. Maximum octane number requirements were determined on thirty-nine 1971-1972 model cars, six 1967-1970 model cars, and four light-duty military trucks at sea level, 2000, and 4000 ft on three series of full-boiling range fuels and primary reference fuels. Results indicate that the decrease in octane number requirement per inch of mercury decrease (approximately per 1000 ft) is about two units for 1971-1972 cars and 1.5 units for the 1967-1970 cars and the four military trucks. 1973 SA E Transactions 730552. Optimum Octane Number for Unleaded Gaso- line. T. O. Wagner and L. W. Russum, Amoco Oil Co. Current evidence indicates that cars manufactured after 1974 or 1975 will be required to operate on unleaded gasoline. To determine the level of octane quality justified when refineries are producing only unleaded gasoline, improvements in mileage attainable by using gasoline of higher octane number were compared to costs of raising octane number. Motorists' total gasoline costs per mile are lowest when the octane number of the unleaded gasoline pool is in the range of 85-87 Motor octane number. And, dividing the unleaded pool into at least two octane grades - one at 1 or 2 units above and one at 2 or 3 units below the pool value - maximizes car satisfaction for any given pool quality. 730553. Development of the Federal Urban Driving Schedule. Ronald E. Kruse and Thomas A. Hüls, Environmental Protection Agency. This paper reviews the development of the LA 4 road route, and discusses efforts directed toward development of a short repetitive dynamometer cycle based upon the road route. Also described are the instrumentation, methods, and selection process used to obtain a speed profile of a typical drive over the 12 mile long route. The methods used to shorten the speed profile to 7.5 miles, and to shorten the average trip length, while preserving trip description such as average speed, idle time, number of stops, etc., are explained. A measure of the correlation of emissions from vehicles driven over the EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) and over the full LA 4 driving schedule is provided. The UDDS is a speed-time trace consisting of 18 profiles separated by idle periods of 0-39 s duration. The schedule covers 7.46 miles in 1372 s for an average speed of 19.6 mph. 730554. Evolution of Federal Light-Duty Mass Emission Regulations. Thomas A. Hüls, Environmental Protection Agency. 730552-730556 This paper presents the development of the concept of emission testing on a mass basis and the establishment of emission baselines and standards. Data from tests run on several fleets to establish equivalency factors between average exhaust emissions when testing according to the 1970 (7-mode), 1972 (CVS-C), and the 1975 (CVS-CH) federal test procedures are listed. These data were used to establish the 1972, 1973-1974, 1975, and 1976 standard values. Tests were run on 30 precontrol vehicles by both the 7-mode and CVS-C procedures to derive the factors used to translate the 7-mode procedure baseline data into equivalent CVS-C procedure baseline data for precontrol vehicles. These values were used to establish the 1972- 1974 hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) light-duty vehicle standards. Similar tests were run on 138 1970 vehicles to establish standards for the CVS-C procedure that were equivalent to the 1970 standards using the 7-mode procedure. Tests were also conducted on 90 vehicles to derive factors relating emissions from the CVS-C and CVS-CH test procedures. The results of these two programs were used to establish the 1975 HC and CO standards. A baseline study was run on 245 1971 vehicles to determine the average oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission level for 1971 vehicles when testing according to the CVS-C procedure. These results were used to establish the 1973-1974 and 1976 NOx standard values. The 1975 NOx standard is equivalent to the 1973 standard. The NOx emission factor from the 90-vehicle fleet program to relate the CVS-C and CVS-CH proce- dures was used to derive the 1975 NOx standard. The paper includes the test data and a discussion of the rationale behind the derivation of the standards. 1973 SA E Transactions 730555. New Investigations of Exhaust Gas Emissions of Motor Vehicle Traffic. H. May and W. Müller, University Trier-Kaiserslautern (Germany); E. Plassmann, Technischer Überwachungs- Verein Rheinland e. V. (Germany); and F. J. Drey- haupt, Gesundheit und Soziales des Landes NRW (Germany). In the scope of efforts at air purification, a registration system has been developed on behalf of the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs of North-Rhine- Westfalia considering every kind of emission contributing to air pollution. The emissions of motor vehicle traffic, industry, small business, and domestic furnaces are registered. The system establishes data with regard to place, time, duration, quantity, type, condition, and temperature of the emissions. The present state of investigation regarding motor vehicle traffic is discussed in this paper for the area of Cologne, West Germany. 730556. Influence of Vehicle Driving Patterns on Local- ized Urban Emissions Sources. H. C. Watson, 153</page><page sequence="77">730557-730563 Imperial College of Science and Technology (England). This paper presents procedures for calculating the emis- sions of the population-average diesel- and gasoline-fueled vehicles in a range of operating modes. These procedures, together with a simple, but flexible, model of vehicle driving patterns, are used to show how changes in traffic flow and driving patterns can influence the vehicular source of emissions along urban roadways. The proce- dures are applied to predict emission rates in hypothetical traffic flows and in real traffic conditions as measured in central Edinburgh, Scotland, where the relative contri- butions of individual traffic groups to the vehicular emission sources have been assessed. 730557. An Engine Dynamometer System for the Meas- urement of Converter Performance. D. M. Herod, M. V. Nelson and W. M. Wang, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. A precisely controlled, stabilized internal combustion engine is used to generate exhaust gas with fixed emission composition (HC, CO, NOx, 02, C02), and exhaust temperature. A two-way valve in the exhaust duct switches this gas into a catalytic converter initially at room temperature. The transient warmup and steady-state conversion efficiencies are printed out along with strip charts of the exhaust gas concentrations out of the converter, and gas temperature into and out of the converter. The transient response is particularly important since vehicle emission is much higher during the first few minutes of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) driving schedule. Thus, this test is effective in predicting EPA performacne of the converter on a particular converter test vehicle. Actual experimental results cor- relate very well. The math model for generating the predicted normalized EPA results has been developed. 730558. Engine Dynamometers for the Testing of Catal- ytic Converter Durability. J. P. Casassa and D. G. Beyerlein, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp. This paper explains many factors of accelerated catalyst life testing. The testing is done with many objectives, one of which is catalyst screening. Dynamometer testing schedules are exlained through- out and show they are useful tools for datalyst screening (ranking) and for studying durability characteristics of materials for a given type of fuel. Certain correlations are shown in order to demonstrate the fact that the results from these dynomometer test schedules are indeed meaningful. Results indicate that the emissions measured com- pared well with the Federal Durability schedule. 730559. Cycle Simulation. E. H. Comfort, J. S. Howitt and J. W. MacBeth, Corning Glass Works. This report discusses the theoretical and experimental considerations, and math model results used to establish a simplified engine-dynamometer test for catalytic con- verters. Simulation results have been correlated with the EPA Federal Test Procedure (CVS-1) parameters. Work- ing curves are presented to allow the user to predict ultimate catalytic converter performance in grams/mile. Statistical correlation coefficients show predicted values and actual CVS-1 values to be highly correlated. A linear regression analysis demonstrates that the "cycle simulation" procedure described provides an excellent one-to-one guide to EPA Federal Test results. 730561. Comparison of Catalyst Substrates for Catalytic Converter Systems. John L. Harned and David L. Montgomery, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Emission engineers are currently evaluating several catalyst substrate designs, such as monoliths and beads, for use in automotive converters. One of their problems is to design converters that provide adequate control of the engine exhaust emissions but that do not significantly increase back pressure. In this paper, the design tradeoffs between pressure drop and conversion efficiency are examined for monolith, bead, Raschig ring, and wire mesh catalyst substrates. It is shown that monolith substrates provide the best flexibility when designing converters to satisfy vehicle installation space and engine back pressure requirements. Bead substrates have higher potential conversion efficiencies than monoliths but are less adaptable to vehicle space requirements. 1973 SA E Transactions 730562. Indoor Vehicle Braking Simulation: Correlation and Comparison with Road Testing. Jean Odier, Ferado, S. A. (France). The paper briefly reviews the principle of a dynamometer that permits laboratory simulation of the road behavior of an actual passenger car, under all conditions. Also presented are the results obtained with United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 105 on a pas- senger car making both road and simulator tests. These results show an excellent correlation with road testing. Furthermore, a comparison with road testing allows us to state that a better quality of testing is obtained with the simulator test bench. 730563. Brake Road Testing in the Laboratory. R. M. Oldershaw, A. F. Prestidge and R. C. Birkmyre, Automotive Products Co. Ltd. (England). The paper illustrates the high degree of correlation now attainable with practical vehicle test results, using a reduced-scale dynamometer. The techniques for achieving this state-of-the-art are described in relation to the parameters generally known to influence vehicle/labo- ratory correlation. As a result of the investigation, the following additional parameters are submitted: history of pad use, correct temperature/time simulation of the car by the machine, and rate of work input during a test. The simulation item is the subject of a special study in which 154</page><page sequence="78">the thermal conditions in a brake are examined on an analog computer by means of a 2 d.f. model. A discussion of the possible applications of the scale dynamometer leads to the conclusion that a machine could now be developed to provide meaningful data on linings for the use of friction material, brake, and vehicle manufacturers, as well as legislators. 1973 SAE Transactions 730564. Accelerated Fatigue-Testing Improvements - from Road to Laboratory. Don Hollinger and Arv Mueller, Chevrolet Motor Car Div., General Motors Corp. This paper describes a technique for programming accelerated laboratory fatigue tests which is called the "peak- valley-pair" (P-V-P) method. As presented, the P-V-P method applies to automotive structural compo- nents which are insensitive to frequency and subjected to unidirectional loading. The P-V-P algorithm operates on the measured service responses of the component (displacement, load, strain, etc.) to yield the control signal for a laboratory fatigue test. Associated data processing and an example of this methodology are also presented. 1973 SA E Transactions 730565. Shortcuts in Cumulative Damage Analysis. H. O. Fuchs, Drew V. Nelson, M. A. Burke and T. L. Toomay, Stanford University. The paper presents a method for shorter evaluation of the fatigue damage done by an irregular sequence of loads. The method looks first for the largest overall range from highest peak to lowest valley, then for the next largest overall range that interrupts the first range, and so on, down until a suitable fraction (for example, 10%) of all reversals have been used. These few reversals form a short history, which will do substantially the same damage as the total history. The process is applied to three long histories selected by the SAE Fatigue Design and Evaluation Committee. The sensitivity of calculated damage to the omission of smaller ranges is computed for plain and for notched specimens. The error is compared with differences produced by different current rules for evaluating damage, by different cycle counting methods, and by smooth specimen simulation of notched parts. 730566. Closed-Loop Exhaust Emission Control System with Electronic Fuel Injection. Richard Zech- nall, Guenther Baumann and Hermann Eisele, Robert Bosch, GmbH (Germany). The Federal Standards pertaining to the exhaust emission control of the 1976 model year automobiles presumably demand the catalytic conversion of the pollutants in- volved. Provided the air-fuel ratio is maintained at a stoichiometric value, some problems (for instance, fuel economy) can be solved. A closed-loop system was developed, consisting of an electronic fuel injection 730564-730568 system and a special oxygen sensor, called the X-sensor, in the exhaust manifold. First results on vehicles indicate that this control system offers a promising solution to the reduction of harmful contaminants. The closed-loop system can be used with a three-way catalytic converter or with a dual-bed system. It has not yet been investigated, whether the durability of the two systems is adequate, apart from the general problems of the durability of each catalyst. 730567. Nickel-Copper Alloy Nox Reduction Catalysts for Dual Catalyst Systems. L. S. Bernstein, R. J. Lang, R. S. Lunt and G. S. Musser, Esso Research and Engineering Co.; and R. J. Fedor, Gould Inc. Latest results with dual catalyst systems incorporating GEM nickel-copper alloy NOx reduction catalysts are reported. Progress in optimizing system design to provide: rapid warmup, maintenance of operating temperature, controlled carbure tion to maximize NOx removal, and minimize the risk of over-temperature, is discussed. Results of vehicle durability tests of GEM catalysts run on dynamometers are also presented. Rapid warmup of the catalyst system can be obtained by keeping NOx reduction catalyst mass low and making use of the ability of the reduction catalyst to oxidize CO, H2, and HC under net reducing conditions. This ability to oxidize CO, H2, and HC is also used to maintain system operating temperature. Carburetion is controlled to ±0.4 air-fuel ratio with a four-barrel, research carburetor, the design of which is described in detail. The research carburetor does not contain a power valve which helps minimize the risk of over-temperature, but an over- temperature safety or warning device will probably be necessary in the final system. Durability results presented in this paper show a significant improvement over the published state-of- the-art for NOx reduction catalysts. Discussion: D. M. Teague, Chrysler Corporation. 1973 SAE Transactions 730568. Catalytic NOx Reduction Studies. H. R. Jack- son, D. P. McArthur and H. D. Simpson, Union Oil Co. of California. Hundreds of catalysts have been evaluated in bench activity tests, using synthetic engine exhaust gas to determine conversion of NO to N2 and NH3. Many of these catalysts were also exposed to actual engine exhaust in an engine-dynamometer test, and then re-evaluated in the bench apparatus to determine the degree of catalyst deactivation. For catalysts prepared on nonreactive, hydrothermally stable support materials, it was found that the primary causes of deactivation were sulfur and lead poisoning. Subsequently, it was determined that deacti- vation of a NOx catalyst from sustained exposure to engine exhaust can be closely simulated by impregnating the fresh catalyst with lead acetate to the required lead level, followed by testing the catalyst with S02 present in 155</page><page sequence="79">730569-730573 the synthetic exhaust gas. These studies have resulted in the development of catalysts showing high initial NOx conversion efficiency and little deactivation in engine tests. 730569. Thermal Response and Emission Breakthrough of Platinum Monolithic Catalytic Converters. Charles R. Morgan, David W. Carlson and Sterling E. Voltz, Mobil Research and Devel- opment Corp. Stringent emission standards have strongly affected the requirement for catalysts and catalytic converters. Since considerable emphasis is placed on cold-start perform- ance, catalysts with lower density and higher oxidation activity at lower temperatures are required. Monolithic catalysts have been extensively evaluated in low-emission vehicles. This paper identifies the key phenomena asso- ciated with overtemperature and emission breakthrough problems in platinum monolithic converters. 1973 SA E Transactions 730570. Initial Oxidation Activity of Noble Metal Au- tomotive Exhaust Catalysts. Gerald J. Barnes and Richard L. Klimisch, Research Laborato- ries, General Motors Corp. The use of relatively small catalytic converters containing alumina-supported platinum (Pt) and Palladium (Pd) catalysts to control exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) was investigated in full-scale vehicle tests. Catalytic converters containing 70-80 in3 of fresh catalyst were installed at two converter locations on the vehicle. Carburetion was richer than stoichiometric, with air-fuel ratios (A/F) comparable to those proposed for dual-catalyst systems containing an NOx reduction catalyst. The vehicle was equipped with exhaust manifold air injection. Homogeneous thermal reaction in the exhaust manifolds played a significant role in the overall control of HC and CO. Four Pt catalysts, three Pd catalysts, and one Pt-Pd catalyst were prepared and evaluated. Total metal load- ings were varied 0.01-0.07 troy oz. Hydrocarbon conversion efficiencies varied 62-82%, measured over the 1975 cold-hot start weighted Federal Test Procedure. Corresponding CO conversions ranged 89-97%. Catalyst performance was best in the front converter location which produced higher bed tempera- tures. This performance difference was almost exclusively due to the effect of converter location on warmup emissions. There were no large differences in the emission control capabilities of Pt versus Pd catalysts. These metals had equal initial oxidation activity. In this vehicle, it appeared that 0.04 troy oz of either Pt or Pd gave sufficient initial oxidation activity to reduce HC and CO emissions to the desired 1975-1976 federal emission limits.

Unlike lithium chloride, chemical, and other surface-type elements, the Brady Array exhibits bulk effects conform- ing to the Poole-Frenkel law concerning bulk phenomena. Other types of sensors require agglomeration of water or moisture prior to measurement; in the array, measure- ments are accomplished at a discrete molecular level, resulting in extremely rapid response and recovery times (better than 150 ms). Stressed bonds within the structure initiate rapid recovery by purging the sensor when it is moved from higher to lower values of relative humidity. The sensing element is contained within a TO-5 type transistor housing, measuring only 10 mil in diameter and 100 mil in length. The array has been operated over temperature ex- tremes ranging -200 to + 800° F without damage or loss of calibration. The technique employed in the array also lends itself to sensing of other gases, when constructed using techniques proprietary to Thunder Scientific Corp. In- house development is in progress on array-type sensors of the major pollutants, such as CO, C02, N02, etc. 730572. Semiconductor Sensors for Automotive Instru- mentation. K. N. Sundaram, I. C. Transducers, Inc. Piezoresistive phenomena found in silicon semiconductors and the possibility it has of integrating various electronic functions (all in one family of technology) are a viable method of meeting the future requirements of the automotive industry. After a brief discussion of the evolution of semiconductor sensors and the state-of- the-art design, the author proceeds to propose some suitable circuits for integration of electronic functions such as comparator, amplifier, A to D converter, etc. Although the discussion centers on pressure transducer design, the facts in the example can easily be transferred to temperature, flow, and acceleration measurements. 730573. Automotive Powerplant Transducers - Fact or Fiction? H. R. Mitchell and R. N. McGill, Research Laboratories, General Motors Corp. Most transducers offered commercially are suitable for laboratory, aerospace, or industrial process applications but do not meet additional, stringent automotive re- quirements. A need exists, both present and future, for various types of transducers in automotive powerplant control systems. Possible electronic systems and sub- systems requiring transducers are discussed, and the types of transducers needed for these systems are described along with a discussion of a general set of specifications with respect to accuracy, reliability, and durability. Substantial transducer development is needed to enhance the advancement of certain automotive electronic systems. This paper points out these requirements to the electronics 156</page><page sequence="80">industry in an effort to encourage a mutual industry development that will advance the technology. 1973 SA E Transactions 730574. Precision Vacuum Pressure Transducers at Low Cost. Don Payne, Guitón Industries, Inc. The requirements of aerospace programs have brought about refinements in the fabrication of small precision pressure transducers in recent years. This paper describes the Guitón Model GS-1 pressure transducer, which was designed primarily for installation on automobiles. Con- siderations in its development were: corrosive or solvent characteristics of the pressure media commonly encoun- tered in the automobile engine compartment; vibration and shock levels; electromagnetic interference con- straints; temperature variations; calendar and cycle life; electrical power available; size and weight; mounting, including pneumatic and electrical connection; and cost. Design details for satisfying these considerations are discussed. 730575. Sensor for On-Vehicle Detection of Engine Exhaust Gas Composition. William J. Fleming, David S. Howarth and David S. Eddy, Research Laboratories, General Motors Corp. Various proposals for emissions cleanup systems have shown the desirability of regulating engine air-fuel ratio within precise limits. For this purpose a prototype exhaust sensor has been investigated. The sensor is a ceramic device, made of stabilized zirconia, which operates via electrochemical principles. It is placed directly in the exhaust stream and generates a voltage signal which is an approximate indication of engine air-fuel ratio. Several sensors have been installed in situ on engines operated under controlled dynamometer conditions. Fundamental response characteristics of the sensors have been determined. The results of this investigation, together with descriptions of the construction and installation configuration of the prototype sensor, are discussed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730576. Transducers for Engine Management. M. M. Bertioli, Group Research Centre, Joseph Lucas Ltd. (England). The particular difficulties encountered in designing fuel and ignition controls in today's automobiles have led to consideration of electronic systems. These are totally dependant upon the transducers used to provide the information they require, and frequently the success of a given system depends upon the solution of some trans- ducer problem. This paper discusses some of the alter- native choices of input parameters to a control system intended to manage the fuel and ignition of an internal combustion engine. The requirements for, and designs for, transducers to measure throttle angle, crankshaft speed and position, air mass flow, engine component position, and exhaust quality are discussed. 730574-730580 730577. A Solid-State Strain Gage Vacuum Sensor. Robert L. Cheney, Electronics and Instruments Group, Bell &amp; Howell Co. This paper describes a diffused semiconductor strain gage pressure transducer designed for use as a manifold vacuum sensor in electronic ignition and electronic fuel injection systems. The design philosophy, construction, and the cali- bration techniques used to enable the subject transducer to perform accurately over a broad range of environments and maintain this performance for thousands of miles without periodic recalibration, are discussed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730578. Techniques and Equipment for Axial Fatigue Testing of Sheet Steel. G. M. Marsh, Dominion Foundries and Steel Ltd. (Canada); A. D. Robb and T. H. Topper, University of Waterloo (Canada). The techniques and equipment discussed in this paper were developed in order to characterize the fatigue behavior of sheet steels ranging in thickness from 0.10-0.20 in. The unique developments consist of a specimen gripping and alignment device, and an inex- pensive, highly sensitive diametral extensometer. Test results indicate that the combination of specimen geometry and specially designed grips performed satis- factorily, and that longitudinal and diametral specimens are satisfactory for strain amplitudes up to 0.75 and 7%, respectively. The techniques could be used to obtain axial fatigue data on sheet steel as thin as 0.100 in. 730579. Failure Analysis of a Shot-Peened Component. Om Johari, ITT Research Institute; and William A. Sipes, Naval Air Development Center. A comprehensive scanning electron microscope (SEM) survey of the fracture surfaces of an aircraft main landing gear shock strut piston showed that improper shot peening contributed to the initiation of the anamolous fatigue failure. SEM photographs of the suspect-origin regions and the surrounding areas were analyzed. The photographs are presented, along with a detailed description of the regions observed. Failure mechanism is discussed, and causes of fracture origin explored. 730580. The Role of Surface Finish in Pitting Fatigue of Carburized Steel. J. P. Sheehan, Packer Engi- neering Associates; and M. A. H. Howes, IIT Research Institute. An investigation of the influence of surface roughness of lubricated rolling-sliding contact surfaces on pitting fatigue has been carried out. A significant increase in pitting resistance resulted from polishing the ground mating surfaces. When the roughness of the loading rollers (positive slip element) was reduced from 10-15 to 5-9 /xin rms and that of the test specimen (negative slip element) from 10 to 2-3 /iin rms, there was a gain of about 150% in 157</page><page sequence="81">730582-730587 load-carrying capacity before pitting occurred. The surface roughness of the loading roller appears to be the dominating factor. The degree of metallic contact and surface distress decreases when the roughness of the roller approaches the thickness of the oil film. 1973 SAE Transactions 730582. The Calspan Tire Research Facility: Design, Development and Initial Test Results. K. D. Bird and J. F. Martin, Calspan Corp. A new tire research facility (TIRF) has been developed which uses appropriately surfaced steel belts to provide high-speed flat simulated roadway surfaces for measuring the forces and moments generated by pneumatic tires at various operating attitudes, loads and speeds. Descriptions of TIRF and several of its important features are presented. These include the method of support of the moving roadway beneath the tire contact patch, the method of maintaining belt tracking under high side loads, the balance system used to measure forces and moments, and the computer control system used to operate and control the machine and completely process the data. Machine performance specifications and typical data are included. 1973 SAE Transactions 730583. Nondestructive Tire Inspection Studies at the Transportation Systems Center. I. Li tant, Trans- portation Systems Center, U.S. Dept. of Trans- portation. A program is underway at the DOT/Transportation Systems Center to study the nondestructive detection of defects in tires, and to determine the relationship between these defects and tire failure. Ultrasonics, x-ray, infrared, holography, and other techniques are being used to determine their effectiveness as well as their limitations in this task. This paper describes the use and modification of the equipment for nondestructive inspection of new and retreaded tires. It also describes the use of a computer data bank for data collection, storage, and retrieval in the correlation of results. 730584. Detection of Defects in Accidents. James O'Day and William L. Carlson, Highway Safety Re- search Institute, The University of Michigan. Several sets of both police-reported and in-depth traffic accident data are queried with respect to the involvement of vehicle malfunctions or defects in accident causation. It is concluded that accident-causing defects are inconsis- tently reported, are often attributable to the lack of appropriate maintenance practices, and are evidently not being corrected by present motor vehicle inspection systems. Although vehicle malfunctions are less frequently identified as accident causes than either human or environmental factors, they are noted often enough to be considered a problem. It is suggested that the automotive engineer has already built into the vehicle many detection systems which serve notice to the vehicle owner/operator that a component needs attention. Finally, it is suggested that further efforts in this direction may supplement state authorized periodic inspection programs in minimizing the incidence of vehicle defects in accidents. 1973 SAE Transactions 730585. Improved Automobiles Through Product Devel- opment. R. R. Love and C. W. Ewing, Engi- neering and Research Office, Chrysler Corp. This paper reviews the automobile development process, highlighting improvements that have been made. New model development is described first, followed by discussions of proving grounds testing and test facilities. Some of the product changes which have resulted from these processes are enumerated in the areas of corrosion protection, lubrication, electronics, customer comfort and convenience, tires and brakes, and safety and security. Finally, a product comparison is presented of a 1958 model automobile versus a 1973 model of a comparable automobile. 730586. Making the American Motors' Buyer Protection Plan Work. Richard M. Miller, American Mo- tors Corp. Increased emphasis upon achievement of customer sat- isfaction has forced American Motors' quality and reliability activities to develop new techniques for identi- fiying and correcting field product problems. This paper will describe the features of the American Motors' Buyer Protection Plan; will review methods used to provide product problem information feedback; and will discuss fleet performance reporting, new model dealer reaction surveys, warranty parts return programs, and specialized warranty analysis. The unique product problem and action status reporting procedure developed to provide a uniform coordinated method for investigation, recording and resolution of field quality problems will be presented. Sound communication and motivational techniques ex- ercised within the organization enable prompt reaction to implement the message of the Buyer Protection Plan. 730587. Fault-Tree Applications to the Automobile In- dustry. James Mateyka, Richard Danzeisen and David W. Weiss, Booz, Allen Applied Research. "Fault tree" is a name given to a logic diagram that develops all of the subsystem and component faults and combinations of faults which can result in particular system symptoms or faults. This type of logic diagram can be extremely useful in all phases of automobile design and service. Applications are discussed to the following areas: 1. As a reliability tool for identifying and cataloging specific problems, to preclude their being incorporated in new designs. 2. As a diagnostic aid to maintenance personnel in systematically screening potential vehicle performance problems. 158</page><page sequence="82">3. As an aid in assessing accident causation factors and the potential contribution of vehilce defects to accidents. Examples in each area are presented. Particular emphasis is placed on the value of such logic diagrams over conventional troubleshooting charts and manuals in aiding mechanics to pinpoint specific problems. Problems and pitfalls in developing such detailed logic diagrams and implementing the results in a field service envi- ronment are also discussed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730588. The Effect of Crashworthiness Parameter Vari- ation on ESV Weight. Richard E. Kazares, Advanced Systems Lab., AMF Inc. Improved vehicle safety and increased vehicle weight are closely related and critical parameters. The capability of analytically relating vehicle crashworthiness and weight variation is necessary in order to apply a systems engineering approach to the overall vehicle weight problem. This has been accomplished at AMF by the development and use of an on-line user-oriented computer program to obtain vehicle weight as a function of crashworthiness parameter variation. The results of a crashworthiness-weight tradeoff study performed for an optimized experimental safety vehicle (ESV) design are reported in this paper. The analytical model and computer program are presented and dis- cussed. 730589. On the Occupant Crash Protection System of the Nissan ESV. Teruo Maeda, Namio Irie and Shozo Sato, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). It is extremely difficult to assure the safety of small cars in an 80 km/h (50 mph) frontal collision with a fixed barrier. As solutions to this problem, we should not only secure occupant survival space in such a collision, but also control body crashworthiness for better operation of the occupant protection system. It is also required that the occupant protection system should display its best performance. This paper discusses the body construction and occupant protection system of the Nissan ESV, designed with a systematic approach and method of matching the body crashworthiness and the occupant protection system. 1973 SA E Transactions 730590. ESV Test Methodology and Results. Norman S. Stahler, National Highway Traffic Safety Ad- min., U.S. Dept. of Transportation; and Fred Arndt, Ultrasystems, Inc. Under the Experimental Safety Vehicle (ESV) Program authorized by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, AMF Inc. and Fairchild Industries developed the first ESVs under competitive contracts, while General Motors Corp. and Ford later developed ESVs under noncompetitive contracts. These contracts stated that ESV testing would be performed by an independent contractor. 730588-730593 This paper describes the ESV test program through the GM phase of testing as related to methodology, operating procedures, and results, and the role of Dynamic Science Division of Ultrasystems Inc. as test contractor. 1973 SA E Transactions 730591. Handling and Stability Volvo's Experimental Safety Car. Friedrich Jaksch, AB Volvo (Swed- en). Many parameters influence vehicle handling, but not all have the same importance to the road-holding charac- teristics of the vehicle. The weight distribution on the front and rear axles is one of the more important factors and can be influenced by the driver. For example, a fully loaded car may have a load of 40% on the front axle and 60% on the rear axle. This unbalanced distribution can cause problems for the driver in transient steering. It is important, therefore, that vehicles be designed so that even the worst weight distribution will not affect handling qualities to the extent that the driver has difficulty in controlling the steering. That is, handling performance should vary as little as possible regardless of dispropor- tionate load distributions. 1973 SA E Transactions 730592. Durability of Monolithic Auto Exhaust Oxidation Catalysts in the Absence of Poisons. K. Ay kan, W. A. Mannion, J. J. Mooney and R. D. Hoyer, Engelhard Minerals &amp; Chemicals Corp. A study was undertaken to determine the thermal stability, in the absence of poisons, of a PTX-Type IIB monolithic oxidation catalyst and to demonstrate dura- bility on a vehicle by actual road testing. Effective control of emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide for 50,000 miles was achieved in the absence of system or engine malfunctions. No increase in carbon monoxide emission and a gradual increase in hydrocarbon emission was seen over this period. The increase in hydrocarbon emission was compared to that observed for a series of catalysts, hydro-thermally aged in the laboratory, indi- cating that the gradual increase was due primarily to thermal effects. An analysis of the lead distribution in lead-free gasoline was made, indicating that with 0.05 g/gal maximum lead level (per EPA regulations) less than 0.03 g/gal would be valid for certification of automobiles. 730593. Fuel Effects on Oxidation Catalysts and Cata- lyst-Equipped Vehicles. A. H. Neal, E. E. Wigg and E. L. Holt, Esso Research and Engineering Co. The effects of lead and sulfur in gasoline on the activity of two platinum oxidation catalysts have been studied using engine dynamometer units. Under the steady-state con- ditions used, no poisoning due to sulfur was observed. Prolonged operations with lead up to 0.07 g/gal reduced the hydrocarbon conversion activity of the catalysts in proportion to time and lead concentration, but did not 159</page><page sequence="83">730594-730597 affect CO conversions. The overall extent of lead poi- soning was relatively minor, however. Catalysts exposed to the equivalent of 25,000 miles operation with a fuel containing 0.07 g/gal lead still met the original 1975 federal emissions standards of 3.4 g/mile CO and 0.41 g/mile HC when tested on an experimental vehicle. Exposure of platinum catalysts to exhaust from 20 gal of fuel containing 0.5 g/gal lead caused an immediate drop in catalyst activity, but this loss was rapidly recovered when operations continued with a lead-free fuel. Thus, short-term contamination of catalyst-equipped cars with lead may not be the serious problem it was formerly thought to be. Several 1973 model vehicles have been converted by the addition of experimental oxidation catalyst systems and addition of experimental oxidation catalyst systems and used to determine the effects of fuel gravity and volatility on emissions and performance. These catalyst- equipped cars gave driveability and fuel economy at least as good as the corresponding 1973 vehicles to the extent tested. Fuel volatility and gravity did not significantly affect hydrocarbon and CO emissions, for these systems, at an ambient temperature of 70° F using the 1975 federal test procedure. 1973 SA E Transactions 730594. Study of the Deactivation of Base Metal Oxide Oxidation Catalyst for Vehicle Emission Control. E. C. Su and E. E. Weaver, Ford Motor Co. A study was made of the deactivation of a pelletized base metal oxide catalyst which was evaluated in an eight-car fleet for accumulation of up to 18,000 miles in customer- type driving. The fleet test was carried out to determine the effects of two converter locations and four tetraethyl lead levels (0.06-3.17 g/gal) in the fuel on the effectiveness of the catalyst for the control of CO and HC emissions. Samples of the used catalysts were examined to ascertain the changes in BET surface area, size distribution and chemical composition of the contaminants deposited on the catalyst, and the patterns of penetration of lead contaminant. The major changes found in the used catalyst samples were correlated with the activity data obtained by the catalyst manufacturer on duplicate catalyst samples. The amount of lead deposits found on the catalyst represented about 50% of the lead in the fuel based on an assumed gas mileage of 17 mpg, and was nearly in direct proportion to the lead content in the fuel and independent of converter location. The catalyst activity for CO and HC oxidation was adversely affected by the accumulation of lead deposits. The major effect due to the converter locations investigated in this study was found in the loss in the catalyst BET surface area. Catalyst samples from front- mounted converters suffered a greater loss of surface area, but a nearly twofold variation in catalyst surface area (50 versus 100 m2/g) had a relatively small effect on the HD oxidation activity. 730595. The Effect of Lead, Sulfur, and Phosphorus on the Deterioration of Two Oxidizing Bead-Type Catalysts. Roy A. Giacomazzi and Max F. Homfeld, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Catalyst durability tests were run to gain additional information on the effects of contaminants on catalyst deterioration. Six different fuels were used with two oxidizing bead catalysts - platinum and palladium. In addition, a special oil was evaluated with both catalysts. Both catalysts showed deterioration with miles, but the platinum catalyst had least deterioration. Increasing lead in fuel increased deterioration. Increasing sulfur did not. Phosphorus, however, was harmful, more so with the platinum catalyst than the palladium. 1973 SA E Transactions 730596. Fuel Lead and Sulfur Effects on Aging of Exhaust Emission Control Catalysts. S. S. Hetrick and F. J. Hills, Mobil Research and Development Corp. Promising CO/HC exhaust emission control catalysts for 1975 applications, including noble and base metals on pelleted and monolithic supports, have been aged 12,000 miles in engine dynamometer operation using a multitube converter. The engine was operated over a modified AMA durability cycle on the same base fuel containing different amounts of trace lead (0.003-0.075 g/gal) and sulfur (0.004-0.10 wt. %). Catalysts were aged at two temper- atures, 1000 and 1350°F, and with two lubricants, with and without metallic additives. Catalyst activity determined in cold start bench tests indicates that, for noble metal monolithic and pelleted catalysts, the loss of CO and propylene conversion with aging is not significantly affected by differences in the fuel lead and sulfur contents studied. The ability of aged catalysts to convert propane, a hydrocarbon more difficult to oxidize than propylene, is degraded by higher fuel lead content at trace levels. In this aging facility, with the same fuel lead content, significantly smaller amounts of lead are accumulated on catalysts when they are aged at the lower temperatures. Therefore, exhaust system configuration and operating temperatures may appreciably alter the relationships between fuel contaminant concentrations and the degree of contamination of aged catalysts. 730597. Fuel and Lubricant Effects on Oxidizing Cata- lysts. R. J. McConnell and T. F. McDonnell, Ford Motor Co. The loss of efficiency of oxidizing catalysts, which probably will be required in the future to meet vehicle emission control standards, is of prime concern. An investigation of the loss of catalytic activity resulting from exposure to potential catalyst poisons has been made utilizing engine-dynamometer tests and vehicle field tests. Tentative results indicate that zinc, barium, calcium, and magnesium additives in oil and the sulfur level in fuel do not have an apparent effect on catalyst deterioration. Low 160</page><page sequence="84">Ievels of lead and phosphorus in fuel do have an apparent effect. SE engine oil A, B, and C have not shown significantly greater deterioration effects than the ashless oil. The investigation of the effects of fuels and engine oils on catalyst deterioration is being continued. 730598. Effects of Engine Oil Composition on the Activity of Exhaust Emissions Oxidation Catalysts. N. E. Gallopoulos, J. C. Summers and R. L. Klimisch, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Platinum, palladium, and copper-chromium oxidation catalysts for exhaust emission control were exposed to exhaust gases from a steady-state engine dynamometer test in which the amount of oil consumed per unit volume of catalyst was high. When unleaded gasoline (0.004 Pb g/gal, 0.004 P g/gal) was used, conventional SE oil caused somewhat greater loss of catalyst activity than an ashless and phosphorus-free ("clean") oil. Chemical analysis of the catalyst indicated that phosphorus from the conven- tional oil was probably responsible for the difference. However, a test run with low-lead (0.5 Pb g/gal, 0.004 P g/gal) gasoline and "clean" oil caused much greater catalyst activity deterioration than either of the tests with unleaded gasoline. The findings of this study indicate that engine oil effects on catalyst durability are of secondary practical importance, and that conventional SE engine oils will probably be acceptable for cars equipped with catalytic converters for the oxidation of exhaust hydro- carbons and carbon monoxide. 1973 SAE Transactions 730599. Shell Kraton G Thermoplastic Rubber. Lee E. Gunnerson, Shell Chemical Co. This paper outlines the chemical and physical properties of Kraton G compounds, a three-block polymer. The properties of the new product include excellent ozone resistance, good ultraviolet resistance, a broad range of service temperatures, excellent oxidative stability, and good compression set. The advantages offered include a more rubbery quality at -20° F, easier processing, easier painting, and greater heat stability. The compound is applicable to exterior decorative impact resistance parts, soft interior decorative parts, and general molded and mechanical parts of automotive vehicles. 730600. TPR Thermoplastic Rubber. John R. Johnson and Harris L. Morris, Uniroyal Chemical Div. Uniroyal, Inc. A new family of thermoplastic rubbers with potential in a wide variety of automotive applications has been develop- ed by Uniroyal Chemical which can be injection molded or extruded on conventional thermoplastic equipment into finished parts having the properties of vulcanized rubber. Salient features of TPR thermoplastic rubbers include fast molding cycles, reprocessability of scrap, exception- ally wide service temperature range (-60 to 300° F), excellent environmental resistance, excellent colorability via painting or color concentrates, inherently slow 730598-730604 burning, excellent electrical properties, excellent chemical resistance, and low elongation and compression set properties. The basic polymer properties and processing char- acteristics of TPR which are significant in determining automotive areas of applicability are presented. Potential automotive applications include exterior "soft" front and rear-end components, grommets, gaskets, bushings, seals, weatherstripping, and "soft trim". Comparison of TPR versus other flexible materials is discussed. 730602. Thermoplastic Polyurethane Elastomers Temper- ature Dependence of Physical Properties. F. E. Critchfield, J. V. Koleske and C. G. Seefried, Jr., Union Carbide Corp. Thermoplastic urethanes can be regarded as linear, block copolymers of the (AB)n type, the A block being considered the soft segment and the B block the hard segment. This study was concerned with the temperature dependence of mechanical properties for thermoplastic urethanes based on polycaprolactone diols, 4,4-diphenyl- methane diisocyanate (MDI) and 1,4-butanediol (BDO). The molecular weight of the polycaprolactone diol (A or soft segment) was varied independently, as was the relative concentration of the MDI/BDO hard (B) seg- ment. The resulting urethanes ranged from rubbery to hard and tough materials. Some of the urethanes displayed compatible behavior. Others displayed an incompatible behavior and were, thus, less temperature dependent. 730603. Improved Mechanical Restraints for Front Seat Compact Car Occupants. D. Friedman, Minicars, Inc. This paper is a summation of various efforts to develop and improve passive restraints (air bags) for front-seat compact car occupants. The results of 140 system sled tests and of two full-scale crash tests with the system are presented. Several tests were conducted with offset and obliquely positioned occupants. Numerous other tests were also conducted to compare the 5th percentile female with the 50th and 95th percentile male. 730604. Interaction Dynamics of an Inflating Air Bag and a Standing Child. Hai Wu, Sing C. Tang and Robert C. Petrof, Scientific Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents an analytical treatment of a me- chanical-mathematical model of an air bag inflation process integrated with a model for the interaction between the air bag and a standing child dummy. The inflation model consists of a one-dimensional gas dynam- ics analysis of the flow system which delivers the gas to inflate the bag. The interaction model then provides a method for calculating the forces exerted by the inflating bag on the standing child. The results show that the 161</page><page sequence="85">730605-730613 unacceptably high contact forces recorded in standing- child air bag tests are due to impact of the unopened portion of the bag on the standing child. A single- membrane concept is thus suggested to reduce this impact severity. 730605. General Motors Driver Air Cushion Restraint System. T. N. Louckes, Oldsmobile Div., Gen- eral Motors Corp., R. J. Slifka, Delco Elec- tronics Div., General Motors Corp., T. C. Powell, Saginaw Steering Gear Div., General Motors Corp.; and S. G. Dunford, Inland Manufacturing Div., General Motors Corp. This paper describes the Oldsmobile driver air-cushion restraint system designed to meet the new federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208. Described is the overall system, indicating how the components must function together to provide optimum vehicle barrier performance. Also included are discussions of the sensor system, the new steering column and mounting system, and the steering wheel and wheel-mounted air-cushion restraint module. 1973 SAE Transactions 730606. (SP-381) Field of View from Automotive Vehi- cles. Lyman Forbes, Eugene Färber, Thomas F. Swigart and Daniel D. Jack, Ford Motor Co. This report presents the findings of Ford Motor Co. research on fields of view 360 deg around automotive vehicles. The research considered forward, side, and rear fields of view from forward-moving vehicles. Rear vision through mirror systems was included. No attempt, however, was made to define the fields of view of drivers who look to the rear through windows without the use of mirrors. The analysis of direct vision to the rear and backing maneuvers must be deferred until more is known about the eye locations of drivers when looking directly to the rear. The research results presented in this report are described and illustrated for passenger cars. Technical issues and assumptions peculiar to vehicles other than passenger cars (that is, light trucks, MPV's, heavy trucks and buses) are treated in a separate section. Two- wheeled vehicles, off-road vehicles and specialized construction equipment are not considered. General descriptions of the driver's vision fields are given in the summary. Detailed presentations and explanations are given in the body of the report. Background material is provided in the Technical Notes. 730610. (SP-381) Methods of Application - Field of View Targets. D. Maurer and D. Fawcett, Ford Motor Co. The use of a new tool for the evaluation of driver visibility requirements is described. The tool takes the form of a program written for an interactive computer graphics systems. XYZ coordinates of window openings, visual obstructions, mirror systems and driver eye points are supplied as data. Polar coordinate line drawings are then generated on the graphics display simulating what a driver would see directly to the front and sides or indirectly to the rear through a rear view mirror. The program can be used to evaluate driver visibility in terms of forward and rearward visibility target areas in actual vehicles or in vehicle concepts (clay models, prototypes and car body drawings) which are sufficiently well developed to permit the specification of window coordinates. 730611. Identification of Symbols for Motor Vehicle Controls. Detlef Frank, Norbert Koenig and Reinhard Lendholt, Research and Development, Volks wagen werk AG (Germany). Clear identification of motor vehicle controls is necessary for safe operation of a vehicle. Identification of some well-known symbols and some new symbols was inves- tigated by a questionnaire. Differences in identification between trained and untrained subjects are shown (employees of a vehicle manufacturer versus factor visitors). Influences of sex, age, and professional educa- tion are evaluated. Recommendations for use and further development of symbols such as color and contrast, location, and lighting are given. These findings are compared with the SAE Research Study on the Interpreta- bility of ISO Vehicle Control Symbols, published June 9, 1970. 1973 SAE Transactions 730612. Some Analytical Crashworthiness Studies of Automobile Front Structures. Rong-chung Shieh, Calspan Corp. This paper presents an analytical study of the crash- worthiness of automobile front structures. The unique features of the automobile structural crashworthiness which must be evaluated in a manner separate from that of other dynamic response problems are described. Using a computer program, studies were undertaken on a Model 2D2 automobile colliding with barriers at various speeds. Displacement and deceleration results correlated reason- ably well with full-scale tests. This analysis has generated interest in studies with a three-dimensional structure which are currently underway. 730613. Light Alloy Wheels - The GKN Approach. M. P. Jarrett, J. A. Thompson and W. D. Mendham, GKN Castings Ltd. (England). Light alloy wheels offer many advantages over steel wheels, particularly with regard to styling. A wheel, however, is a safety critical component and performs an arduous engineering function. The performance and safety of a wheel can be enhanced by casting in light alloy, a fact well known to racing car designers. To ensure that advantages of light alloy wheels are not marred by poor reliability requires scrupulous control of all aspects of production. GKN has evolved an approach that ensures this control by direct involvement at all stages of manufacture in its modern integrated-wheel facility. 162</page><page sequence="86">730615. New Concepts of Tire Wear Measurement and Analysis. Walter Bergman and Wendel B. Crum, Product Test Operations, Ford Motor Co. This paper gives a comprehensive analysis of tire tread wear utilizing new experimental and analytical techniques. An explanation of the mechanics of tread wear is postulated and related to tire traction. A differentiation between grip and friction is introduced as an important factor controlling wear and traction, and a quantitative definition and experimental technique for measuring road microtexture and its tread wear effectiveness is proposed. The paper introduces new concepts which provide a basis for quantitative determination of factors controlling tread wear and provide new methods for measuring and calculating tire force energy, road surface abrasivensss, tire wear energy, and severity. Good correlation between tread wear and measured values of tire force severity and tire wear severity are established. A potential method for predictions of tire tread wear on a computer is developed. 1973 SAE Transactions 730616. Gasolines for Low-Emission Vehicles. J. C. Ellis, 1973 SAE President. This paper considers the physical and chemical charac- teristics of gasolines that are important in providing the wide range of performance qualities required to achieve acceptable emissions levels without unduly sacrificing customer acceptibility. The impact of overly restrictive fuel specifications on the capability to supply such fuels in quantity and on their cost to the customer is also considered. It is concluded that the future fuel for passenger cars will be a blend of liquid hydrocarbons. Front-end volatiles will be limited by vapor-pressure control to minimize handling losses and to accommodate vapor recovery systems. The use of certain high boiling hydrocarbon constituents will be restricted to that degree required to provide optimum emissions control at lowest overall system cost. The use of lead alkyl antiknocks, and other components which are deleterious to catalysts, will be disallowed. In some geographic areas, control of gasoline olefinicity can be expected until today's uncontrolled cars are lost by attrition from the total population of vehicles. Aromatics contents will, in general, not increase much beyond today's levels. The fuels, which will evolve for the emission controlled reciprocating internal combustion engine, will accommodate any near-future alternate powerplant for passenger cars. Finally, gaseous fuels will be used increasingly by passenger car fleets and trucks in urban areas but will not be widely distributed for general use by the average motorist. 1973 SAE Transactions 730617. (SP-379) Automotive Steam Power - 1973. Arthur W. Gardiner, Tennessee Technological University. After a brief review of early steam car performance, the results of current research are summarized with emphasis 730615-730620 on problems such as emissions, safety, cold-start delay, freezing, and choice of working fluid, control systems and fuel consumption. It is concluded that a Rankine cycle powerplant can meet 1976 federal standards for emission. Alternate fluids for steam engines are discussed, but water is still competitive, as is the piston engine. 730618. (SP-379) An Introduction to the Vehicular Gas Turbine Engine. C. A. Amann, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Born nearly a quarter of a century ago, the movement toward commerical use of the gas turbine engine in automotive vehicles has slowly progressed to the point of imminence in certain heavy-duty applications. Recently, interest in light-duty application to the passenger car has been stimulated by concern over exhaust emissions. This paper serves as an introduction to the vehicular gas turbine engine. It traces the developmental history of the engine for automotive use, provides some insight into the characteristics of the engine components and their function in the complete powerplant, and finally touches upon some recent activities in the gas turbine field. As an educational device, treatment of these topics is intended to be too comprehensive for the casual reader, yet sufficiently elementary that the gas turbine specialist is not challenged. 1973 SAE Transactions 730619. (SP-379) Electric and Electric-Hybrid Cars - Evaluation and Comparison. Norman H. Beach- ley and Andrew A. Frank, University of Wis- consin. The electric car has many features that make it attractive for urban use. Currently, its principal shortcomings are its short range and poor efficiency for a realistic driving cycle. An electric hybrid car of advanced design, such as the University of Wisconsin model described here, can overcome the limitations of the all-electric car, while retaining most of its advantages, but only at the expense of greater complexity. More research and development is required before either version can be an adequate replacement for our present internal combustion engine cars. 730620. (SP-379) Comparative Analysis of Stirling and Other Combustion Engines. Stephen R. Davis and Naeim A. Henein, Wayne State University. The development of the Stirling engine has recently gained momentum because of technological advances as well as the need to explore alternative power systems for meeting environmental concerns. An overview of the Stirling engine principles, taking into account the ideal as well as the actual cycle, is presented. The analysis examines the various design aspects and the performance and emission characteristics. A comparison is made between the Stirling and other continuous and cyclic combustion engines, such as the gasoline, diesel, gas turbine, and steam engines. This includes recent designs 163</page><page sequence="87">730621-730626 for the Rankine cycle and gas turbine combustors being considered for automotive applications. 730621. (SP-379) There's a Flywheel in Your Future? Louis J. Lawson, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., Inc. The need for new urban vehicle propulsion alternatives has been spurred by the growing concern in our cities over photochemical smog, smoke, odor, and noise, which are to a large degree the products of present vehicle powerplants. The incorporation of practical energy-storage elements into vehicle drives offers the potential of significant reduction of objectionable vehicle emissions. The recent "rediscovery" of the kinetic energy flywheel as a highly effective energy-storage system provides several new candidate propulsion systems either in heat engine/fly- wheel hydrid- or pure flywheel-drive configurations. 730622. (SP-378) An Airline Appraisal of Tubing System Problems. George F. Moore, Trans World Airlines, Inc. Maintaining the integrity of a hydraulic fluid distribution system in the commercial jet transport airplanes during routine operational service offers a major challenge to the airlines. The new 747, DC-10 and L1011 wide-body jet aircraft designs include significant trends that are intend- ed to improve the operational performance and reliability of these systems. Achievement of these objectives will depend to a great extent on the adequacy of consideration given to the subsequent maintenance and repair proce- dures as a part of the original design and the installation practices. Factors such as environmental conditions, accessibility, personnel familiarization, tooling and parts availability and their quality assurance associated costs and evolutionary design changes are recommended for thorough consideration by the designer to achieve an optimum degree of maintainability in the aircraft fluid distribution system. 730623. (SP-378) The Application of Armco 21-6-9 Steel Tubing to the DC-10 Hydraulic System. N. F. Robinson, McDonnell Douglas Corp. The Hydraulic Piping System of the DC-10 Airplane represents a break with the Military Standard tubes and fittings used for the previous quarter century. This paper summarizes the reasons for the selection of ARMCO 21-6-9 stainless steel tubing over several other candidate materials. Factors of weight, cost, availability and reliability were important, as well as compatibility with the various joining processes contemplated. Perhaps even more important were ease of fabrication of tube segments and assemblies, installation, and field repair. The Mc- Donnell Douglas material specification is summarized, with emphasis on tube inspection requirements. The tubing is giving excellent service, and was introduced into production with relatively few problems. 730624. (SP-378) Permissible Defects in Hydraulic Tub- ing. Hans van der Velden, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. Test methods and data are summarized to assist in establishing limits for defects in aircraft hydraulic tubing. The defects evaluated are (1) cracks as detectable by ultrasonic inspection after tube fabrication, and (2) service damage such as chafing and denting observed on aircraft. Permissible defect limits are listed for 606 1T6 aluminum return lines, 3000 psi hydraulic tubing of 21Cr-6Ni-9Mn as well as 304 1/8 hard CRES, and 3A1-2.5V cold worked titanium. The performance requirements are outlined to which the defect samples were tested. 730625. (SP-378) Defects in High Quality Aircraft Tub- ing and Inspection Methods. W. H. Braun, Whittaker Corp. The principal metals and alloys used for aircraft and aerospace tubing applications are 21-6-9, Type 304 stainless to MIL-T-6845 and commercially pure and alloyed (3A1-2.5V) titanium. Specifications covering this tubing require high quality with very tight defect levels. Very careful workmanship in processing and rigid in- spection practices must be followed in order to meet the requirements. Many kinds of defects can befall the tubing during processing. Some of these are common to all grades of tubing, while others are peculiar to individual alloys. Welded tubing is subject to more defects than seamless. Tubing in general is subject to more defects than almost any other kind of wrought steel product. Inspection practices include every kind of destructive and nondestructive tests applicable to tubing. Each test has certain capabilities and limitations. A combination of tests is required to give best assurance for critical applications. 730626. (SP-378) Quality Requirements for TÍ-3A1-2.5V Annealed and Cold Worked Hydraulic Tubing. C. J. Shaver, Grumman Aerospace Corp. This paper presents the author's view of the items Grumman Aerospace considers the controlling factors in obtaining a high quality aircraft hydraulic fluid trans- mission system utilizing titanium alloy TÍ-3A1-2.5V tub- ing. The discussion is divided into three separate areas of consideration. Tube length production is discussed in light of those processes or procedures which effect quality, and the test methods required to detect flaws. Tube shop tooling requirements are presented which are essential to the maintenance of the strength and quality levels imparted by the tube producer. Included is a theoretical description of the effects of ovality on impulse fatigue life. The third area considered describes the requirements for assembly and installation of the fluid transmission system into the using vehicle. The attachment fittings used in the Grumman F-14A aircraft, and the reasons for their choice are described. 164</page><page sequence="88">In support of some areas of the discussion, actual test data is presented on the degrading effects of ovalization on the impulse fatigue life of TÍ-3A1-2.5V tubing. Data is also presented showing an increase in impulse fatigue life with increasing overpressurization. 730627. (SP-378) Production of Extruded Tube Hollows for Titanium 3A1-2.5V Hydraulic Tubing. E. F. Baroch, B. A. McClanahan and R. E. Curtis, Teledyne Wah Chang Albany Corp. The warm extrusion process is described as adapted to making TÍ-3A1-2.5V tube hollows to be reduced for high-quality aircraft hydraulic tubing. The advantages of this process over conventional hot extrusion appear to be sufficient to warrant further studies aimed at improved uniformity. Alloy segregation is noted in the forged extrusion billets which can be eliminated by heat treatment. It is presumed that this segregation is related to problems encountered in fabrication to tubing and has an effect on the variability of properties in the final tubing. An approach to the problem is suggested. 1973 SA E Transactions 730628. (SP-378) The Development and Control of Crystallographic Texture in 3A1-2.5V Titanium Alloy Tubing. T. W. Rees, Superior Tube Co. Crystallographic textures which develop in alpha titanium alloys as a result of cold reduction can cause significant anisotropy or directional properties in finished aircraft hydraulic line tubing. The directional properties can either enhance or detract from tubing fatigue life and formabil- ity depending on the type of texture built into the tube during manufacture. Previous work has shown that the texture associated with optimum tube properties is one for which the basal poles of the hexagonal cell are near perpendicular to the tube axis in the longitudinal section, and radial in the transverse section. This texture is developed by using high ratios of wall to diameter reduction during cold working. The text provides guideline data for controlling cold reduction schedules during tube making to produce an optimum texture in the final product. Both tube reducing and bench drawing are considered as cold working methods. A discussion of a relatively fast and simple method for measuring the anisotropy present in tubing is given as a preliminary step toward establishing a standard test which can be used in procurement specifications. 730629. (SP-378) The Effects of Crystallographic Texture on the Mechanical and Fracture Properties of TÌ-3A1-2.5V Hydraulic Tubing. William F. Spurr, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co.; and William E. Quist, Boeing Aerospace Co. The effects of crystallographic texture on the mechanical and fatigue properties of titanium alloy 3A1-2.5V seamless hydraulic tubing are presented. Theoretical as well as 730627-730632 experimental evidence has shown that burst strengths, formability, fracture toughness and fatigue strengths are improved if a crystallographic texture is developed such that the basal planes are oriented parallel to the tube surface. This radial texture is preferentially developed when during tube fabrication, the amount of wall reduction is high compared to tube diameter reduction. The various techniques that have been developed to experimentally determine the degree of texturing present in a particular tube are also outlined. Two techniques are currently being used to evaluate texturing in tubes: x-ray pole figure determination and strain ratio (R) measure- ments made from tube tensile tests. 1973 SA E Transactions 730630. (SP-378) Surface Conditioning of Titanium Alloy Tubing. W. W. Stephens, Zirconium Technology Corp. Surface conditioning plays a significant part in the production of titanium 3A1-2.5V tubing for use in aircraft hydraulic tubing. It can be performed both mechanically and chemically, for both inside and outside surfaces. The purpose of this surface conditioning is to produce a uniform surface with no remaining defects in size or geometry that will adversely affect the tubing perform- ance. Several tests are then run to ensure conformance to requirements. 730631. (SP-378) Application of the Hydrostatic Extru- sion Process Toward Production of 3A1-2.5V Titanium Alloy Hydraulic Tubing. Anthony C. Keathley, Princeton Metal Systems Corp. The subject matter for this paper deviates slightly from that of the SAE symposium, that is "Criteria for current and advanced aircraft hydraulic tubing." Rather, this paper introduces an entirely new concept for manufacture of hydraulic tubing to satisfy the criteria, with resulting properties and characteristics equal to or superior to those currently available. In addition, it is indicated that the process potentially can manufacture such tubing at substantially lower cost. The concept of hydrostatic extrusion is based upon the phenomena associated with plasticity of metals under high pressure and in layman's terms is a substitution of pressure for temperature in the forming of metals and metal alloys. Metalworking under pressure is not neces- sarily a new technology; however, the application of this technology toward the production of tubing is new. It is indicated that the process will yield tubing with improved ductility, higher strength, small grain size, and optimum grain structure. By proper choice of the amount of cold work and thermal treatment after hydrostatic extrusion, a wide range of properties can be reproducibly obtained-in all instances, such properties exceed those of contem- porary specification requirements. 730632.

This paper details the influence on heat fluxes of engine speed, compression ratio, intake pressure, swirl ratio, location on the cylinder head surface, and the shape of the piston top. Equations are given to show the method of calculation used in deriving the data on heat transfer rates. 1973 SA E Transactions 730633. A Turbocharged Spark Ignition Engine with Low Exhaust Emissions and Improved Fuel Economy. John F. Schweikert and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological University. Turbocharging, in addition to increasing an engine's power output, can be effectively used to maintain exhaust emission levels while improving fuel economy. This paper presents the emission and performance results obtained from a turbocharged multicylinder spark ignition engine with thermal reactors and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) operated at steady-state, part-load conditions for four engine speeds. When comparing a turbocharged engine to a larger displacement naturally aspirated engine of equal power output, the emissions expressed in grams per mile were relatively unchanged both with and without EGR. However, turbocharging provided an average of 20% improvement in fuel economy both with and without EGR. When comparing the turbocharged and nonturbo- charged versions of the same engine without EGR at a given load and speed, turbocharging increased the hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions and decreased oxides of nitrogen (NOJ emissions. With the addition of EGR, turbocharging increased all three emissions. When comparing turbocharged and nonturbocharged engines of equal displacement on the heavy-duty 13-mode dynamometer cycle, turbocharging reduced CO emissions and increased the HC and NOx emissions both with and without EGR. 730634. A Spark Ignition Engine with an In-Cylinder Thermal Reactor. A. J. Jessel, O. A. Uyehara and P. S. Myers, Dept. of Mechanical Engineer- ing, University of Wisconsin. This paper describes a method and apparatus intended to minimize hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric oxide (NO) in spark ignition engine exhaust by utilizing the unused displacement of the engine at part loads as an internal thermal reactor. The method used is to induct exhaust gas plus air into one portion of the cylinder and unthrottled fuel-air charge into the balance. The fuel-air charge is rich to minimize NO formation, but, as a result, the products of combustion contain HC and CO. Air is added to these products before re-induction to provide additional oxygen to complete the oxidation which is promoted by the high pressures and temperatures of compression and combustion. Load control is achieved by varying the relative amounts of fuel-air charge and recirculated exhaust. Experimentally, it was shown that the necessary stratification existed until the spark occurred but not thereafter. The very low NO concentrations expected were realized, but HC and CO values were higher than desired. Discussion: R. M. Siewert, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. 1973 SA E Transactions 730635. The Harmonization of Truck Technical Regu- lations within the European Common Market. John Alden, Vauxhall Motors Ltd. In the United Kingdom the impact of recently joining the Common Market has been considerable. The requirement to follow Common Market Directives has produced a situation where the new harmonized laws will eventually supersede the old. The new directives which will take some years to become fully effective are aimed at eliminating the barriers affecting the operation of com- mercial vehicles which have divided Europe in the past and the inauguration and implementation of a common transport policy. Widely different regulations are viewed as very serious barriers to trade in Europe and, indeed, on a worldwide scale they are becoming very serious barriers to international trade. The difference between the rule-making procedure in Europe and the United States is explained, and the interesting and important differences between the Euro- pean Type Approval system as compared with the American self-certification procedure are discussed in some detail. Recognition of the parameters involved in the for- mation of the European organizing bodies is explained and an interpretation of the relative importance of each organization is presented. The current list of Common Market Directives affecting truck design is explained with some comment on the reasoning behind them. This is followed by reference to future technical regulation activity and the direction and trend of various important factors such as lighting and signaling, weights, dimensions, and performance critiera which will affect the future operation in the longer term of all European commercial vehicles. The future classification methods of rating vehicles is given, and detailed reference is made to environmental trends on safety and exhaust emission. 730636. Factors Affecting the Design of Transmissions for Heavy-Duty Trucks in Europe. J. F. B. Harper and T. R. Radcliffe, Eaton Transmission Div., Ltd. (England); and H. Klein, Eaton G.m.b.H. (Germany). This paper traces the evolution of heavy-duty truck transmissions in Europe, comments on the factors that 166</page><page sequence="90">have influenced and will influence the designs, compares some of the types in current use, and gives the author's views on possible lines of further development in the next decade. The ultimate predominance of any particular truck transmission will, of course, be the result of compromise between legislative, economic, and geograph- ic factors. All these influences vary considerably in their effects on European truck manufacture as compared to that in the United States. The discussion of these differences points up areas of interest to manufacturers of transmissions who engage in export of their products. 730637. Road Transport in Western Europe - Description of a Typical Range of Vehicles and Future Developments. D. Filtri and F. Pinolini, Fiat S.p.a. The conditions of road haulage in Europe are briefly examined, with particular reference to the main char- acteristics of vehicles, engines, and components used for the different applications. The importance of light and medium trucks in European haulage is stressed, taking into account the geographic characteristics, the existing road network, and the regulations presently in force. A typical range of light and medium trucks are then described as an illustration of the characteristics required. Future developments are considered with respect to foreseeable regulations for vehicles weights and dimen- sions, power-to-weight ratios, safety, and pollution re- quirements. 730638. Design Concept and Development of Magiras- Deutz Heavy Duty Truck Line. Heinz W. Hahn, Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG (Germany). European truck users prefer vehicles for which all main components are made by one producer. Thus, manu- facturers must design and produce these components for their entire line. Moreover, a high percentage of export models consists of variations required by government regulations and customer demands. Obviously satisfying domestic and foreign trade would not be economically feasible unless many components were interchargeable throughout the line. Magirus-Deutz has solved this problem by adopting the modular concept for a new range of vehicles, from the 11-32 to off- and on-highway trucks to the 130-340 hp air-cooled buses with a 15-row seating capacity with air-cooled engines of 130-340 hp. This paper describes their methods for applying component modules as a means of producing a high-quality, high-quantity range of different trucks and buses at least cost. 730639. Designing a Complete range of Trucks of 13-44 ton gvw. Carlos Carreras and Juan P. Clar, Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A. (Spain). Four years ago the engineering department of Pegaso was faced with the need to develop a completely new line of trucks, with a gvw range of 13-44 tons and having a maximum interchangeability of parts so that customer 730637-730642 reguirements and export market regulations could be met with least cost and yearly production of 15,000-25,000 vehicles. This paper describes profile and frame designs and also those of new engines, axles, and cabs. The new designs incorporate many of the features that have proved satisfactory in other applications such as marine and industrial engines, and construction equipment. Exper- imental data and statistical results of the first year's production are presented. 730640. Future-Orientated Design and Development of Commercial Vehicles. A. Müller-Berner, Daim- ler-Benz AG (Germany). This paper describes the Mercedes-Benz series 400 engines which are intended for use on trucks and buses. The series consists of in-line and Vee configurations with power outputs of 130-400 hp. All of the engines are designed to accommodate turbocharging to produce higher outputs. Also described are the series 7 rear axles which have a single lead carrying capacity of 9-16 tons and a power transmission capacity of 140-600 hp. Both the axles and the engines are designed for maximum part interchangeability in order to reduce production costs. 730641. The Mather Jackknife Control Unit. M. A. Ordorica, The Mather Co. Jackknifing occurs with and without braking. It occurs whenever the slip angles of the rear tractor wheels exceed the value at which the maximum side force is developed. Jackknifing will occur even with partial skid of rear tractor wheels because the semitrailer pushes on the hitch introducing a yaw moment, which in turn, increases the tractor's yaw rate. Since no satisfactory solution is available to the jackknifing problem through controlled braking, the Mather Control Unit is developed to employ the velocity2 or V2 damping characteristic so desirable to driver control, which provides low damping at low yaw rates, but increases rapidly to provide adequate counter torque at about 5°/second and thus effectively control jackknifing with or without braking. 730642. Use of Simplified Jackknife Restraint Device Significantly Reduces the Hazard of Jackknifing. Ralph E. Walsh and Gildo E. Cicchetti, Breeze Corporations, Inc. A simple jackknife restraint device which is integrated with the vehicle's normal braking system controls against the hazard of jackknifing in tractor/trailer operations. The device operates in conjunction with the vehicle's braking system, and the braking action restrains the vehicle from articulating into a dangerous jackknife attitude. The jackknife control mechanism, composed of four major parts, is described, and operation of the control is explained in terms of geometry of installation. Testing of the control is also discussed. 167</page><page sequence="91">730643-730649 730643. Jackknife Control for Tractor-Trailer. A. T. Keller, Keller Products Co. A method to stop jackknifing of all tractor-trailer vehicles by controlling the angle between the tractor and the trailer to a maximum of 15 deg of movement to either side is discussed. Most jackknifing occurs when the driver is forced into an unexpected lane change or into a panic stop to avoid an accident. Tests have proved that when a trac tor- trailer is in a 25 deg or more angle, the vehicle is then in an "angle of no return" and a jackknife can occur. When road conditions are unfavorable, due to rain, ice, or snow, the jackknife will be more severe. 730644. A Transmission System for Single-Shaft Gas Turbine Powered Trucks. C. E. Kraus and M. E. Gres, Tracor, Inc. A transmission and energy storage and translation system concept is presented which allows a single-shaft turbine driven truck to have comparable performance to one powered with an internal combustion piston engine. The proposed system reduces the acceleration lag and stalling characteristics of a single-shaft turbine driven vehicle, while allowing a very wide torque range to improve the fuel economy of the engine. 730645. Transmission for Automotive Single-Shaft Gas Turbine and Turbo-Rankine Engines. R. C. Bowlin, A. J. Smalley and H. F. Jones, Jr., Mechanical Technology Inc. A study of various transmissions for advanced automotive single-shaft gas turbine and turbo-Rankine engines led to selection of a variable ratio hydromechanical transmission as the most promising transmission on a near-term development basis. Detailed design analysis of this transmission showed that, in comparison with a 3-speed automatic transmission, it had approximately the same weight, was 28% smaller in size, and initial production cost could be 30-40% greater. The comparable weight of the selected transmission suggests that, with future production development, the cost could approach that of the 3-speed automatic. From a performance viewpoint, the selected transmission offered significant fuel economy advantages for a single-shaft gas turbine. For the turbo-Rankine engine, the selected hydromechanical transmission offered little performance advantage compared to a conventional automatic transmission, unless future design develop- ments for this type of engine result in increased sensitivity of specific fuel consumption to engine speed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730646. Present State-of-the-Art of the Philips Stirling Engine. H. C. J. van Beukering and H. Fokker, N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken. This paper deals with the progress in research, devel- opment, and engineering of the Stirling engine at Philips, which has led to the present state-of-the-art. After a review of the performance and features of some selected types of engines built and projected at Philips in the past two decades, a survey is given of typical characteristics of engine that can be realized now and which are envisaged for a variety of applications, including the automotive field. 730647. Free Piston Stirling Engines - A Progress Report. William Beale, William Holmes, Stephen Lewis and Edmund Cheng, Ohio University. The concentric piston-displacer type of free-piston Stirling engine is being developed at Ohio University for use as a gas-fired air conditioner, a long-life isotope powered electric generator, a solar-electric energy converter, a solar water pump, and a simple classroom demonstrator. A linear alternator-engine combination has demon- strated 8% overall efficiency at a power output of 17 W with 600 K (620° F) heater wall temperature. A free-cylinder water pump intended for solar energy operation has achieved 6% overall system efficiency using electric heat at 790 K (960° F). An engine intended for gas-fired air conditioning has reached 1 kW power output and has demonstrated an ability of self-start on application of heat at 370 K (200° F). Some experiments have been made with condensing working fluids capable of producing power at low heater temperature. Several design innovations have been made, including a very simple and effective method of preventing piston position creep, and several means of displacer driving. 730648. The Stirling Engine for Passenger Car Appli- cation. Norman D. Postma, Ford Motor Co.; Rob Van Giessel and Frits Reinink, N. V. Philips (Holland). This paper describes a detailed theoretical and experi- mental study program of a 170 bhp (SAE net) Stirling engine, designed for a 1972 Ford Torino. The program, conducted by Ford Motor Co. and N. V. Philips of Holland, had as its objectives the demonstration of the Stirling engine emission capability, packageability, vehicle performance and fuel economy, and identification of possible future problems. Results of the investigation to date are that the engine has a potential for low emissions, low noise levels, engine performance with good response and drivability, excellent fuel economy if adequately cooled. The engine can be packaged within the conven- tional engine compartment if accommodation for the large radiator can be found. Major problems are cooling system requirement, use of hydrogen as a working fluid, maintenance of low emission for 50,000 miles, and manufacturing and facilities cost. The results were encouraging enough to continue the program to the design, building, and testing phase. 730649. Full-Scale Laboratory Testing. E. Franchini, C. Rossi and P. Filippa, Fiat S.p.A. (Italy). 168</page><page sequence="92">This paper describes the use of a road simulator by Fiat to determine the effects of vibration and loads imposed on various parts of a vehicle. The instrument has been effective in identifying vibration sources that induce fatigue or discomfort or which may cause inefficient operation or a breakdown. The laboratory tests include clear procedures for obtaining preliminary information or for tracing down existing conditions. 730650. Tuning Techniques for Controlling Heavy-Duty Truck Shake - Vertical, Torsional, and Lateral. Takeshi Inoh and Masaharu Aisaka, Isuzu Motors Ltd. (Japan). Tuning techniques for controlling three principal modes of plastic vibration - vertical, torsional, and lateral - in the frame/body structure of a heavy-duty truck are discussed. The components involved in the solution of the shake problem are the frame/cargo-body structure, the cab mounting, and the powerplant mounting. The method followed in this experiment was a three-dimensional mathematical model analysis using a transfer matrix. The theoretical estimates showed appreciable correlation with the experimental results obtained by using a electro- hydraulic shaker system. This technique, based upon a study of the effects of various components on the three modes of shake, was applied to production trucks and produced quite favorable results. 730651. Simulation of a Tandem Axle Tractor-Trailer with Experimental Validation. Richard A. Har- wood and Michael J. Crosby, Lord Corp.; and Robert F. Zalokar, Mack Trucks, Inc. A digital computer simulation of an on-highway tandem axle tractor-trailer has been developed. The mathematical model is presented in state variable form and includes nonlinearities, such as suspension friction and shock absorber characteristics. The primary purpose of the simulation is the evaluation of suspension characteristics and their effect on truck ride. Comparisons showing good correlation between sim- ulation and experimental results are presented for tran- sient runs of the tractor-trailer over disturbances such as 2 X 4's and ramps. 730652. Stabilaire Truck Drive Axle Suspension: Series 400. H. C. Harbers and H. C. Harbers, Jr., Western Unit Corp. This paper describes the development of a heavy-duty light-weight truck drive axle air suspension for use on single and tandem axles. A review and evaluation of various air suspensions is made to establish design parameters and their application to the new Series 400 unit. Mathematical analysis and detail photographs are included. 730653. Tractor-Semitrailer Handling: A Dynamic Trac- tor Suspension Model. Ronald J. Vincent and Allen I. Krauter, Cornell University. 730650-730657 This paper describes the addition of tandem-drive axles and tractor suspension dynamics to a digital computer model of a tractor-semitrailer truck. The extended model provides 22 degrees of freedom for the vehicle. Two degrees of freedom are included for the motion of each tractor axle; vertical tire flexibility, tandem-axle suspen- sion jacking, and tandem-axle roll steer are also included in the extended model. The features of the previous vehicle model (based on the work of Mikulcik) are retained in the extended model. These features include nonlinear equations for translation, yaw, pitch, and roll of both the tractor and the semitrailer (except as these motions are constrained by the fifth wheel), wheel rotation dynamics, and antiskid brake control. The model also includes a simulated "driver" which specifies the steering angle and the air pressure applied to the brakes. The extended model is compared with the prior model by performing comparison tests involving simultaneous cornering and braking. The model is then used to investigate the effects of nonhorizontal torque rods at the tandem axles on the behavior of the vehicle. 730654. A New Concept in Commercial Vehicle Suspen- sion. Wallace G. Chalmers, Chalmers Suspen- sions International Ltd. Developed to cut down on maintenance costs and increase the earning power of the vehicle, this family of suspen- sions provides for improved vehicular behavior - items such as stability, braking, cornering, and overall ride. The suspensions utilize a principle of providing a cushioned variable rate ride through the use of molded rubber springs. Floating walking beams distribute weight equally on both axles in the case of tandems. The axles are positively located by upper wishbones and lower torque rods. The parallelogram thus formed prevents windup and axle hop. The correct use of metals shows a substantial weight saving in the entire model range. 730656. Truck Vibration Diagnostics Using a New Elec- tronic Technique. Lyle V. Rennick, Electro- Mechanical Div., Northrop Corp. A technique is described for diagnosing the vibration source in a vehicle as it is driven on the road. The basic problem is to determine whether the vibration is related to excessive engine or transmission vibration, driveshaft imbalance, driveline misalignment, U-joints, differential, or wheel assembly imbalance; and, in the latter case, to isolate which faulty wheel. The technique developed is to integrate samples of the vibration signal taken synchron- ously with the various rotating parts. The feasibility of the technique was demonstrated on two heavy trucks and several passenger vehicles. 730657. Maintenance Indicator System for Military Trucks. W. Obits, Teledyne Continental Motors; and D. Ancona, U.S. Army Tank- Automoti ve Command. 169</page><page sequence="93">730658-730661 The Maintenance Indicator System (MIS) is a completely automatic system that monitors the condition and per- formance of critical subsystems and accessories of a vehicle and its engine. Although designed specifically for the military lx/2 ton and 5 ton trucks, the indicator system can be adapted to most military and commercial vehicles with minor modifications to suit the particular require- ments. MIS consists of a dashboard-mounted display panel located in full view of the operator and connected through a wiring harness to sensors permanently mounted on or within various systems and accessories of the engine and vehicle. The sensors monitor critical parameters and alert the driver or mechanic by a light activated on the panel when service is required or a malfunction has occurred. Maintenance functions indicated by MIS include: fuel supply pressure to engine, engine primary fuel filter condition, radiator coolant level, engine coolant temper- ature, engine oil level, engine oil pressure, engine oil filter condition, alternator/generator output, vehicle battery voltage, vehicle air/hydraulic brake system condition, transmission operating temperature, air cleaner condition, and transfer case operating temperature. 730658. Diagnostic Instrumentation for Military Vehicles. N. A. Teixeira, Aerospace Systems Div., RCA Corp.; and F. Pradko, D. Sarna and P. Garland, U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Command. In common with other owners and operators of large fleets of vehicles, the U.S. Army is faced with a major maintenance task. A significant part of this task is the correct and timely diagnosis of the vehicle faults which cause down time and those which can propagate into secondary, and usually more serious, damage. The Army, of course, has two operational situations which differ in type and degree from those of commercial fleets. First, the duty cycle for Army vehicles is less predictable and instant availability is essential. The second is that Army vehicles are armored, shielded and waterproofed (ford- able) to an extent that test point access is severely limited in comparison to commercial vehicles. To grapple with this situation, the U.S. Army Tank- Automoti ve Command has placed a series of contracts for feasibility studies with RCA's Aerospace Systems Division to investigate the practicality and the means for preinstrumentation of vehicles and for devising appropriate control and readout test units compatible with this built-in instrumentation. In the process of this work, several new' transducers have been developed, and a concept for testing for engine power has been applied. Two new instruments have been designed and tested for feasibility. A "vehicle readiness unit," suitable for use in on-board monitoring of road tests and sample runs, with provision for a simple engine power test and for detecting marginal ignition systems, is also described. A "vehicle test meter," which permits a diagnostic survey to be performed at better than a 10:1 time savings over conventional maintenance procedures, is discussed. In addition, a computer-controlled unit developed by the Army for detailed diagnostic tests has been adapted and software developed to permit operation with the built-in instrumentation (diagnostic connector). The basic objectives and operating principles of these devices are presented. 1973 SA E Transactions 730659. Diagnostic Levels Required for Heavy-Duty Vehicles. Tom Mannix, Ryder System Inc. This paper defines the need for more complete diagnostic systems as options for heavy commercial vehicles. Areas and indicators are defined for current and future operator requirements. Return on the operators investment is demonstrated on the basis of vehicle utilization. Current prototypes and pilot evaluations are discussed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730660. Diesel Smoke Analysis on a Chassis Dynamom- eter. Gilbert Williams and Frank W. Hartman, Jr., White Motor Corp.; and George R. Mackey, Clayton Mfg. Co. Enactment and enforcement of stringent smoke emission regulations has created need for a method to determine if the exhaust opacity of in-service vehicles exceeds legal limits as they are driven on the road. This can be accomplished by running a 3 min chassis dynamometer test cycle, which is based upon the Environmental Protection Agency diesel engine certification procedure. Simultaneous recordings of speed and exhaust opacity permit modal analysis for identification of specific malfunctioning components and consequent improved cost effectiveness of maintenance expenditures. 1973 SA E Transactions 730661. Analysis and Control of Transient Flow in the Diesel Injection System Part I - The Analytical Control Method. Mohamed F. El-Erian, E. Benjamin Wylie and Jay A. Bolt, University of Michigan. The increasing requirements imposed on diesel engine manufacturers have required the study of fuel injection system faults and the development of means to eliminate them. Until now, improved injection system character- istics have been obtained by experimental trial-and-error procedures. These procedures, however, have proved to be inconvenient, tedious, and have had limited success in eliminating system faults such as after-injection. This is mainly because the transient nature of the injection process requires a more thorough study of the system time-varying parameters. In this paper the residual transients which cause after-injection are analytically investigated. The control of these transients required specification of some system parameter. The rapidly varying nature of the system pressures and flows prevented the use of these variables as control parameters. On the other hand, the average 170</page><page sequence="94">instantaneous elastic energy stored in the system was found to be a well-behaved function of time and was therefore selected as the control parameter. A design procedure to control after-injection was formulated. In this procedure, design changes required to achieve improved system characteristics were obtained by specification of the average elastic energy function. Two design changes were considered. These included the design of an additional control valve in the pump delivery chamber and the redesign of the pump spill port. The design techniques used in the control method are de- scribed in this paper, while the application, results, and experimental verifications are given in a companion paper. 1973 SA E Transactions 730662. Analysis and Control of Transient Flow in the Diesel Injection System, Part II - Design Results of Controlled After-Injection. Mohamed F. El-Erian, E. Benjamin Wylie and Jay A. Bolt, University of Michigan. After-injection is the introduction of additional fuel to the combustion chamber after the end of the main injection. It is a persistent diesel fuel injection problem which usually results in reduced engine power and economy and increased emissions. After-injection is caused by uncon- trolled pressure transients at the injector after the opening of the pump spill port. These pressure transients are related to the wave propagation phenomena in the high-pressure pipeline connecting the pump and injector. Use of experimental trial-and-error methods in attempts to control this phenomenon has met with limited success. The analytical control method described in another paper is used to determine design means by which after-injection may be controlled. Further investigation and evaluation of two design changes which release the injection system excess elastic energy in a controlled manner are considered herein. One design change is the addition of a control valve in the pump delivery chamber. The other is the modification of the pump spill port. In both cases, pressures and flows are not altered during the main injection period. The ability of both design changes to control after-injection is confirmed by use of a simulation program. Experimental data from a system with the pump spill port modified in accordance with theoretical design calculations provide satisfactory con- firmation of the analyses. 1973 SA E Transactions 730663. Computer Technique for Evaluation of Cavitation Characteristics of Certain Phases of Fuel Injec- tion in Fuel Injection System. Kojiro Yamaoka and Atsushi Saito, Yanmar Diesel Engine Co., Ltd. (Japan). The simulated calculation of a fuel injection system is now possible by the use of a computer. However, this calculation does not seem completely satisfactory. 730662-730664 In the conventional methods of calculation, separate calculation equations must be used when a void (the absence of oil) occurs in the injection system. Further- more, the boundary condition equations applied at both ends of a high-pressure pipe were believed to be inade- quate. In this paper, several improvements are attempted. A quantity that varies from positive to negative value is used as the fundamental variable in the calculations. Also, experiments were made using a test apparatus with a transparent boundary part for both observation and measurement. Moreover, incorporating the fundamental variable, the boundary condition equations were made applicable both to the state of compression and a void condition. The result of these improvements shows that the simulated calculations procedure is more convenient and widely applicable compared with the procedure used until now. Those improvements are described through the prop- agation phenomenon in a high-pressure pipe, which is the basis of an injection system. 1 973 SA E Transactions 730664. Analysis of Bypass Control Fuel Injection Sys- tems for Small Diesel Engines by Digital Com- puter. Kojiro Yamaoka, Atsushi Saito, Nobu- yuki Abe and Mako to Okazaki, Yanmar Diesel Engine Co., Ltd. (Japan). Conventional analyses are concerned with an overflow type of pump. However, in this paper, the bypass control type of pump is analyzed, and this analysis includes a fuel tank, and oil pipe, and a feed chamber, which until now have scarcely been analyzed. The potential energy and fluid resistance of oil pipes are considered, and in the high-pressure pipe, the fluid resistance is considered. In conventional analyses, when a void appeared in the fuel injection system, it was necessary to substitute a different equation, and the treatment on the volume of void was believed to be unsatisfactory. In this paper, improvements of these points have been attempted. When simulating a fuel injection system, it is neces- sary to determine such physical characteristics as the compressibility of fuel oil, the specific weight of fuel oil, the sonic velocity of fuel oil, the flow coefficent, etc. However, in the experimental characteristics obtained previously, there have been some unclear questions regarding the mixed air, the oil temperature, and the pressure. In this paper, these characteristics of the fuel and of the injection system were measured experimentally. By incorporating these results in the simulated calculation, the results are in good agreement with the actual phenomenon, even when there is a void in the system and the computation time is short. The calcula- tional procedure is thus considered to be applicable for practical purposes. 1973 SAE Transactions 171</page><page sequence="95">730665-730670 730665. Improvement in Transient Performance of a Tur bochar ged Diesel Engine by Air Injection into the Compressor. J. D. Ledger, R. S. Benson and H. Furukawa, University of Manchester Insti- tute of Science and Technology (England). One of the methods for improving the transient response of a turbocharged diesel engine is to accelerate the turbocharger by injecting air onto the impeller of the compressor. This paper describes experiments carried out on a turbocharger test rig in which air was injected through nozzles at the rotor tips of the centrifugal compressor; performance characteristics are presented. Results from these tests were then used to modify a digital simulation model of a medium-speed turbocharged diesel engine so that air injection could be applied at the onset of a load. Calculations show the predicted improvement in response of the system to step-load changes. Discussion: D. Wollatt and Authors' closure 1973 SA E Transactions 730666. Comparison of Experimental and Simulated Transient Responses of a Turbocharged Diesel Engine. R. S. Benson, J. D. Ledger, N. D. Whitehouse and S. Walmsley, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (England). Comparison is made between the transient response of a medium-speed, turbocharged diesel engine subjected to sudden load changes on a test bed and the response of a computer simulation model of the engine. Brief details are given of the simulation techniques involved and the data required to set up the model. Despite close agreement of model and engine steady-state results over the whole normal operating range, the transient responses of the model were initially found to be much faster than the test-bed response. It is shown that the most important factor causing this difference is the lack of knowledge of the combustion at low air-fuel ratios and hence prediction of engine exhaust temperature during transient operation. Good agreement was obtained when this was modified. Discussion: J. W. Dennis, Caterpillar Tractor Co.; Authors' closure 1973 SA E Transactions 730667. Some Further Tests on a Computer Program to Simulate Internal Combustion Engines. R. S. Benson and P. C. Baruah, University of Man- chester Institute of Science and Technology (England). The results are presented of an extensive series of tests on a turbocharged 4-stroke diesel engine in which the test results are compared with predictions using a generalized computer program. An examination is made of the influence of the cylinder heat transfer coefficient, the cylinder wall temperature, the exhaust pipe wall temper- ature, and the air valve flow areas on the engine and turbocharger performance predictions in order to estab- lish the limits of accuracy required for these data. The effect of including the intake system in the calculation is also examined. Results are presented comparing the actual per- formance of the trubocharger with the predicted per- formance using steady flow data. 730668. Experiments on Rotary Valve under Steady and Unsteady Flow Conditions. Junjiro Iwamoto, Tokyo Electrical Engineering College (Japan). Although the flow through the poppet valves of the four-stroke cycle engine and piston valves and rotary valves of the two-stroke cycle engine is unsteady, because of the periodic area change of the flow passage of the valves, the flow characteristic of these valves is usually evaluated by steady-flow conditions. The author experi- mented with flow characteristics under steady and unsteady conditions by using a rotary valve, in order to specify the difference between them and to identify the factors that effect this difference. According to the results obtained, inertia of the mass of the fluid in the flow passage of the valve is the most important factor in creating this difference of flow between them. A theo- retical analysis of this inertia was found useful in predicting the effect of various parameters on flow through the passage of the valve under an unsteady condition. These results have brought about a better understanding of the phenomena that occur during unsteady flow through the valves. 730669. Comparison of Emission Indexes within a Turbine Combuster Operated on Diesel Fuel or Methanol. Clayton W. LaPointe and Weston L. Schultz, Ford Motor Co. The emission index (grams of species/kilogram of fuel) field within a regenerative turbine combustor has been mapped using a water-cooled sampling probe. The probe employed a choked orifice to simultaneous determine the local temperature. Derived from measurements are: air-fuel ratio, combustion efficiency, average fuel velocity, and fuel distribution factor. Methods of averaging the discrete data are developed. A comparison of data obtained when the combustor was operated on each of two fuels revealed that the use of methanol leads to lower nitric oxide but higher carbon monoxide emission than does the "use of diesel fuel. 1973 SA E Transactions 730670. Simple Automobile Gas Turbine Combustors for Low Emissions. J. A. Saintsbury, P. Sampath and H. C. Eatock, United Aircraft of Canada Ltd. Combustors suitable for both simple- and regenerative- cycle automotive gas turbine engines have been designed and rig developed for low exhaust emissions. The simple-cycle combustor has demonstrated potential for meeting the EPA 1976 automotive emission standards, employing simple practical hardware with no variable geometry. Low emissions have been rig demonstrated with 172</page><page sequence="96">the regenerative combustor, but techniques such as variable geometry and/or regenerator bypass will prob- ably have to be used to achieve target emission levels. Severe transients under actual driving conditions of the regenerative engines are expected to make it particularly difficult to duplicate rig results. 1973 SA E Transactions 730671. Performance of a Homogeneous Combustor for a Rankine Cycle Steam Engine. Joseph Gerstmann and Francesco Pompei, Scientific Energy Sys- tems Corp. A compact gasoline-fired homogeneous combustor has been developed for use in a Rankine cycle steam generator. The combustor takes advantage of staged cooling of the combustion products to limit the formation of nitric oxide while promoting the oxidation of carbon monoxide. The principles of operation and some of the design details of the burner are described. Steady-state emissions measurements are presented, and the per- formance of the staged quenching is compared with its predicted performance. 730672. Low Emission Combustor Development for Au- tomotive Rankine-Cycle Engines. Ravinder K. Sakhuja and Andrew D. Vasilakis, Thermo Electron Corp. The develpment of two low emission combustors for an automotive Rankine cycle engine is described. Emphasis has been placed on low emissions, fast response, compact- ness, and low parasitic power. Air atomization and rotary atomization of fuel have been incorporated, leading to two different combustor configurations. Emission character- istics of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides of nitrogen (NOJ are described for both concepts. HC and CO emissions have been generally found to be well below 1976 federal standards for automotive emis- sions. Fine atomization of fuel and thorough air-fuel mixing have been found to be the keys to low NOx emissions. The use of exhaust gas recirculation reduced NOx emissions significantly. Effects of excess air and cooled primary zone are also shown. 730673. Parameter Studies in Articulated Vehicle Han- dling. R. L. Eshleman, T. M. Scopelite and S. Desai, UT Research Inst. This paper presents the results of a parameter variation study conducted on typical single- and double-articulated vehicles using the AVDS II computer simulation model. The vehicle dynamic responses and driver steering and braking response demands during 12 ft wide lane-change maneuvers are determined for varying discrete values of maneuver length, vehicle velocity, road-tire friction coefficient, fifth wheel damping, vehicle geometry (fifth wheel location), and vehicle loading. Effects of brake unbalance and aerodynamic loads on vehcile responses are also evaluated. 730671-730676 730674. Analytical-Experimental Response of Articulated Vehicles. R. L. Eshleman, S. Desai and D. W. Hanify, IIT Research Inst. Analytical-experimental studies were conducted on a tractor-semitrailer vehicle performing prescribed lane- change maneuvers. This paper shows the validation of the Articulated Vehicle Dynamic Simulation model (AVDS II) with full-scale tractor-semitrailer field tests. Exper- imental data on the tractor trajectory and braking were used as computer input, and the simulation model response results were compared with the vehicle responses from the experimental tests on a time-transient basis. Analytical-experimental validation is shown for varied vehicle speeds and braking during maneuvers. 730675. How to Use a Lightweight Powerplant to Increase Payload. R. N. Janeway, Janeway Engineering Co. The advent of turbine power for commercial vehicles raises the question of how best to convert the promised weight saving into an equivalent increase in payload. The practical importance of the method adopted to maintain maximum axle load limits, in the case of truck tractors, lies in the profound effects on ride of the wide changes possible in the dynamic index. This paper reviews the basic principles of weight distribution effects on vehicle ride to bring out the quantitative significance of the dynamic index. This criterion is then applied to the prediction of the conse- quences to riding quality of any combination of fifth- wheel offset and wheelbase, at constant axle loads. General equations are derived and their use is illustrated for the case of a typical tractor, with assumed powerplant weight reductions up to 2000 lb. The principal conclusions are: 1. Axle loads should be maintained by using the shortest possible wheelbase combined with slight increase in fifth-wheel offset. 2. Powerplant locations should be as far forward as possible, preferably ahead of front axle. 3. In general, the design objective in adapting a lighter powerplant should be to attain the highest possible dynamic index within practical limits. 730676. Truck Chassis Component Redesign to Reduce Weight. Francis O. Gadd, GMC Truck &amp; Coach Div., General Motors Corp. This paper discusses the means by which several major heavy-duty truck components have been redesigned from conventional material, such as malleable iron, nodular iron, or fabricated steel, to cast, stamped, extruded, or forged aluminum in order to reduce overall vehicle weight. Design life for lightweight parts had to meet the same criteria as the standard parts they replaced. All com- ponents discussed in this paper are available in current production trucks. 173</page><page sequence="97">730677-730684 730677. Operability of Automotive Diesel Equipment at Temperatures Below Fuel Cloud Point. N. Feld- man, Esso Research and Engineering Co. The use of wax-crystal modifiers for improving low- temperature operability of diesel fuel has not been possible in the United States because the large crystals could not penetrate the very fine porosity of fuel filters. The development of new, extremely potent additive packages has solved this problem by reducing the size of the crystals precipitated in the diesel fuel. The smaller size allows them to pass through the fine filters of auto-diesel equipment at temperatures well below the cloud point, even under extreme field conditions. On the basis of successful testing of additive-treated diesel fuel, cloud point can no longer be considered as an indication of operability limit in auto-diesel equipment. It is desirable, therefore, to develop a laboratory flow test that predicts the field performance of diesel fuels - flow improved or not - and accept it as the basis for a new operability guideline for diesel fuel equipment. 730678. Benefits of Modern Diesel Engine Diagnostic Tools in Fleet Maintenance and Engine Testing of Fuels and Lubricants. C. R. Forsman, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp.; and W. R. Schwindeman, International Div., Mobil Oil Corp. Modern electronic diagnostic equipment, which displays fuel injection pressure curves, combustion pressure pat- terns and compression quality, has been used to improve the reliability and repeatability of laboratory engine tests used for lubricant development and evaluation. Major savings in man hours per test engine and greater engine availability have been obtained, along with great im- provement in test repeatability. The same equipment used in fleet maintenance has provided sibnificant savings by detecting incipient break- downs in time to make repairs and avoid engine replace- ment and on-the-road failures. The fleets tested showed 10-25% of the vehicles had specific malfunctions which could produce costly failures if not immediately repaired. 730679. Hot Corrosion of Diesel Engine Exhaust Valves. Asim Chaudhuri, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The purpose of this paper is to show that although "hot corrosion" (which is, in fact, a sulfidation-accelerated oxidation phenomenon) is more prevalent in gas turbine applications, diesel engines are not immune to this under certain conditions. Evidence of this type of corrosion in the case of some iron-base and nickel-base exhaust valves is presented to illustrate the point. The successive stages of the corrosion process are discussed, and the beneficial effects of some alloying elements in affording protection against hot corrosion are pointed out. Discussion: Wallace Matlock, TRW, Inc. 1973 SA E Transactions 730680. A Method for Determining the Noise Levels and Performance Parameters for Truck Cooling Fans. S. O. Fleischer, Proving Ground Section, Gen- eral Motors Corp. A test method for accurately determining the noise levels of truck cooling fans, as a function of their performance, has been developed. Correlation between the calculated results, using this test method, and experimental results of tests with a simulated truck cooling system environment has been demonstrated. Since fan noise is a major component noise source for trucks, this procedure is of particular interest to engineers involved in meeting legislated vehicle noise levels. 1973 SA E Transactions 730681. Diesel Engine Noise Reduction Hardware for Vehicle Noise Control. S. H. Jenkins and H. K. Kuehner, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. A range of noise reduction hardware is described for three production engine models, as well as the rationale for selecting noise reduction methods. Noise reductions up to 6 dB(A) were achieved with this hardware in the test cell. In many cases the modifications are more effective in vehicles. The success of the hardware in reducing overall vehicle noise is illustrated. 730682. Reducing Noise from Heavy Diesel Trucks by Engine Compartment Shielding. John Rönnhult, Scania Div., Saab-Scania (Sweden). A large number of laboratory tests on diesel engines have proved that noise emission can be reduced by more than 10 dB by applying insulation directly to the engine or by totally enclosing the engine. However, the application of these methods on trucks involves appreciable difficulty and time-consuming design modifications. This paper describes how significant noise reduction can be attained merely by soundly designed shielding, without the need for modifying the basic design of the truck. The method is based upon experience from other types of vehicles which, for a number of years, have already been equipped as standard with similar insulation The reduction attained in the noise emission is approximately 6 dB(A). Inconvenience during repairs and service has been reduced to a minimum by a well-planned design and simple mounting of the shields as well as ample exposure of the engine when the cab is tilted. 730684. Comparative Tests of Truck Compressed Air Dryers. Michael Hunsaker, Corporate Devel- opment Center, Royal Industries. Comparative test results are presented covering the following four types of truck compressed air dryers; aftercoolers, centrifugal filters, dessicant dryers, and wet tank heat exchangers. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the operating characteristics of each of these types of dryers under varying operating conditions expected in truck usage and to determine the most appropriate use of eaćh dryer type. The results of these tests show, that except for 174</page><page sequence="98">unusually slow vehicles with heavy brake use, the wet tank heat exchanger is the best overall dryer available. This dryer is useable on even slow moving delivery trucks. The aftercooler is the second best overall choice and can be used on slow vehicles with excellent results. 730685. Air Brake Compressor Design for Extended Life and High Performance. Dario R. Gross and Richard J. Day, Midland-Ross Corp. This paper describes a new 2-cyl, reciprocating type, air compressor designed for use as an air source for heavy-duty truck air brake systems. It explains the objectives of a new design and how these objectives were met. A short history of present compressor deficiencies is given, together with recommendations to avoid these shortcomings. Emphasis is placed on positive design features to control oil consumption and minimize the formation of carbon. Also described are design features to eliminate structural failures on highly stressed, critical components found in present-day air compressors. 730686. Drag Reduction of Bluff Vehicles with Airvanes. Jeffrey W. Kirsch and Sabodh K. Garg, Sys- tems, Science and Software; and William Bettes, California Institute of Technology. An experimental wind tunnel program has been con- ducted to evaluate the drag reduction potential of airvanes located in close proximity to the leading and trailing edges of bluff vehicles. The airvanes are modified airfoils that direct an interior portion of the main airflow around a corner. In an optimal design, flow visualization exper- iments (with tufts) indicate that the outer flow is attached to the exterior vane surface. Front-mounted airvanes reduced the drag of a l/2o scale, square-cornered trailer (or bus) model by 38% for wind speeds between 40 and 120 mph. With a streamlined cab in position, there was a 30% drag reduction, but were found to be prone to interference effects. The study was limited to the zero crosswind condition and only one airfoil shape was evaluated. Of the parameters tested, airvane efficiencies were most sensitive to changes in the stand-off distances between the vane and the model surfaces. In a full-scale configuration, the airvanes need only protrude 1-2 in from the vehicle sides or roof. 730687. Aerodynamic Effects of Passing Vehicles. W. S. Johnson and F. H. Speckhart, University of Tennessee; and R. E. Bridwell, U. S. Air Force. This paper describes an investigation that was undertaken to evaluate the lateral forces and moments produced on a vehicle with large, flat lateral faces when it is passing or being passed by a large vehicle in an adjacent traffice lane. The forces and momments were determined from tests that were conducted in The University of Tennessee subsonic wind tunnel. They were, then, input to a computerized vehicle model to find the resulting dynamic response of the vehicle. These forces and moments were 730685-730690 sufficiently strong to produce a significant lateral devia- tion from the desired path of the vehicle. Resulting from this investigation, several recommendations were made to improve highway safety. 730688. Analysis of Lateral Stability for Doubles. Toshio Hazemoto, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (Japan). The lateral stability for doubles was analyzed in terms of frequency response and characteristic roots by using simple models (with the degree of freedom considered by taking into account lateral motion and yawing motion around vertical axis but excluding such factors as steering system, rolling, unsprung mass, and friction of coupling point). The value of frequency response found by actual testing was roughly in agreement with the value deter- mined by calculation. Effects of various parameters were also analyzed. This analysis afforded a guideline toward the determination of principal particulars for basic design. The effect of the loading condition of cargo is most unstable when the first trailer is empty of cargo and the second trailer is loaded. Stability is impaired when the trailer's e.g. is excessively shifted to the rear side. Such loss of stability affęcts the first trailer more than the second trailer. The stability of each trailer increases in proportion as the wheel base gains in length, and with the increasing cornering power of trailer wheels. For stability, the overhang at the position of the pintle hook should be as short as permissible. 730689. Which Spring? Where? R. N. Janeway, Janeway Engineering Co. In selecting springs for commercial vehicles, it is essential to consider the fundamental principles of the suspension system as a whole, as well as the specific spring characteristics. This paper discusses the application of these principles; also, it compares the many types of springs available, including single leaf, multileaf, and two-stage leaf springs, and coil, rubber, and pneumatic springs. Among the considerations stressed are: the relation- ships of spring static deflections to vehicle pitch frequency and oscillation center location, the questionability of two-stage leaf springs, the disadvantages of single tapered leaf versus multi-leaf springs, the advantages of coil springs in low weight and variable rate, and why pneumatic springs are ideal for large load range, heavy commercial vehicles. 730690. Determining Optimum V-Belt Replacement Mileage. Larry R. Oliver, Dayco Corp. V-belt replacement costs on alternator, air-conditioning, and power-steering drives can be reduced significantly by installing new belts at a time established by an age or block replacement plan, instead of waiting for belt failure. Methodology and a realistic example are presented for determining such plans and associated cost reductions. The plans are based upon historical belt failure data and 175</page><page sequence="99">730691-730698 upon the increase in after-failure replacement costs over those resulting from scheduled replacement prior to failure. 730691. High Speed Uniformity Machines and Nature of Tire Force Variations. Clarence Hofelt, Jr., Kenneth J. Gormish and David A. Corcoran, The General Tire and Rubber Co. High speed tire uniformity machines may be used to measure three-dimensional tire force variations (tire uniformity) that may not be measured at low speeds. Prototype machines will be described and some inherent problems outlined. Typical tire force variations, the influence of certain variables on these force variations, and the significance of these force variations will be given. 1973 SA E Transactions 730692. Truck Ignition Systems - Distributors. Dan Melillo, Ryder Systems, Inc.; and Norman Deckard, K &amp; R Delivery, Inc. This paper discusses in two parts requirements of ignition systems for trucks. In the first part the distributor - its problems and magnitude - is discussed mainly because it is the cause of much maintenance expense. Part II is devoted to the needs in a heavy-duty ignition system, wiring being the main topic. 730693. Vehicle Mission Simulation. T. Berenyi, R. L. Pershing and B. E. Romig, Deere &amp; Co. The vehicle mission simulation program predicts vehicle and implement forces and presents a complete description of vehicle trajectory for a given mission (job cycle). Productivity and cost accounting is performed and summarized at the conclusion of the mission. The purpose of the program is to enable objective evaluation of engineering alternatives in designing agricultural tractors which work -with attached implements. The vehicle operates on any given terrain defined in its work cycle. The user specifies the mission path by segments having constant conditions. Performance and cost factors are calculated for each user-selected time increment and summed over the total cycle to determine productivity and unit cost. 730694. Photoelastic Stress Patterns: An Analytical Method for Producing Facsimilies of Experi- mental Results. Joseph J. Stanovsky, University of Texas at Arlington. A piece of glass, bent or strained, produces brilliantly colored patterns when polarized light is transmitted through it. This discovery, by David Brewster, is the essence of the photoelastic method. A discussion of the Stress-Optic Law and its empirical nature is presented as a supporting argument for a modified equation from which photoelastic patterns can be produced by analytical methods. 730695. Designing for Multinational Agri-Machinery. Homer D. Witzel, Deere &amp; Co. Factors which must be considered in designing agri- machinery for multinational markets and manufacture are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of a com- pany's manufacturing the same product in all countries are briefly considered. Then, the requirements essential for successful agri-machinery products in multinational markets are described. 730696. Guidelines for Evaluation of Cab Temperature. Thomas W. Hosier, Deere &amp; Co. A guideline for evaluating the temperature environment of agricultural and industrial equipment cabs is presented. The average cab temperature is compared to the com- fortable, slightly cool, and slightly warm areas on the 1972 ASHRAE comfort chart. A procedure for uniformly determing average cam temperature is outlined. The parameters to consider in a cab heat load calculation are reviewed. This indicates the relative importance of conduction, solar, and infiltration heat loads when designing air-conditioned cabs. 730697. Operation Redesign: Axles and Brakes for MVSS 121. Clarke F. Thornton, Rockwell International. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the detail known to affect the design of axles, brakes, wheels, and related equipment that will be used on air-braked vehicles under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 121. In specific, this paper shows the change that is expected to occur on redesigned axle and braking equipment com- patible with the higher levels of vehicle deceleration and controllability to satisfy the Standard. Variables affecting vehicle brake performance and design and application problems related to MVSS 121 qualification are presented. 730698. Comparative Analysis of Air Brake Antiskid Systems - A Truck Builder's View. Paul A. Turvill, PACCAR, Inc. Numerous air brake antiskid systems, each representing a unique approach to achieving a common goal, are being promoted to fill the market created by the performance criteria contained in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (MVSS) 121. Nine of these systems were examined in order to determine the range of available features and performance, and to discover what new factors will have to be taken into account by vehicle manufacturers to accommodate antiskid systems as standard equipment. The early effective date of MVSS 121 has forced introduction of antiskid systems with only minimal field exposure. The next generation of systems designs is already being considered, and is expected to incorporate refinements based on current experiences of skid control suppliers, vehicle manufacturers, and users. 1973 SA E Transactions 176</page><page sequence="100">730699. Intermixing of Tractors and Trailers Equipped with Existing and FMVSS 121 Braking Systems. G. W. Stearns, Wagner Electric Corp. There are a number of factors affecting the braking stability on tractor-semitrailer combination vehicles when intermixing new and existing braking systems. The changes in the stability of combination vehicles caused by the differences in brake performance levels, brake torque utilization, and brake system response of new and existing systems will be evaluated. The new and the existing systems will be pictorially compared and discussed to clarify the features and performance parameters required on the new equipment which must work in conjunction with pre-FMVSS 121 brake systems. 730701. Machines as Used in the Russian Forest Industry. C. H. Anderson, C. H. Anderson &amp; Associates, Ltd. The Russians have developed a wide range of equipment for the forest industry. This report provides a profile of this general equipment line. The author concludes that the Russian power saws, track skidders and falling machines, trucks, and lower landings offer much in innovative design to American industry. On the other hand, their winchs, spars, and rubber-tired skidders need redesign. 730702. Chain Saw Safety, Vibration, and Noise. Stephen E. Thompson, McCulloch Corp. The chain saw designer tries to protect the logger from three main hazards: cuts and bruises, vibration injury, and hearing impairment. Each of these problems is examined in terms of severity and solution. The availability of field data, as they affect the writing of safety standards and regulations, are also examined. Progress is being made. Chain brakes and special chains have been introduced in an attempt to solve the kickback problem. A number of units meet most existing European vibration standards. Noise levels are still higher than desirable on most models, but muffler development is beginning to reduce exhaust noise toward mechanical noise levels. 730703. Model 200CA Specialized High-Speed Track- laying Logging Vehicle. A. Williams, FMC Corp. The Model 200CA (Choker Arch) high-speed tracklaying logging vehicle was developed by FMC Corp. specifically for the forest products industry. Its function is to haul timber efficiently from stump to landing over all types of terrain and in all environmental conditions. This paper describes the unique features of the Model 200CA and resulting production, silvicultural, and ecological benefits. 730705. California Vehicle Inspections - A Balanced Approach. Donald L. Gibson, Dept. of Cali- fornia Highway Patrol, State of California. California has combined the best features of the random and periodic methods of vehicle inspection in a multi- 730699-730708 pronged attack on the operation of unsafe vehicles. Specially trained personnel of the California Highway Patrol conduct vehicle inspections at random locations throughout the state, at fixed commercial vehicle inspec- tion facilities, and at fleet owners' terminals to ensure compliance with statutory regulations. As a result of this balanced approach, the California motorist is provided with a quality vehicle inspection without economic hardship. 730706. Using Accident Research to Evaluate Periodic Motor Vehicle Inspection. R. W. McMinn, New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles. Periodic motor vehicle inspection is one part of a balanced highway safety program. This paper uses federal safety research data to evaluate inspection and place it in perspective. The evaluation and costs of New Jersey's vehicle inspection system are described. 1973 SA E Transactions 730707. Role of the Nuclear Powerplant - Now and in the Future. Richard L. Sullivan, Portland Gen- eral Electric Co. The current energy crisis in the United States, caused by limitations on existing oil, gas, coal, and hydro resources, will require the construction of many more nuclear powerplants in the future. This paper discusses the operation of one such plant in Rainier, Oregon, and the development of others across the country. Development lead times and siting problems are included. The meeting of future energy needs will require the cooperation of the American people, the utility industry, and government regulatory agencies, all operating within an overall national energy program. 730708. Energy Uses in Transportation - What Does the Future Hold? Lloyd I. Shure, Lewis Research Center, NASA; John T. Milton, Coast Guard Headquarters, U. S. Dept. of Transportation; and James O. Spriggs, FAA, U. S. Dept. of Transportation. In addition to an overview of the Transportation Energy Panel study, the authors present and focus on findings and conclusions of the supporting Heavy Duty Propulsion subpanel. The parent panel on Transportation Energy R&amp;D Goals was directed by the Department of Trans- portation with the participation of NASA and EPA. The report concludes that aircraft could emerge as the dominant user of fuel supplies in the future, that an assured supply of economical JP type fuel will be required beyond the year 2000 as a change in aircraft fuel is unlikely in the foreseeable future, and that accurate prediction of future modal mix and intermodal shifts requires that the total transportation system be modeled. It is particularly the latter that is needed. Inputs to the model would consist of such items for major traffic corridors as current and projected modal capacity re- quirements, network structures, and the efficiency and 177</page><page sequence="101">730709-730715 effectiveness of alternate means of transportation (auto, rail, truck, air, ship). With such a model, investment and development strategies can be worked out for the future. 730709. 1970's Development of 21st Century Mobile - Dispersed Power. Lamont Eltinge, Eaton Corp. A mobile and dispersed power system is necessary for an advanced technological-industrial human society. To- day's is based on petroleum and discharges waste products and heat. It is growing exponentially. Energy resource commitment has already intersected "ultimate" low-cost petroleum supplies in the U.S. and will do so for the world before 2000 A.D.; this portends major changes and cost increases. The 21st Century system for mobile-dispersed power will reflect the energy source selected to replace petroleum - e.g., coal, solar insolation or uranium. It will incor- porate a fuel intermediate such as methanol, ammonia or hydrogen, and a suitably matched "engine". The complete change will require 25 -I- years because of the magnitude, fragmentation, structural gaps, com- plexity and variety of the mobile-dispersed power system. Consequently, substantial, sustained, interacting and coordinated planning, research and advanced develop- ment must be started now and completed during the 1970s. A "system dynamics" model of the resource- fuel-engine-use complex, and a "mixed economy" Energy and Ecology Cybernetics Corp. should be integral parts of the effective management of the unprecedented devel- opment of society's 21st Century mobile-dispersed power system. 1973 SAE Transactions 730710. The COGAS Project - One Method of Coal and Gas Conversion. L. H. Dierdorff, Jr. and R. Bloom, Jr., Cogas Development Co. Coal gasification processes are characterized by a series of general process steps consisting of coal preparation, reaction with steam (or steam and hydrogen) gas puri- fication, shift, and methane synthesis. The chemical reactions involved are simple, but the equilibrium rela- tionships are reasonably complex. A number of these processes have reached the pilot plant stage with two pilot plants in operation. The relative economics can be estimated from heat and carbon utilization efficiencies. The COGAS process development is a privately financed program directed toward production of oil as well as gas from coal using low pressure in the coal conversion steps. This process, which can be applied to a wide variety of coals, consists of pyrolysis of the coal to extract the volatile matter and yield a low volatile char, reaction of the char with steam in a unique gasification step, followed by processing of the oil and gas to product quality. The efficiency of the COGAS process appears to compare favorably with the other processes under development, and its use of low-pressure fluidized-bed processes is expected to have operating advantages. A pilot plant for the COGAS process is under construction. 730712. Less Noise From Diesel Trucks. Richard L. Staadt, International Harvester Co. An indepth study to reduce noise produced by a typical highway diesel truck is being conducted to determine levels and costs attainable by practical means. Truck noise reduction involves isolating several individual noise sources, that is, fan, exhaust, engine-radiated, intake system, and others, and developing means to reduce each. Tire noise and major engine revisions are not considered in this project. Goals of 70 dB(A) (per SAE J366a) without engine enclosure and 75 dB(A) with engine enclosure are believed possible on the vehicle configuration being studied. This project is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Noise Abatement, and industry. 730713. An Engineering Approach To Diesel Truck Noise Reduction. J. W. Thompson, Advanced Products Div., White Motor Corp. This paper describes the White Motor Corp. approach to heavy-duty diesel truck noise reduction. As part of the U.S. Department of Transportation Quiet Truck Program, a unique "free field" stationary vehicle noise test facility was designed and built for noise control development. The features of this facility and the techniques employed in vehicle noise source identification are presented. 730714. The Design of a Cost-Effective Quiet Diesel Truck. Dwight Averill, Freightliner Corp.; and William N. Patterson, Bolt Beranek and New- man Inc. This paper reports the results of a project whose aim was to develop a quiet truck in a cost-effective manner. In the paper a method of approach to identification of noise sources and diesel truck noise control is presented, along with a demonstration of noise control techniques and the results obtained. The final drive-by noise level, as measured by SAE J366a procedures, was 73 dB(A). The approach was to take a standard production truck and modify its exhaust system, fan, transmission, and cab enclosure. Although no modifications were made to the engine, a quieting kit consisting of dampening panels was fitted to it. 1973 SAE Transactions 730715. Measurement and Evaluation of Emissions from a Variety of Controlled and Uncontrolled Light- Duty Vehicles. C. J. Anderson, R. B. Berry, M. E. Gunderson and K. L. Tuttle, Oregon State Univ. This paper on vehicle emissions contains actual data from 19 vehicles, taken with the intent of viewing both emissions and control device deterioration with vehicle age. In addition, valuable insight is given to the value of the 2500 rpm no-load test for emissions. It was found that the 2500 rpm, no load, is not sufficient load and/or engine speed to cause the throttle to open in all cases. The most obvious effective emisson 178</page><page sequence="102">control device observed were those creating a lean air-fuel ratio, retarded spark at idle, and dashpots on the carburetor to stop rapid closing of the throttle on deceleration. These are described in detail. 730716. Modifying a 1971 Toyota Engine for the 1973 Reduced Emission Devices Rally. Glenn Klinger, Oregon Institute of Technology. This paper describes the Oegon Institute of Technology's entry in the 1973 Reduced Emission Devices Rally held in California, one which won first prize for class 2 vehicles. The vehicle was a 1961 Anglia with a redesigned 1971 Toyota internal combustion engine. The engine was converted to use liquefied petroleum gas. The wiring was changed from d-c to a-c because it offered longer spark duration and a turbocharger was added to the LPG fuel system. The modifications resulted particularly in lower carbon monoxide emissions. Details of the vehicle are described. 730717. The University of British Columbia's Urban Vehicle. David Stasuk and Don O'Connor, University of British Columbia. The University of British Columbia was one of 64 schools entered in the 1972 Urban Vehicle Design Competition. This urban vehicle was the Grand Award winner at the competition. The vehicle components and design features which led to the design of a well-integrated urban vehicle are discussed. Details of the engine, chassis, body, electronics, and overall coordination of the project are outlined. The vehicle was built by the students them- selves, starting with a Fiat 128 engine and drive train and natural gas fuel. 730718. Suppression of Vehicle Splash and Spray. Thur- man D. Sherard, Western Highway Institute. Higher average motor vehicle speed, combined with wider and flatter highway pavements, have increased visibility problems for following and passing vehicles traveling on wet or snowy highways. Trucks, because of their size, configurations, and the diameter of their wheels, generally create a larger and denser splash and spray pattern than do most automobiles. Reduced speeds for all motor vehicles on wet or snow covered highways offer an immediate solution to the problem. However, most research and testing to date has concentrated on mechanical devices which can be at- tached to the vehicle. Some of these devices suppress splash and spray but are not practical due to adverse effects created in other important safety or operational areas. 1973 SAE Transactions 730720. Introduction to Caterpillar 3400 Series Engines. D. W. Knopf, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Caterpillar Tractor Co. identifies the truck engine market as a dynamic, demanding opportunity for creative utili- zation of corporate technical, manufacturing, and mar- 730716-730732 keting resources. With the objective of more completely serving the needs of this industry during the balance of the decade, a new family of heavy-duty truck engines is being developed to cover the range of 270-750 hp. Design parameters were formulated to a large extent from a corporate perception of what is possible and practical in the development of diesel engines, from marketing projections of horsepower and operational expectation trends, and from discussions with truck manufacturers for their perception of future requirements. Program objec- tives were established to assure meeting those require- ments. The installation of the 3406 engines, which are in limited production, is shown in various truck models. 730721. Performance and Operational Characteristics of High-Powerèd Diesel Truck Engines. J. J. Farrar and D. B. Stattenfield, Cummins Engine Co. There has been an accelerated growth in power of diesel engines in United States line haul trucking. This paper analyzes the effect of high power on engine-related operating variables that occur under different highway conditions and dissimilar terrain features. When properly applied, high-powered diesel engines can increase average vehicle speed and/or fuel economy. 730722. A Transit Mode Combining the Best of Bus and Rail. Charles F. Whitten and Hilary T. Hornung, Toledo Area Regional Transit Authority. A transit modal concept has been developed which demonstrates good potential as an attractive yet realistic alternative for urban automobile commuters. Called BTV (for Bi-modal Transit Vehicle), the concept consists of rubber-tired automated transit vehicles operating in trains on exclusive guideways. At designated stations, certain of the vehicles are detached and driven manually by transit operating personnel onto surface streets for neighborhood distribution and collection. Urban commuters thus incur no time-consuming intermodal transfer. 730725. Transbus - A Requirement for Urban Trans- portation. K. R. Barnes and J. W. Wetzel, Rohr Industries, Inc. A new urban transit bus design has been developed that demonstrates the latest technological advancements in the automotive engineering world. The three prototypes include many innovative designs for passenger comfort, safety, and aesthetic appeal, among which is a low floor height of 17 in, a special entry ramp for the aged and handicapped, independent suspension for better ride and handling, and improved acceleration, performance, braking, and exhaust emission standards. 730732.

Computer application in engineering is reviewed from an historical viewpoint. Since 1965, a trend toward inte- grating computer programs into a design system has emerged. Such design systems are called "Computer- Aided Design (CAD)" systems. A similar trend in manufacturing is also now emerging. Advanced research and development work in the United States and abroad is directed toward capturing manufacturing logic to develop automated manufacturing systems, known as "Comput- er-Aided Manufacturing (CAM)" systems. It is projected that engineers of the 1970s will witness development of many CAD and CAM systems. It is also projected that a new trend to integrate CAD and CAM systems will emerge in the 1970s. 730734. (SP-384) Metrication - What It Means and Does Not Mean - to the Engineer. J. D. Graham, International Harvester Co. The International System of Units, called SI, is now certain to become our measurement system. It is different from the old metric system in many ways and its proper use is important. It does not involve the sizes of things, or standardization of hardware. International engineering standards present an urgent problem, but a different one, that must not be confused with SI. The costs of changing to metric measurement have been greatly exaggerated and can be minimized by a careful planned approach. 1973 SAE Transactions 730735. (SP-384) The Influence of Product Development on Effective Marketing. William A. Walters, Saab Scania of America. The evolution of the marketing concept is described, with emphasis on the key factors of profits and consumers. Then, marketing mix is explained in terms of profit, pricing, promotion, and placement. The basics of product planning are illustrated by an historical development of the Saab automobile. The creation of the "second- generation" Saab is also described, showing the strategy of phasing in a totally new product to ultimately replace an older product facing a decline in its life cycle, rather than making minor improvements to postpone the decline of the older product. 730736. The United States Passenger Car Population Through 1985. Calvin S. Moore, Ethyl Corp. Current and proposed changes in automotive and related areas make an understanding of the future composition of the domestic passenger car population increasingly im- portant. This paper presents a projected profile of the passenger car population by model year. Much supple- mental data are provided and discussed. Additionally, a discussion of the validity of the results and the techniques employed in the study is included. 1973 SAE Transactions 730737. Power Division by the Omega Drive System. Marvin W. Dundore, Twin Disc Inc. This paper describes the Omega drive power division system consisting of two paths, one a fixed gear train to accessory drives, the other an oil-actuated wet clutch capable of continuous slip under the control of the operator. It covers the following aspects: what the Omega system is, how the Omega valve controls speed, how the Omega clutch is controlled, how the clutch can be slipped continuously, clutch characteristics and requirements, and applications. 730738. Swing Bearing Systems for Cranes and Exca- vators. Bradley A. Pritts, Rotek Inc. Demands for greater capacity per unit size necessitate increasingly careful consideration of mounting structures and fasteners in swing bearing selection. In order that the task be approached as intelligently as possible, this paper brings equipment designers up to date on swing bearing design. Mounting structures, bearings, and fasteners should be considered as an interdependent system to determine design requirements and application limita- tions. Accordingly, different bearing types are discussed and methods for calculating their capacity are presented. A test procedure which is being used to gain additional knowledge of optimum swing bearing system design is outlined. 730739. New Concepts in Design and Development of Hydraulic Crane Booms. Lembit Vaerk, Harnis- chfeger Corp. A new hydraulic boom section has been developed that has optimum weight-to-strength ratio and is economical to manufacture. It is called the "inverted A-frame" section. The "inverted A-frame" section has better resistance to the side loads than the conventional type box section and is torsionally stiffer. Since the main mode of boom loading is bending and web crippling is often a problem, the inverted A-frame section makes it possible to use economical longitudinal stiffeners and thus hold the boom side plates to the minimum thickness. Further, the width- to- thickness ratio of the bottom flange can be regulated so that the steel is used most efficiently in compression. 730744. A Practical Application of Engine Inspection Observations and Used Gas Engine Oil Analysis. O. M. Otte, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co. A used natural gas engine crankcase oil analysis proce- dure has been assembled to provide practical engine controldata for gas engine operators. Originally, this analysis procedure was assembled and used to solve an 180</page><page sequence="104">ashless dispersant lubricant field problem. The analysis procedure, which consists of recognized tests and meth- ods, is also suitable for examining used metallo-detergent or detergent-dispersant lubricants. Data developed by these test methods are consistent, and permit the operator to prepare historical engine charts for additional insight into engine operations and give better correlation between the laboratory evaluation of lubricant and engine obser- vations. By suggesting or predicting the need for engine maintenance, the used oil analysis permits more eco- nomical and reliable operation of gas engines. 730745. Equipment Condition Through Customized Oil Analysis. J. P. O'Hara, A. B. Sarkis and W. A. Kennedy, Mobil Oil Corp. This paper describes the development of an automated and computerized used oil analysis system designed to monitor equipment and lubricant condition. The tech- niques covered are differential infrared analysis, mem- brane filtration, viscosity determination, and analysis of wear metals. The customized used oil analysis is outlined, and field application and case studies described. The system provides an early warning to forestall potential problems and imminent equipment damage, monitors wear and dirt levels, identifies possible deposits and their nature, pinpoints engine conditions causing oil degra- dation, and recommends corrective action. It also reduces laboratory analysis and reporting time for more rapid response to equipment operators. It has proved to be a valuable tool for predictive maintenance. 1973 SAE Transactions 730746. Development and Field Testing of the Mack ESI Engine System. W. R. Alexander, Mack Trucks, Inc. A program was conducted to develop an engine config- uration and lubricant recommendation which would allow a 16,000 mile maintenance period. The program included an engine oil specification based on a multicylinder engine test, lube oil filters, coolant conditioner, cooling system modification, and increased sump capacity. Field tests were conducted. The Mack Extended Service Interval (ESI) system was developed as the result of this program. 730747. Design of Front-End Loaders - Family Concept. Paul H. Whitcomb, Eaton Corp. In order to accomplish the functions of a front-end loader, a unique combination of weight, horsepower, hydraulic power, and structure must be designed into the vehicle. This combination is a function of the volume of the nominal general-purpose bucket and can be designed in terms of "parameters per bucket capacity." Graphs relating the high-performance design to any size loader established the family concept of front-end loader design. 730748. Turbine-Electric Tractor-Trailer Test Rig. D. J. Roesler and L. D. Gaddy, Jr., U. S. Army 730745-730752 Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center. This paper describes and summarizes the tests of an electrically propelled tractor-trailer with power on all axles. The test rig showed superior performance over standard tractor-trailer vehicles of the same size and power on highways, beaches, and hills. It demonstrated that electric propulsion for heavy-duty applications can perform well in on-road and off-road applications. Further, it can be made cost effective by utilizing commercially available electrical equipment. 730749. The Diesel Electric L-700 - A New Concept in Front-End Loaders. Rex L. Zillman, Marathon LeTourneau Co. The Marathon LeTourneau Co. 15 yd3, Model L-700 front-end loader was made possible by effective utilization of an existing diesel electric power system that was specifically modified to suit front-end loader require- ments. The resulting unique combination of electric, hydraulic, and mechanical systems developed for this loader is discussed in this paper. Included in this discussion are: The 700 V, 1200 A d-c propulsion system with traction control, the 300 kW a-c generator circuit with companion hydraulic pump motors, and two individual servo-controlled hydraulic systems, one 350 gpm (1324.75 1) for loading, the other 160 gpm (605.6 1) for steering. Achievement of original project goals has been realized, thus establishing the required precedent for broad acceptance of subsequent vehicles employing the Model L-700's principles of operation. 730750. The Law and the On-Off Highway Truck. Robert Denes, Oshkosh Truck Corp. A brief overview of the effect of the state weight laws (Wisconsin, Indiana, Louisiana, Illinois, California) on the mixer truck axle configuration; a review of design changes necessitated by the federal brake law (FMVSS 121), including the dynamic weight transfer problem; and a look at the expected design changes to attenuate the noise emission of the mixer truck, call for an SAE activity in examining and coordinating the new regulations. 730752. Design and Installation of ROPS for Army Retrofit Program. Paul D. Hopler and William O. Stewart, U. S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center. The U. S. Army is faced with the requirement to provide Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS) on new and old construction equipment vehicles. Many of the commercial design practices can be followed but some military design features and operational conditions pose unusual prob- lems. The large number of vehicles involved and the wide distribution made it necessary to study the problems and ramifications thoroughly for each machine. New tech- niques of design and evaluation had to be developed to cover the major constraints of previously built machines. 181</page><page sequence="105">730754-730769 New design features have been incorporated into the ROPS to simplify shipment, visibility, and retrofit, including refinements on the two-post ROPS, mesh design for falling objects, and mounts. 730754. A 9 yd3 Hydraulic Excavator. H. Heusler and U. Reinecke, Orenstein &amp; Koppel AG (Germany). In 1970, O&amp;K Orenstein &amp; Koppel AG, Germany, introduced one of the largest hydraulic excavators in the world, the RH 60, an hydraulic excavator with a 9 yd3 face shovel, or a 6 yd3 backhoe attachment. The machine proved to be a productive and reliable tool even on field applications unknown for hydraulic excavators before its introduction. Major features of the machine, its basic design, and examples of field applications are discussed. 730755. Design and Application of Skidozer Snowmobile Trail Grooming Equipment. Norman Carpen tier, Bombardier Ltd. Along with the tremendous growth in the number of snowmobiles in use, problems related to ecology and safety have grown. It is no longer possible to use snowmobiles wherever it is convenient and whenever it is enjoyable. Trails specifically designed for the use of snowmobilers are currently being developed. These new trails and areas must be maintained for optimum safety and enjoy ability just as ski slopes are maintained for skiers. Factors affecting the design of trail grooming vehicles are different geographical areas requiring dif- ferent facilities, the financial resources of those groups involved in trail maintenance, and the problem of safety. Bombardier Ltd. has developed and manufactured new tracked vehicles and accessory equipment to groom snowmobile trails effectively and at a reasonable cost. These are described in this paper. 730756. Design and Development of the Kitty Cat Child's Snowmobile. William A. Wood, Arctic Enter- prises, Inc. The design of the Kitty Cat child's snowmobile is traced from the initial concept stage through final production. The concept is taken through three distinct designs, with prototypes constructed at each stage. Objectives were established before finālization, and design parameters were developed. The most important of these, maximum operator safety, is elaborated upon. A broad-range testing program and technical innovations are discussed. Finally, the design of the project itself is treated as an item of special interest. 730761. Dynamic Testing of Tractor Protection Cabs - Development of Method, Practical Experiences. Harald A: son Moberg, National Swedish Test- ing Institute for Agricultural Machinery. A high number of serious tractor accidents in early 1950 made it necessary to develop protection frames or cabs and methods for testing them. Basic studies gave information concerning the strength needed and indicated that a dynamic rather than a static test method would be best. Principles and energy values of these tests are discussed as well as OECD and ISO activities in establishing standards. Swedish practical experiences show a big decrease in fatalities as a result of these studies. 730762. Development and Operation of OECD Tractor Test Code. T. C. D. Manby and J. Matthews, National Institute of Agricultural Engineering (England). The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Devel- opment (OECD) is discussed and compared with other test codes in several countries. It is specifically compared with the Nebraska test codes for tractors. Procedures and requirements are detailed, including retesting, specifi- cations, drawbars, hydraulics, brake performance, noise, etc. The paper concludes that a common test code should be developed and accepted, perhaps under ISO sponsor- ship, to end the difficulties that arise, especially con- cerning power ratings, with the present multiplicity of test codes. 1973 SA E Transactions 730763. Nebraska Tractor Test - Programs and Philos- ophy. W. E. Splinter, G. W. Steinbruegge, D. E. Lane and L. F. Larsen, University of Nebraska. Procedures used at the Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory in testing agricultural tractors are outlined. Tests con- ducted at other test laboratories are compared with Nebraska Tractor Test results. Tests are conducted to determine maximum horsepower at maximum power takeoff, maximum horsepower in operating gears, max- imum pull available from the machine, and noise level at the operator station. These tests showed that a difference of roughly 6% resulted between the testing procedures, which could not be accounted for. It is hoped that this paper can contribute to the coordination of testing procedures at different testing stations, in an effort to improve the tests and to improve the tractor performance. 730768. Articulated Loader Stored Energy Steering Sys- tem. Lanson Becker, General Signal Corp. With the emphasis on safety steering, a steering package has been designed to achieve the safety requirements in a stored energy system. This paper reports the application of an accumulator-unloading valve type of steering system on an articulated loader. The paper concludes that the closed-center steering system exhibits these advantages over an open-center steering system: simplified circuit, potential cost savings, built-in safety steering capability, and improved metering of a closed-center valve. 730769. A Reliability Oriented Approach to the Design of Off-Highway Steering Systems. Darryl Webb, Westinghouse Air Brake Co. 182</page><page sequence="106">Four different off-highway truck hydraulic steering systems with varying complexity are presented. The reliability of each type of system is compared showing the effects of redundancy of components. The importance of system configuration is brought out to offset the adverse effects of a low reliability component. The advantages of a stored energy system in providing an emergency steering capability and in reducing the size of the pump are discussed. 730770. Performance Testing and Criteria for Snow- mobile Seat Cushions. L. R. Schanhals, The Dow Chemical Co.; and Roscoe L. Pershing, Deere and Co. A reliable and practical test method has been developed to measure the dynamic cushioning properties of snow- mobile seats. These cushioning properties are related to probability of spinal injury to man impacting such cushions and minimum performance levels are recom- mended. A review of the dynamic cushioning properties and performance of many snowmobile seat cushions demonstrates the effects of cushion construction on performance. This test method and relation of data to injury probability provides the engineer the tool with which to design safety scientifically into snowmobile seat cushions. 730773. Exterior Sotind Level for Snowmobiles from SAE J 192 to SAE J 192a - Background and Insight. K. F. Nowak, ACS Ltd. The environmental impact of snowmobile noise has received widespread publicity over the past few years. In order to define and solve any noise problem, a satisfactory and repeatable measurement practice must be evolved. In the case of SAE J 192, the particular operating envi- ronment of snowmobiles proves a challenge to this task. Environmental conditions affect not only the propagation of sound at the test site, but also the performance of the vehicle itself. This results in a potential for significant variation in the sound pressure level of the sound source. Hence, the test procedure must be designed so as to minimize if not eliminate such sources of variations. 730779. The Sequence IIC Rust Test Procedure. Richard H. Kabel, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The Sequence IIB rust test procedure did not provide sufficient differentiation among better quality SE engine oils. A new, more severe test, Sequence IIC, was developed to provide the improved differentiation. In general, Sequence IIC results are about one-half rust rating number lower than Sequence IIB results on minimum quality SE engine oils. Sequence IIC results correlate very well with short-trip car data obtained with either leaded or unleaded gasoline. The location from short-trip car tests, conducted with either leaded or unleaded gasoline, are reproduced in Sequence IIC tests using leaded gasoline. In addition, the 730770-730782 procedure has sufficient sensitivity to show performance changes with relatively small changes in additive con- centration. Since the precision of the Sequence IIC procedure approaches that of the CRC rust rating method, improved rust rating techniques must be developed if the precision of the procedure is to be significantly improved. 1973 SAE Transactions 730780. The Effect of Fuel Composition on Lubricant Degradation Rates in a Spark Ignited Engine. M. A. McMahon and K. L. Kreuz, Texaco, Inc. The effect of pure fuels and several mixtures of pure fuels on lubricant degradation rates was determined by burning them in a CLR engine fitted with a Cu-Pb bearing and operated at high speeds and high crankcase temperatures. Oil degradation rates were measured by infrared analysis and the rate of corrosion of the Cu-Pb bearing by oil analysis for copper. Using a typical API-SD SAE 20 grade motor oil, fuels stressed the lubricant in the following decreasing order: disobutylene &gt; isooctane &gt; decene- 1 &gt; hexene-1 &gt; eumene &gt; benzene = tert- butylbenzene &gt;&gt; xylenes &gt; toluene. The lubricant responded to mixtures of these fuels in a manner predictable from the response to pure fuels. The generally low stresses applied to the lubricant by the aromatic fuels may be attributed, at least in part, to the antioxidant action of phenols formed during combustion. No mech- anism was established for the markedly lower stresses observed with the methyl-substituted aromatics. 1973 SAE Transactions 730781. Quality of Hydrotreated Lube Stocks. R. P. Bryer and F. E. Didot, Sun Oil Co. Hydrotreating is a relatively new process to manufacture high quality lube stocks through ring opening, isomeriza- tion, cracking, hydrogen transfer, and other hydrogen reactions. Among the advantages of this process over solvent refining are greater crude flexibility, potentially high V.l. base stocks and increased flexibility in viscosity distribution. The hydrotreated base stocks are manufac- tured to be equivalent to solvent refined stocks and possess the added benefits of higher V.I.s, higher flash points, and lighter colors. In addition, hydrotreated stocks show improved oxidation inhibitor response. This response is seen in engine oils and industrial lubes. In all other respects, hydrotreated stock performance with current additive systems is equivalent to solvent refined stocks in engine oils, automatic transmission fluids, and gear oils. 730782. A Study of Snowmobile Drive Systems. Keni Koteeswara Prasad, Arctic Enterprises, Inc. Snowmobile powerplants are generally highly tuned 2-cycle engines and usually have a narrow band of operation. Depending upon the type of track used and the design of undercarriage, different snow conditions pro- duce different load resistance on the machine. In order to 183</page><page sequence="107">730783-730791 give the operator maximum enjoyment and utility, the snowmobile drive system should perform satisfactorily by delivering optimum power to the track under all envi- ronmental conditions and load demands. In this paper, a study of torque and speed controlled variable ratio V-belt transmission has been performed by analytical and experimental methods. Usefulness and limitations of results obtained by analytical methods are discussed. 730783. Braking Characteristics of the Recreational Snowmobile. James K. H. Kho and James A. Newman, University of Ottawa (Canada). The braking characteristics of three typical recreational snowmobiles have been studied. Of particular interest was the sensitivity of the machines to different applied braking loads. The data were collected using a variable- load braking apparatus and stop-action high-speed pho- tography. The results have been described with an empirical equation. It was determined further that the most effective braking was achieved when the track was locked and this particular behavior has also been char- acterized by an empirical expression. 730785. Hydrostatic Motors - Direct or Indirect? Donald Firth, National Engineering Lab. (Scot- land). The case for hydrostatic drives in off-the-road vehicles has been made by the National Engineering Laboratory and its industrial collaborators and increasingly elsewhere in other parts of the world. Within the fluid power industry, the case, or the argument, for using high-speed motors working through reduction gearboxes - as against direct- drive hydrostatic motors - is still unresolved. The paper examines the pros and cons of the situation and advances the reasons why, at NEL, we incline toward direct hub drive solutions. 730786. Application of Hydrostatic Transmissions to Small and Medium Horsepower Vehicles. James J. Bauer, Clark Equipment Co. Compared with conventional power trains, available axial piston hydraulic pumps and motors provide the designer of work vehicles in the 15-80 hp sizes an opportunity to improve the productivity, reliability, and serviceability of his machine. This paper provides the designer with information frequently overlooked in the initial application of these units. 730787. Hydrofluidic Servos for Industry. R. V. Burton, Honeywell Inc. The increasing use of hydrostatic drives in industry has motivated development of fluidic control devices, using hydraulic oil, for application to hydrostatic transmission pump displacement control. A closed-loop positioning servo using proportional hydrofluidic amplifiers and flowing hydraulic fluid to replace the numerous mechan- ical parts common to conventional servos has been developed. This hydrofluidic servo has been built in both a packaged servoactuator form and a modular form for integration with existing hydrostatic transmission pumps. Operating principles and performance of experimental units are discussed. Operation was evaluated over a 160-500 psig (11-34.5 bar) supply pressure range using fluid viscosities ranging from 220-5 cSt. It was concluded that hydrofluidic servos are practical and that their application in industry will be contingent upon the availability of off-the-shelf components. 730788. European Legislative Requirements for Agricul- tural Tractors and Farm Machinery. Horace F. Howell, Massey Ferguson Ltd. (England). This paper outlines the structure and interrelationships of the numerous European standards making organizations, with particular reference to agricultural machinery. Because many of the standards being developed by these organizations are becoming part of legislation in the various Common Market countries, their work is of great interest to the machinery manufacturers. Covered are the highway code - constructional requirements, safety con- structional requirements, test codes, and engineering standards. The current status of requirements for lighting, tractor cabs (including structural tests, noise, and emis- sions), maximum speed limits, brakes, hitches, and safety in the various countries are discussed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730790. Passenger Car Fuel Economy - Trends and Influencing Factors. Thomas C. Austin and Karl H. Hellman, Environmental Protection Agency. This paper discusses some trends and influencing factors in passenger car fuel economy. Fuel economy and fuel consumption were calculated by a carbon balance method from HC, CO, and C02 emissions measured by the 1972 Federal Test Procedure. The information presented was derived from nearly 4000 tests of passenger cars ranging from 1957 production models to 1975 prototypes. Data are presented for various model year and vehicle weight categories. Trends in fuel economy are discussed on an overall sales-weighted basis and for each individual weight class. Some of the factors that influence fuel economy are quantified through the use of a regression analysis. Particular emphasis is placed on the differences in fuel economy between those vehicles that were subject to federal emission regulations and those vehicles that were not. Three ways to characterize vehicle specific fuel consumption are presented and discussed. Possible ways to improve fuel economy and vehicle specific fuel consumption are also discussed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730791. Factors Affecting Vehicle Fuel Economy. Clayton LaPointe, Ford Motor Co. The recent history of automotive fuel economy in the 184</page><page sequence="108">United States is reviewed. As of the 1973 model year, the typical car on Ford's city-suburban route has experienced a 22% decline in fuel economy compared with 1967. In the aggregate, however, the decline has not been as great because an increasing proportion of small cars has entered the vehicle population. The factors which have contributed to the fuel economy decline of the typical car are average weight and engine displacement increases and measures taken to reduce exhaust emissions. As of the 1973 model year, emission controls have accounted for 60% of the total 22% decline based on Ford's city-suburban route. 1973 SA E Transactions 730792. A North European Tractor Cab. E. Gunnar Ahlstrom, Volvo BMAB (Sweden). A farm tractor protection cab made of thin steel sheet pressings is described. The cab is designed and produced using entirely automotive-type procedures. Curved glasses and a dampening suspension of the glasses are found to be an important means of achieving a low noise level in the cab. Using the pressing technique when producing a steel cab makes it possible to give the various cab details rigidity with a minimum of material. When welded together, these details form a very stiff cab body, which gives the necessary mechanical strength. The curved surfaces, the radii, and the round forms, which from a tooling point of view are natural for pressed steel parts, also have a vibration-dampening effect on the entire cab construction, thus making it easier to design a quiet tractor cab. Mounted on a farm tractor of conventional design, the cab meets the noise rating number ISO N85. 730793. Evaluating Human Exposure to Vibration. J. C. Guignard, University of Dayton. The recent work of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Technical Committee 108, Me- chanical Vibration and Shock, Subcommittee 4 (ISO/TC 108/SC4, Mechanical Vibration and Shock Acceptable to Man) has established guidelines (Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 2631) for the evaluation of human response to whole-body vibration in the range of 1-80 Hz. These guidelines, which are subject to revision and to extension of the frequency range in the light of new and better data, provide a current consensus as to the limits of acceptable human exposure to whole-body vibration in vehicles, buildings, and workplaces, according to selected criteria: comfort, working efficiency, and protection from injury. The limits are expressed in terms of acceleration as a function of direction and frequency of vibration and daily duration of exposure. Other work in hand by ISO/TC 108/SC4 includes the preparation of a similar document covering the special problem of hazards to man due to hand-transmitted vibration in the range 8-2000 Hz from hand-held power tools. This paper briefly reviews and comments on these draft international standards, the 730792-730797 work leading up to their formulation, and their areas of application. The need for further field and laboratory research to provide better supporting data for standard- izing limits of human exposure to vibration is also mentioned. 730795. The Measurement of Tractor Ride Comfort. John Matthews, National Institute for Agricultural Engineering (England). Methods of assessing the ride comfort afforded to tractor drivers by their vehicles and the ride improvement provided by seat suspension are reviewed in relation to information available on the human tolerance to whole- body vibration. Experience with different methods of measurement is reported and a proposal made for the establishment of an internationally agreed method of ride comfort rating based on standardized undulating surfaces over which vibration of the driver's seat is analyzed using frequency weighting to represent the differing sensitivity of the body to different vibration frequencies. 1973 SA E Transactions 730796. Practical and Fundamental Descriptions for Fluid Power Filters. E. C. Fitch and R. K. Tessmann, Oklahoma State University. The multipass filtration performance test which has recently gained industry-wide support offers many fun- damental ways of describing the performance charac- teristics of fluid power filter elements. Some of these descriptions are uniquely qualified to provide the system designer with a practical technique for appraising the capability of filter elements. Important appraisal param- eters of a filter element which must be considered by a designer are particle separation capability, contaminant capacity, and pressure loss. In order to specify a filter element properly for a given application, the requirements for the appraisal parameters must reflect the needs of the system components. A practical and fundamental description for the perform- ance of fluid power filters will incorporate appraisal parameters which can be related to the demands of such system components. This paper relies upon the results of over 70 multipass filter performance tests to illustrate and substantiate the practical and fundamental descriptions presented herein. The filter elements represented by these test results cover a broad spectrum of the filters offered to the fluid power industry today. The interpretation of the test data presented is expressed in terms of basic performance descriptions, which can adequately serve the fluid power industry as appraisal parameters. 1973 SAE Transactions 730797. Solid Contaminant Codes for Hydraulic Fluids. P. J. Wilson, Sperry Vickers European Group. In any hydraulic system, we can, without reservation, say that the cleaner the fluid the better. But, since absolute cleanliness is usually unobtainable, it becomes important 185</page><page sequence="109">730798-730804 that we can readily measure and define the degree of cleanliness in a practical way. Two parameters seem important: number of particles and particle size. In examining hydraulic components as to type and usage, two areas of particle size are of special significance, 5 and 15 micrometres (/mi). By counting all particles in a fluid sample above 5 /xm and also counting all particles above 15 /xm, two indexes are given from which a contaminant profile is derived. The thesis of this paper is that this profile is useful in predicting the performance of specific components with the fluid. 1973 SA E Transactions 730798. Selection of Pumps and Filter Systems Based on Oil Contaminant Levels in an Agricultural Trac- tor. John W. O'Connor, Allis-Chalmers Corp. The use of the Oklahoma State University Pump Contam- inant Sensitive Test, OSU-F2 Multi-pass Filter Per- formance Test, and knowledge of hydraulic fluid con- tamination levels in field tests have proved to be highly effective tools in the development of a reliable hydraulic system for a modern farm tractor. Goals for an improved filter system were: To provide as much filter capacity as economically possible; to increase the filter flow rate; to isolate the pumps from the sources of contaminants. These modifications corrected the problems: Brake friction surfaces which generated less contaminant; a pump with greater contaminant tolerance; an improved filtration system. 1973 SAE Transactions 730799. Electron Beam Welding of Heavy-Duty Trans- mission Components. H. S. Blair and J. A. Hildebrandt, Clark Equipment Co. The conversion from submerged arc welding to electron beam welding (EBW) of transmission components at Clark Equipment Co. is described. The latter system permits the consistent holding of close tolerances and the obtaining of controllable and repeatable metallurgical structures. In addition, control of the weld and distortions is increased, and weld joints are made feasible in otherwise inaccessible locations. A brief history is presented which touches on the selection of transmission products for EBW, choice of EBW equipment, preliminary evaluation, and acceptance of the process by personnel. Then, the application of EBW to production parts is discussed. 730800. Special Performance of Transmission Parts by Shot Peening. John C. Straub, Wheelabrator Frye, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the value of shot peening in reducing production costs where high volume is concerned. Its potential as a means of reducing part size via increased fatigue strength can result in saving material to the extent of hundreds of dollars per day. The significance of the distribution of residual stresses within the shot-peened part is discussed, and theories are presented in an attempt to explain some of the startling effects of shot peening. The economics of efficient operation of peening equipment are discussed, and suggestions are given to minimize operational costs. 730802. Gas from Coal as an Automotive Fuel. J. R. Allsup, Bureau of Mines, U. S. Dept. of the Interior. The Bureau of Mines studied the characteristics of simulated coal gas as an automotive fuel in a multi- cylinder engine in a standard and high compression ratio engine configuration. While using simulated coal gas fuel, increasing the engine compression ratio improved the fuel economy and vehicle performance but increased hydro- carbon emissions by 40%. An oxidizing catalyst used with the simulated coal gas fuel resulted in elimination of all but trace amounts of carbon monoxide and reactive hydrocarbons in the exhaust. Spark gap geometry and firing voltage were varied and within the range tested had little effect on vehicle performance and emissions using simulated coal gas fuel. 730803. Getting Performance without Sacrificing Econ- omy or Emissions Control in a Heavy-Duty LPG Engine. R. A. Mengelkamp and R. E. Linnard, Phillips Petroleum Co. Limited route service experience with a commercial 637 CID conversion of a gasoline engine indicated both its potential and the need for its optimization in order to take advantage of the unique characteristics of liquefied petroleum gas fuels. At the request of the Chicago Transit Authority, an engine-dynamometer study, with emphasis on fuel system-ignition relationships, was conducted at the Phillips Petroleum Co.'s Automotive Labs. Dynamometer studies led to substantial improvement in fuel economy without depreciation of engine power. Cylinder head redesign by the engine manufacturer permitted lean mixture operation that reduced exhaust emission to levels calculated to conform to the 1973 federal standards and 1973-1974 California Air Resources Board requirements for heavy-duty engines. 730804. The Importance of Gaseous Fueled Vehicles. Frederick A. Jennings and Walter R. Studhalter, Environmental Technology and Economy. A large number of vehicles are now running on gaseous fuels. Most are using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and some are using natural gas (NG). Published studies have listed the advantages and disadvantages of such conver- sions, but these have had an unexpected degree of understatement and take a very stringent view of the emission advantage, giving the impression that vehicles using gaseous fuels cannot compete with emission control of the clean gasoline-powered vehicles planned for 1975. This conclusion will probably be proved erroneous when all data are available. As compared to clean 1975 gasoline vehicles, gaseous-fueled vehicles will probably be cheaper 186</page><page sequence="110">to run and more reliable. Disadvantages include limited distribution of gaseous fuels, limited fuel-carrying capac- ity, some regulatory limitations, and a need for more highly developed hardware. Despite these problems, there is a small but important market where conversion will be very profitable for the owner and the community. 730811. Exterior Sound Level Measurement Procedure for Pleasure Motorboats. James W. Mohr, Out- board Maiine Corp. The paper describes how the SAE Marine Sound Level Committee, and representatives of the boating industry, developed a procedure for the standardized measurement f maximum "pass-by" sound levels for pleasure motor- boats up to 65 ft in length. Sound level data for typical boats are presented, as well as the reasons for the procedure and the justification for the tolerances used. The committee's activity resulted in SAE Recommended Practice J34, Exterior Sound Level Measurement Pro- cedure for Pleasure Motorboats. 730812. Development of Sound Level Measurement Pro- cedure for Small Engine Powered Equipment (Report of the SAE Small Engine Powered Equipment Subcommittee). R. L. DeRuyter, Kohler Co. The paper describes work of the SAE Small Engine Powered Equipment Subcommittee in the development of a new sound level measurement procedure for small engine powered equipment. Data were gathered in an effort to improve the test site used in the measurement of exterior sound level of small engine powered equipment such as mowers, riding mowers, garden tractors, snow- blowers, etc. A procedure was developed with a shorter measurement distance and an artificial test surface. The new procedure provides accurate, repeatable sound level data. 730813. Modifying Snowmobiles to Produce Lower Noise Levels. Arthur Lancaster, Cowl Div., James B. Carter Ltd. Commencing with a Canadian Federal Department of Transportation contract to study the feasibility of snow- mobile silencing, the commercial supply of exhaust systems, and the prototyping of representative machines, a considerable amount of data has been accumulated over the past two years in Winnipeg. From this data certain patterns have emerged which we feel provide a basis for developing a pragmatic approach to the problems of reducing the noise level of snowmobiles. 730814. Portable Instrumentation for Monitoring Sound Pressure Levels within the Ear. A. J. Brammer, National Research Council of Canada. The sound pressure levels experienced by an individual exposed to noise can be obtained irrespective of the nature of the source or the presence of acoustic barriers by monitoring the sound field within the ear. The apparatus 730811-730819 developed for this purpose consists of a miniature microphone located on the base of the concha connected to a lightweight instrument package strapped to the subject. The latter contains a modified cassette tape recorder, power supplies, and an oscillator used to record a calibration signal onto each tape and check the performance of the system. A pressure transformation is applied during analysis of the data to compensate for the frequency response of the components or to generate an equivalent sound field that would exist at the center of the head in the absence of the subject. Potential applications of the device include measuring the sound level expe- rienced by operators of machines in use, evaluating the insertion loss of various forms of headgear, and assessing occupational exposures to noise. 730815. Exhaust Port Shapes for Sound and Power. M. B. Johnston, Homelite, Div. of Textron. A theoretical analysis is presented that predicts significant reductions in exhaust pulse amplitudes and hence exhaust noise levels by varying the shape of the exhaust port in a spark-ignited 2-cycle engine. Verification and correlation with experimental results are also presented. 1973 SAE Transactions 730817. Application of Field Loading to Laboratory Power Train Tests. James K. Dunn and Dan D. Lang, John Deere Dubuque Tractor Works. Complete power train assemblies are durability tested in the laboratory by applying real-time, field-recorded axle loads with an electrohydraulic servo system. Transmis- sion shifting is servo-controlled, permitting testing with power shift and power shift-torque converter type trans- missions. The load-control system permits selecting any duty cycle or combination of duty cycles for the laboratory loading. Computer analysis of field and laboratory load data gives a damage rate comparison and component life predictions. A general description of test objectives, equipment, and operation, as well as examples of test results and data comparisons, are given. 730818. Testing of Transmissions. Vernon G. Converse, III, Scans Associates, Inc. Transmissions for off-road vehicles are tested functionally at the end of the production line under conditions which as nearly as possible simulate those of actual use. Pallets are used to obtain high utilization of the testing equip- ment. A check is made of such factors as regulator pressure, lube pressure, drag losses, gear noise, and torque under specific conditions. A description of the testing cycle, methods employed, and readings obtained is included. 730819. Punched Tape Control of Power Shift Trans- mission Test Stands. Robert E. Haight, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works, Deere and Co. A punched tape program is being used to control power shift transmission test stands operating as single or 187</page><page sequence="111">730820-730825 multiple units. Any desired shift sequence (sequence or skip shifting) is available with no concern for rate of shift lever movement, accuracy of detent positions, etc. Trans- mission shifting is accomplished by using electric solenoid valves to control the shift valves. Test unit design and construction, the test controller, test cycle design, test results, laboratory-field correlation, engine, costs, and test stand déficiences are covered. This system provides test flexibility, rapid data acquisition, engine life data, and minimum equipment investment. 730820. Simulation of Farm Tractor Field Loading Through Laboratory Programmed Control. Thomas D. Whelpley, Allis-Chalmers Corp. A unique laboratory system for evaluation of agricultural tractor engines and power trains has been developed which closely simulates field loading, operates on a continuous 24 h basis, and is fully automated to reduce manpower expense. The programming hardware in conjunction with a dynamometer system provides a continuous and efficient method of in-door evaluation which correlates well with results from field test units. A master load histogram produced from collected field data was used to derive an engine loading cycle. A data logging system monitors the test stands during unattended times. Certain shortcomings - lack of reaction to envi- ronmental conditions, geographical differences, an oper- ator's "feel" of a vehicle - will not totally eliminate field testing. 730821. The New Fiat Model 1300 Tractor - Perform- ance, Safety, Comfort. Luigi Ponzio, Agricultural Tractor Div., S.p.A. In the development and finalization stages of a new tractor, it is extremely important to take market require- ments into account. These determine the main charac- teristics of the model: engine power, tractor dimensions, weight, and power train type. In describing the development of the Fiat Model 1300 tractor, the author first explores the requirements of European farmers as opposed to American farmers. Then, calculations used in the determination of the power and weight of the tractor are presented. Next, the advantages of 4-wheel and 2-wheel drive are compared. The choice of engine and transmission for the Model 1300 tractor is explained, and rear tire specifications discussed. Other items such as rockshaft, three-point linkage, and towing devices are also considered, and a detailed description is given of the driver's compartment. 730822. Allis-Chalmers 7030 and 7050 Agricultural Trac- tors. W. R. Bryant, Allis-Chalmers Corp. This paper presents a description of the new Allis- Chalmers model 7030 and 7050 high-horsepower row crop agricultural tractors. The development of the new power train with 20 forward speeds, hydraulic system with 45 gpm output, engine, chassis, and cab has provided the function, safety, performance, convenience, and serv- iceability required in modern farm operations. Several new options have been developed, and other improve- ments have been made, especially at the operator's station. 730823. Evaluating the Vibration and Shock Isolation Qualities of Operator Seats for Construction Machinery. Larry F. Stikeleather, Universal Oil Products Co. Since vehicle seats interact dynamically with the human body, testing the response characteristics of such seats for proper application is important. Likewise, the methods and techniques used for such evaluations are equally important if meaningful results are to be obtained. This paper discusses two quantitative test procedures appli- cable primarily to judging the relative performance of several seats with regard to dynamic characteristics. In particular, the equipment and procedures necessary to plot seat transmissibility are discussed and specific example data are shown for two suspension seats and a static cushion seat. Also, equipment and procedures for assessing the relative dynamic response index (DRI) are discussed and example results for a suspension seat and a cushion seat are included. 1973 SA E Transactions 730824. Operator Seat Design Problems in Reference to Theoretical Vibration Isolation and Practical European Recommendations. J. Huot de Long- champ, Sable Freres International (France). A short survey of the literature about human tolerance to vibrations and about seat transmissibility is presented. A brief summary of European regulations concerning seat characteristics will include not only vibration absorption requirements but also recommended dimensions and necessary adjustments. Safety rules as issued in some countries, in particular for tractor seats, are also discussed. The practical problem of making a seat in accordance with all these factors at a reasonable cost with durability and easy adaptation to the unskilled user will be discussed as a compromise. Conventional systems and new trends are briefly indicated. 730825. A Study of Vibration-Resistant Fasteners. M. B. Pearce, Jr., Loctite Corp. Traditional mechanical methods of preventing fasteners from loosening are now being reevaluated. Consumerism has put a priority on safety and reliability which has triggered a move toward a greater use of locking fasteners. The American National Standards Institute Sub- committee B 18:20 on the performance of locking fasteners is currently drafting performance specifications on chem- ical-locking and free-spinning fasteners. The SAE Subcommittee on Vibration Testing of Fasteners has also begun to screen fastener testing equipment. The author of this paper, actively involved with both groups, offers a preview of locking fastener identification, benefits, and problems; also, fastener performance em- 188</page><page sequence="112">ploying the latest transverse shock and vibration equip- ment, which shows that lock washers do not really lock. 730829. Farm and Industrial Tractors - Emission Trends and Their Impact. G. C. Hardwick and C. R. Hudson, International Harvester Co. The impact of farm and industrial tractors on the total national emissions picture is difficult to assess because the great diversity of uses for these machines results in a wide variation in duty cycles and degrees of utilization. Also, there is a general lack of detailed information on population and population distribution. This paper compares possible farm tractor duty cycle models and concludes that the widely used 13-mode federal heavy-duty diesel engine emissions test cycle can be used to estimate wheel tractor emissions. Estimates then are given for the amount of pollution released by wheeled farm and industrial tractors in 1972, based on the 13-mode cycle and population estimates derived from U.S. Dept. of Commerce, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, and Farm and Industrial Equipment Institute data. Calculations show wheeled tractor emissions con- tribute 3.2% or less of the national total, depending upon the pollutant species. Estimates of the emissions contri- bution of wheeled tractors in concentrated urban areas in California and Illinois show an even lower effect, constituting 0.6% or less of the total mobile source emissions. 730830. Impact of Emissions from Farm Equipment and Off-Road Heavy Duty Equipment on Air Pol- lution in California. M. Van Loan, Automotive Environmental Systems, Inc.; and Larry Res- nick, California Air Resources Board. As control strategies for both mobile and stationary sources have been implemented and have become effec- tive, they have caused a significant reduction in Cali- fornia's air pollution problem. New strategies are focus- ing on heretofore uncontrolled emissions sources. The California Air Resources Board has supported a study to assess the current and future significance of currently uncontrolled mobile and semimobile sources of emissions powered by internal combustion engines. The two primary goals of the study were to develop an emissions inventory for those emissions sources in California not presently controlled by existing legislation and regulations and to make an accurate determination of the contri- bution of these sources to California's total air pollution problem. This paper focuses upon the results of the ARB-sponsored study as it relates to farm and off-road heavy-duty equipment. It includes the estimation of vehicle and equipment populations, horsepower and engine types, growth trends, and various other relevant characteristics associated with the uncontrolled emissions sources for the State of California. 730831. Versatile Single-Cylinder Diesel Test Engine for Lubricant, Emissions, and Fuel Research. J. R. 730829-730834 Griffin, Chevron Research Co.; and H. L. Wittek, List-Rosen-Wittek Associates Inc. Laboratory development of modern diesel engine lubri- cants should ideally be done at the high output/speed conditions where the latest engines operate. In the late 1960s, the only engine available to the oil industry were the Caterpillar 1Y73 and the Petter AV-1. While useful test tools, neither of these engines can successfully operate at the desired conditions. Nor can they be successfully modified for that purpose. For these reasons, a joint project was established in 1969 between Chevron Research and List-Rosen-Wittek/ AVL. Its purpose was to adapt one of the AVL diesel development engines to lubricant, emission, and fuel research. The design criteria developed included modern speed/output capability, durability, low maintenance, special lubrication features, adaptability, and balancing. These requirements resulted in a completely new design. A prototype was constructed, and this engine ran in October 1972. The design features are described and illustrated. The engine is now being installed in the Richmond Laboratory of Chevron Research Co. 730832. Chassis Dynamometer Evaluation of Vehicle Cooling System Performance. Richard B. Jan- kowski, Clark Equipment Co. A look at a chassis dynamometer installation, including the peripheral equipment necessary for vehicle cooling system evaluation, is presented. Also covered at the procedures, specifications and instrumentation used in conducting such a test. 730833. Industrial Lift Truck Capacity Limiting System. George A. Ekstrom and Michael R. Young, Eaton Corp. The Eaton Capacity Limiting System (CLS) was develop- ed for use on counterbalanced lift trucks to prevent abuse of these trucks as a result of overloading. The heart of the system is a hydraulic valve termed the "overload control valve". This valve reacts to the magnitude of the load moment acting on the truck rather than merely the magnitude of the load. The load moment is defined as the mathematical product of the force exerted by the load and the horizontal distance between the front axle centerline and the vertical projection of the load center of gravity. When the load moment exceeds a predetermined allow- able magnitude, the valve prevents further lifting or forward tilting of the mast. 730834. The Effect of Unleaded Fuel Composition on Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emissions. H. K. Newhall, R. E. Jentoft and P. R. Ballinger, Chevron Research Co. Three cars have been operated for approximately 8000 miles on each of four unleaded gasolines. These gasolines encompassed varied levels of C6-C8 aromatics and varied polynuclear aromatic (PNA) content. Exhaust PNA 189</page><page sequence="113">730835-730840 emissions and lube oil PNA content were measured periodically during the course of mileage accumulation. Results of this study show that increases in both light C6-C8 fuel aromatics and fuel-contained PNAs can result in significantly increased exhaust PNAs. Vehicles meeting increasingly stringent hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions standards emit greatly reduced quantities of exhaust PNAs, though the rate of lube oil PNA accumulation appears to be unaffected by emissions control systems. Accumulated lubricating oil mileage was found to&lt; correlate with increased PNA emissions with a high level of statistical significance. This may be the result of an observed increase in lube oil PNA content with mileage accumulation. Oil change was found to result in an immediate reduction in PNA emissions. 730835. Mechanisms of Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocar- bon Emissions from Automotive Engines. J. L. Laity, M. D. Malbin, W. W. Haskell and W. I. Doty, Shell Development Co. Mechanisms that influence emissions of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNA) from engines have been investigated with an on-line fluorescence PNA detector. PNA can accumulate at the surfaces and within the deposits of a combustion chamber, and some of these PNA are vaporized during engine operation. Increased heat input to established combustion chamber deposits (for example, from increased spark advance, knock, or high-speed operation) enhance PNA emissions, at least temporarily. At several steady speeds, PNA emissions were com- pared, using a rotary engine vehicle and a similar car with a reciprocating spark ignition engine. With the emission control system disabled, the rotary engine automobile exhibits very high PNA emissions relative to the piston engine. However, exhaust emission control devices, such as the thermal reactor on the rotary engine car, can be highly effective in destroying PNA. 1973 SA E Transactions 730836. Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Vehicle Exhaust Gas. N. Zaghini, S. Mangolini, M. Arteconi and F. Sezzi, SNAM PROGETTI (Italy). Evidence is presented to determine the relationship between fuel composition and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNA) formation. Emission rates of PNA were determined for gasoline engines in simulated city driving; in order to confirm the results, experiments were carried out with a vertical flow reactor. The PNA emission was found to depend on the different aromatic hydrocarbons present in the fuel. The addition of tetraethyl lead (TEL) to gasoline had little effect on PNA emission. The carcinogenic hydrocarbons like 1.2 benzanthra- cene and benz(a)pyrene, particularly associated with the more carbonaceous part of the soot, are preferentially deposited on the combustion chamber walls, as pointed out from vertical reactor experiments. 730838. Transmission System Analysis for Varied Tasks. Thomas W. Baehler, Twin Disc Inc. The procedures used by Twin Disc in the design and application of a combined torque converter-powershift transmission systems are described. In conjunction with digital computers, these procedures provide data on specific power train proposals which are then compared with known values of acceptable and unacceptable data for clutch design, vehicle acceleration, deceleration, jerk, and vehicle response. 730839. Shift Modulation of Allison Automatic and Powershift Transmissions. K. B. Harmon and R. H. Schaefer, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., Gen- eral Motors Corp. The need for continuous and smooth power flow during shifting of power shift and automatic transmissions has long been recognized. In addition, over the years, vehicle users have demanded continuing transmission improve- ment in such areas as shift quality, clutch durability, overspeed protection, and performance. The factors - clutch size, clutch coefficient variation, gear ratio step, and clutch apply pressure characteristics - which influence shift quality (or smoothness) have been identified. Compensation for the first three of these can be achieved by controlling the fourth, the clutch apply pressure characteristics, by means described as clutch capacity modulation. A fifth factor which has an influence on shift smoothness in automatic transmissions is the proper scheduling of range shifts with respect to vehicle speed, engine speed, and engine throttle position. Several methods of shift point modulation have been developed, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. 1973 SA E Transactions 730840. Surface Finish Requirements of Spacer Plates for Paper Friction Applications. Robert L. Fish and Frederick A. Lloyd, Jr., Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc. Paper type friction materials can be used to provide higher dynamic coefficient and better engagement characteristics in wet application, but the softer structure of these products necessitates care for the surface condition of the mating spacer plate if optimum durability is to be obtained. This report covers methods of studying surfaces and relating the observed finish to durability obtained under special dynamometer test conditions. A variety of surface preparations have been investigated including rolled, tumbled, ground, and sanded finishes. Friction material durability was studied as a function of mating plate preparation, roughness, surface profile, and hard- ness. Relative sensitivity to mating surface of various paper friction formulations is provided. Acknowledging the limitations of the present state-of-the-art, an attempt is 190</page><page sequence="114">made to define spacer requirements for use with these types of friction materials. 730845. Small, High-Speed, Air-Cooled Diesel Engines for Military and Industrial Applications. James P. Arnold, U. S. Army Mobility Equipment Re- search and Development Center, Fritz Freyn, Bruno Schukoff and Gerhard Thien, Anstalt fur Verbrennungsmotoren (Germany); and Edwin C. Kienzle, Hercules Engine Div., White En- gines, Inc. The military requirement for a lightweight, air-cooled compression ignition engine family having two members, specifically 10 and 20 hp versions at the rated speed of 3600 rpm, is discussed in this paper. Design and preliminary development programs for such an engine family have been completed, and specifics are related. Development of a practical combustion system for the high rated speed was found to be feasible and is demonstrated on the basis of test data. Endurance data to date indicate that the design life of 6000 h between major overhauls will be attainable. The plan for the future includes additional testing of updated prototype engines as well as further investigations in the areas of noise reduction and control of harmful exhaust emissions.

Paul Patchen and Larry Ruud, Allis-Chalmers Corp. This paper describes the new 3000 Series MK II engines and their application in the Allis-Chalmers 7030 and 7050 farm tractors. This includes performance, reliability, noise reduction, and economy of operation to meet the environmental and performance specifications established for these farm tractors. Improvements were made to the cylinder block, cylinder sleeve, piston and ring, crankshaft and flywheel, water and oil pumps, cylinder head, exhaust manifold, lube oil cooler and filters, and intercooler and turbocharger (depending on the engine model). Endur- ance tests at full speed ovdr fueling, load cycle testing, and field testing were conducted. 730847. Reliability and Military Construction Equipment. Arthur B. Follansbee and Lyn wood M. Rabon, U. S. Army Mobility Equipment R&amp;D Center. Because reliability is an integral part of military planning and has tremendous impact on operations and logistics, explicit reliability requirements have recently become part of many specifications used by the U.S. Army for procuring construction equipment. Reliability is discussed in the context of construction equipment, particularly the difficulty in obtaining data, defining failures, and the risks involved in demonstration tests. The successful appli- cation of reliability requirements in military specifications depends on a coordinated effort between industry and 730845-730852 government working within commonly understood mean- ings of reliability and its ramifications. 730849. Reduction of Noise from Construction Machines with Particular Reference to Cooling Systems. N. J. Stephenson and I. D. A. Thomas, Perkins Engines Co. (England). It has been found that on many conventional construction machines, the cooling system is the major noise source. Design parameters for quiet and efficient cooling systems are explained; they show the importance of matching the various elements of the system. It is illustrated that, in practice, very minor changes to cooling systems to improve the match, coupled with other fundamental noise reduction techniques, can result in considerable reduc- tions in noise. Reference is also made to possible future trends in minimizing cooling system duty by use of new materials to reduce engine heat rejection. 730850. REDSOD - Techniques and Performance. Charles D. Wood, Southwest Research Institute. Circumstances and results of tests of a three-chambered REDSOD built for attachment to a Caterpillar D9 tractor are discussed. The Caterpillar D9 tractor was chosen for its drawbar capability of 4000 lb/ft of width, bare weight of approximately 70,000 lb, and 10 ft width. Tests in straight trenching operations were performed at two sites: one in an area with a clay overburden, the other in sand. From the data presented, it is concluded that a REDSOD machine, with a 1200 ft3 min air compressor, handled by a skilled operator, can produce a 2 ft deep trench at approximately 2000 yd3/h. The noise level is not damaging to operator or adjacent structures or personnel. The use of higher air pressures increases production rates. The recoil produced by REDSOD has no appreciable effect on production rate or tractor reliability. 1973 SA E Transactions 730851. An Evaluation of the REDSOD Concept Based on Model Tests in Soil. Ernest T. Selig, State University of New York at Buffalo. Laboratory model studies were conducted to determine the basic principles controlling performance and to assess the capabilities of a new concept of earthmoving known as REDSOD. Nondimensional empirical equations for ex- cavated crater volume and equipment recoil force derived from the model tests showed reasonable agreement with full-scale field test results. Estimates of trenching pro- ductivity were made for the REDSOD using these equations, and the results were compared with estimates for conventional earthmoving equipment. 1973 SA E Transactions 730852. A System for Increasing the Rock Fracturing Capability of a Ripping Tractor. John W. Col- burn, Jr., Southwest Research Institute. A system has been developed which fragments rock by 191</page><page sequence="115">730853-730858 high-pressure gas discharges near the point of ripper penetration of a rock formation. From development tests, it was demonstrated that the system markedly extends the rock fracturing performance of a D7 Caterpillar tractor. The paper is divided into three basic sections. First, a summary of the mathematical analyses and model testing of rck fracturing is presented. Next, the hardware design and development necessary to adapt the FARE principle to rock-ripping requirements is described. Finally, the results and evaluations of tests conducted at various limestone rock test sites are described. 1973 SAE Transactions 730853. Technical Analysis Study of Off-Road Tires. Wesley S. Trindal, U. S. Army Mobility Equip- ment R&amp;D Center. The major problems and some of their solutions in the application of pneumatic tires, principally off-road tires, to vehicular equipment are explored. Variables attributed to the user's operation, his equipment, and the off-road tires are considered in detail. Topics of standardization, abuse, mobility, and ton-mile-per-hour are included. Also discussed is the industry's need for a common vocabulary. 730854. A Tire Must - In-House Prove Design Testing. C. C. Sons, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The purpose of this paper is to focus attention on the earthmover tire problem, why it exists and what must be done to bring the tire up to the operating capability of the rest of the machine. As the machine has been improved, it has become increasingly apparent that the rate of progress in devel- opment of earthmover tires has lagged behind that of the rest of the machine. The current rate of investment in research and development within the industry ensures that even greater problems can be expected in the future as a result of limitations which must be placed upon tire performance. The methods employed in rating earthmover tires are not adequate, in view of the many variables encountered at the user's job site. The addition of the tmph rating system is helpful, but is not a total answer. The Tire and Rim Association's rating system is discussed. The need for in-house test capability in the form of "dynamome- ters" is only too apparent from an examination of failure records taken from user's job sites. In-house test facilities are the key to future success in the earthmover tire industry. 730855. Recommended Practice for Tire TMPH Appli- cation. R. M. MacFarland, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. To insure that all components of new design haulage vehicles can function to produce the daily work require- ment, it is necessary to consider the specification limits of these parts. Tires have a specification limit called ton-mile/hour (tmph). The use of this tmph tool as well as the Tire &amp; Rim Association load tables, in the initial design of new vehicles, is important to make sure that the tire's structural limits are not exceeded. The use of job tmph requirements in the field as a basis for tire selection will make certain that downtime due to tire heat problems will be minimal. There are limits in both load and speed for the use of the tmph concept which must be considered as well as the conditions of ambient temperature. The SAE has recognized the use of tmph ratings, and will publish tire test standards and recommendations in the SAE Handbook. 730856. Earthmover Rim and Wheel Development. Rich- ard L. Williams, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. A brief history is traced of the stages of development of earthmover rims and wheels. Tubeless earthmover ter- minology, mountings, applications, and safety tips are discussed. The information is intended primarily for the use of the vehicle designer and the end user of earthmover rims and wheels. 730857. Emission Characteristics of Small Industrial Engines. John B. O'Sullivan and William A. Summerson, U. S. Army Mobility Equipment R&amp;D Center; and John A. Russell, U. S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Research Lab. The emission characteristics of small industrial engines have not been as thoroughly documented as those used in vehicular applications. This paper presents emission data obtained for a variety of engines, under 1200 hp, primarily used for Army field power generation. A more limited presentation concerns the effects of fuel composition on emissions. In general, the emissions from gasoline engines used in generator set applications are much higher than they would be in other uses. They are operated on the rich side to enable rapid response to load transients. Emission variability from engine to engine appears to mask out any major trends with engine size that might be observed. This variability as well as variance in test replication also masks out any changes that might be observed as a result of varying fuel composition. 730858. Exhaust Pollution Minimization in Small Engines Using Adaptive Digital Control. John K. Rehres, U. S. Army Tank- Automotive Command; and John J. Allan, III, The University of Texas at Austin. Advances in digital computer technology have brought the application of on-line digital control systems to bear on the problem of exhaust gas pollution from the internal combustion engine. One application, adaptive digital control of fuel consumption based on a feedback of an analysis of exhaust gases, is explained. A small gasoline engine is modified with a fuel injection system, thus the engine, digital computer, and gas analyzer interface is developed. The engine's exhaust pollutants, based on real time operating conditions, are minimized while per- formance is retained. 192</page><page sequence="116">The delay time limitations experienced by the feed- back transducer are demonstrated by a transient mode of operation. The relevance of this investigation and some future applications are discussed. 730859. Small Engine Emissions and Their Impact. Charles T. Hare and Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute; William Rogers Oliver and William H. Houtman, Environmental Protection Agency. In an attempt to characterize emissions from small air-cooled utility engines, five gasoline-fueled models were operated over a variety of speeds and loads, and important exhaust constituents were measured. These emissions included hydrocarbons, CO, C02, NO, 02, aldehydes, light hydrocarbons, particulates, and smoke. Emissions of SOx were estimated on the basis of the fuel consumed; evaporative losses of hydrocarbons were also estimated. The impact of small engine emissions was calculated on the basis of the test results and information on national engine populations and usage. From these data, it appears that the 50 million or more small engines currently being used account for only a small part of pollutants from all sources.

Load-Sensitive Hydraulic System for Allis- Chalmers Models 7030 and 7050 Agricultural Tractors. Ramkishan Khatti, Allis-Chalmers Corp. A new and unique load-sensitive hydraulic system is now available on the new Allis-Chalmers Models 7030 and 7050 agricultural tractors. Although the system is con- sidered very efficient and effective by experts, use of the system has been limited in the mobile equipment industry. This paper highlights the application of the load-sentive circuit in the A-C 7030-7050 tractors. The circuit combines the advantages of the two basic types of systems used in tractors - fixed flow (open-center) and variable flow (constant-pressure, closed-center) - and avoids their major disadvantages. 730861. Allis-Chalmers Power Trains for Model 7030 and 7050 Agricultural Tractors. Donald W. Long- shore and Joseph R. Hoepfl, Allis-Chalmers Corp. Allis-Chalmers has introduced a new family of tractors for 1973 in the 130-155 hp (96-116 kW) class. The unique design and development aspects are presented for the entire power train system - Power Director transmission, range transmission, park lock, differential and differential lock, brakes, final drive, and independent PTO. Dura- bility, performance, low noise emission, safety, and convenience of operation were the key objectives. 730859-730873 730862.

Durability of planetary final drive gearsets for use in large agricultural tractors can be enhanced by modifying gear tooth profiles, adding sufficient rigidity to the system, and floating at least one of the members. Properly applied to the design, these procedures may also reduce the need for close manufacturing tolerances. Their application was instrumental in providing a successful planetary final drive design for the Allis-Chalmers Models 7030 and 7050 agricultural tractors. 730863. Design and Development of Wet Disc Brakes for Agricultural Tractors. David C. Quick and Lloyd F. Sippel, Allis-Chalmers Corp. A multiple wet disc braking system has been developed for the Allis-Chalmers Models 7030 and 7050 agricultural tractors. An extensive test program was developed, numerous friction materials were tested, and laboratory testing supplemented tractor testing so that all factors could be evaluated. The multiple disc brake shows promise for greater tolerance in the selection of friction materials to solve such braking problems as noise, fade, energy capacity, and torque capacity. 730864. An Optimization Scheme for Designing Two- Dimensional Backward-Curved Centrifugal Fans. M. L. Kaesser, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works; and P. D. Scholz, The University of Iowa. A procedure is presented for optimizing the design of two-dimensional, backward-curved, relatively low cost centrifugal fans to operate at maximum efficiency per- mitted by the speed and space requirements. The procedure utilizes an optimization map that is based on an analysis which reduces the variables by geometrical constraints and empirical values. The empirical values and much of the analytical treatment are based on experimental studies and the literature on centrifugal fans, pumps, and compressors. Some of the geometrical rela- tionships are chosen to simplify fabrication without seriously jeopardizing fan performance. 1973 SA E Transactions 730873. Reducing Construction Equipment Cooling Sys- tem Noise to Meet the French Noise Require- ment. R. L. Mann, J. I. Case Co. A major noise source on construction equipment is the cooling system when tested according to the French Noise Test Procedure. This paper describes the procedure and methods used to reduce economically the Case 580B CK loader-backhoe cooling system noise to 70 dB(A), well below the French limit of 80 dB(A) for the whole vehicle, and remain within the desired physical and performance constraints. This was accomplished primarily by reducing fan speed and 193</page><page sequence="117">730874-730881 using a larger capacity radiator to maintain adequate cooling. 730874. Hydraulic and Mechanical Factors Affecting Pump Airborne Noise Measurements. G. E. Maroney and L. R. Elliott, Fluid Power Re- search Center, Oklahoma State University. Satisfactory control of fluid power system noise is dependent upon accurate knowledge of component noise levels. One component which contributes to the total system noise level is the hydraulic pump. There are test methods available for measuring and reporting airborne pump noise. However, these test methods need to be carefully examined to insure that proper constraints are placed on the various hydraulic and mechanical factors which affect the accurate measurement of pump airborne noise. This paper describes the major hydraulic and me- chanical factors that affect the measurement of pump airborne noise. Experimental data are presented to illustrate the variation that can result due to such factors as the pump mount, fluid lines, and the drive shaft. Techniques for reducing the variation due to these factors are presented for the reader's consideration. 1973 SAE Transactions 730875.

New Airfoil Sections for General Aviation Air- craft. William H. Wentz, Jr., Wichita State University. A program has been undertaken to develop new airfoil sections suitable for general aviation aircraft, utilizing theoretical and experimental advanced technology devel- oped in recent years primarily for subsonic jet transport and military aircraft. The airfoil development program is one component of the Advanced Technology Light Twin (ATLIT) program sponsored by NASA Langley Research Center. Two-dimensional tests of a new airfoil at NASA and Wichita State University have demonstrated high cruising performance over a fairly wide C{ range, and a Cjmax value of 3.69 with Fowler flap and no leading-edge devices. Experimental and theoretical development of additional configurations is underway. 1973 SAE Transactions 730877. Economic Considerations in Maintenance Pro- gram Development. Burton L. Terrell, Delta Air Lines, Inc. An aircraft maintenance program can be one of the most valuable economic tools available to a commercial air transport operator. It is the area that offers management the most opportunities to control costs. Current com- mercial aircraft design plus recent regulatory changes have combined to place an increasing burden on man- agement, accompanied by the potential for an increasing economic return. 1973 SAE Transactions 730878. Spray Cooled Generators and Design-To-Cost at Westinghouse. A. E. King, Aerospace Electrical Div., Westinghouse Electric Corp. A totally integrated design-to-cost program was under- taken at Westinghouse to derive a basic, standardized line of spray oil-cooled generators having optimized per- formance and maximum reliability over a wide range of output ratings and customer applications. The devel- opment of the spray cooled generators resulted in unique design configurations that also warranted development of new manufacturing facilities. 730880. Aerospace Fluidics Applications and Circuit Man- ufacture. T. G. Sutton, Sr. and W. J. Anderson, AiResearch Manufacturing Co., Div., Garrett Corp. The application of fluidics to the solution of aerospace control problems began at AiResearch in 1964. Several development programs have resulted in production appli- cations related to the major AiResearch product lines which include gas turbines, propulsion engines, air motors, and environmental control systems. Early in these development programs, it was realized that the manufacture of monolithic flueric circuits would be necessary for aerospace use of this new technology. Research and investigation of production processes resulted in the use of photochemical machining and activated diffusion bonding for production and devel- opment fluidic circuitry manufacture. The use of these processes has lead to the successful application of fluidics to aerospace products. 730881. Maintainability Concepts Used in the Design and Operation of Douglas Commercial Jet Aircraft. J. M. Bandy, Delta Air Lines, Inc. In the past few years, maintenance costs have risen only about half as fast as the other components of operating cost. The evolution of maintenance philosophy and maintainability concepts are prime factors which have permitted this degree of control of maintenance costs, in spite of rising wages and material prices. 194</page><page sequence="118">This paper explains the maintenance philosophy at Douglas Aircraft and gives examples relating to the DC-8, DC-9, and DC- 10. The three methods of maintenance control - Hard Time, On Condition, and Condition Monitoring - are described, and statistics of Delta Air Lines maintenance provided to illustrate their effective- ness. 730882. Avionics Design for Maintainability - Are We Gaining or Losing? T. A. Ellison, United Air Lines. An overview of avionics maintainabilixy, as indicated from airline operating statistics, shows improvement in some elements and degradation in others, but a slowly degrading overall trend. Maintainability elements and trends are identified and discussed. Principal problems are the shop labor expended for the high proportion of removed equipment found to be in satisfactory condition, and the increasing line mainte- nance effort required by wide-body aircraft. Built-in test equipment (BITE) or monitoring within the system, if properly designed, appears to be a good approach to improve this situation. Design guidance for effective BITE or monitoring objectives is provided. 1973 SA E Transactions 730883. L-1011 Upkeep. W. H. Spannuth, Trans World Airlines, Inc. The question has been asked whether the airline industry is gaining or losing in the design of new aircraft for maintainability. The Lockheed L-1011 aircraft is exam- ined by an operator resulting in two answers: yes - for routine maintenance: and no - for nonroutine mainte- nance. Areas for investigation for further improvement, particularly in the wide-body aircraft, are in the care of passenger cabin and associated appliances and amenities. The airlines have hurt themselves, maintenance-wise, by brightening up the interiors - trading dark colors, which do not show abuse, for the lighter, more attractive colors. The same principles and criteria need to be applied to cabin interior design as have been used to develop the reliable structures, systems, and powerplants now in operation. 730884. Material Selection Procedures for Advanced Transport Aircraft. J. M. Shults, Convair Aero- space Div., General Dynamics Corp. This paper will discuss the procedures used for material selection that were developed and used for two Advanced Metallic Structures, Advanced Development Programs (AMS/ADP) sponsored by the Air Force Flight Dynam- ics Laboratory (AFFDL) under joint management and direction of AFFDL and the Air Force Materials Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The relationship of structural properties and the role of fracture mechanics in material selection are covered. The application of the selection criteria is demonstrated as it 730882-730888 was applied to the Advanced Metallic Air Vehicle Structure. 730886. Wing/Fuselage Structural Concept Study for a Subsonic Transport Aircraft. George V. Deneff, Douglas Aircraft Co. Results of a brief study program to devise and evaluate new structural materials and concepts for a subsonic, transport-type aircraft are presented. Comparisons of several wing concepts to the state-of-the-art baseline concept indicate a weight saving of 10%, but with corresponding total cost increases of 50-75%. One fuselage concept indicates a 7% weight saving with a 5% total cost saving. Corresponding aircraft performance payoffs with and without resizing are also established. The overall payoffs are somewhat nominal, based on the new concept impact on participating structure only. Both baseline and new concept analyses are based on a common set of requirements for ultimate strength, fatigue life, damage tolerance, and flutter rigidity. The study is directed to metallic concepts. 1973 SA E Transactions 730887. Advanced Structural Materials Application for High-Subsonic-Speed Transports. R. H. Lange and L. W. Lassiter, Lockheed-Georgia Co. This paper describes the results of parametric design studies of the application of filamentary composite materials in the structure of high-subsonic-speed transport aircraft. System costs and weight savings are presented as a function of percent utilization of composite materials from zero to 80%. The weight savings potential of composites for direct material substitution and for resized aircraft show gains of up to 25 and 50%, respectively. The state-of-the-art in structural design, analysis, fabrication, and test is discussed. Structural design concepts are shown and test validation is given, along with cost analyses. 730888. Influence of Prototype Concept and Cost Ceilings on Airframe Design and Manufacture of the YF-16 Light-Weight Fighter. W. C. Dietz and W. K. Bailey, Convair Aerospace Div., General Dynamics Corp. The YF-16 lightweight fighter prototype program con- tracted by the U.S. Air Force(USAF) in April 1972 established a dollar ceiling on the design, manufacture, and test of two prototype aircraft, and also established a flyaway cost goal for production aircraft should the USAF elect to procure the aircraft for its force structure. With cost as a factor coequal with performance, innova- tive design features were incorporated in the basic configuration during preliminary design to minimize the size, weight, and cost of the aircraft, yet meet the desired performance goals. Simplicity and elimination of unessen- tial features were also given primary consideration. The execution of the detail design, tooling, and manufacturing program was oriented toward low cost 195</page><page sequence="119">730889-730894 concepts and rigorous adherence to established budgets. Multiple use of parts and assemblies, use of low cost materials, and standardization of hardware items con- tributed to low tooling and manufacturing cost. Reduc- tion in the cost of development and qualification tests was achieved by designing with additional margins of safety to avoid extensive testing and to permit flight demonstration up to design limits. A simplified direct program man- agement approach was taken which incorporated unique features for program and cost control in consonance with the limited two-aircraft prototype program. 730889. Decision Making in Preliminary Design. Carl Gottwald, Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical. A decision tool utilizing the magnitudes of system parameters and an associated set of weighting factors has been developed to compare alternative design concepts for new systems. The weighting factors are computed from data describing the system requirements, and they are not assigned a priori. The magnitudes for the system param- eters and the weighting factors are combined in a new, unique manner, not by direct multiplication. Both of these operations can be implemented on a computer; consequently, alternative design concepts can be com- pared rapidly in the presence of and in response to changing system requirements. This decision tool is primarily for use during the preliminary design phase of a system. 730890. The Influence of Design to Cost and Prototyping on the A- 10 Aircraft. Walter B. Trepei and George A. Bohmann, Fairchild Republic Co., Fairchild Industries, Inc. Increasing concern has been shown at all levels of government over the rising cost of major weapons systems. The implementation of the "design to cost" approach is intended to reverse this trend by placing greater emphasis on the cost elements during systems design and by restraining the natural desire for maximum performance if the technology required involves the risk of cost escalation. These factors, however, must not detract from the basic goal - the production of a weapons system with acceptable, reliable performance within cost guide- lines. The application of design to cost and the effect of prototyping are described as they apply to the A- 10 close air support aircraft. 730891. Application of Advances in Structures and Ma- terials to the Design of the YF-17 Airplane. R. D. Hayes, Northrop Corp. A review of the structural design and material selection in the YF-17 airplane is presented. Emphasis is placed on the choice of those design concepts and materials that are unique, and the effect on these choices of the prototyping philosophy is described. Special emphasis is placed on the use of graphite materials, but the use of other nonmetallic materials and the considerations involved in the selection of metallic alloys and heat treatments are also discussed. 730892. Control of Helicopter Vibration Using the Dy- namic Antiresonant Vibration Isolator. Robert Jones, Kaman Aerospace Corp. Helicopters characteristically exhibit large amplitude vibration at low frequencies, often caused by the main rotor-induced shears and moments. To reduce these vibrations, the rotor is designed to minimize the induced shears and moments, and the fuselage is designed to be free of resonance at the frequencies of these rotor-induced inputs. Also, many helicopters employ vibration miti- gation devices. Under the sponsorship of Eustis Directorate, Kaman Aerospace has conducted experimental and analytical studies of the Dynamic Antiresonant Vibration Isolator (DAVI), an inertially coupled isolation device which permits a high degree of isolation at discrete low frequencies without sacrifice of elastic stiffness. The principles upon which the DAVI is based and laboratory test results are presented to show the inde- pendence of DAVI isolation from the weight of the isolated item. The application of the DAVI to crew seat isolation is also discussed. A summary of the work done on the application of the DAVI to helicopter rotor isolation, including results of analysis and testing, is presented. 1973 SA E Transactions 730893. Nodalization Applied to Helicopters. David Ship- man, Bell Helicopter Co., Div., Textron, Inc. A new passive vibration isolation method has been developed which offers less static deflection and lower transmissibility at the operating frequency than conven- tional passive isolators. The method consists of attaching the object to be isolated to nodal points which are developed when an elastic beam is excited by a vibrating source. Attachment at the nodes in a frequency band making isolation independent of the mass of the driven system. The immediate application is to eliminate helicopter fuselage vibration; however, because of its generality, it can be used wherever conventional isolators are used in isolating a limited range of vibration frequencies. 1973 SA E Transactions 730894. The Main Rotor Rifilar Absorber and Its Effect on Helicopter Reliability/Maintainability. Miller A. Wachs, Sikorsky Aircraft Div., United Air- craft Corp. The requirements of higher aircraft availability, lower maintenance costs, and a more comfortable passen- ger/crew environment demand low vibration in heli- copters. To meet this objective, Sikorsky Aircraft has developed and reduced to practice the main rotor head bifilar absorber. The bifilar absorber reduces vibration directly at the source - the main rotor. It cancels the rotor system exciting forces before they are transmitted into the airframe, and thus effectively controls vibration through- 196</page><page sequence="120">out the helicopter. Reduced vibration levels translate directly into improved reliability and maintainability. The principle of the bifilar absorber and the vibration reductions achieved in production installations are de- scribed. The quantitative improvement in reliability and reduction in maintenance resulting from the reduction in vibration are presented. The field data were collected from 15 aircraft without the bifilar absorber and from 15 aircraft with the bifilar absorber. The data show a 40% reduction in maintenance resulting from a 55% average vibration reduction. 1973 SA E Transactions 730895. Development of Parametricized Computations for AST Study Engines. R. Szeliga, General Electric Co. Aircraft Engine Group. A parametric computational concept has been developed that facilitates rapid and accurate generation of AST engine data suitable for mission analysis. This calculation tool, in the form of a computer program, considers the aerothermal, mechanical, installation, and noise aspects of different types of AST engines, while calculating installed performance, weight, and physical dimensions in a specified airflow size. 730896. Benefits of Advanced Propulsion Technology for the Advanced Supersonic Transport. Richard W. Hines and Joseph A. Sabatella, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, Div., United Aircraft Corp. Future supersonic transports will have to provide im- provement in the areas of economics, range, and emissions relative to the present generation of supersonic transports, as well as meeting or improving upon FAR36 noise goals. The significant simultaneous improvement in these areas represents a formidable technical and economic challenge in airplane and propulsion system design, and it is important to identify those propulsion system and ad- vanced technology areas which show a high potential payoff for the next generation supersonic transport. This paper will cover the promising propulsion systems including variable-cycle engine concepts for long-range supersonic commercial transport application. The benefits of applying advanced propulsion technology to solve the economic and environmental problems will be reviewed. The advanced propulsion technologies to be covered will be in the areas of structures, materials, cooling techniques, aerodynamics, variable engine ge- ometry, jet noise suppressors, acoustic treatment, and low-emission burners. The results of applying the advanced propulsion technology will be presented in terms of improvement in overall system takeoff gross weight and return on investment. 730897. Jet Noise Suppression Systems for High-Speed Aircraft. Craig D. Simcox, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. Jet noise is a major problem for high-speed aircraft. 730895-730899 Efficient methods of reduction must be found to have an economically viable and ecologically acceptable airplane. This paper discusses four noise reduction techniques and the constraints involved. Specific suppression systems are presented as an evaluation of current work. An analysis of the effect of suppressors on airplane performance is presented to demonstrate the requirement for step im- provements over suppression systems considered pre- viously. 730898. Propulsion Technology Advances Needed for a Quiet Supersonic Transport. Richard L. Foss and Ellwood L. Bragdon, Lockheed-California Co. Operation of a United States developed supersonic transport must and will meet community noise standards. This paper examines the airport noise problems of large transport aircraft, highlights critical considerations, and then studies possible solutions available from advanced propulsion technology. Engine sizing requirements to meet SST payload-range and airport performance criteria are reviewed first, and the impact of noise on the engine size and aircraft performance is then identified. Relief offered by noise suppressor development and technology advances that can be foreseen in the next decade for turbojet and turbofan engines are described. The advan- tages offered by a duct heating turbofan engine cycle are discussed. The potential offered by variable cycle engines to provide low noise characteristics with minimum penalty on performance are shown, and the practical restraints imposed on this potential by airframe aerodynamic noise is illustrated. The importance of supporting engine technology advances with corresponding improvements in aerodynamic technology so as to enhance both airplane performance and noise relief is discussed to show the benefits on noise footprint exposure and flight operation procedures. 730899. AST - A Fifth Engine for Environmental Con- sideration. Richard D. FitzSimmons and Walter C. Hoover, McDonnell Douglas Corp. No greater contribution seems to exist for improving supersonic transport economics than by improving the state-of-the-art of jet noise suppressors. Exact matching of thrust requirements for supersonic cruise, transonic acceleration, climb, and especially take-off-climb is complex. The present design becomes an equivalent five-engine configuration, where the extra thrust is required to enable environmental levels of FAR Part 36 to be achieved. The added size is required first to allow for engine throttling during takeoff run to provide reduced exhaust velocity and exhaust gas temperature consistent with suppressor structural limits, and second to make up for suppressor losses at takeoff flight speeds. As the engine selection must be closely tied to airplane selection, substantiation of the 2.2 Mach airplane selection is described. 197</page><page sequence="121">730900-730908 730900. Fasteners with a Memory. Carian W. Silha, U.S. Air Force Materials Lab.; and Walter Schwenk, Grumman Aerospace Corp. Nitinol, a nickel-titanium alloy, exhibits the unique property of undergoing a temperature-dependent phase transformation. Associated with this phase transformation is a significant shape change that has led to the common designation of "memory material." This shape change has been utilized to design mechanical fasteners which expand radially on transformation to produce interference fits for increased fatigue life components, give effective length reductions for high clamp-up forces, and form a rivet tail for low-cost installation. Various design concepts, man- ufacturing techniques, and mechanical properties are discussed. 1973 SA E Transactions 730901. Improved Fastener Systems for Fatigue and Sealing Redundancy of Low Shear Transfer Joints. J. H. Ruhl and R. L. Hurd, Huck Manufacturing Co. This paper summarizes the common knowledge available on the fatigue characteristics of low-shear transfer aircraft joints and explores some of the means for providing the desired performance with improved fastener systems. Factors to be considered for this type of joint to provide optimum joint redundance are: provide for optimum interference conditions in the shank area or produce optimum hole cold expansion; provide for flush recess material cold working and/or produce head interference as close to optimum as possible; clamp faying surfaces during hole preparation and shot peen this area; produce high quality holes that minimize irregularities, galling, laps, sharp edges, or excessive temperatures; provide protruding head and nut/collar local com- pression loading at hold edges, or coin around the hole with the fastener assembly; use the proper fastener preloads to provide adequate clamp force friction and to minimize fretting; and test chosen joint materials with the selected fastener geometries and characteristics to the aircraft flight spectrums under study. 730902. A Corrosion Inhibiting Coating for Structural Airframe Fasteners. Frank L. Gill, Hi-Shear Corp. Corrosion problems associated with using titanium fas- teners to assemble aluminum airframe structures are reviewed. Data are presented describing the effectiveness of metallic platings and an aluminum filled organic based coating on fasteners to render the titanium-aluminum electrochemical couple inoperative. The aluminum en- riched organic coating known as Hi-Kote 1 is shown to be more effective in minimizing corrosive attack on alu- minum airframe structure in both saline and acidic environments. The effectiveness of Hi-Kote 1 in corro- sion-fatigue tests of fastened aluminum structure is also reported. 1973 SA E Transactions 730903. Implementation of New Fasteners into Produc- tion. John E. Krezak, Boeing Commercial Air- craft Co. Performance and cost improvements force the devel- opment and implementation of new fasteners into pro- duction. Total internal company organization partici- pation is essential. Industry cooperation and use can be vital to economic success. Production feasibility tests to establish installation costs and production suitability must be established. These include: cost of inventory of existing on-going system; cost of surplus; tool cost for changeover; floor space required; inventory of parts in process; and cost of installation. Technical solutions should be flexible to minimize personal bias of partic- ipants. 730905. Fatigue Improvement by Sleeve Coldworking. Joseph L. Phillips, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. The sleeve coldworking process for fastener holes is a process that uses a tapered mandrel in conjunction with a disposable, prelubricated split sleeve to compressively prestress a significant zone around a fastener hole. This compressive prestressing offsets the stress concentration of the hole itself to produce substantial improvements in structural fatigue performance of fastened joints. The sleeve method allows higher degrees of prestressing than are possible with other methods and does not require precision controls and skills germane to other fatigue- rated hole preparation/fastener systems. 1973 SA E Transactions 730907. Advantages of Aircraft System Maturity. W. W. Way, McDonnell Douglas Corp. The maturing air transportation industry is finding profitability to be increasingly elusive. The cost of maintaining the aircraft of this industry has a substantial impact on profitability. It is incumbent on aircraft and system designers to minimize the cost of maintaining those aircraft to maximize profitability. Choosing mature components and systems, which have demonstrated reliability, are familiar to maintenance personnel, and for which spare inventory exists, is an effective technique for minimizing maintenance costs of a new aircraft. This paper discusses examples of such applications and describes the values that can result. 1973 SA E Transactions 730908. A Simplified Approach for Estimating Manufac- turing Cost at the Part Level. Dennis E. Blanch- field and Donald E. Lewis, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, Div., United Aircraft Corp.; and Michael G. Woodbury, Pacer Systems. A new approach to estimating manufacturing cost at the part level is described. This method is based on material specifications, weights, and other material parameters. The parts price estimating model is explained in terms of the data base, which includes such items as labor cost, 198</page><page sequence="122">material cost, manufacturing cost, material specification, part form, and weights. The model is then developed according to the type of input data available. 730909. An Approach Toward Optimizing Material Cost and Part Function in Advanced Powerplants. R. W. Stusrud, E. S. Nichols, B. A. Zolezzi and D. K. Hanink, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. This paper describes the recent and successful features of the intensive program at Detroit Diesel Allison, Division of GMC, to control the costs of advanced military aircraft gas turbine engines in line with the costs of current production engines and of those produced during the past several years. We have been attempting to incorporate highly advanced technology into our new products, while at the same time holding the costs in line with older technology products. In many instances, we have been able to use the advanced technology to lower costs at the same time that weight and performance are improved. There are examples of this in aerodynamics, mechanical design, and materials and processes. In other instances, the experience is more conventional, in that lower costs involve increases in weight; in these cases, lists of weight increases versus cost decreases are maintained, and the most attractive concepts are incorporated up to the acceptable weight limits of the engine specification. 730910. Low Cost Supersonic Expendable Turbine En- gines. Theodore E. Elsasser, Naval Air Propul- sion Test Center. The Navy is currently in the second phase of a program to develop a supersonic turbojet engine for tactical missile applications. The engines have been designed for a single mission only and for lowest possible cost. Three companies (AiResearch, Curtiss-Wright, and Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft) are under contract to fabricate and test the critical components of their respective engine designs. Each engine is described with emphasis on its low cost design features and fabrication techniques. The overall program status and available results of the current critical component phase are presented. Design requirements and problems unique to expendable turbine engine devel- opment are also discussed. 730911. Lycomings LTS 101 - Low Cost Turbine Power in the 600 hp Class. A. Myers and E. Pease, Lycoming Div., AVCO Corp. The LTS 101 has been designed to meet the requirements of low cost, high performance, and simplicity in a powerplant suitable for a variety of applications in the 600 shp class. This paper discusses the parametric cycle studies that led to integration of the LTS 101 aerodynamic components to achieve these goals, and presents results of full engine prototype tests. Design features that contribute to the low cost of ownership are described. 730909-730916 730913. STOL Tactical Aircraft Investigation. Joseph Hebert, Convair Aerospace Div., General Dy- namics Corp. Preliminary vehicle-equent design update based on related studies, wind tunnel tests, and flight simulations con- ducted during a STOL Tactical Aircraft Investigation are summarized. The designs developed during Part 1 of the study were based on state-of-the-art technology and powered by scaled derivative engines using existing cores. The three preliminary designs for the lift/ propulsion concepts were then updated during Part 2 to complete the study. Resulting point designs are based on data from 1100 hour wind tunnel tests, aerodynamic and stability- and-control methodology development, and stability and flight control technology studies. Technology developed by Convair Aerospace during the STOL Tactical Aircraft Investigation shows that a light and efficient advanced medium STOL transport can be designed and produced. 730914. Air Force STOL Tactical Aircraft Investigation: Evaluation of Externally Blown Flaps. Marshall H. Roe, Los Angeles Aircraft Div., Rockwell International. A study of external blown flaps for application to a medium-sized STOL transport has been completed as part of the U.S. Air Force STOL Tactical Aircraft Investi- gation program. Partial results of wind tunnel tests, design trade studies, and flight simulation tests are presented to illustrate the status of externally blown flap technology relative to Air Force STOL transport requirements. It was concluded that the basic technology is adequately devel- oped for attainment of the performance goals. Continuing engineering work is indicated in the areas of flight control • system synthesis and component reliability. 1973 SA E Transactions 730915. External Blowing Flap Technology on the USAF /McDonnell Douglas YC-15 (AMST) Pro- gram. Ervin R. Heald, McDonnell Douglas Corp. The YC-15 will be the first aircraft to employ the externally blown flap powered lift system. Since the success of the aircraft to a large extent is dependent upon the proper functioning of this system, considerable effort is going into its design. This paper discusses some of the fundamental aerodynamic considerations which led to the selection of the specific flap configuration and presents resulting aerodynamic characteristics. Structural design criteria for the system and methods of analysis are covered, as are details of the flap actuating system and structure. 1973 SAE Transactions 730916. Upper Surface Blowing Technology as Applied to the YC-14 Airplane. John K. Wimpress, The Boeing Co. 199</page><page sequence="123">730917-730921 The exhaust from a high bypass ratio turbofan engine, passing over the upper surface of a wing and trailing edge flap system, can be deflected by the Coanda effect to create both deflected thrust and super circulation. This technique, known as upper surface blowing, has been applied to the Air Force/Boeing YC-14 advanced medium STOL transport airplane. Laboratory and wind tunnel tests have shown very efficient turning of the jet flow, large values of super circulation, and excellent boundary layer control of the external flow on the upper surface of the wing. This combination creates a powered lift system having unusual efficiency and versatility. 1973 SA E Transactions 730917. The T700-GE-700 Turboshaft Engine Program. William J. Crawford III, General Electric Co. The 1500 shp T700 engine is being developed for the U.S. Army UTTAS and AAH helicopters. Prototype engines have been running well since testing began early in 1973. Qualification is expected in early 1976. Engine history and current details, design features, program milestones, and possible future developments are reviewed. The unique T700 design will achieve unusually high levels of reliability and maintainability. 730918. The Garrett- AiResearch Variable-Cycle TFE731 Turbofan Engine. W. R. Davenport and G. J. Dixon, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. of Ari- zona, Div., Garrett Corp. In order to demonstrate the potential benefits of variable- turbine geometry in a turbofan engine, the U.S. Air Force Aero Propulsion Laboratory funded Garrett-AiResearch to build and test a variable-cycle turbofan engine. The engine selected for the demonstration is the Garrett- AiResearch Model TFE731-2 two-spool, geared-turbofan engine modified to accept variable geometry in the LP turbine, LP compressor, and exhaust nozzles. Throughout approximately 72h of engine testing at sea level, static conditions, the variable-cycle engine has demonstrated that these variable-geometry components provide an effective means of rematching the engine components to obtain improved performance character- istics. For example, the concept of maintaining constant inlet total airflow and low-pressure-compressor surge margin while modulating engine thrust was demonstrated during this testing. This concept, in turn, relates directly to the potential of improving installed engine performance over that of a fixed engine by reducing inlet spillage and aft-end external drag. The variable-cycle TFE731 engine program is con- tinuing and will include simulated, high-altitude, high- Mach-number testing. In addition, analytical studies will further explore the benefits of the current variable geometry, as well as those afforded by additional variable components as related to overall system performance. 730919. Further Development of the JT15D Turbofan. R. H. Anschutz, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, Div., United Aircraft Corp.; and D. L. Cook, United Aircraft Of Canada, Ltd. When United Aircraft's JT15D engine was first consid- ered for potential high-altitude, low flight speed, long- endurance applications by the U.S. Air Force the questions were: 1. Will the engine run at these altitudes? 2. Can it deliver the required thrust? 3. Can it deliver the required power extraction? 4. What is the specific fuel consumption? 5. What oil system modifications are needed? 6. What is the optimum control system? 7. Are there other unknowns? A JT15D-4 turbofan engine, with only minor modi- fications which were easily incorporated into engines coming off the production line, proved more than adequate to achieve predicted endurance goals and measured performance. 730920. Heavy Lift Helicopter Main Engines. David R. Woodley, Boeing Vertol Co.; and William S. Castle, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The heavy lift helicopter (HLH) is the airborne com- ponent of a container ship and helicopter logistics system. The U.S. Army initiated a program for development of advanced-technology components for the HLH in June 1971 to reduce the risk associated with future procurement of an air vehicle. The components now under devel- opment by Boeing Vertol include the rotor and drive systems, flight-control system, and cargo-handling system. In addition, Boeing Vertol selected and procured rep- resentative HLH engines for use on an integrated rotor- and drive-system test rig. The HLH program has now been extended to include construction and flight-test demonstration of an austere prototype aircraft to evaluate the advanced-technology components in a dynamic environment. This paper describes powerplant aspects of the HLH program including engine sizing, selection, and devel- opment of the Detroit Diesel Allison 501-M62B engine for the test rig, and discusses the current development program for XT701-AD-700 flight engines for use in the HLH prototype. 730921. Standardization Activity for Metric Aerospace Fasteners. Thomas C. Baumgartner, Standard Pressed Steel Co. As more countries become involved in joint manufac- turing programs, the need for standardization increases. One facet of this is the development of the International System of Units, which is gaining widespread interna- tional acceptance. In the aerospace industry the need for standardization is well-recognized. In Europe, the Association of Aero- nautical and Space Equipment Manufacturers has been established. This institution, which is restricted to Euro- pean nations, publishes standards with SI as the basic 200</page><page sequence="124">module. On a worldwide basis, the most important standardizing body is the International Organization for Standardization, established by a United Nations com- mittee in 1944. Its 60 member nations work together in committees to prepare draft standards for membership approval. And in the United States, all activity is directed through the American National Standards Institute, the official representative in the ISO. ANSI in turn delegates to various organizations the responsibility for developing positions representing this country. 730922. Plan Now for the Problems of Metric Transition. Robert B. Toth, Aerospace Div., Martin Mari- etta Corp. This paper does not argue the pros and cons of metrication but assumes that legislation to effect conver- sion will be passed in the near future. The critical problems that must be faced during the transition from the conventional inch/pound system to SI are highlighted. Problems encountered by the British aerospace industry during their transition from imperial measure to SI are assessed. The problems that face United States industry are defined, and ways for alleviating them are suggested in a series of recommendations that constitute a plan for transition to metric at the company level.

This paper presents the metric program approach taken by the Boeing Aerospace Co. in the design and fabrication of the PHM hydrofoil ship. The program approach was to maintain a strict metric base line allowing exceptions only where extensive qualifications, schedule impact, costs, and reductions of performance were imposed by a metric design. The program metric implementation plan is described. A discussion is provided of the metric problems encountered and the solutions evolved. The PHM ship evolves as a hybrid design where the structural design is metric and some of its operating systems are inch designs. An analogy is made relating the approach to more sophisticated aerospace- type programs as spacecraft, aircraft, etc. The analysis is made on the basis of a need for additional aerospace quality engineering metric stan- dards in order to produce a complete metric design. The paper advocates an early start in creating key engineering metric standards and the need for industry/ government cooperation to reduce cost. 1973 SAE Transactions 730924. Metrication and Planning to Meet Its Demands in Aerospace Engineering and Manufacturing. Donald E. E. Carmody, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. Aerospace will, in all probability, be among the very first 730922-730926 industries to be affected when the United States gov- ernment, after 180 years of debate, finally decides to "go metric." In view of this well-founded premise, and the prevalent belief that the Congress will afford positive support to a program to adopt the SI, this paper provides, along with a brief introduction to the history of metri- cation and SI units, an outline of how the demands of metrication must be met if the conversion to SI units is to be successful. It notes why the introduction of SI units will necessitate the development of individual company plans for metrication and what the common features will be. The basic common features discussed are: a genuine understanding of metrication, need for an evaluation which will establish the degree to which an organization will be affected, requirement for a schedule for intro- duction of the metrication program, educational provi- sions, coordinated implementation, and publicity. 1973 SAE Transactions 730925. Auxiliary Propulsion Subsystems for the Space Shuttle Orbiter. Donald L. Jones, Rockwell International Corp. The Space Shuttle Orbiter vehicle employs two earth storable bipropellant propulsion subsystems to provide orbit maneuvering and vehicle attitude control. Respec- tively, these are the orbit maneuvering subsystem (OMS) and the reaction control subsystem (RCS). The OMS provides the velocity increments necessary to achieve final insertion of the vehicle into earth orbit, to perform orbital changes, and to deorbit the vehicle. It is made up of two normally independent propulsion subsys- tems in removable pads. The RCS provides the orbiter with the necessary stabilization, maneuvering, and translation capability while in earth orbit and during reentry. The current RCS concept has evolved as the result of detailed tradeoffs between several competing options. The most recent trade study has resulted in a change from monopropellant to bipropellant to provide lower operational program costs. 730926. Space Shuttle Main Engine Turbopump Design. R. B. Fürst, Rocketdyne Div., Rockwell Inter- national. This paper presents the unique constraints imposed upon the turbopumps for the space shuttle main engine. Operating requirements are listed and the mechanical and fluid dynamic design features evolved to satisfy the performance requirements within the constraints imposed by the engine system are discussed. The constraints include the high-chamber pressure and staged-combustion cycle, along with weight restrictions and low propellant tank pressures. The turbopumps must raise the orbiter fuel tank and oxidizer tank propellant pressures to the level required by the engine. The turbopumps designed feature integral impeller balance pistons, a double-entry oxidizer pump, and low-pressure pumps driven by compatible turbine fluids. These are described in detail. 201</page><page sequence="125">730927-730932 730927. Space Shuttle Main Engine Control System. P. F. Seitz and R. F. Searle, Rocketdyne Div./ Rockwell International. The Space Shuttle Main Engine is a reusable, high- performance rocket engine being developed by the Rocketdyne Div. of Rockwell International to satisfy the operational requirements of the Space Shuttle Orbiter Vehicle. The design incorporates a hydraulically actu- ated, closed-loop servosystem controlled and monitored by a programmable electronic digital controller. The controller accepts vehicle commands for the various engine operational phases, positions the appropriate valves, monitors the engine for the required performance precisions and conditions, and provides redundancy management. 730928. Shuttle Ferry Propulsion System. James F. Doell, Rockwell International Corp. A unique propulsion system is being developed for the Space Shuttle Orbiter utilizing airbreathing engines to provide a means for horizontal flight testing and ferrying the Orbiter within the contiguous United States. Prima- rily, NASA was concerned with ferrying the Orbiter from manufacturing site to launch site, but emergency situa- tions were also considered which would require subse- quent takeoff and ferry. To fulfill these objectives, certain ground rules and criteria were selected. The current ferry configuration, which meets these requirements and the limitations imposed by the Orbiter itself, consists of six TF33-P-7 non-afterburning engines mounted two in a pod under each wing with a third twin engine pod under the fuselage between the main landing gears. The airbreathing engine arrangement which has resulted still possesses installation problems because of the low ground clearance. However, it represents the best compromise with the many limitations which exist, and is a feasible configuration for the limited number of ferry flights anticipated over the life of the Orbiter. 730929. Production Acceptance Testing Using an Im- proved Acoustic Signature Analysis. R. P. Chen, F. T. Yokota, D. V. Allen and J. A. Friedericy, AiResearch Manufacturing Div., The Garrett Corp. This paper presents the composite exceedance method as an alternative to the more costly broadband power spectral density (PSD) analysis which is the standard method of acoustic signature analysis for rotating ma- chinery. The composite exceedance is superior to the PSD analysis in that the computational procedure is straight- forward and effective without the use of Fourier Trans- forms and, therefore, lends itself to simple programming, and the information extracted from the vibration data is represented in one master plot, permitting direct evalu- ation of all g peak levels encountered in terms of the number of occurrences above which they exceed a given level of acceleration. The sensitivity of anomaly detection by the proposed method has been demonstrated in a number of actual cases, one of which is discussed. The data collection methodology and philosophy of the method as they relate to narrow-band Gaussian random processes are also considered. 730930. New Machinery Health Diagnostic Techniques Using High-Frequency Vibration. R. F. Burchill, J. L. Frarey and D. S. Wilson, Shaker Research Corp. A technique is discussed for generating diagnostic infor- mation from the vibration signature of machinery in the high-frequency range (up to 100 kHz). The signal generation mechanism is discussed, as well as the diagnostically significant characteristics of the data and a method of extracting this information. Two specific cases are presented utilizing the techniques to illustrate its suitability for many of the common problems encountered in machinery. 730931. Acoustic Signature Analysis of Space Program Mechanical Devices. Dwain Kitchel, Apollo and Ground Systems, General Electric Co.; and Kempton A. Smith, Corporate Research &amp; Development Center, General Electric Co. Predominant features of sound signatures can be related back to operational events occurring within components both for normal and failure mode operations. Engineering analysis permits establishment of quantized go, no-go, or caution parameters necessary to make readiness assess- ment decisions. The "Structure Borne Acoustics" test technique presented in this paper has outstanding potential for this work. Reliability includes accurate detection and diag- nosis of the maximum number of faults, with an absolute minimum false alarm rate. Jet engine-bearing monitoring is one example of successful application. 730932. Vibration Monitoring of a 750 kw Gas Turbine Generator. George D. Xistris, Naval Engineering Test Establishment (Canada). Machinery maintenance programs based on vibration trend monitoring have been successfully used in several applications. In essence, these programs rely on the interpretation of changing machinery vibration patterns to diagnose developing defects and subsequently define a relative condition index. This information, along with other operating parameters and constraints, is then used to draw up meaningful maintenance schedules. This paper, after a brief review of the vibration monitoring programs in use by the Sea Element of the Canadian Armed Forces, discusses the operational prob- lems that arise in the definition of a vibration health monitoring program for a 750 kW gas turbine generator. It describes in detail the rationale for selecting the location of points where measurements should be made and lists the mechanical components which influence the vibration pattern at each station. The effect of local resonances and limitations of 202</page><page sequence="126">instrumentation used are identified for a portable octave band measurement system utilizing a magnet attached accelerometer. Finally, the inaccessibility of monitoring stations within the acoustic enclosure to periodic meas- urements is examined and two possible solutions are proposed. 730933. Use of Simulators in the Design and Development of Flight Control Systems. J. T. Gallagher and W. Nelson, Northrop Corp. Recent advances in the design and developent of motion simulators, visual display systems, artificial force pro- ducers, and computer capability have enhanced the effectiveness of ground-based simulators in the design process. At Northrop, a systematic improvement in simulator subsystems has resulted in the existence of the Northrop Large Amplitude Three-Axis Flight Simulator which has 6 degrees of freedom. The simulator is a significant tool in the design of flight control systems, particularly in today's environment where the aerospace industry is attempting to extend the performance envel- opes of its products through the use of nonconventional configurations and radical flight control system concepts. Some examples are presented in this paper to demonstrate the contribution that the Northrop Large Amplitude Three- Axis Flight Simulator is making in the YF-17 program to the solution of current flight control system problems that are not soluble by analytical techniques. 730934. Computer-Aided Design and Drafting (CADD): An Advanced Designer's Tool. Richard D. Ward and Eugene G. Koeller, McDonnell Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. Computer graphics has become the bridge between the computer and the designer. McDonnell Douglas' CADD system was originally developed for parts layout and solutions to geometry problems, and this restriction was maintained until recently so development could be controlled. Now, with the maturing of the system, several disciplines are converting the computer graphics design package to their special applications. Recent advances in computer graphics software have been adapted to advanced design. The integration of these disciplines has required a number of changes in design techniques in order to evolve and evaluate a conceptual configuration. However, the time savings alone will allow advanced design teams to define and analyze more configurations earlier in the design cycle, resulting in much greater design visibility and with greater accuracy. 1973 SA E Transactions 730935. Advanced Flutter Design Techniques. J. B. Bart- ley and M. J. Turner, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. The general characteristics of flutter problems affecting the structural design of both subsonic and supersonic 730933-730938 transport aircraft are discussed in relation to configu- ration constraints resulting from mission performance and environmental impact requirements. Combined analytical and experimental approaches employed in the assessment and solution of these problems are outlined. Included are discussions of the extensive application of automated procedures in the use of high-speed digital computers for flutter analysis and the dependence on highly sophisti- cated wind tunnel flutter model construction techniques to provide reliable experimental data. Illustrations of the application of design techniques to supersonic and subsonic aircraft are presented. 1973 SA E Transactions 730936. An Integrated Approach to Structural Weight Estimation. L. Ascani and G. Hayase, Rockwell International. The need for evaluating and optimizing airframes of advanced aircraft configurations with exceptional speed and accuracy has resulted in the development of highly sophisticated computerized techniques. Sensitivity of these programs to advanced materials, construction types, aeroelasticity, structural dynamics, configuration geome- try, airloads, missions, and performance has all but obsoleted the statistical approach to the problem solution. The competitive nature of the field has also placed unusually severe demands on calendar time available for such evaluations. This has resulted in the development of integrated analytical computer programs that have the required sensitivity and rapid turnaround time to face the competitive nature of today's environment. At Rockwell International's Los Angeles Aircraft Division a Structural Weight Estimation Program has been developed, both with IR &amp; D funds, and as stand alone programs, and as a completely self-contained, integrated program which integrates all necessary disci- plinary functions through data management modules that control the logic of the more than 200 subroutines. All primary structural components are synthesized through idealized approximations of the physical characteristics of the required structure. Secondary structure is estimated using both statistical and analytical procedures. The output of the program is a weight statement of the complete air vehicle, vehicle mass properties, and a description of primary structural members. Use of this program has resulted in significantly improved management and technical visibility into the sensitivity of airframes to important structural and configuration parameters leading to higher performance and lower cost products. 730938. Simulation of Captive Flight Aircraft Store Vibrations. Alan H. Burkhard, Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory. Traditional assembled store vibration testing techniques do not realistically simulate a store's captive flight environment. Extensive flight and laboratory testing has shown that an integrated acoustic and vibration shaker 203</page><page sequence="127">730939-730944 technique can realistically reproduce a store's captive flight vibration environment. This paper describes acoustic tests on six flight instrumented stores, giving details of physical setup, test procedure, and test results. Test procedures and analysis of test data are presented for those stores used to evaluate vibration shaker testing techniques. 730939. Simulation of the Sparrow Flight Vibration Environment. Jon C. Calkins, U. S. Naval Missile Center; and Allan G. Piersol, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. Laboratory and captive flight experiments were per- formed using an instrumented Sparrow III missile to evaluate the relative merits of direct mechanical vibration and reverberant acoustic noise tests as techniques for simulating the Sparrow captive flight vibration envi- ronment. For the laboratory experiments, the mechanical vibration and acoustic noise excitations were applied in accordance with a common response-controlled test specification. The resulting missile vibration data were then standardized and compared with the vibration levels measured during captive flight to determine their simi- larity in terms of directional, spatial, and spectral distributions. The results indicate that the acoustic noise test simulated the captive flight vibration more accurately than did the mechanical vibration test. However, the accuracy of the simulation provided by the mechanical vibration excitation was not acceptable for practical applications. 1973 SA E Transactions 730940. Acoustic Simulation of Spacecraft Flight Vibra- tion Environment. W. Henricks, Lockheed Mis- siles and Space Co., Inc. A reverberant acoustic field is frequently used in ground testing when it is desired to generate a spacecraft vibration environment similar to that encountered in flight. The sound-pressure level specified to accomplish this is usually the same as the maximum expected flight fluctuating pressure level. Experience has shown this to be an inadequate way to specify reverberant ground test levels because of basic differences in the characteristics of the reverberant and flight fluctuating pressure fields. This paper reviews pertinent information on this subject that has recently been obtained from large upper-stage space vehicles. 1973 SAE Transactions 730941. Flight Experience With Apollo Spacecraft Pro- pulsion Systems. Joseph G. Thibodaux, Jr., Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, NASA. Apollo 17 ended the most successful application of rocket propulsion systems in man's history. A total of 23 developmental and manned operational flights were made. Seven hundred and sixty-three spacecraft rocket engines were flown in the program. Over 6h of manned rocket flights were logged by the spacecraft propulsion systems and approximately one million rocket engine firings were made. One engine failure was encountered on an early unmanned flight as a result of a failure in the guidance programmer which caused the engine to operate in a manner known to cause failures. Numerous opera- tional problems and malfunctions were observed, how- ever, system and component redundancy prevented loss of mission objectives and never jeopardized crew safety. Performance of all systems was usually nominal and most problems were merely nuisances. This paper will present some highlights of Apollo propulsion performance and will provide a bibliography of all flight results. 730942. The Evaluation of Thrust Vector Control Systems for Advanced, Controllable, Solid-Propelled In- terceptor Motors. D. C. Sayles, U.S. Army Advanced Ballistic Missile Defense Agency. A special subscale, pintle-mounted gas generator was developed by the Army Advanced Ballistic Missile Defense Agency. It was used to comparatively evaluate the thrust vector control systems which might be used in conjunction with pintle-controlled interceptor motors. The two thrust vector control systems which have been evaluated to date are: the gimballed, supersonic splitline thrust vector control system and the techroll movable nozzle thrust vector control system. These evaluations were carried out under simulated altitude conditions with the gas generator operating in a boost and a sustain mode as part of the duty cycle. This paper will discuss the design of this thrust vector control gas generator, motor fabrication, its multiple ignition system, the thrust vector control systems, test objectives, test procedures, and test results. 730943. Techroll Seal Movable Nozzle Development. R. J. Hall, United Aircraft Corp. The Techroll joint is a constant-volume, fluid-filled bearing configured with a pair of rolling convolutes that permits omniaxis deflection of a solid rocket motor nozzle. The fluid-filled bearing is pressurized by nozzle ejection loads and serves as both the movable nozzle bearing and nozzle seal. The Techroll seal is made of a fabric- reinforced elastomeric composite material and does not require complex manufacturing processes or tight tol- erances. The Techroll joint has undergone development under U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Army funding and has been demonstrated on six separate contracts involving 12 different designs. This paper introduces the concept, presents four of the designs, and summarizes the per- formance characteristics of seven designs. 730944. Linear Rocket Engine Design-Fabrication-Test- ing. P. N. Fuller, Rocketdyne Div./Rockwell International. A new rocket engine concept that is presently being evaluated offers significant performance, cost, and con- figurational advantages. The Linear Rocket Engine 204</page><page sequence="128">System (LRES) combines the unique performance and operational advantages of the aerospike nozzle with the configuration versatility of low cost modular combustors, which results in a high-performance rocket engine pack- age designed specifically for use in advanced configu- ration vehicles. This paper describes the design, fabri- cation, and testing of the LRES concept to evaluate its potential for vehicle integration. The program was conducted under the sponsorship of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. 730945. Evaluation of Advanced Air Vehicle Designs in the USAF. Wayne M. O'Connor, Aeronautical Systems Division, Air Force Systems Command. Design studies performed by the U.S. Air Force examine the implications of various capabilities. These internal studies highlight questionable areas, define critical ele- ments, provide sensitivity information, and form the basis for understanding subsequent work. The Interactive Computer Aided Design (ICAD) system has been de- signed to combine the best capabilities of the computer and man. It develops data needed to permit a rational choice between alternate sets of requirements, and develops the internal expertise necessary to evaluate the design proposed to meet these requirements. 730947. Evaluation of V/STOL Research Aircraft De- signs. Wallace H. Deckert and Curt A. Holz- häuser, Ames Research Center, NASA. The evaluation and evolution of direct jet lift V/STOL transport aircraft designs are discussed. The V/STOL transport design selected as an example is a lift-fan design that was evaluated as a candidate configuration for a possible future V/STOL research transport. The paper includes discussion of potential advanced V/STOL land- ing approach profiles as key design requirements for V/STOL aircraft, description, and experimental results of an integrated propulsion/control system designed to achieve desired advanced V/STOL near- terminal oper- ating capabilities, and results from evaluating V/STOL designs on piloted moving-base simulators. This paper discusses use of the piloted moving-base simulator as a design tool for evolving satisfactory V/STOL stabilization and propulsion/control systems. Included are problems and solutions identified during simulation of simultaneous decelerating/descent steep curved landing approaches under instrument flight con- ditions. Simulation results are also compared to flight results obtained with the DO-31 V/STOL research transport. 730948. Development of Requirements for, and Evalua- tion of, Manufacturer Advanced Design Aircraft. Jack D. Graef, American Airlines, Inc. The art of defining a new airplane to suit the requirements of a particular airline involves a mixture of science, technical judgment, and business acumen. The same considerations are involved in evaluating new manufac- 730945-730955 turer designs, although somewhat more refined analytical tools are available to decrease the dependence on the human element. This paper highlights some of the important problems that an airline faces in determining its new aircraft needs, and using historical data, it illustrates some of the analytic methods used. Interpretations of the analyses are made to focus on the most basic requirement of any new airplane, the transportation of revenue payload at a profit. Constraints which the operator's system imposes on the design of new aircraft, along with a brief discussion of their potential effect on cost (or profitability), are included. The paper discusses the risks and potential payoffs which are inherent in any new airplane program. It also discusses some of the key elements involved in the evaluation and selection process of new manufacturer airplane designs. Analytic tools used for evaluation of critical characteristics are described, and illustrations of the use of some of these tools are shown. 1973 SA E Transactions 730953. Introduction to Advanced Systems Monitor. John Donohue, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. There is a trend in future commercial aircraft toward more integration of systems, functions, and displays. Many benefits can be realized through proper integration, the most significant being improved operating efficiency. The Advanced Systems Monitor (ASM) is a display integration device using digital data acquisition and processing techniques together with a cathode ray tube or other advanced integrated displays. The ASM provides operating data to the flight crew and maintenance data to the ground crew. While these two functions appear different, the difference is quite often in form rather than substance. The system parametric data used for per- formance indication to the flight crew often have the intelligence to identify malfunctioning units to the ground crew. This intelligence can be extracted through use of the computer. Incorporation of a computer in the ASM design provides processed data to the crews, as well as raw data. This processed data can take the form of specific instructions for corrective action when system malfunc- tions occur. 1973 SA E Transactions 730955. Advance Airborne System for Maintenance Mon- itoring. B. M. Meador and J. F. Nemecek, Trans World Airlines, Inc. In-flight performance monitoring of aircraft has become a valuable time- and cost-saving tool for the airlines over the last few years. This paper describes the development of such techniques on TWA's DC-9, 747, and L-1011 aircraft. The aircraft integrated data system (AIDS) has been the basis of TWA's maintenance monitoring. Initially installed in 1966 on the DC-9, the system was later expanded to the jumbo jets. This paper describes the parameters monitored, the computer interlocks, and 205</page><page sequence="129">730956-730963 maintenance scheduling which results. Specific examples solved via these techniques are given. 1973 SAE Transactions 730956. Electronic Display Mechanization for Monitoring Aircraft Parameters. Richard A. Wallace and Parm L. Narveson, Flight Systems Div., Sperry Rand Corp. A concept for using cathode ray tube and digital techniques to display aircraft system parameters in the cockpit of a jet transport is presented in this paper. These parameters relate to engine thrust management and displays that are conventionally associated with the flight engineer's station. The sensor and signal processing requirements are integrated with those for recording of flight data in accordance with federal aviation regulations and also for maintenance considerations. 1973 SAE Transactions 730957. Data Acquisition, Processing, and Control for Advanced Aircraft. H. E. Sutherland, Teledyne Controls. The Advanced System Monitor (ASM) is an integrated display device using digital data acquisition and process- ing techniques, and is intended for a new generation of transport aircraft. It provides the flight crew with the critical airplane condition data in one centralized location. The equipment described constitutes the data acqui- sition, processing, and control portion which works in conjunction with the ASMs electronic display. The mechanization is a dual redundant system having oper- ational modes which allow for the safe flight of aircraft even if there are two failures. The heart of the system is a general-purpose computer which monitors and, on command, provides the crew with aircraft condition status and automatically notifies of deteriorating conditions so that an appropriate action can be taken. This sytems also accommodates the recording of maintenance and crew performance parameters. 730958. (SP-385) Potentials for Advanced Civil Transport Aircraft. Edward C. Wells, The Boeing Co. In this lecture, a review of Boeing commercial transport models is presented in chronological order from the B-l flying boat of 1919 to the 747. The problems of air transport systems including convenience, reliability, safe- ty, comfort, performance, and financial and environ- mental costs are discussed. The probability of more severe future problems is considered, and suggestions are offered as to technology and system improvements which may need to be pursued if civil air transport systems are to continue to provide fast, convenient transportation with a high level of public acceptance. 1973 SAE Transactions 730959. Effect of Exhaust Deflectors on the Design of Lift Plus Lift/Cruise V/STOL Aircraft. David Mig- dal, Grumman Aerospace Corp. This paper discusses design and experimental studies demonstrating the effect of vectored nozzle type, shape, location, and orientation on V/STOL aircraft design. The differences in single and twin-engine aircraft are outlined, along with complete aircraft sizing and mission results for twin-engine aircraft. It is concluded that detailed V/ STOL data as well as high-speed weight/performance data are needed to select the optimum nozzle, that significant variations in lift/cruise exhaust deflectors are possible and therefore that careful attention to thrust and mass balancing criteria must be included in mission studies, that the exhaust deflector can significantly alter fountain properties during V/STOL operation which can be used to advantage, and that the exhaust deflector may also provide favorable high-speed interactions in addition to its use as an inflight thrust deflector. 730960. The Influence of Engine Technology Advance- ments on Aircraft Economics. J. W. Witherspoon and W. O. Gaffin, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. A technology advancement in a new powerplant has both favorable and unfavorable effects, that is, increased bypass ratio and compression ratio, coupled with high turbine temperature, improve performance but also increase engine price and maintenance cost. Such tech- nology advancements must be carefully evaluated in terms of environmental, performance, and cost effects to be sure that the benefits outweight the possible penalties. The factors that should be evaluated in choosing an engine for airline use are discussed. These factors are evaluated and compared for two engines that might be considered for future 150-200 passenger airplanes: an all-new turbofan and a quiet derivative of an existing first generation turbofan. The results of the performance and cost evaluations of the example engines are reduced to common units so they can be combined, using a technique suggested by American Airlines, Inc. 730963. (P-51) Passenger Injuries in Collisions and Their Relation to General Speed Scale. K. Langwieder, German Association of Motor Traffic Insurers. Injuries sustained by car occupants were studied on the basis of representative material comprising 29,000 acci- dents. As a unit of reference in defining typical accident categories, the relative collision speed (RCS) was defined, rendering it possible to take into account of real-life factors. The importance of the RCS as a categorizing method is discussed in relation to the equivalent test speed (ETS) in crash tests. The frequency of actual accidents with regard to five typical accident categories and the resulting passenger injuries are indicated. The influence exercised by the mass of the vehicle, its deformation characteristics, its turning away movement in collision, and its interior safety are compared in accidents involving four typical vehicle categories. The confron- tation with an equivalent number of accidents whereby 206</page><page sequence="130">the passengers were belted clearly showed the benefit of safety belt usage. The collision speeds of 94 frontal accidents with fatal injuries to occupants are discussed. The paper specifies up to what speed safety tests for typical accident categories are to be carried out in order to include 90% of all accidents. 730964. (P-51) Seat Belts - Limits of Protection: A Study of Fatal Injuries Among Belt Wearers. J. Michael Henderson and James M. Wyllie, Dept. of Motor Transport (Australia). Because the use of seat belts when available is mandatory in Australia and now at a high level, a high proportion of those who crash are wearing seat belts. The further protection of these occupants is high priority. This paper reports a study of a series of fatally injured occupants of recent-model passenger cars, performed in order to investigate the potential for extension of the limits of seat belt performance in crashes that are currently fatal. Improvements in seat belt design and installation should reduce a proportion of current losses from death and injury, but further reductions in these losses will demand attention not only to the crashworthiness of the car but also to the characteristics of the other vehicles and roadside structures that are commonly impacted. 730965. (P-51) A Study of Seat Belts and Injuries. G. Anthony Ryan, Monash University Medical School (Australia). This paper studies the effects of wearing seat belts ip severe crash impacts in Victoria, Australia. In the study it was found that there were some injuries associated with wearing seat belts, but most of these were minor. There was an association between incorrect adjustment of seat belts and the occurrence of injury. There is a need for seat belt systems to be foolproof so that they can only be worn correctly. 730966. (P-51) Fracture Mechanism of Lower Legs Under Impact Load. Martin Kramer, Klaus Burow and Alfred Heger, Berlin Technical Univ. The increasing number of injured or even killed pedes- trians in urban traffic accidents demands the attention of automobile designers to improve the outside safety operation of the vehicles. To incorporate an effective pedestrian-protection system - such as bumper, engine hood, etc. - in the vehicle, one needs the relevant infor- mation about the injury limits of the pedestrians. It is also well known that most pedestrians, partic- ularly at lower speeds, are injured in the region of the lower legs; therefore, it is necessary to know the injury limits between vehicle and pedestrian, and hence this investigation has been initiated. This paper reports on the mechanism of injuries of the tibia under dynamic load conditions. Some 209 tests with cadavers of recently deceased people representing the 730964-730968 normal pedestrian population were carried out on a twin-pendulum catapult. Impact load has been brought up by bumper-shaped impact bodies; the point of impact was varied between the patella and the distal end of the tibia. During the tests, the time histories of the leg decelerations were recorded, and a pathological dissection just after the tests gave us the details of the incurred injuries. These data are further evaluated using a digital computer. The relation between the mechanical and biological properties of the test specimens were thus determined, and the influence of constitution, age, and sex as well as loading form, center of impact, and energy during the impact was analyzed. The breaking forces are shown as a function of impact velocity as well as the particulars of the injuries, depending upon physiological parameters thus describing critical limits, from which the risk of being severely injured will sharply rise. The relations between mechan- ical and physiological parameters allow estimation of the severity of real-world injuries through the dummy tests. 730967. (P-51) Response of Human Larynx to Blunt Loading. J. W. Melvin and R. G. Snyder, Highway Safety Res. Inst., The Univ. of Mich- igan; L. W. Travis and N. R. Olson, Medical School, The Univ. of Michigan. Direct impact to the larnyx is usually prevented in accidents by thsjprotective nature of the chin. In some situations, the occupant motions leave the larnyx unpro- tected and susceptible to impact by the steering wheel rim or instrument panel. As one of the unpaired vital organs of the body, there is no easy way to provide an alternative for its functions when the larnyx is lost or damaged. Information available on the tolerance of the unembalm- ed human larnyx to force is quite limited. This paper describes a multidisciplinary study to determine the response of unembalmed human laryngés to blunt mechanical loading and to interpret the response with respect to clinical data. Fresh intact laryngés were obtained at autopsy and tested at either static or dynamic loading conditions utilizing special test fixtures in mate- rials-testing machines. Load and deformation data were obtained up to levels sufficient to produce significant fractures in both the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. Additional information was obtained in the form of permanent dimensional changes through direct meas- urements and location of fracture sites by use of xeroradiography. Final evaluation of the damage was performed following dissection of the laryngeal structure. The results of the tests are analyzed and interpreted in relation to establishing tolerance criteria for laryngeal loading. 730968. (P-51) Impact Injury Mechanisms in Abdominal Organs. J. W. Melvin, R. L. Stalnaker and V. L. Roberts, Highway Safety Res. Inst., The Univ. of Michigan; and M. L. Trollope, The Univ. of Michigan. 207</page><page sequence="131">730969-730971 Blunt abdominal trauma is a major cause of death in the United States. However, little experimental work has been done to clarify the mechanism of blunt abdominal injury and to quantify tolerance parameters for the abdominal organs. This paper describes a joint study by the Highway Safety Research Institute and the Section of General Surgery of The University of Michigan in which direct impacts were applied to livers and kidneys. The tests were performed in a high-speed testing machine at a controlled ram velocity and stroke limit. The organ was surgically mobilized in anesthesized Rhesus monkeys and then placed on a load cell while still being perfused in the living animal. Tests were performed at ram speeds of 120, 6000, and 12000 in/min (5, 250, and 500 cm/s). The resulting load-deflection data were normalized and average stress- strain curves plotted for each test. In addition, the resulting injury severity was estimated immediately after impact using an injury scale of 1 to 5. A discussion of the injury mechanisms observed in the tests is given, and correlation between injury severity and the mechanical parameters of stress, strain, and strain energy produced in the tissue of the organ is presented. 730969. (P-51) Improved Laminated Windshield with Reduced Laceration Properties. S. E. Kay and J. Pickard, Triplex Safety Glass Co., Ltd. (Eng- land); and L. M. Patrick, Wayne State Univ. A new laminated automobile windshield called Triplex "Ten-Twenty," fabricated from two thermally stressed glass plies of 2.3 mm soda-lime float glass laminated with a 0.76 mm HPR polyvinyl butyral interlayer, has been biomechanically evaluated by Triplex Safety Glass Co., Ltd., using a dropping headform and a skull impactor, and by Wayne State University, using a 50th percentile anthropomorphic dummy on the WHAM III sled test facility. The results of these evaluations at velocities up to 60km/h are expressed in terms of Gadd index, head injury criterion, and various laceration scales including the new Triplex laceration index (TLI). Some details are also given of other properties of the windshield. The results of the evaluations indicate that the Ten-Twenty windshield offers a reduction of about two units on the TLI scale equivalent to one of the following: 1. A 99% reduction in the number of cuts when the length and depth of cuts remain unaltered. 2. A 90% reduction in the length of cuts when the number and depth of cuts remain unaltered. 3. A change in depth of cuts from one layer of skin simulation to another, but in particular a 78.5% reduction in the depth of cuts into the polyvinyl chloride base layer when the number and length of cuts remain unaltered. In practice, the length, number, and depth of cuts all change together so that one typical example taken from the test program of a two-unit reduction in TLI is: 1. A 62% reduction in the average depth of cuts into the polyvinyl chloride base. 2. A 27% reduction in the average length of cuts. 3. No increase in the total number of cuts. On the basis of these results, Ten-Twenty is a much safer laminated automobile windshield than those now commercially available due to decreased laceration to the occupants during a collision. 1973 SA E Transactions 730970. (P-51) Concussion Levels Determined by HPR Windshield Impacts. V. R. Hodgson and L. M. Thomas, Wayne State Univ.; and J. Brinn, Chrysler Corp. The purpose of this study was to increase our under- standing of the head impact level that will produce concussion in humans. The technique employed was that of accident restaging. The investigation reported here was composed of three parts: 1. The Cornell accident records were reexamined to establish the frequency of brain concussion as a function of windshield damage. 2. Tests were conducted with instrumented cadavers to determine the head accelerations achieved when the appropriate windshield damage levels were obtained. 3. Head injury indexes were calculated from the measured accelerations, and their predictions were com- pared to the Cornell field data. The present reexamination of the Cornell accident data found that the percentage of victims who received a concussion involving known unconsciousness reduces to, at most, 1 1% for the case of radial crack with bulge. The percentage obtained for radial crack - no bulge was, at most, 2.8%. Thus, the former condition is approximately four times as likely to produce a concussion as the latter condition. A number of head injury indexes were calculated from the cadaver head accelerations obtained in the current study. It would be expected that these should be somewhat greater for the bulged windshield condition than for the nonbulged condition. This was not found to be the case. The calculated criteria were either approx- imately equal or else greater for the no-bulge condition than the bulged condition. The reason for this disparity is not known. Most injury indexes treated the accelerations pro- duced by the cadaver/windshield impacts in a funda- mentally different way than accelerations produced by equivalent dummy impacts. For the cadaver data, the indexes focused on the spike caused by the glass breakage, whereas for dummy data, the indexes focused on the broad pulse resulting from the interlayer bulging. This difference arose from the fact that the cadavers produced lower accelerations during the bulge event than did dummies. 730971. (P-51) Improved Laminated Windscreens by Energy-Controlled Breakout. Martin Kramer, Berlin Technical Univ. A recently developed laminated windscreen offers amaz- 208</page><page sequence="132">ing improvement in safety performance compared to conventional laminated windshields by energy-controlled breakout at the fixed edge, working at an impact speed of more than 20 mph. The performance of the head impact against the windscreen as well as the energy reaction between the head and the screen were studied in some 70 tests. The impact velocity was raised from 15 to 37 mph, and the temperature of the windshields was varied between 278-308 K, in order to analyze the effect of velocity and temperature upon the parameters influencing the safety performance. All results are compared with those of a similar investigation on conventional laminated wind- shields (0.03 in HPR-interlayer) obtained earlier. With the newly designed windshields, resulting head decelerations are not essentially lower than those of the conventional type, but there is a smoother rise of the deceleration time-history due to breakoff at the edge. Above all, there are hardly any penetrations or long ruptures of the interlayer, compared to more than 50% with normal types. The very low amount of residual kinetic energy of the head after its impact onto the windshield indicates the improved safety performance, and this in fact results in preventing or at least minimizing head injuries during a following impact against outer body parts. 1973 SA E Transactions 730972. (P-51) Evaluation of Australian Child Restraints. David C. Herbert, Brian A. Vazey, James M. Wyllie, Rodney G. Vaughan and Vladimir Leitis, Dept. of Motor Transport (Australia). The dynamic performance of child restraints available in Australia is examined from engineering and medical points of view. Dynamic collision simulations were carried out with restraints having the approval of the Standards Asso- ciation of Australia. Frontal and side impacts were simulated to allow measurement of space requirements and appraisal of the forces applied to the passenger using each restraint. Strengths and weaknesses of the various types of device are explored and conclusions are reached about the crash protection available to children in Australia. 730973. (P-51) The GM Child Love Seat. John P. Makinen, N. Feles and L. P. Garvey, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Corp. This paper details the design and development of a new child restraint system recommended for children from 20-40 lb and under 40 in. The child is restrained in a seat by a five-belt harness system that utilizes a single quick-release buckle. The seat is restrained by the vehicle lap belts and a top anchor strap. It satisfactorily meets the standards of FMVSS 213 in static testing, and it reduces excursion of the child in front and side impact testing. The seat has padded forward-projecting walls at the side of the head. The seat retained its integrity during impact testing. 730972-730975 730974. (P-51) Matched Driver Restraint Systems. Frank A. DuWaldt, Calspan Corp. A major consideration for passive restraints is the accommodation of a range of driver masses in conjunc- tion with a range of impact speeds. A particular velocity-sensitive absorber is introduced that is intended to provide the required dissipation within currently recommended force limits. It is shown that retention of current typical compartment dimensions suggests that the stroke required at speeds near 60 mph will be difficult to accommodate. Illustrative examples of the velocity-sensitive restraint subjected to the deceleration pulse of a vehicle having an energy management structure are presented. The vehicles represented are those developed by Calspan Corp. under DOT sponsorship. They feature compartment integrity during impacts with fixed objects at speeds in excess of 50 mph. Special features of a candidate passive driver restraint system include a déployable hydraulic energy absorber of the type analyzed and an absorber that permits lateral motion of the occupant. Tentative conclusions of the study are: 1. Driver restraint systems effective for a range of driver masses (5% female to 95% male) can be developed. 2. Use of a velocity (and velocity squared) sensitive device can complicate the conventional view of ride-down enhancement. 3. Both passive and active systems can be made effective at speeds around 50 mph (within the constraints of current compartment dimensions). 4. Energy management vehicle structures - manda- tory for maintenance of compartment integrity - are compatible with postulated restraint characteristics. 1973 SA E Transactions 730975. (P-51) Cervical Range of Motion and Dynamic Response and Strength of Cervical Muscles. David R. Foust, Don B. Chaffin, Richard G. Snyder and Janet K. Baum, The Univ. of Michigan. Basic physical characteristics of the neck have been defined which have application to the design of bio- mechanical models, anthropometric dummies, and oc- cupant crash protection devices. The study was performed using a group of 180 volunteers chosen on the basis of sex, age (18-74 years), and stature. Measurements from each subject included anthropometry, cervical range-of-motion (observed with both x-rays and photographs), the dynamic response of the cervical flexor and extensor muscles to a controlled jerk, and the maximum voluntary strength of the cervical muscles. Data are presented in tabular and graphic form for total range-of-motion, cervical muscle reflex time, decelerations of the head, muscle activation time, and cervical muscle strength. The range-of-motion of females was found to average 1-12 deg greater than that of men, depending upon age, and a definite degradation in range-of-motion was observed with increasing age. Average neck muscle reflex 209</page><page sequence="133">730976-730980 times range from 56-92 ms for flexors and 54-87 ms for extensors, with males being generally slower-reacting. This finding means that the cervical muscles generally cannot be activated in sufficient time to mitigate the hyperextension effects of a surprise rear-end collision. Reflex time becomes significantly longer after middle e.g. in the range of 0.3-0.5 g. The time required to stop the head after initial detection of the muscle reflex was slightly longer for neck extensors. Strength tests revealed that males are on average stronger than females in both flexor and extensor strengths. Males and females also exhibit different aging characteristics, and a slight stature effect was noted for the younger and shorter portions of the population. Age and sex were found to be important factors in cervical flexibility and response characteristics, and they should be included whenever accurate representation of neck parameters is desired. 1973 SA E Transactions 730976. (P-51) Torque versus Angular Displacement Response of Human Head to -Gx Impact Accel- eration. C. L. Ewing and D. J. Thomas, Naval Aerospace Medical Research Lab. This paper discusses the results of a comparison of 41 previously reported test runs and human volunteer runs run by Mertz and Patrick in testing torque versus angular displacement response of the human head to -Gx impact acceleration. Due to different instrumentation and meas- uring techniques, there were several differences, but large portions of the data were comparable. The paper points out the need for anatomically based three-dimensional coordinate systems to permit quantitative comparisons between human subjects. 730977. (P-51) Spinal Loads Resulting from -Gx Accel- eration. P. C. Begeman, A. I. King and P. Prasad, Wayne State Univ. The biodynamic response of cadaver torsos subjected to -Gx impact acceleration is discussed in this paper, with particular emphasis on the response of the vertebral column. The existence of an axial force along the spine and its manifestation as a load on the seat pan are reported. Spinal curvature appears to be an important factor in the generation of this spine load. In anthro- pometric dummies, the spine load does not exist. Details of the testing and results are given, and the development of a mathematical model is shown. 730978. (P-51) Flash X-Ray Cinematography During Impact Injury. Stanley A. Shatsky, Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute. This paper discusses flash x-ray cinematography tech- niques and equipment used to record high-speed motions occurring during impact injury. Cineangiographic studies of the aortic arch, cardiac ventricle, and intracranial arteries are presented. The paper gives a brief review of x-ray cinematography systems and various high-speed applications of them, and the need for quantitative information of visceral and vascular movements during impact trauma is emphasized. 1973 SA E Transactions 730979. (P-51) Side Impact Tolerance to Blunt Trauma. R. L. Stalnaker, V. L. Roberts and J. H. McElhaney, Highway Safety Res. Inst., The Univ. of Michigan. The object of this research program has been to extend the scope of earlier work to include long-duration head impacts and to develop new scaling relationships to allow extrapolation of impact data from infrahuman primates to living humans. A series of living primate side impacts to the head and torso was conducted in parallel with a series of impacts to human cadavers. Dimensional analysis techniques were employed to estimate in vivo human tolerance to side injury. The threshold of closed brain injury to humans was found to be 76 g for a pulse duration of 20 ms and an impact velocity of 43 ft/s (13.2 m/s). The maximum tolerable penetration to the chest was found to be 2.65 in (6.72 cm) for both the left and right sides. Scaling of abdominal injuries to humans was accom- plished by employing a factor that relates impact contact area, animal mass, impact force, and pulse (Juration to injury severity. The maximum tolerable contact pressure to the upper abdomen of a human was found to be 32 lbf/in2 (220 kPa). 730980. (P-51) Computer Program for Reconstruction of Highway Accidents. Raymond R. McHenry, Calspan Corp. The Simulation Model of Automobile Collisions (SMAC) computer program has been developed for the purpose of achieving uniformity in the use of analytical techniques for interpretation of physical evidence in investigations of highway accidents. The comprehensive output informa- tion of the SMAC program (kinematics, tire tracks, and vehicle damage) permits extensive, detailed comparisons with physical evidence in the iterative runs used to achieve a "best fit," and the predicted vehicle responses provide a basis for relative refined categorization of occupant exposures. The generality included in the outputs of the SMAC program permits approximation of the effects of driver control inputs, damage to vehicle running gear, and traversal of terrain zones with different friction properties. The analytical approach is outlined, and specific assumptions are defined. Comparisons are presented between analytical predictions and results of staged collisions. In one of the presented applications to a staged collision, the initial conditions were kept unknown until completion of the reconstruction process. Results of sample applications to actual highway accidents are included. Computer graphics displays of reconstructed accidents, including rest positions, tracks, and damage, are presented. 210</page><page sequence="134">730981. (P-51) Thoracic Impact: New Experimental Approaches Leading to Model Synthesis. R. M. Schreck and D. C. Viano, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. The following work was done in support of a continuing program to better characterize the behavior of the human chest during blunt sternal impact. Previous work on this probelm has focused on determining the force-time, deflection-time, and force-deflection response of embalm- ed and fresh cadavers to impact by a 15 cm (6 in) diameter striker of variable mass traveling at velocities of 22.5-51 km/h (14-32 mph) and striking the sternum at the level of the fourth intercostal space. Additional questions persist concerning whether the anterior and posterior regions of the chest behave as highly damped masses or oscillate after impact, the relationship between force delivered to the surface of the body and the acceleration of the underlying regions, and the influence of air compressed in the lung on thoracic mechanics. Experiments were performed, using the carcasses of freshly sacrificed swine (sus scrofa), on which accel- erometers were fastened to the sternum and backbone at the level of the fourth intercostal space. The carcasses were then impacted by a ram in the manner of the previous cadaver work, subjected to short-duration, free-vibration impacts to the sternum, and dropped into a shallow pool of water from heights up to 9.1 m (30 ft) to simulate the severe frontal impact sustained by a stunt driver. The acceleration ratios were noted, and the acceleration traces were integrated to obtain chest deflection and Fourier analyzed for harmonic content. The air pressure in the lung was also monitored during one series of ram and free-vibration experiments. 730982. (P-51) Mechanical Simulation of Human Thorax Under Impact. R. F. Neathery and T. E. Lobdell, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. This paper summarizes an analysis, design, and test project in which a dummy chest structure was developed. The chest consisted of mechanical elements that had been characterized by computer simulations as giving responses to blunt frontal impacts necessary for biofidelity. An analysis of mechanical rib structures indicated that materials having a high ratio of yield stress to modulus of elasticity were required. Only metals having unusually high yield strengths, such as spring steels, qualified. A mechanical system was developed with steel ribs pi- voted at each end as a primary spring. A secondary spring was a pair of commercially available die springs acting in parallel with the ribs after 25.4 mm (1.00 in) deflection. A fluid damper was developed to provide the damping. The chest structure was tested under conditions modified from those used by Kroell. The modifications were holding the spine rigidly and reducing the impact masses. The response of the mechanical system was similar to that predicted by the mathematical model. It satisfied the 4.92 m/s (1 1 mph) response corridor and was very near the 7.15 m/s (16 mph) corridor. Further 730981-730985 adjustments are necessary to adapt the chest to a crash test dummy. The chest must still be tested as part of the total dummy structure under the impact conditions specified by Kroell. Testing under these conditions is necessary, but not sufficient, to assure biofidelity. 730983. (P-51) A New Crash Test Device - "Repeatable Pete". James H. McElhaney and Peter I. Mate, National Driver Center; and Verne L. Roberts, Highway Safety Research Inst., The Univ. of Michigan. A new crash test device has been developed, called "Repeatable Pete." It is a repeatable, durable anthro- pomorphic dummy with humanlike dynamic perform- ance. This paper describes the device and gives details of its design and performance during testing in automotive situations. The head, neck, and chest match the latest biomechanical information on the dynamic responses of unembalmed cadavers. The head e.g. accelerations ade- quately match the skull acceleration, so that head injury criteria based upon cadaver skull acceleration may be used. 730984. (P-51) Femur Load Injury Criteria - A Realistic Approach. John J. King, William R. S. Fan and Raymond J. Vargovick, Ford Motor Co. The analysis presented in this paper indicates that while 1700 lbf (7560 N) is a realistic femur fracture load for 30-50 ms duration impacts, the human femur can withstand higher loads for shorter-duration impacts. Experimental femur fracture data from cadaver and bone specimen tests are reviewed. These data are used to develop femur load fracture tolerance as a function of impact duration. On the basis of a measured 10% amplification of 1-2 ms input forced by the dummy, the cadaver fracture tolerance is proportionately adjusted to arrive at equiv- alent load levels for forces measured on current dummy test devices. Experimental dummy test device data are included and compared to the theoretical response of a mathe- matical model of the human upper leg. This comparison demonstrates that even neglecting the 10% amplification, there are still significant differences in the response of dummy and human upper leg structures for impact durations less than 3 ms. 730985. (P-51) Mass, Volume, Center of Mass, and Mass Moment of Inertia of Head and Head and Neck of Human Body. Leon B. Walker, Jr., Edward H. Harris and Uwe R. Pontius, Tulane Univer- sity. The mass, volume, center of mass, and mass moment of inertia of the head and the head and neck were determined for 20 human male cadavers. Anthropometric values and anatomic landmarks were obtained by external measurements and by use of x-ray procedures. The procedures used to determine the above measurements are described. Uniform planes for the separation of the head 211</page><page sequence="135">730986-730990 and neck from the torso and separation of the head from the neck were established and are described in detail. The values of the physical properties of the head and neck and the head are tabulated and compared to data reported in previous studies. 730986. Fluid Power and Control Requirements for the Space Shuttle Orbiting Vehicle. Vernon Mc- Gillen and Bernhard Rosenbaum, Rockwell International. The Space Shuttle Orbiter vehicle is a combination space- craft and aircraft which can remain in orbit for seven days, fly horizontally, and land on existing SAC type air- port runways. The vehicle utilizes gimbaling of the main rocket engines and rudder control during ascent, and aerodynamic surfaces for control during reentry, ap- proach, and landing. A hydraulic system was selected for acutation of those controls and for actuation of the land- ing gear, brakes, steering, and main engine control valves. This paper discusses system characteristics, power requirements, and maintenance features of the Orbiter hydraulic system. The system selected offers a high degree of redundancy, minimizes weight and system complexity and yields time and cost savings, thus meeting the design goal of providing vehicle reliability and serviceability comparable to aviation standards. 730987. Flight Control System Advances for Near-Future Military Aircraft. Paul E. Blatt, U. S. Air Force Flight Dynamics Lab. Advanced flight control concepts are expected to result in major design changes to the total vehicle configuration and to significantly improve the total mission effectiveness of near-future military aircraft. Fly-by-wire controls have been the catalyst which makes these advancements possible. Realistic appraisal of the current state-of-the-art in analog fly-by-wire controls and the major thrust to develop digital controls are presented. 1973 SAE Transactions 730988. Fluid Power and Control Requirements for the U.S. Army Heavy Lift Helicopter. Thomas P. Peppier, Boeing Vertol Co. This paper is a summary of the characteristics and development program for the U.S. Army heavy lift helicopter fly-by-wire flight control system. The evolved control system consists of a triple channel direct electrical linkage which replaces the mechanical controls between the cockpit and the rotor control actuators and a triplex digital automatic flight control system. The direct electrical linkage has been successfully tested in a demonstration helicopter. The test helicopter utilized triple hydraulic driver actuators to control existing power actuators. In the heavy lift helicopter, the driver and power functions will be integrated into a single rotor control actuator consisting of a triple control stage and dual power stage. Transmission- driven dual hydraulic systems at each rotor head supply the two power stages and two of the control stages. A separate electrically driven hydraulic pump supplies the third section of the triplex control stage. Hydraulic power for flight control operation when rotors are not turning is supplied by two pumps at each rotor head driven by an auxiliary power unit and the aforementioned electrical pump. Hydraulic system redundancy is enhanced by interconnections between forward and aft rotor heads. The interconnecting lines are normally closed by shutoff valves which open in case of a failure at either rotor head. 1973 SA E Transactions 730989. New Chemical Surface Treatments for Processing Titanium. R. H. Shoemaker, Kolene Corp. This paper examines methods of removing lubricant residues (C,MoS2), oxides (Ti02) and ceramic coatings (Si02) from heat treated or hot formed titanium sections. Work handling systems for high production cleaning and descaling depend upon consistent rapid removal of these contaminants. Diffusion bonding techniques where complete removal of oxygen effected areas is necessary requires special consideration. Chemical milling selectively attacks sur- faces that are not uniformly cleaned. The resulting cratered surface is unsatisfactory for additional opera- tions. Conditioning and treatment cycles prior to effective gage removal are tabulated. The final phase of surface treatment discussed is a liquid nitriding process performed at 1480°F (805°C) The treatment develops a 0.001-0.002 in (0.025-0.050mm) wear resistant surface on titanium alloys. Treatment time is 2 hs, which effectively reduces gall and wear problems characteristic of titanium. The lower coefficient of friction developed in the treated surface is a decided advantage where mating titanium parts are subject to frictional wear. 730990. Energy and the Automobile. J. C. Ellis, 1973 SAE President. The economy of the United States and of other developed nations in the world is energy-intensive and societies in these countries are mobile. Furthermore, world energy consumption and mobility are increasing. These increases result from public demand; society sets the pattern for growth. Much of this demand for increased mobility will be satisfied by the automobile and the requisite energy by the gasoline which fuels it. However, concern over the role of the automobile as a contributor of atmospheric pollutants and the early imposition of restrictive exhaust emission standards, particularly in the United States, is leading to a critical predicament. This is a consequence of the increased volumes of fuel required for engines and control systems being developed to meet the standards and a growing supply problem for gasoline derived from fossil fuels. Although the final chapter of this saga is not written, this paper attempts to provide an over-view of this worrisome energy situation and its possible impact on automotive engineering. 1973 SAE Transactions 212</page></plain_text>
