<plain_text><page sequence="1">Adaptational Functional Ascriptions in Evolutionary Biology: A Critique of Schaffner's Views* William A. Rottschaefert Department of Philosophy, Lewis and Clark College Kenneth Schaffner has argued that evolutionary theory, strictly understood, cannot support the functional ascriptions used in adaptational functional explanations. Al- though the causal ascription clause in these ascriptions is supported, the goal-ascription clause cannot be, since it imports anthropocentric features deriving from a vulgar un- derstanding of evolutionary theory. I argue that an etiological interpretation of selec- tional explanations sanctions both the causal and goal-ascription clauses of functional ascriptions and provides a way to understand teleological explanation within evolu- tionary biology. 1. Kenneth Schaffner (1993) has recently returned to an enduring con- troversy concerning the import of teleological descriptions and expla- nations in evolutionary biology (Lennox 1992, 1994; Ghiselin 1992). Schaffner argues that although explications of goal-directed behavior and functions require the ascriptions of goals or ends, evolutionary theory strictly understood cannot support such ascriptions.1 Conse- quently, such ascriptions are not explanatory and serve only a heuristic function. Indeed, as biologists attain a deeper knowledge of the causes of evolution, the ascription of functions and goals will become less useful and is in-principle eliminable.

Schaffner often speaks in terms of evolutionary theory when it seems clear from the context that he intends not merely evolutionary theory, i. e., the theory that descent with modification has occurred, but also evolution by means of natural selection.

Indeed, I shall contend that evolutionarily-based functional adaptational ascriptions provide good justification for the claims that organisms are sometimes up to something and that that something is sometimes good or bad for them. Schaffner discusses adaptational functional ascriptions within the context of his larger study of the uses of not only functional but also teleological and goal-directed descriptions and explanations in the bio- medical sciences. Schaffner (1993, 403-405; 409-410; hereinafter, all page references will be to this work) argues that both of these sorts of descriptions and explanations, as well as the various philosophical analyses of them, reveal a common pattern of causal and goal clauses describing, roughly, what a thing does and what it is for. He proceeds by arguing that although the goal clause is ineliminable from func- tional, teleological, and goal-directed descriptions and explanations, it is, nevertheless, empirically unsupported in the biomedical sciences.2 This lack of scientific support leads Schaffner to conclude that teleo- logical phenomena are irreducible to purely causal phenomena and, thus, in-principle, eliminable from scientific discourse. A more neutral way than Schaffner's of framing the issue would be to consider the two clauses as responses in the first instance to two "simply" causal questions about (1) what does the thing in question do and (2) why is it there.3 The teleologist can then proceed to make her case that in some instances the answer to the second question is teleological in some specified sense, for instance, as I shall argue below, that a thing is there because of what it does. Although I think this way of posing the problem comes much closer to being neutral about the phenomena in question than does Schaffner's, I accept Schaffner's formulation of the issue in part because it poses the challenge to a naturalistic advocate of teleology so sharply. I proceed by examining various formulations of Schaffner's claim that natural selection expla- 2. More precisely, Schaffner (388-389) distinguishes between a primary and secondary sense of biological function. The primary sense requires some appeal to a role in evo- lution and the secondary to some form of usefulness with respect to maintenance and enhancement of life activities. Each use involves a causal and a goal clause. Schaffner argues that currently the causal clause of the primary sense is poorly supported because of the multiple gaps in most evolutionary accounts of adaptational functions. However, the causal clause in the secondary sense of biological function can and does obtain in some instances strong empirical support in laboratory or field work. But Schaffner denies that the goal clause in either the primary or the secondary senses of function is supported empirically. In Schaffner's view the goal clauses of teleological and goal- directed descriptions and explanations are similarly lacking in empirical support (409-410). 3. I owe this suggestion on how to pose the problem to an anonymous referee. 699</page><page sequence="3">WILLIAM A. ROTTSCHAEFER nations do not support the teleological aspect of functional adapta- tional ascriptions. 2. In addressing Schaffner's challenge, I shall consider adaptational functional ascriptions, using the widely discussed, criticized and em- ployed etiological analysis of such ascription.4 Since Larry Wright's (1973, 1976) seminal rendition of it, the etiological analysis has been refined in various ways to fit selectional explanations more precisely. Crucial refinements have been made (1) to distinguish genuine from accidental functions, and functions due to natural selection from those due to other sources; (2) to specify whether the trait in question was originally and/or is recently or currently selected for; (3) to explicate the extent to which selection has played a role in the trait's origin or maintenance.5 Without making use of these refinements at the moment, consider the following application of Wright's account to adaptations: The function of adaptation A in organism S is to do Y in environ- ment E if and only if (1) A tends to do Y in E and thus tends to bring about the differ- ential survival and reproduction of S's and 4. Schaffner (Ch. 8) himself offers an extensive discussion of analyses of teleology and functions in modern philosophy of biology, including the etiological analysis of adap- tational functional ascriptions. In their own recent discussions of the etiological account Kitcher (1993) and Godfrey-Smith (1994) provide overviews of the literature on the adequacy of the etiological account for explicating biological, in particular, adapta- tional functions. I follow their helpful summaries in my own discussion of the major modifications of the etiological account of function claimed by many commentators to be necessary in order for that account to fit adaptational functions. 5. For my purposes, I assume, as does Schaffner, that it has been satisfactorily estab- lished that refinements of Wright's analysis are sufficient to distinguish genuine from accidental functions, and functions due to natural selection from those due to other sources. It will not be necessary to enter into the further questions pursued by Kitcher (1993), Godfrey Smith (1994), and others concerning whether the functional trait in question was originally and/or is recently or currently selected for nor to explicate the extent to which selection has played a role in the trait's origin or maintenance. Although Robert Cummins (1975) proposed his analysis of biological function (that ascriptions of function indicate the role that a component plays in a larger system that exhibits a more complex effect) as a rival to the etiological account, I shall follow Millikan (1989), Kitcher (1993), and Godfrey-Smith (1994) in viewing the two accounts as compatible. Schaffner finds Cummins' account of biological function inadequate because it assumes, he believes, that biologically useful functions can be picked out for component analyses. Schaffner argues that the concept of biological usefulness is ultimately dependent on some evolutionary role for the capacity in question. Thus, he argues that Cummins analysis cannot in the long run escape the kind of criticism that he, Schaffner, levels against functional adaptational ascriptions. 700</page><page sequence="4">A CRITIQUE OF SCHAFFNER'S VIEWS (2) A is there in S because it tends to do Y in E and thus tends to bring about differential survival and reproduction. Schaffner identifies the first clause as the causal clause and the second as the goal-ascription clause. For example, applying this analysis to the camouflage adaptation of the moth, the causal clause reads (1) In industrial areas melanic moths' adaptation of dark skin coloring tends to enable them to avoid increased predation (and thus tends to bring about increased survival and reproduction) and the goal-ascription clause reads (2) the melanic moths have the adaptation of dark skin coloring because it (the adaptation) tends to enable the avoidance of increased predation and consequently tends to bring about increased survival and reproduction. Schaffner (364, 398-403, and elsewhere in Chapter 8) argues that an adequate analysis of functional ascriptions requires both the causal and goal clauses; but a strict explanation of evolution by natural selection sanctions only the causal clause, not the goal clause. He contends that the goal clause illegitimately introduces elements of human intentional activity into selectional explanations and is based on a vulgar under- standing of evolutionary theory (393). Evolution by natural selection requires (1) phenotypic variation; (2) heritable phenotypic variation, (3) differential survival and reproduction; and (4) differences in phe- notypic fitnesses due to different adaptations within a common select- ing environment (Brandon 1990). However, Vulgarians incorrectly consider evolution by natural selection to be an optimization process or a process that has an end or ends. Without these supposed supports from evolutionary theory, they are left with nothing but anthropo- morphic projection that has no descriptive basis or explanatory force (375-379).6 6. Schaffner (384-385) also offers an extended example of an idealized adaptation/ selection machine, the "cloner." He argues that although the machine's operation can be given an adaptational functional description, intuition tells us its operation is entirely mechanical. The example, he argues, illustrates what completed, strict evolutionary accounts of functional adaptational ascriptions will look like. These accounts will have no use for goal ascriptions. It seems to me that Schaffner's example fails to make his point. Not only can intuitions about cloner's adequacy for representing a biological organism differ but also Schaffner's extrapolation from the example to functional as- criptions in biology can be questioned. However, setting those qualms aside, Schaffner's Vulgarians can concede that selection machines can be made, but argue that that con- cession does not necessarily have any implications for the explanatory power of the goal ascription clause in functional ascriptions. An adequate functional ascription re- quires more than an appeal to what the trait accomplishes, it requires an explanation of why the trait is there to begin with. As we shall see below, the causal-clause provides only the former, the goal-clause is needed for the latter. Finally, I would argue that modifying the cloner example, as Schaffner (558, n. 19) does in order to meet an ob- 701</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAM A. ROTTSCHAEFER But the teleologist replies that the conditions demanded by Schaffner for the ascription of a goal to human activity are too strong. Conse- quently, the failure of evolution by natural selection to meet these cri- teria does not lead to the conclusion that the goal clause of functional adaptational ascriptions is not supported by evolutionary theory. As- cription of a goal to human activity does not require that humans have one overall goal or even some small number. Moreover, there are a number of ways to pursue intentionally one's goals without seeking to optimize some result; for instance, one can seek a goal in such a way as to minimize costs. Humans have and achieve multiply diverse goals in a number of different fashions. Yet Schaffner considers human ac- tions to be paradigmatically teleological. Thus, if the model for teleo- logical action is human action, the fact that evolution by natural se- lection involves processes that achieve neither some one overall end nor do so by optimizing does not preclude them from being correctly described as teleological. Moreover, it is not a necessary condition for the ascription of evolution by natural selection to a process that it achieve some one result, one overall result, or just a few results. Nor is it necessary that natural selection be a maximization process. Ad- vocates of teleology agree with the critics of progressivist and adap- tationist accounts of selectional explanations that evolution by natural selection never, or seldom, achieves either a single or small set of ends and that it does not necessarily do so by some process of optimization. On the other hand, they also contend that, given evolution by natural selection, some organisms outperform others with respect to survival and reproduction because of the relevant differences in their adapta- tions (Kitcher 1987, Orzack and Sober 1994). In each case some specific goal or other is attained.7 Because of their coloration, dark-colored moths survive and reproduce in greater numbers than their lighter- colored cousins in the industrial areas of Great Britain after 1850. In each case of natural selection something is achieved by means of the adaptations involved in the selection process. Consequently, showing that evolution by natural selection neither attains some overall results nor optimizes the results it does attain does not establish that particular selection processes have no particular ends or goals. They do achieve something. There is selection for various adaptations that serve such ends as avoidance of predation and the finding of a mate. Moreover, because adaptations achieve such ends, they promote differential sur- vival and reproduction.8 jection of Wimsatt, introduces exactly what is needed to justify the ascription of goals, that is, a selectional explanation of why the trait in question is present. 7. I thank an anonymous referee for this clarification of my point. 8. I thank Jim Lennox for helping me to clarify this point. 702</page><page sequence="6">A CRITIQUE OF SCHAFFNER'S VIEWS 3. But is not even this sort of guarded formulation of the function of adaptations still supported by a hidden anthropomorphism? Schaffner claims that it is. If so, the goal-clause of the functional analysis of adaptations is not supported by the theory of evolution by natural selection. Roughly, what Schaffner (373, 387-389) has in mind is that Vulgarians think of nature as acting in a manner analogous to inten- tional human activity. Thinking in this way facilitates a number of heuristic and cognitive ends (for instance, drawing attention to key empirical issues, organizing one's thoughts, and suggesting hypotheses about adaptive mechanisms), but it should not be confused, Schaffner argues (390-391), with what the theory strictly allows. Effects do occur, but these effects are neither intended nor chosen. They are in no sense goals. Alternative paths for achieving an effect are present; and one is followed while the other(s) are not; or, perhaps, both are taken at dif- ferent times with differing results. Strict selectional explanations allow that, but no more. Vulgarians confuse the presence of an effect, a con- sequence, differential survival and reproduction, with the presence of an end or goal. Schaffner has identified another sort of causal fallacy. If he is correct, we should argue that it is important in thinking about causal matters not only to avoid mistaking temporal for causal ante- cedents (the fallacy of post hoc, ergo propter hoc) but also to beware of the fallacy of confusing effects with ends or goals (379), what we might call the teleological fallacy. In other words, Schaffner argues that the Vulgarians do not distinguish sufficiently the teleological 'because' of the goal-ascription clause from the efficient causality of the causal clause. The causal clause indicates that an adaptation has certain ef- fects. Selectional explanations strictly construed allow that ascription. The second clause makes that effect nature's goal; at this point Vul- garians anthropomorphize and fall into error. To evaluate this argument, consider an explicitly etiological refor- mulation of functional ascription in the case of an adaptation: The function of adaptation A in organism S is to do Y in environ- ment E if and only if (1) S's having A in E tends to lead to Y and thus tends to increase the chances of S's differential survival and reproduction, and (2') S has A in E at present because S's having A in E in the past tended to lead to Y and thus to the differential survival and reproduction of S's in the past. The etiological reformulation makes explicit the historical element in adaptational functional explanations. This can be seen by examining the reformulated goal-ascription clause, (2'). While the intent of the 703</page><page sequence="7">WILLIAM A. ROTTSCHAEFER causal clause is to explain the effects produced currently by S's adap- tation, the goal clause concerns the etiology of the adaptation, that is, it answers the question why the adaptation is present. The answer to that question is an historical one, that predecessors of A have been selected for precisely because of the role that A played in their lives with regard to obtaining Y and, ultimately, in their survival and re- production. But given this reformulation, the goal-ascription clause refers to instantiations of the process of natural selection. Thus Schaff- ner's claim that the goal-ascription clause is not supported by the the- ory of evolution by natural selection fails. 4. But even if this point is granted, what does the second clause in the functional account of an adaptation add? Is it not deprived of all its teleological force? Given the etiological interpretation, Schaffner can object to allowing selectional explanations to serve as a justifying "filler" in the schematic sentence: (2*) "A is there because . ..." In other words, he can argue that the filling demands more than can be supported by the reference to the past selection of S's with As. The 'because' demands a kind of causality analogous to intentional activity, and selectional explanations strictly interpreted do not involve that kind of causality. Under the etiological interpretation, the 'because' in the goal clause becomes purely causal.9 The only difference is that (2') refers to past instantiations of that process. The presence of A's in the subsequent generations is explained by S's having A's in the past. Thus Schaffner can allow that the second clause does explain something that the first does not, namely, why the S's which have A's that bring about Y's are present, but also maintain that under the etiological interpre- tation there is nothing distinctive about the causality of the goal- ascription in the second clause. The support gained from an etiological reformulation of adaptational functional explanation is bought at the price of the teleology. The two clauses merely represent an extended line of mechanical or efficient causality; teleology has been reduced or eliminated.10 9. Schaffner (296-302) offers a complex account of explanation such that theoretical explanation involves a reference to causal processes and mechanisms. After examining various explications of the concept of 'cause', Schaffner settles on the explication that, taken generally, 'cause' means a necessary condition for an effect in a given context. For complex situations, like those involved with claims about natural selection, Schaff- ner adopts Mackie's (1974) understanding of cause as an INUS condition, that is, as an insufficient, but necessary part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition. He con- tends that regularities involving these sorts of conditions are able to support counter- factual claims and subjunctive conditionals. 10. Here the use of different terminology causes confusion. As is well known, Aristotle distinguished four sorts of causal factors, material, formal, efficient, and final. In the 704</page><page sequence="8">A CRITIQUE OF SCHAFFNER'S VIEWS In response to this objection, I shall contend that an etiological un- derstanding of adaptational functional ascriptions and explanations retains a teleological feature. I shall do this by showing that there is a structural similarity between intentional, goal-directed, and functional activities and processes that unifies these forms of description and ex- planation and distinguishes them from the efficient or mechanical cau- sality expressed in the causal clause. 1 This structural similarity involves an appeal to successful consequences. Consider, first, intentional activ- ity. In behavior that is directed toward an end intentionally, the subject S conceives of a goal G and determines an appropriate means M to that goal. When we ask S why she is performing some behavior B, she responds that she wants to achieve G and that she believes that by doing B (and, possibly, by doing auxiliary behaviors, bl, b2, etc. to obtain subgoals gl, g2, etc.) that she will achieve her end. Of course, she is not claiming that some future event, the realization of her goal, is acting in the present, moving her to the realization of that yet to be event. Rather, her cognitively grasped future goal is motivating her behavior. The behavior is there because of these current cognitive ac- tivities. The anticipated future is an antecedent of the current behavior which, if successful, will realize that anticipated future in fact. But, unlike an adaptation which results from genetic endowment transferred to the possessor of the adaptation, S's cognitively grasped and moti- vated goals have arisen in S's lifetime and are part of her cognitive learning history. Thus we can give an etiological analysis of intentional activity as follows: seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Aristotelean final causality was rooted out of phys- ics. Mechanical causality ruled physics; teleology played a role in biological explana- tions. These are sometimes said to correspond roughly to Aristotelean efficient and final causality. Although some have argued that Darwin took teleology out of biology, it seems quite clear that what he removed from biology was the need for what has come to be called extrinsic teleology, the accomplishing of ends extrinsic to the organism, most famously, the ends of the creator. But Darwin, it is argued, shored up the role of intrinsic teleology. Those who support this sort of account of Darwin's contribution via his theory of evolution by natural selection, sometimes contrast teleological expla- nations with mechanical explanations (Lennox 1992); others speak of etiological or historical explanation as opposed to mechanical (Wright 1976, Kitcher 1993, Godfrey- Smith 1994); still others make teleology a type of mechanical explanation (Brandon 1990). An anonymous referee suggests that etiology be used as the broader category that includes both "simply" causal etiologies and teleological etiologies as different kinds of etiology. Below I distinguish mechanical or efficient causality from teleological or final causality. 11. Shortly before completing my analysis of Schaffner I discovered that Sandra Mitch- ell (1989) had taken a similar approach to critiquing a then unpublished version of Schaffner's claims and had arrived at conclusions similar to mine. 705</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAM A. ROTTSCHAEFER S intentionally does B in order to achieve G means that (1) S's cognitive and motivational capacities to seek G by doing B tend to achieve G; and (2) S's capacities to seek G by doing B are present because they have in S's past cognitive learning history tended to achieve G.12 On the other hand, consider S's behavior under a schedule of reinforce- ment. Here S may not be aware of her goal or only unreflectively and vaguely so. Nevertheless, besides current stimuli, her behavior is guided by a learning history in which positive reinforcers have followed certain behaviors in a given context. So, if we ask the question why is S doing B, we can respond that she is doing so because it tends to achieve G. Thus we can give the following sort of etiological analysis of her goal- directed behavior: S does B with the goal of achieving G means that (1) S's learned capacity to seek G by doing B tends to accomplish G and (2) S's learned capacity is present because it has tended to accom- plish G in S's previous reinforcement history. Because it has accomplished G in the past, S now possesses a learning history that leads her to seek a future possession of G. Thus the etiological analyses of intentional actions, goal-directed behaviors (based on past reinforcement) and functions based on ad- aptations all display a common teleological structure. That structure has the following form: (1) Capacity X tends to bring about effect Y and (2) X is there because in the past X has often been successful in bringing about Y. The causal clause, (1), refers to the current causal activity of capacity X in bringing about Y, and the goal clause, (2), to the presence of X because of its past successful causal activity in bringing about Y. In each type of teleological process, the disposition or capacity is present due in part, at least, to past successful performances. Thus, we can discern several ways in which the goal clause of the functional ascription adds to the so-called causal clause. First, the goal clause offers an explanation of the presence of the capacity by means 12. Mitchell (1989) argues for a weaker form of structural similarity by allowing an explanatory account of the origin of a cognitive capacity to rest on a mere occurrent belief that B will attain G rather than requiring that a belief have some record of success. 706</page><page sequence="10">A CRITIQUE OF SCHAFFNER'S VIEWS of which the behavior/goal or function/effect ascribed in the causal clause occurs. The causal clause says nothing about the question of the origin of this capacity. Given this difference in explananda between the two clauses, it is clear that Schaffner's (389-390, 398, 409-410) claim about the inverse relationship between the explanatory power of an- swers to the first question and the second question lacks support and appears to be false. Increased detail in answering the first question is independent of achieving better answers for the second and vice versa. Second, the explanation of the capacity's origin, presence or mainte- nance is in various degrees and aspects historical, but the explanation in the causal clause of how the capacity currently brings about its effect is not. Thirdly, the goal clause has a selectional structure absent in the causal clause. It is the very past successes of the capacity which play a role in the explanation of the origin, presence and maintenance of that capacity.13 A selection process is responsible for each type of teleolog- ical capacity in question, whether it be an adaptation, a non-cognitive behavioral capacity or an intentional capacity.14 In each case, a trait or capacity is selected for from a range of possibilities on the basis of varying selection criteria. Capacities and processes that in the past have been successful in the achievement of certain effects are embodied in the agent to various degrees. This last feature brings out most clearly the teleological feature of the goal-ascription clause. Schaffner restricts without justification the mode of operation of the cause of the presence of the current capacity to intentional activity. One can grant that the use of intentional capacities is one teleologically-based means for suc- cessfully achieving effects without conceding that it is the only mode. Thus it is appropriate to revise Schaffner's description of the clauses involved in functional analyses so that the first clause is referred to as the mechanical or efficient causality clause and the second clause as the teleological or final causality clause. It is helpful to note how past successful actualizations are incopor- ated into these teleological capacites at different temporal and agential depths. Adaptational functions have sources in the successes of previ- 13. This feature also seems to distinguish functional ascriptions involving selection mechanisms from "feedback" or homeostatic mechanisms sometimes invoked to ex- plain the goal-directed behavior of directively organized systems. In these cases, al- though the consequences of a system's activities do affect it, they do not necessarily do so in a selectional fashion. Rather the consequences of the system's activities may merely be coordinated with other factors that by feedback keep the system within given bounds, for instance, or move it along a prescribed track. 14. Selection processes operative in the social and cultural environments must be ac- corded a significant role in the acquisition, presence, or maintenance of many cognitive, motivational, and behavioral capacities. 707</page><page sequence="11">WILLIAM A. ROTTSCHAEFER ous generations and thus have the greatest degree of temporal depth and, because of their genetic bases, agential depth, that is, relative per- manence and lack of plasticity. Non-cognitive learned behavioral ca- pacities arise and develop during the life of the individual and probably in some instances prior to the intentional capacities of cognitive agency. Thus they have greater temporal depth than the latter, and, perhaps, because of their genetic and developmental dependencies, greater agen- tial depth. They are less plastic and less able to adjust to what current experience might indicate as a successful mode of action than are the capacities for intentional agency. These latter have the least temporal and agential depth, but the greatest plasticity. But even the intentional teleological capacities vary in the degree of their dependence upon past successes for their existence and operation. There can be importantly different relationships of S's goals to her cognitive learning history. Some goals, for instance, habitual ones, are more imbedded in past successes than others that are relatively recently conceived and sought after. Other goals, though recently conceived-for instance, those that are the results of instruction or imitation-probably have stronger con- nections to the past and the successes of others than to S's own recent personal successes. Still other goals have a less tenuous relationship with an agent's past successful activity, being, in part, imaginatively constructed and, perhaps, not yet pursued. Consequently, the degree to which past successes play a role in the presence and operation of current cognitive or intentional capacities varies. Thus I conclude that a genuinely teleological feature is captured in the etiological account of adaptational functional ascriptions and such ascriptions are supported by natural selection explanations. 5. Schaffner (374, 379, 403-405) also suggests a top-down argument for the irreducibility of goal-ascriptions to causal talk and thus, in his view, for the inability of natural selection theory-a strictly causal the- ory-to support the goal-ascription clause in functional ascriptions. He finds in attempts to attribute ends or goals to what natural selection effects a fallacy that he considers analogous to the open question ver- sion of the naturalistic fallacy proposed by G. E. Moore (1903). The open question argument purports to show that any attempt to identify the good with a natural property is fallacious. Although he does not develop the analogy at length, what he seems to have in mind is what I have called the teleological fallacy. So, in a manner similar to the open question procedure for exposing the naturalistic fallacy, the skep- tic opines that, for any proposed identification of a given effect as a goal, he can always ask why is that effect a goal-and it is expected that that question will remain unanswered. A reason for this, one can 708</page><page sequence="12">A CRITIQUE OF SCHAFFNER'S VIEWS argue, is that the concept of being a goal is essentially distinct from that of being an effect. Or to put it ontologically, the property of being a goal is essentially different from that of being an effect. As is well known, Moore argued his case on linguistic grounds. However, since Moore's time these grounds have been shaken by the undermining of the distinction between analytic and synthetic meanings. Thus Schaff- ner does not support the distinction between effect and goal on the basis of a conceptual difference grounded in analytic meanings. He contends that the issue revolves around a question of empirical mean- ings (379-380). But if so, then we can grant that skeptics enthralled by logical possibilities will always have the option of keeping a question open. Nevertheless, granting ordinary and scientific empirical input, it is clear that although it is not always the case that effects are goals, it is indeed sometimes the case that they are. Some effects turn out to be goals. Of course, that is not to say that what it means to be an effect is the same as what it means to be a goal. But it is to deny that an identification of an effect as a goal of a behavior or function is always incorrect, a fallacy. Whether the identification is successful or faulty depends upon empirical issues and cannot be decided a priori. But, if that is the case, then, given the adequacy of my argument that the processes of natural selection can be used to support the goal clause of adaptational functional ascriptions, Schaffner's top-down argument fails. 5 6. Finally, the presence an of ineliminable teleological feature in evolutionarily-supported adaptational selectional ascriptions has im- plications for a naturalistic account of the good and provides grounds for contending that Schaffner's (379-380) appeal to the naturalistic fallacy is itself suspect. Thus far I have not used an important part of adaptational functional ascriptions based on selectional explanations. This part can go a long ways toward showing not only that organisms are on occasion up to something, but also that that something can be good or bad for them and others.16 We can supplement the explicitly etiological analysis of adaptational functions with another clause as follows: 15. I agree with the comment of an anonymous referee who points out that if effects were always goals it would be difficult to distinguish mere effects from goals and that the distinction between between effects that are and are not goals is useful precisely because some effects are not goals. Wright (1976) argues persuasively for the empirical accessibility of goals as opposed to mere effects. 16. Brandon (1990) makes a similar sort of suggestion. 709</page><page sequence="13">WILLIAM A. ROTTSCHAEFER (3) Having A in E allows S's to do better than T's which have trait B. This claim states that S's better achieve an adaptive effect than the T's as measured in terms of survival and reproduction because, having A, they are better adapted than the T's in their common E. Any genuinely adaptational account of a capacity must necessarily have this clause which asserts an assessment of adaptations relative to the obtaining of a certain behavioral effect, camouflage and resultant protection from predators, for instance. The ultimate criteria in terms of which this comparative assessment is made are, of course, survival and reproduc- tion. Consequently (3) introduces a naturalistic explication of the good. Whether this explication is cashed out by means of a Nagelian reduc- tion or in terms of supervenience or emergence, it is clear that adap- tational functional ascriptions have built into them the concept of something being for the sake of, for the benefit of, or for the enhance- ment of its bearer or something else. In our original example, the wing coloration benefits directly one population of moths over another in a given selecting environment in terms of differential survival. It conse- quently benefits another generation via differential reproduction. But what is good about reproduction and survival? And what is good about the reproduction and survival of moths of type A, of other nonhuman species or, for that matter, humans? Schaffner argues that talk of goals and their fulfillment is imported from the outside into adaptational functional ascriptions, indeed, into all teleological ascrip- tions. In addition, he (404) maintains that the imported goals are cho- sen by humans. We can grant to Schaffner that evolutionary biologists and others have chosen to ask questions about, for instance, the current patterns of distribution of biotic types as well as their temporal patterns of survival and extinction. These are effects for which causal expla- nations are sought. But measured in terms of survival and reproduc- tion, certain adaptations clearly are better than others for a given type of organism. Evidence for that abounds; indeed, without differences in fitness with respect to traits, there is no natural selection. Although, like many biologists and philosophers of biology, Schaffner wants to avoid adaptationism (that is, finding an evolutionary function for an organism's every trait), nevertheless, he does not deny that natural selection is one of several evolutionary forces. Consequently, I con- clude that Schaffner is incorrect in claiming that biologists merely choose, for instance, to say that the melanic coloring of moths in the polluted industrial areas of England is, in fact, a benefit for their pos- sessors, that it fulfills an end of its possessors. Rather, the biologists' conclusion is required by the evidence. Thus, generalizing, I maintain 710</page><page sequence="14">A CRITIQUE OF SCHAFFNER'S VIEWS that evolutionary theorists do not choose arbitrarily or solely for heu- ristic purposes to speak of benefits, things for the sake of which other things occur. They do so because reference to such benefits is part of their best explanation of the phenomena. On the other hand, evolutionary theorists make no claims about the ultimate value of survival, as opposed to non-survival, whether that be of an individual or of a group; nor about the ultimate value of differ- ential reproduction which leads in part to the continued or enhanced existence of certain types. But not all talk of values or goods must be about ultimate value nor, for that matter, about intrinsic (non- instrumental) values. Biologists identify instrumental goals and values for individual organisms and types on a regular basis, not because they arbitrarily choose to do so, but rather because these goals and values have descriptive and explanatory force. The beneficial adaptations that they identify are genuinely instrumental values for the organisms in question. They serve the organisms in achieving survival and repro- duction. Whether the latter are ultimate values or not, they are intrin- sically valuable for the organisms involved since they involve the organisms' very well-being and existence. Although medieval philoso- phers founded their claims about ends and intrinsic values on the prem- ise that all being is good, one need not hold such ambitious meta- physical principles about the presence of the good in the universe in order to make claims about values and goals concerning organisms in nature. In a more modest vein, biologists are on solid ground in claim- ing that a part of adaptational functional descriptions and explanations is an appeal to adaptations that are good for the organisms themselves and enable them to pursue and attain ends that are intrinsically valu- able for themselves. If so, then Schaffner's appeal to a version of the naturalistic fallacy in rejecting evolutionarily founded teleological as- criptions itself becomes suspect. Organisms are not only up to some- thing, but they are up to something good or bad for themselves. The fact that Schaffner restricts the ascription of genuine ends to human intentional behavior (and, perhaps, to some higher primates and yet to be built machine intelligences) leads one to suspect that he is also under the all too prevalent grip of anthropocentrism, the view that the only genuine ends and goods in nature are those pursued by humans. Those who hold such a view tend to make much of the fallacy of anthropomorphism. The fallacy of anthropomorphism is the fallacy of projecting properly human characteristics onto a nonhuman nature that does not possess them. End-seeking and seeking the good are com- monly thought to be such properly human characteristics. Proponents of the fallacy of anthropomorphism assume not only that humans do seek ends and goods, but that it is relatively clear on the basis of the 711</page><page sequence="15">WILLIAM A. ROTTSCHAEFER observation of human behavior how this occurs. However, this latter assumption is questionable. The role of goals and goods, as well as beliefs about them, in the bringing about of human goal-seeking is not resolved. Nor is it clear that human goal-seeking alone is the source for our understanding of goal-seeking behavior or of goods or benefits, even in the case of human goal-seeking. Teleological descriptions and explanations of human behavior may themselves depend in part upon the recognition of the successful consequence structure common to functional, goal-directed, and human teleological behavior. If this is so, Schaffner's position provides us with an understanding of not only how anthropocentricism can unduly narrow our view of the capacities of nonhuman living things but also how it can restrict (by charging that advocates of a naturalized teleology commit the fallacy of anthro- pomorphism) the range of our cognitive access to teleological phenom- ena.17 But despite these suspicions about the role of anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism in Schaffner's account, I do not want to press that point since it is clear that for Schaffner in the end there are no ends or goods. All talk of goals and benefits will be gone in the ideally com- pleted scientific framework (379-380, 410). Thus, ultimately, Schaffner rejects the charge against the naturalistic teleologist of committing the fallacy of anthropomorphism. But one can reject the fallacy of anthro- pomorphism in two ways, either by denying that any organisms, hu- mans included, have or seek ends (Schaffner's in-principle eliminabil- ity) or by denying that only humans have or seek ends. If I am right about the implications of adaptational functional ascriptions, both hu- man and nonhuman organisms have and pursue ends that are either good or bad for them. To this extent anthropocentrism and the fallacy of anthropomorphism become suspect. 7. In conclusion, then, I contend, contra Schaffner, that an etiological analysis of adaptational functional ascriptions shows that such anal- yses, in particular their goal clauses, are supported by selectional evo- lutionary explanations and provide examples of teleological descrip- tions and explanations in evolutionary biology. The processes of natural selection build organisms which have adaptations that have ends that are to their, and their descendants', benefit. REFERENCES Brandon, R. (1990), Adaptation and Environment.
