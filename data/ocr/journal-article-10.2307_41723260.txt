Brown Abstract In an effort to avoid the subjectivity of individual reason, Sunni Islam elaborated a method of hadïth criticism that subordinated evaluating the meaning of a report to an examination of its chain of transmission. With the fourth/ tenth-century episte- mologica! compromise of Ash(arism, however, Sunni hadïth scholars adopted rationalist criteria of content criticism that included explicit rules for rejecting hadïths because of their meaning. This resulted in a strong internal tension within Sunni hadïth criticism from the fifth/eleventh century onwards, with one and the same scholar upholding rigid rules of content criticism but not employing them or even rejecting them in application. The inherent subjectivity of content criticism resulted in different Muslim scholars either rejecting or affirming the same hadïths. Some scholars were much more inclined to reject a hadïth out of hand because of its meaning, while others were willing to extend a hadïth more interpretive charity. The tension created by the subjectivity of content criticism emerged in unprecedented relief in the modern period, when 'science' and modern social norms presented an unmatched challenge to the interpretive awe in which pre-modern (and Traditionalist scholars today) held attributions to the Prophet.

Among the reasons for which such third/ninth and fourth/ tenth-century Sun- nis dismissed hadïths we find historical anachronism, logical impossibil- ity and, most prominently, incompatibility with historical, legal and dogmatic received opinion.4 However, it is also obvious that these same hadlth critics often approved of hadlths that we might view as suffering from exactly these same flaws. Short of discovering manuscripts in which a scholar like al-Bukhârï demystifies his methods, we can never know why a scholar rejected anachronism in one hadlth while accept- ing it in another, why one scholar found a hadlth to be logically absurd 2) Voltaire, "Histoire," in Dictionnaire Philosophique (Paris: Boudouin Frères, 1829), 56:18. 3) See, for example, Ignaz Goldziher, Muslim Studies , trans.

This quandary places us squarely in front of the great challenge of content criticism: its inherent subjectivity. The valence of a text and whether its meaning clashes with some greater authority are decided by the reader. And readers all too often differ. It was precisely the pitfall of the subjectivity of reason that Sunni Islam was designed to avoid. One of the original hallmarks of the ahi al-hadïth! Sunni movement5 was the principle of subordinating reason to revealed text. Human reason, with its idiosyncrasies, whims, and mercurial understandings of the possible and impossible, cannot pro- vide a sound religious guide. True guidance comes from revelation alone. Sunni scholars never doubted the attribution of the Qur'an to its divine source, but individual hadlths were frequently not immedi- ately traceable to the Prophet. The Prophets true words might be divinely revealed guidance, but how could one evaluate whether a state- ment attributed to him was authentic or not? The Mu'tazill rationalist school proposed that putative hadlths be compared against the Qur'an and first principles of reason. Early Sunnis saw this as, once again, making human reason the judge over revelation. One person might think that a hadlth contradicts the Qur'an; another might feel it merely explains a non-obvious meaning in the holy book. One person might think that a hadlth has a logically impossible meaning; another might conclude that its meaning is figurative. Again, religion finds itself beholden to the subjective whims of reason.6 5) The synonymy of the term 'The People of the Sunna and the Collective {ahi al-sunna wa'l-jamâ'aY and the 'People of Hadlth {ahi al-hadïthY among those who identified themselves as such in the third/ninth century is, in my view, beyond dispute. See, for example, the Jämf of al-Tirmidhï (d. 279/892), where the author refers to the bilä kayf treatment of hadlths on Gods attributes as being the school of Mãlik, Ibn al-Mubärak and others, calling them the ' ahi al-sunna wa'1-jamã'a (I believe this is one of the earliest attested usages of this phrase) on one occasion and the ' ahi al-hadïth ' on another. At another point in the book, al-Tirmidhï quotes his teacher, al-Bukhârï, as saying that the party {tãHfáf that will always hold to the truth, as mentioned in hadïths, is the ahi al-hadïth (al-Bukhârï quotes his own teacher cAlï b. al-Madïnï as his source); ]ãmi al-Tirmidhï. kitãb al-zakãt , bãb mãjã'a fi fadl al-$adaqa' kitãb $ifat al-janna, bãb mã jâ'a fi khulüd ahi al-janna wa ahi al-nãr, kitãb al-fitan , bãb mâjâ'a fi al-a'imma al-mudillïn. 6) For an in-depth discussion of this subject, see Brown, "How We Know Early Hadïth Critics," 164 ff.</page><page sequence="4">J. A. C. Brown / Islamic Law and Society 19 (2012) 356-396 359 The early Sunnis proposed their system of transmission criticism as a way to exclude reason from the evaluation of a hadïths authenticity. Yet they nonetheless sensed the problematic meanings of some hadïths. On rare occasions they openly stated this. On all occasions, however, the cult of submission to the transmitted text was maintained. These scholars assumed that flawed matns were the result of some flaw in transmission and phrased their criticism in the language of transmission criticism. This upheld the image of an impersonal and objective system of criticism, but in fact the subtle machinations of subjectivity contin- ued to affect Sunni hadïth critics. In time, the role of content criticism received open recognition. Despite their triumph over Abbasid Mďtazilism in the mid-third/ninth century, Sunni scholars adopted much of Mu'tazill epistemology into Sunni theology and legal theory. Part of this acquired heritage was a list of criteria for identifying a forged hadïth based solely on its contents.7 This set of criteria has since been upheld by generations of Sunni hadïth scholars up to the present day. At the same time, however, and often by the same people, we find Sunni scholars reasserting the original Sunni rejection of content criti- cism in favor of submission to the cult of transmission. The inherent and inevitable subjectivity of content criticism appears clearly in Sunni critics' treatment of specific hadïths - where one jurist or commentator sees an absurd or sacrilegious attribution to the Prophet, another sees a piece of Prophetic wisdom that had perhaps simply been misunder- stood. Moreover, we see that certain hadïth scholars from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries CE were consistently more at ease with content criticism than others who favored interpretive charity and sub- mitting to transmitted text. Although the subjective tensions inherent in content criticism have appeared since the early Islamic period, they have manifested themselves with novel salience in the modern age. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many Muslim reformists found themselves con- fronted with the same quandary faced by European Christians in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Should the world and our scien- tific perception of it conform to scripture, or does something that claims 7) Brown, "How We Know Early Hadïth Critics," 150-3.</page><page sequence="5">360 J. A. C. Brown / Islamic Law and Society 19 (2012) 356-396 to be scripture need to conform to our understanding of the world? Is scripture and the narrative it presents "ontologically precedent" to his- tory and the external world?8 Many hadlths that were rejected by Mus- lim reformists like Rashïd Ridã (d. 1935) in the light of modern scientific discoveries or rational sensibilities had in fact been investi- gated on similar grounds in the pre-modern period. Whereas medieval Muslim 'ulama' had adopted figurative or charitable readings of these hadlths out of awe for Prophetic transmission,9 the heady winds of modernity led Muslim reformists to dismiss them roundly because of their content. Affirming the Rules for Content Criticism in Sunni Islam Since the fifth/eleventh century, Sunni scholarship on the methodology of hadlth evaluation has consistently and explicitly affirmed the role of content criticism as a method of evaluating a hadlths reliability with no reference to its isnãd . The notion that the contents of a hadlth alone can reveal its unreliability is rooted in opinions attributed to pioneering hadlth masters in works as early as that of Ibn Sa'd (d. 230/845). Such reports include the Successor Rabř b. Khuthaym (fi. 80/700) stating, "Indeed there are hadlths that have a light as bright as day that we know [to be authentic], and there are others possessed of a darkness that is rejected." This declaration was widely cited in discussions of hadïth critical methodology in the fifth/eleventh-century works of al-Hãkim al-Naysãburi (d. 405/1014) and al-Khatïb al-Baghdãdl (d. 463/ 1071). 10 8) Hans Frei, The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative: a Study in Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Hermeneutics (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974), 5. 9) Here I am consciously building on what Gershom Scholem called "the awe of the text," which, he explains, is "founded on the assumption that everything already exists in it, and the presumptuousness of imposing the truth upon ancient texts"; Gershom Scholem, The Messianic Idea in Judaism (New York: Schocken Books, 1971), 290.

Abi Tälib also gained currency in this period: "Indeed the truth is not known by men/transmitters. Rather, know the truth and you will know its men/ transmitters." 11 This maxim was immortalized by Abü Hamid al-Ghazâlï (d. 505/1 1 1 1) in his Ihyď (ulüm al-dìn , in which he used it to argue that a science should not be judged by the failures of some of its practitioners.12 This saying has been repeated in hadïth writings up to the present day, with some incorrectly attributing it to the Prophet.13 Most recently, the Moroccan hadlth scholar Ahmad al-Ghumãrí (d. 1960) phrased it as a final con- clusion of his work on forged hadlths: "Look at what is said, do not look at who said it ( unzur ilã al-maqãl wa lã tanzur ilã man qãl)"XA The legitimacy and methodological prominence of content criticism, however, became most clearly enshrined in Sunni works on the meth- ods, practice and technical terms of hadlth study (mustalahãt al-hadïth) . In the fifth/eleventh century, Sunni hadïth scholars imported from Mu'tazill epistemology a set of criteria by which the contents of a hadïth could be used to determine its authenticity.15 Amongst Sunnis, the taxonomy of these telltale content features originates in the work of al-Khatïb al-Baghdãdl, who listed them in his monumental treatise on the hadïth sciences, al-Kifãya fi (ilm al-riwãya . al-Khatïb al-Baghdãdl, al-Kifãya fi ma' rif at usül Him al-riwãya , ed.

These consist of reports that either: 1) reason (al-uqül) rejects as impossible, such as the notion that there is no Creator; 2) contradict the Qur'an, the massively transmitted Sunna of the Prophet {al-sunna al-mutawãtira ) or the consensus of the Muslim community; 3) are transmitted by limited narrations but address a topic so important for Muslims that, if the hadïth were truly the Prophet s words, it would have been much more widely transmitted; 4) Or recount events so momentous that if the report were true it would have been more widely transmitted.16 The list of culpatory contents registered by al-Khatïb influenced almost every significant Sunni scholar writing on hadïth criticism after him. It formed the basis for later discussions of content criticism. In his famous Muqaddima , Ibn al-Salãh (d. 643/1245) adds a summary of al-Khatlb s list that encompasses form as well as content: clear signs of forgery include feeble or preposterous wording or meaning ( rakãkat alfãzihã wa mcCànïha)}1 A separate stream of empirically-based content criticism was introduced by 'Umar b. Badr al-Mawsilï (d. 622/1225) and al-Hasan al-Saghãnl (d. 650/1252), an Indian hadïth scholar who traveled to Baghdad and eventually returned to his homeland as the Abbasid emissary to the Delhi Sultanate. Al-Mawsilï compiled a book entitled al-Mughni (an al-hijz wal-kitãb fi-mã lamyasihha shay' fi al-bãb (, Sufficing one from Memorization and Books on Issues on which there are No Reliable Hadïths ). In his collection of forged hadïths, al-Saghânï lists topics on which one only finds forged hadïths.18 This notion was further developed by Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (d. 750/1351), who provided a more comprehensive list of categories of forged hadïths, such as hadïths ,6) Al-Khatïb al-Baghdàdï, al-Kifãya fi ma' rif at u$ül Him al-riwãya , 1:89; idem, al-Faqih wa'l-mutafaqqih , ed.

Such intangible expertise "comes from long hours of study ( tül al-mujãlasa ), discussion, and experience," explained the critic Ibn 'Adi (d. 365/975-6). 24 In his writings on hadïth methodology in the seventh/thirteenth century, the Egyptian Ibn Daqïq al-îd (d. 702/1302) introduces the notion of an experiential faculty {haf a naf- sãniyya aw malaka) - a nose' - that one acquires through long exposure to Prophetic hadïths and that allows one to know what can and what cannot be the Prophet s speech, based on both form and content.25 This theme has also been echoed by subsequent generations of scholars.26 Interestingly, this notion of an experiential faculty developed most comprehensively in the twentieth century. The Salafl scholar of Damas- cus, Jamal al-Dïn al-Qâsimï, links this intuitive taste for true Prophetic speech to a scholar s highly developed piety.27 He builds this partially on Ibn Taymiyyas (d. 728/1328) argument that, in the absence of strong legal evidence, the moral intuition of a scholar whose "heart is edified by the fear of God ( taqwã )" can be accepted as proof in deter- mining the legal status of an action.28 Al-Qâsimï also cites at length the writings of Ibn 'Urwa al-Hanbalï (d. 837/1433-4) and the early Sufi Shãh al-Kirmânï (d. ca. 300/900), who argued that pious and god- fearing believers possess an intuitive ability to discern truth from false- hood, authentic hadïths from spurious ones, citing as evidence hadïths such as, "Beware the perspicacity of the believer, for he sees with the light of God ( ittaqü firãsat al-mumin fa-innahu yanzuru bi-nür Allãh) Shãh al-Kirmânï even recounts how he witnessed a pious Muslim reject a hadïth as a forgery merely by hearing it. Later, al-Kirmânï researched the hadïth and found that the pious man was right.29 24) Ibn cAdï, al-Kãmil , 1:118. This comparison is attributed to cAbd al-Rahmãn b.

In the conclusion of his list of the forged hadïths that he determines al-Suyütí to have erroneously included in his al-Jámť al-saghïr, al-Ghumârï describes how forged hadïths are obvious immediately to master critics. These are the virtuosos who have practiced "until they have tasted the flavor of the Prophetic utterances, and their heart and mystery has mixed with his flesh and blood so that his soul accepts authentic hadïths and the Pro- phetic word, inclining to it upon merely hearing it," and conversely with forgeries. This is only possible for those whose "souls are blended with the Sunna, with the light of the heart and purity of mind (. safã ' al-dhihn )." Al-Ghumârï extends this ability to those elite Sufis who are the "gnostics, those possessed of sound unveiling {ahi al-kashf al-sahih) and piercing perception by the light of God."31 lhe Converse: Sunni Rejection of Content Criticism in Theory and Practice Al-Khatïb al-Baghdâdï represents well the paradox of content criticism in Sunni hadïth scholarship. Although he provided the basis for all later rules of content criticism, at no point in his many works on hadïth criticism (such as the Kifãya or the JãmV li-akhlãq al-rãtvi wa ãdãb al-sãmi *) does he ever actually employ it explicitly. In the case of the dozens of hadïths that he criticizes as forged ( mawdü ) or unacceptable {munkar) in his Tãrikh Baghdãd , not once does the author cite the contents of a hadïth as the reason for his verdict.32 He may indeed have 'Urwa's (a.k.a. Ibn Zaknün) unpublished al-Kawãkib al-darãri fi tartïb Musnad al-imãm Ahmad calã abwãb al-Bukhãri. 30) For debates over the concept of reformist, 'Neo-Sufism', see R.S.

As I discussed in an earlier article, the methodological vision of the early Sunnis was built on the cult of the isnãd and on the subordination of reason to transmission criticism. As the Sunni Ibn Qutayba (d. 276/889) asserted in his rebut- tal of the Mu'tazilïs: We do not resort except to that to which the Messenger of God (s) resorted. And we do not reject what has been transmitted authentically from him because it does not accord with our conjectures (awhãminã) or seem correct to reason ... we hope that in this lies the path to salvation and escape from the baseless whims of heresy (ahwã1).05 (my emphasis) The contents of a hadïth might be problematic, but, for the early Sun- nis, deeming it a forgery had to be couched in terms of flaws in trans- mission. Ibn Qutayba points out the dangers that the early Sunnis saw in open and unrestricted content criticism. Consider, for example, Muctazilï criticisms of the infamous Hadïth of the Fly, which states that, if a fly lands in ones drink, one should submerge it fully and then remove it, since if there is disease on one wing the cure is on the other.34 Ibn Qutaybas rationalist opponents deemed it absurd that the same fly could carry both a disease and its cure. Ibn Qutayba counters that a Muslim who refuses to follow hadïths because of rational objections and accepts religious texts based solely on the suitability of their con- tents "is rejecting what the Prophet and the Companions left us."35 Listing a set of rules for unacceptable contents was thus very un- Sunni. It is no surprise that this list was imported from Mu'tazilism by Ash'aris like al-Khatïb as part of the Ashcarï epistemological compro- mise.36 In the centuries after al-Khatïb, leading Sunni hadïth scholars mirrored his paradoxical approach to content criticism. The prolific 33) Abù Muhammad 'Abdallah Ibn Qutayba al-Dïnawarï, Ta'wïl mukhtalif al- hadïth, ed.

One piece of evidence marshaled by al-Suyûtï in his salvation argument is a hadïth stating that the Prophet s mother was actually brought back to life briefly in order to embrace his message. A whole cadre of Sunni scholars, however, had objected to this hadïth on the grounds that its meaning was untenable. The Andalusian peripatetic hadïth scholar Ibn Dihya (d. 633/1235) lambastes the hadïth for break- ing with the consensus that the Prophets mother had never been revived and for contradicting numerous Qur'anic verses. These include the Qur'anic injunction, "Do not ask about the people of Hellfire (wa lã tas3 al ' an ashãb al-jahim )," which, according to Ibn Dihya, was revealed to the Prophet after he had exclaimed that he hoped his parents had found bliss in the afterlife, and verses stating that those who disbelieve can find no comfort in their good deeds on the Day of Resurrection. Finally, Ibn Dihya argues, it is absurd to think that someone can be credited for believing in the message of Islam if he has been revived from the dead to do so! This is analogous to the Qur'ans common-sense statement that unbelievers' regrets on the Day of Judgment will avail them nothing.38 Al-Suyûtï responds with a scathing attack on Ibn Dihyas methodol- ogy: "Ibn Dihyas finding fault (ta'lil) in the hadïth for contradicting the evident meaning of the Qur'an does not accord with the method of the scholars of hadïth." He quotes the fifth/eleventh-century hadïth scholar Abû al-Fadl al-Maqdisïs (d. 507/1 113) rebuke of Ibn Hazm (d. 456/1064) for his criticism of a hadïth found in Sahih al-Bukhârï 39 on the grounds that it contradicted several accepted hadïths: 37) Al-Suyuçï, Tadrïb al-rãwi, 213. 38) Al-Suyùçï, "al-Taczïm wal-minna fï anna abaway Rasul Allah (s) fi al-janna," in Silsilat matbü'ät DäHrat al-Ma'ärifal-Uthmäniyya 50 (1915-6): 7-8. For a modern discussion of how one s belief in God and Islam must be made freely and before the coming of God s manifest judgment, see Yusuf al-Qara4ãwI, al-Hurriyya al-dïniyya wal-ta 'addudiyya fi nazar al-Islãm (Beirut: al-Maktab al-Islãml, 1428/2007), 22. 39) This hadïth is narrated by Sharlk b. 'Abdallah and describes the Prophet s night journey to Jerusalem as occurring "before his revelation (qabla an yühä ilayhi )." This, of course,</page><page sequence="14">J. A. C. Brown / Islamic Law and Society 19 (2012) 356-396 369 Indeed Ibn Hazm, although he was a master in diverse sciences, did not follow the method of the hadlth masters in his criticism of that hadlth. And that is because the hadïth masters criticize a hadïth by means of its isnãd , which is the means of approaching it ( mirqãt ilayhi ), while that man [Ibn Hazm] criticized it for its text (lafz).40 Tension between Subjective Reason and Submission to Claims of Revelation within the Hadlth Corpus The tension between submission to the omniscience of divine revelation and contesting such attributions on grounds of natural reason is found in foundational texts of the Sunni hadlth corpus itself. Later Muslim scholars invoked these reports to argue for or against admitting specific hadïths as evidence in their arguments. We will not consider here whether these competing reports can be traced back to the time of the Prophet. Instead will we only take into consideration their use in the period after the mainstay hadlth collections in which they first appear. These reports and the manner in which scholars used them demonstrate that the inherent tension and subjectivity of content criticism was embedded in Sunni scholarly discourse from its earliest days. Consider the following two reports. The first is a well-known Pro- phetic hadlth that we will refer to as the Hadlth of Cringing. Dating from at least the early third/ninth century (respected Sunni scholars considered it reliable), it is narrated by the Successor cAbd al-Malik b. Said from Abù Hamid and Abù Usayd and states that the Prophet said: would seem to contradict blatantly the consensus that the Isrã} and Mťráj occurred during the Prophet's preaching in Mecca. For Ibn Hazm's criticism, see cAlï b. Muhammad Ibn Hazm, [Two Hadïths from the Sahihayn - One from al-Bukhârï and One from Muslim - that Ibn Hazm Considers Forgeries]," MS Ahmet III 624, Topkapi Sarayi Library, Istanbul: 29a. Ibn Hajar rejects this criticism. He suggests numerous interpretations for the hadïth, including the notion that "before the revelation" meant before a particular instance of revelation. In other words, the Prophet was transported on the Isrã' without being warned by the means of revelation. See Ibn Hajar, Fath al-bãri sharh Sahïh al-Bukhãri, ed. cAbd al-cAzïz b. 'Abdallah b.

It is attrib- uted to both (All b. Abï Tãlib and Ibn Mas'ûd and states, "If you are told a hadïth from the Prophet, think of it what is most fitting, most pious and best guided."42 We will refer to this as the Command to Charity. These two reports appear to be at loggerheads. The Hadïth of Cring- ing clearly instructs Muslims to evaluate claims about the Prophet mak- ing a statement on the basis of their own subjective understanding of right and wrong, appropriate and inappropriate. The Command to Charity, however, tells Muslims to subordinate their natural reaction and moral judgment to an assumption of charity - if one understands a report attributed to the Prophet negatively, then one must find a bet- ter and alternative interpretation more befitting Islamic teachings. One might assume that the Command to Charity addresses how Muslims should interpret hadïths that have already been authenticated , and this is certainly how one of the scholars discussed below understood it. But, as we will also see below, this is explicitly not the case for most scholars examined. Sunni scholars affirmed the evident meanings and messages of these two edicts. The early Hanafi jurist of Egypt Abu Ja'far al-Tahâwï (d. 321/932) ruminates on the Hadlth of Cringing and concludes that it confirms that the Prophet s teachings, like God s words in the Qur'an, accord with man s natural perception of right and wrong.43 In the intro- ductory chapters of his dictionary of impugned transmitters, the Kãmil fi du(afď al-rijãl , the Shâfi'ï hadïth scholar Ibn cAdl cites a version of the Cringing Hadïth as the basis for his chapter on Tearing the hadïths 42) "Idhã huddithtum bi-hadïth min al-Nabï fa-zannü bihi mã huiva ahya ; wa mã huwa atqã wa mã huwa ahdã."

They did not overtly connect the hadlth to the danger that Sunni Muslims had been trumpeting since the birth of the movement, namely that it was precisely an overconfidence in man s frail reason to decide matters of religion and religious law that had led countless communities astray in the past. Not surprisingly, the reliance on subjective reason inherent in the Hadlth of Cringing was a double-edged sword. In the enduring debate over the acceptability of music in Islam, we see the Cringing Hadïth brought into direct competition with the transmission-based system of authentication that Sunnis hoped would remove reason from the pro- cess of hadïth criticism.47 The Alexandrian scholar Ahmad Ibn al-Muza- yyan al-Qurtubï (d. 656/1258) employs the Cringing Hadïth to argue for the inherent truthfulness of hadïths condemning music in the face of serious criticisms of the isnäd reliability of these reports.

Al-Qurtubï retorts, however, that these flawed hadïths are buttressed by general Islamic "legal principles (al-qawäcid al-shar'iyya )," as the hadïths accord with the values of the Shariah and instruct Muslims not to engage in foolish and vain activities. He then cites the Hadïth of Cringing as evidence that Muslims know a sound hadïth when they hear it. Al-Qurtubï quotes an earlier Andalusian scholar who also drew on this hadïth to hammer home his argument: "As cAbd al-Haqq [Ibn al-Kharrãt al-Ishbïlï] (d. 581/1185) said, 'What these hadïths include in terms of condemning singing and singers, the hearts of the scholars accept it and their minds and bodies are at ease with it. . .."48 In his commentary on al-Ghazâlïs Ihyã} f ulüm al-dïn , Murtadä al-Zabïdï (d. 1791 CE) dives into the debate, arguing against those who prohibit music by pointing to the many isnäd flaws of the anti-music hadïths. The inevitable subjectivity of content criticism actually affords al-Zabïdï an opening to rebut al-Qurtubïs argument. Turning the Hadïth of Cringing against his opponent, al-Zabïdï argues that the extent to which music promotes "softening of the heart, the souls long- ing for those beloved people and places, benefit for the body and bring- ing joy to the heart" means that one could just as easily use one s moral sense to reject hadïths banning music.49 All the Sunni scholars examined in this research have been uniform in their interpretation of the Command to Charity, which they have understood as embodying an important hermeneutic principle. The famous Shâflcï scholar of Naysäbür, Ibn Khuzayma (d. 31 1/923), who acted as the pivot for the transmission and dispersion of al-Shâfi'ïs teachings in Khurasan, invokes this saying of £Alï in his vehemently traditionist theological treatise the Kitãb al-Tawhïd. The author notes that this saying articulates an important rule that should govern schol- ars' interpretations of Prophetic reports: it is essential to read hadïths 48) Ahmad b.

If a scholar proceeded otherwise, he might understand one hadïth as contradicting or invalidating another. For example, Ibn Khuzayma explains, a Prophetic report stating that a Muslim who commits a cer- tain sin will not enter heaven should not be understood as an absolute statement (since Sunni orthodoxy holds that all monotheists, and all Muslims, will one day enter Heaven). Rather, it should be understood as meaning that this person will not enter heaven as easily as someone who has committed that sin.50 Although he adhered to the rival Hanafl school of law and legal theory, Ibn Khuzaymas contemporary in Naysâbûr, Abu Bakr al-Jassäs (d. 370/981), also invoked the Command to Charity. In a discussion of hadïths stating that children born of fornication cannot enter Heaven, he emphasizes that, if deemed authentic, such hadïths should not be interpreted literally.51 In this case they would contradict the Qur'anic principle that 'No bearer of burdens can bear the burdens of another {lã taziru wãzira wizra ukhra) (Qur'än 6:164). Instead, these hadïths must have been addressed at specific individuals only. "All this proves," concludes al-Jassãs, "that the ruling of a report that seems to contradict the ruling of the Qur'an or established Sunna {al-sunna al-thãbita) should be interpreted in a correct way if possible and not used in a way that contradicts those two sources."52 Are Muslims supposed to reject hadïths that seem unacceptable or unbefitting the teachings of the Prophet?

Although no Muslim scholar that I know of has addressed the dichotomous ten- sion between the Hadïth of Cringing and the Command to Charity, several have dealt with it implicitly by using the two maxims to check one another. Our earliest attestation for the Command to Charity comes from the Surtan of 'Abdallah b. cAbd al-Rahmãn al-Dârimï (d. 255/869), a major ahlal-hadïth scholar of the Khurasan region. In the introductory chapters of his Sunan , which constitute a veritable manifesto of ahi al-hadïth methodology, one subchapter deals with "Interpreting the Reports of the Messenger of God ( ta'wïl hadïth rasül Alláh )". Two of the four reports in this subchapter consist of the Command to Charity, the first attributed to Ibn Mas'ûd and the second to 'All. Interestingly, the third report features Ibn 'Abbas warning his audience, presumably his students, "If you hear me narrate something from the Messenger of God (s) but do not find it in the Book of God or accepted among the people ( hasarf" lind al-nãs), then know that I have ascribed something falsely to him ( kadhabtu (alayhi)Pò Although not the Hadïth of Cring- ing per se , Ibn 'Abbas' words convey the same message: if the meaning of the putative hadïth does not seem correct to your sensibilities as Muslims, the narrator must be incorrectly representing the Prophet. Reading al-Dârimï s chapter, one comes away with a dynamic tension rather than a clear rule: interpret a hadïth attributed to the Prophet in the most charitable way possible, but if it contradicts how the Muslim community understands Islam then it must not really be from Muhammad. How exactly the 'Muslim community' understands Islam' is, of course, a matter of considerable debate. The Hadïth of Cringing and the Command to Charity appear together on later occasions as well. Immediately after invoking the Hadïth of Cringing in his Tafiïr to underscore the unfailing righteous- ness of the Prophet s guidance, Ibn Kathïr brings to bear 'Alï's Com- mand to Charity without any intervening comment or explanation. I can only interpret this as Ibn Kathïr s cautioning the reader that the consistent truth of Muhammad's words means that we must be humble before judging them.

After listing a number of variations of the Hadïth of Cringing, he adds, "Whatever [Prophetic] reports have proven reliable (. sahha ) must be interpreted in the best and most fitting way {'alã ahsan al-wujüh wa awlãhà )" (my emphasis). He then he cites 'Alls Command to Charity.54 Two Extremes on Content Criticism: Shams al-Dïn al-Dhahabï and Mullã 'Ali al-Qarť The inevitable subjectivity of content criticism surfaces in the manner in which different scholars approached hadïth criticism. Some hadïth critics were consistently more likely to reject hadïths based on content, while others steered sharply away from content criticism in favor of charitable interpretation. We have already seen Ibn Hazm singling out a hadïth from the revered Sahïh of al-Bukhârï for content criticism, while the great Iraqi hadïth scholar al-Dâraqutnï (d. 385/995) criticized 217 hadïths in al-Bukhârï s and Muslims collections for isnãd reasons without ever mentioning an objection to content.55 Two noted scholars afford a useful comparison in attitude towards content criticism: the Damascene hadïth scholar Shams al-Dïn al-Dhahabï (d. 748/1348) and the resident Hanafï master of Mecca, Mullã (Alï al-Qãri' (d. 1014/ 1606). The first was a Shâfi'ï with strong Salafï leanings who produced definitive biographical dictionaries and hadïth works, the second was a staunch Hanafï and Ash'arï56 known for his encyclopedic commentar- ies on numerous mainstay hadïth texts. Al-Dhahabï engages in content criticism with remarkable frequency in his Mizãn al-i(tidãl fi naqd al-rijãl , a compendium of impugned hadïth transmitters. His criticism of individual hadïths comes as he lists reports that he feels indict a problematic hadïth narrator or forger. 54) Ibn Muflih, al-Âdãb al-shar'iyya , 2:287-95. 55) See Jonathan Brown, "Criticism of the Proto-Hadïth Canon: al-Dâraqutnï s Adjustment of the $ahihayn" Journal of Islamic Studies 15, no. 1 (2004): 1-37. 56) I do not know if we have a record of Mullã (AlI explicitly professing Ash'arism, but his theological positions are in line with those of the school.

Brown / Islamic Law and Society 19 (2012) 356-396 òli Al-Dhahabï rejects some hadïths based on their illogical or unreasonable content. For example, he criticizes a hadïth in which the Prophet is quoted as saying that guarding the coast for one night is better than the good deeds of 1,000 years, each day of which was the equivalent of 1 ,000 normal years. Al-Dhahabï objects to this report because it would lead to an outrageously large reward in the Afterlife. Based on his rough calculation, this act would be the equivalent of doing good deeds con- stantly for 360,000,000 days.57 Evaluating a hadlth describing how the Byzantine emperor supposedly sent the Prophet a gift of ginger C zanjabïl ), al-Dhahabï objects that this was implausible for two reasons. First, there is no record of the Byzantine emperor sending the Prophet any presents and, second, it would be like sending coal to Newcastle: "A present of ginger from Anatolia to the Hijaz is something that reason rejects, for it is similar to sending a gift of dates from Anatolia to Medina."58 Al-Dhahabï frequently jettisons hadïths due to anachronism. He rejects a hadïth in which the Prophet recounts how "Gabriel came to me with a dish of fruit from Heaven, so I ate it. Then I slept with Khadïja and [she became pregnant with] Fatima... (jâ'anï Jibrâ'ïl bi - safrajalla min al-janna fa-akaltuhã fa-wäqa'tu Khadïja fa-allaqat bi-Fãtima...). Al-Dhahabï snarls, "Even children have learned that Gabriel did not descend on the Prophet until some time after the birth of Fatima."59 Al-Dhahabï also criticizes a hadïth narrated by Abù Mùsâ al-Ash'arï on the Prophet s teenage trips to Syria with his uncle Abu Tãlib. "What shows that this [version] is false is the part that say s, And Abu Tãlib sent him back, and Abu Bakr sent Bilãl with him', because Bilãl had not even been born yet, and Abù Bakr was but a youth."60 Al-Dhahabï also rejects a hadïth that "[t]he Prophet set as places to 57) Al-Dhahabï, Mizän , 2:132 (bio of Sacïd b.

This report must be a forgery because Basra did not exist at the time of the Prophet, notes al-Dhahabï, "rather it was established as a garrison city in the time of cUmar."61 A notion of physical impossibility also constituted part of al-Dhahabï s critical toolkit. He notes a hadïth recorded by Ibn (Adl from Ibn cUmar in his Kämil , that "the Prophet came out of his house one day and had in his hand two books with the names of the People of Heaven and the People of Hell [written in them], identifying each by their names, the names of their fathers and their tribes ( kharaja rasül Allãh (s) dhãt yawm . . .)."62 Al-Dhahabï objects, "That is a totally unacceptable hadïth (; munkar jidet "), and it would be enough to determine that the weight of the two books would be tremendous."63 The above examples of content criticism occur within the context of transmitter criticism in al-Dhahabïs compendium of impugned trans- mitters. As such, one might argue that al-Dhahabï may have considered uncovering flaws in the meaning of these hadïths only because he was already convinced of the unreliability of those who transmitted them. Certainly, the authors discussion of these problematic mains in his Mizãn is intended as an indictment of their transmitters. But not all the hadïths transmitted by these narrators were considered unreliable.64 Five of the above six transmitters in whose biographies al-Dhahabï notes 6,) Ibid., 4:313 (bio of Hilãl b. Zayd).

Moreover, two of the hadïths mentioned above by al-Dhahabï are themselves included in those canonical works. Al-Dhahabï thus chose to include his criticisms of the above hadïths first and foremost because their meanings struck him as objectionable. Furthermore, al-Dhahabï engages in content criticism in hadïths whose isnãds he admits have no weaknesses. He remarks that a hadïth in which the Prophet is described as saying the basmala out loud in prayer was forged "even though its isnãd is like the sun."65 Here, al-Dhahabï s reader would recognize the great controversy to which he refers: the Shâfi'ï schools stubborn insistence on reciting the basmala aloud in prayer despite the strong hadïths stating that the Prophet never did this as well as the clear falsity of hadïths supporting the Shâfi'ï position.66 Al-Dhahabï also states that another hadïth perennially crit- icized for its flawed meaning, in which the newly converted Abù Sufyãn asks the Prophet to marry his daughter Umm Habïba, was "an unac- ceptable tradition (asl munkar )" even though this hadïth appeared in the revered Sahïh of Muslim (as other critics had pointed out, the Prophet had married Umm Habïba earlier, upon her return from Ethiopia).67 Although not a Prophetic hadïth, al-Dhahabï reacts with similar disbelief to a report of Ibn Hanbal grudgingly acknowledging the truth of Sufism as practiced by his rival al-Hãrith al-Muhâsibï: "This story has an authentic isnâd but is unacceptable ( munkara ). It does not sit easily with my heart {lã taqa'u (alã qalbi ), and I considered it highly unlikely that this would take place with someone like Ahmad."68 65) Al-Dhahabï, Mïzân , 1:480; see also ibid., 2:612-3. 66) Al-Dhahabï notes that al-Khatïb al-Baghdàdï included this hadïth in his treatise written in support of the the Shâfi'ï position on the basmala. Previously, Ibn al-Jawzi had lambasted al-Khatïb for this work (his Kitãb al-Jahr bil-basmala), which used unreliable hadïths to argue the Shâfi'ï position.

Addressing a controversial hadïth affirming that anything someone says after he sneezes is true, Mullã cAlï dismisses critics like Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, who had declared the hadlth forged in part due to its absurd meaning, by asserting: "It is not hidden at all that if something has been established by transmission [from the Pro- phet], then one should not heed ( lã Hbra) any contradiction with sense perception or reason."69 Instead of questioning the reliability of a hadlth on the grounds of reason, one should accept a viable isnãd and rely on charitable interpretation.

Dreams have no necessary link to reality and are merely representational. He concludes: For indeed if the [evaluation of the] hadïth is based on something in its isnãd that demonstrates its being a forgery, then we concede the point [that it is forged]. But if not, then the realm of possible interpretation is definitely wide (fa-bãb al-ta'wïl wãsV muhattam) ."71 Mullã cAlï contests the conclusion of Ibn Hajar and others that there is no basis for the hadïth: "The foolish rabble of Mecca are the filling of Heaven {sufahã* Mak ka hashw al-janna)."

He relies on content criticism in his condemnation of the following hadïth: "Strangers [or Sufis] are the heirs of the prophets, for God did not send a prophet except that he was a stranger amongst his people {al-ghurabã* warathat al-anbiyã' wa lam yab'ath Allãh nabiyýn illã wa huwagharïb fi qawmihi . . .)."

An example comes from our earliest surviving compilation of forged hadlths, the Tadhki- rat al-mawdü'ät of Abù al-Fadl Muhammad b. Tãhir al-MaqdisI (d. 507/1 113). This book lists 1,119 hadlths that the author deems forger- ies, and in the case of all but one hadïth the author declares his subject matter forgeries based on some problematic transmitter in the isnàd . Only once does al-Maqdisï base his ruling on content criticism. This is the report in which the Prophet says: "The parable of my community is that of the rain. It is not known which is better, its beginning or its end ( mathalu ummatï mathal al-matar lã yudrã awwaluhu khayr aw ãkhiruhu )." Although al-Maqdisï presents the technical proof for this hadlth being a forgery as the presence of the problematic transmitter Hishãm b. 'Ubaydallâh al-Râzï in the isnàd, he adds a sharp criticism about its contents: "It has been transmitted authentically that [the Prophet] said, 'The best generation is my generation, then the one that follows me {khayr al-qurün qarnï thumma alladhï yalünahum) ."76 Indeed, unlike the plethora of other hadïths describing the historical entropy of Muslim society as it deteriorates from the time of the Prophet, the Parable of the Rain Hadïth suggests that later generations of Muslims will perhaps be more righteous than earlier ones. This hadlth, however, has been widely considered to be perfectly reliable and without any objectionable content. Ibn Hibbãn (d. 354/ 965) included it in his Sahih , al-Tirmidhï included it in his Jãmi' and Ibn 'Abd al-Barr (d. 463/1070) and al-Suyûtï considered it hasan77 76) Abu al-Fadl Muhammad b.

In the introduction to his biographical dictionary of famous Sufis, al-Sulamï (d. 412/1021) saw the Parable of the Rain hadïth as complementing perfectly reports asserting that the greatest generation was that of the Companions. He understood that, taken together, these two hadïths mean that neither the early Muslims nor the later generations of the community would be bereft of pious figures.78 Later biographical dictionaries, like the Kawãkib al-s d'ira bi-a(yãn al-mťa al- ãs h ira of Najm al-Dïn al-Ghazzí (d. 1061/1651), cite the Parable of the Rain hadïth precisely for the purpose of assuring the presence of worthy Muslims in later genera- tions.79 The hadïth chosen by al-Jassâs as an example of a report with a meaning ripe for problematic interpretation affords another excellent example: "The child born of adultery will not enter Heaven ( lãyadkhulu al-janna walad al-zinã )." Abù al-Khayr Ahmad al-Tâliqânï (d. 590/ 1194) recounts that in 576/1180 an energetic discussion about this hadïth broke out among students at the Baghdad Nizãmiyya. One party insisted that the hadïth was forged because it violated the Qur'ânic principle that "no bearer of burdens bears the burdens of another" (Qur'an 6:164), while al-Tâliqânï argued that, unlike other Muslims who die as children, this child of adultery would not join its Muslim parents in heaven because its paternity was uncertain.80 In his famous Kitäb al-Mawdü'ät , Ibn al-Jawzï (d. 597/1201) asserts that none of the narrations of this hadïth are authentic and reaffirms that it violates that venerable Qur'ânic principle.81 Ibn al-Qayyim, Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalânï, 78) Abu cAbd al-Rahmãn al-Sulamï, Tabaqãt al-süfiyya , ed.

Ibn Hajar and his student al-Sakhâwï suggested that this hadïth assumes that the child would commit the same sin as its parents. Continuity and Intensification in the Modern Period Content criticism burgeoned with the Muslim confrontation with Western modernity and science. Influential reformist scholars like Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan (d. 1898) in India and Muhammad 'Abduh (d. 1905) in Egypt sought to recast Islam as a religion compatible with rationalism. They did whatever possible to distance it from superstition and Ptolemean cosmology. These Muslim reformists found themselves treading a thin line. Khan, cAbduh and their followers were devout Muslims committed to affirming the overall value of the Islamic scholarly tradition. Yet they also critiqued what they saw as its excesses and deviations, arguing that the religions true message was compatible with and representative of the best of the modern world. If the Sunni hadïth tradition had authen- ticated seemingly absurd reports like the Hadïth of the Fly, how could the corpus of hadïth be defended in a modern context? How deeply were the reformists willing to critique the hadïth tradition, and how could they justify revamping it? Material like the Hadïth of the Fly called into question whether classical Sunni hadïth scholars had actually carried out content criticism at all. Some modern Muslim thinkers have insisted that their premodern forbearers rigorously carried out content criticism. One of Khans more conservative disciples, the Indian writer Shibli Numani (d. 1916), explains in the introduction to his modern rendition of the Sïra that 82) Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Manãr al-munïf 133; Mullã 'Ali, al-Asrãr al-marfìi(a, 362, 370-71; al-Sakhâwï, al-Maqãsid al-hasana, 476; Muhammad Tãhir al-Fatani, Tadhkirat al-mawdü'ät, 180.</page><page sequence="30">J.

He then cites the well-worn lists of content criticism criteria found in the works of al-Khatïb and Ibn al-Jawzï.83 More recently, Yùsuf al-Qaradâwï has concurred.84 Other reformists following in cAbduhs footsteps, such as the Egyptian intellectual Jamãl al-Bannã (brother of Hasan al-Bannã), believe that early hadïth critics totally failed to examine the matn and see this failure as a prime argument for the general unreliability of the hadïth corpus as it is today.85 Other modern ( ulama5 have tried to reconcile Sunnis stated meth- odological commitment to content criticism with their evidently in- consistent application. Ahmad Khan argued that the Islamic hadïth tradition had in general cultivated a heritage of matn criticism, point- ing to the omnipresent list of content criteria discussed above. But he admitted that the great Sunni hadïth collectors of the third/ninth cen- tury had not actually engaged in content criticism while compiling their works. He opined that they had left this for later generations - thus explaining any absurd material found in their books and excusing its revaluation.86 The Egyptian Azharï reformist Muhammad al-Ghazzâlï (d. 1 996) states proudly in his influential work al-Sunna al-nabaiviyya bayn ahi al-fiqh wa ahi al-hadïth that two of the five conditions for a hadïth to be declared sahïh involve vetting its meaning (namely, the absence of hidden transmission flaws Y ilia] and of an anomalous mean- ing [. shudhüdh ]).87 In a later work, al-Ghazzâlï reiterates the standard 83) Shibli Numani, Sirat-un-Nabi , trans.

The requirement for $ihha has been considered almost uniformly from the time of Ibn al-Salãh to be: a hadith with an isnãd of upstanding ( WZ), accurate (dãbit) narrators one from another with no breaks, hidden flaws ('ilia) or anomalousness' {shudhüdh). From the fifth/eleventh century onwards, a shãdhdh hadith has been understood as meaning a hadith that contradicts a source more reliable than it. Hie potential for a shãdhdh quali- fication to open the door to matn criticism is clear: a faulty meaning would entail that the hadith is contradicting some more powerful normative source, like the Qur'än or reason, thus rendering the hadith çhãdhdh and precluding a sahih rating. The majority opinion of late medieval and modern Muslim hadith scholars, however, has also been that the term $ahih applies only to the isnãd of a hadith, and thus that 'the authenticity of a hadith does not necessarily follow from the authenticity of its isnãd (sihhat al-isnãd lã yalzamu minhã Sihhat al-hadïth) ,' since its matn might be flawed or contradict more reliable sources; 'Umar b. Muhammad al-Bayqùnï and 'Abdallah Sirãj al-Din, Sharh Manzümat al-Bayqüniyya (Aleppo: Maktabat Dãr al-Falãh, [n.d.]). 35; Ibn Kathlr, Ikhti$ãr cUlüm al-hadïth , 36; Muhammad al-GhazzãlI, Turãthunã al-fikrï , 8th ed.

Ibn al-Salãh provides a countervailing opinion, reminding his readers that any hadith with a flawed meaning would by definition not have a $ahih isnãd , since that would undermine the whole reliance on isnãds to begin with. Rather, such a hadith would necessarily be suffering from some undetected flaw in its isnãd. If a matn is not $ahih in its meaning, says Ibn al-Salãh, then it is "impossible ( muhãld )" that it have a $ahih isnãd. This disparity in understanding the definition of sihha led the modern Moroccan traditionalist 'Abdallah b. al-§iddlq al-Ghumãrl (d. 1 993) to the very controversial act of compiling a book of hadlths that he considered shãdhdh due to their meaning even though some appeared via authenticated isnãds in the §ahihayn of al-Bukhãrl and Muslim. Revealing his understanding that previous scholars had not taken shudhüdh into consideration when declaring the matns of hadlths reliable, he remarks about one anthropomorphic report that such a hadith could not be accepted even if it were narrated "by the soundest of chains (a$ahh al-asãnid)' Abu Amr cUthmãn b. cAbd al-Rahmãn Ibn al-§alãh, Fatãwã wa masä'il Ibn al~$alãh , ed.

Responding to Goldzihers critique of the lack of content criticism among early hadïth critics like al-Bukhârï, the Ottoman arch- traditionalist Muhammad Zãhid al-Kawtharï (d. 1952) actually con- cedes the point. Content criticism (naqd dãkhili ), he rebuts, was not undertaken by hadlth critics. It was, however, performed by jurists: "The two groups divided up the [different] aspects of hadïth criticism (wal-fariqãn taqãsamã wujüh naqd al-hadïth) ."90 This division of labor and the admission that early hadlth critics did not see content criticism as part of their duties provides a solution for dealing with problematic hadïths today: even if a particular isnãd is sahïhy it is ultimately the jurist who decides whether the accompanying matn truly represents the Prophets teachings. For scholars like al-Ghazzâlï and the current rector of al-Azhar, Shaykh Ahmad al-Tayyib, this division of labor serves as part of their effort to subordinate the hadïth corpus to the jurists' framework for interpreting Islamic law ( usül al-fìqh)?x Muslim reformist scholars like cAbduh and Ridã upheld the divine origin of the Qur'an and the Prophet s teachings. In effect, however, they accepted that modern science and ethical sensibilities are onto- logically and epistemologically equal to or greater than the message of revealed text. In the case of the Qur'an, its historical reliability as a document meant that defending it was not a question of authenticity but of finding charitable interpretations for any verses that seemed to clash with modernity. The hadïth corpus, plagued by forgery from the beginning, has not enjoyed this protection. The pre-modern Sunni surrender to the authority of sahih hadïths as authenticated revelation, however, has survived alongside these re- formers and their ruminations on content criticism.

For Late Sunni Traditionalists,93 who see themselves as direct continuations of the later-Middle Period (in the Hodgsonian sense, i.e, circa 1200-1500 CE) institutional traditions of Islamic civilization, modernity is simi- larly an upstart force that should quiver before the revealed truth and the ummas preserved embodiment of it. We see the tension between the notion of content criticism as an objective method and fears of the subjective empowerment of reason over revelation played out fiercely between Muslim reformists and tra- ditionalists. An excellent example is the Hadïth of the Sun Prostrating, which acted as the centerpiece in a debate that raged furiously in Egypt between Rashïd Ridã and a leading Mâlikï scholar and al-Azhar tradi- tionalist, Yüsuf al-Dijwï (d. 1946). These two opponents contended vociferously in the pages of their respective journals, al-Manãr and Majallat al-Azhar. In this particular hadïth, the Prophet explains to his Companions that when the sun sets it proceeds before the throne of God and seeks permission to rise once again. The hadïth is found in the Sahihayn and other relied-upon Sunni texts, and most versions of the hadïth include a prediction that one day the sun will rise in the west as a harbinger of the end of time.94 92) I use this term to distinguish the group refered to here from modernist Salafïs like Muhammad cAbduh and Rashïd Rida.

Classical critics like al-Bukhârï mastered transmission criticism, Ridã attests, but content criticism "was not in their craft." Moreover, they had no inkling of modern scientific discoveries. Today, Ridã explains, we know based on the "certainties of sense perceptions" that the Hadïth of the Sun Pros- trating is false. To lend his argument classical credibility, he refers explic- itly to the post fifth/eleventh-century rule of content criticism that rejects a report if it contradicts certainties and reason. Ridã acknowl- edges that one might understand this hadïth metaphorically but rejects this option because it is riddled with "affectedness ( taklïf )" and because it breaks with the evident, literal meaning of the hadlth.96 For Ridã, the hadlth s embarrassing clash with modern astronomical reality seems to have closed the space for charitable interpretations that could have reconciled the two. Or perhaps Ridã was merely demanding an honest and unaffected reading of the text. Ridã expressed unmasked contempt for those scholars who insisted on the authenticity of such hadïths. In his reflections on his many longstanding debates with al-Dijwï and Majallat al-Azhar , Ridã refers to the Hadïth of the Suns Prostration as a crystalline example of the stubborn obscurantism of the unreformed al-Azhar scholars. Praising 'Abduh for challenging the Azharï emphasis on blind obedience to established texts, Ridã bemoans how criticizing a hadïth that had been deemed sahih could nonetheless result in a person being accused of disbelief ( kufr ). This could occur even though material in hadïth books clearly contradicts scientific empirical evidence and sense perception.97 Interestingly, Ridã marshals evidence of how classical Muslim jurists had themselves intimated that the Hadïth of the Suns Prostration was problematic. He cites the influential Shàfi'ï jurist and legal theorist 95) Ibn Hajar, Fath , 6:368; al-Nawawï, Sharh Sahih Muslim, 19 vols, in 10 (Beirut: Dãr al-Qalam, [n.d.]), 2:555. 96) Rashid Ridã, al-Manãr 27, no. 8 (1926): 615-6. 97) Ridã, al-Manãr wa'l-Azhar (Cairo: Matba'at al-Manãr, 1353/[1934]), 19-20.</page><page sequence="35">390 J.

Brown / Islamic Law and Society 19 (2012) 356-396 Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwaynï (d. 478/1085) as saying that the sun is always visible somewhere, setting and rising in different places accord- ing to latitude (it should be noted that al-Juwaynï s comment comes in a discussion of prayer times and is not directly connected to the Hadïth of the Sun Prostrating).98 Ridas exasperation mounts as he recounts how some benighted al-Azhar scholars still defend the evident (zãhir) meaning of the hadïth. He is stunned that some, like Yùsuf al-Dijwï, even declare anyone who does not believe it an unbeliever." In truth, however, Ridã seems to have been exaggerating al-Dijwïs position. Al-Dijwï was furious with Ridã for choosing to opine arro- gantly on all matters political and scientific without deference to the interpretive tradition built up by Muslim scholars. In the case of the Hadïth of the Suns Prostration, Ridã preferred to go so far as to claim that Prophetic knowledge does not cover scientific matters rather than to find some figurative interpretation for the hadïth. "And how wide the Arabic language is in the hands of one who knows it!," al-Dijwï protests.100 From al-Dijwïs perspective, Ridã not only dismissed the authentication process of al-Bukhàrï and Muslim but also constrained the Prophet s knowledge and rejected his words, "an audaciousness that is not permissible for a Muslim who believes in God and His Mes- senger."101 For al-Dijwï, it is not the contents of the hadïth that are really in question in this debate. The suns prostration can always be interpreted figuratively. Rather, it is the ontological and epistemologi- ca! standing of scripture vis-à-vis competing epistemologies, in this case, modern science.' Interestingly, Muslim clerics had faced this competition before, if only on the margin of their intellectual world. The Hanbalï scholar of Damascus, Ibn Rajab (d. 795/1392), rejects with complete scorn those skeptical astronomers who had used their observations to dismiss 98) Ibn Hajar al-Haytamï, al-Fatãwã al-hadïthiyya , 249. 99) Ridã rebuts the hadïth from another front as well, stating that he had found a flaw ('ilia) in its isnãd' Ridã, al-Manãr wa'l-Azhar , 1 9-20. i°o) Yüsuf al-Dijwï, Maqãlãt wa fatãwã al-Shaykh Yüsuf al-Dijwï, ed.

The last third of the night, protested these scientists, actually occurs at different times in different lands. How could God descend in all of them? Ibn Rajab responds sharply that, if the Prophet and the Companions had heard such an objection, they would have immediately considered its author a hypocrite and a rejector of Islam.102 A similar case illustrates the extent to which objections to the mean- ings of a hadïth are amplified or diffused by the hegemonic context. A hadïth appearing in Sahïh Muslim tells how, when Moses was ap- proached by the Angel of Death to take his life, he struck the angel and knocked out its eye. The angel complained to God, who healed the eye, and then returned to Moses and completed his task.103 Premodern Mus- lim scholars sensed the incomprehensibility of a human being knocking out an angel s eye as well as the problem of why a prophet would resist an angel to begin with. Al-Nawawï reports that some "godless folk (; malãhida )" overtly doubted the hadïth based on what they saw as its absurd meaning.104 Sunni scholars, however, resolved the confusion by resorting to creative interpretations rather than questioning the authen- ticity of the statements attribution to the Prophet. Qâdï 'Iyãd b. Mûsâ (d. 544/ 1 149) proposed that this "authentic report {al-khabar al-sahïh)" be understood as Moses defending himself against an unknown attacker, for the Angel of Death had appeared initially in human form.105 Modern reformists have allowed no such charity for this hadïth.

Interestingly, Qâdï cIyãd b. Mûsâ uses the natural motion of heavenly bodies to defend against skepticism about hadïths reporting that the Prophet had miraculously split the moon as a sign for the unbelievers in Mecca.

Third/ninth-century Mu'tazilïs dismissed the hadïth as absurd, questioning how an animal could carry both a disease and its cure. Classical Sunnis like Ibn Qutayba committed themselves to countering this skepticism. The fourth/ tenth- century Shâfi'ï jurist Hamd al-Khattâbï (d. 388/998) rebutted these critics by pointing out that other animals, such as bees, do indeed com- bine a poison and some benefit. Responding more directly to the ratio- nalist criticism, he stated that the flesh of certain poisonous snakes is used in concocting the antidote to their venom.108 Perhaps more suc- cinctly than anyone, he reiterated the Sunni outlook on reason versus revelation: This is one of the issues denied by those who accept as proof only what their external or internal senses apprehend (hassuhu wa mushãhadãtuhu) and only what they affirm according to current convention (al-urf al-jãrí) and expe- rience {al-tajriba al-qâ'ima). As for those whose hearts God has illuminated with His knowledge and whose chests He has expanded with the establish- ment of the prophethood of His Messenger (s), indeed they do not reject ( yastankiru ) it if it is established by narration ( al-riu&gt;ãya ) . . . and the authen- ticity of narration and receiving it via transmission together both obligate submission to it (al-taslïm) and dispense with the substance of any deviant objections (yaqta'âni mãddat al-ashãghíb) . 109 i°6) Mahmud Abu Rayya, Adwã' (alã al-sunna al-muhammadiyya (Cairo: Maçba'at Dãr al-Ta'lïf, 1958), 198. 107) Al-Ghazzâlï, al-Sunna al-nabawiyyay 35-38. 108) Abu Sulaymãn Hamd al-Khaççâbï, Alãm al-hadïth ft shark Sahïh al-Bukhârï , ed.

Brown / Islamic Law and Society 19 (2012) 356-396 393 In the modern period, these same arguments have been repeated, with the added ingredient of modern medicine. In a landmark 1906 article in al-Manãr , the Egyptian physician Muhammad Tawflq Sidqï (d. 1920) launched a scathing attack on the Shariahs reliance on hadïths. He cited the Hadlth of the Fly as a key example of how Mus- lims had admitted ridiculous material into their body of scripture. Not only is pushing a fly into ones drink and then drinking it unsanitary, it also contradicts other reports from the Prophet that instructed Mus- lims to pour out oil or liquid butter into which a rodent had fallen.110 Although he did not share Sidqf s extreme critique of the hadïth corpus, Ridã had to admit that the Hadlth of the Fly was problematic. Rida concluded that, since the hadlth was not massively transmitted ( mutawãtir ), believing in its meaning was optional. He directly repeated al-Khattãbí s statement about the flesh of a poisonous snake, however, to buttress the scientific merit of the hadlth.111 A vigorous traditionalist defense of the authenticity and literal truth of the Hadïth of the Fly has been mounted recently by the Syrian 'älim Khalïl Mullã Khãtir. In his work al-Isãba fi sihhat hadïth al-dhubãba , Mullã Khãtir defends both the isnãd and the matn of the hadlth, argu- ing that it is fully reliable and has been widely used by jurists from almost every school of law. More importantly, he challenges the extreme credence that many people have in modern science to begin with. He remarks that throughout history much of what we thought was im- possible has turned out to be otherwise.112 Especially in the twentieth century, rapid changes in science continually render our notion of the possible and impossible obsolete. For example, only a few years before the United States landed a man on the moon many would have thought such an accomplishment impossible.113 Mullã Khãtir introduces an interesting methodological distinction that he feels is lacking amongst hadlth skeptics: the difference between what is considered bizarre or unlikely (yastaghribün ) and what is impos- sible ( mustahil ).

A. C. Brown / Islamic Law and Society 19 (2012) 356-396 whereas when we consider something bizarre or highly unlikely, we do so because of the limitations of our own reason. It seems, says Mullã Khãtir, that skeptics of hadlth have confused what is impossible with what is inconceivable or unacceptable to the Western worldview.114 A call for a humbler approach to Islamic scripture also comes from Yùsuf al-Qaradâwï. Regarding scientific skepticism towards hadlths, he explains that the difference between Sunnis and Mu'tazilïs is that "we [Sunnis] look for possible interpretations ( ta'wil &gt; mahmat) for hadlths." This entails that, if a report is established by isnäd criticism as having come from the Prophet ( idhä sahha thubütuhu ), then it is a grave error to reject it simply because one considers it rationally improbable ( istib(ãdãt ' aqliyya ).115 In the case of hadlths long considered sahïh , al-Qaradâwï states that he prefers to trust them "out of the fear that perhaps the meaning has not been revealed to me yet."116 After all, he reminds his readers, revealed religion can bring to mankind ideas or rules that they cannot understand, such as the Hadlth of the Fly. This is not objectionable so long as an item of attributed revelation does not go against reason.117 Conclusion On the one hand, a scholar confronted with a hadlth can be governed by a methodological sense of awe towards attributed revelation and a commitment to reading it charitably. On the other hand, the scholar s willingness to accept the hadïth as revelation might be overpowered by the extra-textual hegemony of 'reason,' 'science' or common sense.' The tension between these two reactions to texts has been a central theme in Sunni scriptural scholarship. This tension is, in fact, built into the very corpus of authoritative narrations on which the Sunni intel- lectual tradition is built. The method of transmission criticism devel- oped by early Sunnis was designed to remove the inherently subjective mechanism of reason from the evaluation of a hadïth s authenticity.

Brown / Islamic Law and Society 19 (2012) 356-396 395 even if scholars focused on transmission to determine reliability, a matn that struck them as problematic or deviant invited special criticism of its isnãd and perhaps made finding some damning flaw inevitable. Thus, subjectivity remained ingrained in the process. The Ash'arï amalgamation of Mu'tazilï rationalism with Sunni tenets of faith raised this tension to the level of systemic, if minor, schizo- phrenia in the Sunni methodology of hadïth criticism. Sunni hadïth scholars from the fifth/eleventh century onward were committed to definitive rules of content criticism even though these same scholars often affirmed the original Sunni lAhlal-hadïth principle of subordinat- ing reason to the power of revelation. Certainly, Sunni scholars agreed that one could dismiss a hadïth for content reasons only after one had searched for reconciliatory readings. But the extent to which one might comfortably depart from the literal meaning of a hadlth or the amount of charity one extended it depended on both the perspective and incli- nation of the scholar in question. As such, the same hadlth might strike some Muslim scholars as having an unacceptable meaning while others might integrate it into their religious worldview. A scholar like al-Dhahabï leapt on the evident meaning of hadïths that struck him as false without exerting much effort at finding an acceptable interpreta- tion. Conversely, Mullã cAll al-Qárť tended to exhaust alternative inter- pretations for hadïths whose isnãds were passable. The most noticeable shift in discourse over content criticism occurs with the Muslim confrontation with Western modernity. Like European Christian scholars in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Muslim clerics in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries had to contend with a force that, for the first time, presented a daunting challenge to the supremacy of revelation (or attributions of revelation in the case of hadïths) as the chief structure behind their scientific, historical and ethical world. Hadïths like that of the Fly or the Sun Prostrating had raised eyebrows in the premodern era, but in the modern period rever- ence for the text and willingness to indulge hermeneutic gymnastics shriveled before a fear of appearing backwards or unscientific. The great question underlying this discourse is the broader problem of distinguishing between the absolute and the relative, between a real- ity existing apart from us and our own convention. In Greek this dicho- tomy was conceived of as that of Physis (nature) and Nomos (law) - what</page><page sequence="41">396 J. A. C. Brown / Islamic Law and Society 19 (2012) 356-396 is the truly real and natural order as opposed to a culture s convention. Our species has erred frequently in confusing Nomos with Physis . This was Pauls mistake when he told his Corinthian audience that "physis (nature)" tells us that long hair is beautiful on women but shameful on men (the royal family of the Merovingian Franks would disagree). This is where Seneca erred in his criticism of transvestites: "Do you not think that it is living unnaturally ( contra naturam) to exchange one s clothes for women's?"118 Ibn Khaldùn (d. 808/1406) manifested the same naïveté when he dismissed a report of Harun al-Rashid s sister seducing one of the Barmakid viziers, objecting that she was a noble Arab woman "descended from the men around Muhammad and his uncles," so such a sin would be beneath her.119 The distinction between Physis and Nomos underlies the challenge of drawing the line between the probable and improbable, the possible and impossible. Our own Nomos almost always defines what we believe. It seems much rarer for an agnostic attitude to lead us to an openness to the possible rather than skepticism of it. Only a scholar as humble as Montaigne (d. 1592), fresh in the wake of the European discovery of the wondrous New World, could warn his readers against pretending "to a knowledge of the farthest extent of possibility" and conflating "the impossible and the unusual."120 The founding ethos of Sunni Islam was to subordinate mans inevitably limited Nomos to the certainty of rev- elation. One can imagine Mullã Khãtir enjoining both Paul and Seneca to heed the distinction between what is unnatural and what a person s own bias and background make him reject. Mullã Khãtir is very Sunni in his writing, reminding us that reason is never free from the blinders of convention and ignorance. As Pindar observed early on in human memory, "custom {Nomos) is king of all."121 U8) 1 Corinthians 11: 15-16; Seneca, Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium, xxii:7. 119) Ibn Khaldùn, The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History , trans.
