<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME QUERIES ON THE NEW PSALTER T. E. Bird The New Latin Psalter1 has its excellences: it is much closer to the Hebrew text than is the Gallican Psalter; it has made sense of many pas- sages that were senseless; it gives us a translation that is eminently readable, and, at the same time, dignified and arresting; while the division of the lines and the introduction of stanzas facilitate the understanding of the Psalmist's argument. The New Psalter also has its deficiencies. Some half dozen corrections have already been made in the second edition, and the translators graciously invite suggestions of further corrigenda . In the margin of my copy I have several question-marks. Some of these may be of interest to readers of the Quarterly. Ps. 1. V. 1. Beatus vir, qui non sequitur consilium impiorum, Et viam peccatorum non ingreditur , et in conventu protervorum non sedit. The inspired writer, however, would have us picture the good man in the three attitudes of walking , standing and sitting ( halak , 'amad, yashab). This is lost in the new translation; indeed, "sequitur consilium" spoils the picture by giving a mental attitude. I suggest that the Gallican abiit, s teti t, sedit is nearer the inspired text. V. 3e. prospere procedunt. One would prefer the 1st per. sing, of MT, Jer. ( prosperabitur ): "he bringeth to success" or "he maketh to prosper," although I agree that it is difficult to express this in Latin - "evenire pros- pere efficit" (?), unless this last verb clashes with 'faciť. V. 6a. Quoniam Dominus curat viam iustorum. The rendering of the verb yadaK in the new version is somewhat disconcerting. That it may sometimes have the sense of "care for" (by reference to Arabic) is main- tained by Schultens and Margoliouth,2 but this meaning is not included in the Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon, sub voce ; and, without any doubt, scores and scores of times, in the OT, the verb has simply the meaning to know. Having adopted, however, the meaning care "for" here in Ps. 1, the transla- tors might have been expected to use it in later Pss., especially when the Qal participle re-occurs; but we only find it again in 36:18 and 143:3, where the preposition de is added. Here are renderings of the vb, with God as 1 Referred to in these pages as NP. 2 See art. by D. Winton Thomas, in JTS XXXV (July, 1934), p. 298ff. 76</page><page sequence="2">Some Queries on the New Psalter 77 the subject: 30 :8d. adiuvisti in angustiis animam meam (Qal pf .) 36:18a.

Domine, quid est homo, quod curas de eoi (Qal impf.) In our opinion there is no compelling reason for departing from the tradi- tional rendering of 1:6, supported, as it is, not only by the most likely meaning of yada' but also by the Greek translators and by St Jerome: "Quoniam novit Dominus viam iustorum." Ps. 2. V. 4a. Qui habitat in caelis, ńdet. Reference to 36:13 and 58:9 (the latter obviously dependent on this verse of Ps. 2) should convince a reader that the LXX, reading lamo after the verb, gives the original reading. This is supported by rhyme and the eis, eos , eos of 4b, 5ab. Assonance, also, favours the Gallican irridere. We would read : Qui habitat in caelis irridet eos, Dominus illudit eis. Vv. 11, 12. A crux interpretům . The Gallican text had to be corrected. The editors have given a solution by transposing the soph pasuq (end of the verse) from after to before cum tremore; then extending MT bar to beragla- {y)w. This latter emendation had already been suggested - by Lagrange, Dhorme (RB vol. 32 (1923) p. 207), Bertholet, Calés, Oesterley, Lattey, and others; it gives: "kiss his feet," "osculamini pedes eius," which, for no apparent reason, has been paraphrased to: "praestate obsequium illi." As Pss. 2 and 109 are companions, and in the latter the Messias' enemies are prostrate at his throne, it may well be that the emendation is correct.</page><page sequence="3">78 Some Queries on the New Psalter In the Hebrew, however, "his feet" could only refer to Yahweh's feet, and this gives an anthropomorphism which is without parallel in the OT. The main reasons for rejecting MT bar , "son" are that it is late Hebrew or Aramaic and that the usual word ben is found in v. 7. Yet its retention would put Yahweh and His Son in each stanza: v. 2, Yahweh and His anointed (king); v. 6, Yahweh and His King; v. 7, Yahweh and His Son; v. 12, Yahweh and His Son (under another word). Parallelism and antith- esis are manifest. It may be worth while noticing that in Isaias 16:1, instead of the difficult kar , "lamb," the Syriac read bar , "son." The pas- sage 16:1-5 is messianic; a throne is to be established in mercy; a king of the House of David shall sit thereon; he will seek justice and excel in up- rightness. We would have retained justa after via ; more commonly words fall out than come in. Pss. 3 and 4 do not call for comment; the renderings are excellent. Ps. 5. V. 4b. mane propono tibi preces et expecto. Here we have an inter- pretation rather than a translation, for neither in the Hebrew text nor in any of the ancient versions do we find preces meas . The verb (arak means arrange or set in order : It is used of setting things out on a table as in (NP) : 22:5. Paras mihi mensám 77:19. parare mensám in deserto or of preparing things used in divine worship (altar, sacrificial offerings, wood, lamps, shewbread),3 or of composing a speech (Job 32:14; 33:5; 38 : 19, although the last two passages are not certain) . But the most com- mon meaning is prepare for battle (about 20 times in the OT.). I know of no instance where the meaning is " arrange prayers ." The interpretation, therefore, in the new Psalter is very dubious. For my part, I prefer the meaning prepare for battle , that is, draw up in battle array. The Ps. sup- poses that enemies are bent on deposing the speaker (vv. 5-7, 9-11), and the verb that follows ęaphah (expecto) means "keep a sharp look, out," as a watchman, cf. Is. 21:6; Mich. 7:4. The Gallican astabo tibi seems to have read the verb 'amad, which gives, according to Joüon, "excellent sense."4 He adds that the two verbs "are borrowed from phraseology associated with sentries or watchmen" and occur together in Jeremias 48:19; Habacuc 2:1. See also Isaias 21:6. V. 5. Tu enim non es Deus, cui placeat iniquitas , 3 See references in my Commentary 1, 106-7. 4 Biblica 2 (1930) p. 81.</page><page sequence="4">Some Queries on the New Psalter 79 malignus apud te non commoratur. Parallelism demands either iniquitas , malitia or iniquus , malignus. Ps. 6 calls for no improvement. Ps. 7. V. 5b. qui salvavi adversantes mihi iniuste. The plural of LXX, Jer., is rightly preferred to MT sing; but, for parallelism's sake, 5a should read amicis meis instead of amico meo (cf. LXX, Jer.). Further, although 5b reads easily, it is doubtful whether the Heb. will allow it; moreover, we would expect something parallel to 5a. MT reads, literally: "and may I deliver mine adversary emptily" (verb piel, impf, cohort.), which is usually rendered as a parenthesis, ("but I delivered him who was without cause mine adversary"), a rather unsatisfactory solution. Some commentators adopt an "Aramaic" meaning of the verb, viz., "despoil"; so Zorell "ex- poliavi," D 'Ey ragúes and Calés "dépouillé," thereby preserving good parallelism : If I have requited evil to my friends, And despoiled mine adversaries without cause. And although objections are raised against this so-called Aramaism, it should be noted that the noun occurs in 2 Sam. 2 : 21 ; Judges 14 : 19. Agelli corrected the vb from halaę to shalah (piel, "send away"), and this, indeed, is what S. Jerome may have read: "et dimisi hostes meos vacuos," a line that gives excellent sense and parallelism, and supposes a common ex- pression, cf. Gen. 31:42; Deut. 15:13; 1 Sam. 6:3, etc., also Lk. 1:35). The Targum and Syriac read vb. lahaę ; hence the West. Version : "Or oppressed him that without cause was my foe"; this involves merely the inverting of two letters in MT. Ps. 8. We have no criticism to make here beyond warning the reader that curas de eo (5b) is quite a different vb. than that discussed in 1:6. Here we have paqad which means "attend, visit," here in the sense "pay heed (to him)." Ps. 9 (Heb). Some might ask whether Celebrado (v. 2) is the best Latin rendering of ' odeh ; otherwise it would be difficult to find any fault in this Ps. Ps. 9:22-39 (Heb. 10).</page><page sequence="5">80 Some Queries on the New Psalter V. 26 (5). Prosperae sunt viae eius omni tempore. This translation is very likely but not quite certain. The vb. hil is only found elsewhere in Job 20:21, "his prosperity (lit. "good things") is not firm" (Vg: "nihil per- manent de bonis eius"); hence Buhl suggests changing the verb to salah, "prosper." On the other hand, LXX, Syr., Vg, read vb. halal, "profane"; hence, Gallican: "inquinatae sunt" and Zorell "Profanatae sunt." Briggs remarks that this "best suits context." V. 38 (17). Desiderium miserorum audisti, Domine, confirmasti cor eorum, aurem praebuisti, The second line at once sounds strange to the ear, the reason being that we have two sentences while in the rest of the stanza we have one in each line. Aurem praebuisti is parallel to audisti and so must stand; but we want a proper parallel to Desiderium miserorum . LXX, Syr., and Aquila read a noun (Vg. "praeparationem cordis eorum"), probably t'kunath instead of the vb. takin, MT. - For the idea of right dispositions of heart, implying steadfastness, see Pss. 56:8; 107:2; 111:7. See also 5: 10, where the participle of the vb. is used as a noun - nekunah , translated in the new version by sinceritas - "Nam in ore istorum non est sincérités ." One might also question whether the meaning of darash has not been stretched in w. 25 (Heb 10:4), 34 (13), 36 (15), "vindicabit" (bis), "vindi- cabis." There may be an underlying idea of avenging , but what the wicked man really says is that God does not bother to notice or to investigate the deeds of men. We would give the vb. the meaning it has in Soph. 1:7, Vg. "investigaverunt." Ps. 10. V. 4c. Oculi eius respiciunt. Over-fidelity to MT prevents the editors from adding an object. The line obviously demands another word. LXX AB read lehel9kah, and this is confirmed by 10 (Heb.): 8, 10, 14 (NP "pauperem"). But LXX U, Syr., and Theod., read I'heled , "the world." Ps. 11 calls for no comment. Ps. 12. V. 3. Quousque volvam dolores in anima mea maerorem in corde meo cotidie? Following Buhl, Briggs, Zorell, Calés, Herkenne, Lattey and others, the editors read 'aęęaboth instead of MT, LXX, Jer., 'eęoth, which, although lacking textual authority (except Syr.) gives good parallelism. V. 6. The final line of LXX, Vg.: "et psallam nomini Domini altissimi"</page><page sequence="6">Some Queries on the New Psalter 81 is omitted. It is not found in MT, Jer. It may have crept in from 71 18, and its retention or rejection depends on the arrangement of the distichs from v. 4 to the end. We would prefer to begin the second stanza with 4a, instead of making this line the second member of 3c; thereby making parallel Respice . . . illustra; Ne dicat inimicus meus . . . ne excultent ad- versariii mei ; Cum confisus sim . . . exsultet cor meum; Cantem Damino . . . et psaUam . Ps. 13. V. 5a. tum trepidabunt timore. It is doubtful whether sham can have this temporal sense; the versions and most commentators agree on the local meaning. The Psalmist has in mind some historical occasion unknown to us. For a suggestion see my Commentary I, p. 143. The editors have omitted "ubi non erat timor" of the Gallican Psalter, for the reason that it is only found in LXX. But when the Psalm recurs as Ps. 52, all author- ities have the phrase. Those who hold that, generally speaking, words fall out rather than slip into OT writings would favor the retention here. Certainly the phrase is part of inspired Scripture. Ps. 14. V. 4c. Qui, etsi iuravit cum damno suo, non mutât. The translators have adhered to MT, supported by Jer. Many, however, would have preferred a retention of "proximo suo," Vg, LXX, Syr., i&gt;e. Vre1 oh for l9hara% ; for it is not clear what MT really means, whereas the alternative gives good sense. It is adopted by Briggs, Oesterley, and Lattey. As Fr. Lattey remarks, the rendering is "reasonably certain." Ps. 15. A difficult Psalm well rendered by the translators. The only alteration we would suggest is "bonum meum " (v. 2b.), instead of "bonum mihi": Heb. tobathiy not tóbah li; there is a difference between "my welfare" and "welfare for me." {To be continued)</page></plain_text>
