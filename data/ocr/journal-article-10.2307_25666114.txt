CHAPTER I.?The Religious Circle of Romantic Art. Since, in the representation of absolute subjectivity or per sonality as final and complete truth, Romantic Art has for its substantial content the union of the spirit with its essence, the satisfaction of the soul, the reconciliation of God with the world, ? and, by this means, his reconciliation with Himself, ? it is upon this stage that the Ideal appears for the first time to be completely at home. For it was happiness and independ ence, satisfaction, tranquillity, and freedom which we declared to be the fundamental characteristic of the ideal. Unques tionably, we cannot venture to exclude the ideal from the con ception and the reality of Romantic Art; and yet, in relation to the Classic ideal, it acquires a wholly different form. Though we have already pointed out this relation in a general way, we must here, at the beginning, clearly define (feststellen) its more concrete significance, in order to make manifest the essential type of the Romantic mode of representing the Ab solute. In the Classic ideal the divine is, on the one hand, a * XIII?8</page><page sequence="2">114 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. limited to individuality. On the other, the soul and happi ness of the particular gods become manifest exclusively through their corporeal forms ; and, again, since the principle of the individual in itself and in its externality is set forth in the inseparable unity of the individual, it is evident that the neg ativity of the inherent tendency to dissolution, of corporeal and of spiritual anguish, of sacrifice, of resignation, cannot appear as an essential moment. The divine of Classic Art, indeed, falls asunder into a circle of divinities. But it does not separate itself, within itself, as universal essentiality on the one hand, and as particular, subjective, empirical manifesta tion in human form and human spirit on the other. Just as little, too, does it, as non-phenomenal Absolute, possess a world of evil, of sin, and of error; with the task, on the con trary, of bringing this contradiction into reconciliation, and, as this reconciliation, to be for the first time the truly actual and divine. In the conception of absolute subjectivity, on the other hand, there lies the contradiction between substan tial universality and personality; a contradiction whose com pleted mediation fills the subjective or personal with its sub stance, and elevates the substantial to the rank of an absolute subject, possessing self-knowledge and rational will. But to the actuality of personality (Subjektivitdf) as spirit there belongs, in the second place, the deeper contradiction of a finite world, through the cancellation of which as finite, and its reconciliation with the Absolute, the infinite itself creates its own essence, through its own absolute activity, for itself; and is thus, for the first time, absolute spirit. The manifestation of this actuality on the ground and under the form of the human spirit acquires, therefore, with respect to its beauty, a relation altogether different from that in Classic Art. Greek beauty exhibits the inner quality of spiritual individuality, conceived wholly in its corporeal form, its deeds and its adventures, com pletely expressed in the external, and dwelling happily therein. For Romantic Art, on the contrary, it is absolutely necessary that the soul, although it appears in the external, should at the same time show itself to be gone out of this corporeal state back into itself, and to live within itself. At this stage,</page><page sequence="3">Hegel on Romantic Art. 115 therefore, the corporeal can express the internality of the spirit only in so far as it brings into manifestation the fact that the soul has its congruent actuality, not in this real existence, but in itself. Upon this ground beauty is now no longer consid ered as the idealizing of the objective form, but as the inner form of the soul in itself. It is a beauty of internality which is to be looked upon rather as form and manner (als Art und Weise), in accordance with which each content is fashioned and de veloped in the inner being of the person. It is, therefore, a beauty which refuses to hold fast the external, even while the external is thus pervaded by spirit. Since, therefore, the in terest is now lost, so far as concerns the purifying of real outer existence to the point of this classical unity, and is con centrated upon the opposite aim of inbreathing the inner form of the spiritual itself with a new beauty, art gives itself little concern respecting the external. Just as it finds it immedi ately at hand, so it accepts it immediately; while even on this side it leaves it to be, as it were, fashioned at discretion. In Romantic Art, reconciliation with the Absolute is an act of the inner nature which, indeed, appears in the external, but which does not have the external itself in its real form as an essen tial content and aim. Along with this indifference respecting the idealizing union of soul and body there appears, for the special individuality of the external side essentially, portrait ure, which does not obliterate particular features and forms, as they come and go, the requirements of the natural, the im perfections of the mortal state, in order to replace them with more appropriate characteristics. True, in this relation a cor respondence must, in general, still be required ; but the precise form it is to take becomes indifferent, and does not purify itself from the accidentality of finite empirical existence. The necessity for this thorough-going characterization of Romantic Art may likewise be justified from still another side. The Classic ideal, when it stands upon its own true height, is secluded within itself, independent, reserved, non-receptive, a complete or rounded individual, which excludes others from itself. Its form is its own. It lives wholly and exclusively within this form, and dares not expose any portion of itself</page><page sequence="4">116 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. to participation in the merely empirical and accidental. Hence whoever, as spectator, approaches this ideal, cannot ap propriate to himself its existence as something external that is related to his own phenomenal being (Erscheinung). Though the forms of the eternal gods are human, they do not, for all that, pertain to the mortal state ; for these gods have not them selves suffered the infirmity of finite existence, but are raised above this,without mediation. Participation in the empirical and relative is broken off. On the contrary, infinite sub jectivity, the Absolute of Romantic Art, is not merged (ver senkt) in its manifestation. It exists within itself,.and by this veiy fact does not possess its externality as something belong ing essentially to itself, but as something other than itself, ? something quite freely set aside, and belonging to the indiffer ent or neglected beyond. Besides, this external must enter into the form of the common-place, of the empirically human, since here God himself descends into finite temporal exist ence, in order to mediate and to reconcile the absolute contra diction which lies in the conception of the Absolute. Thus empirical man also acquires a side from which there is opened to him a relationship, ? a connecting link, ? so that he himself may with confidence draw near in his immediate naturalness ; since the external form does not, through classic austerity (Strenge) toward the particular and accidental, repel him, but presents to his view that which he himself has, or which he knows and loves in some object in his immediate surround ings. It is through this air of being at home (Tleimath lichkeit) in ordinary affairs, that Romantic Art confidently exerts its attractiveness in all directions. But, since now the renounced externality has, through this very renunciation, the task of pointing to the beauty of the soul, to the loftiness of internality, to the holiness of spiritual existence, it tends at the same time to merge itself in the internal character of the spirit and in its absolute content, and to appropriate to itself this inner nature. In this surrender (Ilingabe), finally, there lies, in general, the universal idea that in Romantic Art infinite subjectivity is not solitary and alone within itself, like a Greek god, which lived</page><page sequence="5">Hegel on Romantic Art. 117 within itself, wholly complete in the happiness of its seclu sion. Rather it comes forth from itself and enters into rela tion with another. But this "other" still belongs to subr jectivity, which finds itself again therein and remains in unity with itself. This unit-being (Einseyn) of subjectivity in its " other " is the unique, beautiful content of Romantic Art, the ideal of the same, which has essentially for its form and man ifestation, internality and subjectivity, soul, sensibility. The Romantic Ideal, therefore, expresses a relation to other spir itual being, which is so bound up with internality that it is only precisely in this other that the soul in internality lives with itself. This life virtually in another is, as sensibility, the sincerity and fervor of love. We can, therefore, declare Love to be the universal content of the Romantic in its religious circle. Still, love first acquires its true ideal form when it expresses the affirmative, immedi ate reconciliation of the spirit. But now, before we can, upon this stage, consider the most beautiful ideal satisfaction, we have previously, on the one side, to traverse the process of negativity, into which the absolute subject, or person, enters, as subjugation of the finitude and immediacy of its human manifestation,?a process which unfolds itself in the life, suffer ing, and death of God for the world and humanity, and its possible reconciliation with God. On the other side, it is humanity which now, on the contrary, has on its part to com plete the same process, in order that in itself there may be made actual what is as yet only potential in the reconcilia tion referred to. In the midst of this stage, in which the neg ative side of the sensuous and spiritual entrance into death and the grave constitutes the central point, lies the expression of the affirmative bliss of the contentment, which in this circle belongs to the most beautiful objects of art. Division. ? For the more precise division of our first chap ter, therefore, we have three different spheres to pass through. 1. The history of the redemption of Christ. The moments or elements of the absolute spirit represented in God himself, in so far as he becomes man, has an actual outer existence in</page><page sequence="6">118 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. the world of finitude and its concrete relations, and in this most uniquely particular outer-existence brings the absolute itself into manifestation. 2. Love in its positive form, as reconciled feeling of the human and the divine; the holy family, the maternal love of Mary, the love of Christ, and the love of the disciples. 3. The Church; the spirit of God as present in humanity through the conversion of the soul, and the destruction of mere naturalness and finitude, generally through the return of man to God, ? a return in which, first of all, repentance and martyrdom constitute the mediation between man and God. /. History of Redemption through Christ. 1. Art apparently superfluous.?2. Its necessary intervention.?3. Accidental particulars of the external representation. The reconciliation of the spirit with itself, absolute his tor}', the process of the truth, is brought to view and certi tude through the manifestation of God in the world. The simple content of this reconciliation is the combination or blending (Ineinssetzung) of absolute essentiality with particu lar human subjectivity ; an individual man is God, and God is an individual man. Herein lies the fact that virtually ? that is, according to conception and essence?-humanity is truly spirit; and each particular subject or person, therefore, as man, possesses infinite destiny and importance, namely, to exist as a purpose of God, and to be in unity with God. But in just the same measure man becomes subject to the demand to give actuality to this conception, which is at first only a mere possibility (nur ein blosses Ansich) ; that is, to fix upon his own union with God as the goal of his existence, and to reach that goal. In so far as he has fulfilled this des tiny he is a free, infinite spirit. This he may do only in so far as the unity to which we have referred is the primordial ele ment, the eternal foundation of the human and the divine nature. The goal is at the same time the besrinnins:, existing in and for itself. It is the point of departure for Romantic religious consciousness, namely, that God himself is man,?</page><page sequence="7">Hegel on Romantic Art. 119 is flesh, ?in order that he may become this individual subject or person, in whom, therefore, the reconciliation does not remain a mere possibility, in which case it would be known only in the abstract conception thereof; but rather he pre sents himself as existing objectively, even for the perceiving (anschauende) consciousness, as this individual, actually-exist ing man. This moment or element of individuality is of importance, because therein each individual possesses the view of his own reconciliation with God, which in and for itself is no mere potentiality, but is actual, and for this reason has been brought into full manifestation as real in this one sub ject or person. But since now the unity, as spiritual recon ciliation of opposite moments, is no merely immediate individ ual-being (Einsseyn), there must, in the second place, be brought into existence in this one subject or person also the process of the spirit as history of the same, through which process the person for the first time truly becomes spirit. This history of the spirit undergoing completion in the individual contains .nothing else than what we have already referred to, namely, that the individual man shall put aside (abthue) his individuality in both the corporeal and the spiritual sense, ? that is, that he shall suffer and die ; but on the contrary shall, after the pain of death, reappear from the dead; shall arise as the glorified God, as the actual spirit which now, indeed, has entered into existence as an individual, as this subject or person; and yet, even so, is essentially only in truth God, as spirit in his Church. 1. This history furnishes the essential object for religious Romantic Art, but for which art, taken purely as art, doubtless becomes somewhat superfluous ; for the principal fact lies here in the inner certitude, in the sentiment and perception of this eternal truth, in faith, which bears testimony to the truth in and for itself, and thus becomes identified (hineinverlegt) with the inner nature of the imagination. Developed faith, namely, consists in the immediate certitude of having the truth itself present to the consciousness along with the conception of the moments, or elements, of this history. But if it is in the consciousness of the truth that the real interest centres, then</page><page sequence="8">120 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. the beauty of manifestation, as well as representation itself, is altogether an indifferent affair, since the truth is present to consciousness independent of art. 2. On the other hand, however, the religious content ac quires at the same time, in itself, the moment or element through which it not only becomes -accessible to, but in a certain sense demands, art. In the religious conception of Romantic Art, as we have already often affirmed (angefuhrf), the content itself bears within itself the tendency to carry anthropomorphism to the last degree of development; since this content has for its central point the being of the Absolute and the Divine, in combination with human subjectivity as actually visible (erschauten), and, therefore, also as external, corporeal, phenomenal, and must represent the Divine in this, its individuality, which is closely connected with the neces sities of nature and with finite modes of manifestation. In this respect art furnishes to the perceiving consciousness, for the manifestation of God in the immediate present, an actual individual form, even a concrete image of the external char acteristics of those events in which are unfolded the birth of Christ, His life and suffering, death, resurrection, and ascen sion to the right hand of God. It is, therefore, in art alone that there is retained an ever-renewed presence (Dauer) of the already vanished, actual manifestation of God. 3. In so far, however, as in this manifestation emphasis is laid upon the fact that God is essentially an individual person, exclusive of any other, and is not merely the unity of divine and human subjectivity in general, but represents that unity in the form and person of this particular man (namely, Christ), in so far there appears in art, by reason of the con tent itself, all phases of the accidentality and particularity of finite existence, from which beauty at the height of the Classic ideal had purified itself. What the free comprehension of the beautiful had removed as incompatible with it, ? that is, the non-ideal, ? is here necessarily taken up and brought to view as a moment or element having its origin in the content it self. a. If, therefore, the person of Christ, as such, has been</page><page sequence="9">Hegel on Romantic Art. 121 frequently chosen as the object of representation, those ar tists have succeeded in the least degree who have attempted to make of Christ an ideal in the sense and in the mode of the Classic ideal. Such heads and forms of Christ may, indeed, show seriousness, calmness, and dignity; but, on the other hand, Christ must possess internality and absolutely universal spirituality; while, on the other hand, He must possess sub jective personality and individuality, and both these are irreconcilably opposed to felicity (Seligkeit) in the sensuous nature of the human form. To combine these two terms,? i. e., expression and form, ?is a task of the utmost difficulty ; so that painters have always fallen into embarrassment when ever they have departed from the traditional type. Serious ness and depth of consciousness, indeed, must be expressed in such heads ; but, on the one hand, the features and forms of the face and figure should just as little be of a merely ideal beauty as, on the other, they should be reduced to the merely common and ugly ; or, again, should be elevated to the merely sublime, as such. With respect to the external form, it is best to adopt the medium between the particular natural phase and ideal beauty. To attain precisely to this appropri ate medium is difficult, and hence it is especially in the choice which he here makes, that the ability, the fine sense, and spirit of the artist is displayed. For the most part, independent of the content which belongs to faith, we are, in the rep resentations of this entire circle, drawn (gewiesen) to the side of subjective activity more than was the case in the Classic Ideal. In Classic Art, the artist desires to represent the spiritual and divine immediately in the form of the cor poreal itself, in the organism of the human figure ; and the corporeal forms, in their modifications, which do away with the common and finite, furnish, therefore, the chief phase of interest. In our present circle the image remains common, familiar (bekannte); its forms are, to a certain extent, indiffer ent,? something particular, which may exist on this wise or on that, ?and in this respect may be handled with greater freedom. The predominant interest lies, therefore, on the one hand, in the form and method (Art und Weise) with which the artist</page><page sequence="10">122 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. causes (lasst) the spiritual and innermost nature, as this spirit ual being itself, to shine forth through this common and familiar form. On the other hand, it lies in the subjective execution, the technical means and skill through which he inspires his forms with spiritual life, and gives them the clear ness and comprehensibility of the spiritual. b. As to what concerns the further content: That lies, as wre have already seen, in the absolute history which has its origin in the conception of spirit itself, which renders objec tive the conversion of the corporeal and spiritual individuality in its essentiality and universality. For the reconciliation of the individual subjectivity with God does not appear immedi ately as harmony, but as harmony which proceeds originally from infinite pain, from resignation, from sacrifice, from de struction of the finite, both sensuous and subjective. The finite and the infinite are here combined in one; andt he reconcilia tion, in its true depth, internality, and power of mediation, shows itself only through the magnitude and harshness of the contradiction, which must find its solution. Hence, also, the unutterable poignancy (Scharfe) and dissonance of suffering, torment, anguish, to which this contradiction leads, belongs to the very nature of the spirit, whose absolute satisfaction here constitutes the content. This process of the spirit, taken in and for itself, is the essence, the central idea (Begriff) of spirit in general, and, therefore, acquires (enthalt) the characteristic of being, for consciousness, the universal history which must repeat itself, in each* and every individual consciousness. For conscious ness, as many individuals, is precisely the reality and existence of universal spirit. In the next place, however, since spirit has, as its essential moment or element, actuality in the indi vidual, this universal history presents itself only in the form of one individual to whom it is attributed, as belonging espe cially to Him, as the history of His birth, His life, death, and return from the grave; and yet in this individuality there is retained, at the same time, the significance of being the his tory of the universal, absolute Spirit itself. The special turning-point in this life of God is the abandon</page><page sequence="11">Hegel on Romantic Art. 123 ment of his individual existence as this man. It is the his tory of the passion, the sorrow on the cross, the Golgotha of the spirit, the pain of death. In so far, now, as there lies in the content itself the necessity that the external corporeal manifestation, ?the immediate existence as individual, ? shall appear in the pain of its negativity as the negative, in order that the spirit may reach its heaven through sacrificing sensu ous and subjective individuality to its (the spirit's) truth, in so far this sphere of representation is separated almost wholly from the classical plastic ideal. On the one hand, for exam ple, the earthly body and the infirmity of human nature gener ally is elevated and honored, since it is God himself who appears therein ; but, on the other hand, there is, first of all, this human and corporeal, which is posited as negative, and arrives at manifestation in its pain, while in the Classic ideal it did not lose the undisturbed harmony with the spiritual and substantial. Christ scourged, crowned with thorns, bearing his cross to the place of execution, raised upon the cross, expiring in the torture of his agonizing, protracted death,? all this is excluded from representation in accordance with the forms of Greek beauty; but in these situations there exists the higher quality of holiness in itself, the depth of the inner nature, the infinitude of suffering, as an eternal moment or element of the spirit, as endurance and divine tranquility. Respecting this form a further circle is constituted, ? partly by friends, partly by enemies. The friends themselves, in deed, are by no means ideal personages; but, in accordance with the conception, they are particular individuals, ordinary men drawn to Christ by the attraction of the spirit. The enemies, on the contrary, since they place themselves in oppo sition to God, condemn Him, mock, torture, and crucify Him, are represented as internally base ; and the representation of the inner malignity and hatred against God produces in the outward expression ferocity, rudeness, barbarity, rage, dis tortion of form. In all these respects deformity appears here as a necessary moment in contrast with Classic beauty. c. But in the divine nature the process of death is to be considered only as a point of transition, through which the</page><page sequence="12">124 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. reconciliation of the spirit with itself is brought to complete ness, and the two sides of the divine and the human, of the absolutely universal on the one hand and of phenomenal subjectivity on the other (and whose mediation is the thing of chief importance), combine into one affirmative totality. This affirmation, which is in general the foundation and origi nal element, must, therefore, give proof of itself in this posi tive way. Among the events in the life of Christ, those afford ing the most suitable subjects for the expression of this idea are the resurrection and ascension, apart from the moments in which he appears as teacher. Here, however, there arises the gravest difficulty, especially for the arts of visible repre sentation. For, in part, it is the spiritual, as such, which must attain to representation in its internality; in part, the Abso lute Spirit, which, in its infinitude and universality, affirma tively established in unity with subjectivity and elevated above immediate existence, must, nevertheless, still bring the whole expression of its infinitude and internality into view and sen suous realization (zur Anschaung und Auffindung) in the cor poreal and external. II. Religious Love. 1. Idea of the Absolute in Love.?2. Of Sentiment.?3. Love as Ideal of Ro mantic Art. Spirit in and for itself is not, as spirit, immediately an object of art. Its highest actual reconciliation in itself can only be a reconciliation and satisfaction in the spiritual, as such, which, in its pure ideal element, withdraws itself from artistic ex pression. For absolute truth stands on a higher level than that of the appearance (Schein) of the beautiful, which can not release itself from the ground of the sensuous and phe nomenal. If, however, spirit in its affirmative reconciliation acquires through art a spiritual existence, in which it is not only known as pure thought, as ideal, but can be felt and con templated, then there remains to us only the internality of the spirit, ? i. e., soul, sentiment, ? as the one only form which fulfils the double requirement of spirituality on the one side,</page><page sequence="13">Hegel on Romantic Art. 125 and of the possibility of being comprehended and represented by art, on the other. This internality, which alone corre sponds to the conception of the free spirit satisfied within itself, is Love. 1. In love,?that is, on the side of the content,?there are present those moments, or elements, which we have shown to constitute the fundamental conception of absolute spirit, which conception is that of the reconciled return of the spirit out of its other to itself. This other, again, as other, in which the spirit abides with itself, can only be spiritual, a spiritual personality. The true essence of love consists in this: that consciousness surrenders itself, forgets itself in an other self, and, nevertheless, through this very surrender and forgetfulness of self, attains for the first time to the full pos session of self. This mediation of the spirit with itself, and' the development thereof to a complete totality, is the Abso lute. And yet, doubtless, this is not to be taken in the sense ( Weise) that the Absolute, as merely singular, and, therefore, finite subjectivity, may recognize (zusammenschlosse) itself in another finite subject. Rather the content of subjectivity, securing in another its own mediation with itself, is here the Absolute itself; it is the spirit which, in another spirit, comes for the first time to be knowledge and will pertaining to itself as to the Absolute, and which has the satisfaction of this knowledge. 2. Now, more closely considered, this content, as love, has the form of sentiment concentrated within itself; which senti ment, instead of rendering its content explicit, ? instead of brino-inor it into consciousness, in accordance with its definite ness and universality, ?far rather collects the breadth and im measurable extent of the same within the simple depth of the soul, without unfolding to the imagination the wealth and variety of treasures which it contains within itself. Thus such content, which in its pure, spiritually characterized (aus geprdgten) universality, would be denied artistic representa tion, comes again, in this subjective existence as sentiment, to be within the range of art; for, on the one side, with the still undeveloped depth which constitutes the characteristic of the</page><page sequence="14">126 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. soul, there is no necessity compelling the development of this content to perfect clearness; while, on the other side, it se cures at the same time from this form an element which is appropriate to art. For soul, heart, sentiment, however spiritual and internal they may remain, nevertheless always have relation to the sensuous and corporeal, so that they are able to give indications of the innermost life and being of the spirit through the corporeal itself, through the look, through the features of the countenance, or, more spiritually still, through tone and word. But the external can appear here only so far as it is called upon to express the innermost nature itself in that phase of its internality which belongs to the soul, or sentiment. 3. If, now, we agree upon the reconciliation of the internal with its reality as the conception of the ideal, we can at the same time designate love as the ideal of Romantic art in its religious circle. It is spiritual beauty, as such. The Classic ideal also pointed out the mediation and reconciliation of the spirit with its other. But here the " other" of the spirit was the external form pervaded by the spirit itself, and constitut ing its corporeal organism. In love, on the contrary, the other of the spiritual is not the natural, but is itself a spirit ual consciousness, an other person (Subjekt), ? an "other" which spirit thus realizes for itself in its own realm, in its own most appropriate element. Thus love, in its affirmative satis faction and virtually (in sich) tranquilized, happy reality, is ideal, but at the same time absolutely spiritual beauty, which, by reason of its internality, can express itself only in the in ternality, and as the internality of the soul. For the spirit, which in spirit is present and immediately certain of itself, and thus has the spiritual as material and ground of its exist ence, is in itself internal, and, more precisely, is the inter nality of Love. a. God is love, and therefore, also, His deepest essence in this form appropriate to art is to be seized and represented in the person of Christ. But Christ is divine love. On the one hand, as the object of this love, he is God himself, considered as non-phenomenal essence; on the other, he manifests him</page><page sequence="15">Hegel on Romantic Art. 127 self to redeemed humanity, and thus the unfolding (Aufgehen) of one subject, or person, in a definite other subject, or per son, can by so much the less come to light in Him ; but rather there is made manifest the idea of love in its universality, ? the Absolute, the spirit of truth, in the element and in the form of sentiment. The expression of love, also, is generalized in proportion to the universality of its object, and in this ex pression, therefore, the subjective concentration of the heart and soul does not become the essential thing; just as, though in a wholly different relation, the general idea, and not the subjective side of the individual form and sentiment, was given an important significance among the Greeks in the an cient Titanic Eros and in Venus Urania. Only when, in the representations of Romantic Art, Christ is comprehended rather as at the same time an individual person, absorbed in himself, does the expression of love appear in the form of subjective internality, though, indeed, always elevated and supported by the universality of its content. b. But the subject most accessible and most favorable to religious Romantic phantasy is the love of the Virgin Mary, ? Maternal love. Eminently real, human, it is also wholly spir itual. It is disinterested, purified from all desire, is non-sen suous and yet present; it is internality absolutely satisfied and happy. It is a love without longing; and yet it is not friendship, for friendship, however deeply tender it may be, still demands a return, ? an essential object as ground of the friendly union. Maternal love, on the contrary, apart from any reference to ulterior aims or interests, possesses an immediate basis in the natural bond of connection between mother and child. Here, however, the love of the mother is limited just as little on the side of nature. In the child, whom she has borne beneath her heart, to whom in sorrow she has given birth, Mary possesses the complete knowledge and sentiment of herself. And this same child, the blood of her blood, stands, again, high above her; and yet this higher Being belongs to her, and is the object in which she forgets herself and likewise attains to her own complete being. The natural internality of maternal love is thoroughly</page><page sequence="16">128 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. spiritualized ; it has the divine for its peculiar content, but this divine quality remains latent (leise) and unknown, won drously interwoven with natural unity and human sensibility. It is blissful maternal love, and pertains only to this one mother, who is first and last in the possession of this happiness (in its full measure). This love is, indeed, not without grief, but the grief is only the sorrow of the loss, the mourning over the suffering, dying, dead son ; and, as we shall see at a later stage, does not pertain to injustice and torture inflicted from without j or to the endless conflict with sin, to the pain and torment of repentance and expiation. Such internality is here spiritual beauty; it is the ideal, the human identification of man with God, with the spirit, with truth; it is a pure forget fulness, a complete cancellation of self, and yet, in this for getfulness, it is thoroughly (von Hause aus) one with that in which it is merged, and this united being now realizes a bliss ful contentment. In such fine form does maternal love,?this image, as it were, of the spirit, ? enter into Romantic Art in place of the spirit itself, for it is possible for art to seize spirit only in the form of sentiment, and the sentiment of the union of the in dividual with God is present in the most original, most real, and most lively manner only In the maternal love of the Ma donna. It must, of necessity, enter into art if the ideal, the affirmative, satisfied reconciliation, is not to be wanting in the representations of this circle. There was, therefore, a time in which the maternal love of the Blessed Virgin pertained in general to the highest and holiest, and was venerated and rep resented as such. But when the spirit brings itself back into its own element, separated from all natural bases of senti ment, back to consciousness of itself, then spiritual mediation alone, free from such bases, must be considered as the open (freie) way to truth ; and hence, in Protestantism, in contrast with this Madonna-worship of art and faith, the Holy Ghost and the inner mediation of the spirit has come to be the higher truth. c. In the third place, finally, the affirmative reconciliation of the spirit appears as sentiment in the disciples of Christ,</page><page sequence="17">Hegel on Romantic Art. 129 in the women and friends who follow Him. These are for the most part characters who, in the hands of their divine Friend, have become penetrated by the rigor (Harte) of the idea of Christianity, and who, without having experienced the outer and inner torment of conversion, have become strengthened and enlightened through the friendship, the doctrine, and the exhortation of Christ. Thus they remain steadfast. From these, indeed, the immediate unity and internal quality of maternal love is, without doubt, quite separate; but the bond of unity is here also the presence of Christ, the custom of living in community, and the immediate attraction of spirit. III. The Spirit of the Church. 1. Martyrdom.?2. Repentance and Conversion. ? 3. Miracles and Legends. When we come to the transition into* a final sphere of this circle, we find that this can be joined on to what has already been said concerning the history of Christ. The immediate existence of Christ, as this individual man who is God, comes to be posited or assumed as cancelled. That is, in the mani festation of God as man, it becomes evident that the true reality of God is not immediate being, but rather that it is spirit. The reality of the Absolute as infinite subjectivity is only the spirit itself; God is present only in knowledge, in the element of the internal. This absolute existence of God, as no less ideal than subjective universality, does not, there fore, limit itself to this individual, who, in His history, has brought to light (zur Darstellung) the reconciliation of human with divine subjectivity, but extends itself to the human con sciousness reconciled with God; in general, to humanity y which exists as many individuals. For himself, however, taken as individual personality, man is doubtless not immedi ately divine. On the contrary, he is precisely the finite and human ; and the human only arrives at reconciliation with God in so far as it actually posits itself as negative, ? and, vir tually, it is negative, ? and thus cancels itself as the finite. It is through this deliverance from the imperfections of finitude that humanity for the first time comes to itself, or recognizes 9 * XIII?9</page><page sequence="18">130 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. itself (ergiebt sich), as the external and present existence of the Absolute Spirit; as the spirit of the Church, in which the union of the human with the divine spirit is completed within human actuality itself, as the real mediation of that which vir tually? that is, according to the idea of spirit ? is originally in unity. The principal forms which are to be considered of impor tance, with respect to this new content of Romantic Art, may be presented in the following divisions: The individual subject or person who, estranged from God, lives in sin and in the conflict of immediacy, and in the in completeness (Bedurftigkeit) of the finite, has the infinite destination of coming into reconciliation with itself and with God. But since, now, in the history of redemption through Christ, the negativity of immediate unity has proved to be the essential moment or element of the spirit, it becomes evident that the individual subject or person can elevate himself to freedom and peace in God only through the transformation of the natural and of finite personality. This elevation of finitude appears here under a threefold form. 1. First, as the external repetition of the history of the Passion, which presents itself under the form of actual bodily suffering,? as martyrdom. 2. Secondly, it is exhibited as a transformation produced in the inner nature of the soul, ? as internal mediation through awakening, repentance, and conversion. 3. Thirdly, and finally, the manifestation of God in earthly actuality is comprehended in such a way that the ordinary course of nature, and the natural form of other events, are cancelled, and the power and presence of the Divine become manifest; whence the miracle acquires the form of an actual occurrence. 1. Martyrs. ?The first manifestation in which the spirit of the Church proves itself to be actual in the human subject or person consists in this: That man reflects in himself the divine process, and reproduces the eternal history of God. Here, again, vanishes the expression of immediate affirmative ^</page><page sequence="19">Hegel on Romantic Art. 131 reconciliation, since now man must secure reconciliation through the cancellation of his finitude. Hence that which, at the first stage, constituted the central point, here appears in greatly enhanced proportions; for the destruction of the hypothesis of the inadequacy and unworthiness of humanity, now assumes importance as the highest and exclusive task. a. The peculiar content of this sphere is, therefore, the en durance of sufferings imposed by cruelty, as well as individual resignation, sacrifice, privation, self-imposed for the sake of being in want; for the sake of arousing every species of suf fering, agonies, and torments, that by this means the soul may become purified, and may feel itself to be at length whole, contented, and happy in its heaven. This negativity of pain becomes, in martyrdom, an end in itself, and the greatness of the glorification is measured by the dreadfulness of that which the man has suffered and the fearfulness of that which he has overcome. The first thing now which, in the uncompleted inner nature of the person, can be posited or assumed as neg ative in relation to his alienation from the world and to his sanctification, is his natural existence, his life, the satisfying of the primary necessities of existence. Bodily suffering, therefore, constitutes the principal object of this circle. In part, such suffering was imposed upon the faithful by enemies and persecutors of the faith through hate and desire for ven geance; in part, it was voluntarily assumed (vorgenommen), with a view to escape from individual inclination, through total abstraction. Here, in the fanaticism of endurance, man ac cepts both, not as injustice, but as blessing. For through suffering alone can the tyranny of the flesh ? esteemed as altogether sinful?be broken, the obduracy of the heart and the soul be subdued, and reconciliation with God be attained. In so far, however, as in such situations the conversion of the inner nature can be represented only in that which shocks us, and in the ill treatment (Mishandlung) of the external, in like degree is the sense of the beautiful likely to be perverted or destroyed. Hence the objects of this circle constitute a very dangerous material for art; for, on the one hand, the in dividuals must be represented as of a wholly other class than</page><page sequence="20">132 TJie Journal of Speculative Philosophy. was required in the history of the sufferings of Christ. They must be represented as actual, particular individuals, marked with the stamp of temporal existence, and in the infirmity of finitude and of the natural state. On the other hand, the torments and unheard-of atrocities, the destruction and dis location of limbs, bodily torments, the modes of execution,? such as decapitation, roasting over a slow fire, burning at the stake, boiling in oil, breaking upon the wheel, etc., ? all these are hideous, revolting, disgusting, external appearances whose separation from beauty is too great to admit of their being chosen by a sound art as the objects of its representations. The mode of treatment of the artist may, indeed, be excel lent, so far as the execution is concerned ; but the interest for this excellence is always related only to the subjective side, which, though it may seem to be in accordance with the rules of art, nevertheless struggles in vain to bring its material com pletely into harmony with itself. b. Hence the representation of this negative process de mands still another moment or element, which rises above this torment of body and soul and turns toward affirmative reconciliation. This is the reconciliation of the spirit in itself, which, as aim and result, has been attained through tor ments endured to the end. "In this sense, martyrs are the con servers of the divine, in opposition to the rudeness of ex ternal tyranny and the barbarity of unbelief. For the sake of the kingdom of heaven they endure pain and death ; and this courage, this strength, perseverance, and blessedness, must, in like degree, be manifest in them. Still, this internality of faith and of love, in its spiritual beauty, is by no means a spirit ual health, which gives perfect soundness to the body; it is rather an internality which has been thoroughly wrought upon by suffering, or which comes to light in the midst of sorrow, and which still contains within it, as something peculiarly essential, the moment or element of pain. Painting, espe cially, has frequently chosen such piety as the object of its representations. The chief task of painting, then, consists in the expression of the blessedness of the martyr in con trast with the revolting laceration of his flesh ; and this ex</page><page sequence="21">Hegel on Romantic Art. 133 pression must appear simply in the features of the counte nance,? in the look, etc., ? as resignation, as triumph over pain, as satisfaction in the attainment and increasing-realiza tion (Lebendigwerden) of the Divine Spirit in the inner being of the person. If, on the contrary, sculpture attempts to pre sent such content to view, it is found to be less suited to rep resent concentrated internality in this spiritualized way, and must, therefore, reject the painful, the distorted ( Verzerrte), in so far as this announces itself as developed in the corporeal organism. c. But, in the third place, the side of self-denial and en durance concerns, at this stage, not only natural existence and immediate finitude, but directs the aim of the soul to ward heaven, in a degree so extreme that the human and earthly, even when it is itself of a moral and rational type (Art), comes to be despised and rejected. Here, indeed, the idea of the conversion of the spirit is made vital and active by the spirit within itself; and the more uncultured the spirit is, only so much the more barbarously and abstractly does it turn itself with its concentrated force of piety against everything which, as finite, stands in opposition to this in-itself-simple infinitude of the religious sense ; against every particular sen timent of humanity; against the many-sided inclinations, relations, circumstances, and duties of the heart. For moral life in the family, the ties of friendship, of blood, of love, of the state, of vocation, ? all this pertains to the worldly ; and the worldly, in so far as it is here still unpervaded by the absolute conceptions of faith, and is not developed to unity and reconciliation with the same, appears to the abstract inter nality of the believing soul to be excluded from the circle of its sentiments and duties, and to stand in opposition thereto as something in itself nugatory, and, therefore, as hostile and hateful to piety. The moral organism of the human world, therefore, is not as yet respected, since the phases (Seiten) and duties thereof are not as yet recognized as necessary, authorized links in the chain of an actuality in itself rational, in which nothing can with impunity be elevated in one-sided fashion to an isolated independence, nor yet can it be sacri</page><page sequence="22">134 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. ficed, but must be retained as a valid moment or element. In this respect, religious reconciliation itself remains here merely abstract, and shows itself in the simple heart as an intensity of faith without extension, ? as the piety of the solitary soul which has not yet progressed to a universally developed con fidence in, and to an intelligent, comprehensive certainty of .itself. When, now, the force of such a soul places itself resolutely in opposition to worldliness, considered merely as negative, and forcibly separates itself from all human ties, though they be originally the strongest, it must be evident that this is a crudeness of spirit and a barbarous tyranny of abstraction which can only repel us. We would, therefore, in accordance with the standpoint of our present conscious ness, honor and revere the religious spirit (Reiigidsitat) in such representations ; but when piety proceeds so far that we see it wrought up to the point of violence against what is in itself rational and moral, we are no longer able to sympathize with such fanaticism of sanctity; but, on the contrary, this species of renunciation, so far as it repels from itself, destroys and crushes what is in and for itself justified and hallowed, must appear to us as immoral, and as contradicting the true religious spirit. Of this class are many legends, tales, and poems. For example, the story of a man who, full of love for his wife and family, and loved in return by all belonging to him, left his house, wandered about as a pilgrim, and, return ing at length in the disguise of a beggar, refrained from making himself known. Alms were given him, and, out of compassion, a small space was granted him under the stair way for his dwelling-place. Thus he lived for twenty years in his own house, beholding, the while, the sorrow of his family respecting himself, and only at last in his dying mo ments revealing himself to them. This monstrous caprice of fanaticism we are called upon to venerate as sanctity. Such persistence of renunciation may well remind us of the ex quisitencss of the torture to which the Hindu likewise freely submits himself for religious ends. Still, the endurance of the Hindu has an altogether different character. With that people, indeed, man puts himself into a state of obtuseness and</page><page sequence="23">Hegel on Romantic Art. 135 unconsciousness, while in our world it is pain, and purposed consciousness and keen sense (Empfindung) of pain that constitutes the precise aim ; for here it is by this means that greater purity is thought to be acquired; and the degree of the purity will, it is believed, be the greater the more closely the suffering is bound up with the consciousness of worth and of the love for renounced kindred, and with the constant view of the renunciation. The richer the heart is which imposes such proof upon itself, the more noble the possession which it bears within itself, and which it yet believes itself bound to condemn as nugatory, and to stamp as sinful, by so much the more cruel (desto harter) is the state of non-reconciliation, which may produce the most fearful convulsions and the wild est dissensions. According to our conception, such a soul,? which is at home in a visionary rather than in a real world, as such, and which, therefore, also feels itself lost in the sub stantially valid realms and aims of this definite actuality, and in spite of the fact that it is completely contained and in volved therein, still looks upon these customary affairs as negative in relation to its own absolute character (Bestim mung),? such a soul, in its self-imposed suffering no less than in its resignation, must appear to us insane; so that we can no more feel sympathy for it than we can bring about its elevation out of this state. Such deeds have no aim possess ing any further validity or content than what pertains exclu sively to the individual himself, separate and apart from all others. His only aim is to secure the salvation of his own soul, to make sure of his own happiness. But whether this particular one should be happy or not is a matter of concern to very few. 2. Repentance and Conversion. ? The opposite mode of representation in this sphere withdraws, on the one hand, from the external torment of the corporeal nature ; and, on the other, from the negative tendency against what is in itself jus tified in worldly actuality, and thus wins, in respect both to its content and its form, a basis commensurate with ideal art. This basis is the conversion of the internal nature, which is now expressed only in its spiritual pain, in the conversion</page><page sequence="24">136 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. of the soul. Thus, in the first place, the perpetual barbarity and frightfulness of the torment of the body falls into abey ance ; and, secondly, the barbarous phase of the religious sense of the soul no longer holds itself steadfastly in opposi tion to the customs of humanity, in order that it may, in the abstraction of its pure intellectual satisfaction, violently tread beneath its feet every other class of enjoyment in the sorrow of an absolute renunciation, but puts itself in opposition to that alone which in human nature is, in fact, sinful, criminal, base. It is a high assurance that faith ? that tendency of the spirit itself towards God ? is able to undo the accom plished deedTeven when it is sinful and criminal; to make of it something foreign to the individual, to wash it quite away. This withdrawal from the* evil, from the absolutely negative, which becomes actual in the individual after the subjective will and spirit, once become base, has now despised and destroyed itself; ? this return to the positive, which is now established as the only actual sphere in contradistinction to the earlier existence in sin, ? is the true infinite power of relig ious love, the presence and actuality of the absolute spirit in the individual itself. The feeling of the strength and persis tence of the individual spirit (which through God, to whom it turns, overcomes evil, and in so far as it mediates itself with Him, knows itself to be one with Him) gives, then, the satis faction and happiness of perceiving (anzuschanen) God as indeed absolute other, in contradistinction to sin and tempor ality, and yet of knowing this infinity at the same time as identical with me as this person, of bearing within myself this self-consciousness of God as my Ego, my self-consciousness, so certainly as 1 am myself. Such transformation ( Umkehr) takes place, it is true, wholly in the internal nature, and belongs, therefore, rather to religion than to art; while never theless it is the internality of the soul which, for the most part, seizes upon this act of conversion, and can also shine through the external, so that the art of visible representation-? painting ? acquires the right to make use in its representa tions of such process-of-conversion (Behehrungsgeschichte)* If, however, it represents completely all the particulars which</page><page sequence="25">Hegel on Romantic Art. 137 lie in such process-of-conversion, then many things which are ugly may enter along with them, for in this case the criminal and repulsive must also he set forth; as, for example, in the story of the Prodigal Son. Hence the most favorable condi tions for painting, in such case, will be to concentrate the con version alone upon a single figure (Bilde), without further de tails of criminality. Of this class is the Magdalene, which is to be numbered among the most beautiful objects in this circle, and which has, especially by Italian masters, been treated exquisitely and in strict accordance with art. She ap pears here both spiritually and physically as the beautiful sin ner, in whom sin and repentance are equally attractive. Still, neither in respect of sin nor of holiness is it then taken so seriously. To her much was forgiven (verziehen), for she loved much. For her love and her beauty she is forgiven (ist ihr verziehen), and the pathetic phase of it consists in this: that she makes an accusing conscience of her love, and lets fall tears of anguish in the beauty of a soul full of tender sensibility. Her error is not that she has loved so much-; but this is, if possible, her more beautiful and more touching error: that she should still believe herself to be a sinner; since now her highly sensitive beauty only presents the con ception that she has become noble and pure in her love. 3. Miracles and Legends. ?The last side, which is con nected with the two preceding, and which may be esteemed of importance in both, has reference to the miracle, which, in general, plays an important role in this entire circle. In this connection, we can point to the miracle as the process of con version of immediate natural existence. Actuality lies open to view as an ordinary accidental existence ; this finite being is in contact with the divine, which, in so far as it immediately concerns things wholly external and particular, casts them asunder, transforms them, and makes of them something wholly different, ? interrupts the natural course of things, as men are accustomed to say. Now, the soul, as amazed by such unnatural phenomena (in which it thinks to recognize the presence of the divine) and constrained to represent them in its finite imagination, constitutes one of the chief elements</page><page sequence="26">138 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. of many legends. In fact, however, the divine can affect and govern nature only as reason, as the unchangeable laws of nature itself which God has implanted therein, and the divine cannot permit itself to manifest itself immediately in particu lar circumstances and events which interrupt natural laws; for the eternal laws and properties (Bestimmungen) of reason alone pervade nature and operate therein. With respect to this side, legends frequently proceed without constraint (IsToth) into the abstruse, insipid, senseless, ridiculous, on the ground that spirit and soul must be moved to faith in the presence and actuality of God by what is in and for itself the irrational, false, and undivine. Emotion, piety, conversion can indeed, then, still be of interest, but it is only the one side ? the internal; so soon as it comes into relation with other and external objects, and this other comes to effect the conversion of the heart, then the external cannot be in itself something absurd and irrational. These may be considered the chief moments of the sub stantial content which, in this circle, is of importance as the nature of God, and as the process through which and in which it is spirit. It is the absolute object which art does not create snd reveal from and by itself, but which it has received from religion ; and, with the consciousness that this is the truth in and for itself, art now approaches it in order to express and represent it. It is the content of the believing, longing soul, which is itself potentially the infinite totality; so that now the external remains more or less external and indifferent, without coming into full harmony with the internal, and hence frequently develops into an adverse material not thoroughly within the grasp of art.</page></plain_text>
