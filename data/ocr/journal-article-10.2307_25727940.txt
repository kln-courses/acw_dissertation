<plain_text><page sequence="1">V ABSTRACTS OF ARTICLES Narrative, Intertext and Allusion in the Qur'anic Presentation of Job A. H. Johns Australian National University Job (Ayyub) is a byword for patience in the Islamic tradition, notwithstanding only six Qur'anic verses are devoted to him, four in Sad (vv.41-4), and two in al-Anbiya' (vv.83-4), and he is mentioned on only two other occasions, in al-Ancam (v.84) and al-Nisa' (v. 163). In relation to the space devoted to him, he could be accounted a iesser' prophet, nevertheless his significance in the Qur'an is unambiguous. The impact he makes is achieved in a number of ways. One is through the elaborate intertext transmitted from the Companions and Followers, and recorded in the exegetic tradition. Another is the way in which his role and charisma are highlighted by the prophets in whose company he is presented, and the shifting emphases of each of the suras in which he appears. Yet another is the wider context created by these suras in which key words and phrases actualize a complex network of echoes and resonances that elicit internal and trans sura associations focusing attention on him from various perspectives. The effectiveness of this presentation of him derives from the linguistic genius of the Qur'an which by this means triggers a vivid encounter with aspects of the rhythm of divine revelation no less direct than that of visual iconography in the Western Tradition. The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists: Theological Implications of the tawqif-istilah Antithesis and the majdz Controversy - Part I Mustafa Shah SOAS, University of London This article examines a number of issues relating to discussions of the origin of language and related topics among early Arabic linguists. A number of these discussions treated the topic of the 'revelationist' view of language (tawqif), and the opposing view that language had developed as a result of human convention (istilah). It has been suggested that religious doctrine hampered the development of the linguistic tradition, as theologically motivated views increasingly governed the way in which linguists were able to articulate their positions on this and related subjects. We contend that the evidence does not altogether support this view, and that there was a subtle interplay between theological views and linguistic theories. Individual linguists, whom tradition identifies as having certain theological tendencies, are found to have followed lines of linguistic thinking at odds with what is assumed to have been the religious doctrine to which they subscribed. An increasingly sophisticated tradition of scholarship refined and reassessed arguments based on the Qur'an and earlier thought, with a concern for the theological implications of issues such as ishtiqaq, tardduf and adddd. Vision and Ascension: Surat al-Najm and its Relation to Muhammad's micraj Josef van Ess Tubingen University In modern Muslim exegesis the two visions mentioned in the beginning of surat al-Najm are normally interpreted as events where the Prophet saw an angel, i.e., Gabriel who brought him his first message. However, the micraj stories which are found in hadith tend to incorporate them into their own context; here the visions are taken to allude to an audience the Prophet had with</page><page sequence="2">VI God after he had traversed the seven spheres where he met with his predecessors. Early commentators such as Ibn c Abbas assumed that Muhammad had seen God on this occasion. This, however, caused problems with regard to the tashblh (anthropomorphism) involved. The discussion seems to have started already in the generation of the sahaba. The 2in\\-tashbih faction got strong support from the Muctazilites, but also from Jahmites, Kharijites etc. In spite of this, the concept of mfrdj survived, although with some attenuation and in art rather than in theology proper. Muhkam and Mutashabih: An Analytical Study of al-Taban's and al-Zamakhshari's Interpretations of Q.3:7 Sahiron Syamsuddin McGill University and IAIN Sunan Kalijaga This essay is devoted to the study of al-Tabarl's and al-Zamakhshari's interpretations of Q.3:7. The problem of their exegetical methods, as a consequence of which they differ markedly in their findings, is a major concern herein. Using phenomenological, comparative and analytical approaches, we conclude that exegetical differences result from the methods they use and their sectarian tendencies. It is also emphasised that al-Tabarl and al-Zamakhshari fall victim to methodological inaccuracy and sectarian reductionism respectively. The Historical Geography of the Qur'an: A Study in asbdb al-nuzul Kenneth Cragg Our reading of the Qur'an is inevitably guided and informed by a sense of its 'timeless' and 'spaceless' nature - or, alternatively, of its being inextricably bound to seventh-century Arabia. We would argue that these two notions of the nature of the Qur'an are not necessarily opposed to each other. Indeed, if we take seriously the view that the Qur'an remains, in some sense, 'applicable', we need to look at how its precepts were interpreted to fit the changing circumstances of early Islam. Central to this interpretive effort is a radical rethinking of the concepts of asbdb al-nuzul and naskh. An assessment of the technological challenges and social realignments currently facing the Muslim world bring us to the conclusion that by broadening the concept of naskh in relation to the Qur'an, we would arrive at a more nuanced understanding of the Qur'an's timelessness. The Meaning of Revelation and the Interpretation of the Qur'an: A Qur'anic Perspective Abdullah Saeed University of Melbourne The majority of Muslims have held to the dictation theory of Revelation since the Qur'an was revealed fourteen hundred years ago. This article highlights a key aspect of current Qur'anic studies; that is, the rethinking of the genesis of Revelation, advocated by scholars like Kenneth Cragg, apparently as a prerequisite for reinterpretation of the text in the modern period. This article argues that such a rethinking of Revelation is not necessary, and that the avocation of the so-called 'human element' in the Qur'an is unwarranted. The argument is based on a literal reading of the Qur'anic text, on what it claims for itself, on key terms used in the Qur'an to describe itself, and on the understanding of the issue by Muslims from the earliest period to the present. In order to demonstrate this point, the article explores the pre-Islamic understanding of revelation, the relationship of revelation to language, and the Qur'anic texts dealing with the questions of 'authorship' of the Qur'an and of the Prophet's role therein. It argues that the</page><page sequence="3">VII reinterpretation of the Qur'an and the genesis and authorship of the text are two separate issues; and that reinterpretation does not depend on the identity of the Qur'an's author. The analysis indicates that the authorship of the Qur'an should be strictly assigned to Allah, and concludes that the arguments developed in favour of revision are not sustainable, at least from a Qur'anic perspective. Red Dots, Green Dots, Yellow Dots and Blue: Some Reflections on the Vocalisation of Early Qur'anic Manuscripts - Part I Yasin Dutton University of Edinburgh In this article, which is divided into Parts I and II, we consider the use of coloured dots - primarily red, green, yellow and blue - to indicate vocalisation in early Qur'anic manuscripts. Hitherto, Western scholars have been confused as to the purpose of these dots: from our researches it is clear that red dots indicate the main reading while dots of other colours illustrate various types of variant, including those which are shddhdh ('irregular'). In this article, we explore the types of variant indicated and their significance for an understanding of the history of the Qur'anic text. Part I consists of a survey of previous literature on this subject, from both European and Arabic sources. This is followed by a detailed examination of the types of variant revealed by fourteen out of twenty-one 'Kufic' manuscript fragments in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The remaining seven fragments are examined in Part II, which also includes an overall analysis of the different types of variant and a general appreciation of their broader significance. fa-qad saghat qulubukuma: The Interpretation of Qur'an 66:4 by Farahi and Islahi Mustansir Mir Youngstown State University The interpretation of Qur'an 66:4 relates to our understanding of events in the Prophet's household in the early Medinan period. Traditionally, exegetes have tended to interpret this verse as a reprimand to the wives of the Prophet, their interpretation resting on their understanding of the meaning of saghw. Two South Asian scholars of this century, cAbd al-Hamld al-Farahl and Amln Ahsan Islahi, have questioned this traditional interpretation. In their interpretation, they accord primacy to the Qur'anic text, reading this in the light of classical Arabic usage and attestations form jahili poetry. Their method of tafsir demonstrates both a concern for rigorous and philologically sound scholarship and an engagement with the emotional and psychological dimensions of this verse of the Qur'an. Ikhbat in the Qur'an: A Semantic Study Jasir Abu Safiyyeh University of Jordan This article aims to explore the meaning and Qur'anic usage of the term ikhbat and its cognates. Lexicographers have examined this word in some detail, and have arrived at definitions which we shall look at in the context of the Qur'an. Its status as technical term in the lexicon of Sufi practice is also taken into consideration. To arrive at a contextually appropriate definition of the word ikhbat, we need to appreciate how it is used in the Qur'an in conjunction with a number of</page><page sequence="4">VIII other terms. These terms display varying degrees of synonymy to ikhbdt, and this is brought out by the definitions traditionally given by Arabic philologists, which we suggest are rendered in English as follows; taqwa: Piety / Godliness wajal: Awe / a perceived fear of God khawf. Fear raja': Hope combined with a sense of anxiety and fear ishfdq: Solicitude / apprehension Accordingly, the mukhbitun are those who are humble before God; whose hearts are filled with awe when His name is mentioned, those who endure patiently and whose behaviour evinces taqwa. The fdsila in the Qur'an: Word, Context and Meaning Ahmad Mukhtar Omar University of Cairo Fdsila is a termed used to denote the last word in each Qur'anic dya. In this article, we explore this Qur'anic usage, examining in particular the connection between the choice of word, its semantic and rhythmic role in its immediate context, and its wider signification in the narrative. Previous writers on the subject drew attention to the apparent similarity between the fdsila and the rhythmic schemes of poetry and rhyming prose. We argue that the fdsila, while certainly playing a role in the rhythmic structure of the text, has a wider significance, and that an examination of each occurrence underlines the organic connection between the 'content' of each sentence and its fdsila. In a number of instances, it can be shown that the fdsila and the rhythmic and semantic demands of the narrative account for differences between standard usage and the Qur'anic text. We discuss a number of specific instances of fdsila, and, examine these in the light of the views of classical exegetes on this feature of the Qur'an. Grammatical Correctness and Stylistic Beauty in the Qur'an Tammam Hassan University of Cairo Arab grammarians sought to construct a system in which rules are universal. They relied on classification, observing conformity and difference in the language material they collected, and made conformity the basis of a given class, while disagreement distinguished one category from another. They thereby derived rules which they declared to be universal. When there were found to be restrictions on universality in a particular rule, they created a subsidiary rule, on condition that it did not entail ambiguity. However, conformity and similarity may result in multiple possibilities, which can in fact lead to ambiguity, while disagreement and difference provide distinct forms with unequivocal meanings. The grammarians had to discover indicators (qard 'in) that point to the appropriate grammatical function in every category. They were able to isolate the following: 1. Conjoining (tadamm) 2. Word Order (al-rutba), whether fixed or changeable</page><page sequence="5">IX 3. Connectivity (rabt), by co-referencing or by concordance 4. Inflection signs (calamdt al-frdb) 5. Morphological patterns (al-binya) 6. Particles (al-adawdt) 1. Context (al-siydq) It was in the light of all these, that grammarians ruled a structure to be correct or incorrect. Language, however, is much wider than grammar, and usage is not only concerned with grammatical correctness but also with stylistic considerations which can lead to departure from the grammatical rule, for instance by addition, omission, relaxation of the rule or metaphorical usage, and other features of stylistic boldness which challenge the universality of grammatical rules. The Qur'an was revealed 'in a clear Arabic tongue' before the existence of the study of grammar (nahw). It thus embodied the force of the language, which is shown in many types of departure from the normal rules for stylistic considerations. This article considers where the Qur'an stands with regard to grammatical correctness and stylistic beauty. The article explains that the assumed universality of the rules that grammarians needed for their system is much narrower than the rich usage of the Qur'an, which does not submit to strict universality or analogy. Grammarians themselves when faced with a usage that differed from their rules were forced to overlook these or resort to reinterpretation in order to maintain universality for their rules. Such differences from the rules are seen in three important areas: 1) Features such as omission, addition, preponderance, separation or parenthesis, which do not lead to ambiguity in the statement. 2) Subsidiary rules, many of which are listed in the article. 3) Making concession in the indicators of meaning when there was no fear of ambiguity (the article lists many examples for each indicator). Such explanations show grammar to be much narrower than the language because grammar concentrated, from the beginning, on what followed the rules and avoided listing features of stylistic boldness which belong to the aesthetic aspect of the text and hence do submit to general grammatical rules. It is not surprising that quarrels often occurred between grammarians and poets, where the grammarian was armed with his universal rules, and the poet retorted with his artistic freedom, saying, 'Our task is to say, and yours is to find suitable interpretations for what we say.' The article then goes on to trace elements of beauty in the Qur'anic style at the level of sounds and patterns and choices of words as well as through imagery, descriptions, etc. Under each of these the author examines many examples from the Qur'an to illustrate its stylistic beauty.</page></plain_text>
