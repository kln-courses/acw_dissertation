<plain_text><page sequence="1">RENEE RIESE HUBERT AND JUDD D. HUBERT Georges Perec's and Paolo Boni's Metaux Georges Perec became close friends with the Italian sculptor Paolo Boni and his American wife, the photographer Cuchi White, when they resided in the same neighborhood in Paris. They traveled to- gether in southern France and Italy. Perec collaborated with White on a limited edition book, Trompe l'oeil, and prefaced a volume of col- ored photographs entitled L'oeil ebloui. In Metaux, an artist's book of epic proportions published by the master printer Robert Dutrou, seven "sonnets heterogrammatiques" by Perec accompany Boni's "graphisculptures." An often-reproduced snapshot taken by White early in 1977 shows the three collaborators examining Metaux well on its way to completion.2 Unfortunately, the book did not appear un- til 1985, three years after Perec's death. While belonging in the "livres de peintres" category-limited editions featuring original graphics- Metaux displays the innovative qualities indispensable in artists' books where bookwork plays a preponderant part. In this respect, it 1. Born in Tuscany in 1926, Paolo Boni has had numerous one-person shows not only in France and Italy, but also in Canada and the United States, of his sculptures, paintings, and "graphisculptures," a technique he invented more than forty years ago. For Perec's relationship with Paolo Boni and Cuchi White and all aspects of his life and works see David Bellos's illuminating study Georges Perec. A Life in Words (Boston: Godine, 1993). Professor Bellos has suggested several subtle interpretations of Perec's poems in Metaux. White's photographs in the privately published Trompe 1'oeil (Paris: 1978) accompany Perec's homographic poems in which the same graphemes result in texts that make sense in both French and English without ever having the same meaning. Perec prefaced White's L'cil ebloui (Paris: Chene/Hachette, 1981). 2. Metaux consists of seven poems by Perec accompanied by seven colored and two uninked graphisculptures by Boni.

HUBERT continues a tradition that started with Sonia Delaunay and Blaise Cendrars's famous La prose du Transsiberien et de la petite Jehanne de France (1913).3 Metaux marks a radical departure from other artists' books. Boni's graphisculptures have little in common from the standpoint of tech- nique with Hungarian sculptor Etienne Hajdu's embossed but uninked plates that accompany Pierre Lecuire's Regnes or with surrealist Jacques Herold's numerous relief aquatints.4 In his youth, Boni had earned his living in metallurgy. Instead of working on rectangular cop- per sheets, he rivets various odd shaped metal plates, etches, inserts found objects and cliches, carefully inks them, and finally produces an embossed multicolored engraving. Instead of the rectangular frame of conventional engravings, we see, in relief, the margins of the irregu- larly shaped plates. We become aware of a constant interplay between the white paper and the invading or retreating colored imprint. As a re- sult, the graphisculptures can remind the viewer of Henry Moore's dy- namic use of negative space. In perfecting these unusual techniques, Boni became aware that the same ink produces different shades ac- cording to the metal selected. As a result, his low-relief sculptures pro- duce stunning painterly effects.5 Before composing the seven "heterogrammatic sonnets" that ac- company Boni's graphisculptures, Perec had published Alphabets, lim- iting himself to the ten most frequent letters in French-ESARTIN- ULO-to which he systematically added one of the remaining sixteen letters called "jokers," as in a card game-each one making its presence felt in exactly eleven of the 176 texts.6 The painter Felic Dado provided 3. Published by Blaise Cendrars in his privately owned tditions des Hommes Nou- veaux in 1913, this accordion fold volume that is two meters high has little in common with earlier "artist's books." See, in this connection, Yves Peyre, Peinture et poesie. Le dialogue par le livre (Paris: Gallimard, 2001); and Renee Riese and Judd D. Hubert, "La prose du Transsiberien et de la petite Jehanne de France" in The Dialogue between Paint- ing and Poetry, ed. Jean Khalfa (Cambridge: Black Apollo Press, Catalogue of the book exhibit at the Fitzwilliam Museum, 2001). 4. In Pierre Lecuire's Regnes (Paris: Lecuire, 1961), Hajdu limited himself to deep, uncolored embossing. Herold produced his brightly colored embossed aquatints from rectangular plates, for instance in Michel Butor's Dialogues des regnes (Paris: Brunidor, 1967). 5.

See, in this connection, WarrenMotte, "Clinamen Redux," ComparativeLiterature Studies 23/4 (1986): 263-81. 157</page><page sequence="3">158 Yale French Studies illustrations for Alphabets, but without bothering to study the poems, many of them decipherable.7 In Metaux, Perec followed a different but no less constraining for- mula. Each of the seven poems consists, like conventional sonnets, of fourteen lines. But as one would expect, adherence to tradition stops there, for each line invariably consists of fourteen letters (14 x 14 = 196 letters per poem). In order to prevent giant folio pages from overwhelm- ing these brief texts, Robert Dutrou printed them twice, first as small capitals forming an elegant square in the top left corner and then as a more readable free verse rendition in larger characters. At the bottom of each page, he noted in exiguous lettering the date and place of composi- tion of the poem. The restrictions chosen for the seven texts of Metaux resemble those of Alphabets. Twelve letters: the vowels a, e, i, o, u and seven consonants d, 1, m, n, r, s, t appear exactly fourteen times in each heterogrammatic sonnet. An additional letter-the joker-b, c, f, g, h, p, v, placed in alphabetical order, materializes fourteen times in a single poem. Featured in the only sonnet to which it lends its name, each of these letters emerges sporadically in the other six poems together with the rarely recurring letters j, q, x, y, z. Perhaps Perec's most difficult constraint consists in observing throughout the defining rule of the heterogram: he never repeats a letter in any of the ninety-eight lines of the seven poems. Moreover, he further reduced his choice by excluding k, the eleventh let- ter of the alphabet, and w, featured in the title of his W ou le souvenir d'enfance. Thanks to the exclusion of k, the w would have become the twenty-second letter in the alphabet. Bernard Magne has pointed out the function of k in several of Perec's works (65), and has shown the cru- cial importance for the author of 11 February 1943, the day the Nazis deported his mother to Auschwitz and the official date of her death.8 Thus, the exclusion of k and w reveals once again the orphaned writer's obsession with disappearance and absence particularly because the cir- cumstances and exact date of his mother's death remained a mystery. 7. Dado nonetheless produced innumerable drawings for Alphabets (Paris: Galilee, 1976). For the meanings of Perec's texts, see Mireille Ribiere's "Alphabets dechiffre," in Cahiers Georges Perec 5 (Paris: Editions du Limon, 1992). We have found her remarkable interpretive study of these anagrammatic poems most helpful. In "Quelques considera- tions sur les poemes h6terogrammatiques," also in Cahiers Georges Perec 5, Bernard Magne has provided indispensable commentaries on the technical aspects of these texts and shown how they relate to Perec's other works. He has also pointed out the connec- tion between words referring to metals and Boni's "metaux rives," 52. 8. In Georges Perec (Paris: Nathan, 1999), 65, Magne has also stressed Perec's fre- quent recourse to squares not only in his poetry but also in La vie mode d'emploi (75ff).</page><page sequence="4">RENtE REISE HUBERT AND JUDD D. HUBERT As though he had not imposed enough constraints, Perec added two more. All fourteen lines in the V poem start with the letter v while in the F sonnet the letters m and u cross the poem diagonally so as to form a large X or Saint Andrew's cross. Finally, he refrains from using the verb "to be." We have adopted the latter constraint, by far the easiest, in writing our essay. Unfortunately, we have had to limit ourselves to a tentative rather than an "Oulipian" translation of Perec's hermetic verse. The arduous constraints under which Perec labored create difficul- ties for readers eager to appreciate the poems. Indeed, the texts defi- nitely require collaboration on the part of consenting consumers. But before venturing into Perec's semantic minefields, we had better take into account the phonetic and typographical benefits of these restric- tions. By including fourteen times thirteen letters with their attendant sonorities in a 196-letter heterogrammmatic poem, the author in- evitably produces unusual sound effects. And it will hardly surprise anyone that Perec in relying chiefly on five vowels and seven conso- nants had knowledge of serial or twelve-tone music.9 His "sonnets heterogrammatiques" sound far less like Racine's flowing alexandrines than, let us say, Gerald Manley Hopkins's sprung rhythm. From a mu- sical standpoint, his verse shows far greater affinities with Alban Berg than with Lully. Not that all seven poems sound the same: the mul- tiple presence of the so-called joker letter-b, c, f, g, h, p, or v in a poem-does indeed give each text an individual sound track. In any case, constraints automatically assure the phonetic peculiarity and originality of each of the texts. Starting with the large red design decorating the front cover of the beige box in which he presented them, Robert Dutrou skillfully made the texts and their constraints not only legible but also visually com- pelling. The design's contorted shape prefigures the graphisculptures while functioning as a readable text by prominently displaying the six letters of the title: M-E-T-A-U-X, and the acute accent on the E. The same design reappears within a dry printed graphisculpture on the en- veloping cover page made of thick paper imitating the rough linen tex- ture of the box. Small capital letters disport themselves like dancers on a second dry printed graphisculpture. The reader soon realizes that these seventeen letters form a readable text: "pour accompagner... de," preceding "Sept sonnets heterogrammatiques de Georges Perec" 9. Magne, Georges Perec, 33-34. 159</page><page sequence="5">160 Yale French Studies and "Sept graphisculptures de Paolo Boni" printed at the top and bot- tom of the facing page. The dancing letters actually function as a preliminary to the aston- ishing typographical fireworks that follow. We see at first small black capital letters scattered all over the page and, in the middle, a large vi- olet capital B. On closer examination, we find that the seemingly dis- ordered letters obligingly fit into fourteen groups: fourteen as, ds, es, is, Is s, mss, os, rs, ss, and bs-the designated joker-and fourteen dis- parate letters. Close scrutiny reveals that Dutrou arranged the groups so as to repeat the first line of the poem. The large violet B foretells the dominant color of the graphisculpture on the facing page and even its shape. Moreover, the groups of surrounding letters, each one differing ever so slightly from the others, prefigure, but more vaguely than the featured B, the shape of the corresponding graphisculpture (Fig. 1). With C, F, G, H, P, and V, Dutrou repeats the same maneuver. In the F sec- tion, however, m and u replace their usual scattered formation with two diagonal lines while in the V section the v forms a straight verti- cal line. As though to increase the difficulty of his task, Dutrou printed the ms in violet, the us and vs in green. Clearly, the typographer did everything in his power to transform the text into a visual but none- theless readable artifact. In fact, he engineered the progression leading by stages from the twice-printed poem to the graphisculpture. Moving in the opposite direction, Boni included legible words and numbers in all but one of the seven colored plates. Perec's heterogrammatic sonnets lend themselves to interpretation more readily than the anagrammatic texts of Alphabets. Without ever becoming lyrical, they allude to the plates, referred to as "metaux rives," to writing, and to personal experiences. Metals of all sorts abound in the B poem: Instar du plomb et du bronze Sa limpide brulant somnambule tris d'oxydes laiton (brumes) angstr6m du billon stries du Cambrien Tombacs d'ultime jour dans blindages mort lubrique blond mastoc lambris net dur tocsin deambulant Rhum d'oeils</page><page sequence="6">RENEE REISE HUBERT AND JUDD D. HUBERT In keeping with lead and bronze its limpid burning sleep walker sorting oxides brass (mists) angstrom of copper coins Cambrian striae Armor plated tombacs of the ultimate day lewd death blond oaf spotless paneling tough sauntering tocsin Rhumb of typographical faces The sudden appearance of a Swedish name ("angstr6m") referring to sub- atomic measures produces a striking phonetic and semantic effect. A number of metals or metallic objects connect the text to the plates that Boni rivets together: "lead," "bronze," "billon," "tombacs," "armor plat- ing," "tocsin," "ceils," while "burning" refers to the heat generated in riveting or soldering and "oxides" to the chemistry involved in colored etchings. While this poem alludes more often and more directly to Boni's complex enterprise than do the following texts, it so happens that the artist has included in his first graphisculpture more found objects and readable cliches than elswehere in the book as though to reduce even fur- ther the gap between text and image. Of course, we can regard the metal- lic display in the initial poem as relevant to all seven of the colored im- ages. Both "stries" and "billon," an ambiguous word referring to "copper coins" and to "furrow," relate to the numerous scratches Boni has etched into the plates and the ridges produced by their overlapping. Finally, the typographical meaning of "oeils" hardly precludes an allusion to the small eye-shaped circles that decorate several of the engravings. The B poem and the accompanying graphisculpture interweave in more specific ways. As though generated by all the metals, chemicals, fire, subatomic physics, and disproportions such as "angstr6m du bil- lon," "stries du cambrien" and "rhum d'oeils," a diminished and some- what ridiculous human presence disports itself in the poem. The oxy- moron "mort lubrique," suggesting a debased love-death relationship, the oafish "blond mastoc," and the uncertain tread of "somnambule" sound a disparaging note consonant with base metals such as lead, brass, and copper coins. Manifested earlier in the poem by the pun on "tombacs" and "ultime jour," threatening death personified as a noisy and metallic "sauntering tocsin" mockingly performs a triumphant dance in this end of the world danse macabre. 161</page><page sequence="7">162 Yale French Studies Far more anthropomorphic than the following plates, the B graphi- sculpture evokes by its shape and violent colors an aggressive and de- fiant dancer bent on expressing hostility. More than in the following engravings, the colored plates give the distinct impression of invading the surrounding white space. The creature expresses mockery in every gesture as well as in the numerous readable cliches displayed in every part of its body. Nonetheless, this brightly colored graphisculpture im- presses the viewer with its Dionysian beauty. In the C poem, Perec continues to evoke Boni's technique not only by referring to metals and acids-"bitten"-but also to the wires embed- ded in the metal plates and creating linear networks in the engraving: Le zinc mordu sature climats d'onyx: Sacre du limon tamis lent du corps chemin du rat lorsque - dit-on - made du cristal n'ombre plus mica dont cobalt s'indure, modulant crispements: l'or du machicoulis d'argent mot arme d'un schlich solide murant Bitten zinc saturates onyx climates Alluvial anointment slow body sieve the rat's pathway when-they say-made of the crystal no longer shadows cobalt-hardening mica modulating crispations: the gold of silvered machicolation word armed with a slick solid walling In addition to several terms pertinent to engraving, Perec alludes to his own verbal performance: "they say" and "word" as well as to mu-</page><page sequence="8">RENEE REISE HUBERT AND JUDD D. HUBERT Figure 1. Paolo Boni, "Semi de lettres, B" sic: "modulating." By means of burial, death makes its presence felt in "alluvial annointment" and "slow body sieve." Imprisonment-"wall- ing"-adds to the negative impact of this poem in which onyx, mica, cobalt, gold, and silver scintillate in harmony with the bright colors of the corresponding graphisculpture. The expression "Sacre du limon" alludes also to the creation of Adam and to Prometheus's multifarious production of human beings while evoking the crowning of kings. In keeping with the idea of royalty, "machicolation" leads us back to the middle ages while emphasizing the verbal: "they say" transforms into a sort of Gothic novel, a fatal anointment combined with incarceration in the secret and rat-infested dungeons of a keep. Combined with this return to a distant past, the stress on chemistry and metals, particularly on gold, transforms the poem into a sort of verbal alchemy. The C poem develops even more intensely than the previous text the theme of death and a return to the past. Indeed, the B poem contained only one anti- quarian term: "tocsin," an archaic warning system. The accompanying image conveys a perhaps misleading sense of stability and calm.

Instead of invading the white paper, the self-containing colored section seems to float above it. Even though a peaceful harmony has replaced warring colors, an inescapable feeling of immobility and imprisonment hardly marks an improvement over the menacing gesture of the first engrav- ing. Fewer in number than in the previous image, the cliches have be- come more legible. Boni has added manuscript letters that blend in with the linear networks produced by wires. The resulting movement within the graphisculpture gives an impression of continuous creativ- ity. Finally, groups of exiguous xs or white crosses evoke at one and the same time a medieval coat of arms and a cemetery. All in all, Perec's poem has privileged the somber rather than the bright side of this Apol- lonian graphisculpture. In that outstanding modernist artist's book, La prose du transsiberien et de la petite Jehanne de France, Sonia Delau- nay had moved in the opposite direction by bringing out the sunny as- pects of Blaise Cendrars's consistently somber poem.10 As we have already noted, Perec's constraints peak in the F poem: Metal gris fondu ambre Flot si d'un simple rond tu affirmes vol du tant promis feu Landes film d'outrances Flot mu brin d'ail parfum dont s'eprend us a mi- flot L'an fait d'ombres refusant d'ombilic un flot drames hurlant defis mou frein d'Alsthom Gray melted metal amber Flow if from a simple rotundity you assert theft of the promised fire 10.

Paolo Boni, "Semi de lettres, C" moors film at bitter ends Flow in motion garlic shoot perfume infatuating usage in mid- flow The year flees shadows rejecting the umbillicus of a flow dramas shouting defiance Alsthom's false brake Perhaps because of the added restriction, this poem demands even greater efforts on the part of the reader than the preceding texts. In one way or another everything in this sonnet springs into movement as though influenced by the capital F that lets fly two arrows from its stand- ing position. The "gray metal" melts down; "Flow" flows along while directly referring to Prometheus' theft: "vol," which means both "theft" and "flight" takes wing; "fire" spreads; "moors" extend beyond the horizon; "film" turns and moves beyond; "perfume" evaporates; "the year" speeds toward the years ahead. At the end, "dramas" trans- 165</page><page sequence="11">166 Yale French Studies form this general flight into defiant shouts while "Alsthom," a giant corporation, attempts to slow down this irresistible rush so willingly accepted by humankind. Indeed, the affirmative "rotundity" rolls along with all the rest while shaping and formulating an approving OUI. This text in which metaphors of flowing predominate may very well refer to Perec's childhood when, fleeing the Nazis, he found relative safety in the Vercors region. In fact, the small lettering at the bottom of the pages indicates that he wrote the seven poems in conjunction with his return to Villard-de-Lans, the mountain village where he had spent his child- hood. Boni provides some confirmation of this interpretation by insert- ing in the corresponding graphisculpture two Petainist medals with the slogan: "Patrie, Travail, Famille," "Country, Work, Family." No less than the poem, the graphisculpture conveys, by its cen- trifugal movement, a need to escape. (Fig. 3) Instead of forming a cohe- sive mass as in the second engraving, the various plates seem to fly apart even though the artist must have riveted them together. Boni has inserted a number of round objects such as medals and coins. One of them contains a date, 1967, perhaps the source of the fleeting year in the poem. Provided we can trust our imagination, we can perceive in the engraving a lurking sea monster and birds of prey. But because that menacing green arch also looks like an innocent telephone, it can re- late to the commercial cliches clearly visible in the engraving and to the "Alsthom" corporation in the text. Moreover, the green arch adds circularity to the fleeting motion so prevalent in the engraving. Finally, the letters m and u forming an X meet in "mui," a word indicating move- ment while referring, like "angstrom," to a subatomic measure.' In- deed, science plays a part in this thoroughly "Oulipian" text. In the F and G poems, metals continue to interweave, though less conspicuously than before, in both the texts and the graphics. But in G, Perec introduces painting and, more indirectly, music in addition to us- ing terms relevant to writing: "mot" (word) and "pli" (fold), indicating the paper on which Dutrou printed both the texts and the graphics.

The poem might even provide an appreciation of Boni who from crudeness and a contorted "gangue" has fashioned a work of art. Conversely, a "gangue," such as a volcano or a carbuncle, can cause, if not death, an eruption of burning lava or flows of blood, tears, and pus- "half paste." On the side of hardness, we find "granite," the purifying "Mistral's frost" and Ingres, famous for the rigorous precision of his drawings and for his fiddling. Indeed, this violin-playing master relates directly to "modulating" and "String." Hard metal finally comes to grips with organic viscosity in "metal snout." The "so crude a world," "gan- gue," "Stromboli," "anthrax," "flask," and "dish" function as contain- ers ready to spew out their multifarious contents, including on rare occasions an artifact or a poem that has somehow escaped the general corruption. We can regard the text itself as a container yielding its con- strained meanings to the patient reader. The English word "String" re- quires special attention. In spite of all the containers, it probably has nothing to do with the material used in packaging even though Boni embeds metal strings into his plates. Rather, it refers to "string theory" in keeping with other terms borrowed from physics such as "ang- strom" and "mu." But because "string theory" derives its name from a comparison with the vibrating strings of a violin, Ingres's notori- ous violin becomes quite relevant. In any case, subatomic measures and the biological transformations of osmosis interweave metaphori- cally with the more subdued interrelationships of poetry, painting, and music. The poem may have derived its complexity and its intensity from the power and complicated structure of the accompanying graphis- culpture, the most spectacular in the book. (Fig. 4) Consisting of frag- ments of larger objects, the cliches fail to provide readable texts with the exception of part of a railroad timetable. As we have already noted, Perec wrote the poems in conjunction with his return to Villard-de-Lans and perhaps to commemorate the years he spent in this mountain retreat. Actually, he composed one of the sonnets on the train, no doubt on the capitalized "Mistral," functioning both as a powerful wind and peren- nially as one of the SNCF's crack performers. The Mistral stops at Va- lence where you have a connection to the Vercors. As David Bellos sug- gested to us in a conversation, the French railroad system emerges elsewhere in the texts, notably in "Alsthom," which supplies it with lo- comotives as well as brakes. And some of the lines in the engraving evoke a train in motion. More important still, the graphisculpture re-</page><page sequence="14">RENEE REISE HUBERT AND JUDD D. HUBERT Figure 4. Paolo Boni, "Semi de lettres, G" sembles a "gangue" whose contortion sets off an overwhelming array of shapes and colors. In short, it functions as a potentially explosive con- tainer, even though the plates, notably those in the dominant red color, show greater uniformity than in the preceding images. In the H poem, a legal terminology seemingly justifies drastic and definitive punishments: Droit Nuls machefers-lot humain d'un Mephisto lardant dol muri-sph6riques dont malheurs y liant d'hommes d'intox hurlant Mais le jourd'hui manchot les drachmes d'or un lit tres chaud, loin Morphines Talmud Trahison d'emplume hors l'indu bat 169</page><page sequence="15">170 Yale French Studies Law No clinkers-human lot of a Mephistopheles inflicting ripened fraud-spherical Whose misfortunes tying in men of shouting propaganda But the armless today gold drachmas a very hot bed, far off Morphine Talmud Betrayal of the feathered creature outside Unwonted drudgery By the inclusion of "gold," "drachmas," and "clinkers," metals con- tinue to play a major part in this poem. In addition, "drachmas," an- cient Greek coins featuring engraved effigies and words, relate to Dutrou's and Boni's crafts while metatextually involving writing, pre- sent also in "Talmud" and, somewhat derisively, in "feathered" ("em- plume"). The latter term can designate a writer holding a pen, a bird, for instance Prometheus's vulture, and "Mephisto," flying over Paris in Delacroix's famous lithograph. An opposition between fullness and lack also plays an important part as "Law," "ripened," and "spherical" give way to a truncated word: "intox" and to "armless." In the last line, the unwarranted imposition of "unwanted drudgery" contrasts with Perec's freely chosen constraints. We might also regard "Law" and "Talmud" as legal and religious curtailments of freedom. Goethe's and Delacroix's devil together with "a very hot bed, far off" suggest that tricksters, traitors, and perhaps even drug dealers might end up in Hell. But because "intox" (propaganda) has little to do with intoxication, while morphine induces sleep rather than hallucinations, belief in eter- nal retribution may arise from propaganda, from "intox." Similar in this respect to Goya's famous etching, "El Suenio de la razon produce monstros," this poem sounds like a wakeup call for humanity, victim- ized by religious restrictions of all descriptions and by various kinds of fraud. Perec, who often included English words in his texts, may have associated H with Hell. Because the corresponding graphisculpture appears more symmet-</page><page sequence="16">RENEE REISE HUBERT AND JUDD D. HUBERT Figure 5. Paolo Boni, "Semi de lettres, H" rically balanced than the others, Perec may have transformed "Droit" in the geometrical sense-meaning "straight"-into "Droit" in the le- gal meaning of the term ("Law"). (Fig. 5) Moreover, the various colored plates produce more decorative effects than usual. Toward the bottom of the page, we can see what looks very much like a stained glass win- dow in a Gothic church. Scrutinized from the right, this purportedly abstract engraving reveals the threatening presence of a devil. Surprisingly, the P poem does not contain any allusions to metals apart from the etymology of "surplombant," which means "overhang- ing" but whose root contains the word "plomb," "lead." This term might describe the position of an observer looking at a graphisculpture from above. Though attributed to Prometheus, "biting the white fold" applies more readily to his vulture. It also describes the various opera- tions required in preparing and printing a graphisculpture. Involve- ment with writing limits itself to a single term: "dits" ("sentences"), and music returns one again in "modulating." Nor has the author left out the idea of measuring: "empan" ("span"), a term as archaic as "machicoulis" and "tocsin." 1-1 -5 .1 ~ ~ ~ ::j: :: : I , , __ 171 -1 1</page><page sequence="17">172 Yale French Studies Larcin su dompte d'un sali Prometheus mordant pli blanc d'esprit mou defiant lors Puma, piment d'Horus (lard), felin somptueux: Sprint modal Humant d'espoir l'empan sorti du flanc trous de l'impavide mort plus ne surplombant dits du milan probe Theft well thwarted of a sullied Prometheus biting the white fold of a yielding mind then defying Puma, Horus' hot spice (bacon) sumptuous feline: Modal sprint Sniffing with hope the span removed from the side holes of fearless death no longer overhanging the honest kite's sentences Reversal characterizes this poem in which aggression, transgression, de- feat, and humiliation predominate. Prometheus, the persecuted Titan who had brought life and fire to humans, becomes "a sullied Pro- metheus," a thief who deserves the punishment inflicted by the gods, whereas his voracious vulture has metamorphosed into an "honest kite." Described as "fearless," death has usurped the role of hero, a role belong- ing by rights to an unsullied Prometheus. Transgressors such as the large felines and raptors who prey on and subdue others ironically function also as consumers of spicy food. And Horus, the sun god often represented as a falcon, joins forces with the honest kite. We may also detect irony in Perec's dwelling on, and exchanging roles with, Prometheus in several of the poems. He may have seen in this mythical figure a symbol of constraint, whether imposed by outside forces or freely chosen.</page><page sequence="18">RENEE REISE HUBERT AND JUDD D. HUBERT Figure 6.

(Fig. 6) Although the plates extend more than usual, their trompe l'oeil overlapping gives the impression that each one attempts to upstage the others. Far from creating anarchy and confusion, the artist has produced perfectly calculated entanglements where trompe l'oeil arises from systematic reversals between the metal matrix and the colored imprint. Toward the bottom of the graphisculpture, vague an- imal shapes may have suggested the felines in the poem. And we can identify an anthropomorphic and somewhat diabolical form at the top with a criminal Prometheus. In spite of all the usual constraints including the additional prob- lem of starting each line with the letter v, Perec succeeded in including an obvious pastiche of one of Mallarme's most famous lines from "Le vierge, le vivace et le bel aujourd'hui": "givrant d'oubli mes vols"- "frosting with oblivion my flights"-parodies "des vols qui n'ont pas fui" ["flights that did not take wing"] of the icebound swan. And he vastly increases the humor of his plagiarism by a play on words: "vol" once again means both flight and theft. 173</page><page sequence="19">174 Yale French Studies Vides (mot nul) Gravure (mots) Plan d'ivoire Lys d'un mat Vint l'arc des mouvances Mort du livide lu sombrant vers fil dont mauve satin mord glu vile Morts d'un havre quand mots livrent l'omis du javelot dans mur givrant d'oubli mes vols (brandi, muet) Voids (word of no account) Engraving (words) Ivory plan Lily of a mast Came the cry of motions Death of livid reading sinking toward the thread whose mauve satin bites base bird-lime Deaths of a harbor when words surrender the javelin's omission in a wall frosting with oblivion my flights (brandished, mute) The clever borrowing from Mallarme adds a final touch to a poem in which writing plays the major part: "mot" (word) appears three times and "lu" (read) completes the picture. In addition, "lily of a mast" and "ivory plan" may indicate the color and flatness of paper needed in printing words and images. As in the previous texts, we can discern a spotty narrative involving a maritime adventure, as suggested by the presence of a sail, a mast, and a harbor. And we cannot ignore the per- ils involved in sailing as expressed in the negative terms "nul," "livid," and especially "sinking." The mention of "arc," "javelin," and "bran- dished" seems to increase the danger. But because these medieval weapons, no less archaic than "mouvances," indicating feudal depen- dence while suggesting motion, function at present only in athletic events, we can dismiss these perils as illusory. And the "glu vile," in the sense of bird-lime rather than glue, threatens only small birds. But it may also entrap the poet by stopping his creative flow. Stressing the</page><page sequence="20">RENEE REISE HUBERT AND JUDD D. HUBERT 175 Figure 7. Paolo Boni, "Semi de lettres, V" opposition between creative intent and resulting sterility, "brandished, mute" in the final line repeats Mallarme's fear of failure. Perec's mas- terly irony may express in the guise of a sea voyage his failed attempts to recapture the past, a task made all the more difficult by self-imposed restrictions. And this poem contains even more terms indicating a lack than the preceding texts. According to Bernard Magne, these words correspond to missing letters in the alphabet. Moreover, Perec's inter- est in disappearances and voids has thus carried over from his novel La disparition. 12 The corresponding engraving features even greater luminosity than the poem that darkens toward the middle (Fig. 7). To catch the resem- blance between the green V and the image, we have to turn the en- graving upside down. Ironically, fertility appears everywhere, particu- larly in the oversized cliche resembling a cornucopia and advertising a variety of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products for a Nigois enterprise. 12. Magne sees a connection between these negative terms and Perec's use of a lacu- nary alphabet (Georges Perec, 36). The murder of "e" in La disparition (Paris: Denoel, 1969) encouraged Gilbert Adair to perpetrate a similar alphabetic assassination in A Void (London: Harvill Press, 1994), his translation of La disparition.</page><page sequence="21">176 Yale French Studies In the lower part of the engraving, a cartwheel that might serve to steer a boat alludes to abundant crops and to seafaring. Moreover, this graphi- sculpture may complete the dialogue by commemorating the time when the poet and the two artists vacationed together on the Riviera. In this way, the book ends on a happy note after a succession of en- counters with violence and death. Although the seven poems resemble one another phonetically be- cause of the constraints they share, the narratives they propose have little in common. They do form, however, a progression insofar as the emphasis on metals and on other aspects of Boni's accompaniment gives way to more literary and personal preoccupations. The fact that in all seven texts nouns far outstrip verbs results in an unusual num- ber of juxtapositions, many of them producing astonishing effects sim- ilar in some respects to those produced by Lautreamont's famous metaphor: "Beautiful as the chance encounter on a dissecting table of an umbrella and a sewing machine." Actually, we can define the strange verbal encounters in Perec as epiphors insofar as the juxtaposed concepts usually clash and thus induce the reader to discover or imag- ine suitable contexts. It will suffice to mention the following encoun- ters: "angstrom du billon," "Sacre du limon," "mou frein d'Alsthom," "metal groin," "jourd'hui manchot," "milan probe," "satin mord." The distances separating suddenly juxtaposed contexts set off verbal shock waves capable of increasing the violence evoked in the narra- tives. Abetted by the presence of death and a plethora of negatives, this violence might very well stem from Perec's frightening childhood ex- periences culminating in his mother's disappearance. The mad flight in the F poem and the Petain medals in the engraving confirm his pre- occupation with past events. Perec, however, involves more than his personal past insofar as myths, particularly the persecution of Pro- metheus, and references to the middle ages recur in the poems. Although all seven graphisculptures show the vertical uplift of monumental sculptures, they differ from one another by their coloring and especially by the harmonious or conflicting relationships among the dovetailing plates. In some of the engravings, anthropomorphism predominates while others resemble landscapes. At times, a cen- tripetal force gives a massive cohesion to the various parts while at oth- ers, a centrifugal movement sets off a helter-skelter flight. However greatly the imbrications of the plates vary from one engraving to the next, they always feature trompe l'oeil effects, particularly because, as viewers, we cannot easily determine how the plates overlay or under-</page><page sequence="22">RENEE REISE HUBERT AND JUDD D. HUBERT lie each other. Perec, who had written a long introduction to a book of trompe l'oeil photographs by Cuchi White, stresses Boni's use of this es- sential procedure in connection with an exhibition in Granada in April 1973, of the latter's paintings and engravings.13 While Perec and the other members of the Oulipo imposed restrictions on the writing of po- etry at a time when free verse and prose poems had replaced classical forms such as the sonnet, Boni and Dutrou greatly increased the diffi- culties of illustrating and printing books. A graphisculpture requires far more material effort and inventiveness on the part of an artist than etching or lithography. Boni gave up the traditional flatness of copper plates with their well defined margins in favor of a variety of unevenly surfaced metals riveted together to form a suitable matrix. And he had to insert all sorts of found objects, cliches, and wires in such a manner that they would enhance, rather than detract from, the engraving. With the help of embossing, he succeeded in transforming paper into low-re- lief sculpture. An artist who took such pains in obtaining results pre- viously considered impossible would fully appreciate Perec's strange search for the most arduous of constraints and engage with him in a productive adventure. 13. White, Boni, and Perec-notably in Un cabinet d'amateur (Paris: Balland, 1979)- share an uncommon interest in trompe l'oeil and other kinds of illusion. Perec prefaced an exhibition catalogue of Boni's works: Paolo Boni, Mecanico de lo imaginario (Granada: Banco di Granada, April, 1979) in which he insists on trompe l'eil in his friend's art. 177</page></plain_text>
