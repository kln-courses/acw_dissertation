<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL INSCRIPTION IN RENAISSANCE ART AND POLITICS Bartholomaeus Fontius: Liber monumentorum Romanae urbis et aliorum locorum By F. Saxl In these times of adversity and ill fortune, learned and honest men should not abandon hope that affairs . .. once settled and arms laid aside, . . . the Muses may again be revived and their strength restored. B. Fontius, Oratio in historiae laudationem. Modern epigraphy starts in the political sphere. Convoking the Roman people in S. Giovanni in Laterano, Cola di Rienzo displayed, read, and interpreted to his audience a great bronze inscription, the "Senatus Con- sultum de imperio Vespasiani." From it he drew the conclusion that in antiquity the Imperium proceeded from the People, who granted to the Monarch the use of supreme power. "Signori," he said, "such was the sove- reign power of the Roman people that it gave authority to the emperor," And he used to prophesy: "In a short time the Romans will return to their good old condition."' Cola devoted his life to the re-investment of the Roman people with such political power as they possessed in Vespasian's time. He and his followers were, however, soon made to realize that enthusiasm for the greatness of a nation's past alone does not produce any active political power. The humanists were no less impressed by those inscriptions that pro- claimed the might of the Roman Empire. Studying the monuments, however, not for ephemeral political purposes but with the intention of linking up life in all its aspects with the admired past, they began to preserve and copy them almost without discrimination. All their notions, divine and human, public and private, had their supposed model in classic antiquity, though they admitted that the ancients were very different from the moderns. They had a superior way of living, a superior style of learning and writing, different religious rites. Therefore hardly any inscription could exist which would not contain some good, useful and instructive maxim, or some piece of choice knowledge.2 It is often touching to observe how Greek and Latin epitaphs which originally had no more importance than those on an ordinary modern tombstone were being circulated and hailed among the humanists. Every inscription might one day yield a vital truth. It is not easy for us to understand such an attitude. Classical epigraphy has lost much of its glamour in our time. The many volumes of the Greek and I am very much indebted to Miss Frances A. Yates for improving upon my manuscript, and for rendering some of the Latin verses in English. 1 Hist. Rom. Fragm. (Muratori, Ant. It. III, cols. 405, 409). 2 Fra Giocondo expounds the idea of this difference, and affirms the necessity of col- lecting all inscriptions in the brilliant prefaces to his Sylloge.

SAXL Latin "Corpus Inscriptionum" stand on the shelves of every great library, their pages often uncut, in a place where they can hardly be used. Only specialists consult them. Fifty years ago the situation was different. Never before had there been an enthusiasm for classical inscriptions similar to that which prevailed in the days of Mommsen and de Rossi. Mommsen's mission was to reconstruct antique history on a documentary basis, stronger and more extensive than anybody had attempted to build up before him. This enabled him to write the history of Roman institutions in the same spirit as nowadays a history of the Civil Service in the last century might be written. It was to be a realistic history of the ancient world, no longer based on the description of single outstanding events and personalities. Classical antiquity became a normal part of our own past just as did the history of the Middle Ages through the Rolls Series and the Monumenta Germaniae. The price paid for this achieve- ment was the destruction of the classic ideal. Although some additions have been made to them in our time, these great collections remain more or less incomplete as the I9th century scholars left them. Neither are they used by a host of learned men, as their compilers expected. The impetus which created them has flagged. We are inclined to be satisfied with the results achieved by Mommsen's generation, and there is no vital urge to go beyond them in the field of Roman political history. In the recent "Mostra Augustea," held in Rome, epigraphy played a certain r61e comparable to that allotted to it by Cola di Rienzo, but this political revival foreshadowed the war, not the revival of epigraphic studies. The I9th century epigraphists based their work on the original stones, supplementing this material from the manuscripts of the humanists who preserved a great number of inscriptions which have since been lost. A magnificent organization for the study of these manuscripts was built up, every letter of the original texts was noted down-mostly before the modern im- provement of photography-the different versions were carefully compared with each other, great trouble was taken wherever possible to establish the original arrangement of the lines, and so on. It is, however, astonishing to realize how little interest 19th century philologists took in the personalities of their Renaissance predecessors. They mattered to them only in so far as they faithfully copied genuine classical texts. Why they copied the texts, what selections they made, what personal use they made of the material- these were no problems for the i9th century epigraphists. I think that a more psychological approach to the history of epigraphy is more in keeping with our general outlook, and that the result of such an attempt might yield a modest supplement to the achievements of 19th century scholarship. The Character of Fontius' Epigraphical Studies The occasion for this paper is a fragmentary manuscript in the possession of Professor Bernard Ashmole, which was bequeathed to the present owner by John Marshall and E. P. Warren. Professor Ashmole drew my attention to it, and kindly afforded every facility for my studies. The manuscript belongs to a group of Renaissance documents which have</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL INSCRIPTION IN RENAISSANCE ART AND POLITICS 21 been thoroughly investigated by Warburg and his predecessors, and which centre around the name of Francesco Sassetti. Few 15th century characters are better known than Francesco, since Warburg discovered his will and dis- cussed it in relation to his sepulchral chapel in S. Trinith and the Ghirlandaio frescoes which form part of it. Warburg's interpretation of a group of portraits on one of these frescoes-Francesco Sassetti and Lorenzo Medici are seen receiving the Medici children and their tutors-and his analysis of the decoration of Sassetti's tomb in relation to his will, rank among the most illuminating pieces of art history.' Warburg resuscitates the life of the "Consorteria" Sassetti, and analyses the various aspects of Francesco's character-the merchant and the humanist, the devout Catholic and the pagan scholar, the humble churchgoer and the magnificent donor-as these emerge in his struggle with the monks of Sta. Maria Novella for having removed the Sassetti coat of arms from the high altar, and in his subsequent choice of site and decoration for his tomb in Sta. Trinith. On fol. 55r of the Ashmole manuscript I found a marginal note: "This (inscription) I obtained from its own place when returning from Rome with Fr. Saxettus." On the back of the same page there is a similar remark: "I discovered this (inscription) when returning from Rome with Fr. Sassetti, alighted from my horse, and copied it." A later part of the manuscript contains Marsilio Ficino's letter addressed to Sassetti on the subject of "whom the wise consider to be happy" (fol. II9r). The author of our manuscript must therefore have been an intimate friend of Sassetti's, one of the humanists of Lorenzo Medici's entourage. The manuscript itself tells us his name: on fol. 159V is a famous letter from Bartholomaeus Fontius to Sassetti with author's corrections; on f. I66r are some inscriptions which the same Fontius is known to have collected in 1489 in Budapest. Sassetti's great-grandson mentions Fontius as one of his ancestor's learned friends. It was Fontius who reclaimed Sassetti's library for the heirs; and in his will Sassetti recommends that his children should have an epitaph arranged "come parra al Fontio o a qualche huomo docto intendente di simili cose."2 For Sassetti and his friends, Fontius was obviously the authority on inscriptions-modern and antique-and the Ashmole manuscript, although its first forty pages are missing, is the most important contribution of Fontius to epigraphy which has come down to us. There exist two similar epigraphic collections-one in Florence, the other in Siena-which are by Fontius or derived from him, but neither is as richly illustrated as ours.3 The manuscript opens in the middle of a sentence from an inscription of unusual length and kind.

Finis legis Servianae." Who are the people ordered by this law to exchange solemn promises at night, to mix their tears with their oaths, abandon shyness, fear and melancholy, and comply with the situation? Who is asked to use deceit, force, simulation as the opportunity demands? These injunctions, in the solemn wording of a genuine Roman law, are in fact precise prescriptions for the behaviour of lovers. The same text occurs in other Renaissance manuscripts with the title: "lex ex tabellis diuum de re futuaria" (CIL., VI, I7*). Bartholomaeus Fontius included remarkably few fakes in his collection. Perhaps he suspected the fake character of this one and wrote it down with his tongue in his cheek; but even then it may have seemed to him well worth copying, because in a way it may have embodied his idea of antiquity. On the one hand it acknowledges gaily love's mysteries and ap- proves of them as no Christian code could ever do; on the other hand the profane content is legitimized by the antique language, and by the very fact that the rules of sexual conduct are being presented in the solemnity of ancient legal terms. If Venus ever promulgated laws, their contents and their form might have been those of the inscription. Fontius was one of the least licentious of the humanists. Others invented shocking epitaphs'-he would not even copy such abominations. But he would enjoy including such an example of classic joy of living as Balnea, vina, Venus corrumpunt corpora nostra: Sed uitam faciunt Balnea, vina, Venus (CIL., VI, 15258) or a simple joke like the one which he borrowed from L. B. Alberti (CIL., VI, 20*). It is, however, the serious element which matters for Fontius. The manner in which the men of the Renaissance believed that their pagan fore- fathers confronted death is well expressed in a short dialogue preserved by Fontius and several other writers: Death is ineluctable, but there is no Hell or Heaven; we go into the Unknown.2 We visualize friends surrounding the deathbed, we listen to the farewell and to the answering words. When Riccio, a few decades later, represented the death of his learned friends he created a work of sculpture corresponding in sentiment to the scene enacted in this dialogue included by Fontius in his collection.3 Classical inscriptions reflect personal emotions with an intimacy hardly known to literary texts while still retaining dignity of form. Fontius copied, for instance, a dialogue between one Atimetus and his wife Homonaea (CIL., VI, 12652) upon whom, though not yet twenty years old, "envious fate laid its hand" (Iniecere manus inuida fata mihi). She mourns less for her own death than for her husband's grief. Atimetus begins the dialogue: "Sit tibit terra 1 E.g. CIL., VI, 43*, 47*- 2Apud veteres morientibus solemniter ab amicis dicebatur: "Vale, nos te ordine quo natura praemiserit cuncti sequemur." Re- sponsio: "Quo vadam nescio invitus morior: valete postumi." (CIL., II, 382*). The first formula is verbally taken from Servius, Comm. in Verg. Aen., III, 68. 3 Cf. Warburg Journal II, p. 358.</page><page sequence="5">THE CLASSICAL INSCRIPTION IN RENAISSANCE ART AND POLITICS 23 levis, mulier dignissima vita." He wishes to hasten away from the light of the sun, flee the gods and follow her to the nether regions. But she replies: "Tears are of no avail, neither are the Fates moved by them. We have lived our lives, and through this one door all must make their exit," and she ends by praying that the years of which death has deprived her may be added to the life of her husband.' I cannot go on quoting these texts, the spell of which acts on us as it did on the scholars of the I5th century who discovered and collected them, but I may be permitted to conclude this paragraph with the verses on the tomb of a child. How admirably erudite this child must have been, how wisely he despised life, how clear is his manner of addressing us: For twice five years, for two months and two days, Lived I on earth, nurtured with loving care. Pythagoras' lore I grasped, and wisdom rare, Learned poets' songs, and pondered Homer's pious lays .... Now I have fled this fevered world. Farewell Beauty and Hope! Others you may delude, I go beyond, where you no more intrude. Here's the eternal home; here I forever dwell.' The part played in the Renaissance by sepulchral poetry is well known. Fontius included a number of modern epitaphs, the best of which are perhaps Maffeo Vegio's verses on the tomb of the Patriarch of Constantinople who died in Florence after having achieved the union between the Greek and Roman Churches (fol. I26v ff.). The supreme example of this neo-classic style is, however, Donato Acciaiuolo's apostrophe of the Florentines on the occasion of Cosimo de'Medici's death and the inscription on the latter's sarcophagus, erected by Verrochio, which bears only the words: COSMVS MEDICES PVBLICO DECRETO PATER PATRIAE VIX. AN. LXXV. MENS. III. DIES XX. "The ancient monuments record," said Donato, "what gratitude is due to those who served their country well. Therefore you, Florentines, descend- ants of the Romans, should follow their example in respect of Cosimo de' Medici, who left behind an ardent and regretful longing for his authority and prudence. ... Thus let us call him pater patriae, and this illustrious name be written in golden letters that it may serve our sons as an example."3 1"Nil prosunt lacrimae nec possunt fata moveri: Viximus; hic omnis exitus unus habet." If we admire here the sweet melancholy of the expression, other epitaphs are moving by their emotional restraint. To quote an example from the next page (126v) of our manuscript: "Hospes, quod dico paulum est. Asta ac pellege. Hic est sepulcrum haud pulcrum pulcrae feminae: Nomen parentes nominarunt Claudiam: Suum maritum corde dilexit suo. Gnatos duos creauit: horum alterum in terra linquit, alium sub terra locat: Domum seruauit: lanam fecit: dixi. abi" (CIL., VI, I5346). 2Bis quinos annos, mensesque duos, duo soles In superos feci tenere nutritus amatus.

SAXL As in all similar collections the bulk of the epigraphic material contained in our manuscript consists of epitaphs. They extend from 500 B.c., from the age of Simonides to the time of the great author of Christian epigrams, Pope Damasus I, who lived in the second half of the 4th century A.D. They come from every corner of the ancient world, and are most varied in form-some are philosophic, some merely voluble, some quite simple and even of poor quality. Fontius and his contemporaries found them all worthy of preserva- tion and of study. It is at first sight a puzzling feature that, although the manuscript was carefully produced, no attempt was made at systematizing the inscriptions. They are arranged neither topographically nor according to their contents. Who ever had the book was supposed to read in it at random, enjoying one inscription after the other. Such an arrangement presupposes a class of readers equally interested in all manifestations of ancient life and capable of giving the single monument its proper place in the framework of their classical know- ledge. More than anything else it is this "disorder" which makes the modern reader realize how deeply interested the 15th century must have been in our subject. Another remarkable feature, and perhaps also an unexpected one, is presented by the fact that only a few inscriptions are of a sacred character. One could not learn much about pagan divinities and pagan liturgy from these monuments. An occasional dedication of a temple to Jupiter Paganicus is recorded (CIL., XI, 5375), some rarer divinities such as Apollo Vaticinator, Sabazius, Hercules Saxanus, Genius exercitus, Ysis and some others are mentioned, as is also the erection of Signa Castoris et Pollucis, or games in honour of Neptune-but obviously the study of Roman religion was of a lesser importance than other matters. Fontius does not seem to have been interested in its institutions, either to deprecate them as the Fathers of the Church had done, or to exalt them as did some of his neo-paganizing con- temporaries. The inscription GENIO EXERCITUS (CIL., VI, 234) will call up religious associations in the mind of a modern scholar but in the Renaissance view it belongs to a group of inscriptions which in number and importance ranks immediately after the epitaphs, if not before them. It consists of inscriptions giving evidence of the history of the Roman Empire, its rulers and "public" functionaries, its triumphs and public works. They exalt men's minds to the performance of great deeds, they kindle the desire for glory and immortality.' The ruins and remnants of the past remain dumb with- out their voice. After Fontius had visited Rome as a young man in 1472 he wrote an account of his impressions to Battista Guarino, and the letter Quattrocento, 1922, p. 212 f.; A. Segni, Vita di D. A., ed. Cav. T. Tonelli, I84i, p. 49.- Fontius did not insert the epitaph into our manuscript, but it is the only inscription which he quotes in his Annales (ed. J. Lamius in Phil. Villani, Liber de civ. Flor. famosis civ. Flor., I847), p. I55. S "praeclara sunt veterum monumenta virorumque nobilium praesertim animos ad res maximas gerendas et ad gloriae et im- mortalitatis studium vehementer accendunt," says Ciriaco; see Colucci, Ant. Pic., XV, p. XC. "quaeque potentum mentes sua pul- chritudine et bonitate excitare possent," says Fra Giocondo, op. cit., p. 40.</page><page sequence="7">THE CLASSICAL INSCRIPTION IN RENAISSANCE ART AND POLITICS 25 shows this very attitude. He says that for days he had considered with tears the vicissitudes of fortune, which had disfigured Rome so monstrously, and he sends his friend a list of the monuments which he most admired, each name being immediately followed by some words of the corresponding inscription. He had seen for example, the bridge over the Tiber "a L. Fabricio, C. filio, curatore viarum factum."' Walking among the Roman ruins he looks at them while reading and reads while looking. Our collection proves that his strong interest in historical inscriptions continued into his mature age. Beginning the study of this historical group with those inscriptions which deal with the great men of the Roman Republic, we come to the "Eulogy of Q. Fabius Maximus" (CIL., XI, 1828). This corresponds so closely to the Roman ideal as conceived by the humanists that it was at one time erroneously considered to be a Renaissance fake. "Dux aetatis suae cautissimus et rei militaris peritissimus habitus est" was thought to sound modern. And, though genuine itself, it was in fact from this epitaph that I5th century writers borrowed monumental expressions for their inventions.2 Not less grand is the Eulogy of Caius Marius,3 who ordered his foe Jugurta to walk before his triumphal car; or the record of Pompeius' deeds with its heroic exordium4 and triumphant chorus at the end.5 Awe-inspiring are the in- scriptions from the imperial urns: "Ossa Neronis Caesaris, Ossa Agrippinae, Ossa C. Caesaris Augusti F. Principis iuventutis" (CIL., VI, 884, 886 ff.). It hardly needs saying that Fontius included also the text of the bronze tablet which Rienzo had been the first to rediscover and interpret, defining the powers which Senate and people of Rome conferred upon the Emperor Vespasianus (CIL., VI, 930). This inscription is one of those which Fontius says that he had copied himself while staying in Rome, and the marginal note shows his special interest in it-an interest, though, of an academic character. Fontius was not one of those humanists who engaged in political struggle. He was an interested and correct observer of events, whether of past or con- temporary history, one who calendared them intelligently and dispas- sionately.6 In this spirit he studied the "Senatus Consultum de imperio Vespasiani." From here it is not far to look for the formulae expressive of political power. On the Beneventan arch the emperor Trajan is called "fortissimus princeps" (CIL., IX, 1558); of Tiberius it is said that he was born "ad aeternitatem I Barth. Fontius Epist. libri III, ed. L.

Morcellus, Op. epigr., I8I9, I, p. 265. 3 CIL., XI, 1831 and 1896: "Bellum cum Jugurta . . . gessit. eum cepit: triumphans ... ante currum suum duci iussit ... Teuto- norum exercitum delevit ...

A misreading shows that readers some- times desired to improve even on the powerful expressions which their ancestors had used. An inscription devoted to the Genius of the Roman army, which we have already mentioned, says that the troops satisfied Roman expectations by their faithful devotion. Our text, however, instead of "fideli devotione Romanae expectationi . . . satisfecit" reads "FIDE ET devotione ROMANA expectationi ... satisfecit," thus establishing a super-faith and a devotion which only a Roman soldier could possess (CIL., VI, 234)- The same trend of thought leads to the inscriptions pertaining to military and political triumphs, e.g. one recording the triumph of one Tiberius Plautius (74 A.D.) who transferred more than a hundred thousand unfortunate people from beyond the Danube with their wives, children and kings "ad praestanda tributa", to pay the tribute, and rendered a great many similar services to the empire (CIL., XIV, 3608). Intellectual triumphs are, however, also recorded, such as the coronation of a boy-poet, L. Valerius Pudens, upon whom this honour was unanimously conferred by the jury for his "claritas ingenii" at the sacred contest in honour of the Capitoline Jupiter (CIL., IX, 2860). In order to enrich the epigraphic material and to facilitate its interpreta- tion, Fontius added certain chapters from classical and modern authors. From Macrobius he included for instance the Senatus consultum about the renaming of the month Sextilis, which was henceforth to be called after the emperor Augustus. He inserted the dictionary of abbreviations by Val. Probus, added about twenty-five pages from Biondo's Topography of Ancient Rome, and Herodianus' brilliant description of the Apotheosis of Vespasianus. Finally he included the public works. Roman roads and bridges were still in use ; some of the temples still standing;"2 buildings like the Pantheon and Hadrian's tomb3 retained their sacred character; triumphal arches,4 walls and aqueducts,5 Cloacae and Thermae6 remained as the most massive remnants of the past; these works, created by the builders of the Roman Empire, much admired for their formal beauty, became historical documents of the first order through the inscriptions upon them. The only personal document contained in our manuscript which reveals the character of Fontius' scholarship is his letter to Francesco Sassetti about the opening of a tomb on the Via Appia in 1485, in which the well preserved body of a girl was found.' The "Conservatores Urbis" had it brought to their Palace, and all Rome went to see it; the Piazza del Campidoglio was crowded with pedlars as if there had been a fair. Fontius' report about the find shows a remarkable lack of humour. It begins in the real schoolmaster manner. Sassetti had questioned him on the subject. He was not only to be commended but even praised for taking so much interest in classical matters in spite of his many other occupations. Would that he, Fontius, might only be capable of describing the beauty and charm of the corpse! (P1. 5b).

The nose was so soft that if one pressed it with a finger one could bend it and it gave way. The arms could be moved in every direction, the fingers with nails still on them were so firm that they could not be torn from their joints. To sum up: "This maiden who had lived when Rome was flourishing was as shapely as she was noble." One sees Fontius standing there, as a humanist admiring the miraculously preserved remnants of a real being of the great past, as a pains- taking investigator experimenting to find out how far the state of good preservation of the corpse went. Enthusiasm is mingled with enlightened curiosity. We share the feelings of the pope who one night had the body removed to a secret place "fuori di Porta Salaria." The scene reminds one of a similar event which occurred in the following century. In 1599 the Cardinal of S. Cecilia discovered the well preserved body of the Saint, lying in the very position in which the Roman girl was found, "in faciem cubans." Again all Rome went to see the miraculous sight-but what a different meaning is attached to the two discoveries. S. Cecilia had suffered martyrdom for her faith, her body was preserved, not by the pagan art of embalming as the body of the Roman girl whom they found thickly covered with a fragrant substance, but by divine miracle. This miracle was a tangible proof of the orthodoxy of the Roman Church; it was understood as a promise of salvation for every faithful believer. The scent of pagan perfume filled the sarcophagus of the Roman maiden; the odour of sanctity exhaled from the body of S. Cecilia. This comparison makes it clear that though the pleasure of Fontius' discovery was largely intellectual, yet it was more than that. The event satisfied his emotional wants in a way comparable to the effects of the 1599 discovery on the community of the Counter-Reformation period. For a man like Fontius whose life from childhood onwards was devoted to the study of the classics, it must have been frightening and edifying to stand at the bier of one who had actually lived when Rome was great. The Programme of the Sassetti Tombs Warburg has shown how Fontius' contemporaries introduced pagan symbols into their Christian thought, and what an essential part these pagan symbols played in their mental outlook. There are some inscriptions on the tomb of Francesco Sassetti and of his wife, Nera Sassetti, which were almost certainly devised by Fontius for his friend, and are interesting in this connec- tion. Both sarcophagi have "Gen. Saxet. Fr.T.F." in large letters on the lids.2 The text on the front wall of Francesco's sarcophagus reads: DEO. OMNIP. FRANCISCUS SAXETTUS SIBI V.P.3 1 N. v. Hoist, "Die Caecilienstatue des Maderna," Ztschft. f. Kunstg. IV, I935, pp. 35-46. 2 The name of Francesco's father was Tommaso. 3 The other sarcophagus is inscribed "Deo. Omnip. Nerae Cursiae Conjug. dulciss. cum qua suaviter vivit Franciscus Saxettus Pos."</page><page sequence="10">28 F. SAXL Fontius' one departure from his pagan model, the somewhat indistinct "Deo omnipotenti" instead of the conventional beginning D.M., is the only Chris- tian element used in the dedication of the tomb. Above the tombs are four representations of imperial scenes with the correct inscriptions belonging to them, all four copied from Roman coins; over Nera's tomb are a Triumph and a Decursio, a military exercise executed at the funeral of an emperor (Nero); over Francesco's on the left two Caesares Augusti; on the right an Adlocutio scene, the emperor addressing his soldiers.' No detailed explanation of the bearing of these scenes on Francesco has ever been attempted, nor have I one to offer. This much may, however, be said: The tombs seem to have been conceived as triumphal arches, the scenes over the husband's tomb being those of an imperial vita activa, regarded as emblems of his own. It is in keeping with this style of thought that on the base Francesco caused the lamentation over his own death to be represented by a classical "conclamatio" and that he had his profile image on it made to resemble the imperial portrait on a coin. With regard to the triumph and funeral game scenes over Nera's tomb, the symbolism of such decorations is intelligible in the context of a metaphor which conceives of the conquest of the world by the merchant adventurer, in terms of the imperial inscriptions which Sassetti and Fontius collected.2 These representations seem to take the place of the elogia on the tombs of the heroes of antiquity which we found in our manuscript. The connection between Fontius as Sassetti's friend and adviser, and Fontius the author of our collection can be followed up further. Between the two sepulchres is the altar with the kneeling figures of the donors in frescoes on either side, and Ghirlandajo's famous panel, the Adoration of the Magi, stands on the altar. The procession of the Magi passes under a correctly designed triumphal arch with the inscription: "Gn. Pompeio Magno Hircanus Pont. P." (Pl. 6b) the supposition being that the Jewish High Priest Hircanus erected the monument in gratitude to Pompey, who after the conquest of Jerusalem reinstated him in his office. Josephus Flavius credits Pompey with such an interest in Judaism that he is said to have entered the Temple, penetrated into the Holy of Holies, but not to have touched any of its silver and gold vessels. These stories are meant to indicate the friendly submission ofJudaism to Rome. The Child whom the Magi approach lies in front of a sarcophagus bearing a prophetic inscription, again related to Pompey: Ense cadens Solymo Pompei Fulvius augur Numen, ait, quae me contigit urna dabit. An augur named Fulvius, a member of the forces which attacked Jerusalem under Pompey, was killed there. Dying, he prophesied that a new divinity would be born from the tomb which covered him. If the first inscription on the picture indicated the triumph of paganism over Judaism, the second signifies the victory of Christianity over the heathen world. 1 Warburg, op. cit., p. 157. 2 At the same time, puns on proper names are well known to have been fashionable in Renaissance society. Might the decursio of Nero contain an allusion to the name of Nera de' Cursis?</page><page sequence="11">THE CLASSICAL INSCRIPTION IN RENAISSANCE ART AND POLITICS 29 There is no doubt that the historical Hircanus never erected a triumphal arch for Pompey because the practice of erecting such arches had hardly begun in 63 B.c. Neither does the name of Fulvius occur in modern lists of Roman augurs. Both inscriptions were obviously invented by Fontius. That he was interested in "Magni Pompei gesta" is witnessed by our manuscript, which includes the great Elogium of Pompey taken from Pliny-though Fontius himself believed it to have been discovered in Latium in his own time, and incised on a marble tablet (CIL., VI, I* k). I do not know of any obvious connection between the history of Pompey and the coming of Christ, and it would therefore seem that Fontius' interest in the famous Roman caused him to invent the two inscriptions which, through the history of Pompey, inter- connect the history of the three great religions. This is the purpose of the classical details which form a strange contrast to the figures and the land- scape in Ghirlandajo's picture. Only the spectator who understands the meaning of the ruins, the sacred figures and those who surround them, grasps the full content of the miracle of the Nativity as Sassetti and Fontius conceived it. Fontius and Ciriaco d'Ancona Bartolomaeus Fontius, born in I445, was the pupil of Cristoforo Landino, and of the Greek Aristotelian scholar Argyropoulos. He was in contact with the leading personalities of his time. Borso d'Este received him kindly in Ferrara, where he established a lasting friendship with Battista Guarino. In his youth such a man as Politian could call him "animae . . . portio magna meae." He accompanied Donato Acciaiuoli, the Florentine chancellor, on a diplo- matic mission to France. Lorenzo Medici, Francesco Sassetti, Bernardo Ruccellai were his patrons. He educated the children of the Acciaiuoli, Pandolfini and Peruzzi. Marsilio Ficino had kind words of appreciation for him. He was on good terms with men like Pico della Mirandola and Pon- tanus. Twice he held the chair for eloquence in Florence; he was a professor in Rome for a time; Matthias Corvinus invited him to Budapest to enlist his help in planning the systematic arrangement of the royal library and future purchases for it; some of his editions had to be reprinted again and again.2 Yet in spite of these successes he evidently never rose above playing a some- what minor r6le. He was neither a Politian nor a Marsilio nor a Pico. He himself felt rather bitter about his time and his own existence. He enjoyed looking back to the generation that had gone before him, to the times of the great humanist Pope Nicholaus V, the times of Cosimo de'Medici and Alfonso d'Arragona. In those days, he says, great princes patronized great scholars like Biondo, Leonardo Bruni, Poggio, Leon Battista Alberti. But these patrons 1 At the Studio Fiorentino Fontius gave also a special course on Lucan's Pharsalia and Caesar's Civile Pompeianum, "auctores ad . . . magnarum rerum scientiam percipiendam utilissimi;" see his Orationes (s. 1. et a.): "Oratio in historiae laudationem." 2 Cf.

SAXL are dead and the flame of genius burns more faintly. The political situation is unfavourable to studies. Still he hopes for peace, either through victory or through exhaustion, so that studies may again flourish.' One sympathizes with Fontius, an honest, hard-working scholar with good philological training, a man of strict Christian principles and a sincere admirer of the classics. Although he possessed no creative powers, he vigorously carried on the tradi- tion set up by the older generation which he justly praises. Our manuscript shows Fontius as the champion of tradition. By far the greater part of the inscriptions which it contains had already been discovered and circulated by Ciriaco d'Ancona and his contemporaries. Not that he failed to improve the old readings to the best of his knowledge and to add new items to the old stock either through his own finds or by means of corres- pondence,2 but in realizing that the renaissance of antiquity should be based on epigraphy he was Ciriaco's heir. Mommsen appreciated and dis- liked Ciriaco heartily, and so might Fontius have done. Ciriaco was no scholar; he was a merchant and an adventurer who loved travelling, and who by doing business, originally as a sort of superior chartered accountant and political agent, had access to the major and minor rulers of the Near East. Expanding on the great past, he roused their interest in the monuments and inscriptions left by their ancestors. His letters are attractive to those who enjoy Renaissance enthusiasm, but hardly to good classical scholars like Fontius and Mommsen. His language is a barbarous mixture of Latin, some Greek, and Italian, a personal idiom created to give vent to his high spirits. Christian notions appear in it draped with a grotesque pagan cloak. If he wishes to tell his correspondent that he had a good journey from one of the Greek islands to another, or that he was given a nice farewell, he would express this simple fact by saying: "Faustum, Saturnalemque diem ex nobilissima Chio Samon, Ephesumque . . . petens, scapham ante diluculum, bonisque 1 Oratio in hist. laud.-Or. in Satyrae et studii humanitatis laud.-Annales suor. temp. ad annum 1465 (ed. Lamius, op. cit., p. 156). 2Fontius' sources cannot be properly in- vestigated unless access to the files of the CIL. in Berlin and to the original manu- scripts in Italian libraries is possible. The investigation ought to start from the Ash- burnham and Siena MSS. (in which at least 80 inscriptions of our collection also occur), as these Fontius MSS. are complete where ours is a fragment.-Fontius mentions Ciriaco as his source on fols. 44r, 59v, 6or, 72v, 73r; the drawings from Greece on folio I32v f. are certainly copied from Ciriaco's. But a much larger part of Fontius' collection contains what are undoubtedly Ciriacana (see CIL., IX, p. XXXVII). For example fols. 42r-43v of our mansucript appear in the same order in the famous Parm.; the group on fols. 46r- 50v of our MS. is closely related to that of fols. 17-23 of the Neapol., etc.-Fontius re- ceived a certain number of inscriptions by correspondence through Francesco Sassetti's and Donato Acciaiuolo's friends (XIV, 361o; VI, 26192; XI, I323, 1750, I737). He ob- tained VI, 9693 from one of his own friends who was connected with P. Laetus. The Pesaro group (f. Io8v- i Iv, I2ov) goes back to Pandolfo Colenuccio's collectanea (see R. Sabbadini, "Classici e Umanisti," Fontes Ambr. II, 1933, P- 38 f.). Cosimo Sassetti may have been his informant for the inscriptions from Lyons and Nimes which are not con- tained in earlier collections (XII, 3201, 3850; XIII, I676a, b, 2161, I940, 2270, 2178), since we know that Fontius, on his side, tried to provide Sassetti with antique "medals" from Rome (Marchesi, op. cit., p. 193 f.). Fon- tius seems to have copied the following inscrip- tions himself: III, 3583 (?); 3706 (?), 6265, I460, 7979; VI, 896, 930; XI, 1554 (?), 1593, 5375, 5391, 4090, 3396, 3454, 3431, 3490.</page><page sequence="13">THE CLASSICAL INSCRIPTION IN RENAISSANCE ART AND POLITICS 31 avibus conscendi ... et exeuntes e portu ... Diva Calliope Coniux brevem hanc Divis lepido idiomate nostro orationem sanctissimo ab ore protuberat. Nymphae Chienses," etc.' Fontius was as far from copying such letters as were the authors of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum. What he (and they) copied were the inscrip- tions inserted between the extraordinary descriptions and phrases. The result thus achieved by Fontius is a little dry. Abhorring and avoiding both bad Latin and any appearance of enthusiasm he pruned away all the wild orna- ments. Though sound, his collection does not introduce any new principle, and does not, therefore, open up new avenues of thought as did Ciriaco's eccentric letters. It was again left to one who was not a specialist in the subject to give epigraphy a new start. Fra Giocondo, a man of Fontius' own sphere, was a famous engineer and architect. He built bridges in Paris and Venice, took over with Raphael the fabbrica of S. Peter's after the death of Bramante, edited Vitruvius and Frontinus with Aldus, travelled a great deal, and copied inscriptions from stones and from the collectanea of other scholars. He employed three new principles: (I) to separate critically inscriptions based on examination at first hand from those known to him by hearsay; (2) to make the collection as comprehensive as possible, a "Corpus," and (3) to arrange it topographically--the same principles as those on which Mommsen based the final achievement.2 Fontius is neither enthusiastic and prolific like Ciriaco nor the founder of a nova scientia like Fra Giocondo; he stands between the two greater men, making a careful but unorganized selection from the work of his predecessors, and adding some new and accurately copied material to it. The rather too pronounced taste for the former generation manifests itself in the choice of those modern epitaphs which he included in the manu- script. These recall historical events of the thirties and forties, e.g., the Florentine Council (126v). They praise and blame people who died long ago, such as the mother of Nicolaus V, Ciriaco's patron-friend (II6r sq.), Carlo Aretino (i29v), Braccio Sforza (128v), Neri di Gino Capponi (I29r), Pio II (131 r, v.), Niccolo Niccoli (I30ov), Lorenzo Valla (129r) ; and those who com- posed the epitaphs were also dead or old men like Leonardo Bruni (i29v), Maffeo Vegio (124r, 126v, I3ov), Filelfo (13Ir) or Bartolomeo della Scala (73v): Pugnabant pulchra pro maiestate parentes, Stat modo venali milite nostra salus.S x Then follows a poetic prayer to the Nymphae Chienses, the Nereides, Amphi- trite, Galatea, Lotho, Glaucus, Panopea, etc. Comment.

SAXL Classical Monuments in Ciriaco's Drawings and in Renaissance Sculpture Ciriaco's manuscripts were freely illustrated with drawings after classical monuments. A few copies from these drawings were up to now known to exist, the most important being those in the famous book of drawings by the same Sangallo who designed the Sassetti tomb.' Fontius' manuscript contains a hitherto hardly known group of other Ciriaco drawings. By far the most valuable are those on fol. I32v-I36r, consisting of eight partly 'measured' drawings from Hadrian's temple in Cyzicus which Ciriaco had seen standing intact in 1431, and which he found destroyed in 1444.2 Ciriaco tried to prevent further destruction. When he visited the Turkish regent Canuzabegh, a man of Greek extraction and education, he obtained from him the promise no more to allow the ruins to be used as building materials.3 In Florence he saw the doyen of scholars, Niccolo Niccoli, who was delighted to hear Ciriaco's description of Cyzicus and also, we may assume, to see the drawings which he produced.4 No wonder that Fontius was eager to have these drawings copied; and, since Ciriaco's efforts to save what was still left in 1444 remained in- effective, the drawings in our manuscript are to-day the only record of what had once been one of the seven wonders of the world.5 The selection of subjects dominating the rest of the drawings is strange. Not one of the Olympians is reproduced, no sarcophagus, no pediment sculpture: instead we find a relief belonging to an unknown mystery cult, with snakes and a charioteer (P1. 5d); a divinity of Nature, Pan, with his animals (P1. 9a); two representations of the Medusa, one on a capital (Pl. 8a), one in bronze (P1. 8d); the nine Muses, patrons of the arts (P1. 7a) ; an allegory of Consilium ("Hiera Boule," Pl. 8b) ; a portrait of Aristotle, the philosopher kat'exochen (P1. 6d); a sacrifice to Jupiter (P1. 9c); and a reconstruction of the greatest imperial tomb on Roman soil, the Moles Hadriani (P1. 5a). With the subjects arranged in this order, the lines of a humanistic programme become visible in what seemed at first sight an arbitrary choice. What fascinated Renaissance classicists was Roman history, the goddesses, allegories, and personalities representative of the achievements of the human mind, the symbols of fertility and the forces of nature, and finally the cults and the monuments to the dead. It may seem 1 The subject of Ciriaco's drawings has not yet been properly dealt with. The material has been collected by de Rossi, op. cit., p. 381 f., Chr. Huilsen, II libro di Giuliano da Sangallo (Codd. e Vat. sel. XI, I9I0, p. 36 f.) ; and idem, La Roma antica di Ciriaco d'Ancona, 1907, P- 7 f. Ciriaco was undoubtedly a gifted draughtsman, compare e.g. f. 29 of the Cod. Barberini with the original now in the British Museum (Ath. Mitt. XIII, I888, pl. VIII). His contemporaries evidently thought the same; see G. Colucci, Delle Antichita Picene XV, 1792, P. XLIV f.

There is not only the Gorgo which stands for the threatening forces of Nature but also a Scylla,' and Eagle and Snake2; not only Pan for Nature's bounty but also Venus, Neptune, Bacchus, the Nereids, sea-monsters and winds3; not only Aristotle for the rational aspect of life but also the Muses and Apollo, and Mercury, Arion and Virgil.' Ancient history is represented by statues of Lycurgus, of the great Scipio and of Augustus, an image of Scipio Junior and C. Marius, several equestrian statues, coins of Philippus, Alexander and Lysimachus, of Trajan and Vespasian, the monument for Philopappos standing on a triumphal car,5 tomb slabs (there is one with the portraits of a man and his wife, one with a representation of bacchanals, and several with farewell scenes6)-but all these subjects are within the same framework as that which also comprised Fontius' world of images. This correspondence is so close that Fontius' omission of the kind of heroes of whom Ciriaco was fond-Achilles, Heracles, Castor and Pollux-might even be taken as throw- ing light on his character.' Perhaps they did not appeal to the mind of a scholar who disliked war as Fontius did. But their grandeur certainly appealed to many humanists and artists of his generation. If there is no doubt as to the taste governing the choice of subjects which Fontius had copied from Ciriaco's manuscripts, some of the captions are more difficult to understand, notably those under the drawings representing the "Muses" and the portrait of "Aristotle." On f. I38v the "Muses" are merely called Al ThN 2AMOOPAK(NN N rMWAI and the single figures on this page are not named; whereas on the two preceding pages which make up the relief the name of a Muse appears over each of the figures. The Greek original reproduced on these three pages after Ciriaco is to-day in the Louvre, and there is no doubt that the figures do not represent the Muses, for the simple reason that there are more than nine dancers (P1. 7b)8. In fact there are ten even in our manuscript, and they could only be called "Muses" if the tenth figure with a tambourine were assumed to be a musician accompanying them. 1 Olivieri, op. cit., p. 37, n. 202, p. 54, n. 305; G.

In the imagination of the humanists the Muses were dancing figures, not quietly standing as we know them from Roman sar- cophagi. The desire to find a Greek original which conformed to the 'right' idea was the father of an archaeological error. The case of the Aristotle portrait is similar. Its authenticity was un- disputed until modern archaeologists challenged its classical origin and even went so far as to take it for an idealized portrait of one of the graeculi teaching Greek in Italy after the fall of Constantinople, perhaps of Fontius' master, the Aristotelian Argyropoulos. This theory, however, is improbable.' Our drawing forms part of a series brought back from Greece by Ciriaco, and is closely connected in style with Greek portrait busts with diadems such as the British Museum Sophocles (P1. 6e). Again we do not know if it was Ciriaco who added the 'modern' cap and the pseudo-antique dress, but it is very likely that he himself should have called the bust Aristotle. His mistake was so plausible that it deceived ten generations of scholars. The style of the originals underwent an 'interpretation' similar to that of the subjects.2 The Pan relief from Thasos is still on the spot where Ciriaco saw it (P1. 9b).3 But while the forms are reproduced more or less accurately, he introduced an effect of increased awareness into his drawing. Pan seems to be very pleased with himself; one of the animals listens to his music; the other sniffs the air. The original of the "Hiera Boule" is unknown; but it is easy to see that, in the copy after Ciriaco, body and dress are intelligently rendered, whereas movement and expression of the face, with eyes turned aside and framed by disorderly ringlets of hair, are stronger than those of any Greek original could have been.4 The same tendency, even more pronounced, is manifest in the head of the Medusa and in the "Muses." In the original, the figure of the Medusa was clothed in scale-armour from which the neck emerged, clearly separated from the armour, and the head was framed by crisp curls of hair and snakes (Pl. 8c).5 In our drawing a mass of 'romantic' shapes surrounds the face; our eye is not meant to wander from one detail to another, it is meant to dwell spell-bound on the mysterious and terrifying aspect of the monster concentrated in the expression of the dark eyes. It is un- reasonable to assume that Ciriaco was a bad draughtsman, and therefore 'bungled' the originals. On the contrary, even a second-hand copy like ours of his Medusa drawing preserves the original to the extent that its type can easily be recognized. He saw the originals in conformity with his own conception of their significance. Finally there are the Muses. The drawing carefully renders the arrange- ment of the dance, and certain details such as the looking backwards of some of the figures, the movements of their arms, even the folds of the drapery, are true to the original (P1. 7a, b). Yet in spite of this accuracy in detail the render- 1 Cf. Description below, fol.

The dance rhythm has lost its archaic rigidity, the figures are more plastic, more animated, have nothing of their pseudo-archaic elegance, the frame is omitted, so that they stand before an empty, undefined background, their faces-and in the face, the eyes-are of greater psychological importance than on the sculpture. Ciriaco and his followers translated the specific idiom of the original into one which had a more agitated rhythm and better means of expressing the psychological nuance. The meaning which Pan, Medusa and the Muses had for those Christian souls, and which is different from what they had meant to their pagan forefathers, slips into their reproductions even if made for what we would call archaeological purposes. The matter has been treated here at greater length because there are so few facts available with regard to the Renaissance attitude towards Greek art. In I437 Ciriaco paid a visit to the studios of both Donatello and Ghiberti where he saw works of ancient art. In Ghiberti's house he was certainly shown the famous Letto di Policleto and the big Greek marble vase.' Years ago I pointed out that Ciriaco's drawing of an archaic Hermes had a wide circulation, and was often copied in Italy and in the North-but this was obviously due to the fact that Ciriaco considered Mercurius to be his patron saint, and sent the drawing to all his friends.2 Florence on the whole was too Latin for her artists to have taken a special interest in Greek art as apart from classical art in general. We may find an occasional copy of a gem, the design of which is based on an archaic Greek model, e.g. a medallion, on the frame of the Porta della Mandorla (P1. 5c, e)3; Niccolo Niccoli and other collectors certainly possessed a number of Greek works of art,4 but they were rare and hardly considered superior to the Roman remains. The situation was different in other centres. There is a Greek tendency distinctly traceable in the North Eastern Italian schools of the same period.6 The proximity of Greece across the Adriatic may be responsible for the philhellenic spirit in the centres on Italy's east coast. Ciriaco's heritage points to Rimini. Here, too, the decisive artists, L. B. Alberti and Agostino di Duccio, were Florentines but the spiritus loci was different. In Rimini there was no truly Latin giant like Donatello. Matteo de' Pasti was superintendant of the works, and he is known to have possessed a manuscript of Ciriaco's : his humanistic friends had strong Greek sympathies. Sigismondo Malatesta's court poet was Basinius, the first Italian devotee of Homer, whom the pope asked to translate the Iliad, and who at the time of his death possessed little more of valuables than a Homer manuscript which he bequeathed to his patron. From his war in Greece, Malatesta carried home the body of Gemisthos Plethon, the philosopher, much as the Crusaders used to carry 1 Cf.

He buried Plethon in a monumental sarcophagus in S. Francesco "ob ingentem eruditorum quo flagrat amorem."' Sigismondo presided at a memorable disputation on the eminence of the Greek language between Basinius and two other court poets. Basinius' thesis was that no poet writes perfect Latin without a thorough knowledge of Greek. His enemies denounced him as a traitor, they doubted his patriotism. He replied that his preference for Greek was not self-willed, Sed sine Graecorum auxilio Romana valere Non multum semper docui semperque docebo. The dispute ended with the defeat of Basinius' enemies, both of whom had to leave the court.2 On the exterior of the church of S. Francesco two large marble slabs display in letters of great perfection a Greek eulogy of Sigismondo.3 And it is a minor but characteristic detail that a manuscript of one of Basinius' Latin poems contains glosses to the Latin text in the Greek language.4 The outstanding work of art created in this atmosphere is S. Francesco, the "Tempio Malatestiano." Pius II condemned it because of its pagan character.5 In it is Isotta's tomb, erected by Sigismondo while she was alive. Her epitaph D. ISOTTAE ARIMINENSI B.M. SACRVM is so unchristian, so much after the antique manner that the pope's condemnation appears comprehensible. The interior is decorated with reliefs, one of which is clearly a copy of a gem design derived from a 5th century Greek model (Porta della Cella della Vergine, P1. 6a, c).6 This might have been an isolated case as was the relief on the Porta della Mandorla in Florence. But in Battaglini's excellent paper on the literary court of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, published in I794, we read an unexpected statement. "Some later writers believed that Sigis- mondo brought many pieces of Greek sculpture from Greece for the decora- tion of his new Temple, especially eighteen slabs of Greek marble on which the noble arts and sciences are represented as standing women."'7 Battaglini does not share this opinion because the style of the marbles is not elegant and perfect enough, and also because the Malatesta rose appears on some dresses. Yet there is a grain of historical truth in this astonishing opinion. Sigismondo actually took a good deal of building materials from S. Apollinare in Classe in Ravenna, but these were materials only, not sculptures. Greek influence on the Malatesta artists, however, dominated their style to such an extent that their works could be mistaken for Greek originals. It is hardly an exaggeration 1 C.

This was recognized long ago.' The question which has not been answered yet is which Greek works Duccio could have seen, and where he received the impulse to study them. And all tends to indicate that the Ciriaco manuscripts which Matteo de' Pasti possessed, which Fontius copied and which seem to have made little impression on Florentine artists, kindled the enthusiasm of the Rimini sculptors. They helped to create the philhellenic atmosphere in which the Greek eulogy on Sigismondo was written and the pseudo-Greek reliefs of the Tempio were created. It is interesting to observe that the most promi- nent figure in Sigismondo's monument to his ancestors, patronized by Pallas Athene, seems to be derived from the portrait of Aristotle which we found in Fontius' manuscript (P1. 6f).2 The Policy of the French Chancellor G. de Rochefort and his Interest in Fontius' Work It has never been pointed out that one of the manuscript copies of Fontius' work-the Ashburnham manuscript3-which contains many of the same inscriptions and drawings as our codex, belonged to a pupil of Fontius, Francesco Pandolfini, who may have obtained it direct from the author himself as a personal gift or bequest. Francesco's father, Pier Filippo Pandol- fini, was a man at home both in the diplomatic sphere and in the republic of the learned. Francesco became Fontius' pupil and heir, to whom the master dedicated in I485 an edition of Phocylides. "that by this author's admonitions he may accustom himself to lead a perfect life."4 As the first pages of our manuscript are missing we are not in the same lucky position to establish its first owner. But in one of Fontius' letters, written in 1489 after his return from Budapest, we hear about another copy of the collection which the author had sent to France. Cosimo Sassetti, a relative of Francesco, and one of the directors of the Medici bank at Lyons,5 informed Fontius that the chancellor of France, Guillaume de Rochefort, "wished to 1 F.

II, 8, he also dedicated his translation of Demosthenes' Wspt t j apapEaCfBaS to Francesco; cf. Marchesi, op. cit., p. 165. Francesco himself compiled the index of the Pandolfini Library (Catalogo della Libr. Pandolfini, Florence 1884). It includes two copies of Fontius' Phocylides translation and a copy of the Greek original (pp. 22, 23, 52) ; also Fontius in Persium and his Praefationes in principiis studii. In the first half of the I9th century Libri owned a number of the Pan- dolfini MSS. These, including the Fontius epigraphic collection, turned up in 1853 at the Ashburnham Sale, and were eventually bought back for the Florentine Library. The Fontius Collection is hidden under no. 281 of the old Pandolfini catalogue: Liber Monu- mentorum romanae urbis et aliorum locorum, in penna cop. di rosso in papiro. The same title occurs in the manuscript (see CIL. IX, p. XXXVII). 5 A. Reumont, Lorenzo de Medici, 2nd ed., 1883, II, pp. 298, 301 ff.-R.

SAXL possess the ancient monuments collected by him in times past." Fontius who had heard of the chancellor's interest in and patronage of learning, com- plied with this request.' As our manuscript comes from Italy it can hardly be Rochefort's copy. But Fontius' letter throws some interesting light on the transmission of humanist learning through diplomatic channels. The peace of Europe in these critical years depended on Lorenzo Medici; his diplomatic genius succeeded in delaying the threatening invasion of Italy, which only took place after his death.2 Personal presents played a not in- considerable r6le in I5th century diplomacy, and Cosimo Sassetti frequently had to use this delicate weapon by order of his employers and on their account. The story of a diplomatic giraffe is well known. Ciriaco d'Ancona had seen a giraffe in Cairo, and circulated a drawing of it among his many friends (our manuscript contains a copy of it. P1. 9d).* When, therefore, in I487 the Sultan sent a mission to Florence to discuss with Lorenzo the affair of Prince Djem, Bajazeth's brother, who was kept a prisoner at the French court, he could not find a more impressive and acceptable gift than a giraffe.4 Lorenzo, eager in his turn to promote his diplomatic aims, promised the animal to Anne de Beaujeu, Regent of France. When by the middle of April, 1489, the gift had not arrived, Anne wrote a pressing letter with a clear hint at the "one good turn deserves another" principle ... "cest la beste du monde que jay plus grant desir de veoir. Et sil est chose pardeca que je puisse faire pour vous, je my emploieray de bon cueur."5 But alas! the giraffe had already died. Madame was beside herself. Cosimo Sassetti tried to find a remedy. He remembered that among the Sultan's gifts there had also been a good balsam; would Lorenzo present it to the Regent with a few personal lines?6 Very likely the manuscript which Fontius sent at Sassetti's request served a similar purpose. But the interesting factor is that a collection of classical monuments and inscriptions was considered to be a suitable diplomatic gift for a 15th century chancellor of France. Guillaume de Rochefort was indeed a remarkable personality. One of the first patrons of humanism in French administration, he started his career at the court of Charles the Bold. As his ambassador he repeatedly went to Italy at the time when Bernardo Bembo, a famous humanist, was accredited at the court of Burgundy. He was in Rome in 1469, conferred with Colleoni in 1471 and 1473, was sent to Italy on a special diplomatic mission, signed the 1484 treaty with Venice.7 Renaudet in his admirable book on Prdriforme et humanisme 1 Ep.

Faustus Andrelini, two Italian scholars who imported to France the good style and the bad manners of some of their learned compatriots. The chancellor's office was concerned with the affairs of the University. Rochefort sympathized with Gaguin, who asked for and received his help against the troublesome theo- logians. "May the chancellor believe that nothing will award him more praise and greater fame with posterity than to look after the liberty and the advancement of scholars;" those are the closing words of one of Gaguin's addresses to Rochefort.1 Gaguin said in prose what the two Italian poets said with a flourish. Balbo, playing on the Latin form of the chancellor's name- de Rupe Forti-sings: Rupe sub hac placidi nitet indulgentia veris . . . Spargit odore Venus; pingit Dea Flora colore . . . Rupe sub hac Faunique colunt, Satyrique bicornes Leneusque pater.2 No less a person than Urania urged Andrelini to leave Italy, and to offer his gifts to Rochefort, patron of poets. For in France, from the firm rock's (fortis rupis) lofty summit, magnanimous William welcomes the hearts of the learned.3 Andrelini was a pupil of Pomponius Laetus who collected Roman inscriptions in the original and filled his house with them; the Roman Academy crowned Andrelini for his poems.4 One of them is so antiquarian in style that it may well have appeared in Fontius' collection. The poet scolds his love for having broken a painted "alexandrian" vase which he describes in detail: on it were represented Ganymedes performing a libation to Jupiter, Mars and Venus causing Homeric laughter, the Judgment of Paris, and Apollo.s The poem reminds one of the genuine marble vase repre- senting Bacchic scenes of which Sangallo, the sculptor of the Sassetti tomb, had made a careful drawing." Andrelini shares the archaeological taste of the Roman group, and his Paris friends were well disposed to chime in. Balbo and Andrelini were neither great scholars nor good poets but they were the apostles of both, and as such they were well received and of im- portance. They did some useful pioneer work in their easy way. But they could hardly have satisfied a man like Rochefort. The collection of ancient monuments which he received from Fontius was a weightier gift. It is pleasant to imagine that the chancellor of France was one of the learned dilettantes 1 Epist., op. cit., II, p. I44. 2H. Balbi, Op., Vind. I791, p. 211. For biographical dates see R.

SAXL capable of enjoying the contents of our manuscript, the emotions, the wisdom, the poetry and glamour of the classical inscriptions. We learn from his political efforts that he was well fitted to do so. When on 30th August, 1483, Louis XI died, his son Charles VIII was thirteen years of age, and difficult constitutional questions had to be settled. At the be- ginning of the year 1484 the Etats gendraux were convoked. It has been said that no assembly in the annals of France conducted itself with so much public spirit and moderation; nor perhaps had that country ever had so fair a prospect of establishing a legitimate constitution. Rochefort opened the session with an oration--outstanding in the history of French parlia- mentary eloquence.1 In the name of the king he entreated the assembly to co-operate with the crown for the benefit of the state. It is for the representatives of the people in preference to all others to devise and produce the medicine of which the sick body of France is in need. The sufferer himself is best fitted to recognize the remedy and to search for it with energy.2 This strong appeal to his audience to make practical use of the parlia- mentary system is, if not the effect of a revival of antique political theory, at least compatible with it. Rochefort uses Cicero's own words in order to define his idea of the state. "The common-wealth is the people's business, the people a multitude united by law, agreement and a community of interest."3 The sentence res publica est res populi stands invisibly over the entrance of every parliament; it can even be understood as a threat to anyone who should dare to jeopardize the popular sovereignty. As concerns the inner organization of the common-wealth, Rochefort adheres to the anthropomorphic conceit widely current in his time4 and which represents the state under the image of a body the parts of which co- operate in harmony. The essential notions of the "corpus rei publicae" and its members he may have found in Cicero.5 He also revived Cicero's en- lightened conception of the noblemen who are to strive after the people's affection and glory, not after wealth or such dominance as would be in- tolerable to the people.6 "Providete salubriter omnia sine metu, sine favore"'--one wonders if ever before a chancellor had spoken such words to the representatives of the people in the presence of king and nobles. Rochefort was no revolutionary Cola di Rienzo; but there was a new, learned and noble, Rienzo in the assembly, Philippe Pot, Lord of La Roche, who quoted the Roman traditions with a different and harsher accent: 1 Printed in Journal des Etats Gin. de France tenus a" Tours en 1484 red. par J.

With Cicero and Rochefort he maintained that the state is the concern of the people, but he added that the people had transferred or given it to the king.' We are reminded of the scene when Cola read the Vespasian law to the Romans in order to prove that even the emperor's authority derived from the people. Rochefort's thought and language are much less radical; he is a realist in the less flattering sense of the word. But it remains a great merit for a chancellor of France at the end of the i5th century even to have tried to enforce certain democratic principles. Rochefort acted thus in conformity with the ancients. The same Rochefort who studied the classics to improve the government of France, the same who in his discourse called Charles VIII "justitiae et pacis amator,"2 a few years later asked Cosimo Sassetti to obtain for him a copy of Fontius' monumenta antiqua. Lorenzo Medici and Guillaume de Rochefort both died in 1492, the latter after having successfully negotiated the marriage between the king and Anne de Bretagne. This was Rochefort's last contribution to the consolidation of France. His prediction that the king would go down in history with the name of pacificus3 did not, however, come true. Charles decided on the invasion of Italy and the conquest of Naples. Fontius survived his patrons, and when on the Ides of March, 1494, Alfonso of Aragon became heir to the throne of Naples he wrote to the new king's former master, his friend Pontanus, a letter which, for the peace-loving citizen that he was, is remarkably bellicose: "Gain confederates in Italy, win over the Spaniards and the Germans; above all, appease the French at all costs. But failing this, fight with invincible strength of mind, and should Fortune thwart your valour, do not allow the enemy to conquer without bloodshed."4 Soon after, the storm broke and Italy was invaded. Charles, having "triumphed" over Naples, returned to France, loosing the army for which the people had paid so unwillingly. Honest Fontius had decided just in time not to continue the struggle for the secular existence of a scholar in this atmosphere of European tension. In Florence Savonarola's sermons had begun to reach a wide audience; in 1491 he prophesied the imminent death of Lorenzo, the pope, and the king of Naples. Francesco Sassetti died in the same year. Eight months only had elapsed since Fontius had written to Rochefort, but the short span had sufficed to throw doubt upon, if not negative, the values of the world of humanism. At the very date when Savonarola's ascendancy began he wrote a pathetic letter to a friend from the country place to which he had retired: "Quid ergo demens excogito in rebus inanibus et caducis tempus absumere? . . Cur ... stabilia pro infirmis, certa pro dubiis, tranquilla pro turbulentis, perpetua pro caducis relinquo?" Fortune may arbitrarily withdraw wealth and honours, but she cannot take away virtue and learning.5 At the death of Lorenzo de' Medici, a year before Charles VIII invaded Italy, Fontius 1 Journal des Et.

Sofia drawing (repr. by Sangallo on f. 28r of the Bar- berini Codex).
