Gregory Ap- plied Optics , vol. 14, no. 5, pp. Al 18, A120, May 1975. Begin a review of a technical book by stating bibliographic data. Then briefly outline the book and state its scope (e.g., textbook, reference). Estimate the amount of space for each subject (depth of treatment). Describe the author's credentials for his authority on the subject. Finally, appraise the book for its use to the profession, its readability, and its appearance. - D. A. Whittaker 762-020 BOOK REVIEWS IN PRIMARY JOURNALS. A. Manten, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 227-236, 1975. Because editorial instructions to book review- ers are often brief and incomplete and style manuals offer little guidance, the author gives general rules concerning the publication of reviews in professional journals and the writing of such reviews. - E. P. Dandridge Communication 762-021 COMMUNICATION NOTES: A DIGEST OF NEWS FOR COMMUNICATION PROFESSIONALS. F. Capshaw (ed.), Communication Notes: A Digest of News for Communication Professionals , vol. 1, no. 10, Dec. 1975. Published by the Council of Communication Societies, this monthly compiles news stories, advance meeting notices, reviews of current publications, and editorial opinion about current events related to all forms of communication. - V. M. Root Diction 762-022 THE LOGOS OF COMPUTER LOGORRHEA. J. Jones and A. Shriver, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 207-225, 1975. Cybernetics has fostered a mis- leading and imprecise vocabulary which threatens to obscure man's ability to use the computer as a tool. Examines the roots of several cybernetics-related misconceptions and the resulting anthropomorphic nonsense and grammatical fallacies now permeating our thinking and language. - E. P. Dandridge Editing 762-023 THE ROLE OF THE EDITOR IN AUSTRALIA. G. Williams, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 167-180, 1975. From experience as an editor in Australia, discusses some elements and techniques of editing potentially applicable to other countries: format, typography, printing, edito- rial duties, instruction manuals, and liaison. - E. P. Dandridge House Journals 762-024 CHARACTERISTICS OF TECHNICALLY ORIENTED HOUSE JOURNALS. M. Drott and C. Griffith, IEEE Transac - Technical Communication, Second Quarter 1976 13</page><page sequence="2">tions on Professional Communication , vol. PC- 18, no. 1, pp. 45-49, Mar. 1975. Analyzes 275 house journals concerned with research, development, and hardware in the US, UK, and France. Most are quarterlies sent primarily to customers. More articles are signed in the US than in UK or France. Frequent features are abstracts, meeting notices, editorials, and ads. The subject matter of all journals is highly specialized. - E. P. Dandridge Information Handling 762-025 ENCYCLOPEDIC STORAGE OF TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. H. Schwarzlander, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication , vol. PC- 18, no. 1, pp. 35-44, Mar. 1975. Encyclopedic storage of knowledge avoids unnecessary duplication and provides easy access to materials. The technique described is based on the properties of knowledge transfer via the written record, leading to the development of a "unit." In terms of units the "size" of available knowledge can then be estimated, and the unit becomes the basic building block of the system. A small experimental version now exists. - E. P. Dandridge 762-026 THE CONSUMERS OF NEW INFORMATION TECH- NOLOGY: A SURVEY OF THE UTILIZATION OF MED- LINE. Tagliacozzo, Journal of the American Society for In- formation Science , vol. 26, no. 5, pp. 294-304, Sept. -Oct. 1975. Searches of scientific and technical literature are an important building block in the preparation of many technical papers. The effective use of on-line retrieval systems can assist immeasurably in such searches. The characteristics of one such system, MED- LINE, a bibliographic review of the National Library of Medi- cine, and the characteristics, purposes, and expectations of users of the systems are investigated. - J. E. Mortland Management 762-027 ANNUAL REPORT COST CONTROL. A. Balkind, Public Relations Journal, pp. 27-29 , Sept. 1975. Use of PERT (program evaluation and review technique) can significantly reduce ex- cessive report costs resulting from overtime and author's altera- tions. PERT's five major benefits are (1) structuring and schedul- ing production network, (2) assigning task responsibility, (3) pro- viding up-to-date status reports, (4) indicating where special ef- fort is needed to meet delivery, and (5) acting as a historical record. A sample PERT chart is reproduced. - E. P. Dandridge 762-028 FISH OR CUT BAIT: CORPORATE DECISION-MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY. R. M. Walsh, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 137-142, 1975. Managerial decision-making frequently takes place under less than optimal conditions. An actual decision-making problem is pre- sented which responsible department heads were unwilling to resolve because of unknown risks. With the benefit of both hindsight and detachment, the author presents a decision report which could have been prepared from existing data. - C. M. Black man Presentations 762-029 MULTIPLE-IMAGE PRESENTATION OF TECHNICAL PA- PERS-THE CONCEPT. L. Demer and L. Fentnor, IEEE Transactions on Professional Commuņication , vol. PC- 18, no. 1, pp. 11-17, Mar. 1975. Characteristics of multiple-image tech- niques for audio-visual communications are analyzed and advan- tages over sequential methods are emphasized. Features and production techniques are described. The technique offers exciting potential for the presentation of technical papers and needs further attention. - E. P. Dandridge 762-030 EFFECTIVE ORAL PRESENTATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION. H. Estrin and E. Monahan, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 187-198, 1975. A good technical presentation requires careful preparation, judicious use of notes, and wise choice of visual aids. Knowing the basic elements of delivery and being able to avoid some of the common pitfalls are essential. Gives several lists of do's and don't's. - E. P. Dandridge 762-031 EFFECTIVENESS OF MULTI-IMAGE PRESENTATIONS. B. Fradkin, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 53-68, 1975. Three types of visual presentations were viewed over different time periods. They were designed to test the ability of viewers to recall cognitive information from linear, two-, and four-image programs. Evaluation was measured by multiple-choice tests immediately, 24 hours, and 7 days after exposure. Significant differences in recall appear to favor linear presentation. Further research is needed, especially on combined visual-audio input. - E. P. Dandridge 762-032 TECHNICAL SPEECH: A NEED FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH. H. Hand, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communications , vol. PC- 18, no. 1, pp. 18-21, Mar. 1975. Survey results indicate practicing engineers want technical speech train- ing. College courses in technical speech could be improved if teachers knew more about the differences between technical speech and other types. Research in matters of audience, delivery, and visual aids can provide this information. - E. P. Dandridge Printing/Production 762-033 EIGHT PUBLICATIONS IN NINETEEN HOURS AND THEY ARE NOT EVEN A PRINTER. Anon., Book Production Indus- try , vol. 51, no. 6, p. 29, Nov. 1975. Information on more than 1200 stocks is distributed to over 250 subscribers every week by the printing plant of a stock brokerage firm. The books are produced each weekend in a dedicated facility by standard and modified COM repro equipment. The operation reflects what a private plant can do when it is designed for speed. - K. A. Caird 762-034 OPTICAL CHARACTER READER IS MECHANICALLY, OPTICALLY SIMPLE. Anon., Production Engineering , vol. 46, no. 11, pp. 11-12, Nov. 1975. An optical character reader developed by Taplin Business Machines can read a densely typed page in about 10 seconds. The device reads bar codes beneath the gothic characters of a special golf-ball font for an IBM Selectric 14 Technical Communication, Second Quarter 1976</page><page sequence="3">typewriter. Reports can be transmitted to video displays at remote locations. - N. J. Schulman 762-035 PHOTOSETTING KALEIDOSCOPE: 1. DEFINING THE OP- TIONS; 2. CONSIDERING THE OPTIONS. Anon., British Printer , vol. 88, nos. 8-9, pp. 42-51, 54-65, Aug. -Sept. 1975. This two-part article reviews phototypesetting components and options available ancļ evaluates each of these in light of specific needs of prospective users. - J. E. Mortland 762-036 GRAPHIC COMMUNICATIONS WEEKLY. A. E. Gardner (ed.), Graphic Communications Weekly , vol. 8, nos. 38-47, Oct. -Dec. 1975. Contains information about new equipment, reports on activities and acquisitions of graphic corporations, lists of graphic conferences and symposia, and reviews of relevant articles, presentations, and books. Of special interest: Homographs by Autocomp. Homographs, words that are spelled the same but have different meanings, often pose problems in hyphenation. The editor of GCW discusses the problem and lists over 75 pairs of such words compiled by Waverly Press for their own keyboard operators. The list is a valuable aid to hyphenation, as well as an indication of one of the oddities of the English language (no. 43, p. 8). Readability of Printed Text. The comparative readability and cost of unjustified text is the subject of a guest editorial by E. R. Lannon, who laments our adherence to tradition and gives some interesting statistics and references to support his contention that ragged right isn't wrong (no. 45, p. 2). In response, Ted Mullen portrays a composition arrangement dedicated solely to easy reading. Consideration of the natural fixations of the human eye leads to an unconventional "square pattern" of text words that is unquestionably faster to read, though apparently complicated to set (no. 47, p. 3). Micrographics/ COM. The National Micrographics Association has issued a 200-page book by Daniel Costigan, Micrographic Systems ($16.50 to nonmembers), that describes all forms of micrographics including reductions of printed pages and film printouts of computer-generated data (no. 40, p. 10). Another booklet on microfilm is available ($1.95) from the PR department of the 3 M Company: Microfilm: Active and Vital. Although less than half of it is devoted to COM, the booklet is a complete summary of the microfilm story (no. 38, p. 10). Movie About Autocomp. An 8-minute, 16-mm film on the Comp/ Set 500 Phototypesetter can be borrowed from the Varityper Division of AM, 1 1 Mt. Pleasant Ave., East Hanover, N. J. 07936 (no. 40, p. 6). Training for Training Manuals. An exchange of guest editorials and contributor comments about tech manuals - mostly about the lack of them in new equipment - has revealed the existence of an organization devoted to training people in the development, design, and writing of instruction manuals: Manuals Corporation of America, 53 William Penn Dr., Stony Brook, N. Y. 1 1790 (no. 42, p. 11).- K. A. Caird 762-037 COMPUTER DETECTION OF TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. R. Morris and L. Cherry, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication , vol. PC-18, no. 1, pp. 54-64, Mar. 1975. A computer program written for the UNIX time-sharing system significantly reduces the task of finding words containing typo- graphical errors in a document. The program is adaptive in that it uses statistics from the document itself in the analysis. Lists of common technical words and frequent typos and misspellings are appended. - E. P. Dandridge 762-038 A PROGRAM TO HYPHENATE ENGLISH WORDS. W. Ocker, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication , vol. PC-18, no. 2, pp. 78-84, June 1975. Describes a logical hyphena- tion program for computerized typesetting which bases decisions on certain characters, strings of characters, or vowel and conso- nant patterns; it uses word-division rules from Webster's New International Dictionary. The program, coded for the RCA Spectra 70/45, recognizes prefixes, suffixes, and other letter combinations requiring special processing. - E. P. Dandridge 762-039 METRICATION AND THE GRAPHIC ARTS. C. T. Ray, In-Plant Printer , vol. 15, no. 3, pp. 8, 12, 13, Apr. 1975. Conversion to the metric system will change present standards for paper weight and size in the graphic arts industry. International standards for paper sizes are based on a rectangle with a ratio of 1 to the square root of 2 ( 1 : 1 .4 14). Basis weight is expressed in grams per square meter. The same basic unit of area (square meters) is used for all grades of paper. Lists of metric paper sizes and weight conversion factors are given. - R. F. Ellis 762-040 TWO DECADES OF GROWTH IN PHOTOCOMPOSITION: 1960-1980. F. Romano, Inland Printer / American Lithographer , vol. 175, no. 6, pp. 45-48, Sept. 1975. Describes developments and trends in typesetting technology, including text phototypesetters, input keyboards, computer systems, CRT typesetters, video edi- tors, optical page readers, and laser typesetters. - R. F. Ellis Rhetoric 762-041 IF, NOT, AND, OR, BUT, CONJUNCTIONS IN SENTEN- TIAL AND DEDUCTIVE LOGIC. M. Jordan, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 23-38, 1975. The simple conjunctions are defined in terms of truth tables to show the relationship between logic and linguistic coupling words. Principles of deduction in technical writing are discussed in terms of linguistic couplers, of the technical level necessary for understanding the premises, and of the criteria for judging arguments in different fields of reasoning. Detailed references and an annotated bibliography are provided. - E. P. Dandridge Semantics 762-042 GENERAL SEMANTICS. C. S. Read, ETC: A Review of General Semantics , vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 243-255, Sept. 1975. Reviews general semantics: tells of its origins, its basic premises, and its basic principles; discusses its wide-ranging applications; and lists the organizations and publications concerning it. - R. J. H off statter Style 762-043 COLOR THEIR PROSE GRAY. M. Orth, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication , vol. PC-18, no. 2, pp. 65-66, June 1975. Too many engineers and scientists resign themselves to a Technical Communication, Second Quarter 1976 15</page><page sequence="4">tradition of stylistic dullness that makes their papers lifeless. Attention to verbs can promote vividness, directness, force, and interest, but the resultant style will be generally accepted only as a new philosophy of style evolves to overcome historical adverse conditions. - E. P. Dandridge 762-044 READABILITY IN TECHNICAL WRITING- PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES. G. Schindler, Jr., IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication , vol. PC- 18, no. 2, pp. 67-70, June 1975. The concept of readability - here defined as level of reading comprehension - seems not to concern most technical writers. Evidence and reasons for this indifference are presented, and three current methods of measuring readability are described: Dale- Chall, Fry, and cloze. These are applied to passages of technical prose, and some implications of readability concepts are sugges- ted. - E. P. Dandridge 762-045 WHY ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS WRITE AS THEY DO- TWELVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR PROSE. G. Schindler, Jr., IEEE Transactions on Professional Communica- tion !, vol. PC- 18, no. 1, pp. 5-10, Mar. 1975. Although the writing of scientists and engineers is often severely criticized, the critics seldom discuss the reasons for weaknesses and faults. Analysis of technical writing shows that many of the "faults" are justifiable if not carried to extremes and if not used inappropriately in writing for nontechnical readers. - E. P. Dandridge Teaching 762-046 A NEWSLETTER WRITING PROJECT IN AN INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL WRITING CLASS. P. G. Ashdown, The Technical Writing Teacher , vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 12-13, Spring 1975. Producing a technical newsletter in a class project that can help the general writer penetrate the world of specialized information and help him comprehend the explication of technical subject mat- ter. - C. M. Blackman 762-047 THE ASSESSMENT OF COMMUNICATION SKILLS. D. Bratchell and G. Mitchell, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 39-46, 1975. Assessment of communication skills by technical teachers using traditional methods based on the essay is inadequate. Objective tests are helpful but somewhat artificial and limited in value. A course journal used at the University of Wales to replace the essay has proven extremely useful in providing clear objectives and a high degree of motivation in improving communication skills. - E. P. Dandridge 762-048 A SCIENTIFIC WRITING COURSE. L. J. Callazzo III, The Technical Writing Teacher , vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 14-16, Spring 1975. Presents a rationale and syllabus for the scientific writing course at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science. The student is encouraged to look at scientific writing as an integral part of his science education. - C. M. Blackman 762-049 THE INCIDENCE OF SENTENCE OPENERS IN SELECTED TECHNICAL OR SCIENTIFIC PERIODICALS AND JOUR- NALS. J. Chard, Journal of Technical Writing and Communica- tion , vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 91-98, 1975. Analyzes a variety of published technical and scientific writing and suggests that students can approximate professional style by determining the types and incidence of sentence openers in their own manuscripts. - C. M. Blackman 762-050 COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA, COMPUTERS, AND EDU- CATORS. A. David, Journal of Technical Writing and Communi- cation , vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 237-254, 1975. Describes the design and use of an experimental mathematics instruction system in which TV and telephone were linked to the computer, which stored instructional materials and presented them to students through its control of TV broadcast and voice-response units. Results indicate that today's technology can be used to create individualized and convenient instructional tools. - E. P. Dandridge 762-051 READINGS IN TECHNICAL WRITING: AN ORIENTATION WORKSHOP. S. Gresham and C. Kaltenbach, The Technical Writing Teacher , vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 4-8, Spring 1975. In a two- week orientation to the technical writing course at University of Missouri-Columbia, students are given a bibliography of readings in four areas: the theory of technical writing, the practice of technical writing, disciplinary history, and professionalism. Re- ports and discussions are based on the readings. - C. M. Blackman 762-052 PRINTING EDUCATION AND THE FUTURE. M. F. Guldin, In-Plant Printer , vol. 15, no. 6, pp, 18, 35, July/Aug. 1975. Education programs in graphic arts should be broadly interdisci- plinary to prepare persons for the increasingly technical operations of the printing industry. Training should include basic courses in the physical sciences, applied technologies, aesthetics, and man- agement. - R. F. Ellis 762-053 NEW DIRECTIONS IN TEACHING TECHNICAL REPORT WRITING. M. Jordan, Journal of Technical Writing and Com- munication, vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 199-205, 1975. Traditional principles of English grammar and those advocated by grammarians, journalists, and literary scholars are not always helpful to technical writers. Discusses some of the important distinctions between technical and nontechnical writing and the shortcomings of traditional instruction and offers suggestions for the improvement of technical writing. - E. P. Dandridge 762-054 TRAINING TOMORROW'S WRITERS. J. Kowal, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 181-185, 1975. Only rigorous training by the traditional methods enables writers to think clearly and then record that thinking eloquently on paper. Instant-success correspondence schools cannot meet this need. - E. P. Dandridge 762-055 SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND THE SCIENCE WRITER. M. Ryan and S. L. Dunwoody, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 83-90, 1975. In response to a mail survey to determine the advantages of specialized training, 152 science writers recommended taking courses in journalism, a variety of sciences, and science writing, as well as working in a research laboratory. - C. M. Blackman 762-056 A SYLLABUS FOR A COURSE IN SCIENTIFIC AND TECH- NICAL COMMUNICATION. T. M. Sawyer. The Technical Writing Teacher , vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 17-23, Spring 1975. Presents a detailed syllabus of a course in scientific and technical communica- tion at the University of Michigan. External examiners evaluate the student. - C. M. Blackman 16 Technical Communication, Second Quarter 1976</page><page sequence="5">762-057 GRAPHIC COMMUNICATIONS EDUCATION ON THE SECONDARY AND COLLEGE LEVELS. J. Simich, In-Plant Printer , vol. 15, no. 6, pp. 16-17, July-Aug. 1975. Graphic communications is taught under various academic departments, including industrial arts, vocational/technical education, design/ fine arts, journalism, advertising, and business. Two-year, four- year, and graduate-level college programs are available. The Graphic Arts Technical Foundation provides teaching aids and other supportive services to educators in this field. - R. F. Ellis 762-058 INCREASING STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN TECHNICAL WRITING CLASSES. B. B. Sims, The Technical Writing Teacher , vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 9-11, Spring 1975. Several assignments can help increase student involvement in technical writing classes: determining the uses of style sheets, determining the effect of audience on content, investigating methods of printing and repro- duction, and interviewing professionals in their fields. - C. M. Blackmail 762-059 TECHNICAL WRITING: NEW NAME OR NEW COURSE? D. W. Stevenson and J. C. Mathes, Teching English in the Two-Year College , vol. 2, no. 1, pp. 15-19, Fall 1975. Teachers of traditional composition moving into teaching technical writing must reassess their ideas about what constitutes effective writing. Variety in nontechnical prose may be evaluated on stylistic criteria; technical prose must be judged on the basis of its usefulness to the reader. - E. P. Dandridge 762-060 THE ELECTRIC REPORT CARD: A FOLLOW-UP ON CAS- SETTE GRADING. C. B. Stratton, Journal of Technical Writ- ing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 17-22, 1975. Assesses the program at the University of Idaho for evaluating student papers with cassette tapes: it increases the instructor's effective- ness, and students find such evaluation helpful. If students furnish their own erasable tapes, over-all cost can be kept less than $200. The system also lends itself well to many real-world situations - critiquing presentations, reviewing manuscripts, evaluating pro- posals. - E. P. Dandridge 762-061 AN INTERDISCIPLINARY REPORT WRITING COURSE. W. M. Thilsted, The Technical Writing Teacher , vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 1-3, Spring 1975. The report writing course at Oklahoma State University is a service course for 12 departments. The syllabus consists of nine units, from which the student and instructor select an individual course. Writing assignments are submitted both to the writing instructor and to an instructor in the student's major. - C. M. Blackman 762-062 AGAINST SUBSTITUTING TECHNICAL WRITING FOR FRESHMAN ENGLISH. M. Whitburn, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 47-51, 1975. Both freshman English and technical writing are important. Freshman English should concern itself with general communication skills, and technical writing should continue to involve the application of these skills to special forms of communication. - E. P. Dandridge Translation 762-063 WHAT EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TRANSLA- TION. J. Lufkin, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communi- cation , vol. PC-18, no. 1, pp. 22-28, Mar. 1975. Because translation is a creative and not a mechanical process, machines cannot translate serious technical texts usefully. Literal or word- for-word translations are not translations at all and should be discouraged. Required are a full command of both languages and a knowledge of the subject. The use of idiomatic language in the target language is one evidence of quality. There are others. - E. P. Dandridge Writing 762-064 THE LETTER OF QUERY. J. R. Gould, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication , vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 107-1 17, 1975. The letter of query is the best way of starting a technical article on its way to being published. Six reasons for writing such a letter are discussed. Twelve points of information for the contents are given, along with a sample letter. - C. M.
