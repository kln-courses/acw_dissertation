<plain_text><page sequence="1">Black and White Myths: Etymology and Dialectics in Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" Paul Allen Miller Quand les souffles de ses ancêtres veulent souffler la bougie (grâce à laquelle peut-être subsistent les caractères du grimoire)- il dit «Pas encore!»1 At the beginning of Les dieux antiques, Mallarmé describes how the lin- guistic unity of the Indo-European people first became fragmented, ren- dering a universal or perfect language impossible.2 He argues that as a result of the migrations of the Indo-Europeans, sound and meaning be- came separated from one another, making direct expression unattain- able. Consequently, a work of self-conscious poetic, linguistic, and cultural recuperation was necessary to "donner un sens plus pur aux mots de la tribu."3 Although the Edenic moment when sound and sense, language and myth, the universal and the particular were one, had been shattered, it was not unrecoverable: Quelqu'un de vous demandera si toutes ces tribus emportaient avec elles leurs déités. Elles emportaient au moins une langue commune, à laquelle étaient confiés des mythes communs. L'éloignement où vécurent l'une de l'autre les peuplades errantes ou fixées, fit que leur langue se différencia et se refondit en idiomes nouveaux: et de la même façon les mythes, mêlés intimement à la parole, acquirent une existence nouvelle et isolée. Mais les langues et les mythes ne sont jamais si complètement transformés, que deux sciences, celle du Langage et la My- thologie, ne puissent pas, par leur effort récent, retrouver la parenté origi- nelle des mots et des dieux. (LDA, 1170, emphasis added)4 The implications of this fall from an original state of linguistic grace and the subsequent need for a work of recuperation are central both to Mallarmé's conception of the "oeuvre pure" and his famous "Sonnet en yx" ("Crise," 366). According to the myth, as he tells it, in the beginning there was linguistic and cultural unity.

Box 7819, Austin, TX 78713-7819</page><page sequence="2">Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" 185 fragmentation and distortion occurred. It is the modern poet's task to re- cover this state of grace through a symbolic order that subsumes both the original unity and its subsequent fragmentation into a new, higher synthesis: "l'explication orphique de la terre."5 One means of creating this new symbolic order is through a thorough knowledge of the history of the language, its patterns of evolution, and their philosophical impli- cations. This interest in the poetic possibilities of historical philology is in many ways typical of the period.6 In the latter half of the nineteenth cen- tury, the newly elaborated discourses of comparative mythology and Indo-European linguistics were providing revolutionary explanations for the historical origins of Western culture. The impact of these discur- sive practices on Mallarmé can be seen most clearly in Les dieux antiques and Les mots anglais. Thus, Les dieux antiques, a free translation of George Cox's Manual of Mythology supplemented with passages from The Mythol- ogy of the Aryan Nation, shows both a general knowledge of the field and of the work of Cox's mentor, Max Müller.7 By the same token, Les mots anglais displays a keen interest not only in the general theory of histori- cal linguistics but also in the specific etymological roots of modern En- glish and French.8 In addition, Charles Chassé has shown that Mallarmé knew and made frequent use of Littré's dictionary with its trove of ety- mological information.9 For Mallarmé, words were not discrete, indivis- ible units of meaning but many-layered, historical objects.10 One other aspect of Mallarmé's thought on language and history that requires examination is its debt to Hegel. The relationship is essentially threefold. First, there is good evidence from Mallarmé's letters and from the testimony of contemporaries that in the early 1860s, while experienc- ing a profound personal crisis, the poet began a study of Hegel that had a crucial impact on his conception of the ultimate poetic work, "Le Livre."11 Second, Littré himself figured prominently in the neo-Hegelian movement of mid-nineteenth century France, providing an important link between the poet's linguistic, historic, and philosophical specula- tions.12 Finally, Hegelian philosophy is important for understanding Mallarmé's interest in historical linguistics because, for Hegel, Being is always construed as a historical category. Essence can only be grasped as "Being Past," as "gewesen."13 Thus, the "explication orphique de la terre," from a Hegelian point of view, would of necessity be historical, resuming the story of the race through language: presenting the never- ending dance of being and negation through the very vocables that make articulation possible.14 The poet, as Mallarmé wrote, becomes "une aptitude qu'a l'Univers Spirituel à se voir et à se développer." His task is not to express a personal vision but to produce the spectacle of "la matière, ayant conscience d'être ... et proclamant, devant le Rien qui</page><page sequence="3">186 Paul Allen Miller est la vérité, ces glorieux mensonges."15 Only thus can poetry, through history, become Absolute Spirit.16 1 In this paper, I shall demonstrate how this complex matrix of concerns is played out in the singularly difficult "Ses purs ongles très haut dédiant leur onyx." My contention is that Mallarmé uses the Latin and Greek etymologies of individual words,17 as well as their mythological associ- ations, to fashion a poem that enacts the roles of language and con- sciousness in the production and erosion of meaning in the prehistory of the West. In each case, it will be observed that the etymological roots and their mythic connotations refer either to the cosmic cycles of the stars and sun- which Mallarmé believed embodied for early man the primal struggle between being and nothingness- or to the correspond- ing cycles of life and consciousness found in individual human beings. Indeed it was Mallarmé's conviction, as well as Cox's, that all mythology and all religious and philosophical concepts stem from primitive human- ity's attempt to name and understand the eternal cycling of the sun, its death and resurrection, or what Mallarmé termed "la tragédie de la Na- ture." Mythology itself was a product of the linguistic drift occasioned by the splitting up of the original Indo-European, linguistic plenum, which caused terms that were formerly concrete and descriptive to be- come detached from their original context.18 The poet's challenge, then, is not so much to deny history as to embody it within the compass of a single text. Hence, each of the etymologies examined in this sonnet will refer to at least one of the following elements: light, dark, the curve as synecdoche for the cycle, or the convergence of opposites, as a synthetic movement embodying the previous three. Additional evidence recommending this sonnet for an etymologically based commentary can be found in a letter to Cazalis of July 1868, in which Mallarmé describes an early draft of the poem as having been drawn from a study on language he was preparing (possibly Les mots anglais or Les dieux antiques). In the letter, Mallarmé states that the poem's content consists of a mirage internal to the words themselves, "J'extrais ce sonnet, auquel j'avais songé cet été, d'une étude projetée sur la Pa- role: il est inverse, je veux dire que le sens, s'il en a un ... est évoqué par un mirage interne des mots mêmes."19 Moreover, the description of the poem as "un mirage interne des mots mêmes" directly parallels one of the characteristics Mallarmé later attributes to that mysterious concept, the "pure work": L'oeuvre pure implique la disparition élocutoire du poète, qui cède</page><page sequence="4">Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" 187 l'initiative aux mots, par le heurt de leur inégalité mobilisés; ils s'allument de reflets réciproques comme une virtuelle traînée de feux sur des pierreries, remplaçant la respiration perceptible en l'ancien souffle lyrique ou la direction personnelle enthousiaste de la phrase. ("Crise," 366)20 Likewise, Mallarmé states in the same letter that the poem is "aussi «blanc et noir» que possible," thus establishing a parallel duality to light and dark, day and night, being and negation. It is my contention that the dialectical interaction between these contradictory pairs forms the body of the sonnet.21 One final aspect of the poem not merely authorizes but demands an etymological reading of the sonnet: Mallarmé's use of the word ptyx. As is well known, ptyx is not French but Greek. Before Mallarmé, the word appears only in Hugo's "Le satyre," where it is used as the name of a hill. Thus, the very presence of this word, which has meaning in Greek but not in French, requires examination to see if it fits into a larger pat- tern of etymological usage within the poem. There are, however, certain objections to be met before proceeding, the most influential of which have been put forward by Michael Riffaterre in his discussion of the poem in the Semiotics of Poetry.22 His argument is essentially threefold. First is the claim that Mallarmé himself said he did not know the meaning of the word. The best evi- dence for this is a letter to Lefébure dated 3 May 1868, in which he writes that he is composing a sonnet and has only three rhymes in ix. He then tells his former teacher, "concertez-vous pour m'envoyer le sens réel du mot ptyx, on m'assure qu'il n'existe dans aucune langue, ce que je pré- férais de beaucoup afin de me donner le charme de le créer par la magie de la rime."23 From this, Riffaterre draws the unwarranted conclusion that when reading the 1887 version of the sonnet we must presume that Mallarmé was still ignorant of the meaning of the word. This interpre- tation assumes that between the time of the letter, when Mallarmé had not yet finished his initial draft, and the poem's publication nineteen years later, Mallarmé never found the information he was seeking (we do not know if Lefébure wrote back). It also assumes that we are to take Mallarmé's profession of ignorance at face value, even though his capac- ity for exaggerated self-deprecation was legendary.24 Finally, this appeal to Mallarmé's intentions violates Riffaterre's own methodological pre- scriptions. As he himself writes, "The only relevance of poetics is to the text itself, not to the author's intention: good method demands that ar- guments be based on the poem alone."25 Thus the letter to Lefébure is hardly decisive and can be taken as positive evidence that Mallarmé was searching for the meaning of the word.</page><page sequence="5">188 Paul Allen Miller Riffaterre's second objection to an etymological reading of the poem is that "the word ptyx itself is a hypothesis of lexicographers, deduced from a rare Greek word found only in the plural or in oblique-declension cases, ptykhes; Mallarmé could not have known this." Yet this argument is self-contradictory. First, it claims that Mallarmé's linguistic knowledge was too limited to have known about this word, since its only attested uses are in cases other than the nominative singular, so that the form ptyx itself never appears in our extant texts. The nominative singular was deduced from those that do appear for the purpose of listing it in a standard Greek dictionary (where nouns are listed by their nominative singular form). Yet if we assume with Riff a terre that Mallarmé was ig- norant of the word's linguistic history, then it is precisely the nominative singular form that the poet would have been familiar with because that is the form he would have found in any Greek lexicon. It is instead the details of its usage, upon which Riffaterre bases his argument, that the poet would have been least likely to know. If, however, we credit the poet with more linguistic sophistication than Riffaterre does, then Mallarmé would have recognized that one cannot say that no nomina- tive singular form existed just because it is not found in our surviving texts. The vast majority of early Greek usage was either never recorded or has been lost to us. The Greek texts we now possess represent only a tiny portion of Greek linguistic behavior. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn as to the existence or nonexistence of the form ptyx in actual speech.26 Finally, Riffaterre argues that Mallarmé first found the word in Hugo's "Le satyre" and that Hugo had used it "for the sake of strangeness per se, since in his poem it is supposed to be the name of an actual mountain translated into the language of the Gods- neat proof that ptyx has no meaning in any human language." Yet there is no good reason to believe that if ptyx was used as a nonsense word by Hugo (a highly speculative assumption),27 it must therefore function the same way in Mallarmé's text. Such reasoning is neat proof that one can dispense with searching for the term's meaning only if, like Riffaterre, one is in the process of trying to prove that the poem as a whole is a self-consuming artifact, "without content- emotional, moral or philosophical."28 This interpre- tation, in turn, is supposed to illustrate Riffaterre's larger claim that po- etry is a closed entity without significant mimetic relations to the world.29 Riffaterre's reading is thus based on a preexisting theoretical as- sumption and not on the particulars of either Mallarmé's or Hugo's text. Indeed, a close reading of Hugo's "Le satyre" merely reinforces the case for the kind of etymological/mythological commentary I propose. First, "Le satyre" itself is entirely mythological, telling the story of a rus- tic faun dragged before the gods on Olympus and commanded to per-</page><page sequence="6">Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" 189 form for their amusement. Second, in the same passage that contains Hugo's use of the word ptyx ("on entendait Chrysis, / Sylvain du Ptyx que l'homme appelle Janicule / Qui jouait de la flûte au fond du crépus- cule"), we find a faun named Chrysis, a transliteration of the Greek word for a "golden vessel" (khrusis).30 Half the rhymes in Mallarmé's sonnet end either in or or ore, which in French is the sound designating the substance gold. And gold itself is used frequently by Mallarmé as metonymy for sunlight.31 The faun is also musical and thus poetic, and his song is associated with the twilight time of dawn and dusk ("le cré- puscule") and so with what Mallarmé terms "la tragédie de la Nature."32 Third, the faun of the title represents something close to a Hegelian consciousness of history. His is the story of a cosmic becoming, which will one day overturn the gods themselves, and he himself represents the poetic self-consciousness of that becoming. Je regarde le gland qu'on appelle Aujoud'hui, J'y vois le chêne; . . . Moi je songe. Je suis l'oeil fixe des cavernes. Je vais. Olympes bleus et ténébreux Avernes, Temples, charniers, forêts, cités, aigle, alcyon, Sont devant mon regard la même vision; Les dieux, les fléaux, ceux d'à présent, ceux d'ensuite, Traversent ma lueur et sont la même fuite. Je suis témoin que tout disparaît.33 In a play on words, the faun, Pan, comes to represent the conscious to- tality of the universe, past, present, and future, for the word pan in Greek is the word for all.34 The faun's song, then, is the poem of the uni- verse. As the Master himself said, "Au fond ... le monde est fait pour aboutir à un beau livre."35 In sum, the case for disregarding the status of ptyx as a Greek word is far from convincing, and many of its main points can be just as easily used to argue for an etymological reading of the word and the poem as against it. Mallarmé's interest in historical linguistics, comparative my- thology, and Hegelian philosophy establishes the general intellectual framework within which such a reading finds its justification. What re- mains to be shown, then, is that this reading is consonant with the poem as a whole. It is to that task that our attention will now be directed. 2 The first thing to note in the poem is that its structure is cyclical. Beginning</page><page sequence="7">190 Paul Allen Miller in the night sky and progressing through the interior of the "salon vide" to the absolute nothing of the Master's journey to the Styx, it then re- turns through the room and its window to the seven stars of the Great Bear constellation, or "septet." The reflection of the seven stars in the mirror doubles their number to fourteen, thus recalling the number of lines in the poem. If we accept with Cohn and Noulet that one level of significance accruing to the phrase "ses purs ongles" is a reference to the "septet," then the poem would begin and end in the exact same place. Its center would, as in a circle, be diametrically opposed to its beginning and end.36 Hence, the pattern of the initial seven lines (or stars), re- flected by the second seven lines (or stars), would replicate not only the structure of the sonnet but also its iconography, with the heavens at the beginning and end point of the circle and the Styx as its diametrical op- posite. At minimum, we may observe a regulative pattern within the poem integrating the spatial infinity of the heavens, the finite or indi- vidual space of the "Master's" salon, and death as the ultimate negative principle in a single, circular sweep. Ses purs ongles très haut dédiant leur onyx, L'Angoisse, ce minuit, soutient, lampadophore, Maint rêve vespéral brûlé par le Phénix Que ne recueille pas de cinéraire amphore Sur les credences, au salon vide: nul ptyx, Aboli bibelot d'inanité sonore, (Car le Maître est allé puiser des pleurs au Styx Avec ce seul objet dont le Néant s'honore). Mais proche la croisée au nord vacante, un or Agonise selon peut-être le décor Des licornes ruant du feu contre une nixe, Elle, défunte nue en le miroir, encor Que, dans l'oubli fermé par le cadre, se fixe De scintillations sitôt le septuor.37 The first line is paradigmatic of the etymological patterning that runs throughout the poem. The relation of ongles, and onyx is of particular in- terest. Set at opposite ends of the line, each is derived from a common Greek root, onux, which possesses a variety of meanings, but its primary sense is essentially that of ongles, the claws of an animal or the nails of a human. It is only by an extension of the initial set of qualities denoted by the word that it later came to mean a "veined gem," or more particularly</page><page sequence="8">Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" 191 "onyx."38 Thus, if we accept R. G. Cohn's translation of the first line, "her pure nails very high up dedicating their onyx," as well as his inter- pretation of the ongles as "the distant cold stars which seem to be an or- ganic part, a projection of the universal anguish [i.e., the Angoisse at the beginning of the second line],"39 then we shall observe a sort of overture being played on the harmonic relations that characterize the poem's im- agery, the semantic content of its nouns, and their etymology. Mallarmé, by increasing the gap between sound and meaning that separates ongle from its "parenté originelle," onux, through a metaphorical transforma- tion of nails into stars, has allowed the ongles to regain their original sound value [oniks], while permitting onyx to regain its original meaning (nails).40 Just as these two estranged moments of linguistic history con- verge at their point of derivation, onux, when they are projected to the apex of the night sky, so the line itself rolls up its ends to converge at the caesura between haut and dédiant. We thus find in this one line all the elements previously mentioned: light and dark, the cycle of the heav- ens, a convergence of opposites, and all achieved through an examina- tion of the etymological root of the words at opposite ends of that same line. In the very first line, then, identity and difference are subsumed into a Hegelian unity of opposites.41 This sublimation of difference into unity, however, is but momen- tary.42 Its ideal self-identity is balanced by the powerful centrifugal forces inherent in the very history that produced it. The difference can- not be erased; ongle remains ongle and onyx, onyx. They have not shifted positions on the page, nor been removed to a mythical vanishing point in Greek history, where the separate trajectories of their evolution would be annulled. Even the imagery maintains this assertion of differ- ence. For, while the white ongles, as the stars, are projected upon the dark night sky, the striped onyx remains a gem of the earth. The duali- ties effected by history are maintained, even in the moment of their de- nial. The white stars shine against the black background of night, while onyx consists in alternating bands of black and white.43 Unity and dif- ference, light and dark, exist simultaneously and are distributed equally throughout the line. Even the time of night ce minuit, reflects this dialec- tic, for midnight is by tradition the hour of greatest darkness, but also that in which the day begins its ascent.44 Yet perhaps the most important indication of the mythic significance of this etymological and imagistic interaction resides in the observation that its effect is predicated on the initial projection by "Anguish" of the finite ongles onto the infinite heav- ens, thus ratifying their participation in the cyclic drama of the cosmos. These cycles and oscillations between individual words in the poem do not, however, exist independently of one another but rather form part of a complex and overdetermined system. Hence, while ongles and</page><page sequence="9">192 Paul Allen Miller onyx are syntactically dependent upon the subject of the first sentence, the establishment of that subject immerses the reader in yet another cycle of mutual determination and etymological play that spreads throughout the poem. In general, critical opinion has agreed on its choice of L'Angoisse as the subject of the sentence, but this is not the whole of the matter. The problem with such a reading is its presupposi- tion that the subject must be univocal and self-identical. It imposes an ontology on the poem that is not supported by the text, the syntax of which is ambiguous. The difficulty lies not so much with U Angoisse but in determining that to which lampadophore is apposite. Claude Abastado explains: Si la syntaxe donne sens, elle est aussi, parallèlement, «pivot» de l'intelligibilité, c'est à dire source d'ambivalence. Comme l'anamor- phose en peinture ou le chatoiement d'une étoffe de moire, la con- struction de la phrase mallarméene permet de «lire» des images doubles. Une lecture engendre un sens que la relecture abolit; du «désastre» surgit un autre sens, en vertu d'une nouvelle ordon- nance. . . . Pour créer des surimpressions, toutes les ressources syn- taxiques interviennent. . . . Lampadophore est, selon l'usage rapporté à Angoisse; mais Mallarmé antéposé souvent l'apposition ... et on peut lier ce mot à rêve.45 If one accepts this double apposition of lampadophore, then normal sub- ject-object relations collapse because rêve is by all accounts the direct ob- ject of soutient, whose subject is Angoisse. But if Angoisse is identified with lampadophore, and it, in turn, is identified with rêve, then the dis- tinction between actor and acted upon, subject and object, is dissolved into a higher synthesis, centered on the figure of the lampadophore.46 These grammatical considerations may be further integrated with the poem's thematic concerns if the historical and iconographical connota- tions of the "torchbearer" are taken into account. Thus, as will be shown, the lampadophore is associated with the Latin Vesper, god of the evening star and son of Aurora, as well as the lampadephoroi who ran in the torch races at the agones (games) in Athens (Littré; Liddell and Scott). These connections can then be shown to link up with both the poem's celestial imagery (the stars that begin and end the poem) and the ety- mologies of Angoisse, Agonise, and vespéral. The real significance of this complex fabric of image, syntax, and sense, founded upon the double appositive relation of lampadophore to the subject and direct object of the first sentence, may be unfolded, however, only through a detailed anal- ysis of each of its constituent elements: L'Angoisse, lampadophore, and the Maint rêve vespéral brûlé par le Phénix. We shall take them, in turn.</page><page sequence="10">Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" 193 To understand the import of Angoisse in the context of the dialectic be- tween ongles and onyx found in the first line and the syntactical crux in the second and third, translation is insufficient. Rather, taking into ac- count the anthropomorphism implied by ongles, Angoisse may initially be identified as a personification of the sensation produced by being squarely placed between converging opposites.47 Etymologically, it de- rives from Latin angustus, meaning narrow or constricted.48 Yet the as- sociations that allow it to move from a spatial concept to the equivalent of our word "anguish" are best comprehended by examining a range of cognates drawn from the same Indo-European root. Angoisse and angus- tus are related both to the German angst and the English hang. Other En- glish cognates include angle, ankle, and anxiety. In Greek we find relatives in both the noun agkos (a bend, or valley, or closeness) and the verb agkho (to press tight, strangle, or throttle) (Liddell and Scott). In all cases, we observe the denotation of a fold or angle, created by a con- junction of opposing lines or forces, frequently accompanied by an im- age of strangulation or severe unease. The etymology of Angoisse denotes a coming together that nonetheless maintains the concept of op- position or difference, such as that found in the convergence of ongles and onyx. This designation of a curve or fold not only functions as a trope for the cyclical structure of the sonnet as a whole but also repli- cates the original sense of the sonnet's most enigmatic word, the much- debated ptyx.49 For the moment, it is enough to note that from the perspective of its etymological associations, Angoisse possesses a clear relation to the convergence of ongles and onyx enacted in line 1. Conse- quently, it may be said that Angoisse as the nominal subject not only con- tains all the elements of the first line but also gives them a human perspective, denoting a sensation rather than an object. This drama of opposition and convergence is heightened only by the fact that Angoisse can be read as apposite to ce minuit, that point in time when the forces of night and day are most equally balanced.50 If we were to transpose this analysis into a more lyrical mode, we would say that Angoisse is the personification of the awareness of one's own finiteness arising in the face of infinity. It is, in short, the space of dreams, midway between being and negation: a region where positive and negative, black and white, are forever changing positions. As Ellen Burt writes: Anguish, the feeling of anxiety in the face of danger, is one with the hour of midnight, the moment of highest tension in the solar drama. . . . Perhaps, more important, Anguish is an apprehension which springs into being in the face of the pure, physical infinite</page><page sequence="11">194 Paul Allen Miller universe, at the same time as it is threatened with extinction by this boundless space.51 It is a dialectical apprehension, consisting of the fullest appreciation of the nature of one's being and the perception of its ultimate negation. From this perspective, the apposite "torchbearer" (lampadophore) be- comes the lamp of dream or consciousness, as it radiates against the boundless night. It too becomes a human projection so that, like ongles, it functions as a focal point that both illumines infinite space and ob- scures it by virtue of its categorical difference from that which it illu- mines. Moreover, given the apposite relation between Angoisse and lampadophore, it must be assumed that the attributes of the one accrue to the other. Thus the ongles (stars) become equally the torches of the lam- padophore. By both syntax and sense, maint rêve vespéral brûlé par le Phénix itself becomes identified with the subject, Angoisse. A unity of light in this manner emerges, binding the stars of the infinite heavens, the light of the individual psyche, and the history of human consciousness in a singular dialectic with the endless space of night. In less imagistic terms, "Anguish," predicated on the self-recognition of the finite in the face of infinity, gives rise to the self-consciousness of infinity as a predicate of equal necessity. Each of these poles negates the other at the same time as it makes the other possible. The infinite cannot exist in a meaningful sense without the consciousness possessed by the finite, at the same time as the infinite serves as the finite's ultimate negation. The "torch- bearer's" gleam, then, becomes one with that of the stars, the stars with the light of dream, and the projection of "Anguish" onto the infinite, night sky the ground of consciousness itself.52 Several conclusions may be drawn from this reading. First, Cohn's interpretation of the lampa- dophore as "the mild lamp-like glow of the moon" is clearly inadequate.53 Second, the union of subject and object in the first quatrain, as well as the identification of ongles in line 1 with septuor in line 14, imply a con- comitant unity of light throughout the poem. Consequently, the stars of the first and last lines would become one with the "agonizing" or of line 9, as well as with the lampadophore and maint rêve vespéral of the first qua- train.54 This last point may be pursued with some vigor. For if such a unity exists, then, consistent with the pattern already established, we might expect to find definite etymological and mythological connections bind- ing these elements together. The location of such connections is not dif- ficult; the problem lies in their unfolding, since the text Mallarmé has woven is so tight as finally to defy explication. Let us attempt then only to set forth the general configuration by returning to the lampadophore and examining its relation with Agonise (line 10), and vespéral (line 3).</page><page sequence="12">Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" 195 Two reasons suggest Agonise as a starting point. First, as the verb con- trolling the subject un or, it presents a point of access to the unity of light (and so implicitly of dark) which joins the octave to the sestet. Second, the position of Agonise in the line, as well as its etymological derivation, suggests certain affinities with Angoisse. In terms of etymology, Agonise, like Angoisse, traces its origins to a Greek root suggesting a meeting or struggle between opposites. Its closest relative is agonia, meaning a "struggle," such as that found at wrestling or gymnastic contests, and by extension the sensation experienced by the contestants (i.e., "agony" or "anguish"). Agonia, in turn, is derived from the masculine noun agon, referring to any large coming together, whether a citizen's assembly, the lines of opposing armies, or an organized athletic contest. It was also personified as Agon, the god of the games (Littré; Liddell and Scott).55 With these observations in mind, a set of correspondences between Angoisse and Agonise may be formulated. First, each in its etymology is founded on an act or state that simultaneously entails convergence and opposition. Second, each appears in an analogous position to the other, so that while Angoisse is the first word in the second line of the octave, Agonise stands as the first word in the second line of the sestet. Third, there is at least a hint of personification in the capitalization of Agonise (given its link with the Greek god Agon and the precedent of Angoisse), in spite of its position at the beginning of the line. Fourth, the similarity of the Greek roots for both words- ag- for Agonise and agk- for Angoisse- appears to point toward a common derivation at some point in the prehistory of the Indo-European tongue, much like that found for onyx and ongles, although as far as current scholarship is concerned, no such point exists.56 Finally, halfway between the noun Angoisse and the verb Agonise, we find the past participle Aboli, so that negation or obliv- ion mediates between them, while the stars appear on both sides. Yet for all the evidence of correspondence between Angoisse and Agonise, as in the case of ongles and onyx, no final unity is maintained. Each remains on opposite sides of the volta, as each remains on opposite sides of the "Master's" descent to the Styx (lines 7-8): the negative jour- ney to complete interiority begun from the infinite space of absolute ex- teriority. Grammatically, the two words remain the complementary but opposed halves of any statement, the subject and the predicate, the noun and the verb. In short, they are part of the tropology of being and negation, the dialectics of light and dark that inform the sonnet. Still a unity can be seen, and seen to exist in difference. It finds its fullest expression in a third and pivotal term, the lampadophore. For while syntactically the lampadophore expresses an equivalence with Angoisse, historically it participates in the sphere defined by Agonise. Again, the focus is on etymology. Lampadophore, as noted above, ultimately derives</page><page sequence="13">196 Paul Allen Miller from the Greek lampadephoros (torchbearer) but possesses a set of poetic connotations that are far richer. The word generally refers to the contes- tants running in the lampadedromia (torch race) held at the Athenian fes- tivals for Prometheus, Hephaestus, and Athena (Liddell and Scott). It thus possesses an intrinsic relation with the agones (games) the root of which is the same as that from which the verb agoniser derives. However, to really understand the lampadophore's metaphorical signif- icance, a brief look at three representative passages from classical Latin and Greek literature will prove helpful. All three passages are common and likely to have been known by Mallarmé. The first is from Aeschylus' Agamemnon, where Clytemnestra, at the beginning of the play, tells the chorus how she has just been informed of the victory at Troy and Agamemnon's expected return: Chorus: What messenger Could fly so fast from Troy to here? Clytemnestra: The god of fire Ida first launched his blazing beam; thence to this palace Beacon lit beacon in relays of flame. Crossing the Aegean, like the whip-lash of lightning flew The resinous dazzle, molten gold, till the fish danced, As at sunrise, enraptured with the beacon's glow, Which woke reflected sunrise on Makisto's heights. Such, Elders, was the ritual race my torchbearers Each at his faithful post succeeding each fulfilled.57 Here the torchbearers, the "lampadephoroi," are directly linked to strug- gle (agonia), victory, knowledge, and life, yet ironized and given a dark- ness by their coming together on the eve of Agamemnon's murder. Thus, the associations of light are balanced by those of darkness. The allusion to the cycles of the sun ("as at sunrise"), which Mallarmé refers to in Les dieux antiques as "la tragédie de la Nature," gives the passage a wider significance, allowing the machinations of the individual charac- ters to be subsumed into the larger field of the "drame solaire." The im- plications of this passage go far beyond the scope of our investigation, but its references to the interpenetrating cycles of being and negation, victory and death are clear. Another example of the use of lampadophoros, possessing a similar set of connotations, may be found in Plato's Laws, 6.776.B. This too is a widely known passage and listed in the Larousse Grand dictionnaire uni-</page><page sequence="14">Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" 197 versei of 1873 as an example of the common metaphorical usage for lam- padophore:58 . . . wherefore a man and his wife shall leave to his and her father and mother their own dwelling-places, and themselves go as to a colony and dwell there . . . and they shall beget and bring up chil- dren, handing on the torch of life from one generation to another, worshipping the Gods according to Law forever.59 By far, the most famous example of the lampadophore' s metaphorical use begins at line 71, from book 2 of Lucretius. The end of this passage is also listed in the Larousse, where it is cited as "le vers bien connu de Lucrèce." Here the concerns are more exclusively metaphysical: . . . the sum is seen to remain unimpaired for this reason, that whenever bodies pass away from a thing they diminish that from which they pass and increase that to which they have come, they compel the first to fade and the second on the contrary to bloom, yet do not linger there. Thus the sum of things is ever being renewed, and mortal creatures live dependent upon one another. Some na- tions increase, others diminish, and in a short space the generations of living creatures are changed, and like runners pass on the torch of life. (2.71-79)60 The figure of the lampadophore is thus a traditional image, directly linked with what we have identified as the major concerns of the sonnet: light versus dark, being versus negation, and the process of history itself, whereby the torch of life and consciousness is passed from one genera- tion to another, shining for a brief moment against the infinite darkness, then dying, and reappearing. The torches, which both celebrate the vic- tory of Agamemnon and plot his death, are then, at least for a moment, one with the "purs ongles très haut," dedicated by "Angoisse" at the hour of midnight. Having examined Agonise and lampadophore, let us turn to the remain- ing term vespéral and its relation to what was earlier termed the sonnet's unity of light. A point of access to this area of discussion is the conjuc- tion of the lampadophore, as an image, with the mythological content im- plicit in the etymology of vespéral. From this point, we may trace the implications of such an analysis throughout the sonnet, though our spe- cific concentration will be on how they relate to the various Greek and Sanskrit solar myths associated with the Phénix (line 3), the nixe (line 11), and the septuor (line 14). Hence, where previously a unity of subjective light was shown through the double linkage of the lampadophore, as lamp</page><page sequence="15">198 Paul Allen Miller of consciousness and dream, to Angoisse and Agonise; here, a unity of ob- jective light, reflected through the flame of dream, will be shown to join the stars of the first and last lines with another set of myths based on the cycles of the sun. Clearly, in each instance, the notion of subjectivity or objectivity is relative. But this inability to isolate subject from object only serves to reflect the dialectical tension that is both the poem's major the- matic characteristic and a feature of its syntax. The imagistic connection between the lampadophore and the etymology of vespéral is quite easily established. As noted above, the Latin god of the evening star, Vesper, whose name supplies the root of the French adjective (Littré), was recognized as being identical to that of the morn- ing star, known as. Lucifer ("Lightbearer") in Latin and Phosphoros (also "Lightbearer") or Eosphoros ("Dawnbearer") in Greek. In each case, the ending -fer or -phoros, derived from the Indo-European root meaning "to carry" or "to bear," is etymologically the same as that found at the end of lampadophore.61 Indeed, the meanings of all four of these terms are essentially indistinguishable. Moreover, the implicit connection between the light of dream and consciousness and the sym- bolism of the fall from the infinite into the finite, as represented by the Christian reading of Lucifer, would have surely appealed to Mallarmé and is consistent with the patterns found in the poem at large. The bringer of light then is at one with the prince of darkness. Moreover, Vesper himself, unlike the two previous personifications of Angoisse and Agonise, was no mere abstraction. He had, in fact, a fully developed mythology and genealogy that may be shown to link him and the generations of his family to the nixe, the Phénix, and the septuor. In- deed, through the mythology of Vesper, we are able to see how the "dream" (i.e., "maint rêve vespéral") is brought into direct confronta- tion with the cycles of the infinite cosmos, in a fashion analogous to that which gave rise to "Anguish," as described by Burt. Equally important, we see how Mallarmé employed etymology and mythology to join the cycles of human life and the cosmos in a dialectic of mutual recognition. Let us look then to the genealogy of Vesper. Ancient sources disagree as to who his father was, but in general there appears to be a consensus that his mother was Eos, or the Latin Aurora.62 Eos, however, as Graves points out, was not merely the mother of Vesper (Hesperos in Greek), but also his feminine counterpart: At the close of every night . . . saffron robed Eos . . . rises from her couch in the east, mounts her chariot drawn by the horses Lampus [as in lampadophoros] and Phaethon, and rides to Olympus where she announces the approach of her brother Helius. When Helius appears she becomes Hemera, and accompanies him on his travels</page><page sequence="16">Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" 199 until as Hespera, she announces their safe arrival on the Western shores of Ocean.63 The genealogy at this point becomes a bit confused, for Eos as Hespera or Hemera is given a different lineage from when she is strictly the "Rosy Fingered Dawn." In the latter two roles, she is said to be one of the Hesperides, a group of nymphs "living in the far West" who "with the aid of a serpent guard the apple tree that grows there."64 The Hes- perides, in turn, are, according to Hesiod, who is explicitly listed as a source in Les dieux antiques (1251), the children of "Night," or Nux: And Night bares hateful Doom and black Fate and Death, and she bares sleep and the tribe of Dreams. And again the goddess murky Night, though she lay with none, bares Blame and painful Woe, and the Hesperides who guard the rich golden apples and the trees bearing fruit beyond glorious Ocean.65 Thus, taken together, the family of Eos and Vesper encompasses the whole of the solar cycle. They are also the source of "Dreams" and their necessary concomitants, "Death" and "Woe." Nor should we fail to note the wider implications of the apple, the serpent, and the guarding maids, for here we find a sort of felix culpa motif that permeates the poem from its beginning: a simultaneous testimony to the fall from an original state of linguistic grace, the multiplicity it occasions, and the rec- ognition that a precondition for the existence of the present is the nega- tion of the past. In this regard, it bears remembering the fact mentioned earlier that one of the names for Vesper was Lucifer. A similar though not altogether identical set of associations may be generated from an analysis of the etymological and mythic connotations of nixe (line 11). Traditionally, nixe has been translated "nixie," a Ger- man water nymph, but this represents an oversimplification of the prob- lems the figure presents.66 First, the pronunciation of nixe in French is identical to that of the Greek goddess Nux (French "Nyx"), or "Night," who, according to Hesiod, gave birth to Eos in the form of the nymph Hespera.67 Second, the first entry under nixe in the Larousse is not "Génie ou nymphe des eaux chez les Germains," but "Nixe: Mytholog. Se dit de divinités romaines qui présidaient aux accouchements et qu'on représentait appuyés sur les genoux." Clearly then, there is a classical as well as Germanic aspect to the nixe. And while the Greek Nux and the Roman Nixi, -ae are not identical, their resemblances in terms of sound, divine status, and mutual connection with the act of giving birth are suf- ficient to establish them each as elements within that constellation of meaning defined by the sequence nixe. Consistent with the sonnet as a</page><page sequence="17">200 Paul Allen Miller whole, however, a true index of the density of meanings that this set of classical associations embodies may be found in the specific differences they manifest. For while Nux, though it gives birth to light, is inextrica- bly bound up with darkness, the sequence of sounds [niks] in Latin also forms another word, nix, meaning the color white, as in "snow," or by extension "the white hairs of old age." Nix, in turn, is derived from the noun nitor, denoting the "brightness, splendour (of heavenly bodies, daylight . . .)" or the "brightness of youth, beauty."68 Hence, the dual- ities defined by the relations governing Latin nix and Mxi, -ae, as well as Greek Nux, are the same as those that bind the poem together as whole- black and white, light and dark, birth and decay. Yet also like the poem itself, the exact value of any one of these poles at any given moment is in question, since the relation that binds a pole and its oppo- site is also always one of apposition.69 None of this, however, is to deny the relevance of the Germanic nixe, but rather to expand its context. The same double set of associations, of being and negation, may likewise be found in a close scrutiny of the Ger- man. Indeed, a similar set of oppositions may be found on at least two levels. First, with regard to pronunciation, it should be noted that nix in German, aside from being the masculine form of nixe, is also a "dialectal and familiar form" of nichts, meaning "nothing."70 Second, with regard to the context of its appearance in the poem, the nixe, like the Nux and Mxi, ae, is clearly associated with both light and sexual generation. As Cohn notes in line 11, "Des licornes ruant du feu contre une nixe": There is another little drama between the "male" (unicorn) element, and the "female" element, the reflecting receptacle-like mirror . . . or the focus of it, the pale naked (cloud-like) ghost of fantasm, nymph, 'nixie' who is ambiguously the reflection of the constella- tion [i.e., le septuor], and of the poet's naked being.71 Ultimately, the chain of mythological and etymological associations leads back to the poet and his confrontation with origin and infinity. The final significance of the genealogy of Vesper and the Indo-Euro- pean mythologies associated with it may be seen in the connections drawn by Mallarmé between the last line's septuor, and the seven "rishis" of Sanskrit myth. Les dieux antiques outlines the base relation in- volved: Vous n'êtes point sans avoir entendu parler des Rishis, sept sages qu'on supposait habiter les sept étoiles de la constellation que nous appelions la Grande Ourse. Ces étoiles s'appelèrent d'abord les sept Arkshas, ou «brillantes», mais comme Rishi vient de la même ra-</page><page sequence="18">Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" 201 cine, on confondit les deux mots, tout comme en Grèce on les con- vertit en ours le mot de arctoi, ours, appartenant également à cette racine. (LDA, 1173)72 In the same passage, Mallarmé writes that Ushas, daughter of Prajapti, or the "Lord of Creation," is in fact the same as "le grec Eos et le Latin Aurora/'73 Prajapti represents "the personified forces of nature as a single cre- ative force"74 but this is a later Vedic concept. Originally there were seven Prajaptis who were identified with the seven Rishis, or Arkshas. Thus, one could argue that Eos, in her guise as the mother and female counterpart to Vesper is in the original Indo-European mythology the daughter of the seven Rishis, that is to say the septuor and ongles that begin and end the poem. Moreover, Mallarmé, in a later passage from Les dieux antiques, argues that the Indo-European root ark- is common to the Greek arktos (bear, hence the septuor), the Latin star Arcturus, and the Sanskrit Arfcs/zas. Therefore, in this single root, the meanings wisdom, consciousness, light, and history are united with the cycles of life and the cosmos in a single, overdetermined package (LDA, 1243). 75 The sep- tuor in the final line, in union with the ongles in line 1 thus becomes the originary source of all light in the poem, affirming both its unity and the interdependence of its objective and subjective dimensions. The effect of this combination is made all the more powerful if we recall the founding thesis of Les dieux antiques: that all the myths of the European tradition are to be understood in light of their derivation from an original Indo- European source, best exemplified in the Vedas (LDA, 1164r-66, 1170- 72). In this regard, it is not immaterial that Cox himself stresses that the Rishis in their original mythic function "are the media or instru- ments through which the divine Veda was imparted to mankind. In its widest meaning the word was taken to denote the priestly bards who conducted the worship of the gods; but they are spoken of sometimes as the poets who compose the songs and present them to the deities."77 The septuor then can also be read as designating the cosmic role of poetry as the self-consciousness of becoming itself. What then is the significance of the Phénix? Strictly speaking, it has no direct genealogical tie to Vesper or his family, and Mallarmé's treatment of it in Les dieux antiques is terse, to say the least. "Quant au Phénix, em- blème égyptien de l'immortalité qui renaît de ses cendres, les Grecs sans se l'approprier le connurent par les récits d'Hérodote" (LDA, 1274). Still, it would be incorrect to say that the Phénix and Vesper are in no way akin; for, on the one hand, the "Phoenix" was traditionally identified with the soul of the renascent Osiris as manifest in the rising of the morning and evening stars, and, on the other, with the sun, for which it</page><page sequence="19">202 Paul Allen Miller was the hieroglyph. Thus the Phénix, in its poetic function as that which lights the flame of dream ("maint rêve vespéral brûlé par le Phénix"), is also that which gives it birth, consumes it, and is ultimately inseparable from it.78 The link between the Phénix and the notions of dream and con- sciousness is further confirmed by the fact that the Larousse lists one of its mythic attributes as the invention of "les lettres et l'écriture."79 The Phénix, therefore, can be seen as standing for the origin of poetry itself. This reading is further corroborated by the word's Greek etymology, since one meaning of phoinix is the Phoenician guitar, linking it directly with the idea of poetry and song (Liddell and Scott). If, moreover, at the end of the process wherein the flame of dream is first lit, flares up, and is then consumed, there were any residue, any ash, that might be dis- tilled from this ceaseless cycling of the Phénix, one might truthfully call that residue "the essence of conscious life," the irreducible remainder of the individual's confrontation with the infinite. But as the poet informs us, there is no amphora, no ptyx to collect that remainder. The poem of life is not possible, at least not yet.80 We return then to the question of how to interpret the word ptyx? In general, it has been translated "conche" under the assumption that it refers to a knickknack in a typical, late nineteenth-century salon.81 This translation, however, is inadequate, for, as shown earlier, the word ptyx has no meaning in French. Hence, one might say with Ellen Burt that "the ptyx is first of all a group of letters that means nothing. The second line- 'Aboli bibelot d'inanité sonore,' which is in apposition to ptyx- comments further on this function."82 Ptyx does, however, have a meaning in Greek. It thus remains true to the established pattern, providing the single greatest justification for the use of the etymological method in understanding the sonnet, since the word remains unintelligible without it. Even in the Greek, though, where we find such diverse meanings for ptyx as "fold," "writing tab- let," "glen," and the "fold of song," there is no support for the tradi- tional reading "conche." Gretchen Kromer puts the matter succinctly: The word is most often used in the plural ... to signify the two sides of the object which have been folded against one another. It never became a technical term, much less a name for a type of shell- fish.83 Again, we must look to syntax for a clue. As early as 1952, A. R. Chisholm had shown that the ptyx was apposite to the amphore. The sense is: "On the sideboards there is no amphore, no ptyx, to hold the ashes of the Phoenix."84 Thus, the missing ptyx is syntactically identified</page><page sequence="20">Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" 203 with the inability of man to isolate the essence of consciousness, to hold its ash. As Cohn writes: The etymology and meaning of ptyx have been much discussed: some see it as related to "fold" or "shell." All these meanings, vase, fold, shell are variants on the elementary meaning: the simplest container of reality (or nothing) a sort of womb from the merest bend or concave shape, the fundamental female Rhythm. . . . The use of pli, "fold" (as in ptyx) as a fundamental Rhythm of reality -a writhing line of writing- is found in "Rodenbach écrit . . . des phrases absolues ... les tend par vivants plis" (311) or "Le pli de sombre dentelle [writing] qui retient l'infini" (1565). The disap- pointing quality of this "womb"- all births lead only to death.85 On one level, the absence of the ptyx represents consciousness' inability to abstract a separate essence from its confrontation with the infinite. All is consumed in the cycles of being and negation. There is no ptyx: "Car le Maître est allé puiser des pleurs au Styx." The curve or fold of the "ptyx" may also be identified with that con- vergence of opposites that characterizes the birth of "Anguish." And so, paradoxically, in its very subjection to negation, the ptyx presents that capacity for dream and reflection that is the concomitant of our finite na- ture. Consequently, the ptyx, in its present absence, its "sonorous inan- ity," may be taken to stand for poetry or reflection itself. Robert Nelson, in a 1959 article, has shown how this may be true if we take ptyx as a nonsense word, used merely to meet the demands of rhyme: . . . taken as a learned neologism on the part of an erudite poet "ptyx" does indeed stand for rhyme itself, but rhyme in turn stands for poetry, the arbitrary imposition of form or meaning [i.e., the projection of consciousness] on the nothingness of existence. ... In verse 8, "ce seul objet" refers back to "ptyx," which is unique in its ability to give sense to the nonsense of existence ("dont le Néant s'honore").86 Gretchen Kromer comes to the same conclusion from an analysis of the word's Greek roots. Establishing first that one meaning of ptyx in Greek is "writing tablet," she notes that its adjectival form, ptykos (folded), oc- curs in book 6 of the Iliad: "And he sent him to Lycia and gave him baneful signs / Having written many death-bringing words in a folded tablet." These lines contain the only reference to writing in Homer and are thus the first</page><page sequence="21">204 Paul Allen Miller place in all of Greek literature where writing is mentioned. It is clear that the later meaning of ptyx is related to this use of the adjective ptykos.87 Later in the article, she produces an analogous example from Aeschy- lus.88 Likewise, in Pindar's Olympian 1, we find, "I am convinced that there is no host today who is ... a more powerful sovereign whom I shall adorn with glorious folds [pfwfans] of song," where the association with poetry is unambiguously clear (lines 103-05). Ptyx thus comes to stand not only for verse or rhyme but for the very possibility of poetry itself- "ce seul objet dont le Néant s'honore"- for that convergence of forces that makes writing possible.89 Poetry, then, is that supreme absence that, were it fully present, would mirror the individual's confrontation with the infinite and the consequent negation that rests in his or her deepest moments of interi- ority. In the ideal, poetry would represent the totality of humanity's cy- cles of being and reflection, up to the present moment, giving to them and the larger cycles from which they have sprung a permanent and lasting form. In the present, it is but an empty sound projected from deepest nothing, filled with the resonances of a mythic past. Yet for that half moment when the ideal presence of pure being and the present mo- ment of absence are brought into conjunction, the whole of history shimmers as in a palimpsest beneath the immediate. It glistens for a mo- ment, then dissolves back into the page, with its marks of black on white. 3 What then has been shown? First, Mallarmé had a clear interest in com- parative mythology and historical linguistics. Second, this antiquarian interest was coupled with a knowledge of Hegelian philosophy, both in terms of its dialectic and its historical theory of spiritual becoming. Third, Mallarmé's use of the word ptyx, which has no meaning in French, but does in Greek, authorizes an etymological reading of this sonnet. Fourth, Riffaterre's objections to such a reading are unpersua- sive. Fifth, the case of the ptyx is anything but isolated. Instead the de- liberate manipulation of Latin and Greek etymologies and their associated mythologies is part of a consistent pattern that structures the poem from beginning to end. Indeed, in a sonnet that opens with the deliberate juxtaposition of two French words, ongle and onyx, which both derive from the same Greek root, it would be perverse to ignore that another of the key words in the rhyme scheme exists only in Greek and not in French. In addition, sim- ilar patterns of etymological and mythological play were found in the</page><page sequence="22">Mallarmé's "Sonnet en yx" 205 following words: Angoisse, minuit, lampadophore, vespéral, Phénix, am- phore, or, Agonise, nixe, and septuor. Nor does this list include the obvious mythic associations of the licornes and the Styx, on which space has not allowed me to elaborate.90 Add to these considerations the fact that the mythological and etymological associations examined formed a coherent pattern, referring either to the cycle of the sun, light and dark, their color analogues white and black, or the logical embodiment of this unity of contraries, the convergence of opposites. The ptyx, thus, when viewed as designating a curve or fold, including that which binds writ- ing tablets together, fits perfectly with the structure of the poem as a whole. The possibility that this complex and coherent pattern was ar- rived at by chance defies probability. It must be viewed as integral to the sonnet's structure. Of course, in the end, the ptyx itself is absent. The curve or fold of writing and song, which would pull all the various strands of history to- gether in a stable synthesis, has left this world and gone to the center of absolute negation, the Styx, from which, if it returns, it will bring shin- ing, crystal tears. The possibility of a final poetic synthesis, "l'oeuvre pure," "l'explication orphique de la terre," is thus simultaneously envi- sioned and deferred. The dilemma of the modern poet is clearly embod- ied: the simultaneous necessity and impossibility of achieving a final dialectical synthesis.91 It is perhaps in this sense that the poem's original title "Sonnet allégorique de lui-même" has its fullest meaning. For what the poem ultimately presents is the both necessary and futile attempt by poetry and the poet to recuperate a fallen historical world.

Mallarmé's interest in myth and its origins is traceable to his early student in- terest in Renaissance poetry (Walzer, 14, 19). Later he compiled a personal an- thology of mythological poems (Seznec, 281) and was queried by fellow writers about books on the subject (see Mallarmé, Correspondance, ed. Henri Mondor and Lloyd James Austin [Paris: Gallimard, 1969], 3: 35-36). His familiarity with Cox, though hard to date precisely, precedes August 1871, by which time he is in London seeking permission to publish a French translation of the Manual of My- thology (Correspondance [Paris: Gallimard, 1965], 2:22). Cox's book was published in 1867 and thus is early enough to have been read by Mallarmé before 18 July 1868, when he writes to Cazalis that he has finished his first draft of the "Sonnet en yx" (Correspondance, 1862-1871, ed. Henri Mondor and Jean-Pierre Richard [Paris: Gallimard, 1959], 278). The Littré was also published in the period be- tween 1863 and 1868, while Preller, whose theories are substantially similar to Müller's and who is cited in the "Avant-Propos" of Les dieux antiques, brought out his Griechische Mythologie in 1854 (LDA, 1159; Charles Chassé, Les clés de Mallarmé [Paris: Aubier, 1954], 36; Renauld, 48-49, 53). The sonnet itself, how- ever, was not published until 1887, by which time it had undergone substantial revision. Mondor and Aubry conclude that the major revisions occurred rela- tively close to the date of publication (OC, 1488-89). It is with this latter version that we shall be concerned here. 8.

A good summary of the poet's position can be found in an article from La dernière mode, in which, while discussing the books that educated people should have in their homes, he writes: "... une langue, loin de livrer au hasard sa formation, est composée à l'égal d'un merveilleux ouvrage de broderie ou de dentelle: pas un fil de l'idée qui se perde, celui-ci se cache mais pour reparaître un peu plus loin uni à celui-là; tous s'assemblent en un dessin, complexe ou simple, idéal, et retient à jamais la mémoire, non! l'instinct d'harmonie que, grand ou jeune, on a en soi" (Mallarmé, La dernière mode, in OC, 828).

See Chassé, 39, "Pour arriver à la compréhension du poète, l'essentiel est d'abord de bien se persuader que le vers: 'Donner un sens plus pur aux mots de la tribu' était une formule de signification très précise. A son point de vue, cette phrase, en langage clair, se traduisait ainsi: employer les mots dans un sens strictement étymologique." 18. Mallarmé, LDA, 1163-70, 1274; LMA, 1050-51; George W.

What can be said with certainty is that the noun does appear in other cases and numbers and that a nominative singular biform ptukhe is found (Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon [New York: American Book Company, 1882]; henceforth cited in the text). 27. Indeed, inasmuch as in Hugo's poem, ptyx is said to name a hill, then its basic Greek meaning of curve or fold is perfectly appropriate; that is, ptyx equals a curve or fold in the earth's surface (Liddell and Scott). 28. This notion is untenable because the denial of content is itself a kind of content. Furthermore, any differences between poems that produce this denial of content would necessarily entail differences in the content of the denial.

It should be noted that the process that permits this meta- phorical transformation is the same as that which originally allowed the Greek onux to refer to onyx as well as nails, an extension of meaning through an ab- straction of the image. 41. G. W. F. Hegel, Encyclopedia of Philosophy, trans. Gustav Emil Mueller (New York: Philosophical Library, 1959), sec. #73, "Everything is grounded in the unity of identity and non-identity, of one and other, of sameness and dis- tinction, of affirmation and negation. The Absolute is essentially dialectical. Di- alectic is the essence of Being or Being as essence. Essence is the sufficient ground of all that seems to be non-absolute or finite. A is non- A: The Absolute maintains itself in that which seems to escape it."
