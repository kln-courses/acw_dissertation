<plain_text><page sequence="1">Of Novices and Scapegoats: Jack Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" Johan Callens Before Richardson was suddenly thrust into the limelight by the success- ful production of The Prodigal (I960), an adaptation of the Orestes myth that earned him several awards, he had written three short stories: "In the Final Year of Grace" (1959), published in the fashionable but now defunct Italian literary magazine, Botteghe Oscure; "The Credence Table" (1960), included in one of the New World Writing volumes; and "Talmus" (1960), which appeared in the Transatlantic Review. These texts should not be considered as discardable juvenilia because Richardson began his career with them and only came into his own with his drama, or because they belong to the short story genre. To many, indeed, "the short story is still running a poor fourth to the novel, poetry, and drama," one of the misguided reasons being precisely that it is considered "a form for apprentices."1 On the contrary, each of Richard- son's stories is substantial enough (even literally so, for "Grace" and "The Credence Table" both run to more than thirty pages, thereby approaching the length of a novella) and sufficiently crafted to receive separate attention. By the same token, these stories should not be re- duced to mere variants in a different genre of the plays that follow them and for which Richardson is best known. To be sure, with the hindsight provided by the plays and novels, the critic has an easier task demon- strating how these stories explore the existentialist lode, mined in the later work, and how they anticipate the drama in general ("Grace" teems with dramatic metaphors, and "Talmus" is set in the world of show business) and Richardson's tragicomic metatheater in particular. Yet the advantage of hindsight also helps the critic to notice what unifies and sets these stories apart from the rest of Richardson's writings: the overall religious frame and the singular treatment to which they subject Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 34, No. 1, Spring 1992 &lt;D1992 by the University of Texas Press, P.O. Box 7819, Austin, TX 78713</page><page sequence="2">42 Johan Callens recurring concerns such as the oscillation between initiation and aliena- tion or victimization. American writers have always manifested a predilection for initiation stories because the inbred American Dream, which fosters visions of innocence, cannot elude the confrontation with experience. American history is to Richardson very much a "contradictory oneiric quest both for adventure and roots, experience and the joys of ingenuousness." As a result, innocence, "soiled and beaten down by the crudities of experience" but never "completely obliterated from our memory," so often forms the "spine" and "ubiquitous protagonist" of its literary history in general.2 In the eyes of Ihab Hassan, postwar American fiction (i.e., from about 1945 to 1960) in particular assumes the shape of the concrete and existential encounter between the self and the world.3 Yet in postwar American fiction (and already beginning in late nineteenth- century literature), the initiation has become problematic and tends toward alienation or defeat, no matter how much resistance the novice puts up.4 The American hero thus starts to resemble his European counterpart, the existentialist hero or rebel-victim described in Camus's Le mythe de Sisyphe, a descendant of the archaic hero presiding over fertility and rebirth rites in which he is the scapegoat.5 In his short stories, Jack Richardson plays with great dexterity upon the ambivalent outcome of initiations in modern times by integrating different points of view and aesthetic responses. In "The Credence Table," the initiation into a private circle (not the community at large- so it may be really an alienation in the common sense of the word) leads to an undesired, hence rejected, victimization, an affirmation of life in the face of death; "Talmus" is less an initiation than a scapegoat ritual, though one can claim that, to the elderly spectators, the séance of the Miracle Body is a kind of initiation; and depending upon the focus- Talmus or the audience- it is either tragic or comic. "Grace" can also be viewed from two complementary perspectives. It can be read either as the narrator's initiation into a Spanish community or as the resolution of a collective crisis through the ritual expulsion of a scapegoat. Whereas the narrator starts out with a tragic potential and ends up participating in a comic celebration of the community, del Rio's early comic antics are brutally and tragically halted. Since the reader must be simultaneously aware of the two opposite movements, from tragedy to comedy and vice versa, the aesthetic response to this story's bifocal vision is equivocal. To provide a reading of "Grace" from these two possible vantage points, we shall first base our analysis on Mircea Eliade's historical and comparative studies of primitive religions and reevaluate the concept of initiation, as it has come to be applied to literature, by going back to its anthropological sources. In the process a number of existentialist</page><page sequence="3">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 43 themes will be brought up for discussion, and some doubts will be raised as to the actuality and success of the initiation. We shall then turn to René Girard' s ethnological accounts of ritual violence. Since copies of Botteghe Oscure are scarce, and "Grace" has not been published else- where, I begin with a detailed synopsis to help the reader follow the subsequent analysis.6 Synopsis Richardson introduces a teacher-writer who withdrew from the world ten years before the events of the story in order to die peacefully in a small, secluded Spanish village. Despite his professional success and material comfort, he experienced a sort of existential anemia, a dearth of strong passions and exciting ideas, a general indifference. Death appeared as the only way out, but since suicide seemed undignified and in bad taste, he had settled for a quiet whimpering out in some incon- spicuous town. Once the confusion usually attending the arrival of a stranger had abated- the narrator was mistaken for a refugee and arrested- he settled in a small, sparsely furnished room facing the town square and its Romanesque church. The first six months he spent rereading all his books, sketching his mother's portrait over and over again, and minutely recording the objects in his room. When these activities provided no further inspiration, he turned to the town plaza with its daily market, its ubiquitous priest, and its social gatherings in the evening. Sunday morning presented the most thrilling spectacle, however: the priest's round-up of the faithful for Mass contrasting with the slanderous be- havior of Senor del Rio, the hunchback and local atheist, in front of the church. For six months the narrator had remained the hunchback's secret audience and had started feeling an affinity with this outcast, until he was discovered. From then on del Rio began to pay him weekly visits, boring and simple-minded sessions of "theological instruction." The writer put up with him out of compassion and because these weekly chats relieved his solitude and kept him posted on the town's latest gossip. After more than a year, the regularity of these Sunday meetings was disrupted by the homecoming of Pablo and Juan Cordero, the sons of a local landowner, who had spent four years studying in cosmopolitan Madrid. They had left the capital only reluctantly, and their contempt for the ordinary villagers had become immediately apparent during their first, short visit to the town plaza when they ferociously mocked the priest. Considering them potential allies in his "ragged crusade for reason in the provinces," del Rio felt compelled to introduce the two</page><page sequence="4">44 Johan Callens men to the narrator, in spite of his protestations. To him, these students and del Rio represented the failure to live peacefully with one's fellow creatures, an incapacity that he thought he had conquered long ago. The confrontation proved embarrassing for del Rio, who was blatantly told off by Pablo and then asked to leave. Del Rio did not miss much, however, since the rest of the morning was spent in banalities, but henceforth the hunchback's behavior on Sundays became a little strained. Several uneventful months passed before the rumor of a miracle put an abrupt stop to these disconcerting Sunday meetings. A saint had appeared in the mountains to a shepherd tending his flock and had promised "to give absolution to the whole town" a week later on the same spot. This great news visibly affected the villagers' daily routine: there were debates, shows of religious fervor, restraint of worldly amuse- ment. For del Rio, who had broken the news to the narrator, it caused uncontrollable anger and the fear to see his lifelong convictions shattered in a single moment. When the fateful day arrived, even the writer could not resist the temptation to follow the congregation into the hills, thus breaking his promise never again to venture into the outside world. The physical weakness caused by three years of inactivity together with his bad conscience made the trip across the hills painful and demanding, but he finally reached the place where the saint had obligingly agreed to reappear. And reappear he did, blessing the peasants in poor Latin to the musi- cal accompaniment of Bach and Beethoven. Closer scrutiny revealed, however, that Pablo Cordero was "the saint," but the writer thought it wiser not to disappoint the credulous audience, unlike del Rio who burst upon the scene with a rifle, denounced the fraud, and shot the all-too-human apparition. Reacting instinctively, the peasants stoned del Rio to death. Their priest, who had remained aloof and insensitive to the writer's entreaties to intervene, blessed the bodies and sent the shaken villagers home with them, leaving Pablo's accomplice behind. The writer soon discovered Juan crouched beside his radio, in such a state of shock that he had to be told to flee. Alone in the mountains, the writer suddenly became afraid, not so much because of this collective crime but because of its consequences on the villagers' faith. In a daze he stumbled back to his room, fell asleep, and remained in a state of mental and physical exhaustion for more than twenty hours. The following day and night, from his win- dow, he watched the empty plaza and its church, waiting for the revela- tory Sunday service. He now realized that the survival of the village, and therefore his own, ultimately depended on faith. If faith was lost, the world was lost. When the congregation finally appeared on the plaza, unified under the guidance of the priest, the writer's last resistance</page><page sequence="5">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 45 was swept away for good, and he jubilantly joined the community into the church. The Initiation Scenario Whereas the conclusion of "Grace," as summarized above, suggests that the narrator has reached the final stage of some initiation process, the separate steps leading to it need to be made explicit. Before we can do so, we must remind ourselves of what is meant by initiation. The concept originated in anthropological studies concerned with allegedly primitive societies; a misunderstanding of its original meaning prevents its appropriate application to other fields such as literature. Strictly speaking, an initiation is a ritual induction into membership of a group. It is brought about by the subject's acquisition of (secret) knowledge (through indoctrination or a mystic experience) and the passing of physical and/or spiritual tests. These initiation rites are not to be equated, as Mordecai Marcus erroneously does, with puberty rites.7 Actually, there exist three categories of initiation rites: (1) puberty rites accessible to all tribe members at a given age; (2) advanced initia- tions into secret societies reserved to some tribe members; (3) individual initiations into the profession of shaman. Moreover, initiation scenarios that were originally restricted to puberty rites were applied in the course of time to ceremonies with different purposes (longevity, etc.).8 Because Marcus sets out from a restricted notion of initiation, his attempt to define the initiation story is doomed to fail; to him an initiation story may be said to show its young protagonist ex- periencing a significant change of knowledge about the world or himself, or a change of character, or of both, and this change must point or lead him towards an adult world. It may or may not contain some form of ritual, but it should give some evidence that the change is at least likely to have permanent effects.9 On the basis of these effects, Marcus then distinguishes between "tenta- tive," "uncompleted," and "decisive" initiations. Indeed, to speak of a true initiation, it is not sufficient for the process of induction to have started, though etymologically the word "initiation" is related to the Latin verb "initiare," meaning "to begin." Marcus's definition arbitrarily excludes collective initiations or the social aspect of individual ones, as well as "stories of simple recogni- tions about people and perhaps most stories about adults."10 First, Marcus chooses to ignore the primary meaning of initiation, namely, induction into membership of a group, which implies a social dimension.</page><page sequence="6">46 Johan Callens Second, any psychology primer will explain that psychological adult- hood, unlike sexual maturity (and even that may vary considerably) is not necessarily achieved at a particular age. So adults should not be excluded from the experience. Finally, the line that separates changes of knowledge or character from "recognitions about people" is elusive. Marcus is willing to consider the recognition as a true initiation when it is not (self)disparaging. However, one Joyce critic, Zack Bowen, points out that recognitions or epiphanies (the term given preference in Joyce criticism) usually reveal one's inadequacies, and he associates the con- cept with the tragic hero's recognition of his flaw, the celebrated "anagnorisis."11 We do not want to suggest that recognitions and initiations are iden- tical, only that often, as in "Grace," they cannot be separated: initia- tions can include some revelatory moment or, vice versa, recognitions can devolve into initiations,12 although not necessarily. The recognition in contemporary short stories ever so often results in a definite break with society. Besides Hassan, Paul Goetsch has rightly stressed the frequently negative outcome of modern initiations,13 but the latter assigns some functions of the initiation story to other categories of the short story. His typology consists of four types: (1) "Grenzüberschreit- ung"-stories in which a character is confronted with the irrational, located either outside or inside himself; (2) initiation stories dealing with self-discovery, the socialization of youths or moral problems; (3) revela- tion stories that converge toward some discovery at the end; and (4) the exemplary story, whose events achieve representativeness by transcend- ing the individual sphere. Goetsch's typology is totally useless in this case. Indeed, "Grace" would have to belong to some hybrid category or to possess a singular complexity, since it is offered as an exemplary tale, it features three recognition scenes, chronicles the socialization of the narrator, and in its mock apparition, parodies the genre in which boundaries are crossed. The latter type, the "Grenziiberschreitung"- story is in any case a misnomer, for initiations are also rites of passage in which "limina" are crossed. To Mircea Eliade this aspect is crucial to an understanding of the meaning and function of initiations. To him, the archaic world view is essentially a religious one. Primitive man considers the sacred as the real and powerful "par excellence." He realizes his humanity only to the extent that he gains access to the sacred. Initiation rituals in this respect perform a central function, that of opening up the sacred to the profane and the natural. This mediatory role explains the revelatory nature of initiations: to the novice is revealed the ultimate mystery of the sacred origins of human life, which includes the founding myths as well as the fertility principle. Actually, revelation is part of any kind of</page><page sequence="7">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 47 initiation, for the sacred encompasses everything: the sexuality of the adolescent, the knowledge of the new member of a secret society, the healing power of the medicine man. The sacred is the perfect whole, timeless and unlimited Being. Beginning and end coincide in it. Initia- tion rituals dramatize and at the same time offer archaic man an escape from the eternal Becoming of existence (i.e., from historicity), an escape that is realized and expressed through their death and rebirth symbolism. The novice's old self- immature, ignorant, and profane- dies and gives birth to a new self. As such, initiations achieve a true ontological muta- tion of the novice.14 This discussion about the initiation story has served a double purpose. It has warned us against reductive definitions and taxonomies, and it has given prominence to the primary components of the initiation: the (ritual) induction into membership of a group (with an individual and social aspect), the revelation of knowledge (as secular recognition or divine epiphany), the crossing of boundaries, the death and rebirth symbolism. The secondary features accompanying concrete manifesta- tions of the initiation most often relate to the ordeal quality and include, either in easily recognizable or in derived and parodied form: the initiation master, the initiation hut, the separation from the mother, the alimentary taboos, the dangerous passage, the sacred terrain (the mountain), the religious terror and trance, and the vigil. Some of these secondary ele- ments can be identified more closely as archetypal images and point to Jung's influence on Eliade. We can now chart in detail the initiation of Richardson's narrator. The first two paragraphs of "Grace" immediately establish the dominant death and rebirth symbolism. Years ago the writer decided to "with- draw from the world" and to let his friends consider him dead, but something happened that caused his "re-entrance into life" (227). This rebirth becomes the subject of a belated "literary return," a "winter renaissance" (227) that assumes the form of a Will, "the last insignifi- cant whisper of a dying man to himself- the remnant of a world which is dead and better so" (227). Death and rebirth are thus inextricably inter- woven in the story's introduction or frame, as well as in the story proper. Beginning as it does with the (re)birth of the central character, "Grace" makes the reader expect some kind of "Bildungs"-story. Yet the confusion of birth with death somehow deviates from the pattern. The story proper opens with the narrator's arrival in the obscure Spanish village and with his installation in a tiny room facing the church. This, too, constitutes an infringement upon the conventional "Bildungs"-story, in which the protagonist frequently leaves his native village in the countryside for the city. Be that as it may, the room cor- responds to the hut of primitive societies in which the novice is isolated</page><page sequence="8">48 Johan Callens before his initiation.15 The novice's isolation implies, in the case of puberty rites, a separation from the mother.16 The writer, however, has brought along a photograph of his mother and keeps sketching her fea- tures on his desk's blotter (231), which indicates the mother's lingering power over her son. The bond is broken only when he turns the picture face down before leaving his room to witness the mock apparition (251). On the surface the gesture confirms in a comic-pathetic manner the filial tie- a boy wants to hide actions of which his mother would disapprove. Beneath the surface, the gesture actualizes the break. In addition, the writer shuts his book without marking the place. Since the book is one of his own, the act announces the end of his narcissistic seclusion. This narcissism, by the way, is also expressed by the image of the mirror, the broken surface of which reflects the narrator's perturbed and frag- mented psychic world (230). Actually, the centripetal movement toward the self is soon enough transmuted into a centrifugal movement toward the community, that is, when the writer no longer focuses his attention on his room but on the town life that is visible through his window (231). By the time he observes his vigil, the writer is totally alienated from the objects in his room of which the loneliness and isolation now frighten him. The window has become the indispensable interface with life outside (261). Still, three years elapse between these two scenes, between the writer's passive and active involvement in town life, three years symbolic of an "interim existence" (249) or inauthentic death in life. In the meantime, the narrator has contact only with his landlady and, after a while, with del Rio. Both characters function as mediators be- tween the private and the public realms and are far descendants of the initiation master. Del Rio, whose primary role remains that of a scape- goat, "graces" the narrator "with a little theological instruction" that verges on the ridiculous (235). Moreover, Eliade acknowledges the link between smiths- del Rio being by profession a silversmith- and initia- tion masters.17 like miners and alchemists, smiths are credited in mytho- logical lore with the ritual power to assist nature in giving birth to raw materials and minerals (which participate in the sacredness of either Mother Earth or the immolated god/hero from whom nature originated) or in transmuting their ontological identity through the magical poten- tial of fire. Initiation masters possess similar obstetric, even soteriological, qualities, since they help the novice to be born again. Less relevant here is the more obvious fact that the professional knowledge of silversmiths, considered secret and sacred, since it grants a creative power similar to that of nature, is transmitted through initiation rituals, as is the case with most professional knowledge. But more to the point is the wide- spread mythical role of the smith as monitor or assistant in the spiritual</page><page sequence="9">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 49 formation of youths. Also, in their mythic appearance, smiths are often crippled (blind, one-eyed, or one-legged, and del Rio is a limping hunchback), which Eliade explains as the effect of initiatory mutilations or the identification mark of initiation masters. Finally, insofar as fire is an ambivalent symbol, smiths can be either good or bad. In European folklore both the Devil and Christ are encountered as "maîtres du feu," which ties in with the tragicomic resolution of the story and with Girard' s ambivalent sacred. As another initiation master besides del Rio, the landlady daily pre- pares the narrator's food. In archaic societies food and drink are usually subject to strong taboos during initiation rituals. These alimentary taboos serve a double purpose, one economic, the other spiritual. The novices are prepared for a difficult existence that, as an adult, they must carry on alone, independent of their parents. Also they learn the religious origins and sacred value of food. Often the novices fast in imitation of the dead whom they symbolically join during their initiation.18 Richard- son parodies this customary asceticism: in the beginning of his retreat, the narrator gains weight (231) and at the end he is almost too weak to follow the peasants into the mountains (251). The latter example also parodies the biblical parable about the lame who walks sustained by his faith, since the narrator manages to follow the procession driven by curiosity and the certainty that reason will triumph. The trip into the mountains resembles the archetypal "dangerous passage." Following the example of the tribal god or mythic ancestors, the novice has to undertake a journey into the world beyond, during which he has to pass several tests, chief among which is that of the labyrinth.19 The journey metaphor is introduced by the writer himself when he decides no longer to watch the night festivities on the plaza: "In this way, I thought I could fight the temptation of forming another nexus with life and aid my enfeebled will to keep me on the narrow road leading to my long awaited death" (242). The image gives the impres- sion of an initiation period full of trials and mortifications. Crucial among them is the literal trip into the mountains. On the way up, the writer experiences terrible fatigue, made bearable only by a touch of self -irony ("if any miracle was to happen that day it would be that I had managed to make this journey," 252). On the way down, "through the maze of stone and clay" (260; emphasis added), fear of the consequences of the double murder aggravates the writer's physical exhaustion. In a sense, the writer's journey starts with his move to Spain and the trip to the mountains is a quest within the quest, a pilgrimage to the center of the world, for the mountain, where the drama of "Grace" is enacted, figures as the symbolic center of the universe, the privileged spot where mediations between this and that world- heaven or hell-</page><page sequence="10">50 Johan Callens become possible.20 Richardson's parodistic intentions do not detract from the appropriateness, the symbolic value of some details. It is fitting that del Rio should enjoy a short-lived triumph at the foot of this moun- tain. The narrator explicitly associates him with the devil who is reputed to live "below": he calls del Rio "this ridiculous little Satan" (237) in whose presence he feels "stifled by mephitic air" (247) and considers him the partial cause of a "diabolical disaster" (263). Through his limp and (silver)smith profession, del Rio is once again assigned an abode within mountains or the underworld.21 It is equally fitting that Pablo should stage his "pseudo-theophany" (254) on top of a hill and that, after the double murder, the narrator has a revelation there, with which his initiation enters its final phase. Since the gods are believed to reside "above," that is, in the heavens, promontories are ideal places for them to descend to earth and for privileged people to ascend to heaven, to get in touch with the gods or to receive divine revelations. The recognition scene on top of the mountain is actually the second, though the most interesting, of its kind. The narrator experiences three revelations in all, the first taking place while del Rio is gleefully recounting the joke that Pablo and Juan played on the priest, the third at the end of the narrator's vigil. These scenes mark decisive stages of the initiation. They function as pivots around which the story reorients itself and thus fulfill their structural role in a much more efficient and organic way than the repeated time references and the remarkably similar-looking transi- tions to new developments within the story (things continue in their usual way until something happens that causes a change: 239, 243, 247-48). By themselves, these transitions would soon enough turn "Grace" into a tedious affair, as Richardson elsewhere flippantly calls chronicles of conversion.22 However, the conspicuousness of these transi- tions allows us to interpret them as metafictional markers of the structure inherent in "Bildungs"-fiction. Their mechanical nature bespeaks their conventional role as a scaffolding for the narrator's moral evolution. In the first recognition scene, the narrator compares his former self to del Rio and the two brothers. He senses that all the years I thought possessed of certain noble elements, had been really infected by a strange incapacity- an incapacity no dif- ferent from that of an untutored cripple to live peacefully with his betters or that of the two young students who found it politic to humiliate a harmless and no doubt kind individual. (242-43) This first "self-appraisal" (245), with its moralizing and philanthropic message, brings closer the writer's initiation into the community, but his lingering pride, betrayed by the discomfort that follows the exposure</page><page sequence="11">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 51 of his own incapacity, puts it off for a while. His "Bildung" is not yet completed. This frequently cynical pride is one of the narrator's most obvious characteristics, evidence of which abounds: there is the smug- ness in his personification of the world and the assumption that this world cared to be on good terms with him (228); his presumption, openly admitted (230), of being able to force life and death; his contempt for del Rio's simple-mindedness (236); the conceited generosity with which he allows the peasants to enjoy "the benefits of God's weekly blessing" (233). Part of the writer's initiation consists in the Socratic process of learning to know himself (knowledge comes largely in revela- tory flashes during the recognition scenes) and to curb the exaggerated pride that caused his cynical retreat in the face of misfortune (263). The humility with which the writer minimalizes the usefulness of his life- story, at its beginning, is really the final stage of his reeducation as well as the beginning of the writing process. The positive effects of the first recognition scene soon appear. Before his dreaded meeting with del Rio and the Corderos, the narrator feels like waving at the priest, as if he wanted to show where his true allegiances lie (244). Perhaps he wants to imitate the villagers who, unlike del Rio and the students, pay the priest a great deal of respect. Perhaps he already en- vies the happiness they derive from their faith (247). The meeting ends with the students' sudden and uncourteous departure. Instead of letting his anger at their rudeness carry him away, the narrator is pleased with this proof of their dislike of him, for he wants to dissociate himself as much from del Rio as from them: "As long as they believed me to be a few cuts above del Rio, I took their dislike as a compliment. My values were at last in their proper order" (247). More hints of the writer's grow- ing integration are given in connection with the shepherd's brief ap- pearance in town. Witnessing this appearance from the window of his room, the narrator feels "cheated of some important news" (248), as though he were sufficiently part of the community now to feel entitled to the man's message, like the peasants, the narrator senses the growing in- tensity as the prospective miracle nears, and his landlady, who had barely spoken a word in the past, now chats with him for hours on end (249). During the events leading up to the second recognition, other en- couraging signs are given. Although he pierces the identity of the mock saint, the writer lets the deception linger instead of intruding "into the lives of people I neither knew nor belonged to in any way" (254). He thus demonstrates his growing humaneness and concern for his fellow creatures, including del Rio: shame immediately follows his initial satis- faction with the hunchback's gullibility (254). However, the writer's failure to prevent first Pablo's and then del Rio's death, exhibits once again his deeper incapacity and postpones his initiation.</page><page sequence="12">52 Johan Callens The second recognition scene echoes the incapacity theme of the first but gains in intensity through the impact of the double murder. It pro- vides an important variation upon the conventional meaning of such scenes, for while the first recognition scene supplies a clear insight, the second presents itself as a riddle. Of course, the enigma repeats, on a mental level, the test of the physical labyrinth. We quote the paragraph in full because of its crucial role within the story and because of its very Jamesian, that is, roundabout, cumulative, and intricate style, almost melodramatic for the "extravagance" and the "intensity of moral claim impinging on the[ir] characters] '[s] consciousness":23 Finding myself completely alone, I started down the side of the hill leading to the village. I had just achieved the first step of level ground when, shall I call it the inertia, the emotional inertia which had caused me to act instinctively for the first time in my life, ceased, and the full import of what had happened lay like a tangled puzzle in front of me. A puzzle that had to be solved, and quickly; for with this cessation of instinctive action came an emotion which I had managed, with little difficulty, to subdue during my active life and interim existence. This feeling, this actual physical disorder I now had, was brute fear. What the realization that I was impotent as a man and as an artist had failed to produce; what the decision to die had been incapable of causing; what the revelation of the meaning, or lack of it, in my past life had only hinted at, this morning's melo- drama, farce and tragedy had accomplished. I was afraid, and the worst of it was I understood that the feeling I experienced was a result, not of what had happened, but of the effects these happen- ings would induce. I was afraid of something that had not yet taken place, but had been, in a certain sense, presaged by the events I had witnessed. (259) By withholding the cause or object of this fear- the eventual collapse of the community's faith- Richardson manages to delay the story's climax and to sustain the reader's curiosity for another five pages. His delaying tactics are further served by the double negation (the "emo- tional inertia . . . ceased"), the analytic tendency (actions, emotions, and thoughts are set apart), the recapitulations and enumerations ("What the realization ... ; what the decision ... ; what the revela- tion;" "this morning's melodrama, farce and tragedy"). During initiations novices are subject to a religious terror, partly a vague feeling of danger attending any religious act, partly a specific fear of the confrontation with the gods to whom they are symbolically immolated and by whom they are subsequently resurrected. These</page><page sequence="13">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 53 strong emotions should be considered initiation tests, a way of conquer- ing the fear of one's own, real death.24 In "Grace" the narrator fears not so much a display of divine power as the loss of human faith. Yet in archaic rituals, there exists a variant of the religious terror, namely, the religious fever or trance that indicates that one is temporarily possessed by a divinity or that one acquires magic-religious powers.25 At first sight the narrator's exaltation before joining the procession into the moun- tains seems only due to the general excitement and the disruption of normal behavior, his "unsensible condition" upon his return to his physical and mental exhaustion. We must, however, also take into account the narrator's long unconsciousness, his subsequent vigil, and the hallucinations that transform it into a real nightmare. These may be a far echo of Eliade's religious trances, but their connotation remains the same: the troublesome passage from one state of being to another, from the writer's moribund impotence to the community's life-sustain- ing power and faith. Upon this communal faith the narrator's life seems to depend: if it is strong enough to survive the test of a collective crisis, it should be worth confessing. This dilemma forms the core of the third recognition scene to which the vigil leads: Could [the villagers] go on, I wondered, even after yesterday's cruel assault? For if they could not, I knew there was no basis, no pristine rhythm of life which could continue on and on, perhaps unrewarded and unfulfilled, but nevertheless unscathed by weaker spirits who howled nonsense at an insensitive universe. (262-63) This clear denunciation of the popular absurdist argument as a flimsy cover for human weakness, apparently indicates that the writer has abandoned his marginal position and committed himself to the commu- nity, as long as it does not give up its faith. In the course of three recog- nition scenes, he appears to have realized the weakness of his own posi- tion, so that he can now profess his allegiance to the "strong" position of the others. The narrator's vigil (with the attendant anxiety) then functions as a final test of his physical and spiritual strength.26 If he passes it, just as the community has to pass its own test, he ought to be worthy of inte- gration. The vigil also prolongs the Christian symbolism and resumes the death and rebirth pattern. The drama in the mountains has indeed been described as a "distorted passion play" (257). Since it takes place on a Friday, the vigil on Saturday night, and the rebirth on Sunday, the events parallel Christ's death on Holy Friday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. Our sense of an ending and a new beginning is further</page><page sequence="14">54 Johan Callens enhanced when we remember that the Christians tried to assimilate Easter (which falls on the Sunday after the first full moon of March) to the Jewish Pesach, which took place historically on the eve of the four- teenth Nissan, the first spring moon, originally also the first month of the year. Moreover, archaic New Year celebrations often include the ritual extinction of fires to symbolize the annihilation of the old year and a return to the original darkness and chaos from which time and space, the four dimensions of the cosmos, are re-created. In view of del Rio 's association with fire through his profession, his death fits the New Year symbolism. Eliade insists upon primitive man's conviction that during archaic New Year celebrations everything is born for the first time, not just reborn.27 A similar conviction emerges from the narrator's self- examination in which the death and rebirth symbolism culminate: I asked myself in a loud voice; "Do you really wish to resume life?" Then, almost laughing, I replied: "Resume life? I have never known the meaning of the word. I want to begin life, now!" And then incapability's advocate: "But you came here to die." Then I: "Yes, but the necessary condition for death is life. You are refuted my infernal self. Your logic will not hold against the strength filing into that church. They have had their crisis and gone on. I shall try and do the same." (263-64) The narrator's resolve marks the end of his novitiate, and there seems no doubt about the "decisiveness" of his initiation, even though it takes him the symbolic seven years to publicize it, but then not without a certain pride: "I have been accepted here. I belong. And, at last, I need no more than that" (264). Existentialist Themes and Metafictional Subversion In the foregoing analysis of "Grace" as an initiation story, a number of typically existentialist themes have arisen: boredom and preoccupation with death, alienation and commitment (belonging), anxiety and the feeling of human finitude, absurdity and the joyful protest against it. The boredom that sends the narrator off to Spain is not an ordinary psychology-based feeling, in this case one of disinterest, of being bored with something in a particular situation. Rather it is an "ontological" feeling, a "state-of-mind mak[ing] manifest 'how one is."'28 The nar- rator's boredom is symptomatic of his refusal- Sartre would call it "bad faith"- to live up to his human potential and of his satisfaction with an inauthentic life.29 Heidegger subsumes ontological boredom under the concept of "falling," which he characterizes as man's absorption in the</page><page sequence="15">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 55 world and the others to the detriment of his or her self-realization. Only those states of mind in which Dasein relinquishes the homeliness and familiarity of everyday, fallen Being-in-the-world and confronts itself, secure an authentic life.30 If the "uncanny" homelessness of authentic Being, as described by Heidegger, seems to suggest that it is "alienated," we must immediately add that he uses the term "alienation" to characterize fallen or inau- thentic Being. The latter is distinguished not only by man's involvement with the world and the others but also by his "exaggerated 'self-dissec- tion,' " by a "self-entanglement" that turns him away from the ground of his Being.31 As we have seen, this narcissistic condition is that of the narrator of "Grace." All the same, Heidegger's notion of authentic Being as constituted by a turning away from the "They," implies an alienation in the common sense, that of relinquishing social life, which is conspicuous in "Grace." The different characteristics of human existence (self-consciousness, Being-in-the-world, and Being-with-others) account for the varied con- crete ways in which the narrator is alienated. First, he is described as a "refugee" (230), an exile from his native country and an outsider to the Spanish community. Second, toward the end of his "interim-existence" (249, 259) or death in life, the narrator loses all control over his body and follows the procession into the hills, no matter what reasons militate against doing so. He felt "like talking to another person- a person who didn't care in the least about my opinions or advice. My mind mocked and derided my action but the action went on" (250-51). And finally, during his vigil the narrator becomes estranged from the objects of his room. The immediate cause for this sudden increase of alienation is the double murder. The deeper cause has to do with the emotion that seizes the narrator on top of the hill and that existentialists designate by the terms "anxiety," "anguish," or "dread." Anxiety, like boredom, is considered an ontological emotion, revelatory of the human condition, hence its appropriateness at the climax of the second recognition scene. By withholding the immediate object of the narrator's distress, Richard- son does more than maintain the reader's curiosity. He indicates that this distress should be understood as existential anxiety. The meaning of anxiety differs slightly from one existentialist to another, yet with the exception perhaps of Camus, it plays a crucial role for everyone. Kierkegaard, who introduced the concept, considers it man's consciousness of his infinite freedom, which is terrible and en- ticing at the same time. It implies the possibility of individual sin as well as the effect of original sin. As a corollary, it is the precondition of faith, which simultaneously explains the infinite to man and saves him from</page><page sequence="16">56 Johan Callens the finite material world and from the dread before the infinite.32 In this ambivalent sense, the notion somehow fits "Grace." On the one hand, anxiety uncovers the narrator's "incapacity" at the heart of the first and second recognition scenes, the in-built imperfection of innocence remi- niscent of Kierkegaard's original sin (as well as of the tragic flaw). On the other hand, the narrator's anxiety betrays his responsibility for the collective crime: as though he suddenly saw his noninvolvement from the Sartrean perspective, not as the inability but as the deliberate refusal to prevent the murders. His anxious guilt becomes an illustration of what Kierkegaard calls the "teleological suspension of the ethical," that is, the need to act in an immoral way so as to pass from the ethical to the religious stage of existence.33 This interpretation ties in with our earlier claim that the narrator's initiation is a rite of passage, in this case, from innocence to sin. Heidegger defines anxiety as the most elementary state of mind, since, in it, Dasein is disclosed to itself. Like Kierkegaard before and Sartre after him, he distinguishes anxiety from fear for "a detrimental entity within-the- world which comes from some definite region" because it is an anxiety for "nothing and no where- within-the- world."34 Whereas in boredom, a mode of falling, "we find ourselves ... in the midst of what-is-in-totality, wholly pervaded by it," anxiety discloses Nothing, that is, the complete "negation" or "withdrawal of what-is-in-totality," the existent included.35 As a result, whoever experiences anxiety is "in suspense" because he loses the support of what-is and feels sucked into the "nihilating" vortex of "the vanishing what-is-in-totality."36 The latter two sensations fairly well characterize the narrator's ex- perience during the second recognition scene, which withholds its object from the readers and keeps them "in suspense" through Jamesian stylistic devices. Heidegger's secular concept of anxiety can also be reconciled with the "religious terror" with which we have compared the narrator's fear, and which involves, according to Eliade, the novice's consciousness of his imminent (symbolic or real) death and a total loss of differentiation.37 The shocking image of the two murders that haunts the narrator transforms the abstract possibility of death, which at first he could serenely reflect upon, into a vivid reality, that of a vortex threatening not only him but the whole community with annihilation. The crucial distinction, for the narrator as well as for Heidegger, is that between death as an eventual and vague "public occurrence" to others, and death as a personal (i.e., "nonrelational") and certain experience, definitely affecting me now. Insofar as the latter ends my very existence, it is the ultimate possibility, "not to be outstripped," which I must be aware of, no matter how "dreadful," to secure an authentic existence.38 Actually, this distinction has already been conspicuously dramatized</page><page sequence="17">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 57 when the otherwise so rational narrator starts panicking at the thought that del Rio might murder him during his first visit (235). Camus makes the same distinction, although he merely subsumes anxiety under the experience of the absurd, defined as the permanent awareness of the abyss between man and the world.39 He indeed objects to the cultivation of anxiety for its own sake as the supreme ontological feeling or state of consciousness.40 It is a stage to be surpassed. This does not mean that Camus opts for Kierkegaard's tortured religious solution to anxiety. In Le mythe de Sisyphe and L'homme révolté, as well as in "Grace," anxiety turns into joy, into the smile of the rebel against absurdity.41 Combining Kierkegaard and Heidegger, Sartre interprets anxiety in L'être et le néant as the questioning mode of the free "pour-soi" which automatically entails Nothingness as the possibility of not-Being for what is questioned (whether the "pour-soi" or the "en-soi").42 Insofar as man's essence is precisely to lack an essence and to be forced forever to re-create one, anxiety is a bitter corollary of freedom.43 The flight from this freedom and its inevitable anxiety, into the material world that a human being deterministically submits to as though he or she were an object ("en-soi"), Sartre then labels "bad faith." Or in more philo- sophical terms, bad faith is the impossible attempt of the "pour-soi" to coincide with itself, like the "en-soi"; it is an impossible attempt, since a person's essence is precisely to lack one, to be constituted by his or her project, what he or she is not yet.44 This mistaken attempt to equate the "pour-soi" with the "en-soi" is the existential meaning of the Romantic image in which the narrator compares himself to a forgotten letter. A slightly different, if more accessible, exposition of anxiety is to be found in Sartre's L'existentialisme est un humanisme.45 There, anxiety becomes the precondition of action.46 Acting means choosing one pos- sibility out of many, as well as taking the responsibility for that choice. Defined in this way, anxiety is the consequence of humanity's freedom, which Sartre calls "délaissement," after Heidegger's "Geworfenheit." "Délaissement" means that one is thrown into this world and for better or for worse forced to rely on oneself instead of on God or "a priori" values.47 If we are born free to Sartre, we nonetheless have a personal and social responsibility to assume. First, we must realize our freedom, that is, fulfill our project and commit ourselves. Second, in doing so we must uphold an exemplary image of man.48 Anxiety follows man's awareness of this double, personal and social, responsibility, unless one is guilty of "bad faith," which means that one evades this responsibility.49 The idea of man's social responsibility is actually a qualification of Sartre's earlier, much criticized, claim that</page><page sequence="18">58 Johan Callens one not only has to give meaning to a contingent world but that one also has to make up one's values whenever acting or manifesting one's freedom, which engenders a specific kind of "ethical" anxiety.50 Seen from this Sartrean perspective, the narrator of "Grace" falls a victim to anxiety in the third recognition scene because he realizes that at this point he has to choose between the villagers who represent a new life and the Cordero brothers who represent his former life. In addition, he realizes that the villagers in turn must choose for or against their faith, and given the social function of this faith- it unified them against del Rio- a definite social responsibility is involved, more clearly than in the narrator's case. At this point we need to distinguish more explicitly between "secular" and "religious" existentialism. If relative self-fulfillment is possible, religious existentialists argue, it must reside in some transcendental power. Kierkegaard therefore urges man to seize the benefit of the doubt and risk the "leap of faith," to believe in the existence of what is beyond rational or objective proof- God, grace, whatever- and to surrender to it.51 This is Pascal's wager all over again: better believe in God than not, for the infinite gains (eternal salvation, etc.), should He exist, surely exceed the finite losses should He not. William James, on whom Richardson lectured while doing post- graduate work on the existentialists in Munich,52 also used this argu- ment when building his case in favor of faith. He reasoned that when the evidence about God's existence is inconclusive and our faith serves a personal need, we have a right to believe.53 This is the weak and more sensible version of James's argument. The strong, voluntaristic and harder to defend, version of James's argument claims that we must take the risk of believing without adequate evidence in order to gather that very evidence.54 James substitutes belief in God for God, as Russell formulates it, and humanizes or psychologizes religion,55 sidestepping in the process its institutional and doctrinal aspects.56 Given Richardson's knowledge of pragmatism, it is not surprising to find among the existentialist features of "Grace" some related, prag- matic ones. According to James, the value of a belief depends on its usefulness for human life, or a belief is true when its effects for man are good.57 Granting the limitations of this principle's application to beliefs and not to verifiable facts, which depend on anterior causes,58 we can see its appeal to the narrator of "Grace." Religion is "true" because it is to his own advantage and that of the villagers. It helps him to live in peace and harmony with his fellow creatures (i.e., the pacifistic message of the first recognition scene, anticipatory of The Prodigal and Lorenzo), and it helps the community to survive attacks from detractors and the discord they cause. Operating from these pragmatic assumptions shared</page><page sequence="19">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 59 by the religious existentialists, even archaic ontologies expect the novice to conquer alienation, death, and Nothingness by crossing the line into the sacred world. Secular existentialists like Sartre deny, however, the possibility of transcending the boundaries of human existence. Self- fulfillment is possible, if limited and always to be renewed, for those willing to assume full responsibility for their actions in this world. Both secular and religious existentialists agree, nonetheless, about the need to face anxiety as a condition for an authentic existence. Man must not give in to Nothingness, either by remaining passive or by killing himself, the only two options initially open to our mistaken narrator.59 If fact, these options are one and the same misguided choice, if we may believe Camus' s claim in Le mythe de Sisyphe (1942) that suicide is an extreme form of acceptance.60 And in an interview granted before the publication of L'homme révolté (1951), he added that the absurd experience must not be a dead end but should be surpassed in a fruitful revolt.61 This revolt against the essential meaninglessness in the face of death consists in rebelling, in continuing to live and thus endowing human life with grandeur and relative meaning. The message is, like that of Sisyphus, to love life with all its limitations and drawbacks, to display the same Dionysian "Amor Fati" as Nietzsche and to move beyond nihilism, without for that matter having recourse to metaphysical con- solations.62 The two-step movement described by Camus and Nietzsche clearly corresponds to that of "Grace," from early pessimism, through con- secutive recognitions to a final life-affirmation, that is, Eliade's death and rebirth pattern. What is more, it is definitely a tragicomic movement resulting in a V-shaped structure like that of the medieval miracle plays, alternately called Saints' or conversion plays, of which "Grace" offers a modern variation. Of course, the tragicomedy is not only reflected in the story's structure but also in its black humor. The narrator's resolve to die here functions as a continuing source of morbid jokes: to take an example, del Rio's tirade against a benevolent God "was like an invita- tion from life to begin all over again" (236), weakening the narrator's resolve, which he renews by asking del Rio how many villagers died last year (238). In addition, the story shares with the medieval dramatic tradi- tion an allegorical tendency, witness the vagueness of its temporal and geographical location and the personifications of the world ("For some twenty years we had gotten along well together, the world and I," 228), life ("I believed that since I was through with life, desired a divorce, so to speak, life would be through with me," 230), and death (when seeing del Rio's face for the first time, the narrator reflects that he "had never expected death to look so out and out mediaeval," 235). "Grace" therefore clearly anticipates both the Preface to Gallows</page><page sequence="20">60 Johan Callens Humor, with its justification of the tragicomic form, and the play's adaptation of the morality form. The narrator (and Richardson) make(s) certain that the reference to the medieval tradition does not go un- heeded. Perhaps not too much should be made of the detail that the village church is built in the Romanesque style, though it could be taken as a submerged historical reference to the conflict between faith and reason, theologians and dialecticians, that tore apart the eleventh cen- tury and that is at the heart of "Grace."63 A related explanation can be given for the reference to Abélard (1079-1142), the medieval theologian who managed to reconcile reason and faith. Less submerged and singular are the allusions to the medieval dramatic tradition. We have already mentioned the conversion, tragicomic structure, and allegorical influence; what with the comparison of del Rio to the devil, a stock figure of the morality, the mock epiphany, and the bitter comedy of evil or "distorted passion play" (257) enacted in the hills, with the sensational end of its evil characters and the ultimate triumph of good. As a matter of fact, the story is studded with dramatic metaphors. Examples abound: "cast," "improvisation," and "spectacle" (232), "performance" and "characters" (233), "audience" (237), "theater" (246), and "theatrically" (260), "scene" (257), "melodrama, farce and tragedy" (259), and "stage" (261). This dramatic vocabulary is proof of the self-consciousness of the narrator/writer. Together with the past tenses, it maintains toward the partly narrated/partly enacted events the aesthetic distance already established in the frame by the act of retro- spective writing. The aesthetic distance and self-consciousness keep qualifying the narrator's integration into the community. In addition, the vocabulary attests to a theatricalization of everyday life that Richard- son later develops into the metatheater of The Prodigal and Lorenzo. At worst, it can be taken as proof that the narrator has created a mental world, separate from the real one, as the result of his self-imprisonment in his room. And like every true playwright, he not only writes the plot but directs the actors and plays a part in it. The charge of subjectivism is first supported by the narrator's hope, or is it belief, that he dreamed the deaths of Pablo Cordero and del Rio (260). Second, it is enhanced by the paradoxical but common enough compensation of the protagonist's incapacity to live by a creative faculty. Last but not least, the opening of "Grace," which, as we remarked, follows chronologically upon the narrator's so-called initiation, stresses his subjectivism. The equivocal terms in which his "story" is announced as well as the allusions to myths and tales suggest total fictionality, the possibility that not the events described in the story caused the nar- rator's rebirth but the very act of writing that story:</page><page sequence="21">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 61 I feel I owe an explanation for my reappearance. Not that I am obliged to anyone in particular- I have long since denied myself the pleasure of particulars- rather it is more that I sense a general explanation is in order. At least an explanation to myself and whoever might find these words of interest. First then, let me say that what has caused my winter renaissance is a story, and though this may seem a pale excuse for again intruding upon a world which is constantly being handed one myth, one tale after the other, I rely on the sympathies of those who understand the force which a few related events can have upon our lives, and even those who understand may be disappointed that / return not with new absolutes or effulgent visions, but with a story so small and pe- culiar to my own life that it may well have little or no meaning to those who are fashioning an existence with other theorems, rules and first prin- ciples. In fact there is a possibility, a strong possibility, that the only person who will benefit from my quiet literary return will be I, and that this "I" is not really worth the effort. (227; emphasis added) "Grace" thus combines the traditional and popular meanings of "myth," that of a fiction or fable and of an etiological narrative, a story relating how something came into being (i.e., how Eliade interprets the term, too). It is an instance of contemporary autobiography that, instead of merely describing, analyzing, or expressing an absolute preexisting self- as is the case for its historical, philosophical, and poetic modes distinguished by William C. Spengemann- in addition continually has to (re)create that self, whether by individual actions (the existentialist viewpoint) and/or fictional means (the metafictional one). Under these circumstances, autobiography becomes a paradoxical genre, "both impossible and unavoidable. Without a self, one cannot write about it, but whatever one writes about will be about the self it constructs."64 Besides assigning "Grace" to the general category of contemporary autobiography for the reasons just mentioned, we may, by the same token, consider it a variation in short story form of what Steven G. Kellman calls the "self-begetting" novel, that is: an account, usually first-person, of the development of a character to the point at which he is able to take up his pen and compose the novel we have just finished reading. Like an infinite recession of Chinese boxes, the self-begetting novel begins again where it ends.65 As in the "self-begetting novel," the paradigm of which is Marcel Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu (1913-27), a blend of Bildungsroman</page><page sequence="22">62 Johan Callens and Künstlerroman, the stress in "Grace" is on the writer's consciousness and development rather than on the fictionality of his output.66 Kell- man's description neatly catches the repetitiousness of the writer's and reader's act, which complements the repetitiousness of the narrated and mythical death and rebirth pattern. As such, "Grace" anticipates the double repetitiousness- that of the discourse and that of the story- of "The Credence Table," The Prodigal, and Lorenzo, but most of all of Memoir of a Gambler, ending as it does with the narrator's impending homecoming, since in both the self-begetting novel and the spiritual autobiography, "the protagonist's transformation compels him to return to us in the Cave with an account of his conversion. He must re-create his experiences by putting them into words."67 Unfortunately, no sooner is the subject affirmed in print than it becomes a fiction be- cause of the narrative context. The character automatically displaces the author. This autobiographical catch offers a limpid analogy to the exis- tentialist view of the self as a constantly renewable project. A realization of the "self-begetting" nature of "Grace" throws new light on the death and rebirth symbolism of the opening, as well as on some other features of the story. According to Kellman, the self-begetting novel begets both a self and itself. It recounts the creation of a work very much like itself, but it is also the portrait of a fictive artist being born. Like so much art of the past two centuries, it is a self-portrait: self-portrait not just in the sense of the portrait of a self, as with Van Gogh's myriad studies of Van Gogh, but a por- trait of the portrait itself. The self-begetting hero typically occupies center stage throughout this drama, and the story is, in several important senses, his story. It is literature as self-expression, and the acquisition of a name be- comes an epic accomplishment for the author-protagonist. ... It is the book that becomes incarnation of the hero who grows up to write it and thereby earn a name for himself. . . . The protagonist is typically solitary and single, yet his efforts are depicted as termi- nating in personal rebirth.68 Thus, the unnamed narrator's alienation from his native country is a deliberate declaration of autonomy. On the one hand, the continuous sketches of his mother's portrait are a truly "autogenetic" act, the son's attempt to sire his own mother, an act paralleled by his alter ego, He- phaistos/del Rio, whose mother, Hera, conceived him, according to Hesiod's genealogy, without male intervention.69 On the other hand, no mention is made of the narrator's father, for the goal of his self- creative act includes becoming father to himself. The connotative field</page><page sequence="23">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 63 of the broken mirror image therefore expands to include not only frag- mentation and interiorization but also the traditional self-reflection; the self-begetting novel is indeed a "fantasy of Narcissus become autogamous."70 The interpretation of "Grace" as a "self-begetting" story, initially inspired by the dramatic vocabulary, is diametrically opposed to the suggested integration at its end. This is rather typical of metafiction, says Patricia Waugh, for the reader is always presented with embedded strata which con- tradict the presuppositions of the strata immediately above or below. The fictional content of the story is continually reflected by its formal existence as text, and the existence of that text within a world viewed in terms of "textuality."71 Still, the ultimately metaphorical nature of the dramatic vocabulary in this narrative text remains quite obvious, which weakens the suspicion of total narcissism. This metaphorical nature of the dramatic vocabulary must be kept in mind when studying those plays in which the dramatic genre may treacherously endow the Ur-metaphor of the world as a stage and life as a play with more reality than it actually possesses. This is expecially true of Lorenzo, which brings on stage actors and almost fuses reality and illusion, only to show the detrimental effects of such fusion. With regard to the story's conclusion, another problem remains to be dealt with. If the narrator's life affirmation coincides with his conversion to the Catholic church, his position does not, for that matter, coincide with that of the religious existentialists, as the parodistic religious vocabulary and the metafictionally betrayed unorthodoxy of this posi- tion indicate. Some examples of the ironically religious vocabulary are: "schism" (230), "sanctuary" (235), "Antichrist" (237), "crusade" (238), "Provi- dence" (251), and "predestined hill" (252). The narrator's reference to "the obvious chasm existing between the Protestant chorale," the hymn by Bach played on the radio during the second recognition scene, "and the expected Catholic miracle" (253) shows not only his erudition but is Richardson's metafictional way of drawing attention to the unortho- doxy of his narrator's position. His early Protestant concern with indi- vidual salvation indeed keeps informing his conversion to Catholicism in the admission that his story (a first-person narrative) possesses only relevance to himself (227), unless this is taken as evidence of the speaker's newly gained Christian or supradenominational humility. Of course, the idiosyncratic positions of religious existentialists, whether Karl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, or Miguel de Unamuno, equally prevent us</page><page sequence="24">64 Johan Callens from relegating them to any single denomination without further qualification. If we take Kierkegaard as an example of religious existentialism, the supposed relation to God requires detachment from the world and the others, whereas the narrator's conversion entails his initiation into the community. Moreover, Kierkegaard's leap of faith presupposes a strong conviction about the existence of a God and a hereafter. The narrator never goes that far. At the end of the third recognition scene, he admits that the villagers' faith may remain "perhaps unrewarded and unful- filled" (263). Similarly, the story's full title, "In the Final Year of Grace," indicates that the narrator has no illusions about a hereafter. Death is final to him. Since we have taken Kirkegaard as our example of religious existen- tialism, we should add that the narrator's conversion has not been a leap of faith, a surrender to the irrational forces in the manner of Kierkegaard, either. The point needs to be made because existentialism has frequently been charged with irrationalism. The existentialists' "irrationalism" was a reaction against the de- humanization (of technology, bureaucracy, mass art and media) as the result of an excessively one-sided rational approach to existence. At the same time, it meant to reevaluate the concrete, whole individual (with its conscious and unconscious, pleasant and unpleasant aspects such as death, anxiety, guilt, etc.) and not just epistemological man who seeks to apprehend intellectually.72 This "holistic" yearning is shared with primitive man as described by Eliade and, pending the metafic- tional subversion, suffuses Richardson's tragicomic initiatory story. It is true that the narrator abandons his early skepticism or systematic doubt (at one time he had relished and admired "the arguments of the urban and witty sceptics," 236) which, through its leveling power, had been partly responsible for his existential boredom. He relinquishes his "excessive" rationalism, reflected in his belief that his early decision to die "was humane and civilized" merely "because it was logical" (229), a belief reminiscent of Socrates' moral rationalism and of his rather naive view that knowledge makes men virtuous. Nowhere in "Grace" is there evidence, however, that the narrator has totally given up "the rational control [he] had spent a life time in building" (229). His balanced (ultimately tragicomic) attitude toward reason finally resembles that of Camus, who recognizes the limits of reason without, for that matter, relinquishing it.73 The experience of the absurd precisely consists of the encounter between human reason and the irrational. And one has to remain conscious of both opposites in order to preserve the equilibrium of an authentic existence.74 As external</page><page sequence="25">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 65 evidence for Richardson's balanced assessment of reason's powers, we quote his warm appreciation of Samuel Johnson, a man of reason who, as much as Hume, knew reason's limits. Death, sin, the consolations of Christianity were matters on which pure intellect could not pass judgement, and for Johnson this meant that all that was significant in human existence must be shadowed by doubt. The celebration of the mind that for so many of his con- temporaries meant celebrating a rational universe, meant for John- son just the opposite. . . . whenever Johnson slaps down polite learning's attempt to tidy up life, he is swearing fealty to disin- terested thought, to the mind whose greatest virtue is to suffer its own boundaries. . . . Despite his doubts and fears, Johnson felt it a duty never to capitulate to chaos or to undermine the order that civilization gives to life. Like Camus and Richardson, Johnson would have refused to give in to "the latest fashions in despair and anarchy," opposing them with the human qualities of "common sense, moral courage, intellectual self- respect." These men share "the courage to believe in reason while accepting its limitations."75 Internal proof of the narrator's lingering rationalism resides in the story's decorous, intellectual style, the heritage of his former academic profession76- witness the rather elaborate sentences with figures, the recurring French expressions, and the metafictional literary allusions. That the solemnity is often tainted by a tone of mockery, as though the story's subject did not warrant such elevated style, does not really alter the case, though it is constant evidence of Richardson's parodistic inten- tions. Recalling his early days before he moved to Spain, when passions held his attention and ideas sent him wandering through the streets at night (228), the narrator has recourse to a subtle cross-figure (one ex- pects ideas to hold the attention and passions to send people wandering the streets) that perfectly conveys the ascendance in him of ideas over feelings, or better, the entanglement of the two. And just as the narrator before his conversion resisted the irrationality of his dreams (242, 262) and of apparitions (249), he refuses to repeat del Rio's account of the joke Pablo and Juan pulled on the village priest because the hunchback's "excitement was so intense that it completely removed any semblance of logic from his report" (241). Examples of the consistent French vocabulary are "final reposoir" (22), "en route" (232), "cortège" and "homme de trop" (233), "con- frere" (236), "danse macabre" (238), "au contraire" and "rendezvous"</page><page sequence="26">66 Johan Callens (239), and "salon" (243). The narrator also pokes fun at the descriptive obsession of the French "nouveau roman," its exaggerated preoccupa- tion with externals, when he remarks that "only the French would have the audacity, bad eminence and enough charm to record in writing [the] thousand minute observations [he had made] about the articles in [his] room" (231). Yet the extent to which Alain Robbe-Grillet, one of the major spokesmen of the "nouveau roman," insists on the "presence" of the material world, in the traditional novel made transparent and neglected in favor of some signified or essence beyond (metaphysical, social, or psychological), corresponds to the existentialists' (or should we say phenomenologists') rehabilitation of concrete existence.77 The elaborate symbolism of "Grace" is of course something Robbe-Grillet would thoroughly deplore. On the other hand, by considering the con- cept of the Absurd another transcendental essence, he echoes the critique that the existentialists are guilty of a new essentialism (whether of anxiety or the absurd).78 The new novel's so-called elimination of the subject was a reaction against an excessive anthropocentrism, a cutting down of the traditional hero to more realistic proportions, which Camus called for when balanc- ing the powers and limits of human reason, man and what is not him.79 This excludes tragedy, too, for it shares with anthropocentrism the assumption of an essential human nature transcending concrete reality and condoning suffering.80 As a corollary, the new novel's polemic against anthropocentrism was also directed against the omniscient narrator and his really non- existent absolutist viewpoint that filters through the narrative. In Qu'est-ce que la littérature, Sartre, too, in the name of realism, rejected the author's intervention in narrative fiction, even the ineradicable im- plication that he exists. Such interventions, to him, only limit the pro- tagonist's freedom and the impression that he is really confronted with the contingency of existence, for an omniscient author betrays an under- lying order.81 Still, the total and subjective freedom that Sartre requires for his characters may result in a new anthropocentrism or "closed" humanism of the conceited, rationalistic variety.82 This is precisely Heidegger's argument in his Brief über den "Humanismus" (1947). 83 If, then, the "nouveau roman" shares with existentialism and with "Grace" a concern for present, concrete existence, while warning against excessive rationalism, it is also an honorable relative of Richard- son's "self-begetting" story, equally set on reflecting upon fiction (with its unrestrained creative power) and involving its recipients (inviting them to re-create the work, the world, their lives).84 From this perspec- tive the vaunted "presence" of the "nouveau roman" is that of the linguistic signifiers, severed from their signifieds in the external world</page><page sequence="27">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 67 and constituting "a world elsewhere." Thus, in "Grace" there remains the possibility that the narrator has invented the world around him rather than merely described it. In the end the many parallels between the "nouveau roman" and "Grace" allow us to see the gibe at it as a metafictional marker, Richard- son's paradoxical way of inviting his readership to view his art against the light of a kindred literary movement. Or perhaps it is even more correct to say that his debunking reference to the "nouveau roman" fails to hide his affinity with it, once this reference is deconstructed. The allusion to Master Abélard's "fate" (242) may well be another metafictional hint. The French Scholastic philosopher and theologian (1079-1142) was emasculated as punishment for his secret marriage with Héloise, with whose education he had been entrusted by her uncle, Fulbert, Canon of Notre Dame in Paris. As a consequence he became a monk. The reference gains relevance if we remember that Abélard, like the narrator, wrote an autobiography (History of My Misfortunes). He also adhered to the Socratic maxim, "Know Thyself," which he used as the title for one of his books on ethics, Scito Teipsum, and, as men- tioned earlier, part of the writer's initiation consists in learning to know oneself. Nor should we forget the controversy about the authorship of Héloise's letters, in view of the metafictional subversion of the narrator's tale. Lastly, as mentioned before, Abélard's appeal may stem from his reconciliation of reason and faith, the position that characterizes the narrator as well.85 The narrator's position seems, indeed, an intermediary one between theism and atheism. The "grace" of the title is neither some external redemptive power nor just man's assumption of his personal responsi- bility in keeping with his conscience. Something larger than the single individual is required though not necessarily transcendental in the tra- ditional sense: the community. The coincidence of the narrator's con- version with his initiation into the community and the absence of unassailable proof for God's existence, turn his faith into a metaphor for his personal commitment to that community. Actually, whether God exists or not is beside the point for Richardson (and for Sartre).86 Which brings us back to Camus. On the one hand, Camus is a confirmed atheist who rejects the leap of faith as an intellectual suicide.87 On the other hand, his atheism did not keep him from extensively using Christian elements in, for instance, La chute88 or from declaring the perfect compatibility of certain kinds of Christianity with the absurd, granted that, unlike Dostoyevski, they forsake the belief in a hereafter.89 What is more, Camus in L'homme révolté (like Sartre in L'existentialisme est un humanisme)90 defines the necessary rebellion against absurdity and the refusal to resort to meta-</page><page sequence="28">68 Johan Callens physical consolations as an automatic and meaningful affirmation of mankind, beginning with the self and extending to the others.91 What matters is to steer the middle course toward mankind, avoiding gods and idols alike.92 The narrator is never taken in by a mock saint such as Pablo Cordero, nor does he finally profess his belief in the God of the villagers. Rather, his faith expresses a newly gained confidence in humanity and its obsti- nate power to persevere against all odds, to embrace life and its fate, like Nietzsche did, and thus to overcome death.93 The faith the narrator professes in the end is humanistic rather than theocentric. He tells his story because, "while its essence is simple, it has brought me back from the dark complexities of Abaddon itself and into a world which, per- haps, I can now appreciate and, I use the word advisedly, love" (227- 28). The villagers' massive attendance of Mass on the Sunday following the drama is, therefore, an epiphany, not of divine but of human power, eclipsing in its intensity both Pablo's mock apparition and the narrator's recognitions. The importance of the initiation's social component (neglected by Marcus), when evaluating the narrator's conversion, cannot be over- rated. This is borne out by a comment Northrop Frye makes on Eliade's conception of religion. As Frye sees it, Eliade means by religion a universal human cultural phenomenon, as distinct from "a" re- ligion, which is a specific and exclusive institution, almost always claiming to result from a specific and exclusive revelation. "Religion" in this sense might be called a way of life that expresses a search for identification. As such, it does not need a personal God, for it may identify man simply with his own society through a symbol of soli- darity, as in totemism or Communism. The religious tendency seeks the existential, usually some functioning institution that responds to faith and commands loyalty.94 The narrator is indeed religious in the sense of feeling a need for iden- tification, which he satisfies through his conversion. His faith functions as a symbol of solidarity, signaling his initiation into the community. We realize that in calling the outcome of "Grace" "humanistic," we have recourse to a loaded term that has been used and abused. Some of the confusion goes back to Protagoras of Abdere, the chief figure among the sophists, who proclaimed that "man is the measure of all things." Bertrand Russell reads "each" man and interprets the state- ment as the foundation of a skeptical doctrine, for if each man is the measure, "when men differ, there is no objective truth in virtue of which one is right and the other is wrong."95 The classical humanists</page><page sequence="29">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 69 appropriated Protagoras's central idea, understood "man" to mean the species and gave it priority over the rest of creation. They mitigated the doctrine's original skepticism and sometimes displayed a presumptuous confidence in human reason. Ever since the 1960s "humanism" has been under attack from several viewpoints (philosophical, ideological, psychological, ecological, political, literary, theatrical, etc.). Ethnologists, too, had their say on the subject, and not just struc- turalists. As early as 1953, Eliade confessed that his comparative method (like that of Claude Lévi-Strauss), his decision to investigate modern Western civilization from the perspective of other cultures and religions, was inspired by a reaction against an excessive Eurocentrism (i.e., a misguided and restrictive humanism) and by the East's growing his- torical and economic power.96 To him, only the dialogue between Eastern and Western cultures can help humanity renew its identity and discover its truly universal values in order to found a "new humanism" on a world scale.97 In his famous lecture, Sartre also clarified his position with regard to that of the classical humanists, which he radically rejects. As he sees it, they wrongfully consider man in general (as idea and species) an end in itself and a superior, self -conferred value that does not require justi- fication by personal acts. Conversely, the existentialists' humanism signifies that there is only an inter subjective and man-made universe, constituted by one's "dépassement," the realization of one's project.98 Defined as such, Sartre's humanism nonetheless warrants the criticism of Heidegger as well as the ecologists. His assertion of man's superior dignity, compared to that of the natural world, confirms this.99 Yet Sartre cannot be accused of Eurocentrism, despite his rationalism, the European heritage of the Greeks. By granting the cultural and historical variety with which the universal human project is realized, he accepts the existence of different types of humanity and the possibility, if not the need, to understand them.100 In keeping, then, with the double focus of the initiation- the indi- vidual who is initiated and the community into which he is initiated- we must have another look at "Grace," from the perspective not of the narrator but of del Rio, whose ritual expulsion and death precedes and terminates the narrator's initiation. Since we shall do so with the help of René Girard' s scapegoat theory, we begin by summarizing it. At the risk of anticipating this theory, we here add, however, that Girard opposes both the classical humanists and the antiethnocentrists when these join forces in denying the reality of or condoning the collective violence at the heart of culture as a whole. The former do so by disin- terestedly analyzing literary texts; the latter, by prohibiting any censure of "primitive" peoples as condescending and presumptuous.101</page><page sequence="30">70 Johan Callens The Scapegoat Scenario Taking his cue from the structural anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, whom he otherwise criticizes a great deal, Girard defines culture as a system of differences founded by the collective immolation of a scape- goat that transforms reciprocal (i.e., evil, nondifferentiating, and con- tagious) violence threatening all community members alike (the vendetta, interminable retaliation) into a single act of unanimous, benevolent, and unilateral violence. At the same time, the violence is expelled from the community, externalized, and deified. The success of this double transfer (from the community to its substitute victim and from man to God) depends upon the community's unanimity and upon its ignorance ("méconnaissance") of the process. Religious rites and myths commem- orate this act of founding violence while obscuring its core, the double transfer. The ritual, controlled repetition (read "abreaction") of recipro- cal violence is meant to deter the community members from unleashing it blindly and to goad them into respect for religious rules. In periods of sacrificial crisis (i.e., whenever religion loosens its grip), reciprocal violence surfaces and, with it, the ominous image of total extinction. Our postmodern age with its threat of nuclear war and the encroach- ing entropy is a case in point to Girard. His soteriological intentions stand out clearly; he definitely wants to protect humanity from the apocalypse. But the solution he proposes in later works, notably Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde (1978), Le bouc émissaire (1982), and La Route antique des hommes pervers (1985), is not a rejuvenation of the rites of sacrificial violence that have upheld civilization, be it with increasing difficulty, up to the present.102 Instead, he wants to do away with violence altogether and replace it by Christ's pacifism as revealed in the Judeo-Christian texts. He considers this a morally acceptable solution to the present sacrificial crisis because it does not hypocritically deny man's responsibility for the violence; it is a safe solution, too, since man recently seems to have lost the faculty to externalize violence so that the homeopathic method of subduing violence through violence has become all too dangerous. What matters here, however, is not Girard' s hardly new solution to the present sacrificial crisis, not in the least because Richardson is not a man given to general solutions, as his tragicomic "philosophy" indi- cates. And for those trying to identify the pacifism of The Prodigal and Lorenzo with Girard's Christian solution, we add that this pacifism is subverted by a more belligerent Nietzschean strain noticeable in Aga- memnon and Van Miessen, which carries away, in my view, some of their author's approval. Here we need only be concerned with the "deep moment of crisis" (254) that the Spanish community in "Grace"</page><page sequence="31">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 71 goes through and averts by killing del Rio (i.e., by sacrificing him as a scapegoat). This allows us to complete the analysis begun with the help of Eliade's initiation scenario. Combining Girard and Eliade should cause no major problems. First, Girard' s general concept of "culture" as here defined hardly differs from Eliade's "Cosmos," since the two phenomena set up degree and difference in the undifferentiated Chaos. Both scholars also agree that primitive people associate the alternation of chaos and order- Eliade's death and rebirth, Girard' s sacrificial crises and periods of socioreligious stability- with the seasonal cycle, in contrast to the Cambridge ritualists who consider the seasonal cycle the origin of the alternation.103 Yet whereas for Eliade the sacred is the powerful and real, attribute of the supreme God who has always existed prior to man and apart from nature through which He only manifests himself, for Girard it is violence deified by man and then put on equal footing with natural powers (storms, forest fires, epidemics). The former views religious rites as a means of imitating the God, of participating in the sacred; the latter views them as means of keeping it at an appropriate distance, far enough to be safe from its contagion, near enough to enjoy its healing power. Girard feels justified in calling his interpretation of the sacred "une lecture impersonelle" because it forfeits anthropomorphic presences. Instead, the sacred manifests itself through the impersonal play of violence.104 Nevertheless, by locating, if not the source then at least a favorite field of the sacred in mankind, Girard holds on to an anthro- pocentrism that we also spotted in "Grace." Consequently, Girard has been accused of trying to "recuperate" the Bible in his later works by giving a "humanistic" reading of it.105 We must, however, distinguish between the sacrificial and the nonsacrificial elements of the Bible that oppose the false sacred or transcendence of reciprocal violence and the true divinity of love. Also, this false sacred is not "necessarily" human. In other words, humanizing violence, as Girard does, should not be equated with naturalizing violence, in the sense of considering it proper to man and inevitable. Otherwise the biblical revelation of sacrificial violence and the proposed remedy against it (altruism) would prove useless and Utopian,106 as much as Girard's scientific deconstruction of mimetic desire or Richardson's literary in- vestigations of violence. Violence, says the Frenchman, "has always been within man, without being for that matter instinctive."107 Its essence is its "désincarnation," its power to empty everything of its substance, which it needs to exercise on human subjects and which precludes its personification.108 All the same, regardless of his alleged scruples to hypostatize good and evil- scruples absent from the Bible and still insufficiently explicit in Des choses cachées- Girard affirms the</page><page sequence="32">72 Johan Callens existence of God and Satan so that his view is much too orthodox to be equated with Richardson's without qualifications. Second, in Girard's opinion, initiation rituals (all rituals, culture in general, really) are modeled after the founding sacrifice.109 And indeed, the symbolic death or return to the chaos preceding the cosmogony in Eliade's scenario can be explained, as Girard does, in terms of a momen- tary loss of differences that mark the transition from one identity or status to another. The mental tests or physical tortures that the novice submits to or the violence he has to commit (kill a man or an animal, etc.) stand for the reciprocal violence of the original crisis. And since reciprocal violence is contagious, the novice is isolated to prevent the contamination of the community. The ceremonies that imitate the crisis are followed by those that imitate the unanimity realized in opposition to the scapegoat, although Girard hastens to add that it is typical of initiations to focus on the crisis and to omit its resolution. That explains why these rites seem to constitute a separate category.110 "Grace" nevertheless exemplifies the whole scenario, despite some deviations or obscurities. One anomaly, for instance, is that del Rio's death seems a spontaneous repetition of the founding crime rather than a well-regulated and premeditated ritual reenactment, yet partakes of the ritualization of town life in general. The compatibility of the two scenarios may still not be apparent to the reader, the obvious reason being that the initiation scenario centers on the writer and the scapegoat scenario on del Rio. Yet the predicaments of the two protagonists cannot be separated from one another nor from that of the community, for that matter. Del Rio's death signifies the writer's rebirth and the community's regeneration. On the one hand, Girard as well as Eliade are positive about the renewal of the entire social order in the course of, respectively, sacrificial expulsions and individual initiations.111 That this renewal takes place in "Grace" hardly requires illustration. The Sunday following the double murder, the villagers attend church "in unison" (263), with even more piety and reverence than usual. The "saint" had promised "to give absolution to the whole town" (248), and the narrator's land- lady "was nice enough to include [him] in the miracle's expected bene- fits" (249). On the other hand, the narrator and del Rio are repeatedly associated. They can be seen as "reciprocal" characters, aspects of each other or fragments of a whole, del Rio being the writer's "infernal self" (264), the "beauty's" "beastly" alter ego.112 This explains why the narrator claims that the events he will describe have brought him "back from the dark complexities of Abaddon itself" (228) (i.e., some hellish place) and that they required him to refute his "infernal self" (264). If we disregard</page><page sequence="33">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 73 the story's metafictional subversion, the death and rebirth of Eliade's pattern coincide, then, with the narrator's fragmentation (witness the broken-mirror image) and his reintegration into a single personality and into the community. The identification of the narrator with del Rio is almost complete. The word "grace" (and its derivatives) is persistently, though ironically, used in connection with the hideous hunchback: he "graces" the writer with some theological instruction (235), has "the good grace" to invite the students to the writer's room (243), and shoulders his rifle "in one extremely graceful movement" (255). Gracefulness is surely a connotation of del Rio's profession: as a silversmith he must create beau- tiful and graceful jewels.113 Also, "grace" is what the writer yearns for (a "graceful parting" from this world, 229), displays (he "graciously" re- ceives the students, 244), and finally attains (the grace of the church, 237, and of the title). In addition, the narrator and del Rio are both artists (a writer and a silversmith) and outsiders in the village (a foreigner and a hunchback, voluntary exiles from the churchgoing community). We should, nonetheless, distinguish between the marginality of del Rio and that of the narrator. Erving Goff man' s notes on stigma and its management are a great help in doing so. In his native country, the narrator was a "disaffiliated," voluntarily declining, out of discontent and rebellion, the social place accorded him.114 He had shaken his fist at doors that excluded him (234), abandoned a promising career, and headed for Spain. There he initially played the "social deviant" who does not care about his social acceptance and ignores the prevailing norms because he feels superior to them.115 This feeling of superiority may cause the reader to consider the narrator before his conversion stigmatized in the religious sense of the word "stigmata" (namely, bodily signs of Holy Grace) in analogy with the wounds of the crucified Christ. Stigmata in the social and medical sense, such as del Rio's hunchback and atheism, are, on the contrary, experienced as disgraces. If this interpretation seems to turn the short story upside down- after all, it has been assumed that the narrator attains grace through his initiation/conversion- it permits us better to characterize the narrator's initial and final attitude. Despite the Christian overtones, his initial attitude would then quite paradoxically be "demonic," one of "ironic superiority," as opposed to his final more "saintly" one of "humble irony." As Hassan defines these kinds of irony (after Kenneth Burke), the latter implies a sense of kinship with the other in addition to a sense of isolation from him; in the former case "the isolation of the ego becomes total, and man stands alone in an infernal void."116 The narra- tor's final attitude therefore more closely approaches that of humble irony, which in turn corresponds to the contemporary tragicomic spirit. Says Hassan:</page><page sequence="34">74 Johan Callens If the energy of contemporary American fiction is the energy of opposition, its form is the form of irony. Irony implies distance, ambiguity, the interplay of views. It intercedes between poles of experience, unites the terrible and the ludicrous, and attempts to reconcile what remains, at bottom, irreconcilable: dream and fact. It is all the certainty we can allow ourselves where uncertainties prevail. Yet irony also commits itself to that which it criticizes.117 In contrast to the narrator, del Rio cares tremendously about his mar- ginality but cannot help it because it is due to a physical deformity. What is more, he plays up his stigma before the "normals" through his vitriolic atheism, a spiteful and grotesque reaction that Goff man dubbs "minis- trelization."118 As the writer's initiation progresses, he, too, begins to worry about his social acceptance. He becomes aware of the social stan- dards and of his failure to meet them. Hence, a feeling of social stigma- tization results, and the similarity with del Rio increases. The narrator's growing stigmatization explains his behavior after the first recognition scene. First, his impulse to wave at the priest exposes an urge to dis- sociate himself from del Rio (244). The more the narrator tries to "pass" as "normal," the more he fears the danger that lurks in disreputable relationships,119 a danger from which del Rio wants to protect him by keeping his visits secret (239). Second, the narrator is guilty of a "self- betraying stratification," typical of the stigmatized trying to "pass," when he establishes for the students his superiority over del Rio (247): with regard to another, more stigmatized person, the narrator takes up the discriminating attitudes of the "normals."120 If the writer's church- going ought to remove his stigma of areligiosity, the memory of it never- theless remains- the imprint of a stigma121- as well as his foreign nationality and his unusual profession (unusual, i.e., for this village). At the end of "Grace," the narrator, notwithstanding his claims of a total integration within the community, still occupies a singular position in it, though less singular than that of del Rio before him, which again confirms the story's ambivalence. The narrator himself reveals the indissoluble link between his fate and that of del Rio when he announces the end of their weekly meetings: "something happened which caused an abrupt change in both our lives. I wish I could say that it was my death, but, au contraire, it was some- thing which enmeshed me deeper into life" (239, first emphasis added). Since the subject of the conversation has been, up to now, the relation- ship between the two men, mention of the writer's rebirth implies del Rio's death (especially when one stresses the possessive pronoun "my" in the above quotation). The complementarity, even interchangeability, of the two protagonists is literally enacted during the final scene in the</page><page sequence="35">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 75 mountains. While the narrator-initiate stands aloof, del Rio, the outsider, moves from "the outer fringe of worshippers" to the exact "center of the still kneeling townspeople" (254-55). No sooner has the fatal shot rung out, but the human configuration changes into a "man-made" circle around the hunchback (257) who is thus, for a brief moment, integrated before being ostracized. He is then reincarnated, so to speak, in the narrator, the new local odd-bird. Richardson carefully prepares for del Rio' s sacrificial expulsion by introducing replicas of the original scapegoat mechanism: purifications and exorcisms. Both often accompany primitive New Year rituals, and as we have shown, "Grace" presupposes a New Year symbolism.122 Purification and exorcism are even explicitly referred to. Trying to ac- count for del Rio' s exclusion from the Sunday services, the writer supposes that "he might have some unsociable malady" (234), and at the thought of a personal encounter with del Rio, he dreads "that the disease which ostracized him from the community would also afflict me" (235). Del Rio is thus identified with the "katharma," the evil or impure object purged from the body during purification rituals and a metaphorical displacement of the "pharmakos" or scapegoat.123 Because the removal of the "katharma" restores the (social) body's health, Richardson at one time compares del Rio to "a rural doctor comforting a sick and frightened farmer" (235). Evil violence is indeed transformed into a benevolent power once its expulsion has reestablished order and peace. In a way, the narrator, who came to Spain seeking to regain his (spiritual) health (229), is cured by vaccination. He is inoculated with the disease del Rio represents and is thus made immune against it. In exorcisms the devil dons the scapegoat costume.124 We have already seen how del Rio is presented as a devilish figure. Hence, he is also susceptible to exorcisms: "Finally the church bells announced the ser- vice had ended, and, like some evil spirit who has just seen the cross held in front of him, this ridiculous little Satan hobbled out of my room" (237). While leading the procession into the mountains, the priest carries a large wooden cross high in front of him as if to exorcize any evil spirits that might cross his path (250). Finally, during his vigil, the narrator suffers from visions of del Rio's and Pablo's soiled faces until "the ringing of the Sunday morning call to worship sent these phantoms scurrying for cover" (262). In two of the three references to exorcism, the demons can be del Rio and one or both of the Cordero brothers. Still, it is del Rio who ends up as a scapegoat, despite the misgivings one may possibly have about his eligibility for the role. His stigma, his ambivalent identity, and his lapi- dation by the whole community speak in favor of him, but his personal guilt and a chronological quirk, as it were, seem to speak against him.</page><page sequence="36">76 Johan Callens As a matter of fact, the villagers kill del Rio while still deluded about the saint's authenticity. Their panic breaks loose only after they have recognized the bloodied and disfigured face as Pablo Cordero's. Del Rio's death, then, seems not to resolve but to cause a collective crisis, although, in a way, it constitutes an apt punishment for his offense. Del Rio's individual guilt apparently forces us to reject him as a scape- goat for collective violence. Individual guilt does not enter the picture, says Girard. It is the disturbing product of theology and of the psy- chologism prevailing in Western societies, and it obscures the essence of reciprocal violence.125 The latter's contagious, "mimetic" quality makes everyone guilty, the scapegoat who shall atone for this violence neither more nor less than the rest. Despite appearances, "Grace" fulfills the condition of unanimous guilt: at the outset of the drama, the peasants can be charged with the blasphemy of adoring a fake saint, del Rio and the two students with that of mocking the local religion. In killing Pablo, del Rio acts a first time as substitute of the community, who would, in all likelihood, have done the same, had it seen through the students' deception. In dying for his impulsive deed, he acts a second time as substitute, expiating the hidden collective guilt. Del Rio's direful end inculpates the entire village a second time, for everyone participates in the miraculous tragedy (262), including the priest and the narrator who fail to prevent it. The latter two thereby amply illustrate Sartre's dictum that not to choose is a choice all the same.126 Del Rio's apparently personal guilt and the chronological twist just mentioned help "Grace" to meet another condition for the success of the scapegoat mechanism, namely, the participants' relative ignorance about its functioning. These surface deviations from the deep structure of the event can be considered as a measure of the general misjudgment or "méconnaissance." In this respect, the reader should remember how the narrator belittles the importance of his story by comparing it to myths and tales (227), an appropriate comparison, since Girard is con- vinced that myths conceal the founding violence through differentiation and symbolization, as opposed to tragedies that deconstruct differences and confront the spectator brutally with reciprocal violence.127 Girard's definition of "myth" easily covers its traditional and popular meanings, of a fiction or fable and of a narrative relating how something came into being (i.e., how Eliade interprets the term), a symbolic structure hiding and revealing the truth at the same time.128 The truth of the matter is that, all along, del Rio was meant to become a scapegoat: his hunchback, a natural stigma, and his ambiguous status have predestined him for the role. As to del Rio's hunchback, Goffman touches indirectly upon the vulnerability of the stigmatized to collective</page><page sequence="37">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 77 violence searching for an outlet. He explains how the "normals" "tend to impute [to the stigmatized] a wide range of imperfections on the basis of the original one, and at the same time to impute [to him or her] some desirable but undesired [sic] attributes, often of a supernatural cast, such as 'sixth sense/ or 'understanding.' " Both reactions illustrate how the "normals" construct a "stigma-theory" about the stigmatized, "an ideology to explain his inferiority," "a gestalt of disability" to rationalize discriminatory behavior.129 In retrospect, accounting for their collective murder, the villagers may thus blame del Rio for other misfortunes, suspecting that he had a hand in them, that all the time he had been in the know. In certain American Indian tribes, hunchbacks are endowed with predictive powers. Similarly, the unlucky Prometheus, patron of potters and smiths, hence of del Rio, is "the god who foresees."130 This also explains why del Rio' s immolation signifies a general regeneration and not just the righting of a single wrong. With respect to del Rio' s ambivalence, we have to make the move from the spontaneous primal murder to its controlled ritual enactment, a distinction made by Girard but obfuscated by Richardson.131 The ritualization consists in fixing the manner in which the violence is to be committed or in adding symbolic details; it imposes regulations of a different kind, too. Whereas originally the choice of a scapegoat had been totally arbitrary- every community member being equally guilty of reciprocal violence- it is now limited to a poorly integrated individual, partly an insider able to represent the community as a scapegoat, partly an outsider to facilitate the evacuation of internal violence. The death of a fully integrated individual would appear as one more instance of re- ciprocal violence and would call for revenge. For moral reasons, the human victim is also frequently replaced by an animal, whence the word "scapegoat" is derived.132 Despite the spontaneity of del Rio's death, "Grace" also testifies to its ritualistic character, which may be an index to its "literary" status.133 It is indirectly anticipated in the narrator's mention of his "private ritual of dying" (229), but we may derive it from the highly ritualized town life in general as well. The weekdays all look alike, with the morning market, the priest's visits to his sick parishioners, and the evening entertainment. Sunday Mass is a ritual that exceeds its usual limits of time (more or less an hour) and space (the church) through the solemn round-up and the respects paid to the priest at any time. The ritualiza- tion of everyday life, in all likelihood, leads the narrator to speak of the "pristine rhythm of life" (263) that is disrupted temporarily by Pablo and Juan Cordero but restored in an act of collective violence. As an indispensable preliminary to it, the villagers form around their victim a neat circle, a symbol of their unanimity and, as we have seen, of del</page><page sequence="38">78 Johan Callens Rio's brief integration before his expulsion. The circle is also reminiscent of Eliade's "sacred space" in which ritualized gestures are performed. Accordingly, the villagers stone del Rio to death, whereas del Rio shot Pablo with a gun. Thus Richardson sets up an opposition, illustrating the transfer from profane and evil violence (del Rio's) to sacred and benevo- lent violence (the community's). The lapidation successfully puts a stop to reciprocal violence by avoiding bloodshed, by preventing the com- munity's defilement through contact with the impure victim, and by allowing that entire community's participation.134 The ambivalence of sacrificial violence is commensurate with and its successful about-face dependent upon that of its object, del Rio, whether the cause or the result of his victimization. Twice he is likened to an animal: after his humiliation by Pablo, del Rio behaves like a "whipped and repentant animal" (247) and following the mock saint's order of expulsion, he starts "screaming in the voice of a maimed and desperate animal" (255). Del Rio's duplicity is established in other ways, too. He is an insider of the village, well-informed about its latest gossip (239), and an outsider, not attending church; he is devilish and divine, asso- ciated with Satan and Hephaistos. Like the God of antiquity, del Rio is a horrid character and an excellent craftsman of beautiful objects. The shift from blacksmith to silversmith, highlighting del Rio's paradoxical "gracefulness," enriches the story's texture with a cross-reference to the narrator who awaits "grace," but through its subtlety in no way obscures the symbolism of the original profession.135 Girard believes that smiths occupy a singular position in traditional cultures. They are a positive resource as the producers of tools to facilitate work and of weapons with which to defend the village against enemies. But since these weapons can aggravate internal disputes, smiths are also looked upon as evil presences. This ambivalence explains, according to Girard, why smiths are favorite scapegoats for misfortunes of any kind.136 Once again the irreverent Prometheus comes to mind. Del Rio's immolation even increases his initial ambivalence. Having been sacrifices he is now himself sacrificed; the evil violence that he inflicted upon others is transformed into benevolent violence inflicted upon him. Ultimately he represents the "monstrous doubles" emerging at the paroxysm of reciprocal violence and signaling the erasure of dif- ferences that results from their ever-accelerating oscillation (i.e., the dangerous "play of violence" that incriminates everyone). Once sacri- ficed, this undifferentiated monstrosity that lurks within mankind is relegated to the sacred (i.e., whatever is external to man and escapes his conscious control: natural powers, etc.). Del Rio's performance has given the villagers and the writer, after all, a brief epiphany of which the mock saint's apparition was the prologue.137 The writer's indirect</page><page sequence="39">Richardson's "In the Final Year of Grace" 79 participation in this partly spontaneous, partly ritualized killing signifies his initiation into the violence, which to Girard, is at the heart of the sacred. Conclusion In retrospect, this analysis of "Grace," based on Eliade and Girard' s views, not only has proved the story's intricacy and Richardson's crafts- manship but also has enabled us to grasp the deeper ambiguities of its outcome, for the close relationship of the two protagonists inevitably results in the mutual qualification of their fate. At first sight, "Grace" chronicles two successful processes: an initiation that culminates into the sacrifice of a scapegoat that symbolizes death and disorder. Together with the narrator's existentialist refutation of the absurd and the restora- tion of the social order, these constitute the story's comic resolution as defined by Northrop Frye.138 Yet Frye adds that: The tendency of comedy is to include as many people as possible in its final society: the blocking characters are more often reconciled or converted than simply repudiated. Comedy often includes a scapegoat ritual of expulsion which gets rid of some irreconcilable character, but exposure and disgrace make for pathos, or even tragedy.139 Del Rio's and Pablo's deaths hover as a shadow over the comic resolu- tion, making for a tragicomic effect, the more so, since del Rio represents that part of the narrator that had to be relinquished in order to allow his integration into the community. Conversely, del Rio appears less of a victim sacrificed for his rebelliousness and nonconformism when we consider that he is reincarnated in the writer. The success of the writer's initiation is further diminished by our lingering feeling that a small Spanish village is not the world at large and that life in it may still be sheltered and alienated. The narrator has, after all, fled the final con- frontation with existence in his native country; he has met life only half way. And he confesses that, only seven years after his initiation, he felt "qualified to recount this tale to a world which [he] might very well have forgotten" (264). The possibility that the narrated events are no more than a "tale" further hypothecates the narrator's social integration. By the same token, he is counting on the renewal of his readership and a different kind of communion. Finally, if our qualification of the narra- tor's faith as a humanistic love prevents us from considering it here as a renunciation of his atheism and another form of recoil,140 love, to Hassan, also often equals a "withdrawal into communion," a diffusion</page><page sequence="40">80 Johan Callens of the self.141 From this perspective, the narrator's atheism, foreign nationality, and unusual profession must be interpreted as positive remnants of his individuality.

Primitive man longs to live as close to the center as possible, hence his attempt to reconstruct it as often as possible (Le sacré, 39-40). In " Grace/' the church stands metaphorically and literally at the center of the village; it is significant, therefore, that the narrator moves into a room with a view of that church. The church spire and the moun- tain, like sacred ladders, trees, or pillars, all symbolize the "Axis Mundi" that joins heaven, earth, and hell (Le sacré, 34-35). 21.

The association with Hephaistos augments del Rio 's tragicomic dimension, for the Greek god used to be the laughing stock of the other gods because of his handicap and marital misfortunes.

As a result of the essay's accessibility, Sartre's existentialism is probably more widely known (and applied in literature) in this loose form than in the more rigorous one of L'être et le néant, though Richardson, a philosophy graduate, is likely to be familiar with both writings. 46.

Hence, Eliade is disingenuous when he claims in Mythes, rêves et mystères that the existentialists take comfort in their pessimism (70). Of course, Nietzsche's, Camus 's, and Heidegger's transcendence of anxiety occurs within this world, whereas to archaic and religious man, it ultimately takes place in a hereafter, to which the dead are said to gain access and which, insofar as it is the realm of the sacred, is the very opposite of Nothingness, namely, the fullness of Being (65-66). Eliade may have disagreed with this distinction because, to him, the symbolic death of initiations prefigures real death and allows primitive man already to participate, on this earth, in the sacred and its immortality (279). 60.

In Initiation, 16-17, and Le sacré, 47, 87-88, Eliade only testifies indirectly to the frequent presence of human or animal sacrifices in initiation rituals; these symbolize a return to the aboriginal Chaos and a reenactment of the cosmogony that often involved the ritual sacrifice of some god or hero. Yet in Forgerons et alchimistes, 54-59, he shows that rituals connected with smiths often involved the literal or symbolic mutilation, even immolation, of the smith himself (or his substitute) who, as we have seen, is often ascribed the role of initiation master. Reasons for these sacrifices can be the smith's assumed offense to the gods (e.g., through his dirty, "primitive" preoccupation) or, as also mentioned before, his identification as some demon because of his magical (re)creative power. 110.

Actually, Girard accepts the possibility of an intermediary stage between the spontaneous crime and its ritual reenactment, as is illustrated in the execu- tion of St. Stephen at the end of his trial by the Sanhédrin (Acts of the Apostles</page><page sequence="46">86 Johan Callens 7:51-58); what is more, he uses it to support his hypothesis that religious, legal, and social institutions are founded on sacrificial violence (Des choses cachées, 256). 132. Girard, La violence, 22-26, 63-64, 401-07. 133. Given the exceptional codification of everyday behavior and the added mythic-symbolic dimension, " Grace' ' displays ritual in two of the three guises that it may, according to Mordecai Marcus, assume in fiction, the third one, here absent, being the realistic "portrayal of the formalized behaviour of primitives or folks people7 ' (Marcus, 221-22). 134. Girard, Des choses cachees, 254-55. For Girard, that the lapidation takes place outside the village further reduces the risk of defilement for the partici- pants. If this interpretation seems to contradict our (and Eliade's) earlier one, according to which the place of the pseudotheophany is the symbolic center of the world, we must add that the contradiction exists in Girard, too, when he reminds the reader that sacrificial stones, supposedly at the heart of ancient cities and surreptitiously commemorating an original crime, often constitute their founding place (245). 135. Achilles shield, one of Hephaistos creations described by Homer, por- trays in miniature- as a story within the story- life in a Greek polis, in times of peace and war (The Iliad, trans. Robert Fitzgerald [Garden City, N.Y.: Double- day, 1975], 447-54). Like Homer's epic on a much larger scale, it illustrates how in those days art, whether that of a minstrel or smith, encompassed all of civili- zation and nature. The association with Hephaistos adds therefore to the "cos- mological" valence of del Rio's death, enabling a renewal of the whole com- munity. íób. tirara, La violence, àov-yi. 137.
