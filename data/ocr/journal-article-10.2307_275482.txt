<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CHRONOLOGICAL OUTLINE FOR THE NORTHWEST FLORIDA COAST1 GORDON R. WILLEY and R. B. WOODBURY T HE northwestern part of Florida is a strip of land about 225 miles long, extending from Pensacola Bay to Apalachee Bay, in which are recognized two physiographic regions, "Flatwoods and Hammock Lands," along the coast, and "Southern Pine Hills," inland.2 The coastal region, in which are located most of the sites to be considered, is quite flat and of uniformly low elevation, and includes several con- trasting types of landscape. The greater part of the land is occupied by the flatwoods or open groves of longleaf and other pines interspersed with grassy meadows and the hammock lands, which support a denser vegetation characterized by palmetto and hardwoods. Along the major rivers are swamps through which wind creeks and bayous. In the west is a small but distinctive area, formed by a narrow strip of sand dunes, nearly barren of vegetation, which lies along the coast between the beach and the flatwoods. The soil of nearly all of northern Florida is a grey sand of Pleistocene age, with local clay beds and occasional peat and muck deposits. The north Florida portion of the Gulf Coast is indented by several large bays (Pensacola, Choctawhatchee, St. Andrews, Apalachicola, and Apalachee) into which flow most of the rivers of the area. More than half of the sites found are situated on these bays; half of the re- mainder are on sounds which are separated from the Gulf by bars and spits of sand formed by coastwise currents. 1 This preliminary report covers a part of the work accomplished during the summer of 1940 by a Columbia University-National Park Service archaeological survey into Florida. The authors wish to express their gratitude to their instructors and advisors, Drs. W. D. Strong and Ralph Linton, of Columbia University, who made the survey possible. In addition, we should like to extend our thanks to the various officers of the Na- tional Park Service who gave valuable assistance at all times, especially Dr. A. R. Kelly, of Washington, D. C., Mr. C. H. Fairbanks, of Macon, Georgia, and Mr. L. G. Hill, of Foley, Alabama. In particular, we would like to point out the efficient aid rendered us at the Park Service Museum at Ocmulgee National Monument, Macon, Georgia. It is the policy of this institution to offer its facilities of processing and cataloguing to all recognized organizations carrying out archaeological research in the Southeast. WPA project 5551 (Georgia) also assisted in this work. For permission to conduct investigations on several private properties, and for other courtesies, we are indebted to all of those landowners in west Florida who extended us this permission, and to numerous others both in Florida and Georgia. 2 Fenneman, 1938; Cooke and Mossum, 1939; Harper, 1914; Matson and Sanford, 1913.

Although the climate is favor- able to heavy vegetation, as shown by the hammock lands and swamps, the soil and drainage near the coast are poor for intensive agriculture. Previous to white settlement this region had abundant game, such as deer, turkey, bear, raccoon, cougar, quail, and duck, and was especially rich in fish and shellfish. Oysters and shrimps are one of the principal FIG. 24.-Map of area surveyed; dots indicate sites at which surface collections were made, triangles, excavated sites. economic resources of the coast at present, and the numerous oyster and clam shell middens attest to the importance of sea food in the past. These middens also contain abundant fish and animal bones. Typically, a shell midden site is composed of a few feet of refuse that accumulated gradually during the occupation of the site, which is located on a small natural elevation along a bay or sound. Nearby, the distance varying from 100 meters to over a quarter of a mile, is a small, conical, sand burial mound. The assumption is made that the midden represents a village from which the burials in the mound were made, and that the association is not fortuitous. This assumption is well supported by the evidence of the pottery from the two. In nearly every instance, the burial mound is less accessible by water and to foot travel 233</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY than the midden area, and is usually situated in a dense hammock or swamp. Eighty-seven sites were listed during the season's survey (Fig. 24). At six of these, stratigraphic testing was undertaken. The total may be subdivided and classified as follows:3 55 shell middens 8 with conical sand mounds (6 of these listed by Moore) 31 without other features 1 with pyramidal mound (listed by Moore) 15 with conical sand mounds reported but not found by authors (14 of these were listed by Moore). In many instances the surrounding hammock land was so dense as to make a search useless in the limited time available. 21 occupation areas (very thin scattered midden) 1 with conical sand mound 4 with pyramidal mounds 3 with Spanish Mission ruins 13 without other features 9 conical sand mounds (exclusive of those listed above) 5 with middens reported by Moore but not found by authors 4 without other features (1 listed by Moore) 1 pyramidal mound 1 mound complex The most extensive published data available on the archaeology of northwest Florida are the reports of Clarence B. Moore.4 His excava- tions were confined almost entirely to the conical sand burial mounds, and these findings were presented without chronological implications. The more recent work of Fewkes5 and Stirling6 in the Tampa Bay district, has begun the chronological distinctions of ware types and the definition of time horizons for west Florida. Stirling has also ventured some general opinions on the position of Florida in the southeastern culture area. More distant, but important, are the chronological "yardsticks" which have been established in central and coastal Georgia and southern Louisiana (Fig. 25). By combining the descriptive and distributional data on pottery styles compiled by Moore, Holmes, and Fewkes, with sequential evi- dence of pottery types from these other areas, it is possible to draw inferences as regards chronology in northwest Florida. This coastal strip, Pensacola Bay and the main body of the Florida peninsula is 3 Moore, 1901-1918, in the first extensive survey of this coast, recorded ninety-five sites for the same area. Twenty-eight of these were re-identified by the authors among the eighty-seven mentioned above. In nearly every instance the burial mounds listed by Moore were completely or partially excavated by him. Many have been more recently excavated by unknown investigators. 4 Moore, 1901-1918. 6 Fewkes, 1924. 6 Stirling, 1936. 234 [3, 1942</page><page sequence="4">WILLEY AND WOODBURY] NORTHWEST FLORIDA COAST geographically indicated as a key area in the study of the relationships between the western and eastern Gulf coastal plain, and the relation- ships of both of these to peninsular Florida.

It is probable that the wide spread checked stamped pottery was developed to the east.8 The fine incised and punc- tate "Apalachicola" or "Weeden Island" ware appears to stem out of the lower Mississippi Valley.9 Whereas the "Mississippian-like" pottery around Pensacola Bay has its immediate affiliations in south and central Alabama. 7 Holmes, 1894, p. 114 ff. s Nelson, 1918. 9 Stirling, 1936, p. 353. 235</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Thus, any stratigraphic data from northwest Florida would not only solve local problems but would serve to check and synchronize the chronologies in neighboring areas. Attention, then, was concentrated on refuse middens from village sites, and no attempt was made to ex- plore either the sand burial mounds surviving Moore's work or the large flat-topped pyramidal mounds. No village site was extensively excavated, and no information was obtained on house form, groupings, or burial practices. Sherds comprised by far the largest part of the artifacts recovered. As pottery types serve as keys to the chronologies of adjacent regions, surface collections of sherds were analyzed in terms of compar- able data from Georgia, Tampa Bay, and Louisiana. This preliminary classification of pottery was used in deciding what surveyed sites should be excavated. Geographical spacing of sites along the coast, depth and nature of midden, and probable richness of site were factors in deter- mining the choice. The excavation technique employed was simple: pits or test blocks one and one-half to three meters square were excavated by 10 cm. levels, digging well into sterile soil. All cultural material, and samples of shell, animal bones, and soil were saved by level. A number of these pits were distributed over the midden at a site in order to sample every undisturbed portion. The sites excavated, listing from east to west, are Lake Jackson, Mound Field, Carrabelle, Sowell, Ft. Walton, and Gulf Breeze (see map, Fig. 24.). The time chart (Fig. 26.) is presented as a summary of the chrono- logical results from the six excavated sites, and may be referred to in connection with the discussion of archaeological materials. The correlation of various sites has been made on the basis of pottery types occurring in the different levels, and, therefore, is a relative, not an absolute, chronology. Any pottery type is based on a number of sty- listic features found in combination, but changes occur through time, and transitions are often so gradual as to prevent sharp distinctions. However, the periods into which the pottery types have been grouped are each based on one or more "key" or "marker" types, which have been found to be sufficiently restricted in range and distinctive in ap- pearance to allow their occurrence to be quite precisely determined. It is also hoped that the "periods" will prove to represent distinct cultures when the bare skeleton of a ceramic chronology has been given flesh and body in the form of a full and "functional" culture description. There is reason to believe that the Deptford and Swift Creek periods, as total cultures, were different from each other socially and/or 236 [3, 1942</page><page sequence="6">rI :9 i") na a C3 X -VI ?7I f" ?c f: Z t7 ' B rri rn F-h- 3t I - V- : P Z-t oq Z: SHELL TEMPERE lOTOHZD RIMS An D.

The latter are, in turn, distinguished from Ft. Walton, a period showing Mississippian traits which are lacking in Weeden Island. Thus, although it is not the purpose of this paper to describe total cultural configurations, it should be remembered that these periods refer to "cultures" in the full sense, as well as pottery types. Further research should supply the additional information for fuller definition of these periods. It is the authors' belief that Deptford and Swift Creek periods are time intervals during which there existed cul- tures (to which the same names can be applied) which are "South- eastern Woodland" in the sense that that term can be used to denote fundamental relationships to the Woodland Pattern as it is now con- ceived. Weeden Island I and II show affinities to "basic Hopewellian." Santa Rosa, in the west, on the basis of pottery data alone, would appear to be a Hopewellian (Marksville) and Swift Creek mixture. Ft. Walton, while definitely related to the older cultures of north- western Florida, has decided Middle Mississippian connections. The broad archaeological problem is two-fold: first, describing a cultural continuum, albeit interrupted with cross-influences from time to time, within an area in terms of some suitable and selected criteria; and second, isolating cultures as complete entities which in the past were functioning societies. At this time the authors have data for only a partial solution of the first part of the problem. In presenting these recently obtained distribution and stratigraphic data it is also our purpose to interpret further the previous descriptive archaeology of the area. POTTERY TYPES The pottery types used in this study are comparable in descriptive range to those formulated by several archaeologists in the southeastern United States.10 Each type represents a range of combination possi- bilities in surface decoration, materials and techniques of manufacture, and form." As such they are assemblages of characteristic features of a group of pottery vessels. No one vessel (or sherd) will show all the characteristic features, but all vessels included in a type will possess a reasonable number of those specified as definitive of the type. Owing to limitations of space the following are but very synoptic descriptions of the more important types of each period. 10 See Newsletters of the Southeastern Archaeological Conference, 1939-1940. 11 Rouse, 1939, pp. 10-12. Rouse has discussed this concept of the type thoroughly. The type is, to follow Rouse, "an abstract kind of artifact which symbolizes the group." However, the types used in this study are apparently more restricted in range of "char- acteristic attributes" or "modes" than those of Rouse's West Indian studies. 238 [3, 1942</page><page sequence="8">WILLEY AND WOODBURY] NORTHWEST FLORIDA COAST D FIG. 27.-Whole vessels of various types (after Moore).

XI, Fig. 1, A and B) is the marker type for this period. Northwest Florida pottery of this type varies but little from the original description from the Georgia Coast.12 Like most of the types described in this paper, with the exception of fibre or shell tempered pottery, it is a coiled, sand tempered ware of a buff color. Decoration covers most of the vessel exterior and is a linear check stamp impression. The horizontal lands of the stamping are heavier and wider than the small vertical lands. This linear effect dis- tinguishes the type decoration from other check stamped types. Rims are straight to slightly flaring. Lips are rounded. Conoidal bases are suggested by a few large fragments. Deptford Bold Check Stamped (PI. XI, Fig. 1, C and D) has also been described from the Georgia Coast.'3 There, and in northwest Florida, it is found associated with the linear check stamping. The two types are similar in general ware qualities. The individual checks of the bold stamped type are large (5 to 7 mm. square) and deep with heavy lands. The decoration covers the vessel exterior. Deptford Simple Stamped (P1. XI, Fig. 1, G and H) is the third type in the complex as defined from the Georgia Coast.14 It conforms in ware and shape standards to the other two types. The decoration is simple linear groove stamping, apparently applied to vessel exteriors with a grooved or thong-wrapped paddle. In northwest Florida, the linear check stamped appears to be the somewhat earlier type and the Deptford Bold Check Stamped slightly later. Deptford Simple Stamped occurs only sporadically, but would seem to be more recent than other Deptford types. All three types are more common in the St. Marks and Apalachee Bay region than to the west. The linear check stamped was not found by us west of the Apalachicola River. Tetrapodal pot supports (P1. XI, Fig. 1, F) may be discussed in connection with the Deptford period although they also occur on the later type, Swift Creek Complicated Stamped, and plain sand tempered ware. The supports are teat-like in form. Spacing depends upon vessel shape. On rounded bottoms they are as much as 6 cms. apart. When they occur on more markedly conoidal bases, a little rectangular plat- 12 Caldwell and Waring, 1939, No. 5, type description Deptford Linear Check Stamped. 13 Caldwell and Waring, 1939, No. 6, type description Deptford Bold Check Stamped; Holmes, 1903, PI.

Similar supports are recorded for Deptford Simple Stamped and other early types16 in Geor- gia. They are a common trait of the Tchefuncte period of southern Louisiana.'6 In northwest Florida, tetrapods were found by us all the way from Pensacola to Apalachee Bay. As Deptford is stratigraphically the earliest horizon yet discovered in the northwest coast region, it is of interest to mention that a few sherds tempered with fibre (P1. XI, Fig. 1, E) were found in the lower levels of the Carrabelle site along with Deptford check stamped types. Wherever it is found stratigraphically in the southeastern United States, fibre tempered pottery is early.'7 Pottery Types of the Santa Rosa-Swift Creek Period Swift Creek Complicated Stamped was first distinguished as an early variety of complicated stamped pottery in central Georgia.18 It has been well described and illustrated in the more recent, as well as the older,19 literature. There are some differences in the northwest Florida coast variant of this type, but similarities with central Georgia are very strong. In Florida, Swift Creek Complicated Stamped, stratigraphically isolated in its earlier stages (P1. XI, Fig. 2, A; Fig. 27, A), more closely resembles the Georgia material than it does in its later stages. A late Swift Creek Complicated Stamped (P1. XI, Fig. 2, E; Fig. 27, B) shows influence of the Weeden Island style. Intricacy and neatness of execu- tion of the complicated stamped designs falls off in the late Florida stage of the type. There is a change in vessel shape from the conoidal or round based pot form to flattened globular bowls or globular jars with necks or collars, and stamped decoration is confined to a zone around the upper part of the vessel. This last is a trait in the Weeden Island tradition as opposed to the older Woodland idea of covering the vessel exterior with stamping. The heavy folded rim replaces the plain or notched rim. Although a detailed analysis of Swift Creek design elements and forms has not yet been published, Kelly has pointed out a developmental sequence at the Swift Creek site which checks in some 15 Jennings and Fairbanks, 1939, type description Swift Creek Complicated Stamped. 16 Ford, 1939, personal communication. 17 Griffin, 1939, discusses this point pp. 158-160; Kelly, 1938, pp. 30, 36, 60, and PI. 10; Holmes, 1894, discussion of "Midden Ware"; and Haag, 1939, type description Wheeler Plain. 18 Kelly, 1938, pp. 25 ff. and 32 ff.; Willey, 1939. pp. 145-146; Jennings and Fair- banks, 1939, type description Swift Creek Complicated Stamped. 19 Holmes, 1903, pp. 122-123; Moore, 1902, Figs. 59, 108, 174, 205, and 272 (early type), and Figs. 64, 168, 223, and 224 (late type). 241</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY particulars with the sequences obtained at Carrabelle and Mound Field.20 Marksville Stamped (PI. XI, Fig. 2, G; Fig. 27, F) and Marksville Incised (PI. XI, Fig. 2, F) have been described by Setzler,21 Ford,22 and Ford and Willey23 from burial mound sites in Louisiana. Greenman24 has called attention to their sporadic occurrence in west Florida. The re- lationship between the Marksville complex of Louisiana and the Hopewellian of the north has also been pointed out by the above writers. These types occur with relative abundance along with Swift Creek Complicated Stamped in midden sites between Choctawhatchee and Pensacola Bays. The Santa Rosa variants of the Marksville types are a little sandier in texture than the Louisiana ware. In decoration, the plain rather than the dentate rocker or roulette stamp is the rule. Folded rims or plain rims are noted, but the characteristic "cambered" rim of Louisiana and the north does not appear. The "bird" design, common both in Louisiana and in the north, is very rare in Florida. Santa Rosa Stamped26 (PI. XI, Fig. 2, H) is similar in ware qualities to the other two Florida variants of the Marksville. Vessel form is doubtful, but the presence of the notched rim or lip and tetrapodal supports is noted. Decoration consists of rows of unnotched rocker stamping widely spaced over vessel exterior. Rows may run horizon- tally or vertically on the vessel. The rocker stamping is not zoned with the deep, round-bottomed incising characteristic of Marksville Stamped. Pottery Types of the Weeden Island Periods Weeden Island Incised26 (P1. XII, Fig. 1, A and B; Fig. 27, C and E) is the marker type of the culture and both the periods into which it is divided in this paper. The ware characteristics of all Weeden Island types are similar to those of the Swift Creek period. Surface finish shows more tendency toward polish, but tempering and firing are about the same. The use of an interior red film is sometimes noted in plain or 20 Kelly, 1938, pp. 28 ff. and PI. 11. 21 Setzler, 1933. n Ford, 1936, pp. 219-240. 23 Ford and Willey, 1940, pp. 65-78. 24 Greenman, 1938.

Decoration of Weeden Island Incised is extremely varied and skillfully conceived and executed. The basic idea of design is negative with positive areas left plain and slightly raised while backgrounds are often slightly depressed and filled with punctations, incised hachure, or red paint. Both incised lines and dotted punctate lines are used in outlining the design. Large triangular and hollow reed punctations are often placed in or on the ends of incised or dotted lines. There are a great number of vessel forms. The most common is the flattened globular bowl with constricted orifice. The folded rim predominates. Triangular lateral projections on the rims of shallow bowls (4 projections to a bowl) are a characteristic appendage. Bird's head effigies in semi-round relief are often affixed to the globular bowls or jars just below the rim. Weeden Island Incised is the classic burial mound pottery of west and northwest Florida. It is found in diminishing quantities to the north and east. To the west it is closely related to the Troyville-Coles Creek period type, French Fork Incised. Weeden Island Plain27 makes up at least 80% of the sherd count of the Weeden Island pottery complex at any village site. It is identical in ware characteristics with Weeden Island Incised, and similar to Swift Creek Complicated Stamped in texture and paste consistency. This latter similarity makes it difficult to distinguish small body and bottom sherds of the two complexes. In this study only rim sherds were classified as Weeden Island Plain, and all plain sherds with fine sand and grit temper were counted separately in a residual category. Weeden Island Plain rim profiles are most commonly incurving, except in the cases of open bowls or collared forms. Rims are always modified. Exterior folds vary from simple rounded to heavy, thick, rectanguloid and trianguloid bands. The flattened glcbular bowls, small collared jars, and beakers are typical shapes. Flattened bases may be either round or square. Wakulla Check Stamped28 (P1. XII, Fig. 1, C) is the marker type for Weeden Island II period. In ware qualities, it resembles the other Weeden Island types. It is decorated with a fine check stamp which virtually covers the vessel exterior. Squares are from 2 to 4 mm. and very lightly impressed with lands of equal width. Rims are usually folded, and long, flat folds are stamped over with the checking. Jars with 27 New type.

Wakulla Check Stamped is similar in surface treatment to most of the widespread check stamped types in the Southeast.29 Pottery Types of the Ft. Walton Period Ft. Walton Incised30 (P1. XII, Fig. 2, A, B, C and D; Fig. 27, G and H) is the diagnostic type of the Ft. Walton period. There is an important paste change from Weeden Island to Ft. Walton which is reflected in this type. Most of the Ft. Walton types are tempered with medium to large sized particles of quartzite and other grit. These particles usually extrude onto the surface. Decoration of Ft. Walton Incised is with wide and medium-wide, deep incised lines and dot and hollow reed punctations. Designs are applied to the exterior of casuelas, open bowls, or ollas with short collars. These designs are usually on the upper walls. The upper surfaces of triangular rim projections on shallow dish-like bowls are usually decorated. Three recognizable sub-styles are grouped under this type:31 (1) combined rectilinear and curvilinear elements forming very stylized anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures with punctations sparingly used;32 (2) curvilinear meander and other curvilinear and rectilinear patterns which are filled, or have the back- grounds filled, with punctations and, occasionally, hachure;33 (3) medium-fine incised lines grouped in threes or fours to form scrolls, diamonds, loops, or other combinations of curvilinear and rectilinear designs.34 In addition to the lateral rim projections on open dish-bowls, bird's heads and tails placed on opposite rims of open bowls, and small vertical lugs placed on the rim exterior just below the lip are noted as appendages.35 Safety Harbour Incised36 is tempered with fine sand in the Weeden Island fashion as opposed to the coarser grit temper of Ft.

[3, 1942 244</page><page sequence="16">WILLEY AND WOODBURY] NORTHWEST FLORIDA COAST Incised. Decoration is usually negative or positive meander, both rec- tilinear and curvilinear. Incising is fine lined; small dot punctates serve as design or background filler. The sureness of design of the old Weeden Island style has been replaced by a sloppy, careless execution. Safety Harbour Incised is not a common type along the northwest Florida coast, but its presence as a minority type of the Ft. Walton complex makes a cross-tie with the late pre-historic and proto-historic Safety Harbour culture farther south. According to Stirling,37 the Safety Harbour pottery extends as far south as the Caloosahatchie River, some little distance beyond the southern extent of the Weeden Island Types. The same author also points out that a pottery with Mississippian38 affinities is found in association with Safety Harbour as far south as this boundary. The Mississippian type (which he compares to Ford's "Tunican") he notes is more plentiful to the northwest. The Ft. Walton and Safety Harbour complexes are obviously of mixed origins, Mis- sissippian and local Floridian. The latter source is presumably Weeden Island. The two strains of influence are factored out when their features are summed up as pottery types: Ft. Walton Incised represents the Mississippian influences, in much greater intensity, which have been welded and reorganized, along with old local elements, into a new and unique type; Safety Harbour Incised, with much less of the Missis- sippian influence, carries on the old Weeden Island tradition in purer form farther to the south. Lake Jackson Plain (P1. XII, Fig. 2, G and H) is a tentative name given to a range of rim and appendage styles. The ware is grit tempered and resembles Ft. Walton Incised. Rim forms often flare or curve out above a neck constriction. Some rims are unmodified; others have a pinched or fluted rim fold or strap immediately beneath the lip. Small nodes applied in a row are often used in place of the fluting. The use of small vertical lugs, flush with or projecting above the rim, is a feature relating this type to Ft. Walton Incised. Both large loop and thick strap handles obtain as well as the small loop handles noted on Ft. Walton Incised and the shell tempered types. Nodes near the top of the handle are common. Lake Jackson Plain, on the basis of present survey data, is confined to the large mound group at Lake Jackson. Both plain and incised shell tempered pottery (P1. XII, Fig. 2, E and F) obtains from the northwest coast. It centers to the west towards Pensacola, but it is not absent entirely from the eastern 37 Stirling, 1936, p. 354. 38 In this context the term "Mississippian" has reference to pottery decoration and form styles which are most closely related to a "Middle Mississippian." The term "Lower Mississippian" has also been used to describe similar styles. 245</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY section. Form and decoration bear out the thesis that shell tempering is late in this region as in other parts of the Southeast. Both follow the Ft. Walton tradition in a number of respects. Additional forms and decoration styles more characteristically "Middle Mississippian" are illustrated by Moore. These vessels are apparently shell tempered. The frog bowl,39 the bottle,40 and the "Moundville" type of engraving4l on a jar are specific examples. The loop handles, also found on grit tempered wares, are a trait belonging to the general shell tempered pottery traditions to the north in the Mississippi Valley. Stratigraphically and typologically the shell tempered ware of the Gulf Coast belongs to the Ft. Walton period and culture. THE SITES The type descriptions are primarily based upon the pottery sherd collections gathered from eighty-seven sites, along the coast and inland, between the St. Marks River on the east and Pensacola Bay on the west. From the first, certain types and groups of types stood out as closely resembling types and type complexes from the adjacent areas (see chart, Fig. 25). In this manner, certain leads were offered which made it possible to temporarily formulate large typological units. For purposes of tracing distributions and for preliminary seriation, types were combined into the Deptford, Santa Rosa-Swift Creek, Weeden Island, and Ft. Walton complexes. Sixty-four sites which yielded sufficient sherd material, were assigned to a complex, or complexes, on the basis of the numerical and proportional strength of type sherds found at each site. After making these assignments, it was noted that the Deptford complex was found only to the east in Franklin and Wakulla counties.42 Swift Creek Complicated Stamped, and the related complicated stamped types, were found relatively "pure" on sites in Bay, Franklin, and Wakulla counties while in the west they were found mixed with Santa Rosa Stamped and the Marksville types. Sites on which Weeden Island Incised and other related types obtained were evenly dis- tributed all along the northwest coast section. This uniform distribu- tion also held for the Ft. Walton complex. The temporal relationships of the complexes were suggested by a study of the complex associations at the different sites. Sixty-one of the 39 Moore, 1901, Fig. 27. 40 Ibid., Fig. 82. 41 Ibid., Fig. 53. 42 Small amounts of the types Deptford Bold Check Stamped and Deptford Simple Stamped were found farther west. 246 [3, 1942</page><page sequence="18">WILLEY AND WOODBURY] NORTHWEST FLORIDA COAST sixty-four sites showed only one or two complexes.43 Their associations may be expressed in the following tabular form: Santa Rosa- Ft. Walton Weeden Island Swift Creek Deptford Ft. Walton 19 13 2 0 "pure sites" Weeden Island 13 20 3 0 "pure sites" Santa Rosa- 2 3 7 2 Swift Creek "pure sites" Deptford 0 0 2 0 "pure sites" These horizontal associations of complexes give indications of an overlapping series running from Deptford through Santa Rosa-Swift Creek, Weeden Island, and Ft. Walton in that order. There are two instances of association that do not agree with this seriation, that of the Ft. Walton and Santa Rosa-Swift Creek combinations. It should be pointed out that on the strength of these data alone, a Deptford complex could never have been postulated as the Deptford types were not isolated at any one site. It is here that direct'reference was made to an adjacent area. The time direction of the series is also forecast by the stratigraphic columns outside of the northwest Florida area. However, there is internal evidence for Ft. Walton being the "top" as early European contact material is found on Ft. Walton sites.44 Lake Jackson The Lake Jackson site is located on the edge of an old lake bed in the red clay hill country north of Tallahassee, Florida. There are six pyramidal, flat-topped mounds and one low, rounded formation which may be an artificial mound. Sherds and flint scrap are scattered over the village area between the mounds. Two pits 3 X 3 m were dug into the village area near the largest of the mounds. No physical or cultural differentiation was detected in a rich but relatively thin midden of about 50 cm in depth. Ft. Walton Incised, related types, Lake Jackson Plain, and a general, residual category of sand and grit tempered plain body sherds were the most common types. A few pieces of Safety Harbour Incised were recorded. 43 Of the remaining three sites, two had three complexes each, and one site had all four complexes represented in the surface collections. 44 Moore, 1901, pp. 423-432 and 473-496. 247</page><page sequence="19">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Carrabelle45 The Carrabelle site is more typical of the sites and area investi- gated during the season's survey. It is a shell midden on a low sand ridge extending along the Gulf Coast for about 200 m. The ridge lies some 70 or 80 m back from the present beach. The midden has been cut through by a railroad right-of-way which exposes one meter of mixed shell and black midden on each side of the embankment. Sherds were very abundant along this cut and on the surface. Five test blocks were excavated at random spots in the midden within a 50 m radius. These varied in depth from 60 to 100 cm, depending upon midden thickness. All material was removed in 10 cm levels. The gen- eral results of this stratigraphy may be seen on the chart (Fig. 26). By comparing type percentages from two of the blocks with those from the other three, a continuity, beginning with Deptford types and carrying well into Weeden Island can be reconstructed. Throughout, the appearance of a type or set of types seems to occur as a gradual replacement rather than as a sudden break. This is well illustrated by the life span of Weeden Island Incised overlapping the latter half of Swift Creek Complicated Stamped. Not only does this overlap indicate the contemporary existence of alien decoration techniques, but there is also evidence of cultural fusion as seen in the modification of Swift Creek rim forms to conform to Weeden Island styles. Despite the fact that Ft. Walton types were found scattered over the surface, this complex was not found in stratigraphic position, and Weeden Island marked the top of the excavated sequence at the site. The concept of Weeden Island II was not formalized until after the classification of materials from the Mound Field and Sowell excava- tions. Upon rechecking, it was noticed that Weeden Island II sherds were present in the Carrabelle surface collections; however, this period was not obtained stratigraphically in the excavated blocks. A peculiarity of the midden, associated with the first occurrence of the Weeden Island types, was the abrupt lessening of shell content in favor of black organic material with only a small admixture of shell. Animal and fish bones, another clue to food materials, continued in the same general proportions from Deptford through Weeden Island. This same phenomenon occured with the same cultural shift at the Mound Field site. 45 In most instances, sites selected for excavation were those showing two or more complexes in association in the surface collection. Carrabelle had all four represented. It should be made clear that this site does not tally with the location of a "Carrabelle" site listed by Moore in his 1918 report. Apparently this is not the same midden. [3, 1942 248</page><page sequence="20">WILLEY AND WOODBURY] NORTHWEST FLORIDA COAST Mound Field The Mound Field village occupation has approximately the same physical extent as that at Carrabelle. It is located on a sand knoll in a swamp, a few miles from the coast near the little hamlet of Spring Creek. A sand burial mound, in association with the village, was ex- cavated by Moore in 1901-1902.46 The occupied knoll is a few hundred meters from the burial mound. As there is no other village in the im- mediate vicinity, it seems likely that the mound dug by Moore was the mortuary mound built by the inhabitants of the shell midden. The midden is a mixture of shell and organic matter with shell more abun- dant in the lower levels, as at Carrabelle. Stratigraphy at Mound Field is based on results from two 3 X3 m blocks. Each was excavated in nine 10 cm levels. From a comparison of type frequencies by level with the Carrabelle site a case of vertical overlap between the two sites can be established. The Mound Field sequence has its inception in Swift Creek times, just previous to the advent of Weeden Island. A few sherds of the type Wakulla Check Stamped47 in the upper levels, and the greater amount of Weeden Island types, indicate that Mound Field was occupied through Weeden Island I and into the beginnings of Weeden Island II. Sowell At the Sowell site, on the west side of St. Andrews Bay, Wakulla Check Stamped is the dominant decorated type. This check stamped type is the most widespread type in northwest Florida, and, as indi- cated under the synoptic description of the type, has a close relation- ship to similar check stamped pottery throughout the southeastern United States. All present evidence, at Sowell, Mound Field, and at Ft. Walton, places Wakulla Check Stamped in what we have defined in this paper as Weeden Island II, that interval in the cultural con- tinuum where the complicated stamped types of the Swift Creek genre are dying out or have disappeared, and where the incised and punctate styles of Weeden Island are reaching a climax. Wakulla Check Stamped and Weeden Island Incised may reach a contemporary culmination; however, it is suggested that the check stamped type continues on into the Ft. Walton horizon. The upper levels of two pits at Sowell, excavated to total depths of 80 and 120 cm, show Ft. Walton Incised and plain shell tempered 4 Moore, 1902, pp. 306-320. Moore shows Weeden Island types from this mound. 47 The appearance of this type along with the disappearance of complicated stamped types marks the beginning of Weeden Island II. 249</page><page sequence="21">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ware. Neither of these types were found in the middle or lower levels in any appreciable quantity. Here, as at Ft. Walton and Gulf Breeze, the Ft. Walton period is represented by what seems to be only a very thin overlay intermixed with the upper portion of earlier refuse. It should be mentioned that Moore excavated a burial mound a few hundred meters from the Sowell midden. Materials from that mound agree with those found in the village except for the Ft. Walton types.48 Ft. Walton Near the eastern end of Santa Rosa Sound, on the mainland, is a large pyramidal mound with a flat top and an approach or ramp on the south side facing the Sound. The mound itself is some 100 m from the water's edge. Two modern highways pass on the south and north sides of the mound, and the modern city of Ft. Walton has grown up in the old village and partially destroyed the midden. Fronting on the beach, just south of the mound, is a shell midden on which a number of houses have been built. In one vacant lot, in which the midden appeared undisturbed, seven test blocks, varying in size from 3 to 1? meters square, were put down. Four of these blocks cut through at least 1.2 m of almost solid shell. Sherd material was not as abundant per level as at the Mound Field or Carrabelle sites. Alternate lensing of small clams and oyster shells was noted in the pit profiles, but cultural changes could not be correlated with these lenses. The earliest levels of the midden represented the Santa Rosa-Swift Creek period. This was succeeded by Weeden Island I and II, and Ft. Walton in this order. Deptford Bold Check Stamped and Deptford Simple Stamped were found in small quantities in the lower levels. These two types, on the basis of data from the Carrabelle site, overlap with, but have a slightly later climax than Deptford Linear Check Stamped (see Fig. 26). Material is insufficient to postulate a Dept- ford period at the site, although it would appear that these styles were dying out when Ft. Walton was first occupied. Swift Creek Complicated Stamped and the Marksville and Santa Rosa types occur coevally in the midden. This is the best data on the association of these two sets of types to form what has been called the Santa Rosa complex. Weeden Island Incised, Weeden Island Plain, and related types succeed the Santa Rosa complex. Wakulla Check Stamped reaches a quantitative maximum toward the upper end of the Weeden Island series, verifying the results from the Sowell site. Ft. Walton types come in only in the topmost levels. 48 Moore, 1902, pp. 167-174. 250 [3, 1942</page><page sequence="22">WILLEY AND WOODBURY] NORTHWEST FLORIDA COAST Moore's excavation49 into the big pyramidal mound at this site uncovered individual, and presumably intrusive, burials in the top of the mound. The pottery found with these burials is all of the Ft. Walton complex and quite comparable to that taken from the upper levels of the midden. Although Moore did not differentiate between Weeden Island and Ft. Walton incised types in text description, it is interest- ing to note that he specifically mentions no stamped sherds were found as grave offerings. A good number of stamped sherds were found in the fill of the mound. Moore interprets this as a difference between a cere- monial and a utilitarian ware.50 The appearance of stamped sherds in the body of the mound is not at all surprising in the light of the strati- fications from the associated midden. We may conclude that the Ft. Walton site was an occupation center long before the Ft. Walton period and the burial of the individuals with grave goods in the summit plateau of the mound. From other data it seems reasonable to assume that the pyramidal mound builders were of the Ft. Walton period and used the earlier refuse in constructing the mound.5' Gulf Breeze The Gulf Breeze site is one of several small midden accumulations on the low bank of the shore above the Gulf beach. It is near the western end of Santa Rosa Sound, a few miles east of Pensacola Bay bridge. Six small test pits were dug at this site. The only stratification was that of a sprinkling of shell and grit tempered Ft. Walton types over a mixture of Swift Creek and Marksville types. A very few Deptford sherds were associated with the Swift Creek and Marksville mixture. The midden was mixed shell and organic matter. It averaged only 70 to 80 cm in depth. The surface collection data, showing the absence of both periods of Weeden Island, was verified in the digging. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION In summary, our earliest evidences for human occupation along the northwest Florida coast are of a people living on the beaches, bay shores, and rivers, and depending upon shellfish for a major portion of their diet. Animals, birds, fish, and reptiles also served as foods. These people, whom we may call the "Deptford," made a coiled, sand 4" Moore, 1901, pp. 435-454. In 1900 the name of the town was "Camp Walton," Moore uses this name. 60 Ibid., pp. 438-439. 61 Moore, 1901, p. 454. In this connection it should be noted that a small conical sand mound (probably of the Weeden Island type) once existed in the immediate vicinity but was destroyed previous to Moore's visit to the site. 251</page><page sequence="23">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY tempered pottery which they decorated with rather simple forms of impressions or stamping such as linear check and plain linear grooves. As in all periods on this coast, stone artifacts were scarce; but a few large, triangular-bladed projectile points, with and without barbs, pebble hammerstones, and small flat whetstones can be identified as of the Deptford period. Nothing is known of the type of dwelling used or of the methods of burial. Because of the types of pottery always found in association with the burial mounds in this region, it seems safe to assume that the Deptford people did not build artificial mounds. This assumption is strengthened by the fact that artificial mounds have not been satisfactorily associated with the Deptford culture as it is found on the Georgia coast. The Deptford culture, either by a movement of peoples or by diffusion, probably came into northwest Florida from centers on the south Atlantic coast. Nothing is known of pre-Deptford times in north- west Florida although it is possible that people making fibre tempered pottery had inhabited the region as they did the south Atlantic coast. Regardless of what happened earlier, the Deptford culture continued for an unknown span of time in the Apalachee-Apalachicola Bay country. A change is marked by the introduction of complicated stamped pottery, principally of the Swift Creek type. Again little is known of the movements of peoples. Excavation shows a pottery which is deco- rated in a sophisticated manner, and this pottery is more abundant than the earlier Deptford pottery. FYagments of two ground stone axes or celts were found in Swift Creek association. Otherwise there were no significant differences found between the stone artifacts of Swift Creek and Deptford. Shellfish gathering presumably remained the basic economy. There are no data as to houses or burial types in the Apala- chee-Apalachicola section. The origins of Swift Creek are obscure; however, the Swift Creek type of pottery seems to center in central or south Georgia. Hence, it is possible that Swift Creek came into west Florida from the north. Its spread after reaching the Gulf Coast was most certainly from the Apalachee-Apalachicola region to the west. Around St. Andrews Bay, and to the west, the presence of Marks- ville pottery in association with the Swift Creek forms the Santa Rosa complex. Although proof is not conclusive, there is a suggestion that the burial mound idea, for the interment of great numbers of secondary and flexed burials, came into northwest Florida at this time. Moore illustrates and describes Swift Creek and other early complicated stamped pottery and variant Marksville styles from burial mounds in 252 [3, 1942</page><page sequence="24">WILLEY AND WOODBURY] NORTHWEST FLORIDA COAST the Santa Rosa area.52 None of the later Weeden Island types are shown from these mounds. In Weeden Island we come to the climax period of the northwest Florida coast. Sites are exceedingly numerous. Conical sand burial mounds, so often described by Moore, are a common feature of the culture. The pottery of this period has close relationships to the Troy- ville and Coles Creek pottery of the lower Mississippi Valley but is uniquely Floridian. Although the burial mound collections show a number of unusual objects other than pottery artifacts, the village middens yield little more than in the previous periods. An occasional shell pendant, quartz crystal fragments, pieces of mica, and celt frag- ments are all that were found in the excavation of four sites which had Weeden Island occupations. Large stemmed projectiles continue in Weeden Island. One small, triangular Mississippian type point was found. No houses or burials were encountered, but the associated burial mounds explain the absence of skeletal material in the middens. It is possible that the Marksville-Troyville stream of influence brought horticulture into west Florida at this time. Nevertheless, the coastal environment, with its unsuitable sandy soil but stable supply of shell- fish, probably acted as a deterrent to intensive horticulture. Weeden Island II is divided from Weeden Island I on the basis of pottery changes. The reemergence of check stamped pottery after a long period of its absence in northwest Florida may indicate a revival of influence from the east. During the Swift Creek period this check stamped tradition had been abandoned. Later, Swift Creek had been partly replaced and modified by the strong western influences which formed the Weeden Island culture. This western tradition continues in Weeden Island II, but appears to be losing some of its vigor with the advent of Wakulla Check Stamped. This is the ceramic history and picture at the time of the influx of new elements which, in part, make up Ft. Walton. These foreign elements in Ft. Walton probably found their way down the southward flowing rivers of Alabama to the northwest Florida coast. This may have been an invasion of peoples as well as the transmission of cultural influences. In time, it correlates with the mass Mississippian invasion of the eastern part of the Southeast. The idea of the pyramidal, flat-topped temple mound, as opposed to the small, conical, sand burial mound, is a part of this new culture. There are new pottery types reminiscent of Middle Mississippi. Yet this was not a 52 Moore, 1902, "Alligator Bayou" p. 150 ff., and "Anderson's Bayou" p. 160 ff. 253</page><page sequence="25">254 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [3, 1942 complete cultural replacement. Ft. Walton represents a fusion of the new influences with the old traditions of Weeden Island. It was during this time that European trade goods began to filter in to the Indians. Some of the Ft. Walton sites show such artifacts as European metal and glass beads; others do not. The culture, from archaeological evidence, does not appear to have been broken at this time. Spanish colonization and missionization of the Indians of west Florida may have begun, but had not yet reached its peak. Although a thorough documentary identification of sites is needed to substantiate it, a belief that the Ft. Walton sites on the northwest coast of Florida were the villages of the Apalachee and other southern Muskhogean speaking'tribes, during the seventeenth century, seems reasonable on present evidence.
