<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kuy, the Owl of Omen and War Nikolai Grube and Linda Scheie This essay is on the reinterpretation of the owl as a bird of omen and war. The owl is commonly referred to as the "Muan bird". However, there is no evidence that the owl in Maya iconogra phy was called muan. A clear distinction has to be made between the month name Muan and the owl, which was called kuy and was a bird associated with war. The same iconograph ie complex is found in Teotihuacán and Cacaxtla in associa tion with war and représentations of merchants. Scheie and Freidel (1990) associated a symbol of an spearthrower and owl on the Tikal Marcador (Fig. la-c) with the Tlaloc/Venus complex and identified its substitution as the spearthrower/shield symbol that occurs several times on Tikal Stela 31 (Fig. ld). Following their lead, Mathews (in Scheie and Mathews 1990) pointed out that the shield on Stela 31 has T528 "kawak" infixed into its center. He noted that "kawak" is phonetic ku and that the Cordemex dictionary (Barrera Vásquez 1980:342) glosses ku, kuh, and kuy as "owl of omen." He suggested that the substitution of the owl for the shield was a phonetic. Besides Yukatek, the same gloss is found in Chol and Tzeltal dictionaries for "owl" (Chol: xcu "lechuza", Aulie and Aulie 1978: 134; Tzeltal: xcuj "lechuza", Slocum and Gerdel 1971: 202). Grube and MacLeod took the reading one step farther by identifying the glyph version of the owl as phonetic ku. Grube noted in a 1990 letter to MacLeod that the owl with the tri-foil eye on the Marcador (Fig. la) was the same a substitution for ki that Stuart had identified in the Copan location ox-witik (Fig. le-f). In 1991, he extended this substitution pattern to include the Caracol emblem glyph (Fig. lg-h), while Scheie (1990) showed that the tri-foil-eyed owl occurred the Substitute for the impinged bone (Fig. li-j). MacLeod (1991) put these patterns together and showed that this owl functions as phonet ic ku throughout the writing system. She also read the im pinged bone glyph as kun, "seat," based on kunil, "platforma para maíz" in Chol (Aulie and Aulie 1978:39). Our own research has confirmed these readings and iden tified the principal name of this war owl as kuy. Previously, the horned owl has been read as muwan based on the arguments</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1.

Until présent, almost all représentations of owls in Maya iconography are called "Muan birds" (Taube 1992:81 -88). Thompson ignored the seperation made by Seier (1923: 609-616) between the screech owl and the Muan bird of the 15th month. Also, Seier calis to attention that muan does not mean "owl" in any Mayan language1. At the same time Thompson dismissed Schellhas' (1897) earlier citation of cui as owl. In a discussion of a Late Classic polychrome ceramic style from Central Campeche called Cui Orange Polychrome, Joseph Ball (1975: 33) points out that the bird depicted on the Cui Orange Polychrome plates is not the Moan bird, but the Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) (Blake 1953: 216-217). Ball notes the close association of this owl with death and that the polychrome plates on which it is painted were all found in funerary contexts. Barrera Vásquez glosses moan as "patronímico Maya, una forma de muan." For muan, he gives "[pájaro mitológico] probablemente sea una especie de buho . . . moan: según Refugio Vermont Salas existe un ave negra parecida al pich' (Dives, Dives) que en Cantamayek (Yucatán) es conocida con el nombre de moan" (Barrera Vás quez 1980: 531-532). Pich' is a glossed elsewhere as "ave clari nero" (Barrera Vásquez 1980: 652). As far as we can find, there is no evidence of a moan or muan term for "owl" in Yukatek. How ever, muhan is the Mopan word (according to personal communi cation by Rómulo Aurelio Ca'al Acaljá of San Luis, Peten) for "gavilán." Moran's Cholti dic tionary gives muhan as "gavilán, milano" (Moran 1695: 23). And Wisdom (n.d.: 531) gives Chorti muahn as "hawk (generic gavi lán). As far as we can teil, there are no confirmed entries for muan or moan as "owl" in any Mayan lan guage. There can be no doubt, however, that the ñame of the fif teenth month was pronounced muan. Purely syllabic spellings (Fig2e) confirmthat the more com mon hieroglyph for the month, the head of a bird with a prominent beaked nose (Fig. 2a-c) indeed was read muwan. However, the bird of the fifteenth month - the only real Muan bird - always has suffixes emerging from its beak; sometimes they are the tips of feathers, in other cases, the suffix seems to be a pair of hands. Often, syllabic ni or na are attached as phonetic com pléments to the bird head (Fig. 2b, d, f). The Muan bird of the month ñame thus is clearly différent from the kuy owl in Maya iconography.

The glyph for the month Muan. a) Yaxchilan Lintel 35, D4; b) Caracol Ballcourt Marker 3, D3; c) Palenque Bodega 474; d) Tor tuguero Monument 6, Fl; e) Dresden 46c; f ) Bonampak Stela 1, H3, here Muan is part of the ruler's name. (All drawings by Nikolai Grube). 11</page><page sequence="3">The Muan bird is not an owl, but, as the glosses from the dictionaries prove, a hawk. The name of the month may also be related to the term moan k' in "día nublado y lloviznoso" cited in the Pió Pérez dictionary of Yukatek Maya (Pió Pérez 1866-1877). This leaves Schellhas' original gloss as kuy as the most likely candidate as the name of the owl of the inscriptions. We feel that the iconographie identification of this bird as an owl is secure. It characteristically has a feather horn like owl, as well as a feather extending from its forehead, a raptor's beak, and a feather-fringe around its jaw. No other bird has this Cluster of features. Moreover, the owl regularly has the black tipped feathers that are usually called Muan bird feathers. We now identify these black-tipped feathers with the owl. The most telling evidence comes from the Dresden Codex and two vases depicting wayob of various types. The owl is first of all shown as the headdress of God L on page 74 (Fig. 3). Here the bird has a raptor' s beak, a black shape around its eyes, and a black-tipped feather on its wing. This same bird occurs in God L's headdress in Classic-period imagery where the name Oxlahun-Chan (or Kan), "Thirteen Sky," is attached to ^ v.. Fig. 3. Dresden 74 (from Villacorta and Villacorta 1977). his head (Fig. 6). The God L owl can thus be identified with the name "Thirteen-SkyHelga-Maria Hartig has shown that this expression in the Motul dictionary is glossed as "luna llena, oposición" (Hartig 1980: 81). Perhaps this title represents a still unknown aspect of God L's owl. This same glyphic name recurs with an owl on Dresden 1 Oa, above a scene showing our bird with a human body seated in a cross-legged position (Fig. 4b). The text consists of an undeciphered verb, followed by tu chich, and the name of the bird. The first of his ñames is Oxlahun-Kanal ("Thirteen Sky"), while the second is clearly phonetic ku-yu or kuy. The last two glyph of the text record the prognostication as u muk tok'-te'-ba, that seems to be of negative character. The same bird reappears on Dresden 7c where he is again named Oxlahun-Kan Kuy and given a negative prognostica tion (Fig. 4a). The signs in the kuy are reversed (yu-ku), but we feel the kuy spelling was intended. The owl occurs on Dresden 16c as one of the mutob, "birds," that sit on the Moon Goddess's head (Fig. 4c). Here it is called Oxlahun "Owl" with the Kan Kuy part of the name contained in a portrait of the bird's head. Fig. 4. The kuy owl in the Codices, a) Dresden 7c; b) Dresden 10a; c) Dresden 18b; d) Dresden 43c; e) Madrid 95c (all from Villacorta and Villacorta 1977). The only other occurrence of the bird in the Dresden is found on page 43c, which shows Chak rowing a canoe (Fig. 4d). God L's bündle and owl headdress sit in its prow. No name is given to the bird, but it has the same black eye patch as the bird in God L's headdress on page 74. Madrid 94-95c shows the moon goddess with bird prog nostications. The second on M95c is a owl turning its face front view to the page. The name of this bird is i-ki, perhaps a shortened spelling of ikim "una de las aves agoreras que temen los indios", (Barrera Vásquez 1980: 265) and we think ku-yu is written in the next glyph (Fig. 4e). A pot published in Coe (1982: Pl. 58) depicts a convention of wayob (Grube and Nahm 1993). Two birds float above the</page><page sequence="4">scene. One is a skeletalized tun-bird while the other is an owl one of the sentences spoken by the participants in the drinking with a snake twisted around its neck (Fig. 5a). The name scene includes the front view of the owl head as its second phrase juxtaposed to this owl reads kuy u way chan y o ??? ba glyph (Fig. 5c). Ku precedes the name as a phonetic comple (or/ja) "£ny is the animal companion spirit of yo ???ba". The ment. owl is clearly named kuy. The scenes on Kerr 1398 is one of the most revealing of the Fig. 5. The kuy owl on ceramics. a) Coe 1982: No. 58; b) Coe 1982: No. 15; c) Kerr 1989: File No. 1092; (drawings by Nikolai Grube). bird (Fig. 6). The scenes show a rabbit who has taken the clothes from God L. He holds the god's headdress out in one scene where the name Oxlahun-Kan is clearly visible on the bird. So are the black tipped feathers so characteristic of the créature. The text begins with the date 13 Ok 18 Wo. The next glyph is the brocket deer that can Substitute for "day" in distance num bers. The text continues with ni ch'am-wa ni kuy yitah Bolon Yokte K' u, "I took my owl, the companion of Bolon-Yokte god." This phrase identifies the owl as the "compan ion" of the god called Bolon-Y okte, who was an important god whose portrait has not been securely iden tified. However, he is named as one of the gods of K'atun 11 on Dresden 60. Of the three beings shown on this page that might represent Bolon Yokte, all have owl feathers, war imagery, and carry weapons. To us, This same owl with the snake necklace recurs on a "Codex thissupportstheoriginalidentificationoftheowl-spearthrower style" ceramic without a name (Fig. 5b). However, its mouth symbol with warfare. is open and it emits a black-faced god that is surely God L. We The presence of kuy in the early texts at Tikal confirms this think that the Oxlahun-Kan-Kuy owl was the avatar of God L, association with war. Stela 31 gives the most pertinent exam just as the bird on the top of the World Tree is the avatar of ple. The text from D19-C24 records events in the Tikal Itzamna. Another well-known polychrome bowl (Kerr 1989: Uaxactun war. We think that the first half of the phrase records File No. 1092) does not include an illustration of the owl, but the destruction of places and/or patrons gods in the form of Fig. 6. The taking of the God L regalia on Kerr 1398.

The following phrase begins with a répétition of these war events as the base of a count leading to a building dedication. The glyph used to reiterate the war is spelledyu-ku-te (Fig. 7a). A second répétition at F21 reverses the spelling to ku-yu-te (Fig. 7b). Fahsen and Scheie (1991), who first identified this substitution, chose the first spelling, but we know think the second is the correct one. We suggested that kuyte is a word for the war. Recently, Jürgen Kremer2 obtained information from Yukatek Maya at Telchaquillo, Yucatán, that kuy or ah kuy is one of the words for "warrior" in the local dialect of Yukatek. One of a pair of celts and a set of ear spools believed to have been looted from Río Azul also make reference to kuyte, perhaps as a title for an overlord from Tikal. The earspools record the name of a person we think may be from Tikal. At least, the name occurs on Stela 3 as the name of the king of Tikal at 9.2.13.0.0 (Scheie 1990: 45). The second of the two earflares was owned by a person who called himself "the vassal of ' (yahaw) a lord named "west chakte war owl" (och k'in chakte' kuy ???) (Fig. 7e). His affiliation is given as a title associated with God A', ch'ul chafan winik mas ahaw, "holy blind center person duende lord." Plaque 1 of the two that may be from Río Azul also records a subordínate clause for its owner here as yahaw ku-y(a)teku chan, "the vassal of the owl staff, owl sky" (Fig. 7d). We think this object is actually the staff the protagonist holds in his hands. It is a serpent bar, but with the upper snake head d W gj— m Fig. 7. ku-yu-te glyphs associated with war in Tikal and Río Azul, a) Tikal St. 31, D19-D25 (drawing by John Montgomery); b) Tikal Stela 31, E20-F23 (drawing by John Montgomery); c) The jaguar with owl featherheaddress, "Rio Azul Plaque 1" (drawing by Nikolai Grube); d) yahaw kuyte ku chan "the ahaw of kuyte owl sky", "Rio Azul Plaque 1", B9-B10 (drawing by Nikolai Grube); e) The "Spear thrower-shield"-title on an earspool supposed to be from Rio Azul (drawing by Nikolai Grube). replaced by a miniature jaguar wearing a panache of owl feathers (Fig. 7c). The owl feathers mark the object as a kuy. We also note that the main Figure, who is marked with a k' in sign on his face, wears a bar and trapeze war sign in his helmet. Captives flank the object on which he stands so that the regalía he holds and wears reflects his association with war. These black-tipped owl feathers regularly mark warrior images. They are especially prévalent in the headdresses on the warrior monuments at Piedras Negras and in the battle murais at Cacaxtla. A full-bodied kuy owl is regularly worn in the Tla loc-Venus costume, and is especially featured at Aguateca and Dos Pilas (Fig. 8). Hasso von Winning (1948) was the first to identify the motif "owl-arrows-and-hand-in shield" that oc curs on Teotihuacan figurines, wall paintings and pottery Fig. 8.

Probably, the association of the kuy owl with war originated at Teotihuacan and later became a pan-Mesoamerican motif (von Winning 1985: 59-74). Fig. 9. The owl in association with warrior costume in Teotihuacan imagery. a) Clay figure (Drawing by Linda Scheie); b) Plano-relief vase from Santiago Ahuizotla (von Winning 1985: Fig. 71); c) Wall painting from Tepantitla, Patio 9 (Miller 1973: Fig. 193). This owl-war complex is also profoundly associated with the chak-te or "batab" title first identified by Berlin (1958: 114). Scheie and Villela (1992) have associated accession into this title and the owl-war title with the T713/757 accession expres sion. At Tikal, all of the accessions clearly associated with the high king (that is, on monuments found in the center plazas of the city) involved this office. The high king of Tikal held the chakte-ship of the kingdom (see Fahsen and Scheie 1991, and Scheie and Fahsen 1991) while the rulers of other site as well as the lineage heads of Tikal held a/tawships. We think this reflects Tikal's early success on conquest warfare. The com bination of the owl with the Tlaloc costume of the conquest iconography is especially well illustrated in a pot published in Robicsek and Haies (1981 :P1. 107), which shows the war serpent called Waxaklahun-Ubah-Chan conflated with a year sign. A maie figure sits atop this symbol holding a snake staff and wearing a balloon headdress. Black-tipped owl feathers arch from the back of his belt. The same owl feathers regularly appear in the headdresses of Tlaloc-costumed warrior kings in the imagery of Piedras Negras and other sites. Besides "owl" and "war," kuy has several other meanings or close dérivations that relate to its context in the inscriptions and Classic imagery. Barrera Vasquez (1980:357-358) lists kuyiï as "breast armor", a meaning that may be related to the shields that often occur with the owl. Laughlin ( 1988:226) lists kuy as "mention, name, relate personal histories (especially the old people), say, tell stories" and kuyel as "story." We have at least one context from Copan where this last meaning is especially appropriate. God L, who seems to be the anthropomorphic avatar of the kuy owl, is clearly an important god in the Maya Otherworld. He was most likely a sorcerer and his image on page 74 of the Dresden shows him carrying war implement (Fig. 3). On the Tablet of the Sun at Palenque, he is one of two gods who support a throne bearing the GUI shield. Thompson (1950:76 77) discussed two black gods who appear in the Madrid Codex with scorpion tail. While both had been earlier identified with Ek' Chuwah, "Black Scorpion," the god of cacao and mer chants, Thompson distinguished them. One of them appears on Madrid 32 with shield, ax, and lance; on M33a with shield and ax; and on M33b with ax and torch. On 79a-84a, he appears with a scorpion tail, which holds the rope binding a captive on M79-80a. In these last two scenes, the god wears a headdress of muan feathers and on M81 a, he appears with God L's glyphic name. On M109, this black god has the eye of God M and the owl headdress of God L. At least in the Madrid Codex, God M and GodL cannot be easily distinguished. Most important to our argument, Cacaxtla shows God L complete with his owl headdress and a huge merchant's pack that is usually associated with God M (Fig. 10). Fig. 10. God L as an itinérant trader at Cacaxtla. (Drawing by Nikolai Grube after Stuart and Stuart 1993: 199.) 15</page><page sequence="7">16 That site is replete with the imagery of Tlaloc-Venus warfare in the Maya mode. God L was apparently an important deity in that complex and we suspect that he was the famous Ek' Chuwah. This association of the owl and the Tlaloc-Venus war complex with merchant's may go back as early as the Tikal Uaxactun war. Problematical Deposit 50 at Tikal had a famous vase showing a group of people dressed in the Teotihuacan version of the costume Walking toward a Maya temple and a building with a talud-tablero platform (Scheie and Freidel 1990: Fig. 4:26). Coggins (1976) first interpreted this scene as one showing a Teotihuacan embassy arriving at Tikal via Kaminaljuyu. Scheie and Freidel (1990) accepted this inter prétation, while doubting the Kaminaljuyu part of the story. We think this scene may show a pochteca kind of group arriving from Central Mexico and is thus the counterpart to the God L scene at Cacaxtla. These commercial groups not only were spearheads for conquest and domination, but also carri ers of ideas, rituals, and beliefs. We think the Teotihuacan type imagery was involved in this kind of exchange. References cited Aulie, H. Wilbur, and Evelyn W. de Aulie 1978 Diccionario Ch'ol-Espafiol: Español-Ch'ol.

"Es ist ganz inkorrekt, wenn Stempeil daraufhin, dass die Gestalt dieses mythologischen Vogels vielleicht aus der Darstellung der Eule erwachsen ist, das Wort moan oder muan als Name der Ohreule, oder des Uhus angibt. Das Wort moan bezeichnet nur den Zeitabschnitt, wird zum wenigsten jetzt nirgends zur Benennung des Vogels verwendet und ist vermutlich auch zu keiner Zeit der Name dieses Vogels gewesen" (Seier 1923: 614). 2. Personal communication to Grube, October 1993. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Die Eule als Omen und Zeichen für Krieg bei den Klassischen Maya. Der Beitrag räumt mit der in der Fachliteratur weitverbreiteten Meinung auf, der Muan-Vogel sei eine Eule, und alle Eulen seien Muan-Vögel. In der klassischen Maya-Ikonographie kommen zwar viele Eulen vor, diese werden jedoch kuy genannt, ein Wort für "Eule" in den meisten Tieflandssprachen. Das Wort muan bedeutet nicht Eule, sondern einen Sperber. Zwar lautet der Name des 15. Monats im Haab tatsächlich muwan, die entsprechende Hieroglyphe zeigt jedoch einen anderen Vogelkopf, der nicht mit dem der kuy-Eule identisch ist. Die kuy-Eule erscheint in der Ikonographie als Kopfschmuck von Gott L, aber auch als Attribut von Kriegern. Die Verbindung von Eulen mit Kriegsikonographie geht zurück auf Teotihuacan. In Cacaxtla gibt es eine Darstellung von Gott L als reisender Händler. Die Autoren vermuten, daß der ikonographische Komplex Krieger/ Eulen über den Handel mit Zentralmexiko in das Mayagebiet gelangte, wo er zum ersten Mal während des Krieges von Tikal gegen Uaxactun auftritt. RESUMEN: Kuy, la lechuza agorera y símbolo de guerra en la época clásica maya. Esta contribución no comparte la opinión general que pretende que el pájaro Muan es igual a la lechuza y que todas las lechuzas son pájaros Muanes. La iconografía del Clásico nos da varios ejemplos de lechuzas, pero bajo el nombre de kuy, la palabra para "lechuza" en la mayoría de los idiomas de las Tierras Bajas. La palabra "muan" significa "gavilán" y no "lechuza". A pesar de que el nombre del décimo quinto mes del Haab see "muwan", el glifo correspondiente muestra otro tipo de cabeza de pájaro que no es idéntico con el de la lechuza. La lechuza kuy aparece en la iconografía como tocado de cabeza del Dios L, pero también como atributo guerrero. La relación entre las lechuzas y la iconografía guerrera tiene su principio en Teotihuacán. En Cacaxtla el Dios L se presenta en forma de comerciante viajero. Los autores suponen que el complejo iconográfico guerrero/lechuza penetró el area maya, donde se presenta por primera vez durante la guerra de Tikal contra Uaxactun, por medio del comercio con la zona central mexicana.
