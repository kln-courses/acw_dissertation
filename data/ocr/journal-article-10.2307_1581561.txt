<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DIVINITY AMONG THE LUGBARA BY A.T. DALFOVO (Makerere University, Kampala) The approach to this analysis is mainly linguistic, focusing on the terms used to designate the divinity among the Lugbara.' It probes into the meaning of these terms both in their past and i*i their present con- text, highlighting their evolution and the endogenous and exogenous factors that have influenced it. The study considers some contrasting dualisms that were part of this meaning and the way in which the implied dilemmas were solved. Some considerations relating to the methodological approach to similar analyses conclude the article. 1. Words and Concepts: Exogenous and Endogenous Views At first sight, the Lugbara language seems to have more than one term referring to the divinity. This variety of terms poses the question concerning their meaning, namely whether the various terms express one or several meanings. A survey of the main historical sources that have dealt with this issue suggests that initially the terms described the same reality but later were understood as having two related meanings. The most significant authors who dealt with this problem were McConnell, Ramponi, Middleton and Crazzolara, to whom the authors- translators of the book O'duko Moke(ri) have to be added. The tradi- tional terms referring to the divinity quoted in these sources were Adro, Adroa and Adronga, to which Ramponi added Adrogo and Adrogoa. McConnell's early article of 1925 mentioned indistinctly Adro, Adroa and Adronga giving to all of them the attribute of God.2 Hence he did not differentiate among the meaning of the terms which, in his opinion, referred indistinctly to the same reality. Ramponi was the first to attempt an explanation of traditional ter- minology related to the divinity. Writing in 1937, he spoke of Adro, Adroa, Adronga, Adrogo and Adrogoa, clarifying their meanings as follows: C Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 1998 Journal of Relgion in Africa, XXVIII, 4</page><page sequence="2">Diviniy among the Lugbara 'Other spirits, they believe, exist, which are not those of the dead, and these are called Adrogo or Adro.... Besides all these, there is the great one called, Adronga or Adroa or Adrogoa.'3 Hence, according to Ramponi, some terms referred to God and others to the spirits; namely Adroa, Adronga and Adrogoa applied to God and Adro and Adrogo to the other spirits. Middleton in 1955 wrote of Adro, Adroa and Adronga. He explained that the Lugbara 'conceive him (God) as having two aspects, one tran- scendent and the other immanent. The transcendent aspect is usually named Adroa or Adronga, forms which are diminutives of Adro, which is used for the immanent aspect.... The transcendent aspect is God in the sky (Adroa 'bua), and is usually called 'ba o'bapiri, the creator of men.... It is in his immanent aspect that God comes into direct con- tact with his creatures during their lifetimes. Adro lives on earth, espe- cially in rivers. He is also found in large trees and thickets and on high mountains and rocky places.... Lugbara speak of him as one but many.... He is said to be formed like a man, and very tall and white; but his body is cut down the centre and he has only one eye, one ear, one arm and one leg.'4 Middleton then retained Adro to be the imma- nent God, while Adroa or Adronga was the transcendent God. That dis- tinction between the immanent and transcendent aspects of God has had authoritative following.5 In 1960, Crazzolara wrote of adro, adroa or iyi adro (all initials are in lower case) explaining them as a 'water-ghost... who is believed to dwell in rivers; it... catches people and makes them sick; the spirit is described as having a large head with long hair; with only one eye, ear, nostril, arm, leg; there are several kinds of them.' The same author then listed the name Adro (with capital initial) describing the term as 'God (the Creator), divinity; Adro 'ba o'bapiri namely God who created man.'6 Crazzolara attributed to Adro the meaning of God and to adro and adroa that of spirits. The book O'duko Moke(ri), published in 1971, used only Adro and Adroa giving to each of them distinct meanings.7 Adro was referred to the idea of the one God, and Adroa to that of the spirits. The first chapter of this book dedicated to the one and supreme God, began: 'Our ancestors knew in the past that Adro existed. For instance: on the birth of a new child, they gave thanks to Adro.... When someone fell sick, they killed a cow so that Adro could help that person to get rid of his sickness.'8 The term Adro in the above quoted context was used in the singular. The second chapter of the same book, dedicated to the spirits, the angels and the devils, opened as follows: 'People think that 469</page><page sequence="3">A.T. Dafovo there are good and bad Adroa. The good Adroa save us from bad things.... Adro created all Adroa that people call Malaika (Kiswahili for "spirits").'9 Adroa was here used in the plural and it applied to spirits lower than Adro. In O'duko Moke(ri), Adro was the high God and Adroa were the good and bad spirits. The above authors exemplify the way foreign observers perceived the divinity among the Lugbara. The various terms and concepts dis- covered by those observers led them to introduce clarifications and dis- tinctions which, as it happens in similar exercises, may result from objective observation but also from subjective interpretation. First of all, it has clearly emerged that the various terms expressing the divinity are dialectal variations of the same term in the language and therefore that the meaning expressed by them in all its complexity needs to be referred to one term.'? The dialectal variations of the Lugbara language are several and rather difficult to classify as it cannot be clearly ascertained at which stage the variations of the language create a dialect within it." The fundamental dialectal difference on which there is general agreement is the one associated to the west with Ayivu County and to the east with Terego County. In this differentiation, Vurra and Maracha Counties are connected to Ayivu, while Aringa County is sometimes associated with Terego and sometimes considered a separate dialectal zone. Tucker and Bryan refer to these dialectal areas as the cluster of the 'High' Lugbara and that of the 'Low' Lugbara.12 This nomenclature is derived from the Lugbara words urule'ba literally meaning 'upper people' and andrele'ba 'lower people.' The specifications 'high' and 'low' or 'upper' and 'lower' refer to geographical positions. Crazzolara translates the terms urule'ba and andrele'ba more appropriately as 'high-land people' and 'low-land people.'"3 These terms are combined into urule'ba ti and andrele'ba ti, namely 'the language (ti) of the urule'ba' and 'of the andrele'ba' respectively, which indicates how the Lugbara themselves make this dual distinction in their language. The three main. terms referred to the divinity in the above quoted sources belong to the various dialectal areas as follows: Adro to Ayivu, Adroa to Terego and Adronga to Aringa. Adrogo and Adrogoa mentioned only by Ramponi pertain to areas bordering with the Madi. Traditionally, each dialectal area had only one term for the divinity, the one proper to its respective dialect. This is significantly confirmed by the language used in proverbs, songs and fables and in personal names: in each of these instances, the name of the divinity is the dialectal variation of the area from which the proverbs, songs, fables and personal names 470</page><page sequence="4">Divinity among the Lugbara originate.'4 The following extracts of two interviews held at Omugo in Terego County and at Usukui in Ayivu County exemplify these dialec- tal variations. At Omugo, a group of elders asserted: 'Adroa is very much used here. Adroa are many. They have their families, made up of husbands, wives and children. Adroa may also be just one in a cer- tain river. Besides rivers, the Adroa inhabit trees, either one big tree or a cluster of them. From these trees nothing may be collected not even a twig. The person doing so will be struck by the Adroa inhabiting it.' At Usukui, other elders reported: 'Adro, this is the term we use here. Adroa is down there (pointing to Terego). People thought of many Adro in rivers and among trees. Some of the Adro were snakes; others were like men, perhaps with only one leg or one eye. These Adro can also leave their place and come out, going around. The Adro in rivers were given offerings: eggs, small chicks, ashes.' The difference in the two sto- ries is substantially only in the term Adroa used in the first story and Adro used in the second one. What is Adroa in Omugo is Adro in Usukui. And when talking with people of Aringa area, the terms Adro and Adroa became Adronga. The explanation of the various terms of the divinity as given above by Ramponi, Middleton, Crazzolara and O'duko Moke(ri) were prompted by a need to clarify and systematize words and concepts. This led observers to relate one word to one concept as if the variety of words expressed a variety of concepts and the task was simply to discover which word related to which concept. There were several ideas about the divinity in traditional culture and thought. Some of them appeared to be so contradictory that they could not be referred to the same term. Thus, for example, it was considered impossible that Adro could mean both one God and many Gods or both an immanent and a tran- scendent God. The presence of what appeared to be different words referring to the divinity made those observers think that such words had some reference to the different or contrasting meanings related to the divinity. The result of that assumption is seen in the above quoted sources which explain Adro to be the high God and Adroa to be the spirits, or Adro to be the immanent aspect of God and Adroa to be the transcendent. Today, these distinctions of words and meanings are sink- ing more and more into the culture of the people such that the younger, largely Christian, generations hold such distinctions to be inherent to Lugbara language and traditional thought. To conclude, it may be said that although past Lugbara thinking and language do not support the way the terms are understood today, such understanding has roots in past culture and ideas. The present 471</page><page sequence="5">A.T. Dalfovo meaning attached to these terms has developed from meanings that the terms had in tradition. An impact on such development was also con- tributed by exogenous influences derived from foreign observers and from the new religions of Christianity and Islam. All that has had an influence on Lugbara culture and it posed a challenge to it. Any inter- pretation of the way words are used now needs to take the historical development into account. 2. Some Underlying Dualisms The previous section on words and concepts has hopefully helped to elucidate the problem of terms. That of meanings, instead, needs some further clarification, as what has been so far considered has high- lighted some contrasting and unresolved dualisms in meaning that touch on questions related to the nature of the divinity. The questions are whether the divinity is traditionally considered as a singular or as a plural entity since people speak of Adro, Adroa and Adronga as being both one and many. Another dilemma related to this of monism or plural- ism is the one between the immanent and the transcendent aspects of Adro and Adroa. These aspects could be thought of as distinct ways of being and thus implying again dualism or pluralism in the divinity. A third question arises from the fact that people used to associate both good and evil with the divinity. There is finally a dichotomy not directly related to the above issues but crucial to the understanding of the nature of the divinity and thus bearing indirectly on the above dilem- mas. It is the predicament concerning the relationship between the divinity and the ancestors. 2.1 Monism and Pluralism The same term for the divinity refers both to a single substance and to several of them. The verbal tenses and other grammatical variations in the language highlight this dilemma quite clearly. The people ques- tioned over this problem admitted it,- recognizing its enigmatic and paradoxical dimension. In the past, the most immediate idea that Adro recalled tended to be pluralist.15 The idea of the divinity that first came to mind and which people seemed to be most concerned about consisted of several Adro inhabiting earthly dwellings and characterized by an obvious anthro- pomorphism. Even when Adro was talked of as being one, the idea of pluralism was present in the belief that Adro had wives and children. On the other hand, monism did not easily and immediately emerge 472</page><page sequence="6">Divinity among the Lugbara from the traditional terms associated with the divinity. Even at present, notwithstanding a clear and established concept of monism strengthened by Christianity and Islam, when the terms of the divinity are associated with traditional religion, it is not monism that tends to surface but rather pluralism. At the same time, people spoke also of Adro as being one and supreme. He was generally described as the creator of people. He knew every- thing and he provided for people. He was not dwelling in a specific place and he had no anthropoid features. Ideas about this supreme Adro were much more vague than those related to the plural Adro dwelling in specific places and having human features. J.B. Odama, referring to the spirit-world of mysterious powers, says that, 'This world belongs to the divinities and ancestors. The divinities are categorized as: The Highest Spirit (The Supreme Being); the lower spirits; and the ancestors.'6 Odama uses 'divinities' in the plural. The plural implies, according to him, other divinities besides the supreme one. Hence, the term 'divinities' comprises the highest spirit and many lower ones. The 'lower spirits' in the plural are 'other divine beings.' These beings have a 'caused existence' not an 'absolute' one. These divinities derive their power from the Supreme Being and they have no authority independently of the Supreme Being.17 This then should explain the nature of the lower divinities vis-a-vis that of the higher divinity. Odama's assertion summarizes what can be presently concluded on this issue. Today there is a clear perception of one supreme divinity, different from other spirits. At the same time, it is significant to note that Odama, borrowing from E.B. Idowu, uses 'divinities' in the plural, instead of the term 'spirits.'" The use of the plural 'divinities' is a clear echo of traditional thought and a better translation of the traditional terms than that of having used the word 'spirits.' However, the present differentiation between a high God and the lower spirits cannot be backdated to past thinking in traditional religion. At that time, the dilemma existed and it is admitted that also today it is difficult to solve as Odama confirms: 'Nobody knows what the exact relation between God and the lower spirits is."9 One could ask how people in the past managed this kind of contradiction on monism and pluralism related to the same entity. The answer seems to be in the fact that the people in the past did not use the two concepts of monism and pluralism simultaneously, but at different times and in different contexts thus avoiding the confrontation of opposites. The interviews with elders on this issue confirmed that the two concepts would be considered one at a time, avoiding to compare or to relate them among themselves. 473</page><page sequence="7">A.T. Dalfovo The nature of the monistic and pluralistic dimensions of the divinity in traditional religion remains vague. The two dimensions remain an unsolved dualism. As already mentioned, each dialect designated both dimensions using one single term which contained both a singular and a plural reference. It was only subsequent and recent developments in the use of terms that helped to diversify this underlying dichotomy reserving Adro for the one God and Adroa for the spirits, at least on the part of the population that pivots around the Catholic Church. 2.2 Immanence and Transcendence Middleton has underlined the immanence and transcendence of the divinity in the sense that the divinity is felt to be close to the human condition, inhabiting the earth and resembling human beings in their features and way of life. At the same time, the divinity is thought to be above human contingencies, remote and different from human beings. Middleton assigns the term Adro to the immanent aspect and Adroa to the transcendent one. God is one but having a dual dimension. 'Lugbara say that both aspects of God are of one God, but that they live in different places.'20 Scholars like E. Evans-Pritchard and Godfrey Lienhardt have subscribed to such immanent and transcendent dis- tinctions considering them as ultimately fused into the same reality.21 Odama confirms this quoting Middleton and Mbiti: 'God is both transcendent and immanent in relation to man. He is the Absolute, the Other, yet mysteriously, like the wind, is effectively near to man in his daily living, assisting him to continue with life.'22 As explained above for the monistic and pluralistic aspects, so also the immanent and transcendent aspects were expressed by a single word, namely that used in one's dialect. Middleton's assertion that immanence and transcendence are two dimensions referring to the same divinity does not seem to resonate with the traditional perception of these two aspects. In fact, when considering their nature, the immanent aspect appears to be extremely anthropoid and inadequately divine. It is clearly pluralistic coinciding in this with the pluralistic aspect described in the previous section. But if in that previous case it was found nec- essary to provide two different names to differentiate between monism and pluralism, also here two names should have been found to differentiate between immanence and transcendence. If the pluralistic and monistic aspects of the divinity suggested the distinction between higher and lower divinities, the immanent and transcendent aspects could have sug- gested the distinction between what could be called a 'divine transcend- ence' and a 'human immanence.,' for example. 474</page><page sequence="8">Divinity among the Lugbara Instead immanence and transcendence were found reconcilable in the same divinity, particularly in the minds of foreign observers who were already initiated to this combination by the way in which divine immanence and transcendence were reconciled in Christian and Islamic religions. Hence, it was easier for such observers to see both aspects referring to the same divinity although, as mentioned, the foundations of immanence and transcendence in traditional religion differed. Imman- ence had more of a human than of a divine term of reference while transcendence had instead a proper divine reference. Hence, from the point of view of traditional religion, the two aspects could have been kept distinct and managed in the way monism and pluralism were, namely avoiding mutual confrontation. In his proposal to divide African ontology into five categories, Mbiti gave the first three as follows: '(1) God as the ultimate explanation of the genesis and sustenance of both man and all things. (2) Spirits being made up of superhuman beings and the spirits of men who died a long time ago. (3) Man.'23 Adro in his transcendence fits into the first cate- gory but not in his immanence. To provide for the latter, one must either refer it to the second category or invent an additional category between the first and the second. Ascribing immanence to the second category would seem the most obvious choice, and it is the one sug- gested by the above considerations that envisage immanence as refer- ring to a different entity from that to which transcendence is referred. 2.3 Goodness and Evil As already said, the divinity in his immanent aspect was thought to inhabit specific places like certain rivers and trees. People passing close to such dwellings at an inappropriate time were struck by sickness. The divinity localized in these places was feared and generally considered bad. The divinity in his transcendent aspect instead was considered good. Such goodness was usually related to his gift of rain and to the fertility of humans, animals and fields. As it was the case with the dualisms mentioned in the previous sec- tions, also for that of goodness and badness the term used was the one of the relevant dialect. When trying to explain this kind of contra- diction, the most common answer was that some gods were good and others bad. The bad ones inhabited rivers, bushes, mountains and sim- ilar earthly dwellings in great number and they had anthropomorphic semblance. It was the same description that applied to the pluralistic and immanent aspects of the divinity. The good gods were not living with their evil counterparts and they did not resemble human beings. 475</page><page sequence="9">A.T. Daifovo They had indistinct and indefinable features and they resided in shady places and on soft grass somewhere. Their nature was never clearly defined and ideas concerning them were vague. The traditional plu- ralism of the divinity allowed this differentiation between good and bad gods with the addition that in this particular explanation also the good gods were described using the plural tense. A few other persons explained the dilemma of good and evil in the divinity saying that it was actu- ally the same divinity that was both good and bad as it happens with humans who can be good at times and bad at other times. The dilemma of good and evil related to the divinity finds an echo in the personal names of people. In a research into 132 personal names referring to traditional religion, 50 were found to be made up of the word Adro. In analyzing the significance of these 50 names, the vague, sometimes confused and puzzling idea and nature of Adro emerges. These names echo both fear and confidence, indifference and concern. The Adro in personal names is responsible for everything momentous, from birth (Adrotini, Born of Adro) to death (Adrobua, Graves of Adro); the good aspect is mentioned (Adrofeta, Gift of Adro) as well as the evil one (Adroaonzi, Adro of evil); confidence is manifested (Adroceni, Shepherded by Adro) and neglect is admitted (Adroyo, No Adro).24 Odama sums up saying that issues related to evil in the divinity and to the ensuing evil activity towards the living 'are but a few of the unsolved mysteries about these lower spirits.'25 As it happened with the already mentioned dualisms, the use of the same term Adro did not create problems in traditional thinking as the good and the bad aspects were not considered simultaneously. It was only when goodness and badness became the subject of the same con- siderations under the influence of imported religions unable to reconcile similar opposites that the issue arouse. And its solution developed along the lines indicated above, namely by assigning two different names to the two aspects. 2.4 God and the Ancestors Another perplexing dualism related to the nature of the divinity has emerged when considering the offerings and sacrifices made to the divinity. These rites are basically the same as those performed for the an- cestors and they seem to be actually addressed to the latter with the divin- ity remaining somewhat in the background. Observers of Lugbara religious life can easily see that offerings and sacrifices are generally for the ancestors. The question then is about the relationship of the ances- 476</page><page sequence="10">Divinity among the Lugbara tors to the divinity in these religious ceremonies as well as in other more general cases. In trying to explain this, many people are of the opinion that the offerings placed on the shrines of the ancestors are ultimately meant for the divinity of whom the ancestors are mediators. In discussing this idea of mediatorship, a certain Christian influence emerges by which the ancestors are considered to fulfil the role of the Christian saints. Another influence seems to derive from similar studies among other peoples especially in Africa. These studies are known to some learned informants who find them applicable to the Lugbara con- text. Concerning them, Holas for instance writes that, 'The role of the supreme being in liturgical matters is almost null as he benefits only exceptionally of a visible and direct cult. It must not however be for- gotten that he is always the ultimate even though discreet receiver of every prayer, of every offering hierarchically addressed to the family an- cestors or to one of the minor divinities acting (in the world).'26 Maconi is even more explicit in asserting that, except for tribes in New Guinea and Melanesia, all other illiterate peoples consider the ancestors as inter- mediaries between the supreme being and man.27 However, a closer consideration of Lugbara traditional religion indi- cates that the idea of ancestral mediators may not be as obvious as some persons maintain. Several elders clearly assert and explain that people making offerings or performing sacrifices to the ancestors have only the ancestors in their minds. In the above mentioned interview held at Usukui, it was reported that, 'Before sowing, people gathered and food was consumed. Before eating, some food was placed on the ancestral shrines. That food was shared by ancestors. If they had been alive they would have eaten it. Nothing particular was offered to Adro. Adro was remembered only 'with the thought.' In fact, while the ances- tors have substantive sacrifices, large gatherings and long ceremonies, also the divinity has his specific offerings which, however, are generally of a lesser grade than those to the ancestors. The offerings to the Adro are normally no more than a hen, usually chicks, or some food. They are placed at rivers or thrown into them by one person without a fol- lowing or a gathering to accompany the ceremony. The few examples of offerings to the Adro, like casting a hen or its feathers and similar offerings into a river, pertain to the immanent aspect of Adro inhabit- ing that river. Hence, the offerings are mainly to Adro in his anthro- pomorphic and pluralistic aspect. Middleton confirms that, 'Offerings are made to him (God) in his immanent aspect and not to him in his transcendent aspect.'28 Offerings to the transcendent aspect of God are difficult to trace, as 477</page><page sequence="11">A.T. Dalfovo also Middleton observes: 'In his transcendent aspect, he (God) cannot be contacted directly by oblation but only through the 'hearts' and 'mouths' of living men, assembled as a single lineage entity.'29 A confirmation of this is in a description of a sacrifice given by Middleton. The sacrifice appeared to be offered to Adro but Middleton points out that the reference to Adro was atypical. Adro had been improperly brought in by a person directly involved in the case that had prompted the sacrifice. That anomaly was confirmed by one of the elders who were attending the rite.30 This case is recalled by B.C. Ray who also highlights that the reference to the divinity was contrary to accepted practice.31 J.B. Odama remarks that, 'The Lugbari hardly think about offerings or sacrifices to God; except in very rare cases when a human sacrifice is offered to ask for rain. God is self sufficient. He has no need of human food and drink like the ancestors who continue to eat after their death. It is only to the lower spirits and ancestors who live closest to the human environment that sacrifices of food can be offered and eaten by them.'32 Hence, the mediatory relationship between the ancestors and the divinity is rather difficult to fit into the concepts just envisaged. The relationship between the two is further compounded when one considers some accounts from the people that retain the concept of Adro to be ultimately deriving from that of the ancestors. Recalling how an impor- tant a'bii (grandfather) may become on (ancestor), some people explain that the process continues and important ori may become Adro.33 'Adro are the souls of our ancestors,' some observe, while others add, 'On is Adro.' These assertions may be a matter of speculation. But they are worth considering as there are echoes of this idea in some literary records and in culture. McConnell writing in 1925, reflected something similar by referring to or as a deity: 'There are two deities: On, a gen- eral name of ancestral spirits, who kills people, brings diseases and other evils, and Adronga or Adroa or Adro, who is generally a benevolent god.'34 In 1925, Stigand, speaking of the Madi who have the same historical and cultural background as the Lugbara and a language which is almost mutually understandable, gave their name for God as 0o.35 Up to now, the Madi Okollo to the south of the Lugbara use oi when a Lugbara would prefer Adro. The oi in Lugbara traditional religion is the most important element and the highest manifestation of traditional religion. The term can actu- ally be used to indicate Lugbara traditional religion in general. The pos- sibility of a derivation of Adro from it is a further proof of the importance of oi and, at the same time, of the lesser importance of Adro. Later 478</page><page sequence="12">Divinity among the Lugbara developments and influences made Adro to gain preeminence, demot- ing the ori to mediating ministers of Adro. Presently there are no queries in placing the divinity above the ancestors, but one needs to appreci- ate that, in the context of traditional religion, that has not been so sim- ple and clear. Hence, from an historical point of view, the dilemma concerning the relationships between the divinity and the ancestors is still valid. 3. An Historical Answer: The Name 'Mungu' The first Christian evangelizers among the Lugbara were faced with the need for a word to render such an important reality for their mis- sion as that of God. In their search, they came up against the variety of terms and the dilemmas in meanings referred to above. Those early evangelizers by-passed that difficulty related to terms and meanings by adopting a new name for the divinity to which they could attach the precise meaning demanded by their teaching. The name they chose was Mungu, borrowed from the Kiswahili language.36 The name Mungu might have already been known among the Lugbara through earlier influences. For instance, Mungu has been used also by Muslims whose influence in Lugbaraland began towards the end of the last century, while Christian evangelizers started their activity around 1918. Moreover other travellers and traders had come into contact with the Lugbara, some of them from the coast of present Kenya and Tanzania, the land of Kiswahili. Hence, the word Mungu could have been introduced anew by the Christians or it could have been already present and known, and then simply adopted by them and extended to a wider use.37 The word Mungu has remained in common use among the Lugbara until about 1950, when a trend began in favour of a return to the original Lugbara terminology. Doubts about the wisdom of using a for- eign word to express the divinity arose very early among missionaries working with the Lugbara. Writing only seven years after the first mis- sionaries arrived in Lugbaraland, McConnell reported: 'A missionary told me that, in spite of their determined efforts to discredit Adronga, he had in his riper knowledge come to the conclusion that this God differed little from the Christian Jehovah.'38 I personally collected similar remarks in favour of a return to traditional terminology from elderly missionaries who had known and heard the early evangelizers as well.39 In that early period, however, the term Mungu was not generally queried as it appeared to convey an unambiguous idea of the divinity that avoided references to pluralism and anthropomorphism. Moreover the 479</page><page sequence="13">A.T. Dafovo new term did not seem to raise specific problems with the early converts. The return to the traditional terminology could only come about gradually. In fact the process of evangelization in effect for over 30 years had firmly fixed the name Mungu in the mind and conscience of the people. The gradual reintroduction of the traditional terms for the divinity has been significantly recorded in the written works published during the period of change. I considered about fifty of them spanning the entire period of the Christian presence among the Lugbara to find out that the writings relevant to the change of terminology were those published between 1956 and 1970 by the Christian Church and par- ticularly by the Catholic denomination. In fact the change from Mungu to traditional terminology has been spearheaded within the Catholic Church. The name Adro appeared for the first time in 1956 in Katekismu Madri Class Alo. This publication was the first in a series of four text books of religious knowledge for use in primary schools. The second book was published in 1957, the third in 1960 and the fourth in 1961, all of them having adopted the term Adro.40 In 1957, the revised edi- tion of the book Edri resu Kristo dri originally published in 1935, appeared with the name Adro that had replaced the original term Mungu.4 In 1964, a similar revision was done for the book Eyo Okuri pi Eyo Odirn be, the revised edition having substituted the old term Mungu with the new one Adro.42 The manner in which the change from Mungu to traditional termi- nology occurred was particularly significant in the hymnal Ongo Buku that has had several editions since its first appearance in the early 1960s. Initially, this book used only Mungu. Around 1965 the term Adro began to appear in some of the new songs. Later editions had Adro in almost all the songs and also in some of the prayers used officially in the Church. The edition of 1981 had adopted the name Adro throughout.43 Also the term Adroa appeared in some publications. Its first appear- ance was in a translation of Matthew's Gospel in 1960 and four years later in a similar translation of Mark's Gospel, both by A. Androa, a Lugbara whose dialect used Adroa for the name of the divinity.44 This term was again used by the same author in a collection of Lugbara customs mimeographed under the title Logbari Obi.45 Also R.G. Maphua, from the same area as A. Androa, gave Adroa as the translation of God in his mimeographed The Essentials of Logbari Language published in 1966.46 Ultimately it was Adro that came to be adopted for the divinity while Adroa was taken to mean the lesser spirits. Hence, the trail of a return to traditional names for the divinity first appeared in 1956 with the term Adro introduced in a textbook and sub- 480</page><page sequence="14">Divinit among the Lugbara sequently extended to other educational books. Later it was introduced in publications used in the Church, first in songs and finally in prayers used in the official services. By the end of the 1960s the term Adro became well established and practically supplanted Mungu. With the 1970s, Adro entered in all literature and specifically in all prayers includ- ing those of the Mass that are usually slow to change due to their the- ological link with tradition and faith.47 Adroa can however be still heard instead of Adro. In fact Adroa could have replaced Mungu. It did not succeed simply because of the geographical and historical circumstances affecting it, and not so much because of its intrinsic meaning. In the Church of Uganda or Anglican Communion, the change in favour of traditional names for the divinity has been much slower.48 In 1975 the Bible Society of Kampala published an ecumenical translation of Mark's Gospel in Lugbara in which the divinity was rendered by the term Adrou, this being the way in which Adro is written in Vurra County. Three years later, the same Society published ecumenically the entire New Testament using the term Adrou in it.49 In the religious assemblies of this denomination, the name for the divinity most often used is still rehova. Mungu is also used in conversations. Traditional ter- minology for the divinity has not yet been widely adopted by this denomination. The Muslim community has the Arabic word Allah for God, but it uses also Mungu which remains a popular term for everybody. The tra- ditional name for the divinity seems to be restricted by Moslems to traditional religion. The non-religious writings have followed the line of the Churches in their use of the terms for the divinity, with a general tendency of keeping a prudent step behind and letting the Churches have the lead in such a sensitive issue as that of the divinity's name. 4. The Development of Terms and Meanings To summarize, one may recall how the underlying dualisms related to monism and pluralism, to immanence and transcendence, to good and evil, to divine and ancestral veneration prompted the early evan- gelizers to adopt a new name for 'their' divinity and thus to bypass the dilemmas posed by these dualisms. Subsequently, a blend of influences from within Lugbara society and from outside fostered a development around the traditional terms and meanings that made possible the even- tual return to traditional terminology. The early challenge faced by Christianity and Islam to reconcile the oneness, the purity and the 481</page><page sequence="15">A.T. Dalfovo goodness of 'their' divinity with the enigmatic dualisms of the tradi- tional divinity gradually disappeared, allowing the term Adro to take over the meaning of Mungu and the term Adroa that of lesser spirits both good and bad. The development of the traditional meanings and terms related to the divinity moved along the line of differentiating contrasting concepts such as goodness and badness or monism and pluralism. The distinction between a divinity characterized by monism and goodness and other good and bad spirits encouraged the search and development of appro- priate terms to which the distinct meanings could be attached. The approach to that search was inspired by the vision of the divinity of the respective researcher. The scholars involved in that exercise belonged basically to either the anthropological or the religious persuasion. The first was represented by Middleton who detected a transcendent and an immanent aspect of God, naming the first Adroa and the second Adro. The second was represented by Ramponi, Crazzolara, and the authors of O'duko Moke(ri) who distinguished one God, whom they named Adro, from lesser spirits, whom they named Adroa. Middleton carried out most of his research in western Lugbaraland where Adro is the dialectal variation and concluded that Adro rendered God in his immanent aspect and Adroa in his transcendent aspect. The first idea that Adro conveys in its respective dialectal area according to traditional religion is indeed that of the divinity inhabiting earthly dwellings and being rather a nuisance. The people considered that earthly and anthropomorphic aspect of the divinity as closer to their life either for good or bad. It was thus logical that Adro should be immediately linked to the idea of immanence as Middleton perceived and recorded. When at a certain point it appeared necessary to emphasize the divinity's transcendent aspect that was remote, less thought of and vague, and to find a different term from that of one's own dialect, the natural solution appeared to be that of using the corresponding dialectal vari- ation to one's own term. Such dialectal variation would have been both similar to that used in one's area and thus apt to convey a meaning related to the divinity and it would have been different from the one ordinarily used and thus capable to convey a different aspect of the divinity, namely a 'distant' term applying to the 'remote' significance of transcendence. Hence, for Middleton the dialectal variation was Adro, which naturally conveyed immanence, and the distant variation was Adroa that conveniently designated transcendence. Ramponi collected data for his writing in Lodonga where the dialectal variation was Adroa and Adronga. He also spent some time in Arua where 482</page><page sequence="16">Divinity among the Lugbara the dialectal term was Adro. This author retained Adroa or Adronga to be the 'great one,' while Adro referred to an immanent and plural aspect of the divinity.50 In the conversations I had with Ramponi, he explained that his account of 1937 manifested the bewildering variations of the terms in question and of their meanings.5' The fact that those variations were dialectal had not yet been clearly perceived by him at that time. Moreover, there was in him a more or less conscious desire to find some 'natural' monotheism in traditional religion.52 At the same time, monotheism, though not so sharply focussed, was nevertheless present in traditional belief. It could have also been encouraged by exogenous influences like the one from the Muslim settlement of Emin Pasha's soldiers in Aringa County where Lodonga was. Consequently Ramponi found that the Adroa and Adronga of Lodonga reflected monotheism and transcendence, while the Adro of Arua he had previously come into contact with conveyed a pluralistic and immanent meaning. Crazzolara studied the Lugbara language and gathered his data for it mainly in Ayivu where the dialectal variation is Adro. He concluded that Adro (capital 'A') described God the Creator and that adro and adroa (small 'a') was a man-like spirit dwelling in rivers. Crazzolara wrote during the 1950s, when social and cultural interaction within Lugbaraland was fully operative, especially in and around Arua town, where the author was living and doing his research work. In his vocab- ulary, Crazzolara recorded also the dialectal variation of the distant Terego County, namely adroa, but he considered the Ayivu dialect as the one to which all others had or would have had to refer and perhaps eventually melt into, due to its geographically central position. In Crazzolara's time Adro (capital 'A') was already established as the one God and Creator. At the same time, the implicit traditional pluralism and anthropomorphism remained, and thus adro (small 'a') retained also these meanings which Crazzolara duly recorded. The distant Terego variation adroa, with its traditional meaning, was also added as by then it was fairly well known, especially around Arua. The book O'duko Moke(ri) represented the last stage in this series of developments. Two points contributed to the adoption of the terms and meanings employed in this book, namely Adro for the one God and Adroa for the lesser spirits. The first point was that the authors were mostly from the area where Adroa was the dialectal variation and thus Adroa conveyed to them immanence and pluralism. Consequently, the distant term for God's transcendence was for them Adro. The second point was that by the 1970s, when O'duko Moke(ri) was published, the Ayivu dialect had acquired the status foreseen by Crazzolara. At the 483</page><page sequence="17">A.T. Dalfovo same time monotheism had penetrated deep and clear in the minds of people and Adro could easily substitute Mungu. The term adroa coming from distant Terego could be conveniently vested with the significance of lesser spirits, some of them good and others bad or, according to the Christian vocabulary used in O'duko Moke(ri), some of them angels and others devils. Hence the present situation of terms and meanings is not the one that existed about a hundred years ago. The material terms are the same but the way in which their meanings are presently related to the terms differs. The present meanings existed, to a great extent, in tra- ditional religion but they were gradually disentangled and differentiated with the addition of some clarificatory ideas as well. The present significance of traditional terms can now fit into the above mentioned first two categories of African ontology as given by Mbiti: '(1) God, as the ultimate explanation of the genesis and sustenance of both man and all things. (2) Spirits, beings made up of superhuman beings and the spirits of men who died a long time ago.'53 A significant echo of what has emerged from the written sources referred to above is found in Lugbara oral literature and specifically in traditional songs. These songs offer an original insight of the way people perceive the divinity in the course of their history as songs are composed all the time and the best of them remain in the traditional repertoire. As new songs enter the repertoire, the oldest are gradually dropped. Accepted songs, however, tend to remain in use for a long time, namely for a generation or more. Hence songs represent an historical record of the most significant ideas and events. They are thus particularly apt to reflect the change and development that has affected, among the rest, the terms and meanings related to the divinity. Of the 769 songs I collected, 75 mentioned the divinity, some of them more than once. The name Adro appeared 64 times and Mungu 19 times. Adro was used both in the singular and in the plural reflecting in most cases its immanent aspect. Songs are generally for funerals and of the 64 songs referring to Adro, 42 mention explicitly death. In the words of these songs, Adro is said to be planning death and perpetuating it surreptitiously. He abducts people, killing them and digging their graves. He finishes off the population, slaughtering it systematically and turning the land barren as if he were tired of people. The remaining 22 songs in which Adro is mentioned associate him with various other afflictions. He knows about them and he wants them to happen. The identity of Adro that emerges from these songs is that of an executive of death, misfortune and misery. He is considered to be re- 484</page><page sequence="18">Divinity among the Lugbara sponsible for them and to be the author of them as well. Adro comes into such tragic situations, not as a way out of them but as a way in, namely as the cause of them. In these songs there are all the unsolved dilemmas of the past related to the divinity Nineteen songs refer to Mungu describing his behaviour in quite a different way from that of Adro. Mungu's action in the songs is closer to the image of the divinity conveyed by Christianity and Islam. In one or two cases Mungu acts as the Adro described in the previous songs but in most instances Mungu is considered as an inspiration to aban- don evil, a giver of peace, a witness to beauty and good, an object of desire and praise, the one knowing people and their life thoroughly, a term of reference for human behaviour and the one answering prayers. Hence Mungu reacts quite differently from Adro to the challenge of death and sufferings. The songs with Mungu testify to a differentiation in the interwoven meanings related to the divinity, resulting in a pattern of divine qualities that is more intelligible to the contemporary mind. 5. The Creator A significant instance of the development of terms and meanings related to the divinity is that of Adro the Creator. Ramponi, Crazzolara and Middleton as well as a sample of interviews quoted above speak of Adro as 'Ba o'bapiri, translated as 'the Creator of men.' This is used as an argument in favour of a monistic Adro and thus against the plu- rality of entities in him. With regard to this, one needs first of all to clarify the concept of creation as expressed by the word o'ba. The verb o'ba derives from the simpler verb 'ba meaning 'to set, to put, to place, to lay,' to which the prefix o has been added in order to express intensity, frequency and plurality of the action expressed by the original verb 'ba.54 In order to render the idea of creation, o'ba has been preferred to ede which means 'to make, to arrange' in relation to human activity. It was feared that the choice of ede would have dimmed the concept of creation in the latter's essential implication of 'deriving out of nothing.' But o'ba could actually be understood as 'putting something where before there was nothing,' in which case the problem arises with regard to the ultimate origin of that 'something put there where before there was nothing.' It is the problem of how far back in time the action of o'ba can be referred to. In other words, o'ba did not actually express the concept of creation out of nothing. But at this juncture one may even ask whether that concept of creation 'out of nothing' interested traditional thought. In 485</page><page sequence="19">A.T. Dafovo fact, there are several examples of the absence of such concept in history and cultures. For instance, the ancient Greek philosophers themselves, notwithstanding their vast and deep speculations, did not feel creation within the same problematic context as we do today. For them, not- being meant not being this or that, but nevertheless being something. It was the first line of the Bible 'At the beginning God created heaven and earth,' that equated not-being to nothing and postulated the presence of a Creator.55 Santandrea writes that the Manga or Mangaya of Southern Sudan call God Vecona, which means 'Creator,' the etymological derivation being ve 'the one that,' and cona from coa 'to create.' It is the only case of this kind among African languages known to the author. At the same time, Santandrea specifies, the Manga have a mythological story which seems to invalidate the idea of Vecona as 'Creator.' The story narrates that there is no Vecona or 'Creator.' It was the earth that 'created' man in the same way in which it has produced grass, trees and their fruits.56 From a written correspondence with Santandrea on this topic, I further gathered that the verb in question originally and usually means 'to mould' used in connection with clay by the potter. Extending this prob- lem about the concept of creation to other African languages and peo- ples that Santandrea knew, he concluded that actually no specific term for creation 'out of nothing' could be found. When I probed into the remote past of the Lugbara avoiding any reference to the concept of creation, the information given linked the origin of people to migrations. People were said to have been living in a certain place because of having come to it from elsewhere. Some of these stories contained mythical elements but creation never entered as an explanation. It was only when informants perceived that my questions seemed to be oriented to creation that they offered an answer related to it. Christians brought creation into their answers quite naturally. A few others, espe- cially elders, confessed their ignorance on this point explaining that their ancestors did not know about these things. Middleton has come across the story of God having created the first man and woman. He writes: 'Lugbara say that they are all of "one blood," which was made by God the creator of men. He created a man, Gborogboro ("the person coming from the sky") and a woman, Meme ("the person who came alone").'57 The same author later quotes one of his informants as saying, 'Adroa made us here on the earth, and he made all the animals. Did he not put Gborogboro and Meme (the first beings) in the world?'58 In a subsequent work Middleton confirms, 486</page><page sequence="20">Divinity among the Lugbara 'At the beginning of the world Adroa created a man and a woman, Gborogboro and Meme. They were placed on the earth at a place called Loloi to the north and outside the Lugbaraland of today.'59 Besides this narrative that relates of God as the creator of man and woman Middleton quotes another one in which creation is not con- sidered. In it, early men and women are seen as being in close relation- ship with God. 'At the beginning of the world men and God were in a direct relation, and men could move up and down from the sky. Some say they were linked by a rope, others by a bamboo tower, and I have once heard it said it was by a tall tree. This bridge between heaven and earth was broken and men fell down, scattering into their present distinct groups each with its different language; before that all men spoke the same language, said either to have been Lugbara or Kakwa.'60 Middleton is aware of these different versions by which sometimes man and woman is envisaged as having originated by a direct inter- vention of God, and at other times the existence of humans is just taken for granted. He says: 'Lugbara told me that in the beginning the Creator put a man and woman on the world.... On the other occa- sions Lugbara would tell me a different myth about the origin of the world; that there was a time that men and women could move to and from the sky....'61 The above stories reported by Middleton do not suffice to establish the concept of creation and of a creator in traditional religion. To begin with, the story of the first man and woman having been created by God, a story that I also heard and recorded, leaves some doubts as to its authenticity. The story echoes somewhat the one of Adam and Eve. It also resembles similar narrations found among other peoples. I discussed the story with several people. Very few upheld its originality. The vast majority thought the story inspired by biblical influences. Second, Middleton gives two different versions of the story and there is no conclusive argument for discarding one in favour of the other. But if one were to insist on a choice between the two, the version that tallies better with the general thinking of informants on this issue is the one that does not query the origin of man as such but that simply takes such origin for granted. Third, one needs to know the original Lugbara words used by the narrators of the stories where the English translation has 'to make' 'to create' and related terms. In some of the quotations, the verb 'to put' is used which is the exact translation of the original o'ba. 487</page><page sequence="21">A.T. Dalfovo I conclude with the straightforward answer I received from a group of about forty catechists who had gathered in Ombaci from surround- ing areas.62 To my question whether in old times people had the idea of Adro 'ba o'bapiri, i.e. God the Creator, their unanimous and precise answer was that the idea of an overall Adro Creator of all was a late introduction. 6. Methodological Remarks In concluding this article, three points bearing on methodology need to be clarified as they might not have emerged clearly enough from this study. The first concerns the designation of the field of research, namely Lugbara society in both its past and present conditions. The second point refers to the differentiation between the past and the pre- sent of this society and the possible transfer of meanings from that past into the present. The third point is about the clarification of present meanings and, contrary to the second point, their possible transfer into the past. 1. The designation of Lugbara society. The analysis of a specific society could be approached on the assumption of its cohesion and oneness. This seems to be particularly the case of Lugbara society, especially when it is described as past or traditional, and also as small and simple namely as devoid of the diversity and complexity of 'developed' soci- eties. Maquet, for instance, describes this type of society as 'global,' namely as self-sufficient, with its team-spirit and an identity clear also to outsiders. The author comments: 'The global society is an 'objective' concept in the sense that not only those who are a part of it, but also neighbours and outside observers recognize it as such.... Since the con- cept of a global society is independent of the individual criteria of each observer, it is a particularly useful category.'63 This vision of Lugbara society as being homogeneous namely as having, for instance, a uni- form language and a common mind such that terms and meanings are unquestionably shared by all its members is actually running counter to its outstanding heterogeneity. Some authors have realized that diver- sity, like Crazzolara who, recalling the early immigrations of Lugbara ancestry into their present territory, concludes: 'They were far from being "one" nation and, apparently, never felt themselves to be a united people: they hardly do so even now.'64 Hutton adds: 'The Lugbara think of themselves as one people of "one blood" but there is consider- able cultural and dialectical variation over the whole area, so that the Lugbara are sometimes more akin to their neighbours in other tribes 488</page><page sequence="22">Divinity among the Lugbara than to other Lugbara in more distinct parts of the region.'65 However the approach of most researchers has practically considered Lugbara society to be considerably homogeneous in both its past and present existence. The present socio-political setup and culture encourage observers to presume a social cohesion and internal oneness that is not historically and culturally supported. The repeated references in this article to the diversity of Lugbara dialects suggest a cultural diversification and a related need to set aside the assumptions about the simplicity and uniformity of this society in favour of a more realistic acceptance of its complexity and diversity that have to be extended also to the past. 2. The diffrentiation between past and present. Another possible assumption in the study of Lugbara society is the differentiation between its past and its present. The two periods seem to be considered as if they were distinguished by a kind of imaginary line beyond which there is 'their' time and within which there is 'our' time, 'theirs' and 'ours' referring to two different cultural outlooks. 'Their' time is static, free from exoge- nous influences and rich in values. Traditional religion belongs to that past, implying it is static and consequently it has to be studied and understood outside patterns of change. 'Our' time, instead, is changing, exposed to outside influences and poor in values. The present study has indicated that meanings change at any point in history without discriminating lines stopping or starting such change. The past in fact is any moment looked at retrospectively from the pre- sent, while the present is the continuous point of arrival of the past. A meaning belongs to its specific time in history and a proper knowl- edge of the relation between a meaning and its historical development prevents the said meaning to be improperly backdated or postdated. But if it is fallacious to imagine a dividing line between past and pre- sent, it is equally deceptive trying to import across that line 'their' mean- ings into 'our' time. The problem here is that, while meanings change, the words to which such meanings are attached, remain unchanged. Hence words can carry forward or backward in time meanings that are not related to them any more. This gives rise to the phenomenon, among others, of considering traditional religion in a timeless ethno- graphic present, as Ranger and Kimambo observe.66 Meanings need to be clarified, fixing their specific contours in order to use language for effective communication. But this should not overshadow that fact that the dynamic process of change in language and meaning continues. Hence meaning should not be frozen to the point of creating a dichotomy between such fixed meaning and the evolving language. 3. The clarification of present meanings. The third attitude in the analysis 489</page><page sequence="23">A.T. Dalfvo of society may result from the assumed easiness with which analysts move into the past with their mental categories, transferring their ideas and interests there. This may even appear unavoidable and philoso- phers themselves concede the 'egocentric predicament' by which there is no avoiding being at the centre of one's epistemological activity such that the process of knowing starts and ends in the knower. However, being the subject of knowledge does not prevent or dis- pense the knower from starting there where he belongs to, namely from present existence. This implies starting to clarify present meanings. It is the present meaning that serves the purpose of using the language as a vehicle of significant communications. The 'true' meaning of a word is not in its past but in its present. If it were not so, language would not be conveying 'true' meaning and it would thus lose its purpose. The transfer of meanings to the past may be needed for the purpose of further clarification and comparison. It may be actually necessary to probe into the history of meanings and to explore their future develop- ments as well. But all these past and future considerations demand that one establish one's present position from which to clarify, compare and explore. Consequently, as this study has exemplified, monotheism and poly- theism may be transferred to the past with their present significance. This distinction has actually characterized several approaches to the study of religions, with polytheism marking early anthropological studies and monotheism instead being prevalent today, as Mbiti's work, among the rest, testifies.67 Hence, in line with this scholarly trend, one may feel appropriate to consider Lugbara religion either from a monotheistic or a polytheistic perspective, while in fact neither of the two may reflect the genuine nature of that religion. That nature could be better per- ceived, for instance, by combining both perspectives as this study has indicated for these and other equally challenging dualisms. The change of meanings in the context of exogenous and endoge- nous influences offers past and present challenges with both positive and negative possibilities. Applying freely the known reference to the scribe's wisdom (Mt 13:52), the challenges are presumably best met by bringing out from one's heritage new things as well as old. Chinua Achebe was probably trying that when, faced with an inheritance that included the colonial experience, he concluded: 'Everything is grist to the mill of the artist.'68 490</page><page sequence="24">Divinity among the Lugbara NOTES 1.
