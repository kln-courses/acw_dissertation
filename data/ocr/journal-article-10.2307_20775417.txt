<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CRITICAL RECEPTION OF MILTON'S DE DOCTRINA CHRISTIANA By Francis E. Mineka Every schoolboy has read, or is supposed to have read, Macaulay's essay on Milton, which first appeared in the Edinburgh Review for August, 1825.1 Not every schoolboy, however, remembers the occasion of Macaulay's essay: the first publication earlier that year, by royal command, of the Latin text of the recently discovered De Doctrina Chris tiana, with a translation by the Rev. (later Bishop) Charles Sumner. And it is easy to see why few should remember the occasion of Macaulay's article, which was professedly a review of Milton's posthumous Treatise; for, in keeping with the practice of the Edinburgh critics, the young writer used the Treatise chiefly as an excuse for an independent treatment of the poet. After the first two pages there is but one reference to the Christian Doctrine. Macaulay's readers of 1825, however, were not likely to be unmindful of the occasion of his essay. The discovery of the manuscript of Milton's Treatise in 1823 in the State Papers Office had been widely heralded in England and America.2 Most of the periodicals which announced the discovery did so with enthusiasm and looked forward eagerly to the publication. Only the Monthly Magazine was cold: "It is theological and controversial, and conse quently of little interest or value; if printed, it could only add to the lumber of polemical writings of his bewildered iXLII, 304-46. 2Some of the preliminary notices had appeared in Literary Gazette, (Feb. 21, 1824), 121-22; Monthly Magazine, LVII (1824), 69; Retro spective Review, IX (1824), 121-2; United States Literary Gazette, I (April 15, 1824), 31, and II (Aug. 1, 1825), 355; Methodist Magazine, XLVIII (1825), 558; London Christian Instructor, VII (1824), 614; New England Farmer, II (May 15, 1824), 340, and III (Aug. 21, 1824), 31; Monthly Repository, XIX (1824), 124, 253, 638; Gentleman's Magazine, XCIV (1824), 165.</page><page sequence="2">116 Studies in English times."3 The matter of publication was made the subject of a question in the House of Commons, and Peel's reply, quoting his Majesty's first observation that "A work of Milton's must be made public," was greeted "with loud and continued cheers."4 Few, if any, seem to have foreseen the shock to English religious sensibilities which publication of the Treatise was to cause; previously there had been little suspicion of grave heterodoxy in Milton's theology. "Some have inclined to believe," said Bishop Newton in 1749, "that Milton was an Arian; but there are more express passages in his work to overthrow this opinion than any there are to confirm it."5 Dr. Johnson, suspicious of Milton though he usually was, conceded that the poet appeared "to have been un tainted by any heretical peculiarity of opinion."6 The Rev. H. J. Todd, editor and biographer of the poet, reiterated: "From any heretical peculiarity of opinion he was free."7 The Rev. Charles Symmons, another biographer, agreed: "His theological opinions, ... as far as it appears, were orthodox, and consistent with the creed of the Church of England."8 Anglicans and Dissenters alike paid homage to Milton as the great religious poet of England. The Dis senters especially held him in regard as one of themselves; both orthodox and unorthodox Dissent derived comfort and support from his defense of toleration and religious liberty. His epic was frequently held as "second in importance only 3LVII (1824), 69. 4Quoted in Monthly Repository, XIX (1824), 253, from the Morning Chronicle report of the House of Commons proceedings, Mar. 29, 1824. 5Quoted by H.

Evidence of this reac tion has hitherto not been considered. That it was marked is demonstrated by the large number of reviews and dis cussions of the Treatise in secular and religious periodicals, both English and American, representing numerous dif ferent shades of religious and political opinion.12 A study of these reviews reveals: (1) the continued blindness of most critics and readers, even into the nine teenth century, with regard to Milton's heterodoxy in Para dise Lost; (2) the strength of his reputation, which could 9R.

A majority of these have not hitherto been listed in Milton bibliographies. This is probably not an exhaustive list, though it undoubtedly includes the most important and representative items. One article which it has not been possible to consult, because of war-time conditions, is a review by the young Frederick Denison Maurice in the little-known Metropolitan Quarterly Magazine for November, 1825.

The result is an interesting commentary not only on Milton's reputation at a crucial point but also on early nineteenth-century Protestantism itself. The reaction of the religious magazines merits first at tention, since the Treatise was a theological rather than a literary document; and since the Dissenters in particular regarded Milton as their own, it may be well to consider their publications at the outset. ORTHODOX DISSENT Throughout the first quarter of the nineteenth century the Evangelical and the Methodist magazines commanded perhaps the largest circulations among monthly periodicals in England.14 Both magazines regarded themselves as in struments of conversion among the unregenerate at home, and strenuously supported the efforts of mission societies abroad. Of the two, the Evangelical devoted much more at tention to the Christian Doctrine. In its first article on the 13Larson has pointed out that the heresy in the Christian Doctrine is such that, if it had been published in 1648, Milton could have been convicted on fourteen counts?five involving the death penalty, and nine life-imprisonment ("Milton and Servetus," PMLA, XLI [1926], 891-934). 14Though differing in basic theology, the two magazines were sim ilar in content and general make-up. Southey in 1808 called the Evangelical "a powerful engine,?the most powerful in this country" (J. W. Warter, Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey, London, 1856, I, 112). Founded in 1793 by the Rev. John Eyre, originally as a joint venture of Church of England and Dissenting ministers, but later of Dissenting only, it was generally Calvinistic in theology; it regarded itself as, in part at least, the successor of Toplady's Gospel Magazine. In 1820 its circulation was upwards of 20,000. The Methodist Magazine (originally the Arminian) was founded in 1778 by John Wesley as an "antidote" to the Calvinistic Gospel and Spiritual magazines. Its circulation was in the neighborhood of 25,000 by 1825. For a survey of these and other English religious period icals, see the introduction to the present writer's forthcoming volume The Dissidence of Dissent (University of North Carolina Press).</page><page sequence="5">The Reception of Milton's "De Doctrina" 119 subject,15 the magazine opened its discussion with a compli ment to Sumner for the candor and fairness of his preface and notes, since "Although a clergyman of the National Church, and high in Ecclesiastical and Royal Favour, he has ventured to speak of the Protectorate in terms of con siderable respect."16 Regretfully, the reviewer concedes the authenticity of the production.17 It is only "too lamentably evident" that towards the close of his life, Milton was, on many points, "wretchedly erroneous and unscriptural." Enumerating the chief heretical views, the reviewer mourns: It is, indeed, harrowing to the feelings to learn, from Milton's own showing, that he believed the Son of God to be nothing more than an exalted creature;?that he held the materiality and death of the human soul;?that he denied the doctrine of justification by faith alone, without works;?that he maintained, in unqualified terms, the total abrogation of the Decalogue;?that he resolved the institution of the Christian Sabbath into a mere matter of expediency;?that he pleaded for the lawfulness of polygamy;?and that he professed his belief that the Deity is possessed of some palpable form, and is agitated by passions similar to those which are common to the human bosom.18 The reviewer cannot resist a thrust at the Baptists, who might be (and were) rejoicing to find Milton on their side with regard to their most characteristic doctrine: the Bap tists' triumph must be moderated by the fact that Milton's "extreme heterodoxy in other particulars must forever annihilate him as a theological authority." If Baptists will boast, they must not forget that he was "an Arian, a Polyga mist, a Materialist, a Humanitarian, and, in fact, an abettor of almost every error which has infested the Church of God."19 "N. S. Ill (1825), 506-7. Ibid., N.S.

Arian and Humanitarian are, of course, contradictory terms.</page><page sequence="6">120 Studies in English And then the reviewer strikes the note frequently to be heard in the orthodox dissenting periodicals: How little, alas! can mere genius effect in protecting the human mind from the influence of pernicious error. . . ! How affecting it is to see the most stupendous intellects falling victims to the sorcery of an ingenious though deceitful theory, while the unlettered peasant holds on in the even tenour of his way, believing what God has said, and obeying what he has commanded!20 This thought consoles the critic so much that he is no longer moved to regret the publication of the long-hidden Treatise; after all, it is of some advantage to know what men of great powers can say in favor of dangerous opinions. "If such men as Milton can be confuted, nothing, or but little, is to be apprehended from inferior quarters." In conclusion, after promising a series of articles to confute the "most unscriptural parts" of the Treatise, the writer concedes that it does have "some decided claims on the lovers of biblical knowledge": notably, Milton's appeal and deference to the Scriptures throughout, "even where the reasoning is perverse"; and certain "passages of tran scendent energy and pathos, which would bear comparison with the very richest of his other compositions." The re viewer's final reactions, however, are those of "bitter sor row and regret.?Would that Milton had felt more humbly, and then, doubtless, would he have thought and written more correctly!" The Evangelical's promised series of articles to confute Milton's heresies began to appear in January of the follow ing year, 1826. A total of six were published.21 The series was evidently intended to be anonymous, but the inad vertent addition of initials ("J. P.

John Pye Smith, prom inent Dissenting scholar and controversialist, and a fre quent contributor to the Evangelical and other orthodox periodicals. Smith was a leading critic and opponent of Unitarianism and Arianism, and his treatment of Milton's views of the Son is therefore of especial interest. "The Doctrine Concerning Christ and the Holy Spirit" in its opening paragraphs repeats the burden of the pre liminary essay already outlined: Reverence great men as we must, they also are subject to error. Indeed, one might have expected even greater errors, for, since Milton was a poet, the highly imaginative quality of his mind was probably incapable of "patient and laborious investigation" and would "fly to a conclusion." After all, do not Milton's prose writings "affect us more by their intuitive truth, or their single overpowering majesty, than by the soundness of the argumentation that has professedly produced them"? Furthermore, some excuses may be made for Milton: the excesses of the Presbyterians after the Civil War no doubt repelled his mind from their religious system. "His gen erous sympathy with the oppressed, would dispose him to the most favourable feelings for the Socinians of Poland and the Remonstrants of Holland," especially when their views of religious liberty better agreed with his than did those of the Presbyterians. Such sympathies undoubtedly influenced his views, just as conjugal infelicity must have warped his opinions on divorce. Smith admits, "with grief," that Milton's doctrine con cerning the person of Christ and the Holy Spirit is Arian ism. Milton teaches that Christ is an inferior god, a god relatively, produced by the will and power of the Father of his own substance, before all other created things . . .; that his nature is, indeed, divine, but distinct from, and clearly inferior to the nature of the Father. . . ,23 22"A signature was added to the last, without the knowledge and contrary to the wishes of the writer" (ibid., N.S.

IV, 51.</page><page sequence="8">122 Studies in English In essence this is declared to be the Arianism of the fourth and fifth centuries, which was adopted by many Protestants in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and which toward the end of the latter century was largely merged with Unitarianism. "Milton's Arianism, however, was high above the lower parts of the slippery steep . . . ," i.e., Uni tarianism, which maintained the simple humanity of Christ. As specific antidotes to Milton's heretical views on this point, Smith recommends the writings of such divines as Waterland, Wynperse, Simpson (of Macclesfield), Hunt ingford, Wardlaw, and Grimfield; modestly, he leaves it for other reviewers to recommend his own popular defense of Trinitarianism,24 and concludes with a concise refuta tion of Arianism. The second essay, "Anthropomorphism," attacks the poet's opinions on the properties and affections of the Deity, and rejects Milton's tendency to attach literal meanings to terms used only figuratively in the Bible: for example, Milton's statement, "If 'it repented Jehovah that he had made man,' ... let us believe that it did repent him. . . ,"25 The critic believes that such reasoning reveals "a striking example of the power of poetical feeling, overbalancing the dictates of a cool and rigorous judgment."26 Even in so great a writer as Milton, "Conclusions so contrary to every dictate of reason, and to the whole scheme of revela tion, cannot be tolerated. . . ,"27 The errors of Milton concerning this topic, as well as concerning the nature of Christ, "may not improbably be traced to the influence of the Polish Socinian writers,"28 though man's fallen nature is so liable to error that no such explanation is needed. 2iThe Scripture Testimony to the Messiah . . . , 2 vols., London, 1818-21. 25The passage in question appears in The Works of John Milton, gen. ed.

IV, 94.</page><page sequence="9">The Reception of Milton's "De Doctrina" 123 In discussing Milton on the abrogation of the Mosaic Law,29 Smith classes the poet with the many distinguished Protestant divines, including Melanchthon and Luther, who maintained that this abrogation included the whole body of precepts enjoined upon the Israelites by Moses, and not merely their political constitution and their ceremonial rites, as most English and Scottish theologians held. But though Milton considered the whole Mosaic Law abolished, the Calvinistic critic defends him from any charge of being infected with "the coarse and licentious Antino mianism of modern times," for "he admits not the smallest relaxation of the obligations and the motives of religious obedience."30 Smith heartily approves Milton's exposition of the principles and precepts of Evangelical obedience, excepting only his views on marriage, the sabbath, and a few ethical questions. These exceptions are treated in the three remaining essays. In "The Sabbath and the Lord's Day"31 Smith is compelled to admit that the poet was in good company, that of Luther and Calvin, in maintaining that under the gospel, since the abrogation of the Mosaic Law, "no par ticular day is appointed by Divine authority to be kept holy above other days." Milton and others agree in the expediency of observing a stated day, but Smith is not con tent with this. He proceeds to summon arguments from analogy, from the example of the Israelites, the heathen, and the Christian apostles, and from ecclesiastical history, to justify the close observance of the Sabbath. In the essay "On Marriage, Polygamy, and Divorce,"32 the writer approves Milton's definition of the ends of the institution of marriage, but deplores his "most lamentable errors," which furnish a further example of Milton's "ex treme susceptibility of bias from collateral influences." No doubt the poet sincerely believed the grounds of his "Ibid., N. S. IV, 137-40. *?Ibid., N. S. IV, 137. ^Ibid., N. S. IV, 371-5. Ibid., N. S.

"It appears impos sible to doubt, however, that Milton's conjugal infelicity was the radical cause of his deviation, in this respect, from the general opinion of Christians."33 Minds of high poetical enthusiasm can scarcely be expected to discover the causes of their own prejudices. Smith then proceeds solemnly to demolish polygamy and divorce. The final essay, "On Veracity and Falsehood,"34 once more pays tribute to Milton's high and exquisite genius, but attributes his errors to that very genius. Throughout the Treatise, "we are delightfully carried on by evangelical doctrines," but ever and anon "dark blots and defacements break upon us." One of these sad obliquities is Milton's opinion concerning the obligation of Veracity. But Smith confesses amazement that Milton's errors of opinion seem to have had so little influence on his practice or his character. The poet manifested no inclination to commit polygamy, he forgave his recreant wife, his chastity of life defied calumny, and in spite of his bad theories with regard to veracity he "maintained the loftiest integrity in circumstances of peculiar trial and temptation." In conclusion, Smith indulges himself in another parting shot at the exultant Baptists: though Milton shared their views on baptism, he did not abjure his own infant sprinkling and submit to immersion! In contrast with the Evangelical, the Methodist Maga zine paid little attention to Milton's Treatise; while it noted the discovery of the manuscript,35 it offered no review. It did, however, notice and comment on Bishop Burgess's attack upon the authenticity of the manuscript and his defense of Milton's orthodoxy.36 The Methodist remarks that Milton's Treatise *Hbid.y N.

The Author of Paradise Lost had always been regarded as an orthodox believer, and those who cherished his memory were distressed to be informed that he was the secret advocate of principles subversive of the Christian faith.37 The reviewer approves the Bishop's assault, for if the Treatise is really Milton's, "it seems impossible to vindicate him from the charge of base and unprincipled dissimu lation." Despite the fears of the Evangelical that the Baptists would rejoice unduly in Milton's support of their most characteristic doctrine, their enthusiasm, at least as ex pressed in their periodicals, was temperate. The Baptist Magazine first noticed the work by simply extracting the poet's views respecting Baptism and Communion ;38 the New Baptist Magazine headed its page of extracts on baptism with the exclamation: "Milton a decided anti-paedobap tist!"39 The New Baptist made no attempt to analyze or review the Treatise. The Baptist returned to the publication with three ar ticles in the ensuing months (October-December, 1825) under the heading "Miltonia." The first40 recounts the dis covery of the manuscript, and announces that, since the size and price of the work (large quarto, ?2 10s.) may prevent many from reading it, the editors will furnish an analysis of the contents and print extracts concerning some of the most important points.

His views respecting the Son and the Holy Spirit are passed over in "silent regret," since they are "deeply tinged with Arianism." Also regrettable is Milton's support of materialism. Milton is said to be generally Calvinistic, however, on the mediatorial work of Christ, on calling, repentance, faith, justification, and adop tion, "excepting as regards the extent of redemption." In Essay III42 the writer, noting with satisfaction that Milton's views on Church Government "coincided with those of the earlier Congregationalists, both Baptists and Independ ents," anticipates wide approval for Milton's theories of "religious liberty, and the difference between civil and ecclesiastical power." The conclusion of the Essay re iterates the vanity-of-human-genius refrain noted earlier in the Evangelical.** Among the orthodox magazines, the most scornful review of the Treatise appeared in the Congregational Magazine.** A preliminary short notice which had previously appeared in the August number45 was evidently by a different writer or had been composed in advance of a thorough reading. It compared the appearance of a new work of the poet's to "the discovery of a new planet in the heavens," and said: It has long been the fashion in certain circles [of the Established Church, no doubt] to cry down Milton's prose works as unworthy of ^Ibid., XVII, 510-3. 4S"Let the wanderings of this great man shew us the folly of appealing to names and authorities in matters of religion, and remind us of the importance of that docility and humbleness of mind, without which we must not expect to attain sound scriptural knowl edge, and which, when joined with earnest prayer for divine illumina tion, will often give the 'wayfaring man' a decided superiority to the lettered sage" (ibid., XVII, 513). 44VIII (1825), 588-92.

The volume before us, published under the highest auspices in the land, may tend to correct this party prejudice, while it recommends that theology, and that moral practice flowing out of it, which have alike been too much discarded by the enemies of Milton's prose. . . . Milton's plea for polygamy is treated facetiously, "as a little bit of revenge on the fair, for ill usage." Monogamy is too firmly established to be unsettled "even by the genius of Milton, and a modern wife's cortege will not admit the expenses of a rival." The writer of the review in the November issue, however, is not only disappointed but deeply indignant: After two years of exemplary patience, during which our imagina tions were allowed to feed and work upon the promise of a forth coming treatise, upon so vast and sublime a theme, from "our great poet," what have we? Literally, a bundle of as dry bones as ever critic sat down to pick.46 If it were not for the occasional vigor of style and the as surance that the Treatise is genuine, one might imagine it the product of the "old Dutch and German Professors, with their gross bodies of divinity and unsightly specimens of theological anatomy." The book is "an absolute and total baulk." It "cannot be read; and, if it could, would do nobody any good." It is even dangerous, for it contains enough heresy "to delight all the Socinians, Arians, and other triflers with sacred Scripture, in both hemispheres," and it will confuse the undecided. Indeed, ... as a treatise on Christianity, the volume is utterly worthless, being a laborious attempt to explain what it confuses, and improve what it mars; and, after rising from the toil of perusing its pages, we could not refrain from exclaiming, in the hackneyed lines of Cowper, "O, how unlike the complex works of man, Heaven's easy, artless, unencumbered plan!"47 The Treatise can have no importance save possibly as Milton's confession of faith and "as an exponent of cer *eibid., VIII, 588. 47Jc?em.</page><page sequence="14">128 Studies in English tain ambiguities in Paradise Lost," which might better have remained ambiguities. The reviewer is melancholy to see such great labor, learning, and skill "worse than thrown away." Milton's views are said to be most closely akin to those of the Arian Baptists, though he is not a Socinian. No attempt is made to refute Milton's Arianism, but the reader is referred to the Rev. J. P. Smith's Scripture Testimony to the Messiah. It is conceded that the execution of many parts of the Treatise is "able, and not unworthy of Milton's pen; though, as a whole, we cannot but pronounce the work a production of his dotage," and vastly inferior to many other systems of Christian doctrine. "The sooner it is dismissed to its slumbers, from which it has thus late been disturbed, the better." The reviewer is more kindly in paying tribute to the excellence of Sumner's editing, his temperance, and his candor. That the Christian Doctrine did not perma nently affect the CongregationaVs admiration for Milton may be seen in the long review of Todd's revised Life of Milton early in 1827.48 Contrasting markedly with this contemptuous treatment in the Congregational, the long discussion of the Treatise in the Eclectic Review49 is temperate and reasoned. The Ec lectic, founded in 1805, was supported by the orthodox Cal vinistic Dissenters; in form it resembled the Edinburgh, and its reviews were ordinarily much sounder in scholarship and somewhat freer from prejudice than most that appeared in the sectarian periodicals. The reviewer admits his sharing in the almost universal disappointment with the Treatise, disappointment which he says should have been expected because of Milton's pre viously known views. The work does not, however, lower the poet's character or tarnish his fame; on the contrary, "In some respects, it does the highest honour to his intel lect and to his heart. . . ."50 His system is described as 48N.

Both as theologian and poet he stands alone. "Too heterodox for the orthodox, he is by far too orthodox for the sceptical and misbelieving school." Milton must be ranked "within the pale of the true Church," but therein "he dwells apart, an intellectual hermit, a sect consisting of the individual," though he is by no means in spirit a sectarian.52 The major emphasis of the Eclectic's review is placed upon the poet's Arianism, regarded as the only feature of the Treatise which might seriously mislead the faithful. The reviewer admits that the Arian views in Paradise Lost should have been clearly evident; that they had not been evident he believes may be accounted for by the "poetical necessities of almost anthropomorphous representation of the Eternal Father."53 Milton was clearly, however, no sceptic or free-thinker, as is demonstrated by his uniform deference to the Scriptures as the final law of faith. Even in his attacks on the authority of the Church, Milton at least thought he was attacking only human interpretations. As a divine, he is contrasted, to his great advantage, with his orthodox contemporary, Dr. William Ames,54 even though his mind was poetical rather than philosophical. The remaining departures of Milton from orthodoxy are treated briefly; his views of the creation of matter are said to be "singularly puerile";55 his materialism dangerous;56 his anti-Sabbatarianism like Paley's;57 his reasonings on polygamy and divorce "shallow and perverted" and tend ing to immorality (though "From the slightest relaxation of the moral discipline of the country, Milton would have silbid., N.

Milton's opinions are of historical interest, and there is little reason to fear that the work will make error more attractive. It illustrates the poet's piety and integrity if not his splendid intellect. In part his failure must be excused by the confused condition of his times and the shortcomings of his judgment, which now and again was overcome by "his learning, his fancy, and his prejudices." But the warp was merely in his judgment; and much as we have found to blame and to deplore in going through his Treatise?the very caput mortuum of Paradise Lost?we still retain entire our ad miration of his Muse, his greater self, and our conviction that he deserved, far more than most of his contemporaries, the high names of patriot, sage, and saint.60 UNORTHODOX DISSENT If the orthodox sectarian journals could still refer to Milton as "patriot, sage, and saint," in spite of his now undeniable heresy on fundamental points, it is scarcely a matter for surprise that the unorthodox sects should have been even more ready to pay tribute. Of the unorthodox dissenters, probably the most important, in influence if not in numbers, were the Unitarians, who in a sense may be considered the inheritors of the Arian movement of the eighteenth century. Since the Unitarians believed in the simple humanity of Christ, they could derive no direct com fort from Milton's Arianism, which held Christ to be divine though inferior to the Father; but Milton's attack upon orthodox Trinitarianism made the Unitarians regard him as a valuable ally. His name was one of the three standing toasts of the Non-Con Club, in whose membership Uni **Ibid., N. S. XXV, 135. **Ibid., N. S. XXV, 136-9. *&lt;&gt;Ibid., N. S.

The editor reveals his admiration for Milton in his re fusal to attack those of the poet's doctrines which were not held by Unitarians. It is conceded that "Milton's doc trine is entirely Arian," though "not the highest Arian ism."66 His exposure of "the absurdity of the conceit of eternal generation" and his refutation of "the commonly received doctrine of the Son being one in essence with the Father" are noted with approval, as is also the fact that "Milton gives the Unitarian sense of most of the texts alleged by Trinitarians."67 Such portions it is hoped the Unitarians may publish in cheap form for general circu lation.68 wEdward Taylor, "Some Unrecorded Passages in the Life of John Mjilton," Christian Reformer, N.

The work is a curiosity to be valued by posterity as a lasting memorial to Milton's independence and integrity of mind; "its influence will, we calculate, be seen in taking off the odium ecclesiastieum from what is called heresy."69 In addition to this review in three parts, the Repository printed two articles by the Rev. John Evans (a General Baptist minister who in 1804 had published an edition of Paradise Lost with a biographical sketch): "On Milton's New Work"70 and "Estimate of Milton's Theological Work, drawn from the Notice of Periodical Publications."71 Both of these articles take their departure from critiques of the Treatise which had appeared in other periodicals. Evans's first article attacks the reviews in the Evangeli cal and the Congregational. The taunt of the Evangelical to the Baptists is taken up; the triumph of the Particular Baptists may be moderated because of Milton's heterodoxy, but for the most part "the General Baptists [largely Arian] exult without reserve" in finding him among their ranks.72 Evans is not above a tu quoque in excusing Milton's more flagrant heresies of Polygamy and Materialism: an evan gelical clergyman, the Rev. Martin Madan, had advocated polygamy as a remedy for the evil of prostitution; Bishop Law and Archdeacon Blackburne, "the brightest ornaments of the Church of England," and even Luther himself, had maintained Materialism. As the best antidote to the bigotry of the Evangelical and the Congregational, Evans quotes the closing paragraphs of Milton's preface. The unique "Monthly Repository, XX, 750.

Of the monthly publications he claims that only two had done the volume justice?the Christian Moderator and the Monthly Repository. The quarterlies, the Edinburgh, the Quarterly, and the British Critic, had done better. Large excerpts are quoted from the last mentioned, with commendation for its moderate tone, "con sidering that Milton blows up the whole fabric of episco pacy." The article closes with a comparison of Milton and Dr. Priestley, the Unitarian leader.74 Of the remaining unorthodox publications, the Christian Reformer, a Unitarian monthly for the poor, published a series of ten articles by John Towill Rutt, consisting largely of extracts.75 The Christian Moderator, a short-lived (1826 28) Unitarian-Universalist miscellany, also endorsed the Treatise enthusiastically: Notwithstanding the intermixture of some curious theories and novel opinions, Milton was a very diligent, and, on the whole, a very suc cessful inquirer into the meaning of Sacred Scripture. The wonder is, not that he should have fallen into some mistakes, but how he was enabled to discover so much of the truth at the time when his countrymen were so blind to the light of unadulterated Christianity as he was to the sun! He looks, among his contemporaries, like one who had anticipated the progress of time by a century.76 Ibid., XX, 713. 74"Both were Unitarians of a peculiar description, both were reformers, protesting manfully against abuses in Church and State, and both, ill-requited by their ungrateful countrymen, withdrew from the turmoil of public life into the privacy of retirement, where, finishing some of their best works, they died in peace" (ibid., XXI, 731). 75X1 (1825), 236-42; 281-5; 317-9; 353-9; 386-90; 421-7; XII (1826), 29-33; 74-9; 123-7; 205-11. 76Quoted in the Monthly Repository, XXI (1826), 725.

There is this difference, however, from the Dissenting reviews: supporters of High Church doc trine and practice, like Dr. Johnson, despite their funda mental agreement with Dissenters on Milton's merits as the great English religious poet, had been ever wont to regard with suspicion Milton the prose writer, the sup porter of revolution, regicide, and disestablishment. Con sequently, the Established Church critics were not placed in so embarrassing a position in apologizing for Milton's errors in doctrine. Release even the greatest religious poet from the protection of the formularies of the Church, and this was the sort of error one might legitimately expect to find. Both the British Critic and the Quarterly Theological Review, which were eventually merged with one another, published long reviews of the Treatise; the tone of both criticisms is severe at times, but in general temperate and scholarly. The British Critic's reviewer77 rejoices, first of all, to discover that the poet's divinity "was very far from being of a fanatic, or puritanical cast,"78 and that his temper had been purged by age and religion. There is little in this Treatise "to remind us of the author's former ungovernable and savage vehemence."79 Milton's anthropomorphism is noted as a peculiarity of no great moment.80 Members of the Established Church, except for the high Calvinistic wing, would find little fault with the poet's views on the divine decrees, especially in relation to man's freedom of will, "though he has utterly failed in his effort to explain it."81 Churchman and Puritan alike must equally lament Milton's Arianism, which, "though lower than that of Clarke, "N.

Though of less importance, Milton's views on the creation of mat ter are also said to have dangerous tendencies.83 Milton's chapter on polygamy presents him "as a sort of ornitho rhynchus paradoxus in divinity. A hairy quadruped, raking in the mire with the bill of a duck, is a spectacle scarcely more strange and odd, than this solemn and austere re former, in search of materials for the vindication of legal ized concubinage. . . ,"84 The poet's sincerity of conviction is not questioned, however, either on polygamy or on divorce. The Critic regards as perhaps the weakest chapter that in which Milton maintains "that both soul and body are extinguished by death, and that both are to be raised again at the last day." His aberration of mind, on this point, "approaches almost to dotage,"85 Despite his veneration for the poet, the reviewer in closing confesses that, during some parts of his task, he felt very much as if he had been filling his belly "with the east wind." He does not question Milton's integrity of purpose, but believes that the poet's judgment was preju diced against the testimony of antiquity by his participation in controversies on church government. "Love of inde pendence has betrayed him into such extravagancies" that his theological work might just as well have re mained buried. It is valuable as a literary curiosity, because "it completes the work of a writer whose gi gantic powers have contributed to make the British name respected and honoured throughout the civilized world."86 Relics of his genius ought to be preserved with pious care.

The Quarterly Theological Review's criticism87 begins with a tribute to Milton as "among the proudest names of English literature," but also with a warning that reverence for his genius must not be allowed to "palliate error, or to sanction heterodoxy."88 Milton's moderation in the Trea tise, his piety, his motives, must be respected. Nor is the work itself altogether without merit: "Examples of elegant illustration, of close reasoning, of . . . brevity and cor rectness,?might be cited in abundance."89 Milton has stated clearly and defended ably, some of the most impor tant doctrines, such as those concerning the Atonement and the Divine Decrees. The reviewer rejoices that Milton does not endorse the Calvinistic doctrine of Reprobation.90 His notion of the rite of baptism is said to be degrading, but on the doctrines of Justification, Adoption, Assurance, and final Perseverance he is generally correct; here he would seem to be in agreement with the Established Church. Milton's Arianism, remarks the writer, has hitherto been suspected only by those few who have been "able to dispel the mists of poetic imagery spread before their eyes"; now it must be evident to all. Milton's views on this subject are scarcely worth reading: Through the whole of the discussion there is nothing characteristic of the cautious divine, but everywhere a precipitancy of judgment which cannot be too much condemned, and a flippancy of argument, evidently arising from a presumptuous confidence in human reason on matters on which human reason can never "search out to per fection."9! On divorce, Milton has added little or nothing to Selden's arguments. In supporting liberty of divorce and the law fulness of polygamy, he distorts Scripture to his own pur (1826), 42-65. 8*Ibid., Ill, 42-3.

Undoubtedly his judgment was affected by his feel ings and his prejudices. Milton's lax opinions on minis terial authority and ecclesiastical jurisdiction, his "Eras tian notions/' are attributed "to his having imbibed a portion of the malignant spirit of the age which subverted the altar and the throne."92 The reviewer quotes with approval Dr. Johnson, "who was as much superior to Milton in giant force of intellect, as he was below him in imaginative invention."93 Milton's biblical knowledge is neither extensive nor profound; it cannot be compared with that of many of his contemporaries, Anglican and noncon formist. There is little evidence of extensive learning in the Treatise. His use of strings of texts is injudicious. His disdain of all authority in religious matters has led him astray. The Treatise has rightly been published, though it "will not add to the author's reputation as a writer, a scholar, or a theologian." But Milton's fame is so great that, whatever the defects of this posthumous publication, they "cannot cast even a momentary shade over the bright ness of his renown."94 SECULAR PERIODICALS If, in spite of his heresies, the religious periodicals still felt obliged to pay tribute to Milton, it is scarcely to be wondered at that the secular reviews and magazines should do likewise. Although few of the reviews in the secular periodicals rose to the heights of panegyric seen in Macau lay's Edinburgh article, they were in general laudatory of the man and the poet. Like Macaulay, most of the critics regarded the publication as of little importance, except for its connection with Milton, though some pointed out its value as a guide to the understanding of Paradise Lost. The religious predilections of different critics and periodi cals may also be seen in the secular publications. Macaulay, it will be remembered, pays scant attention to the Christian Doctrine.

But enough of such discussion, says the young reviewer. "The book, were it far more orthodox or far more heretical than it is, would not much edify or corrupt the present generation. ... A few more days, and this Essay will follow the Defensio Populi to the dust and silence of the upper shelf. . . ."98 The present occasion, however, is a fitting time for commemorating "in all love and rev erence, the genius and virtues of John Milton, the poet, the statesman, the philosopher, the glory of English litera ture, the champion, and martyr of English liberty." And with this, Macaulay launches into his discussion of Milton's poetry. Unlike the review in the Edinburgh, that of the Quarterly Review" sticks fairly close to the immediate subject. De spite its High-Church, Tory editorial policy, the Quarterly here seems to have striven to master its prejudices. It grants the authenticity of the work, while noting that in the Treatise Milton's style is without either its peculiar faults or its peculiar beauties. On the score of doctrine, the reviewer anticipates "much serious apprehension from the pious and devout,"100 for, if the mind of Milton could arrive at such erroneous conclusions, what can be expected of humbler minds? The reviewer hastens to supply a key ^Edinburgh Review, XLII (1825), 304. 9?Ibid., XLII, 305. 97Idem. 98Idem. 99XXXII (1825), 442-57. ?Ibid., XXXII, 446.</page><page sequence="25">The Reception of Milton's "De Doctrina" 139 to Milton's peculiarities of opinion in order to elucidate principles and to counteract the danger. The key to under standing is revealed as the fact that Milton "measures man kind by his own standard." His "high, abstract, imagina tive Christianity ... is not that of the scripture, because it is totally unadapted to the mass of mankind."101 To join in no form of public worship, to reject the observance of the Sabbath, to acknowledge no authority in any public ministers of the Gospel, to permit divorce on grounds other than adultery, all these might be comparatively harmless in Milton's dream Utopia, but they are unthinkable in the actual world.102 Milton illustrates the danger that the imag ination, intent only upon the splendor of the ends which it envisions, may be too little careful of the means by which those ends are to be obtained. Hence Milton, in the bold and unprincipled usurpers of an authority more lawless and imperious than that which they had overthrown, in Bradshaw and Cromwell, beheld only the agents of Divine Provi dence to advance the establishment of his visionary republic Hence, the more awful delusion?a mind impregnated with the spirit of the Bible, like Milton's, became the fierce and willing advocate of a crime, deep as the murder of Charles, and trampled on the memory of that unfortunate monarch with savage triumph and unmanly exultation.103 Erroneous as the reviewer considers many of Milton's doctrines to be, he professes to feel no lowering of respect for the poet's character or any lessening of admiration for the depth and vigor of his intellect. The remainder of the review sketches rapidly the form of the Treatise and de velops briefly its more unusual opinions. Milton's views on anthropomorphism are generously quoted.104 On the Divine Decrees he is said to be at one with the modern English Church. Less attention than usual is paid to Mil ton's Arianism; it is labeled as approaching the highest wldem. 102TW0 years later in the Quarterly (XXXVI, 28-61), in his review of Todd's edition of Milton, Robert Southey further developed this theme: "Milton was too visionary to be followed" (XXXVI, 38). io3/6^., XXXII, 449. io4Joid., XXXII, 450-2,</page><page sequence="26">140 Studies in English form of that heresy but in such a way as to "afford no cause of triumph to the modern Socinian."105 The chief point of attack is Milton's dislike of established religion. In closing, the reviewer predicts little interest in the Treatise once curiosity has subsided. "Milton's theology, indeed, will be studied in Milton's poetry."106 Milton's prose works will be read only as illustrative of the poet's history and char acter. In his own sphere he shines, and will shine, alone and un approachable; and should the mother tongue . . . become extinct in the vicissitudes of ages; to Milton, more than to any but one, and that one Shakespeare, will our native speech owe its second life and future immortality; for their sake destined to become the perpetual and devotional study of all those whose minds expand under the influence, and whose hearts are touched by the spell of untranslateable poetry.107 The Monthly Review, the long-lived predecessor of the Edinburgh and the Quarterly, though possessed of a repu tation for hostility to the Establishment, did not go out of its way to puff Milton's unorthodox Treatise.108 For the most part its review simply analyzes and condenses the chief sections. It finds little that is new in the doctrines of the work. Milton's anti-Trinitarian arguments "contain nothing very striking;?the scriptural illustrations being trite, and the reasoning generally a wearisome repetition of scholastic distinctions. . . ."109 Milton's Arianism should have been obvious before this publication, "but the com mentators in general have not a hint on the subject."110 The reviewer professes himself to have been more acute. Mil ton's work shows his intense knowledge of the scriptures and a profound consideration of every question of theology, though it is criticized for scholastic quibbling, special plead ing, and dogmatism.

After all, he is a poet, not a theologian. "A great genius in poetry has only to express his feelings; but such an expression is utterly incompatible with history or philosophy."116 The generally unorthodox and "Jacobinical" Monthly Magazine gave only a paragraph to the Treatise,117 noting that the ladies might be "amused and instructed by his matrimonial divinity" and by his advocacy of polygamy. The New Monthly, the bitter rival of the Monthly, paid more attention.118 While it does not endorse all Milton's doctrines, the tone of the review is favorable.

This seems to have been the only periodical to approve Milton's views on divorce. Though regretting his views on polygamy, the reviewer says: At the hazard of giving offence by supporting an unpopular opinion, we hesitate not to say that we consider Milton's reasoning on the subject of divorce to be irrefragable; and the present laws respecting the indissolubility of marriage to be founded neither in Scripture nor common sense, but to be hostile both to these and to human happiness.119 Of the monthly periodicals, the Tory Blackwood's was most critical of Milton.120 The reviewer points out that the Treatise, the work of "the greatest of our poets," is, of course, a book which all critical readers of his poetry and all libraries must have, but otherwise it is of little im portance. From reading his Paradise Regained any careful critic should have suspected Milton's denial of the divinity of Christ: That Newton, and the general rabble of the commentators, suspected no such thing, will not seem wonderful to those who know their labours?for it is not too much to say, that more ignorance never was displayed in the commentaries on any work, than in those which we see gathered about the text of Paradise Lost?and Regained, like a tangle of filthy underwood round an oak.121 The critic finds it hard to acquit Milton of disingenuous ness in concealing his opinions, for the scheme of Paradise Lost is orthodox. His sins against orthodoxy in the great epic "are those of omission, not commission. . . . Para dise Regained is utterly ruined by his dissimulation in this point"?i.e., in suppressing any assertion of the divinity of Christ. It is fortunate, however, for the popularity of his poems that Milton was prudent enough to conceal his unwelcome opinions. The reviewer professes not to be surprised at Milton's advocating polygamy, for everywhere he "speaks of woman as a slave, not a companion, far less 11QIbid., XIV, 189. 120"Notebook of a Literary Idler," No. Ill, XVIII (1825), 587-9. 121Ibid., XVIII, 587.</page><page sequence="29">The Reception of Milton's "De Doctrinal' 143 as an equal of man," and in private life he attempted to carry his theories into practice.

No praise can be too great for his intellectual powers, but with that tribute his panegyric must conclude.122 The critic refuses to join with those who regard it as un fortunate that the Treatise should have been published; enough was known of Milton's opinions "to hinder us from being astonished at anything that he would assert. A col lection of opinions as generally revolting, could be made from his prose works already before the public." Nor could the poet's character lend weight to his opinions; . . no opinion, religious or political, of Milton's, is en titled to any more respect than what it would obtain from its own intrinsic merit."128 The article ends with an attack upon Arianism, and upon Arians within the pale of the Church. Of the magazines designed for popular circulation, the Quarterly Magazine, a new series of Knight's Quarterly, published the longest article on Milton's Treatise.124 The fact that Charles Knight, the publisher, was a friend of Sumner and the publisher of the Christian Doctrine may have had something to do with this.126 Certainly no other periodical hailed the publication more enthusiastically. The chief emphasis of the article is placed upon the value of the Treatise in clearing up obscurities in Paradise Lost. Singled out for comment and quotation are the doctrines which might have been unsuspected by readers of the poems. The reviewer notes the blindness of Newton, Todd, and Symmons with regard to Milton's Arianism, despite 2Ibid., XVIII, 588. 12*Idem. 1241 (1825), 1-26. 125Knight in his first series had published Macaulay's "A Con versation between Mr. Abraham Cowley and Mr. John Milton touch ing the Great Civil War," III (1824), 17-33.</page><page sequence="30">144 Studies in English the doubts of Colton and Joseph Warton as to the orthodoxy of certain passages. The reviewer believes Milton not to have been altogether disingenuous, for, knowing his own opinion to be adverse to that which has almost universally prevailed through Christendom, [he] was determined to adhere to the very language of Scripture, that so both he and his readers might be able to affix their meanings to his verses.126 This was fortunate for the repute of the poem. Knight's reviewer dismisses Milton's argument on polygamy as "an amusing piece of special pleading,"127 and declares that his anti-Sabbatarianism was only what might have been ex pected. In addition to reprinting extracts of Milton's views on tyrannicide,128 the article quotes several passages to show how the Treatise enforces and explains Paradise Lost. The reviewer concludes with a defense of the propriety of publishing such a heretical work: neither Milton's charac ter nor the vital tenets of Christianity will suffer. One learned periodical, the Classical Journal, published a scholarly and dispassionate review of the Treatise.129 Tribute is paid to Milton's Latinity and to the elaborate and minute correctness of Sumner's translation. Praising Milton's knowledge of the Bible as "probably never sur passed," the critic says: "In argument he is close, cautious, strongly opposed to vagueness and to scholastic intricacies, and keeping carefully in view the matter of dispute." But as a result of his unqualified submission to the authority of Scripture, his inferences are often too narrow, and "grounded on over-literal interpretation of the text."130 On all important points, however, Milton's doctrines are de clared, with one exception, to "coincide with the belief of the Christian church in general"?his opinions on such subjects as the Sabbath, divorce, and polygamy being re garded as not affecting the substance of Christianity.

In conclusion the Treatise is said to have interest "as exhibiting, in the form of simple opinion or unadorned statement, much of the matter which elsewhere presents itself to us invested with the splendors of poetry, or colored by the passions of time."181 In concluding this survey of the critical reception of the Christian Doctrine192 one finds it difficult to assess with finality the effect of the publication upon Milton's reputa tion.

Those that I have read do not materially alter the picture.

Channing's essay was frequently reprinted?in London, for instance, in 1826, twice in 1828, and in 1830?and was itself reviewed in a number of English periodicals: Edinburgh Review, L (1829), 125-44; Monthly Review, CXV (1829), 471-8; Edinburgh Review, LXIX (1839), 214-30; Eraser's Magazine, XVII (1838), 627-35.

Fitch, [review], The Christian Monthly Spectator, VIII (1826), 80-94; Christian Journal and Literary Register, X (1826), 36-7, and XI (1827), 45-54, 65-71, 105-6. 1330nly one bit of contemporary evidence?and that hearsay? has been uncovered: Henry Hallam in his Introduction to the Lit erature of Europe (New York, 1848), II, 373, remarks, "It is said that the discovery of Milton's Arianism, in this rigid generation, has already impaired the sale of Paradise Lost." Against this sug gestion may be placed the following. A computation based on</page><page sequence="32">146 Studies in English been before 1825 to heresy in Paradise Lost, the opening of their eyes did not lessen their admiration for the poet. This study of the reviews has shown that Milton's poetical reputation was so firmly established by the early nineteenth century that even published proof of deeply rooted heresies could not shake it. In an age increasingly less interested in theology per se, Milton's Treatise found, as Masson puts it, few "real readers," and it had no discernible effect on English theology.134 After creating a passing sensation, it retired to the upper shelves. Milton had gained in the process, however, as Emerson in the North American Review135 pointed out later, "some increase of permanent praise." It was very easy to remark an altered tone in the criticism when Milton re-appeared as an author, fifteen years ago, from any that had been bestowed on the same subject before. It implied merit indisputable and illustrious; yet so near to the modern mind as to be still alive and life-giving. . . . There is no name in literature between his age and ours, that rises into any approach to his own. And as a man's fame, of course, characterizes those who give it, as much as him who receives it, the new criticism indicated a change in the public taste, and a change which the poet himself might claim to have wrought.136 Stevens's and Fletcher's bibliographies shows that from 1800 to 1824 there were 32 editions and reprints of the collected Poetical Works and 37 of Paradise Lost; from 1826 to 1850, 45 editions and reprints of the collected Poetical Works and 37 of Paradise Lost. This would seem to show little difference in the periods before and after the publication of the Christian Doctrine, but without information con cerning the size of the editions, such statistics furnish no very reliable index to Milton's popularity. The increased use of stereotype plates in the latter period, however, would seem to argue that larger editions were published. 134Masson says: "Had it been published while Milton was alive, or shortly after his death, it would certainly have become notorious, and would probably have exerted very considerable influence on the course of English theological thought through the last two centuries, as well as on the traditional reputation of Milton himself" (The Life of John Milton, VI [London, 1880], 817). i^XLVII (1838), 56-73. ^Ibid., XLVII, 56-7.</page><page sequence="33">The Reception of Milton's "De Doctrina" 147 Finally, it may be said that the varying attitudes towards Milton's heretical Treatise which have been examined here reveal more than merely the respective denominational and theological prejudices of the religious periodicals of 1825; they reveal more even than the transcendent, enduring brightness of Milton's reputation, which clouds of political and religious prejudice could not eclipse. These criticisms reveal something of the genius, the nature, of a many-sided Protestantism which had developed to a point where it could sustain the shock of discovering that its greatest religious poet was infected with heresies, combat them by reason and argument rather than by suppression, and still pay high tribute to their author. If Milton had published his Treatise in his own lifetime, he would have been liable to extreme punishment and the work itself would probably have been suppressed. If he had been alive in 1825 to witness the reception of his views, he could not have liked it in all respects, but he would have rejoiced to see the principles of his Areopagitica being carried into practice in the multiplicity and diversity of English religious and secular periodicals.</page></plain_text>
