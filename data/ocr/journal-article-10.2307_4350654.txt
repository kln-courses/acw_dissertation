<plain_text><page sequence="1">W. H. Parker (ed., tr.). Priapea: Poems for a Phallic God. New York: Routledge/Croom Helm, 1988. Pp. 216, incl. 6 b/w plates. $27.00. ISBN 0-7099-4099-8. The Priapea have not been readily available to the general public, and Parker's edition is very welcome. The author surveys all the Greek and Latin epigrams dealing -with the mischievous and saucy god. The introduction is scholarly and thorough, dealing with the text history, extensive attempts at textual emendation, and authorship. The body of the book presents the collection itself-80 or so poems of varied meters and styles. Each is accompanied by a careful apparatus, parallels, English translation, and discussion. The translations of the shorter and simpler poems are generally successful, but those of the more stylish are often very awkward in rhythm. This is a book for anyone interested in the by-ways of Latin poetry-many could be used as appetizers in a high school Latin class.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 371 My one quibble is that the author confuses the herm-a specifically Athenian political icon invented in the late sixth century-with the later and more fully anthropomorphic Priapos. Four of the six illustrations are of herms, not Priapoi. Stanford University JOHN J. WINKLER CW 83.4 (1990)</page></plain_text>
