<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WAR OVER WORDS: Imagination as Casualty in the Greeneville Textbook Case Michael K. Smith and D. Edward Francisco Jn the swelter of July 1925, Clarence Darrow, self-appointed apostle of progress, and William Jennings Bryan, stalwart de- fender of literalist faith, squared off in the high-ceilinged, newly-lacquered courtroom of Dayton, Tennessee. It was in this setting, amid the arid intellectual topography of a region that would unabashedly relish the distinction of being called the buckle on the Bible Belt, that the fate of opposing image- ries was decided by an unmistakable margin of default. As students of history are quick to point out, science did not so much triumph as religion succeeded in losing of its own ac- cord, relying upon cliché, equivocal language, and shallow con- tradictory mythologies as its only defense in that famous trial between the State of Tennessee and John Thomas Scopes. Once more the State of Tennessee has gone to trial over reli- gion. Only this time, the State has switched sides, and the ge- ography has shifted from the hamlet of Dayton some 120 miles to the northeast, to the picturesque township of Greeneville (pop. 14,000). The date is 1986. At issue is the use of elemen- tary and secondary school "basal" readers, published by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston Company, comprising a significant por- Michael K.

The plaintiffs in the case, seven families from Greeneville and nearby Haw- kins County, maintain that the Holt texts, fifteen of which were labelled as exhibits in the most recent of a series of tedious courtroom proceedings, violated their children's religious free- dom by omitting "conservative Biblical Protestantism as a way of life." As Paul Vitz, Professor of Psychology at New York University and witness for the plaintiffs, observed, "Of six hundred items (stories, poems, and essays) examined in texts for grades one through eight, only one story represents the Christian world view at all, and that is a Roman Catholic story set in the exotic Old West that features devotion to the Virgin Mary." Other objections besides the omission of Protestant themes had been articulated publicly since 1983 by the primary spokes- person for the plaintiffs, thirty-four-year-old Vickie Frost, whose children, ages 15, 14, and 10, she argued, suffered re- peated violations of their religious beliefs. According to Frost, who received national publicity for her participation in what the media erroneously dubbed Scopes II and whose testimony figured predominantly in the decision for the plaintiffs handed down by the U.S. District Court in September of 1986, the Holt textbooks contain sixteen objectionable features: (1) Futuristic supernaturalism (2) One-world government (3) Situation ethics or values clarification (4) Humanistic moral absolutes (5) Pacifism (6) Rebellion against parents or self-authority (7) Role reversal (8) Role elimination (9) Animals equal to humans (10) Skeptic's view of religion (11) False views of death and related themes (12) Magic (13) Other religions (14) Evolution (15) Godless supernaturalism (16) Specific humanistic themes Not only did Frost claim that the existence of these features in the textbook constituted a violation of her children's religious</page><page sequence="3">The War Over Words 415 freedom, but she convinced Judge Thomas Hull that the books themselves actually "attack our Biblical beliefs." It would be a mistake to assume that Mrs. Frost resorted to casuistical gymnastics or that the letter of Judge Hull's law was meant to uphold archaic proposals that a more sophisticated understanding has long since abandoned. The Greeneville textbook controversy is not about the conflict between science and religion /œr se. Vickie Frost is not a Creationist of the stripe who travels the lecture circuit challenging the "theories" of scientists. She cited evolution as an objectionable concern only twice in several hundred pages of recorded testimony. The imagination and the greater revelations it produces offer possibilities so teasingly unlimited, at least in the eyes of Frost and her co-plaintiffs, as to constitute a threat to God. Early in her testimony Frost is asked by attorney Michael Farris to ac- count for additional features of what Frost has termed "godless supernaturalism": Q: Are there any other examples that you need to point out to explain different aspects of godless supernaturalism? A: There are numerous examples that have to do with the im- agination and because it is in the imagination of man and thought of man where these concepts are practiced. The danger of the unfettered imagination continued to be a theme in Frost's testimony. In summarizing her objections to a story about Leonardo Da Vinci, entitled "Great Waves Break- ing," found in the eighth-grade Holt reader, Frost quotes the text itself as the source of her objection, noting how the story develops the idea that "the human mind has unknown capabili- ties for imagination, intelligence, and creativity." As Frost fur- ther points out, the selection suggests that Da Vinci created "flawlessly like God himself." At no time would Frost grant Joseph Campbell's contention that all great religions, mythologies, poetries, and mystic tradi- tions possess an "inspiriting vision" essential to civilization. The role of imagination, says Campbell, is "to cleanse the doors of perception to the wonder, at once terrible and fasci- nating, of ourselves and of the universe of which we are the ears and eyes and the mind."1 That imaginative literature, al- beit in the diluted form offered by the State, performs such a function, is the origin of the Greeneville plaintiffs' contention.</page><page sequence="4">416 SOUNDINGS M. К. Smith and D.E. Francisco Ironically, they are objecting to the means, the only means in our time, by which the life of the spirit is renewed and granted its proper possibility. One is reminded of Flannery O'Connor's observation that the problem for the twentieth century writer with Christian preoccupations (and, we can assume, anyone with such concerns) is that the moribund language of Christi- anity connects us with neither a remembered past nor a pro- jected future. Only literature can offer possibilities for rediscovering the presentational immediacy that the religious life, in its broadest sense, requires. The attack upon literature and upon the ability of literature to meet the mythological requirements of the hour has been made easier by the State's emphasis on a pluralism that grants equal interpretation to all. Under the rubric of tolerance and a fair-minded insistence on a curriculum of valueless values, the State finds itself enfranchising special educational interest groups with the power to challenge the State's own preroga- tives. At no time was the State's dilemma more apparent in the Greeneville textbook controversy than when Vickie Frost first asked that Protestant Christianity receive parity of representa- tion with such religions as Buddhism and Hinduism, only to shift her emphasis in mid-testimony, insisting that a child's be- ing exposed to different religious philosophies resulted in "confusion." Their flaws, she acknowledged, ought to be pointed out. The states' attorneys, seven of them, either never saw or chose to ignore Frost's conflicting desires and her manipula- tion of the prerogatives of the state public educational system to undermine that system. Perhaps they were reeling from Frost's assault upon texts which had been selected without a clearly defined ethos or principle and which, predictably, could only be vapid, generalized, abstract, generic, and colorless. As Flannery O'Connor also observed, stories must be about peo- ple who are "from somewhere." The Holt textbook stories aren't about anybody living anywhere under authentic circum- stances. One need only compare the vivid Biblical imagery of the story of David and Goliath with the philosophical meander- ings found in the aforementioned narrative of Leonardo Da Vinci to understand what the state was up against.</page><page sequence="5">The War Over Words 417 Even magic, the presence of the occult, and communication with animals could not rescue the stories from tedium or keep them from teetering between extremes of the ridiculous and the sublime. Frost herself did not miss the mark when para- phrasing a story entitled "Myax and the Wolves": She [the thirteen year old protagonist] leaves her husband to run away and find herself in a dangerous situation, stranded in ice and cold, and she is going to starve, and so she tries to commu- nicate and develop a relationship with this gentle, or with this wolf, which she calls Gentle Ben, so that he will provide food for her, and in the end of the story, she becomes one of the pack. Not once, it seems, did the selection committee for the Ten- nessee Official List of Textbooks ever asked whether there is anything of ultimate concern for students in these selections. At one point one of the State's lawyers asked Frost, "Is it true that you don't let your children watch Sesame Street}" By attempting to show that Vickie Frost regarded the Sesame Street series as harmful, the attorney actually managed to demon- strate how unthreatening and without affect the series and, by analogy, the Holt texts really were. Judge Hull recognized the absurdity of the State's defense and chided the committee of attorneys who, he suggested, needed to do additional home- work. They were making the case for Frost and her co-plaintiffs without realizing it. In all fairness, no other defense was possible. The State's attorneys apparently believed public education to be nothing more than a vehicle for the equal representation of ideas. This position gave Frost the means with which to confront the State with its own argument. For if there was one thing upon which the attorneys for the State of Tennessee and Vickie Frost agreed, it was that pluralism ought to be the rule of thumb en- suring the rights of each person in the selection of appropriate texts. Frost and the co-plaintiffs were simply taking the state at its own word. Each side failed to see that it was adopting the other's conceptual framework so as to guarantee the exclusion of texts that would offer children possibilities of imaginative ex- pansion, correction, and renewal. Thus, while the State was in- sisting on vapidity and Frost on a principle of archaism, no one seemed to notice or mind that a year earlier, in 1984, John</page><page sequence="6">41 8 SOUNDINGS M. К. Smith and D.E. Francisco Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men had been removed from the shelves of the public high school libraries in nearby Knoxville, home of the state university. The Case for the Plaintiffs There will be nothing singularly memorable about the Greeneville textbook case apart from the decision. No one will rush to write a play or make a film about one of the more chal- lenging moments in recent educational history. If Darrow and Bryan were capable of inspiring a rhetorical maelstrom in the grand tradition of nineteenth-century oratory and old-fash- ioned stump preaching, the Greeneville litigants managed to produce nothing more than sixteen hundred pages of soporific legalese. It was a case of speaking in unknown tongues. Frost mim- icked the lawyers in her mastery of pseudo-legal terminology, and the lawyers mimicked Frost in their use of the very text- book jargon they seemed reluctant to defend. Only Robert Coles, the Harvard psychologist and author, managed to un- tangle the syntax for a time, answering questions in language that was at once forthright, natural and idiomatic. Predictably, neither side made much of his testimony. Judge Hull, who'd permitted numerous digressions through- out the trial, granted the State's motion that its attorneys, and anyone else who wished, be given liberty to enter and leave the courtroom as they pleased. Obviously no one was going to miss much of importance, and if he did, someone was bound to repeat it. Frost came armed with an encyclopedic heft of examples from basal readers she claimed to have spent more than two hundred hours perusing. She was asked about her objections to the Holt texts. Q; Do you object to these Holt textbooks on religious grounds because they exclude the theme of Biblical Protestantism from the books? Given the state's official posture of pluralism, Frost had only to answer in the affirmative. However, she was quick to qualify her original contention, suggesting that her primary objection was not simply one of omission.</page><page sequence="7">The War Over Words 419 A: That is not my understanding. I object because they attack our Biblical beliefs. A point of controversy thus arose over "wording." There were indeed sixteen specific objectionable features found in the Holt readers, Frost claimed, and she opposed not only the omission of some themes but also the treatment of others. Frost was more than willing to provide an exegesis of numer- ous stories, poems and essays that failed to coincide with her understanding of the Bible. The state, sensing the precariousness of its position and un- derestimating Frost's logic, wondered why she did not send her children to a school of private affiliation, one whose dogma was consonant with her own. She responded by saying that she could not afford to send her children to a private school. To all appearances Frost appeared to occupy an unenviable, if not en- tirely desperate, position. On the one hand, the State refused to acknowledge her children's right to their religious beliefs; on the other hand, the State would find the co-plaintiffs in con- tempt for removing their children from public school. Besides, Frost maintained, it was the State's responsibility to educate their children. On the basis ofthat argument Judge Hull, who had in an earlier hearing ruled against the plaintiffs, was now inclined to consider Frost's objections. Despite the State's frequent contention that the plaintiffs' at- torneys were leading the witness, Frost and her attorney man- aged at times an almost uninterrupted dialogue. Frost successfully manipulated an argument normally invoked to thwart efforts at censorship. This argument, known as total ef- fect, maintains that portions of a text taken out of context can- not be deemed objectionable, that such portions must be judged on the basis of their entire treatment within the work. That Noah is seduced by his daughters does not make the book of Genesis pornographic given that the total effect of the epi- sode is to show incest to be wrong. Similarly, Frost did not object to the presence of telepathy, magic, anthropomorphism, or evolution, in the Holt texts. What she opposed was the absence of a disclaimer, suggesting these themes to be morally offensive. Most selections, Frost argued, not only provided no disclaimer, but actually condoned such themes. In "Seeing Beneath the Surface," a selection</page><page sequence="8">420 SOUNDINGS M. К. Smith and D.E. Francisco from the seventh-grade reader, To See Ourselves, students learn about "the mental processes of observing, interpreting and transforming one's world with the third eye, the inner eye of the imagination." The third eye is, of course, an ancient phe- nomenon taken seriously by a number of religious traditions. But the selections suggest further that, although "no one has ever looked at an atom, men and women with strong third eyes have seen the structures of those tiny bits, ten-billionths of an inch big. No one has seen through the earth, but men and wo- men with hunting dog's minds and vast imaginations have seen the world like an open apple."2 At this point one is inclined to wonder whether Frost's ap- preciation of the numinous episodes found in the Bible isn't circumscribed by her own narrow imagination. After all, Elijah saw fiery wheels before being carried off by a chariot into heaven; Moses' staff became a serpent; and the book of Jonah offers the greatest fish story ever told. However, the problem for Frost was not so much her inability to believe as an inability on the part of the Holt editors to make distinctions. Some things, highly problematic, are nonetheless capable of being believed; others are not. The Holt selection never makes this distinction. In fact, the obligatory section on further discussion following "Seeing Beneath the Surface" implies the value of not making distinctions between objective reality, i.e., the ex- perience of the senses, and subjective reality, the horizon of the imagination. The discussion exercise reads as follows: "Ex- plain the difference between the real world and the world of imagination, adding whether or not you think either world is more important than the other."3 Such fuzziness, as she saw it, was a prime target in Frost's criticism of another story entitled, "A Visit to Mars," found in her daughter's sixth-grade reader. Frost noted that the story depicted man as God, a fallacy she called "futuristic superna tu- ralism." According to the plaintiff, the story "portrays thought transfers and telepathy and does so in such a way that it could be considered a scientific concept." When asked whether she saw any "correlation between evolution and the idea that men will ultimately develop these third eyes, or telepathy," Frost an- swered yes, adding that the story showed man to be "continu- ally evolving to a better state. This is just one of the mind</page><page sequence="9">The War Over Words 421 powers that he seeks to increase, his mind's capabilities to save himself, to be his own savior, to rule his world apart from God." Frost's admonition sounds remarkably like that offered by John Milton in Paradise Lost, when he reminds us that "The mind is its own place and, in itself, can make a heaven of hell, or a hell of heaven." What is different is how Frost and Milton arrive at this conclusion. Milton warns of the dangers of an unfounded imagination by invoking a mythology that could only be fathomed imaginatively but did not depend upon the imagination for its existence. Milton assumed the divinely in- spired hierarchy of existence, the Great Chain of Being, to have an ontology of its own. Somewhat ironically, Frost argues for the circumscription of imaginative power by appealing to scien- tific authority, to the data of reason. She demands that telepa- thy fulfill the requirements of a scientific concept. A final example goes to the core of Frost's concern with con- flicting mythologies. In attacking the anthropomorphism found in "The Importance of Folklore," from the fifth grade reader Freedom 's Ground, Frost quotes a long passage emphasiz- ing the role of technology in separating man from nature. "An- imals," argues the text, "were [once] not alone in having a spirit. Trees and animals, mountains, elements were all related to people and were considered to be like them in many ways."4 The selection concludes rather laconically that "technological advances [have taken] people to the moon, but the water and the air are polluted, the earth abused. Perhaps the tales and myths that reveal old relationships of mutual dependence can help reunite modern civilization and nature."5 It is this appeal to a mythology of mutual dependence inspired by an ecological crisis that Frost unequivocally rejected as moral absolutism. The plaintiff asked the court to consider the person who "has a different view of animals, who hunts animals and finds nothing morally wrong with it." Once again, Frost's case is consistent. If man ought to reject a mythology which compares him with God, then he should also scorn one which suggests too close a kinship with animals. In Frost's scheme, which is hardly untraditional, man occupies an important and singular place in existence. Mythologies that fail to acknowledge man's distinctiveness are short-sighted and</page><page sequence="10">422 SOUNDINGS M. К. Smith and D.E. Francisco erroneous. Given the State's precept of tolerance, however, such themes as anthropomorphism and "one world govern- ment" (Frost's words) are an inescapable ideological conse- quence of trying to adopt a posture of all-inclusiveness, of undogmatic dogma. Unfortunately for the State, this position omitted one feature: the single dogma that would challenge its assumptions. The State was defending the possibility of value- less values, such an assumption was itself a value. Frost and her co-plaintiffs had only to expose the contradictions in the State's insistence that the Greeneville school children receive the letter of a spiritless education. First, Brenda Marshall of Church Hill was called to testify on behalf of the plaintiffs. She had once requested an alternative reader to Riders on the Earth for her sixth-grade daughter Gina. Although both the principal and assistant principal saw nothing wrong with the texts used in the classroom, they permitted Mrs. Marshall's daughter to have an alternative text for several months. Then, inexplicably, the book was taken away and Gina was suspended from school three times for refusing to attend reading class. According to school officials, separate texts hampered a teacher's ability to teach reading. This was the testimony of Evelyn Rodriguez, a first-grade teacher at Carters Valley Ele- mentary School. However, in direct examination, Rodriguez also admitted having once adopted a supplemental phonics text, one not found on the Tennessee List of Official Text- books. If teachers could admit the use of texts in some circum- stances, the plaintiffs wondered, then why couldn't they permit supplemental readers in other, more individualized circum- stances? It was a question the State was forced to address more than once. The plaintiffs ended their case by insisting that they had no recourse but to send their children to public schools where every reading assignment ignored or challenged their chil- dren's values. What is apparent, however, is that Frost and her neighbors were challenging the imagery and assumptions of texts whose deliberate omission of particular themes only ren- dered those themes more ostensible. And in fact the texts did offer very little of song or story that might, in the words of Wil- liam Carlos Williams, reconcile "the people and the stones."</page><page sequence="11">The War Over Words 423 Nevertheless, the Greeneville plaintiffs understood the source of an impulse toward "despised poetry" (again, Wil- liams); they recognized the possibility for unfathomable realiza- tions offered by the best traditions of literature and language, even when those traditions were being diluted or ignored. The State, on the other hand, seemed ignorant of the very tradi- tions it sought to invoke. The Defense There was reason for optimism in the defense attorneys' camp at the beginning of the trial. How could the State possi- bly lose to a group of fundamentalist parents who seemed only to mock the very idea of a democratic education? The defense would be based on two presumably impenetrable premises: that it has a compelling interest to decide how its future citizens are to be educated and that the basis of this education is to be a practical pluralism, i.e., the ability to practice toleration and understand diversity. If the parents won, the State argued, it would mean a complete fragmentation of the public school sys- tem, the death of diversity. Unfortunately, both premises were far from impregnable. "We're all in this together in the public schools," argued William Farmer, an attorney for the State. "We're trying to learn about each other, trying to learn a State curriculum, and we're not entitled to be treated separately. There is no right to be treated separately." The State does have a compelling in- terest to educate its citizens, the argument continued. The State curriculum, the embodiment of this interest, must remain intact - to be partly "in" it and partly "out of" it would destroy the foundations it is trying to build. If the parent's request for alternative readers could be shown to be ultimately destructive to a unified curriculum, then the State would win. What are these foundations? How is the curriculum de- cided? Are the requests of these parents unreasonable? For instance, how is a textbook adopted for classroom use? The general procedure varies from state to state, but the guide- lines for Tennessee will demonstrate a typical process. The Tennessee Curriculum process works on a six-year cy- cle, beginning with "state and local needs assessment," and closing with the adoption of textbooks for a five-year period.</page><page sequence="12">424 SOUNDINGS M. К. Smith and D.E. Francisco In the early part of the process, the State determines the curric- ulum framework outlines (i.e., what it considers to be the skills necessary to be taught in classrooms) and supplies these guide- lines to textbook publishers, who then become responsible for providing (or writing) textbooks that fulfill these requirements. The State Textbook Commission (composed of the Commis- sioner of Education, three lay citizens, and six educators from various regions of the state) then meets to review and approve a list of official textbooks. Local schoolboards then step in. The superintendent of a local school system appoints three to five teachers to represent the system in reviewing and recommending textbooks to the local Board of Education. The local committees recommend the adoption of the basal textbooks and any alternative texts to be used at each grade level. Three types of texts are allowed: The basal text is the one that local boards of education are en- couraged to adopt and make available for most students. Only one basal text per subject in each grade level is adopted. Alternative texts, up to five of them, may be adopted by a local school district to address the needs of students not on grade level. Such books are typically designated as "low-level" or "advanced" in the Official List of Textbooks. These books can be purchased in lieu of the basal text for a limited number of students. Local systems do have the option of adopting a book or series at an alternative level text even though it has not been so designated in the official list. Supplementary materials listed by the State Textbook Commission may be used in con- junction with the basal text. What starts as a determined effort to control curricula has quickly fractured into a local free-for-all, with some of the fea- tures of a county fair. From memos describing textbook selec- tion: "Publishers sponsor special presentations for local textbook adoption committees from late January through mid- April. These special presentations, known as the Textbook Caravan, provide an opportunity for local adoption committees to hear detailed presentations about a particular series or book which they are interested in adopting."6 Local systems may even disregard the State recommendations and adopt alterna- tive texts as they see fit.</page><page sequence="13">The War Over Words 425 At any point in the process, objections to material in a text- book can lead to its rejection. Textbooks have to be thorough but non-offensive. As such, publishers tend toward slick, plu- ralistic productions. As Constance Holden noted in a recent Science article, "Textbook publishers are clearly in a bind. Don- ald A. Eklund of the Association of American Publishers says publishers are intimidated by the 'social content guidelines' and bend over backwards - when a guideline says no religion should be held up to ridicule, for example, it may be better to omit any description of Mormonism rather than to say the reli- gion accepts polygamy. Because of the California dislike for junk foods, even birthday cakes are omitted from stories."7 Fragmentation is not only widespread in the textbooks but in special curricula as well. Special groups have their materials: handicapped students, gifted, minorities, and on and on. We can perhaps see why the plaintiffs argued: "You take into ac- count all of these other special groups and give them special treatment; why not these parents?" The handicapped have their special curricula, the gifted their own, what about the Protestants? Shouldn't religious groups be classified as minori- ties? On these points the plaintiffs have a strong case: There is no clear conception of how the State curriculum is determined and whom it should serve. The foundation is already frag- mented, and the parents only brought about another crack. The only part of the curriculum that both sides agreed is val- uable is the standardized test, the evaluative outcome given at the end of a student's school year. If the children are "part in" and "part out" of the curriculum, the State argued, they will perform poorly on the tests. The lawyer for the plaintiffs agreed: "Tennessee does have a compelling interest in seeing that children can read," argued Michael Farris, "but not these other things" (role playing, value judgments, etc.). Test just "reading" and nothing else, things the standardized tests at- tempt; for instance the California Achievement Test measures only "the actual skill levels of knowledge." Wouldn't it be hard to test just reading and not what the children are reading about? Actually, standardized tests come close to this goal, but in so doing they define education as success in manipulating words and sentences and not in understanding ideas: gram- mar, not rhetoric; the right answer, not imaginative responses;</page><page sequence="14">426 SOUNDINGS M. К. Smith and DE. Francisco standardization, not toleration or diversity. Unwittingly, the State and the parents have conspired to define public education merely as performance on standardized tests, clearly the least offensive and perhaps the least useful aspect of an education. Toleration and Diversity What is it to be in this curriculum? What will be taught to the children? Timothy Dyk, attorney for People for the Ameri- can Way, for the defense: Public schools "exist so that people with different religious viewpoints, different philosophical viewpoints, different backgrounds, can get together so they can learn about each other, so they can learn to be tolerant because that is one of the highest obligations of any citizen in this coun- try." The plaintiffs are objecting, he continues, to the essence of public education, which is the desire to teach children about tolerance, diversity, and imagination. But in its attempt to define education as a pluralistic struc- ture which tolerates all while condemning none, the State in- stead has promulgated a consistent non-offensiveness, or what is more aptly named by the plaintiffs, "secular humanism." This "humanism," however, does not intersect with the Greek, Renaissance, or Enlightenment notions of the term. The State's humanism centers instead on whatever the current no- tions of human relations are, as espoused in the contemporary ethos and sociology of education. As we saw earlier, Frost argued that the State does have a philosophy, a value structure, that is consistently communi- cated through its textbooks. She convinced Judge Hull of these implications. In his decision he notes: It appears to the Court that many of the objectionable passages in the Holt books would be rendered inoffensive, or less offensive, in a more balanced context. The problem with the Holt series, as it relates to the plaintiffs' beliefs, is one of degree. One story reinforces and builds upon the others throughout the individual texts and the series as whole. The plaintiffs believe that, after reading the entire Holt series, a child might adopt the views of a feminist, a humanist, a pacifist, an anti-Christian, a vegetarian, or an advocate of "one-world government." The State's imagery, its "religion," has become offensive, even though every attempt has been made to keep it inoffen- sive. We can almost hear the selection committees at work: "If</page><page sequence="15">The War Over Words 427 we can't say something good about a particular group or view- point, then don't mention it at all. If we've ignored certain groups over the years - women, blacks, Indians - then by all means mention them a lot now to make up for past injustice." The parents in this case have objected to the values implicit in the State's supposedly valueless philosophy, and other Protes- tant groups throughout the country will continue to hold the same in other courts of law. What started as a good-hearted attempt to incorporate different groups into the mainstream of the American educational and philosophical tradition has turned into a barren landscape, in which wounded prey will be easy targets for even the most amateurish of hunters. Even the State does not know how to defend an indefensible curriculum. Is the State really forcing a religion on these chil- dren? William Farmer: "Children are not being forced to be- lieve anything. They are not being forced to practice anything. We have a public school curriculum that we have offered to them. They are welcome to it." Dr. Robert Coles, of Harvard, probably the most eloquent of all the witnesses, did provide a consistent argument for what public education should encom- pass - values, empathy, imagination, critical thinking, the bal- ance between independent judgment and one's responsibilities and affiliations to a community, the moral imagination. But the State focused on a minor finding of his monumental work Chil- dren of Crisis - that the beliefs children are taught at home are not necessarily changed when students go to school. The argu- ment was used to show that schooling has no effect, that expo- sure to toleration and diversity may not change your ideas about these subjects. The State cannot apparently educate or change the minds or hearts of its children. But the hunting continues. Parents first argue that they sim- ply want to be tolerated - to have the right to teach their chil- dren their values without interference, and let the State teach the other things - reading, mathematics, skills. Tolerate us, the plaintiffs argue, allow us our own books, let us be part of the diversity. As Farris said, "We're asking for diversity in choice, they're asking for uniformity in coercion." Provide alterna- tives. But in the plaintiffs' heart of hearts there is only one al- ternative, and that is the way of their own religious beliefs. The defense clearly saw the danger: let this group in and others will</page><page sequence="16">428 SOUNDINGS M. К. Smith and D.E. Francisco follow. But the plaintiffs objected: "Others will storm in? But where are the Hawkins County Catholics for Choice, Hawkins County Lutherans for Liberty, Hawkins County Protesting Pentecostals?" They are not visible yet, but the ground is set for the skirmishes to continue. The Burden of Education The State argued that it was too expensive to accommodate all these religious groups and their alternative textbooks. The plaintiffs answered that parents cannot afford private religious schools or at-home schooling. In his judgment Judge Hull made the State responsible for the expense: you must furnish an education to your citizens, as you want, but do it in such a manner that you do not violate their religious beliefs. He de- nied the plaintiffs' request for alternative texts but did allow a student to leave the classroom whenever an "offensive" pas- sage was being read or discussed. The burden goes to the State and this is how it should be. But how is the State to define public education so as not to be at the mercy of every religious sectarian philosophy that might claim offense at what is taught in the classroom? The heart of education is to develop the ability to choose, critically, between different alternatives and to exert the "moral imagination." Thomas Jefferson knew this instinctively. In Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge, he postulated that education in a democracy is the burden of the State, the burden of helping its citizens realize the nature of governments and the nature of man - the best way to prevent degeneration into tyranny: ". . .and it is believed that the most effectual means of prevent- ing this would be, to illuminate, as far as practicable, the minds of the people at large, and more especially to give them knowl- edge of those facts, which history exhibiteth, that, possessed thereby of the experience of other ages and countries, they may be enabled to know ambition under all its shapes, and prompt to exert their natural powers to defeat its purposes."8 The best weapon against tyranny is reason. In his Bill for Es- tablishing Religious Freedom, we see Jefferson's understanding of the "toleration" of religions. The Almighty chose not to prop- agate by coercion but by reason and we must guard against those who "[set] up their own opinions and modes of thinking</page><page sequence="17">The War Over Words 429 as the only true and infallible." Furthermore, Jefferson says, "truth is great and will prevail if left to herself; . . . she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate; errors ceas- ing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them."9 Let us compare religions, governments, ideas, books, people. Let free argument and debate be the cornerstone of education. Learn to know ambition under its many guises. But in order to use reason effectively we must be able to see both sides of an argument, to understand or imagine the issues in a conflict. This strikes at the heart of the argument against using "offen- sive" materials in the classroom. For in order to exert reason, to use the moral imagination, we must at times consider the "offensive." Very well, argues Michael Farris, but the plaintiffs don't want the textbooks to dwell upon offensive material, such as sin, all the time. "But the Bible dwells upon sin all the time," remarked Dr. Coles. Children have to be able to under- stand moral conflict. Mr. Farris objected to stories that want children to imagine someone shooting up heroin. "But our President has just sent troops to Bolivia to stop the making of heroin so that school kids can't shoot it," continued Dr. Coles. "It seems to me that our children going to the public schools of this country do have to use their moral imagination to under- stand what shooting up heroin is about and why this President has done what he has done." The details of reality, especially sordid reality, are, however, to be avoided; if it is "offensive," then children must not be exposed to it for fear of contamina- tion, for fear of soiling the spirit. How then do we obtain books that will not offend? First, real books, those within a coherent tradition of imaginative litera- ture, must be censored or omitted from the curriculum. Sec- ond, real books must be replaced by textbooks, cornucopias of ideas commissioned by committees, books not by anyone, about anyone, or even for anyone. Bruno Bettelheim and Karen Ze- lan, in On Learning to Read, make the case against current prac- tice: "If, rather than concentrating on developing reading skills, educational efforts from the very beginning were concen- trated on developing the desire to become literate - essentially,</page><page sequence="18">430 SOUNDINGS M. К. Smith and D.E. Francisco an inner attitude to reading - then the final result might be that a much larger segment of the adult population would be liter- ate."10 Textbooks are not authentic - they have no "authors," are not set in realistic situations, have no values attached to them, and are essentially "empty." Even the fantastic stories in the textbook are insipid and unimaginative. No wonder chil- dren grow bored and become adults who do not delight in reading. Bettelheim and Zelan make a case for primers like those used in many European educational systems. These primers "treat the beginning reader with respect for his intelli- gence, for his interest in the more serious aspects of life, and with the recognition that from the earliest age on he will re- spond positively to writings of true literary merit."11 Real books and real issues, then, must be addressed, but these are usually the most "offensive" and the ones most likely to be censored. It is no coincidence that most censorship trials, past and present, have focused on imaginative literature. For in imaginative literature we have real authors tackling real problems, problems which certain segments of society may want to avoid rather than face squarely. In literature, there are heroes and villains, adults that are admirable and adults that are disgusting. Consider some of the books that the State has acquiesced in banning: The Catcher in the Rye, The Grapes of Wrath, Huckleberry Finn, and Of Mice and Men. No wonder Reli- gion wants to ban these books, the State to deny them. Judge Hull clearly saw the problem when he denied the plaintiffs' re- quest for alternative texts and merely allowed the children to leave the classroom when the offensive texts were being dis- cussed: "It is hard to imagine any reading program for the plaintiffs offered at the schools which would not present Estab- lishment Clause problems." For education to flourish in a democratic society, the State must support and defend that which is truly "human," and not merely "religious" or "scientific." What is human has a past, a present, and, one hopes, a future and is to be found in the best traditions of literature and language. Education must instill a sense of history and its concomitant lesson, that human beings are always struggling to understand themselves against at- tempts by others merely to define them. Imaginative literature attempts this, and this is what makes it frightening.</page><page sequence="19">The War Over Words 431 Answers to human problems cannot be found in a merely "scientific" view of humanity, something the State is desper- ately hoping for in its current heated battle between its own support of "evolution" and the alternative of "creationism sci- ence." Protestant groups have attacked "evolutionary science" and called for equal exposure to "creationism science," a Bibli- cal alternative to the origin of life and man. The State has been determined in this defense all the way to the Supreme Court. Curiously, the sides are reversed in this controversy. The State no longer argues that anything goes; evolution is a fact and must be taught as such. The lessons of the Scopes trial have been hard won and must be applied, it believes. But now reli- gion no longer wants science instructed as to its error but is merely seeking equal exposure to "Biblical scientific view- points." The State's science is now called religion and Religion now offers its own science. The real issue is not science, nor is it a particular religious view, but the imagination. Darrow and Bryan knew this as they argued during that hot summer in Dayton over fifty years ago. The winner - Science or Religion - would influence the imagi- nation of citizens for years to come. However, in the present case, there is no real winner. That the plaintiffs won the right for their children not to be exposed to objectionable material only guarantees an education wholly dependent upon parental authority, limited by the fears of each succeeding generation. If the State had won, or wins in future cases, the consequences will be the same: education will be controlled by committees and publishers whose ultimate vision is limited to six-year cy- cles. And the only casualty is the imagination, that vehicle of self-analysis and self-renewal learned through education, which is the citizen's only true defense in a democracy. Imagination is the business of education; the State must finally have the cour- age to defend this privilege against those who would take it from our children. Postscript In late August of 1987, the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision in the Greeneville textbook trial. The plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, but in early 1988 this body refused to hear the case.</page><page sequence="20">432 SOUNDINGS M.K. Smith and D.E. Francisco Spokesmen for the State of Tennessee celebrated this victory by proclaiming that reason had finally prevailed. Their ebul- lience would have been tempered if they had read carefully the rationale for reversal offered by the Sixth Circuit Court. Judge Lively, in his decision, remarked that the main question to be decided "is whether a governmental requirement that a person be exposed to ideas he or she finds objectionable on religious grounds constitutes a burden on the free exercise of that per- son's religion as forbidden by the First Amendment." On con- stitutional grounds, he found that mere "exposure" to objectionable material was not such a burden: "The only con- duct compelled by the defendants was reading and discussing the material in the Holt series, and hearing other students' in- terpretations of those materials. This is the exposure to which the plaintiffs objected. What is absent from this case is the crit- ical element of compulsion to affirm or deny a religious belief or to engage or refrain from engaging in a practice forbidden or required in the exercise of the plaintiff's religion." Thus the State is in the unenviable position of affirming that no ideas it offers can be "compelling" enough to change anyone's beliefs about anything. As the fundamentalists retreat into their Christian academies or entrench themselves on local textbook committees, biding their time, the State continues to celebrate, but an opportunity has been lost for it to affirm what is of greatest value in the education of a democracy.
