<plain_text><page sequence="1">Red Fox: The Catlike Canine by ]. Dnvid Henry 174pp. $22.50. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1986. Although the red fox is a canid, it bears remarkable similarities to the cat family in morphology and behavior. Like a cat, the red fox has semiretract able claws, daggerlike canine teeth, and vertical-slit eye pupils. Contrary to their more social canine cousins, foxes are solitary creatures that stalk and ambush their prey like cats. The fox's secretive ways have served it well: After 30 million years of evolution it continues to adapt successfully to modern environments. In Red Fox: The Catlike Canine, Henry identifies and interprets several of the red fox's adaptive strategies in chap ters on hunting, caching, courtship, kit rearing, and scent marking. Based on numerous experiments and obser vations, Henry reveals some surpris ing purposes behind fox caching and subsequent urine marking behavior. Ironically, when one fox steals another fox's food cache, its behavior benefits the species as a whole. A fox will in evitably forget where it has cached all of its food; thus, stealing results in retrieval of caches that would have otherwise been wasted or left to another species to consume. NSTA Helps You Handle the Hard Questions Modern Science and the Book of Genesis by James W. Skehan The teacher who encounters the contemporary resurgence of Crea tionism will be on solid ground with this summary of the main stream religious/scientific position. A specialist in geology, geophys ics, philosophy, and theology re ports on the age-old dialogue between faith and science, includ ing such noble efforts as Athana sius Kircher's seventeenth-century attempt to prove (with scale draw ings reproduced in this pamphlet) how the Ark could hold all 130 species of animals then known. 1986,32 pp. $5.00 Teaching about Nuclear War To understand the arms race, students need an understanding of politics and social systems, the mechanics of nuclear bombs, and the physiological and environ mental effects of bombs.

The book concludes with a discussion of rare fox behaviors. Henry insists that the unusual events, as well as the routine, may provide important in sights into fox psychology. Traditional science demands that a researcher abandon sympathetic feel ing for the "object" of the study. Another taboo is suggesting that an animal may enjoy emotions and thoughts. Henry goes beyond this limited approach by entering the world of the fox as an anthropologist im mersed in a foreign culture. His in formed empathy, based on 14 years of rigorous research, transcends both anthropomorphism and the view of animal as instinctual machine. The distinguished primatologist Jane Good all stated of Henry's book, "Without this caring, no animal study . . . can hope to be successful." I recommend Red Fox: The Cntlike Canine to teachers and students from junior high through college. It is a beautifully illustrated, personal account of the author's substantial knowledge and abiding wonder of the red fox. Henry offers the reader an intimate portrait of what field biologists do and how they think. Equally important, he portrays science as a continuing edu cation that rewards an open mind and heart.
