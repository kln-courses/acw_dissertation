Herakles' struggle with a sea-monster was a popular subject among Attic black-figure vase painters. There are probably more than 160 representations of this theme extant; 137 of them are illustrated and exhausti- vely discussed by Ahlberg-Cornell. Both the scheme of representation and the identity of Herakles' opponent change in time. In the earliest Attic renderings, Herakles is shown in profile astride and parallel to the monster and both usually face in the same direction. Later, the bodies of the combatants appear to cross, the sea-monster's frontal chest overlaps Herakles' and the antagonists face in opposite directions. Although inscriptions are scarce, in the earliest represen- tations the monster is occasionally identified as 'Nereus'. Later he is called 'Triton' and the label 'Nereus' is attached to an old man, with nothing monstrous about him, who sometimes witnesses the struggle. Our literary sources tell us something about Herakles' wrestling match with Nereus: Herakles had to cling on to the metamorphosing monster until he forced him to reveal the way to the garden of the Hesperides. On the subject of Herakles' struggle with Triton, our literary</page><page sequence="2">260 NOTICES OF BOOKS sources are silent, even though he seems to be the opponent who is more favoured by the vase painters. After a brief introduction, A.-C. devotes chs 2-6 to enumeration and discussion of the vases under consider- ation. She divides the material into 11 groups, princi- pally on chronological grounds. Most groups are presented under five headings: List of vases, State of preservation, Dating and attribution, Iconographic outline, and Development. In Group I'Development' is replaced by 'Tradition and novelty in the first Attic black-figure specimens' and in Groups VII and X it is replaced by 'Discussion'. Chs 7-10 present summaries and conclusions. An appendix is devoted to the iconographic structure and the figure field of the tondo of a kylix in Tarquinia. The illustrations include 38 figures distributed un- heralded in unexpected places throughout the text and 49 plates, with (generally) good-quality reproductions of the 137 items catalogued. The conclusions mostly repeat the material already discussed in the exposition and are disappointingly unilluminating. A.-C. does not believe that the change from representations of Nereus as the sea-monster to those of Triton as the sea-monster was a sudden one, nor is she convinced that all early representations of the struggle are intended to show Nereus and all later ones Triton. One of her most adventurous ideas is the suggestion that Attic artists might have been attracted to the theme as a way of expressing the triumph of Solon's legislation (Herakles) over social stasis (the sea- monster) but, as she herself admits, there is little evidence to support this hypothesis. Altogether the text seems too detailed and repetitive, but the chief defect of the book lies in its highly idiosyncratic use of the English language. Mrs Ann Martin is credited with having revised the English text, and she, perhaps, rather than the author should be blamed for usage that often puzzles or confuses the reader and sometimes becomes totally impenetrable. From the context one can divine that 'the principle of human figures rowing' has nothing to do with 'messing about in boats' but refers to the representation of processions, and one can perceive that 'interfere' has been used instead of 'infer', but the meaning of phrases like 'the Taleides Painter's slightly society approach to the sea-monster theme' eludes this reader, just as sentences like 'I am inclined to regard this attitude as a pronounciation [sic] half-way formulistic, of the sea- monster's attitude of averting Herakles' choking grip' or 'The painters seem to have approached the theme from an iconographic angle of incidence, showing up their formal skill, playing with the tension and other compositional features, or as in the last phase, reducing its pictorial contents below a possible level' leave me baffled and frustrated. Irritatingly, despite the generally poor level of proof-reading and erratic spelling, 'mon- strous' is mispelled 'monstruous' with perverse consis- tency! The author devotes a paragraph to explaining the convention she has chosen for the transliteration of Greek, but it is hard to imagine that any convention couldjustify 'Korphu' and 'kylices'. These may seem to be trivial points to criticise, but they are so numerous and so distracting that they interfere with the reader's comprehension and appreciation of the material pre- sented, which is anyway perhaps given fuller and more extensive treatment than it really deserves. River-gods rather than sea-monsters are the subject of Carina Weiss' book Griechische Flussgottheiten in vorhellenisticher Zeit: Ikonographie und Bedeutung. Her concern is principally with identification and interpreta- tion, and though she makes use of mythological context when it is relevant to her argument, mythological illustration as such is of little interest to her. The iconography of river-gods in and after the Hellenistic period seems relatively simple and straight- forward. With few exceptions river-gods are repre- sented as reclining bearded men. In earlier times (as W. demonstrates), the situation was far more complex. River-gods could be represented not only as men (either youthful or bearded) or as bulls, but they could also be shown as a mixture of the two. The mixture could range from a predominantly theriomorphic form-a bull with a man's face (used early and often for Acheloos, but also employed for other local river-gods) to a more humanoid man with a bull's head (resembling the Minotaur, but distinguished from him either by inscription or multiplication [see below]-the Mino- taur was a singleton) or finally, a type whose fully anthropomorphic nature is modified by the addition of bull's horns and ears (in which form young river-gods differ from representations of young Pans only in the nature of their horns and their attributes). River-gods could be shown standing, seated, charging or reclining. It is this splendid variety in the pre-Hellenistic iconography of river-gods that is identified, analysed and discussed by W. In eight excellently organized and presented chapters she looks at: River-gods in the Homeric Epics; The Meaning of River-gods on Sicilian and South Italian Coinage; The Meaning of the Bull- man in the Iconography of Greek River-gods; The Emergence of Anthropomorphic River-god Imagery in the Fifth Century B.c.; The Tradition of Reclining River-gods in Pedimental Sculpture; Reflections on the Formation of the Reclining Image for River-gods; River-gods on Votive Reliefs. The illustrations (on I6 plates) are hardly generous, but well-chosen, well-reproduced and sufficiently representative to serve the purposes of the book. This is a thoughtful work in which evidence is thoroughly reviewed and carefully weighed. The images that are considered come from coins, vases and sculptures. Numismatics looms particularly large since coins are geographically localized and often provide identifying inscriptions as well. There are many interesting ideas. For instance, W. suggests that part of the impulse to change from the more grossly theriomorphic representations to more anthropomorphic ones came from the appearance of river-gods in theatrical contexts. She points out that the representation of three dancing 'Minotaurs' on a black- figure hydria in the British Museum is more likely to show us what a chorus of river-gods might have looked like than to portray Pasiphae's son in triplicate. The mediating influence of the theatre in the development of more anthropomorphic imagery suggests analogies with the development of Io iconography (for lo, who seems to have appeared in predominantly bovine form prior to Aeschylus, was afterwards more usually represented as a horned girl), but the author, while remarking on the similarities, notes that different kinds of representations of river-gods could coexist simulta- neously, since they indicated different aspects of river-</page><page sequence="3">NOTICES OF BOOKS 261 gods. She identifies figures A and P in the East pediment at Olympia as Alpheus and Kladeos (respectively) and explains the emergence of fully anthropomorphic river- gods in the fifth century B.C. as part of the general movement toward humanizing the image of monstrous figures that was current at the time. She also points out the way the new imagery could be reinforced by reference to Homer, whose influence on the visual arts then became considerable-cf. Phidias' remarks on the inspiration for his Olympian Zeus. The author combines evidence derived from repre- sentations of river-gods identifiable from inscriptions and those identifiable from mythological context with a critical evaluation of scholarly opinion to develop arguments that are both illuminating and persuasive. This is a valuable and copiously documented work which through its thoroughness and its reasonableness will do much to clear up controversies concerning the iconography, identification and interpretation of river- gods before the Hellenistic period. Mythological illustration as such is the primary interest of J.-M. Moret, both in terms of how it was produced by ancient artists and how it is perceived by modern scholars. Awareness of the distinctness of the literary and visual traditions and exploration of the points at which they overlap or intersect informs the whole of M.'s Oedipe, la Sphinx et les Thibains and this philosophic background makes the book something far deeper than a mere compendium of illustrations. Although she does not receive star billing in the title, the Sphinx is the key figure in M.'s survey. Originally an orientalizing monster like so many others, one particular sphinx emerged from among the decorative borders, votive monuments and grave stele finials to become the riddling Sphinx who plagued the Thebans and was finally undone by Oedipus. It is she who monopolizes the visual tradition, while the other adventures of Oedipus, his parricide and incest, which dominate the literary tradition as we have it, are only seldom illustrated. The main body of the book is devoted to investigat- ing the representations of the Theban Sphinx made by the Greeks, Etruscans and Romans. The illustrations, 96 splendid plates, offer a rich and representative selection. We are shown how in Attic vase painting the sphinx first became popular as a monster either threatening the frightened Thebans who flee from her or carrying off those unlucky ones who have failed to make good their escape. The riddling Sphinx also appears in archaic Attic vase painting, but she poses her questions to the Thebans long before she addresses Oedipus, who, though he appears elsewhere earlier, is not shown on Attic vases before the beginning of the fifth century B.C. Once Oedipus has arrived on the scene, he soon becomes the chief interlocutor of the Sphinx. From the third century B.c. on, a two-figure schema in which a standing Oedipus confronts a sphinx perched on a tall, narrow rock becomes the standard composition on gems. These are very abundant in Hellenistic Italy and provide a link between the Greek and the Roman traditions. The Etruscans only occasionally illustrate the story and introduce the macabre detail of a skull at the foot of the Sphinx's perch, which reappears from time to time in Roman works. For the Romans, Oedipus becomes more important than the Sphinx. Though they depict the tale relatively seldom-Trojan themes were more popular with them-they do so in a wide range of media: in wall painting, stucco and mosaic and on sarcophagi and other stone reliefs and terra-cotta lamps. The Romans standardize the gesture that Oedipus makes, pointing to his face, a gesture that M. shrewdly analyses as one that is influenced by Roman mime. In addition to the obvious chapters on the abducting Sphinx, the Sphinx and the Thebans, Oedipus and the Sphinx, Oedipus and the Sphinx in Magna Graecia, Etruria and the Italic world and Oedipus and the Sphinx on Roman monuments, M. also discusses the column or the rocky perch of the Sphinx, violent conflict between Oedipus and the Sphinx, and visual parodies. His concern is with the interpretation of images and the degree to which they are interpretable. In order to cut through awkward problems he makes use of wide reading in an impressive range of disciplines and well- deployed common sense. For instance, he suggests that Attic representations of the Sphinx perched on a high rock and representations of the Sphinx perched on a column are not reflections of two distinct literary traditions, but alternative visual equivalents for the stipulation that the Sphinx occupies 'a high place'. The literary tradition never hints that this might be a column, but Attic artists made use of an iconographical unit that seemed natural to them and that was apt for their purposes. Roman painters, whose experiences were different, and for whom only divinities had sufficient rank to be put on columns never show the Sphinx elevated in this way. One need not agree with every interpretation that M. offers, but all are carefully thought out, provocative and well documented. M.'s sensitive exploration of mythological illus- tration shows profound respect for the autonomy of the visual tradition and deplores the far from dead nine- teenth century philological approach in which monu- ments are reduced to the level of being nothing more than illustrations of literary versions of myths. At the same time he does not fail to point out that images alone can only communicate a limited amount of information and gives his readers a timely reminder that one cannot decipher the representation of a myth that one does not already know. In terms of both methodology and presentation, this is a fascinating and exemplary book. SUSAN WOODFORD London</page></plain_text>
