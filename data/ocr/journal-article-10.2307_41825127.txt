<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes 6i EARLY PRINT COLLECTING. Antony Griffiths {Print Quarterly , June 1990, pp. 182-84) recently drew attention to a detail in a seventeenth-century Flemish painting showing a cavalier poised before a table of art objects including an album of prints. In his note Griffiths asks whether any such albums from the very early period of print collecting actually survive intact to this day. A number are extant in museum collections, and in fact an extremely interesting collector's album from the late six- teenth century has recently been acquired and laboriously restored by the Rijksmuseum Print Cabinet. Readers will find a full account of it just published in Alexander de Bruin et al., 'Conservatie, restaura tie en onderzoek van een zestiende-eeuws prentenboek: het Heemskerck-album' Bulletin van het Rijksmuseum , xxxvm, 1990, pp. 173-214; with a long English summary (pp. 254-57) • Further biblio- graphy on early albums can be found in the footnotes. We know from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century inventories that albums were a standard means of assembling and dis- playing collections of prints and drawings. (See, for example, the records transcribed in J. Denucé, De Antwerpsche ' Konstkamers ' Antwerp 1932). The most exten- sive intact collections known to us from this period are those of Ferdinand of Tyrol (originally at Schloss Ambras in Innsbruck, and now mostly in Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum) and of Philip II (in the Escorial), both dating from the sixteenth century and both consisting of a great many volumes and many thousands of prints. From these collections as well as other evidence we know it was a common practice in this period to trim prints to their borderlines and paste them down on larger sheets of album paper, sometimes in decorative compositions but mainly like illustrations in the manner of a picture book - prints sometimes mixed with drawings. The Rijks- museum album, mainly but not exclusively composed of Heemskerck prints, has a slightly different format. Here most of the prints apparently retain the generous margins with which they were printed and are pasted back to back and bound on their own paper. This sort of album reflects the habit of the larger print publishing houses active from the second half of the century issuing prints in series for the collector to bind them as they came or assemble them into albums with other cycles, as is the case here. Albums of prints would most likely have become part of the library in a princely or humanist collection (as was true in Ferdinand's case), or be shelved for consultation in a collector's 'art and curiosity cabinet' surrounded by other objects, somewhat as we see it in Flemish 'gallery paintings'. The painting of art collections like this came to be a fashionable genre in its own right during the seven- teenth century, particularly in Flanders and Holland. A number depict prints and drawings, often in albums. These gallery paintings offer another kind of documen- tation of early collecting practices, though one should be careful not to take them too literally as evidence of actual arrangements and display. There have been various studies of gallery paintings, most recently Zirk Z. Filipczak, Picturing Art in Antwerp (Princeton 1987), with further bibliography. Compiling print collections in albums where they were relatively protected from mishandling no doubt had a great influence on the survival rate of old master prints. The remnants of albums emptied of their original contents can be found today on back shelves of many print rooms. It became normal practice from at least the middle of the nineteenth century to disassemble them and remount the prints for reasons of conservation, easier handling and eventual exhibition. Unfortunately, in most cases no record was kept of the arrangement of these albums when they were taken apart by restorers. Our current interest in the history of collecting has turned attention to reconstructing these artefacts of print connoisseurship where possible. The early albums have much to tell us about standards of quality, systems of classifiction and early iconographical schemes. PETER W. PARSHALL GIULIO SANUTO. In 1986 the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh acquired an impression of the strange and rather beautiful three-plate print by Sanuto of Apollo and Marsyas after a painting on a harpsichord cover that is now thought to be by Bronzino. But not con- tent with mere possession, Hugh Macandrew decided that more should be discovered about this very curious print (which has a group from Raphael's Parnassus added in the background with a charming annotation that it was there 'to fill up an empty space') as well as the very obscure artist who made it, and summoned Michael Bury of the Univer- sity of Edinburgh to help. The result was a small exhibition held in late 1990, and a monographic publication, Giulio Sanuto (48 pp., fully illustrated, £7.95). Both are models of their kind, which could and should be emulated by print rooms everywhere. For by close scholarly concentration on a single well-chosen area, they have opened new perspectives on the entire field of sixteenth-century Italian printmaking. Michael Bury's research has been admirably thorough. Hitherto, we knew next to nothing about Sanuto : Bartsch and Passavant compiled a list of a dozen or so plates, from which a certain amount could be deduced, and that was all. We now have a proper catalogue, with the prints that Sanuto actually made separated from the questionable attributions and, thanks to research in the Venetian archives, a biography to attach to the prints. Sanuto turns out to have been a member of the great Sanuto clan : he was the illegitimate son of Francesco, a diplomat, and brother of Livio, a well-known geographer. The definition of his œuvre (and impressions of all his prints were shown in the Edinburgh exhibition) makes him more, rather than</page><page sequence="2">62 NOTES less, interesting, as it shows how very unpredictable he could be, and how widely his engraving style varied. In some prints (cat. i ) he worked in parallel lines, rather like a proto- Scolari ; in others he followed the lines of the pre- liminary drawing precisely (cat. 3 after Domenico Campagnola) ; yet others look like prints of the School of Fontainebleau by Leon Davent (cat. 7). His own style is best revealed in the Apollo and Marsyas. Likewise the artists after whom he engraved make an extraordinary assort- ment - including Bronzino, Giulio Romano, Titian, Michelangelo and Daniele da Volterra - while other prints are more than half-way to popular imagery. Clearly we are in the midst of a visual culture of a wide and unpredict- able kind. But Bury's most surprising discovery was, perhaps, that Sanuto was and is a well-known map engraver. Unknown to print historians, map historians have been piecing together his œuvre in their field, and six different maps or sets of maps are listed in this catalogue. Among them are twelve maps for Livio Sanuto's Geografia. . . dell'Africa , pub- lished in 1 588, and twelve plates of gores for what was at the time the largest globe yet produced. It was to explore this link between printmaking and mapmaking that a one- day conference was held in Edinburgh on 1 December I990- Four papers were read, by Professor Martin Kemp, Dr Denis Cosgrove, Dr Ian Morrison and Michael Bury him- self. No summary of their contents can be attempted here, but some of the most interesting points raised for the print historian can perhaps be reported to a wider audience. The central lesson was that printmaking and mapmaking were far more intimately linked than is normally realized. The two centres in Italy were Rome and Venice, the latter by far the more important. Indeed, between about 1540 and 1 575 Venice was the most important centre of mapmaking in Europe, being the central point at which information about the new discoveries was drawn together. There were many competing publishers there, among them Bertelli, Forlani and Pagano - all of whom are equally well-known as print publishers. The greatest cartographer of the period, Gastaldi, published his own maps (which were engraved by Sanuto, Fabio Licinio and Enea Vico or cut by Matteo Pagano - again, all well-known to the print historian), while Mercator found it worth his while to take out privileges in Venice to protect his own maps. This information comes from Bury's paper, which was full of fascinating details for the print historian. Thus he quoted from the catalogue of an Augsburg publisher pre- pared for the Frankfurt book fair of 1 573 : of 80 maps listed, 68 were Venetian. What does this imply for the distribu- tion of prints? The Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae of Lafréry is usually thought to be the earliest collection of miscellaneous sheets bound together with a standard title- page ; but apparently Bertelli was doing this with his maps earlier, and was imitated by Lafréry. There were still wider considerations : Bury argued that the experience of map- making influenced the way in which engravers filled up empty space, and demonstrated that the so-called ' Weltlandschaf ť was no Northern specialism, but was equally at home in Venice. If Bury's paper opened up an unexpected field for print historians in one direction, that by Martin Kemp did the same in another. His subject was the interest in maps and mapping which was in vogue among the princes in sixteenth-century Italy, and is seen both in painting - in the corridors of frescoes of maps in, for example, the Palazzo Vecchio and the Vatican - and in their liking for superb scientific instruments connected with mapping. A number of those that he illustrated (in particular by Baldassare Lanci) are decorated with splendid examples of engraving, here used as decorative elements without any function in printing. These are thought to have been engraved by Northern artists rather than Italians; but either way, the field is of real significance and has been grossly neglected. One fascinating speculation was that the studio of Poliamolo also produced engraved astrolabes : see, for example, the figure of Prospettiva on the tomb of Sixtus IV. Clearly, if we are to include maps in our general picture of Renaissance printmaking, we have to reconsider their purpose. We shall not be able to grasp this if we see them purely in twentieth-century terms. Their function, in other words, was not limited only to revealing relations and dis- tances between places, or the shape of a coastline. They were also a vehicle for conveying much more general infor- mation about the terrain, peoples and manners of different localities. The bits that filled up the gaps were also import- ant, as were the vignettes that filled the margins. This links them directly with series of costume prints, topographical views and exotic animals ; and the same interests brought in the same engravers and publishers, antony Griffiths LIEVEN CRUYL. Cruyl remains a shadowy figure. Born in Ghent c. 1640, he was ordained a priest in an abortive first career. About 1664 he turned up in Rome, having somewhere acquired a considerable expertise in topographical drawing. This he turned to good use in the set of ten etchings, plus title-page, that he made for the publisher Giovanni Battista de' Rossi: Prospectus locorum Urbis Romae insignium , 1666. A group of 2 1 of the drawings for these prints formed part of the Albertina collection before World War I, but since they were in the section deemed to be the private possession of the Habsburg family were later sold, and are now divided between the Cleve- land Museum (which has eighteen) and the Rijksmuseum (which has three) . The loan of the Cleveland drawings in 1989 to the Accademia Americana in Rome occasioned the publica- tion of a catalogue, Vedute Romane di Lieven Cruyl , paesaggio urbano sotto Alessandro VIL This includes an introductory essay by Barbara Jatta and reproductions of all eighteen drawings. Five in fact are preparatory to the 1666 set, but it is clear that the others were also intended for engraving, as they are all drawn in reverse. Why the second part of the series was never published is a mystery. Cruyl sub- sequently etched a view of Rome, but most of his later work took the form of series of drawings that were clearly intended as end-products in their own right. In the 1680s</page><page sequence="3">NOTES 63 he went to Versailles, where he made drawings for Louis XIV. In the catalogue's second essay, Joseph Connors discusses the rivalry of the two de' Rossi cousins. While Giovanni Battista, in the Piazza Navona, published Cruyl, around the corner at S. Maria della Pace Giovanni Giacomo sponsored Giovanni Battista Falda. Despite the fact that Cruyl's views are in many respects better than Falda's, it was the latter's prints that did best - a tribute, it seems, to Giovanni Giacomo's superior marketing abilities. REMBRANDT IN NORWICH. Norwich Castle Museum's fine collection of Rembrandt prints was signalled to readers of Print Quarterly by Richard Godfrey's notice (December 1987). An exhibition of the collection was held from 3 November to 2 December 1990, accompanied by a handlist which scrupulously and quaintly records Percy Moore Turner's and Harold Wright's assessment of the comparative merits of impres- sions in Cambridge, Oxford and London (the listing of those collections is unfortunately incomplete) . FRANCIS PLACE - THE HOSPITALFIELD COL- LECTION. The remnants of the collection of prints and drawings of the virtuoso Francis Place are housed at Hospitalfield House, Arbroath, Scotland, having passed by descent through Place's daughter Ann Parrott to Elizabeth Parrott, mother of Patrick Allan Fraser, the mid-nineteenth-century creator of Hospitalfield and of the Hospitalfield Foundation. Despite sales by the Trustees in 1 93 1 and 1954 of many important drawings by Place and his master, Wenceslaus Hollar, significant works survive in Scotland. The exhibition Francis Place , 1647-1728: A Changing Vision of Nature (leaflet by William Payne, 40 pence), mounted with the support of Presentation Prod- ucts Limited at Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum from 29 August to 13 October 1990, presented a selection of them. The prime purpose of the show was to reveal some recently discovered drawings by Place. Also on display was his only known oil painting, a Self-portrait , a group of his etchings and mezzotints, and prints, still in their albums, from his own collection. The exhibition also drew attention to the existence of two previously unknown mid- eighteenth-century manuscript catalogues, respectively of the prints and of the drawings in Place's collection. These were drawn up by his son-in-law, Wadham Wyndham, who married Frances Place in about 1 736. William Payne, Director of The Hospitalfield Trust, used the manuscript catalogue to reattribute the mezzotint of Thomas Comber from George Lumley to Francis Place and, in addition, to assign an etching of Culross to him. Further study of these manuscript catalogues will undoubtedly lead to revision of Hake's catalogue of Place's prints and will build on Richard Tyler's research published in the 1971 York City Art Gallery exhibition catalogue. The relationship of Place's own works to the etchings that he owned by Perelle, Silvestre, della Bella and others deserves further explora- tion. It is to be hoped that a larger exhibition will be eventually mounted of the Hospitalfield Collection together with a fuller publication, martin hopkinson ZANETTI' S TRICKS ON MARIETTE. The close friendship in Paris of the Venetian collector Antonio Maria Zanetti the Elder (1679-1767) and Pierre-Jean Mariette (1694-1 774) has been well documented since the publication of the second volume of Bottari's Raccolta di lettere sulla pittura , scultura ed architettura , Milan 1822. This friendship extended to Zanetti and Mariette playing art- historical jokes on one another. Bartsch (xii, p. 191) records an impression of Zanetti's Vision of St Helen in the collection of Count Fries, which carried the monogram of Andreani and the date 1602. On the verso was a long inscription by Mariette : This piece was engraved by Zanetti. It has the mark of Andreani and the date 1602, but this was a joke of Zanetti. He made it with the intention of deceiving me, but he did not succeed. He wanted to have me believe that I lacked this piece, and sent me this damaged impression to make me think that it was an old proof. I replied to him on the spot that I was not the man to be taken in. Tricks of this kind were among the many things held against Zanetti by John Baptist Jackson. In An Enquiry into the Origin of Printing in Europe , London 1 752, p. 39, a similar story is told : At this first interview the low cunning of his man was discovered; he (Jackson) desired him (Zanetti) to intrust a drawing in his hands for a few days; accord- ingly he let him have an original of Parmegiano for four blocks, which was a Venus sitting on cushions, holding up a bow for a cupid to grasp at [Kainen 2, dated 1 73 1]. This print was done entirely in Hugo's manner, with this difference, that no oscuro block has a contour to resemble the original drawing it was done from, which is seldom seen in Hugo's works, the other three blocks are simple, without any regard to the use of splitting tints, since discovered, and only practised hitherto by the first inventor of that sort of printing [that is Jackson himself]. These blocks I (the anonymous narrator) have seen at Battersea, as also an impression of a curious print cut with lines from a drawing of the same author, which is the half length of a woman holding a vase on her head [Kainen 3] . These two prints were cut to shew Zanetti, there was a man come from England to undeceive him of his being the restaurati of what never was lost. It appears that this author was highly surprized at the first proof of the Venus, and intended to send it to his friend Mariette in Paris, to impose it on him for an original print of Hugo's, and dawb'd and cut holes in it to look worm-eaten for that purpose. ANTONY GRIFFITHS A PUBLISHER OF ILLUSTRATED BOOKS: FRANCIS DU ROVERAY. In the years 1798 to 1806 the London discount broker, Francis Isaac Du Roveray (1772-1849), son of a Huguenot immigrant, published a series of illustrated classics, such as Milton in 1802 ; for these</page><page sequence="4">64 NOTES he commissioned his illustrations, of which 92 were executed by seven leading Royal Academicians, including Henry Fuseli. Very little information has hitherto been readily available about Du Roveray beyond the fact that he alienated the English engravers of the time by threaten- ing to give work to French engravers, a move which struck the former as both insulting and unpatriotic. The gaps in our knowledge have now been ably filled by the joint efforts of the distinguished Blake scholar, G. E. Bentley Jr of the University of Toronto, and D. H. Weinglass of the University of Missouri-Kansas City, editor of The Col- lected English Letters of Henry Fuseli , Millwood, N.Y., 1982. They have published a series of four valuable articles, the result of detailed research over several years, in the Biblio- graphical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , xii, 1988 (issued 1990) entitled 'F. I. Du Roveray: Illustrated- Book Publisher 1798-1806'. Professor Weinglass con- tributes the first essay, 'The Life of a Huguenot Publisher and Connoisseur in London', and Professor Bentley 'The Amateur and the Trade', 'Du Roveray's Artists and Engravers and the Engravers' Strike' and 'A Bibliography of his Publications'. DAVID ALEXANDER ENGLISH SATIRES OF THE FRENCH REVOLU- TION 1789-1802. M. Pascal Dupuy of the University of Rouen is currently working on this topic. He would be grateful to hear from any curators or collectors who have prints which are not in the British Museum or the Library of Congress. He plans to visit the United States in 1991. His current address is 113 New King's Road, London SW6 4SJ. FATAL CONSEQUENCES. Fatal Consequences: Callot, Goya and the Horrors of War was published by the Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, on the occasion of the exhibition held from 8 September to 9 December 1990. The contribution of Reva Wolf on Goya is predictably sure and authoritative, and it is intelligently matched by Hilliard Goldfarb's essay on Callot. The exhibition prints, fine but by no means exceptional, come from the collection of Adolph Weil Jr. EMMA'S ATTITUDES. To honour the retirement in 1 990 of Eleanor Garvey as Philip Hofer Curator of Print- ing and Graphic Arts at the Houghton Library, Harvard University, the Library has published a booklet, Emma Hamilton's Attitudes by Frederick Rehberg. This reproduces the title-page and the twelve plates of Drawings Faithfully copied from Nature at Naples . . . dedicated to . . . Sir William Hamilton ... by .. . Frederick Rehberg, 1 794, which show some of the 'attitudes', generally inspired by Classical literature, with which Emma Hamilton entertained her husband's visitors. This has a short but perceptive introduction by Richard Wendorf, the Librarian, which sketches in the historical and cultural background of this phenomenon. Unfortu- nately, what the different attitudes represent is not revealed. Moreover, readers of Print Quarterly will be disap- pointed to learn that no information is given about the publishing history of the volume of plates, which was engraved by Thomas Piroli. Professor Wendorf writes that 'it is likely that Frederick Rehberg's publication of 1794 was commissioned by Sir William', but he gives no further details. It would have been of interest to have been given some idea of the circulation of the volume, which is pre- sumably the source of the large stipple copies made in London by G. T. Stubbs at the end of the decade, david ALEXANDER FRENCH CENSORSHIP. On pp. 330-31 of our issue for September 1990, Tom Gretton reviewed a monograph by Robert Justin Goldstein entitled Political Censorship of the Arts and the Press in Nineteenth-Century Europe , published by Macmillan in 1 989. When we then received for review a paperback by the same author published in 1 989 by Kent State University Press with the title Censorship of Political Caricature in Nineteenth-Century France (isbn 0-87338-396-6), our immediate thought was that this was an American edition of the same book published with a slightly different title. But further inspection revealed our mistake: there are indeed two books on very similar themes published by the indefatigable Professor Goldstein in the same year. The structure of the latter work is straightforward. After two introductory sections on the mechanics of censorship and the defensive strategems devised by caricaturists, come four long chapters that follow in chronological sequence the history of the subject from the Revolution of 1 789 right up to the First World War. To some extent it answers one of the criticisms expressed by Tom Gretton about the first book, in that it does provide some sort of systematic outline of the legal systems involved in France as well as the devices adopted to thwart them. As such it will undoubtedly be useful to future students. But its use is severely restricted by Goldstein's frequent use of secondary and often suspi- cious sources, and by his infuriating habit of clustering all his references in one footnote at the end of a paragraph so that it is almost impossible to determine the source of a particular piece of information. Another weakness - at least for the earlier part of the story - is Goldstein's appar- ent unfamiliarity with the single-sheet print. The cata- logues of the de Vinck and Hennin collections in the Cabinet des Estampes of the Bibliothèque Nationale are never referred to. On the other hand, he shows an enviable knowledge of the later caricature periodicals housed in the printed book section of that institution. The story Goldstein tells is remarkable in the extreme. He rightly puts at the head of his book the fact that whereas for much of the nineteenth century in France there was no censorship of the written press, censorship of the image - all images, not just caricatures - nevertheless remained in force. The picture was feared as being more powerful than the word. This compels us to look at the French cari- caturists with renewed respect. Goldstein's illustrations, despite the murky quality of reproduction, provide con- vincing evidence of their brilliance, and he touchingly dedicates his book to André Gill, whose magnificent work remains almost unknown to the world of prints because it is buried in journals. The opposite is true with the towering figure of</page><page sequence="5">NOTES 65 Daumier, through whom we all know La Caricature and its struggle against Louis-Philippe between 1830 and 1835. But there is a bizarre paradox here. It was because Louis- Philippe's regime was liberal in its instincts that it abolished censorship of the image in its early days, retain- ing only the right to prosecute for libel. Its reward was to be so brilliantly assaulted by not only Daumier but by a host of other caricaturists of genius as well - especially Grandville, who is quite as excellent as Daumier - that their picture still completely distorts the commonly received understanding of the nature of the July Monarchy (and even Goldstein is not immune to this). The regime of Charles X, which was incomparably more vicious and repressive, remains virtually unknown to the public. The fact that even the Republican regime after 1870 retained preventive censorship of images until 1 88 1 is perhaps the greatest tribute that those in power could possibly have awarded these caricaturists, antony Griffiths. NINETEENTH CENTURY PRINTMAKING. Under the title Druckgraphik im ig Jahrhundert : Techniken, Aufgaben , Möglichkeiten , the Staatliche Graphische Samm- lung in Munich has published a small 52-page catalogue of an exhibition held in 1990. The 100 prints included cover a wide range of countries, styles and techniques. The catalogue entries are brief, but the compiler, Edgar Baumgartl, has provided an introductory essay which surveys the course of nineteenth-century printmaking. As the exhibition title suggests, its emphasis is on the period's technical developments. PRINTS AFTER BURNE-JONES. The Reproductive Engravings after Sir Edward Coley Burne- Jones, published by Julian Hartnoll, 14 Mason's Yard, Duke Street, London SWi, 61 pp., 22 b. &amp; w. ills., London 1988, £28 hb, is a study of the nineteen singly-issued prints after the dreamy and enigmatic pictures of Edward Burne-Jones published between 1882 and 1900. These prints are quite unlike the usual reproductive prints of the period, for instead of being black and hard engravings, heavy with all the noticeable tricks of the engraver's art, most are characterized by a sensitive and soft tonality which is in keeping with the original paintings. This is no accident. As Christopher Newell brings out in his essay on 'Burne- Jones and his Printmakers', the etchings owe their excep- tional quality to the attention of the painter himself, who took great pains to see that his pictures were engraved in an appropriate way (fig. 39). The only English engraver whose work satisfied him was Charles William Campbell, who made only one print, the mezzotint of Pan and Psyche , 39. Eugene Gaugean after Burne-Jones, Fiamma Vestalis , 1887, etching, 425 x152 mm (Photo courtesy of Julian Hartnoll).</page><page sequence="6">66 NOTES issued in 1887, the year of his early death. Instead, Burne- Jones turned to Continental engravers. The Polish-born Felix-Stanislas Jasinski came to Burne-Jones's attention and by 1900, two years after the painter's death, he had engraved five pictures in his meticulous and laborious way. Unlike some painters, Burne-Jones was not prejudiced against photogravure, and the five photogravures of his paintings - including four of the Briar Rose series - are included here. All nineteen prints are excellently reprodu- ced, albeit on a rather small scale. There are useful notes on the pictures by John Christian, followed by a catalogue of the prints by Julian Hartnoll, who is to be congratulated on a beautifully produced publication, one which would undoubtably have pleased Burne-Jones himself, david ALEXANDER AMERICAN ETCHINGS. Despite the considerable amount of attention that has been paid to American prints of the first half of this century, and despite the great amount of attention that has been paid to the European etching revival of the second half of the nineteenth century, very little attention has been paid to the American etching revival. In American Painter Etchings , 1853-1008, the excel- lent small catalogue of an exhibition held at the Grolier Club in New York in 1989, Rona Schneider surveys this unfamiliar territory. She has come up with a sufficient haul of interesting surprises to show that further investigation would repay the effort. The best, as one might expect, seem to be by the Morans. But the exhibition itself must have been stolen by one print which falls right outside the revival's aesthetic. It is by one Adalbert Johann Volek (also known as V. Biada), and shows Abraham Lincoln signing the proclamation of the emancipation of the slaves, urged on by a wonderful assortment of devils and death's- heads lurking as decorative details on the furniture in his study. Published in 1863, it was re-issued in 1880 as part of a set of 29 Confederate War Etchings. WHISTLER AT THE HUNTERIAN. James McNeil Whistler at the Hunterian Art Gallery : An Illustrated Guide is a lavishly illustrated introduction and selection of high- lights from the riches of the Hunterian' s Whistler collec- tion. A more specialized, though more modest, publication is the complementary Whistler in Europe , the catalogue to the evidently splendid exhibition of that title held at the Hunterian from 6 October 1990 to 26 January 1991. In tandem the two publications represent a considerable con- tribution to Glasgow's year (1990) as European City of Culture. The quality of presentation and standard of scholarship owes much to the local talents of Martin Hop- kinson, Margaret MacDonald and Nigel Thorp. KÄTHE KOLLWITZ. The two great collections of Kollwitz's prints are in Dresden and Berlin. The latter group is now divided between the West and East, although this may turn out to have been only a temporary separa- tion. No such hopeful outcome is in sight, however, for the Dresden collection. Die Kollwitz-Sammlung der Dresdner Kupferstich- Kabinettes is a handsome hardback book pub- lished to accompany an exhibition at the newly-opened Kollwitz Museum in Cologne at the beginning of 1989. The exhibition, rather incredibly, contained the entire surviving Dresden collection, and all the prints and draw- ings are beautifully reproduced, mostly full-page, in the catalogue, in which the list of the 1 20 exhibited works is followed by a further list of the 75 items that went missing at the end of World War II. Ten of these were drawings, and for that reason they also appear in the volume edited by Christian Dittrich, Vermisste Zähnungen des Kupferstich- Kabinettes Dresden , 1987. The introduction to the 1989 catalogue contains an essay on 4 Max Lehrs und Käthe Kollwitz: die Entstehung der Kollwitz-Sammlung des Dresdner Kupfers tich-Kabinettes' by Werner Schmidt, the long-serving head of the Dresden print room, who has been recently promoted to run all the Dresden collections. Lehrs is still an influential presence in print scholarship as a result of his extraordinary corpus of early German engraving (published in nine volumes between 1908 and 1 934) most of which was written while Lehrs held a full- time job. This essay gives many useful details about his career. Born in 1855, Lehrs joined the Dresden print room in 1883 and remained there until his retirement in 1923, except for one short spell, 1905-08, when he was head of the Berlin print room. Why he left Berlin to return to his old job in Dresden is not revealed, but a cryptic remark suggests that he had fallen out with Bode. Those who only know Lehrs as an historian of early engraving will be astonished to learn from Schmidt's essay what a champion he was of contemporary work, and in particular that of Kollwitz. While a modern print curator (unlike a painting curator) is expected to be interested in both the old masters and contemporary work, few would go as far as Lehrs and purchase (or manoeuvre the gift of) hundreds of examples of the work of their chosen artists. Needless to say it was also Lehrs who laid the basis for the Berlin Kollwitz collection. He also maintained a cor- respondence with the artist, and Schmidt gives extracts from this in his essay. One amusing aspect of Lehrs's deal- ings with contemporary artists that finds no place here is his brush with Emil Nolde, a story worth retelling. In early 1907 Nolde sent unsolicited packages of his prints on approval to a number of German print rooms, among them Berlin. All were returned with short notes of rejec- tion. Nolde, who was always somewhat paranoid, then sent Lehrs the following letter, which he later printed in a selection of letters published in 1927, long before Lehrs's death in 1939: Dear Sir : It is well-known among artists that you direct your particular enthusiasm to the technically pure and temperamentally and apparently artistically empty English etchings, and that under your direction the print room in Dresden was filled with these prints and that the same thing is now happening in Berlin. People say that art which is really full of life and which looks to the future completely escapes your perception. That this is deeply resented and censured by German artists is understandable. You have also rejected my things, but this is not the reason that I address myself to you - I</page><page sequence="7">NOTES 67 do it in the general interest. I am writing the truth to you quite frankly since I like to say the truth, and since I gladly put my efforts behind the real pulsating art of our day. With my deepest respect, Emil Nolde, Painter. This vicious letter illustrates the potential perils of dealing with some contemporary artists. Lehrs, to his credit, fought back. Nolde included (doubtless without permission) a few choice extracts from Lehrs's letter of reply in his auto- biography: he saw in Nolde's Childish scribbles only a caricature of nature. They are so shamefully awful that I would never dare to lay them before my expert commit- tee which is composed of artists'. Perhaps when more has been published, we will be able to decide for ourselves just how blind Lehrs was to the art of his own day. But this book puts beyond doubt his admiration for Kollwitz, of whose work he published the first catalogue as early as 1903, in the same way as the plates reveal again what a magnificent draughtsman she was. The exhibition of her work now being planned for Washington is something to which we can look forward, antony Griffiths MAREES GESELLSCHAFT. The portfolios pub- lished in Germany by the Marées Gesellschaft between the last years of World War I and the Great Depression of the 1930s have often forced their way to the attention of print historians. This is partly because some of them con- tained original prints: the best-known example is Beck- mann^ Gesichter , which appeared as the thirteenth publication in 191 9. But these were the exceptions. The majority were collections of reproductions, mostly of draw- ings and watercolours, made using the process of collotype and printed in the main by the firm of Ganymed Graphis- che Anstalt in Berlin. The editor of the series was Julius Meier-Graefe, while the publisher was Reinhard Piper of Munich. These reproductions have long been famous - as well as notorious - for their quality. So good in fact are they that prints from them are frequently thought by dealers and auctioneers to be originals. And if the publisher's blindstamp has been cut off at the bottom, they can indeed be very deceptive. One help in these perplexities which has so far been lacking is a complete listing of all the port- folios, with a description of their contents. Fortunately, Ann Baer, a former director of the English publisher Ganymed Press, London, has taken on the task of filling this gap, and her findings will in due course be made avail- able. Many of the portfolios are now extremely scarce, however, and to enable this work to be completed she needs to find copies of eight which have so far eluded her : No. 4. Daumier Drawings , 1918. 15 facsimiles with an intro- duction by W. Hausenstein. No. 15. Vincent van Gogh , Watercolours and Drawings , 1919. Introduced by Oskar Hagen. No. 16. Deutsche Skizzenmappe (80 nineteenth-century Ger- man drawings), 191 9. Introduced by H. Uhde-Bernays. No. 37. Pieter Bruegel the Elder , Watercolours and Drawings , 1922. 14 facsimiles with an introduction by Kurt Pfister. No. 42. Die Kunst der Gegenwart (modern watercolours and drawings), 1923. 42 facsimiles with an introduction by J. Meier-Graefe. No. 43. Claude Lorrain (drawings from the Berlin Kupfer- stichkabinett and the British Museum), 1925. 12 facsimiles introduced by Kurt Gerstenberg. No. 45. Gauguin, Noa-Noa. 12 facsimiles. No. 47. Renoir , Watercolours , Drawings and Pastels , 1929. 16 facsimiles with an introduction by J. Meier-Graefe. A number of the portfolios were also issued in English and French versions, some of which included introductions by art experts in these countries. The portfolios appeared in England and France under the imprints of their respective agents. Some libraries may have them indexed under the names of the agents and not under that of Marées. The agents for England were Constable &amp; Co., 10 Orange Street, London, and The Independent Gallery, 7 Grafton Street, London; in France they were Ganymède Publica- tions d'Art, and Georges Crés et Cie, both in Paris. If anyone can help, could they please write to Mrs Ann Baer, care of the Print Room at the British Museum. MICHAEL ROTHENSTEIN. The association between Michael Rothenstein and Birmingham City Art Gallery has been cemented by the presentation to the Museum of an archive of his prints made between 1950 and 1990. To mark the event an exhibition of 46 prints was held at the Art Gallery from 27 October to 16 December 1990. The catalogue, written by Tessa Sidey, includes an informative and interesting essay on Rothenstein's printmaking, and carefully compiled entries for the exhibition prints ; it is handsomely illustrated. BOOK ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SIX CENTURIES. Book Illustrations from Six Centuries in the Library of the Sterling &amp; Francine Clark Institute , Williamstown, Massachusetts, was published to coincide with an exhibition held at the Institute from 28 July to 23 September 1990. An essay documenting Robert Sterling Clark's activities as a book collector (he purchased approximately 3,000 books between 1916 and 1954 from just two firms - Drake and Quaritch) is followed by detailed catalogue entries and illustrations of 42 books dating from the fifteenth to the twentieth centuries. There are many beautiful books in this catalogue, but nothing beyond a pleasurable browse to stimulate the print scholar. GARDENS IN PRINTS AND DRAWINGS. A recent exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. ( i April - 22 July 1990) was accompanied by an illus- trated catalogue: Virginia Tuttle Clayton, Gardens on Paper: Prints and Drawings , 12 oo-igoo , with over 120 illustrations, of which 28 are in colour. The five chapters trace the theme of the garden as it developed in Western art from the 'Middle Ages' (here, with one exception, exclusively fifteenth-century examples) through to the nineteenth century. Prints, either separate sheets or book illustrations, account for the better part of the illustrations, especially for the early periods, with drawings and water- colours appearing more often in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century discussions.</page><page sequence="8">68 NOTES The catalogue presents chronologically a series of images that include gardens. Given the obvious limits of the evidence, these range from the fanciful to the documen- tary - from wattle fences in representations of the Passion or engraved patterns of leaf ornament, to detailed, bird's- eye views of actual eighteenth-century gardens and sug- gestive explorations of colour and form in nineteenth- century watercolours. This general survey of garden illustration is set against the backdrop of changing social and artistic conventions, with some remarks on the techni- cal evolution of prints. Unfortunately, the quality of the illustrations is not adequate to support any substantive dis- cussion of topographical details or graphic techniques. Although specific references to quality of line, tonal con- trasts and the like are occasionally made, the visual evi- dence is frustratingly unhelpful as illustration. The blown- up 'details' that accompany most chapters as frontispiece and endpiece are uniformly fuzzy and intended merely as decoration. This is lamentable, since the text does encourage the reader to look closely at some of the images, and it would have been welcome to find legibly printed details chosen to support the written commentary rather than added by the designer solely for effect. Of the 106 pieces in the exhibition all but eight are from the National Gallery of Art's own collection. This may be the cause of a certain imbalance in geographical emphasis, the focus switching from Germany in the 'Middle Ages' (21 examples out of a total of 26) to France in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (27 out of a total of 39, with no examples from Germany or the Netherlands). The text does not seek to provide an original perspective, but it does offer a clearly written, copiously documented, if conven- tional overview of the subject, linda b. parshall THE SCHWARTZ COLLECTION. Under the mis- leading title of Master Prints of Five Centuries : The Alan and Marianne Schwartz Collection , the Detroit Institute of Arts has published a handsome catalogue to accompany an exhibition it held in 1990. The Schwartzes have been handsome donors to the Institute, and the print exhibition galleries have been named in their honour. The collection remains, however, in the Schwartzes' personal possession. They have contributed a two-page statement, 'On Collect- ing Prints', to the catalogue, which will be appreciated by students of the history of print collecting. Their collection of prints was begun, apparently, in 1972, but took a serious turn in 1976. It now comprises about 200 items. At the outset we determined that the focus of the collec- tion would be broad. The collection would be comprised of prints of the Western world from the fifteenth century into the first half of the twentieth. We resolved to acquire the very best works of not only well-recognised artists, but also those of lesser renown endowed with extraordi- nary talent. Our criteria require the quality of the impression to be exceptional and the condition of the paper to be nearly perfect. It is our preference that the subject of the images depict affirmative visions of human potential. . . . We have constructed a 'wish list' of prints to be acquired that reflects our personal judgement of quality, significance, and lasting appeal. The list is a liv- ing document that is continually revisited and fre- quently amended. It is indeed true that the Schwartzes have exercised their own judgement; and a number of the prints in their collec- tion would set few auctioneers' hearts racing. But the reason that the catalogue title is misleading is that the col- lection cannot claim to be a representation of five centuries of printmaking, except in the most token of ways. It is in fact a good collection of American prints of the first half of the twentieth century, which includes a large number of major items (among them Hopper's American Landscape , which has my vote for the greatest of all American prints), a few interesting surprises (Arnold Rönnebeck) and some aberrations (Artzybasheff, Barker, Weidenaar, as well as no less than three prints by the dreadful Rockwell Kent) . There are 128 American prints; the remaining 80 items cover the rest of the world, sometimes in a curious way. The four prints that represent Britain, for example, are Bone, Brockhurst (no prizes for guessing which one), Cameron and Gainsborough. The total number of prints that pre-date 1830 is fourteen. Although this probably accurately reflects the proportion of Old Master to modern prints in the average American auction or dealer cata- logue, Europeans can only wince at the suggestion that this fairly represents the history of the medium or that it properly reflects the relative aesthetic importance of the images, antony Griffiths A COLLECTION OF MEDICAL SATIRES. Some 40 years ago Agnes Lothian Short, the Librarian of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, began to collect medical satires on behalf of the Society. By the time of her retirement in 1967 she had acquired most of the collection of 1 71 prints which has now been catalogued by Kate Arnold-Forster and Nigel Tallis in The Bruising Apothecary: Images of Pharmacy and Medicine in Caricature , London 1989, 84 pp.. 50 b. &amp; w. and 8 col. ills, (available from the Pharmaceuti- cal Press, i Lambeth High Street, London SEi 7JN, £9.50 incl. UK postage ; addresses of overseas distributors avail- able on request). A six-page introduction outlines the development of pharmacy and of caricature. The cata- logue of the collection, which is predominantly of English prints made between 1 750 and 1850 but with a few draw- ings and French prints, is grouped in seven themes: por- traits of occupations and individuals, diseases and their treatment, advertisements and proprietaries, concepts and emotions, political and social subjects, anthropomorphism and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. The items are all carefully catalogued with useful commentaries, but unfor- tunately only a third are illustrated, and inevitably the choice of illustration favours several of the better-known images. The disadvantage of a thematic arrangement is that it is difficult for the reader to gain an idea of the development of the medical profession, a topic on which satires throw a good deal of light, as medical historians now realize. A chronological treatment would have been helpful to those with only a sketchy knowledge of the subject. However,</page><page sequence="9">NOTES 69 this catalogue will undoubtedly stimulate interest in the subject, and the Society must be thanked for producing it. There is a useful bibliography which lists a good many publications from the United States, where the Ars Medica collection in the Philadelphia Museum of Art has been a particular spur to study of the subject. Several recent works on medical history are also listed, a field to which the British historian Roy Porter has contributed a number of fascinating books and articles in recent years, david ALEXANDER RAILWAY POSTERS. The National Railway Museum, Leeman Road, York, which is part of Britain's National Museum of Science and Industry, has a collection of some 5,000 railway posters. This is still growing: last year, for example, the archive of Tom Purvis (1888-1959) was acquired at auction. A recent booklet, Happy as a Sand Boy , compiled by Richard Durack and Beverly Cole, London, HMSO, 1990, £7.95, contains colour illustrations of 48 posters produced between the 1890s and the 1920s. This span ends too early for some of the most famous and effec- tive posters, but the selection shows the transition from posters produced with a minimum of professional design to those produced by such well-known artists as Fred Taylor. The booklet has an interesting 24-page text and short bibliography and is a useful introduction to the topic, but at this price the purchaser might expect rather more, and the publication falls a little awkwardly between being a picture book and a more serious study. DAVID ALEXANDER I VINS. Few authors have written as provocatively about the concept of the print in Western culture as did William I vins in his book Prints and Visual Communication (London 1953). An important analysis and critique of Ivins's philosophical and historical position has recently been published by Gordon Fyfe, 'Art and its objects: William I vins and the reproduction of art', in Picturing Power : Visual Depiction and Social Relations , edited by G. Fyfe and John Law, London/New York (Routledge) 1988, PP. 65-98. A TECHNICAL DICTIONARY. On page 64 of our issue for March 1990, we noted the publication of the first volume - A to L - of Luis Nadeau's Encyclopedia of Printing, Photographic and Photomechanical Processes. Volume two - M to Z - has now appeared (1990, priced at $38), and will be as useful to print historians as the first. There are several appendices. One lists German technical terms, with their English equivalents ; another consists of common technical terms and abbreviations used on or about prints. There is also an index of personal names as well as a general index to both volumes. MACHIDA CITY MUSEUM. One of the more unusual catalogues of prints to have been published recently is from the Machida City Museum of Graphic Arts near Tokyo in Japan (title and text in Japanese, 1990). The introduction (for a summary of which I am grateful to Tim Clark at the British Museum) explains that the Museum established a purchase fund in June 1983, and has so far collected about 10,000 prints. Of these some 3,300 are European or American from the late fifteenth century to the present. The remainder presumably are mostly Japanese, and the Museum's intention is to con- tinue to build up a representative collection of world graphic art. This volume contains short catalogue entries and selected small reproductions of what seems to be only a selection of the European and American section of the collection. For those who have, like me, assumed that Japanese interest in Western prints has not yet strayed far beyond Dürer, Rembrandt and Munch, this catalogue will be a surprise. There are only four Dürers (though one item is a complete Little Passion ), four Rembrandts and one Munch. The catalogue is divided into three roughly equal sections: the first, of masters up to 1800, has 235 numbers, the second, of the nineteenth century, has 142 numbers, while the last part of the twentieth century has 1 74 entries. Many in each section are for volumes or collections, and thus the total number of prints is far greater than these figures. The reproductions are far too small for me to be able to say anything about the quality of impressions, and the collection (or selection) is perhaps too small to draw any conclusions about the responsible curator's taste. But there are certainly a number of surprises which one would not expect to see in many Western collections. There is a com- plete set of the extraordinary Gautier-Dagoty colour prints of the human anatomy, and a wide selection of ornament prints. Most impressive is the range of genres covered (from portraits to reproductive prints and festival plates) and the catholicism of interest (which includes some anonymous fifteenth-century German woodcuts). It is perhaps only in the modern collection that the dangers of modishness have been less successfully avoided. If it carries on collecting in his way for another decade, the Museum will certainly be able to claim that it can offer the Japanese public a conspectus of the range of Western printmaking. antony Griffiths GEORGE BUDAY - THOMAS BEWICK. Following the death in June this year of the artist, historian and wood engraver Gyorgy Buday, several items of his printing equipment, many galleys of type matter and some printed material have been given to the Thomas Bewick Birthplace Museum at Cherry burn in Northumberland. George Buday (1907-90) worked for many years at the Netherne Hospital in Surrey, where he had small studio and printing office in the grounds. Famous as a wood engraver, he was also known for his collection of Christmas cards, some of which are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Selected prints have gone to the British Museum (in particular an example of the first Cole-Horsley Christ- mas Card of 1843), some printed material to the Ephemera Society and the majority of his woodblocks have been returned to his native Hungary. Several woodblocks, how- ever, were locked up with type matter in chases and these</page><page sequence="10">70 NOTES 40. David Alfaro Siqueiros, Nude , 1930, lithograph, 42 1 x 575 mm (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art). are now at Cherryburn. It is intended to use his equipment in the permanent typographic display and demonstration section of the museum and to make a permanent archive of the small amount of printed matter which we were able to retrieve. Because of the many gaps in his tiny archive the museum's printer and researcher would be very grate- ful to hear from anyone with information on prints by George Buday.

David Alfaro Siqueiros's lithograph, Reclining Nude , or Nude, 1 930, exists in no less than three editions or versions (figs. 40, 41 and 43). The authors have inspected them, and their observa- tions are presented in this short note, as are photographs of the images and details showing the signatures. Readers are asked to answer such questions as : Which is the orig- inal? Why were three versions made? Are the signatures authentic? The authors have found only one reference to the print in the literature of the period. Carl Zigrosser, in 'Mexican Graphic Art', The Print Collector's Quarterly , xxin, April 1936, illustrates the print over the title Nude Reclining , gives the dimensions as 16 x 22^", with the nude's head to the left. Zigrosser makes no reference to Nude Reclining in the article except in the list of Siqueiros's prints. In 1936 Zigrosser was director of Weyhe Gallery, which had pub- lished prints by the Mexican los tres grandes, Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros. The first print (fig. 40) is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to which it was given in 1 93 1 by Jean Chariot; it is titled Nude on the mat. The second (fig. 43) is in the collection of the authors. Number and signature are along the right edge (figs. 44 and 45). At least two other impressions of this version, with the signature in the same location, have been up for sale in New York in the past year. The third print (figs. 41 and 42) is also in the collection of the authors; its dimensions are smaller, dave and reba Williams</page><page sequence="11">NOTES 71 4 1 .

Possibly the least lavishly- produced but most interesting catalogue recently pub- lished by a dealer is that entitled Hayez litografo , edited by Mattia Iona for La Portantina, his gallery in Milan. It is devoted to the ten years - the third decade of the nine- teenth century - during which the painter Francesco Hayez produced among the best lithographs made in Northern Italy at the time. Thirty works are included in this word-processed catalogue, but none is illustrated : this is particularly disappointing since there are two undes- cribed prints among the items for sale, and also a preparatory drawing for one of Hayez's etchings of 1817. Another catalogue dedicated exclusively to an artist is Judith Pillsbury's Auguste Lepère , which comprises 86 num- bers : these include a representative group of his wood engravings and etchings, some of his most famous chiaroscuro woodcuts, a copy of La Forêt de Fontainebleau - a book illustrated with 34 wood engravings - and, finally, four among his less well-known lithographs. With its 45 good illustrations, this catalogue will be a useful addition to the bibliography of the artist. A similar, albeit much thinner, enterprise is Lumley Cazaleťs well-printed flyer devoted to Albert Belleroche, and which illustrates 38 of the 400 lithographs he recorded in his log-book. As yet there is no catalogue of his work, a fate he shares with the American John J. A. Murphy, nine of whose impressive woodcuts are illustrated in a catalogue produced by Sylvan Cole in New York. The short essay on the artist by Jan Johnson and the first published checklist of his work, comprising 1 63 numbers, add further value to this small booklet. The rediscovery of Murphy's prints is balanced by the appearance of another publication on the monoprints by a well-known artist, Naum Gabo. He rarely editioned his sculpture, and applied the same principle to his prints, only producing variants of twelve images, now combined in a set of small portfolios by Waddington Graphics. The beautifully produced catalogue is intro- duced by an essay by Graham Williams, the author of a monograph on the artist's monoprints published in 1987. On the occasion of the publication of seven new etchings by Frank Auerbach and of a monograph on him by Robert Hughes, Marlborough Graphics devoted an exhibition to his œuvre as a printmaker and accompanied it with a hand- some catalogue. This will update Michael Podro's article on the artist, published in this Journal in December 1985. Prints of Philadelphia is devoted to a single topic as well but, as the title suggests, of a different kind. Published by the Philadelphia Print Shop, it describes the collection put together over 30 years by Dr and Mrs Milton Wohl : this consists of as many as 286 images in some way related to the city, whether maps, plans, views or caricatures of its citizens. It is a pity to see such a collection being dispersed, but we are consoled with a good catalogue that will become a work of reference for the subject. A number of impressive general catalogues full of masterpieces have recently seen the light, and it is difficult to single out a few: Artemis's Master Prints and Drawings includes a spectacular Censer by Schongauer, coming from the British Rail Pension Fund sale, and an undescribed proof on yellow paper for Kirchner's Artilleristenbad. Rumbler's catalogue of Singulaere Werke der Altemeister- graphik is packed with interesting prints, all in seemingly fine impressions: among the more familiar examples by Dürer, Callot, Rembrandt and Piranesi, an impressive number of unusual names appear, including Pierre Scalberge, Girolamo Scarsello, Hans Weiner and Gabriel Zehender. Olimpia Theodoli's Master Prints concentrates on better-known figures, albeit in apparently less glamorous impressions, but includes one of the four pear- wood blocks for John Baptist Jackson's The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine - that carrying the lightest colour - to be printed first. R. S.Johnson's catalogue of the A. L. De Sanc- tis Collection not only deserves mention for its group of exceptional Manets, but because the proceeds from the sales will 'eventually provide academic scholarships for Hamilton College'. Another institutional connection is that between Boerner and the Museum der bildenden Künste in Leipzig, where the Düsseldorf firm organized an exhibition of major prints and drawings accompanied by a 263-page catalogue, a statement of the sensational range and quality for which this firm has been known for more than a century. Major prints by all the great names of the history of printmaking have been put together for this event, the print world's own celebration of a reunited Germany. The catalogue is lavishly illustrated, and the entries shot through with the scholarship we have become accustomed to find in Boerner's publications. Notwithstanding the impressive competition, the accolade for the best catalogue of the season undoubtedly goes to La Sirène, Paris, for their catalogue Ornaments, Architecture. This was written in collaboration with Peter Fuhring, a scholar who has often contributed to this Journal, and whose erudition in the field of ornament prints and drawings is unrivalled. He has used the oppor- tunity offered him by M. Cotlenko to the full, producing a catalogue that will become a must for the print-lover's library: 372 pages (unpaginated), 1,434 numbers in alphabetical order by artist (whether engraver or designer), 124 very small and not very good illustrations, and as much information in each entry as one would be happy to find in any museum exhibition catalogue. Indices of names and subjects are followed by a bibliography. While one must congratulate La Sirène for having put so much effort into this catalogue, it is deeply to be regretted that such a sizeable and coherent collection of prints has been dispersed, one that must have take decades to put together, and which would have been so useful if kept together, david landau</page></plain_text>
