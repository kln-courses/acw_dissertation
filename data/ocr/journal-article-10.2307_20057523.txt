<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poetry and Permeability Thomas M. Greene I A discussion of human permeability might usefully begin with its delimitations in archaic legend. Plutarch, in his "Life of Romulus," has an evocative description of the preparations for the construction of Rome. Romulus ... set to building his city; and sent for men out of Tuscany, who directed him by sacred usages and written rules in all the ceremonies to be observed, as in a religious rite. First, they dug a round trench about that which is now the Comitium, or Court of Assembly. . . . This trench they call, as they do the heavens, Mundus; making which their centre, they described the city in a circle round it. Then the founder fitted to a plough a brazen ploughshare, and, yoking together a bull and a cow, drove himself a deep line or furrow round the bounds; while the business of those that followed after was to see that whatever earth was thrown up should be turned all inwards towards the city; and not to let any clod lie outside.1 The ritual separation of what would be enclosed from what would be excluded required the kind of punctilious attention embodied by those following the plough to move all the upturned earth within the furrow. The walls that would ensure the security of the future city were indeed sacred because its survival depended on their strength, and because the founding of a city traditionally reenacted the original creation of the cosmos, whose center this place now becomes. The Comitium at the center of the city was itself surrounded by a trench called "cosmos," Mundus, and the trench is to the outer walls as they are to the rest of the circular world. Just how sacred was the boundary around the future city had already been indicated in Plutarch's text by a famous incident immediately preceding the passage just quoted. Romulus's brother Remus, angered by a stratagem whereby his twin had won the right to build his city, could not resist a scornful and sacrilegious gesture which cost him his life: "When Remus knew the cheat, he was much displeased; and as Romulus was casting up a ditch, where he designed the foundation of the city-wall, New Literary History, 1999, 30: 75-91</page><page sequence="2">76 NEW LITERARY HISTORY he turned some pieces of the work to ridicule, and obstructed others; at last, as he was in contempt leaping over it, some say Romulus himself struck him, others, Celer, one of this companions; he fell, however" (30). To leap over the ditch was to disregard the taboo that protects a ritual work, and was apparently perceived to justify fratricide. The killing of Remus stands at the beginning of Roman history as a symbol of the sacrosanct character of the communal enclosure. But another feature of this legend more pertinent to the theme of permeability is the distinction made between walls and gates: "With this line they described the wall, and called it, by a contraction, Pomoerium, that is postmurum, after or beside the wall; and where they designed to make a gate, there they took out the share, carried the plough over, and left a space; for which reason they consider the whole wall as holy, except where the gates are; for had they adjudged them also sacred, they could not, without offence to religion, have given free ingress and egress for the necessaries of human life, some of which are in themselves unclean" (31). If the walls are sacred, their openings are profane and dangerous, since these permit a commerce inwards and outwards of those poten tially unclean things humans need and produce in order to survive. Passage in both directions is essential, but is reduced by walls that confine passage to delimited spaces. The city, any preindustrial city, needs to make itself capable of access, but not too capable. It has to keep its integrity as a specific locus with a name, but to endure it needs modifications to its integrity in the form of openings to the hinterland. When all access is choked off by a siege, the gates lose their function and the city is threatened by extinction. But if there were no walls to enclose and exclude, the city would be helpless against military attack. Modern cities show us how their unwalled integrity is also vulnerable to the straggling ambiguities of outlying sub urbs drifting away from the once-holy center to be swallowed up in a megalopolis. The loss of integrity, along with the entrance of pollution, have to be balanced against the loss of nourishment, and in Plutarch's myth of establishment it is the former risks that appear to weigh more heavily. What emerges from the myth as a whole might be regarded as the need of every city for its own determinate economy of access, a ratio of exclusion and reception, an urban hygiene which has to be regulated carefully to maintain civic health. The economy of the urban macrostructure is imitated of course by the microstructure of the single dwelling, since in it also the protection of walls has to be interrupted to permit passage. The threshold of a house is its riskiest place; it used to be guarded by defensive or apotropaic images; a bride must be carried over it to ensure that she not stumble and provoke nefarious influences. It is through the door of a house that</page><page sequence="3">POETRY AND PERMEABILITY 77 contagion enters to threaten the occupants and spreads outward to threaten the community. The domestic counterpart of a military siege would be that grim ordinance described in Defoe's Journal of the Plague Year, whereby houses known to contain infected persons were locked up and guarded by a watcher appointed by the civic authorities. The ambivalence of the gate which a city needs to survive but which threatens to befoul it is matched by the ambivalence of a door, which focuses the risky drama of passage in two directions. This drama can be likened in turn to that of the living structure termed by Anglo-Saxon poets the banhus, the bone-house, the human body, which includes the psyche. For this organic house to survive, a boundary is necessary between the outer and inner worlds, the Umwelt and the Innenwelt; a barrier must be felt to separate the individual self and the non-self, even if some modern thinkers have questioned the actual existence of that supposed selfhood. Some demarcation nonethe less has to be drawn if the subject is to remain sane. The sacred protectivity of city walls is matched by the precious boundary protecting the individual. The personal equivalent of the collapsing city wall would be the splintering of the psyche. But this analogy must not be pressed to the limit, since waking human beings cannot easily close the gates through which impressions, vivid or vapid, pour into them. If the loss of a personal boundary is a terrible threat, so is that state of mind that would deny admission to the reality about it. The psyche must also possess, to remain sane, a capability of receiving and processing a stream of impressions from without, lest it yield to the threat of solipsism and ultimately schizophrenia. This is never easy, since at least some of the impressions we receive will be unclean, like the matter passing through the gates of Rome. It is always possible that this matter ingested by consciousness will be contagious, most clearly in the form of poisonous attitudes or ideas, and these contagious impressions in turn threaten to infect the speech and actions we project outward. A literary critic who questions the existence of a self, J. Hillis Miller, sees an incipient madness underlying the delusive belief in an integral self, a madness stemming from the na?ve literalization of the metaphors inherent in words like "character" and "person." This "myth of the subject" can lead, according to Miller, to dangerous private and political confusion. But to surrender this myth would be even more dangerous: "To live without the illusion of selfhood, to feel one's selfhood doubled, tripled, dissolved, as though by demonic possession, as Kierkegaard described it, to live in the nakedness of truth, were such a thing possible, would be another kind of madness."2 Kierkegaard's description, quoted by Miller, is indeed frightening: "Can you think of anything more frightful than that it might end with your nature being resolved into a</page><page sequence="4">78 NEW LITERARY HISTORY multiplicity, that you really might become many, become, like those unhappy demoniacs, a legion, and you thus would have lost the inmost and holiest thing of all in a man, the unifying power of personality?"3 Miller in fact believes in this multiplicity, but thinks that its common acceptance would lead to catastrophe. He fails however to demonstrate his belief, which in fact may not lend itself to proof. What remains is a "suspicion" (his word) of a simple unified self with its concomitant fear of division. "To be human," writes Miller about the double threat of division and allegedly delusory unity, "is to live precariously balanced between madness and madness, between extremes both extremely dangerous" (34). Whether or not Miller is right, whether or not this balance between integrity and multiplicity is and has been everywhere precarious, one can agree that some sort of balance must be struck by all men and women. The extreme of multiplicity as sketched here might be said to involve a radically unbalanced economy of access, in which a hypertrophy of external solicitations prevents their psychic processing. But the extreme of living, or trying to live, according to a deceptively unified self would pose the threat of a rigidity so obsessive that too few solicitations could be acknowledged. Against this binary post-Freudian nightmare one can set an opposing threat to human selfhood that is both ancient and early modern: not a multiple selfhood in this case but a vacant selfhood, a perpetual solution of continuity that constitutes a kind of insubstantial wispiness. This alternative pathology of access is nowhere more power fully formulated than in the closing pages of Montaigne's "Apology for Raymond Sebond," copied more or less directly from Jacques Amyot's Plutarch (here the moralist rather than the biographer) : "How can we each be one if we love or hate contradictory things, first praising them, then condemning them? How can we have different emotions, no longer retaining the same sentiment within the same thought? For it is not likely that we can experience different reactions unless we ourselves have changed; but whoever suffers change is no longer the same one: he no longer is. For his being, as such, changes when his being one changes, as each personality ever succeeds another."4 Montaigne's critique of the single self, following Plutarch, is bolstered by an account of the serial deaths each individual encounters as childhood dies into youth, youth into ripeness, and ripeness into senility. The boundary between self and non-self collapses for him because the entity within the boundary is inconstant to the point of vacuity. It is true that elsewhere Montaigne moderates the radicality of the critique he found in his favorite ancient authority. In a passage from the short essay "On Democritus and Heraclitus," Montaigne seems to be adumbrating the circular processing of external impressions when he</page><page sequence="5">POETRY AND PERMEABILITY 79 praises the soul for its ability to deal with them according to its own will: "Things external to her may have their own weight and dimension: but . . . inside us she gives them such measures as she wills. . . . Health, consciousness, authority, knowledge, beauty and their opposites doff their garments as they enter the soul and receive new vestments, coloured with qualities of her own choosing: brown or green; light or dark; bitter or sweet, deep or shallow, as it pleases each of the individual souls. . . . Each soul is Queen in her own state" (338). The order of the string of adjectives reverses what the conventional reader might expect: the more comprehensible categories such as deep or shallow follow the more obscure and arbitrary; what would be brown or green inside the soul? But the colors point more precisely to the inimitable and irrational tincture things acquire from the individual consciousness as it exercises its characteristic and recognizable power of assimilation. Montaigne's wonderful humanist paean to this power qualifies his Plutarchan denial of the autonomous and continuous self, and it offers a way of under standing our struggle to achieve one. Following Montaigne here, one might conclude that the economy of access in human beings differs from that of cities in a fundamental way: the strength of the integrative forces in the psyche actually depends on the quality of one's commerce with a given context. Whereas in Plutarch's legend the protection of the walls and the necessity for passage were perceived as antinomies, the one sacred and the other unclean, one can only draw an analogy with humans if this antinomy is understood to collapse into interdependence. The integrative forces in the psyche are reinforced by certain kinds of commerce with the outer world, a commerce offering an enduring source of continuous conduct within a capacity for progressive growth. That capacity is reflected most powerfully in three kinds of experience: in the performance of nourish ing work, in a responsive love relationship, or in the act of joining others in play with delight and self-forgetfulness. Our human openings to the non-self are problematic because what I have called the processing of impressions does not occur after we receive them, but rather depends on a preexisting taxonomy of percep tion which we project on the world. That taxonomy derives largely from the network of language which organizes the world according to its own distinctions, but it also derives from our idiolects, our private myths, values, habits, and intentions. The reception of the impression is inseparable from the organizational assumptions projected upon it, so that the passage into the Innenwelt is always accompanied by a largely unconscious passage out to the Umwelt. Confronted with an amorphous chaos of phenomena, I isolate some part of it by extending to it a name, and by means of the name, or metaphor, or some other trope, I am able</page><page sequence="6">80 NEW LITERARY HISTORY to relate to it, to "take it in," to assimilate what has now become a distinct and knowable thing. The use of words allows us to isolate, apprehend, and define an otherwise indeterminate object and thus to recognize it, humanize it, and receive it. My act of naming is indistinguishable from my assimilation; together they constitute a simultaneous circle.5 "An object that has received a name," writes Northrop Frye, "is more real by virtue of it than an object without one."6 In the habitual private character of this repeated circular activity triggered by the name, this double passage as it is individualized throughout a lifetime, surely lies much of Kierkegaard's "unifying power of personality." The organizing, shaping force of a common language is partially, gradually supplanted by the shaping of the idiolect, which ideally allows each subject to order and understand and respond by using words as anthropomorphic projections.7 Because words have the peculiar property of passing from our minds and bodies to the outer world, they help to establish the boundary between the internal and the external, but they also reveal the boundary's permeability; they moderate its absolute enclosure and exclusion. The vigor and responsiveness of our inner lives, ultimately the creativity of our lives in the world, depend on the subtiety and precision and distinction of our double commerce with our given contexts. This ideal of course is vulnerable to any number of pathologies, beginning with the twinned risks of self-dispersal and solipsism, too little integrity and too reclusive an integrity. If onomastic power makes us human, it also renders us capable of deception and self-deception. Language filters as it realizes, and the filtering is always subject to perspective and desire. We are inevitably subject to Bacon's idols (eidola, phantasms) of the marketplace, names that refer to nonentities or skewed entities.8 Some human subjects are placed in situations which exceed their processing powers, causing the invasion of the alien to be experienced as a rape; such persons are obliged to rigidity the psychic barrier against the external world, so that the economy of access in their lives becomes permanently deranged. Oliver Sacks describes one autistic patient as lacking the capacity to internalize impressions in ways that nourish him: "Though he might retain everything he saw, in a sense, it was retained as something external, unintegrated, never built on, connected, revised, never influencing or influenced by anything else. ... I found myself thinking of him as a sort of train . . . , a perceptual missile, traveling through life, noting, recording, but never appropriat ing, a sort of transmitter of all that rushed past?but himself unchanged, unfed, by the experience."9 Sacks's word "appropriating" is the crucial one here, corresponding to my "assimilating"; it fails in this case because the autistic mind is unable to "name." To private pathologies like this</page><page sequence="7">POETRY AND PERMEABILITY 81 one can be added the social and cultural pathologies of an oppressive or malnourishing community. The vulnerable coherence that we try to maintain as distinctive persons seems to depend on our control of pathology, on our creative habits of projection and reception as we respond to particular environments, physical, social, and intellectual, none of them pristine, all of them to some degree "unclean." That imperfect coherence also depends on our memories of experi encing this double passage outward and inward throughout our past lives, memories that are always fallible, partial, and porous. Memory, which is a fabrication, is nevertheless a bulwark of the centripetal cohesion that preserves us from Kierkegaard's multiplicity. Memory is a tattered, deceiving, manipulative faculty; it is repressive and mytho maniacal; but for all its cheats and partialities, it does provide us with the most essential thing, a patchwork narrative that allows us to claim an identity. If the amnesiac does not know who he is, when he recovers his memory he learns his "identity" again and can function as that aggregate of past experience he has happily recovered. His selfhood coheres around an incomplete and inaccurate story which is still sufficiendy firm to individuate him as a distinct person. But for him to work productively, to love responsively, to play with gaiety, that self-defining firmness has to fall short of neurotic rigidity. Neurosis is that stiffened distortion of memory that fixes one's attention on too little, perceived too narrowly and painfully. Neurosis is a distraction from the creative circle of projection and assimilation. Thus if we need some minimal degree of rigidity to function as more or less coherent subjects, our functioning begins to be paralyzed if that rigidity exceeds a maximal ceiling. Pathological memory blocks the potential creative commerce between incipient self and world; it shuts down the play of denomination and reception; it minimizes that permeability which constitutes our peculiarly human economy of access. Rigidity can be regarded as the paradoxical symptom of a self that is dangerously threatened by division. The trait of a self capable of moving toward self-integration would then be a flexibility that reflects continuity rather than alternation, a flexibility moderating any tendency to shift roles abruptly. The more or less integrated self would be able to turn from work to play to love while remaining recognizably the same. Thus the human economy of access is distinguished by an economy of regulated alteration. The rigidity required of archaic city walls has to give way in persons to a changeful continuity in order to avoid disintegration. The soul tinctures things brown or green as it wills, but the tincturing is characteristic of something not incoherent, something recognizably enduring and unique.</page><page sequence="8">82 NEW LITERARY HISTORY II Could it be said that human beings ever undergo a kind of occlusion analogous to the siege of a city or the closure of a plague-infested house, where no passage between inside and outside is possible? I cite a story from the record of a gifted teacher's work with a handicapped adolescent. During the latter eighteenth century a certain Abb? Sicard taught a deaf-mute shepherd boy named Jean Massieu how to communicate through written words and gestural signs. Before his learning began, Jean had been regarded as a brute rather than a human, and had been treated as such by his family. After the successful completion of his course, the abb? wrote a book about Jean's education, and although the bulk of it is devoted to a proud and detailed account of his pedagogic method, the abb? did record briefly the responses of his fourteen-year old pupil at successive stages of his education. A crucial moment occurred when the boy discovered the link between word and object. It produced intense excitement, anticipating the euphoria of Helen Keller at a similar moment. The abb? records that Jean became "hungry" for names. When the two took walks together, the pupil repeatedly de manded to know the word for everything he saw: "We visited an orchard to name all the fruits. We went into a woods to distinguish the oak from the elm . . . the willow from the poplar, eventually all the other inhabitants. . . . He didn't have enough tablets and pencils for all the names with which I filled his dictionary, and his soul seemed to expand and grow with these innumerable denominations. . . . Massieu's visits were those of a landowner [propri?taire] seeing his rich domain for the first time."10 The teacher records his impression that learning words changed fundamentally his pupil's relation to the world: "this newcomer to earth was a stranger on his own estates, which were being restored to him as he learned their names." In the eyes of the Abb? Sicard, his pupil had become a human being. We would say he had discovered semiosis. A twentieth-century account of the same experience attributes to it a still more physical internalization of the world. Oliver Sacks cites a letter from a woman who taught an illiterate and deaf Mexican, Ildefonso, the system of gestural signs. "The real breakthrough," writes Sacks, "oc curred on the sixth day, after hundreds and thousands of repetitions of words, in particular of the sign for 'cat.' This moment of understanding was intensely exciting." The moment led, according to Sacks, to an "intellectual explosion" revealing "the sense and meaning of the world." Sacks goes on to quote a letter from Ildefonso 's teacher, Susan Schaller, describing the explosive moment: "'His face stretches and opens with excitement . . . slowly at first, then hungrily, he sucks in everything, as though he had never seen it before: the door, the bulletin board, chairs,</page><page sequence="9">POETRY AND PERMEABILITY 83 tables, students, the clock, the green blackboard and me. . . . He has entered the universe of humanity, he has discovered the communion of minds. He now knows that he and a cat and the table have names.' Schaller compares Ildefonso 's 'cat' with Helen Keller's 'water'?the first word, the first sign, that leads to all others, that opens the imprisoned mind and intelligence" (56). The first sign is so welcome because it opens "the universe of humanity." This onomastic moment, joined as it is with the experience of opening, involves an experience of assimila tion, not only an explosion but an implosion as the world is violendy sucked into the self. Jean Massieu's soul-expanding act of taking posses sion, as related and metaphorized by the Abb? Sicard, is intensified in Schaller's account as a quasi-physiological introjection. In fact, each metaphor calls for the other; the projective act of the new and hungry propri?taire imples the introjective act that devours. Both Massieu and Ildefonso are liberated from what Helen Keller called a "death-in-life existence, . . . the desolation of [a] prison-house."11 These three stories serve to dramatize the role of signs, and above all of verbal signs, in the regulation of our human economies of access. Without the sign, the subject fails to be fully human, fails to project names, metaphors, myths, and distinctions upon a world that remains amorphous and remote. Jean Massieu was unable to work at anything but a brutish level; he was unable to love and to play until he discovered semiosis, which liberated him to begin a personal commerce with the world and with himself. It was the sign that made him free. Before he understood the sign, he resembled the moribund city cut off by a siege; his selfhood lacked nourishment; the barrier between inside and outside was pathologically dense. Afterwards, he acquired a kind of power and ownership. There seems to be no reason to minimize his teacher's metaphors. Having noticed this, however, one has to measure adequately the potentially negative implications in these two cases. Each of them involves the element of hunger, and if the special circumstances explain the ravenous character of this semiotic appetite, they need not obscure the gnawing sensation of existential lack that seems to afflict even those who are comfortable with words and signs, even those who are nour ished by work, love, and play. Perhaps we are justified in extrapolating from these two extreme instances a hunger for plentitude that is universal in the human condition. It seems to be characteristic of our economies of access that the nourishment entering our personal gates will always seem inadequate. It was Plato's Diotima who said that the mother of Love was Penia, need, lack (Symposium, 203b-e), a presence that has never abandoned Western culture. What Plato meant by this allegory is not altogether clear, but I take it that Penia has something to</page><page sequence="10">84 NEW LITERARY HISTORY do with the paucity of our sources of joy. She turns up again in the Fifth Book of Rabelais, which has the priestess Bacbuc, distorting a fable of Aesop, tell her visitors that "all humans are born with a wallet around their neck, needy by nature and begging from one another."12 Giovanni Pontano, the Quattrocento poet and humanist, had already written that "poverty (inopia) is given to men as a companion at their birth" and that language (sermo) is given to men to remedy this poverty. Jean-Paul Sartre saw indigence (la raret?) as the permanent condition of human experience.13 The theme recurs frequendy in the work of Emily Dickinson, a great poet of poverty. I never lost as much but twice, And that was in the sod. Twice have I stood a beggar Before the door of God! Angels?twice descending Reimbursed my store? Burglar! Banker?Father! I am poor once more!14 Here the twice-repeated experience of bereavement is caught up in a category of impoverishment that appears in the third instance undefined and that remains primordial, basic, and vast. The Banker who sends his angels to restore the speaker's losses is also the Burglar who will rob her again, so that the appeal for restoration in the last line simultaneously takes on the accent of accusation. No assurance is visible that an angel will again descend, or, should that occur, that further appeals to the Burglar-Banker will not be necessary once again in the future. The only mitigation of the inner penury lies really in the capacity for precise articulation of the spiritual need. In Pontano's language, sermo is the only remedy for inopia. So Mallarm? writes about the poetic imagination as always desiring satisfaction in semiosis: "the magisterial effort of the imagination desiring not only to satisfy itself with the symbol gleaming in the world's spectacles, but to establish a bond between them and the word assigned to express them."15 This mitigation was one of the supreme messages of Wallace Stevens. "Poetry," he wrote, "is a purging of the world's poverty and change and evil and death. It is a present perfecting, a satisfaction in the irremedi able poverty of life."16 And in one of his late poems, Stevens wrote of the imagination as "a single shawl / Wrapped tightly round us, since we are poor."17 Stevens recognized the factor of Plato's Penia in human</page><page sequence="11">POETRY AND PERMEABILITY 85 economies of access, and he saw in poetry a solacing factor, as though poetry could accelerate or intensify our commerce with the world in ways that would nourish our pervasive hunger. How precisely could this nourishment be understood to operate? I want to begin to answer this question by asking whether the duality of exclusion and penetration can be extended still further to the verbal sign. Do words have their own economy of access? It was Saussure who stressed the separateness of each word, which in his thought existed by differentiating itself diacritically from all the others in a given language, a langue. Saussure's word is a monad that exists negatively in opposition to other monads. Within the langue, its walls never open. But linguistic thought in our century has also stressed the semantic dependence of each word upon its context in the act of speech, the parole. To be sure, a word has to be felt to possess being in itself, with its own etymology and its range of dialectal variations and its history of broadening or narrow ing a cluster of potential meanings. But to be useful, the word also has to be open enough to bend with the pressure of its verbal and pragmatic surroundings, which could be described as penetrating the substantiality of the word for the purpose of irony or wit or nuance. In common usage, a word has to surrender its strict independence to lend itself to verbal play, and play will always introduce a novelty that challenges a word's stability. Thus the word can be said to possess its own economy of access and its own balance of stability and openness. And since this economy in individual experience is inseparable from the projected taxonomies of language, the simultaneous flow outward and inward of one person's creativity is bound up with the openness and flexibility of his or her linguistic consciousness. Thus one has a right to perceive linguistic openness as a mark?or a contributing cause?of psychic openness. I take it that this is the subject of another poem by Emily Dickinson, whose first quatrain I quote: I dwell in Possibility? A fairer House than Prose? More numerous of Windows? Superior?for Doors? (P 2:506) The opposition of possibility and prose implies a double opposition, both poetry/prose and possibility/routine or even possibility/fate. Dickinson's ostensible illogical opposition implies that the verbal and existential, if not interchangeable, can be situated on a spectrum. The experience of possibility, of choice, and thus of freedom, is bound up with linguistic invention. This invention in turns multiplies the windows</page><page sequence="12">86 NEW LITERARY HISTORY of the self and thus fosters the passage of finer intuitions through the psychic walls, now partially replaced by the more numerous "Windows." To live in such a dwelling then enhances the prospect of an Entrance through a grander door, intensifies the drama of thresholds and initiations. Here Dickinson explicitly thematizes a more generous economy of access that is fearless of contagion. She also confirms proleptically Stevens's vision of poetry as a solace to existential poverty. To dwell in verbal and spiritual possibility is no longer to need a metaphysical Banker. Dickinson's brief lines in fact can be construed to adumbrate a theory of poetry. Poetry by this account would be an art of permeability, eroding the boundary between inside and outside, quickening the flow from and into ourselves. Poetry as incipient speech is the art that passes most fluently through the creator's bodily boundary outward and passes again through the auditor's boundary inward. This intensification and acceleration and refinement of an exchange do not however erode the stability of the self. "/ dwell" writes Dickinson, "in possibility," and this dwelling, with its associations of security and tranquillity, suggests that poetry offers a specific economy of access wherein an enhanced exchange serves to heighten the integrity of the subject. We become more distinct, more individual, more ballasted against the forces of multiplicity, as we participate in the multiplication of windows and the potentialities of entrances that Dickinson serenely celebrates. These potentialities are exemplified by the way Dickinson's poetic language, like all poetic language, operates. To evoke what is ostensibly a "subjective" condition she is obliged to use "objective" images such as doors and windows. There is no other way. Baudelaire's series of "Spleen" poems, apparently addressing a private distress of the spirit, can only call upon analogies from the physical world, and analogies within analogies. The opening of the greatest is characteristic: "Quand le ciel bas et lourd p?se comme un couvercle ..." ["When the low and heavy sky hangs heavy like a lid . . ."].18 But of course a poem that appears to describe only something "objective" like a landscape, with no ostensible auto-reference, always turns out to be about the "subjective" sensibility that names and selects the features chosen for inclusion. Poetry is that discourse in which the distinction between inner and outer collapses. Thus, as with the subject, so with the verbal sign in poetry. Poetic language alters a text's economy of access to quintuple the passage of implication into a given word and to undermine its conventional meanings. The poetic word is always in a danger of losing its stability as it undergoes a kind of transformative violence that turns out to be a</page><page sequence="13">POETRY AND PERMEABILITY 87 benign profanation and that invests the word with a fresh integrity. Poetic language dramatizes the potential richness of a structure where the double movement inward and outward acquires a dizzying virtuosity, a mastery we as readers are invited to impute to a fictive speaker who is never altogether inseparable from the poet. The speaker's display of an intuitive control over the innerness of the "objective" and the objectivity of "inner" experience thus becomes a tutelary display which invites the reader to begin to emulate it. To read a poem is to be unconsciously schooled by an exemplary performance. Other boundaries tend to give way as well within the dynamic play of poetry. It is an art that erodes the supposed semiotic boundary between sound and sense, signifier and signified, since its whole enterprise consists of rendering the sound of words inevitable and of collapsing that Saussurean wall. The poetic signifier drifts toward a closer identifi cation with its signified, but it simultaneously calls attention to its own sonority, its linguistic substance, its partial opacity; it calls attention to its own power as a semiconductor.19 The poetic name dramatizes its own double location, its double status as subjective intuition and external agent, and its very resistance to mechanical understanding multiplies the energy of assimilative apprehension. The poetic name creates what it designates, brings into being an entity never previously known because never precisely isolated by the particular new verbal formulation, and now always beginning to be known. Poetry is a discourse always holding out the hope of absolute semiotic permeability, always attempting to prove that Plato's Cartylus was correct. Poetry is also permeable in another way, tending as it does to assimilate organically motifs and phrases and stances from predecessor texts, finding always new functions and accents in intertextual fluidity. Poetic texts turn out to be instruments of preternatural openings, penetrations, passages, fluencies, and appropriations. But having recog nized this, one is obliged to remember that poetic language characteris tically begins by creating boundaries around itself, setting itself off more or less sharply from ordinary speech, insisting on that one distinction that encloses it against less permeable language. It draws a boundary against boundaries. The paradoxical privacy of the open poetic house is evoked in what immediately follows of Dickinson's poem, whose remainder I now quote. Of Chambers as the Cedars? Impregnable of eye? And for an Everlasting Roof The Gambrels of the Sky?</page><page sequence="14">88 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Of Visiters?the fairest? For Occupation?This? The spreading wide my narrow Hands To gather Paradise? This dwelling, both structure and activity, is "impregnable of eye," protected from vulgar earthly vision, but is open above to the sloped roof, the gambrel, of heaven. The more numerous windows of the first stanza are vehicles of the self-created Possibility/Poetry permitting the dweller to name and rename without limits what the windows reveal, and it is this joyful activity that produces visitors?fantasies, inspirations, muses?and that enables the sublime closing exchange solacing all poverty, that spreading wide of the appropriating hands in a supreme euphoria to take in the ultimate wealth. This hymn to the permeability of the poetic consciousness and its mitigation of existential poverty truly does serve as a formulation of a poetics. The consciousness is not on exhibit, just as its verbal produc tions may resist casual perusal; there is no denial of opacity; the dweller and her work may well finally be "impregnable." But the privacy does not really forbid "Visiters" (sic), and even reaches out by the close to receive the ultimate Visitation. The gathering and receiving of "Paradise" become possible despite the speaker's "narrow hands," a phrase which doubtless alludes on one level to her supposedly limited poetic instru ments. The gathering and receiving are possible precisely because she has chosen to multiply and aggrandize her access to the physical and spiritual world. The poem is in a sense about her, the poetic speaker, but about her as she remains in touch throughout with a kind of reality. The refusal or incapacity of the poetic language to isolate her authorizes the reader's acceptance of the concluding miracle. This apparendy is what poetry does: it breaks down the Saussurean monads of language to reinvent new meanings that flow with unrealistic and dazzling fluency through an impossibly permeable mind. And this flow becomes in turn exemplary for the reader, whose own mind in the act of reading is schooled for a few minutes in the rewards of psychic apertures. The poem can be regarded as a ritual wherein the projection of radically destabilized verbal signs permits the internalization of radically complex signifieds, thus suggesting an ideally permeable consciousness no living person can perpetually imitate but that can serve as an exemplary model. Poetry offers an illustrative economy of access seldom available in daily experience but present as a virtual ideal. Poetic language then intensifies the interchange between a self always struggling for coherence and a context always requiring more definition. Poems are about this interchange. As we have seen, those poems which</page><page sequence="15">POETRY AND PERMEABILITY 89 appear to be purely descriptive always reflect a perceiving sensibility, and those poems which appear to be turned totally inward always draw upon imagery from the "external" world. Poems act out exemplary inter changes even when they problematize the interchange, as they often do. It was this experience of passage between inner and outer worlds which, in one of the Sonnets to Orpheus, Rilke metaphorized as breathing. Atmen, du unsichtbares Gedicht! Immerfort um das eigne Sein rein eingetauschter Weltraum. Gegengewicht, in dem ich mich rhythmisch ereigne. [Breathing, you invisible poem! World-space constantly in pure interchange with our own being. Counterpoise, wherein I rhythmically happen.]20 Rilke understood, before Heidegger's enrichment of the word Ereignis, that the human self gains consistency and substance through a constant, formative experience of exchange, an exchange which at its most dynamic can be described as Orphic. Of course the harshest test of the poem as a ritual of openness is the tragic confrontation with our universal burden of penury, limitation, and loss. In this case the exemplary internalization is triggered by the speaker's adequate naming of a radical negativity, now formulated verbally and released by metaphorical "names" commensurate in power with the impact of the tragic loss. "Burglar! Banker?Father! I am poor once more!" There is no lack of such confrontations from the Queen of Calvary, and in such instances one feels how in them even more than elsewhere the literal verbal reception and assumption of a given context focus and stabilize the textual self. Emily Dickinson's writing might mislead a reader into objecting that poetry as exemplified by hers fails to allow for that passage of unclean things that preoccupied Romulus's Etruscan seers. Poetry sanitizes, it might be said, strains out what is filthy, and in its antiseptic refinement loses our interest. But in fact poetry has never had any difficulty in introducing what is concretely filthy; one of Dickinson's poems is set in a privy. But the more interesting cases arise when the suspect material is ideologically unclean, as we have already noticed it can be. If poetry systematically excluded that, then the critique of antisepsis would carry weight. But against that kind of filth, the gifted poet has one effective weapon which is not exclusionary but purgative: the trope of irony. Irony, or more broadly the control of tone, tinges the naming of the</page><page sequence="16">90 NEW LITERARY HISTORY unclean with subtle power that nullifies its toxicity. This is precisely what happens in the line that juxtaposes three unlike vocatives: "Burglar! Banker?Father!" Irony, with its lucid alertness to moral contagion, keeps the access of a given sensibility open to all of the impure world. Ill The argument above will not settle the quarrel between proponents of multiple selfhood, of integrated selfhood, or of no selfhood. But it attempts to show that some degree of personal continuity is strength ened by an energy of interchange that is self-enhancing, an interchange for which the actions of writing poetry and reading poetry form models. The approach to a sufficiently flexible selfhood, always incomplete and always dependent upon the fallible faculty of memory, may depend in part upon one's personal economy of access, which is to say the mingled subtlety and power one brings to one's interchanges with the world. Persons, insofar as they can righdy be called persons, are not like Romulus's wall because their openings increase their autonomy. But like the wall's, their openings mitigate the experience of dearth. The kind of assimilation exemplified by poetry does not lead to passive, inert, miserly possession, imperialist possession, but rather to an energetic exchange between the receptive consciousness and the newly internal ized quiddity that is coming into being. Conation is the perennial condition of human beings, striving to work and love and play as coherent agents in spite of poverty. The role of poetry, and perhaps of all art, seems to lie in its tutelage of our striving and its assuagement of our need.
