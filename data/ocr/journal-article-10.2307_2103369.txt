<plain_text><page sequence="1">'TO KNOW' AND 'TO UNDERSTAND'* Introduction The purpose of this paper is to offer some evidence for the assertion that within the theoretical attitude toward the world two basic tendencies must be distinguished, the tendency toward knowledge and the tendency toward understanding.' The evidence here offered is limited to the usage made of the terms 'to know' and 'to understand' in everyday English and in the language of the natural sciences and humanities. A few words, may be permitted to put this linguistic analysis into the right perspective. Almost all English and American epistemologists, and many continental ones, concentrate on knowledge, and particularly on knowledge as gained by the natural sciences. This one-sided emphasis on knowledge over and against understanding has regrettable effects both on philosophy as theory of science and on the life of man, and becomes dangerous absurdity if 'to be scientific' is said to mean the same as 'to use the methods developed by the natural sciences.' Such a statement amounts to saying that 'to under- stand' is ipso facto unscientific. On the other hand, those philosophers who have tried to build up a theory of understanding have done so on the basis either of some suspicious metaphysics or some vague psychology. I suggest that a theory of understanding is a desideratum which no theory of knowl- edge can fulfill, and that such a theory of understanding can be developed without any more metaphysical and psychological beauty spots than any sound theory of knowledge possesses. Motivations for the apparently hopeless and outdated attempt to place at the side of the theory of knowledge a theory of understanding are numer- ous. The shortcomings in the methodology of the social and historical sciences need hardly be mentioned. More important is the observation that understanding plays so large a part in our daily life and is yet almost terra incognita in contemporary philosophy. The splendid success of the natural sciences within the increasingly pragmatic climate of our Western culture seems to have blinded us to a different theoretical world-attitude, a world-attitude whose beginnings are visible in the way in which under- standing functions in our common-sense world. Aspects of this attitude *An earlier version of this paper was accepted by the Third Inter-American Congress of Philosophy, Mexico, 1950. I The term 'understanding' is used in this paper simply as the noun of 'to under- stand,' and not as synonym for 'reason' or any particular 'faculty of reason.' 83</page><page sequence="2">84 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH have perhaps been more fully developed in certain oriental cultures, and with the shrinking of our planet to a one-day-round-trip size we are be- coming increasingly aware of our one-sidedness at the same time that the need for understanding becomes more urgent than ever. Finally, there is the paradoxical situation of Naturalism. Naturalism conceives man as part of nature; but the very scientism at the basis of Naturalism has robbed man of the 'feeling' of being part of nature. As long as man under- stood nature he did not know himself as part of it; now that he knows himself as part of nature he no longer understands it. In other words, the naive anthropomorphism of pre-scientific ages has been replaced, in the wake of the natural sciences, by an equally naive physicomorphism, that is, by conceptions modelled on those of physics.2 Both anthropomorphism, which is characteristic of understanding, and physicomorphism which is characteristic of knowledge, are legitimate within limits that have to be established clearly. They become illegitimate when they transcend their indigenous fields. To achieve a proper 'balance of power' by re-establishing the rights of understanding is a goal whose importance for modern man philosophy must not continue to ignore. I 'To Know' and 'To Understand' in Everyday Language In everyday language, 'to know' and 'to understand' are often used interchangeably. They seem to have the same meaning, with divergencies so slight as to be negligible. Yet there are also usages of the two terms in which they cannot replace each other, thus indicating at least some pro- nounced differences of meaning. Furthermore, in translating sentences containing 'to know' or 'to understand' into languages such as French, Italian, or German, two observations can be made. First, these languages contain a variety of terms (such as connattre, savoir, entendre, comprendre; conoscere, sapere, intendere, comprendere; kennen, erkennen, wissen, verstehen, begreifen) for which the English has only 'to know' and 'to understand.' Secondly, notwithstanding the greater variety of terms, these languages permit much less terminological overlapping than does English. If in any language terms referring to the same general area cannot be substituted for each other, or can be substituted for each other only in certain cases, we have evidence of a 'feeling' of those who speak the language for definite differences within this area. It belongs to the tasks of philosophical analysis to make this feeling articulate and to explicate its assumptions. In the case of the terms here selected for analysis, the general area to which they refer is that of theoretical attitudes, as contrasted with practical and emotional 2 Cf. "The Physicomorphic Conception of Man," The Journal of Philosophy, vol. XLVIII, No, 11.</page><page sequence="3">To KNOW AND TO UNDERSTAND 85 attitudes. Whether I say 'I know you' or 'I understand you,' I refer in both cases to a kind of relation between you and me quite different from the kind expressed in sentences like 'I hate you' or 'I love you,' or in sen- tences like 'I push you' or 'I cut your hair.' The area referred to by 'I know you' and 'I understand you' we will call the area of theoretical at- titudes, or, simply, the theoretical area. Our task is to articulate the 'feel-- ing' of differences within this theoretical area that is indicated by the usages of the terms 'to know' and 'to understand' in everyday English. Of course, the mere fact that such distinctions are made by a language is in itself no proof that they are justified in the sense that they reflect an objective difference, just as the fact that a language does not make such distinctions is no proof that they are not justified. This remark shows the limitations of any philosophical analysis based on linguistic usage alone. Attention to common-sense usage of terms can tell us whether or not a language makes distinctions, but can never tell us whether there is any justification for making or not making them. I would say, however, that if many languages do make similar terminological distinctions, as for instance in the case of 'to know' and 'to understand,' there is in this some prima facie evidence for assuming that the distinction is justifiable. Surveying, then, the usages made by everyday English of 'to know' and 'to understand,' we find frequent examples of mutual substitutability, although certain differences in meaning are rarely, if ever, absent on the fringes; but we also find examples in which the substitution of the one for the other would completely change the meaning of the sentence, and we shall begin with an example of the latter kind. (1) I know Mr. Smith and I know the sentence: alea iacta est. In both- expressions 'to know' may have the same meaning, namely that of 'to be acquainted with....' It is indeed a matter of easy verification that 'to be acquainted with' is the basic meaning of 'to know' as used in our every- day language. We now perform a little experiment. We substitute 'to understand' for 'to know' in the two examples. We find that the meaning of the first proposi- tion is completely altered, whereas the meaning of the second proposition may still be the same. Whatever the meaning of 'I understand Mr. Smith' may be (cf. below (3) and (4)), it cannot be translated into 'I am acquainted with him.' On the other hand, the proposition 'I understand the sentence: alea iacta est' may still mean the same as the proposition 'J know the sentence: alea iacta est.' It means the same if, in the original example, 'to know' is used for 'to be acquainted with the meaning of the sentence: alea iacta est.' But 'to know' may have meant something quite different. It may not have meant 'to be acquainted with meaning,' but only 'to be acquainted with</page><page sequence="4">86 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH the words as events.' If 'to know' means 'to be acquainted with words as (token) events'; if 'to know' does not mean 'to be acquainted with the meaning of the words' we cannot substitute 'to understand' for 'to know' without completely altering the meaning of the expression. Only if 'I know the sentence: alea iacta est' means that 'I am acquainted with its meaning,' can I substitute 'to understand' for 'to know.' Our language seems to make a great difference between 'to be acquainted with facts or events' and 'to be acquainted with meanings.' 'To know' can be used in both cases; but 'to understand' can be substituted for it only in the second. 'To be acquainted with meaning' is, of course, not the only meaning of 'to understand.' If I say 'I understand Mr. Smith' I do not intend to say that 'I am acquainted with the meaning of Mr. Smith.' What the other meanings of 'to understand' are, we shall see below. The main results of our substitution experiment are, then, firstly that if 'to know' is used in its basic sense of 'to be acquainted with facts or events' it cannot be replaced by 'to understand.' We have found one mean- ing of 'to know' that 'to understand' can never have. Secondly, our everyday English makes a very definite distinction between 'to know' as 'to be acquainted with facts' and 'to know' as 'to be acquainted with meaning'-whatever the justification for the making of such a dis- tinction may be (cf. (3)). (In other languages the same distinction is made. 'Comprendre,' 'com- prendere,' and 'verstehen' cannot be used for 'being acquainted with facts or events.' Their use is in the direction of 'being acquainted with meaning.' On the other hand, 'connattre,' entendre,' and 'savoir'; 'conoscere,' 'in- tendere,' and 'sapere'; 'kennen' and 'wissen' divide among themselves the basic meaning of 'to know' as 'acquaintance with events.' Yet, like 'to know' they may at times acquire the meaning of 'to understand' as 'ac- quaintance with meaning.') (2) I know this engine and I understand this engine. The two sentences may mean different things, "I know this engine" may simply mean, as in the previous example, "I am acquainted with it." When 'know' has this restricted meaning, "I understand this engine" may mean more: 'I am not only acquainted with it, but I know how it works,' and even "I can handle it." But this is precisely the meaning that "I know this engine" may acquire by way of borrowing from "to understand." "I know this engine" often means not only 'to be acquainted with it,' but also conveys the ad- ditional meaning which the sentence "I understand this engine" expresses; and in this case the twosentences are substitutable for each other, both stating the speaker to be in possession of 'the know-how.' The know-how, in turn, means, in our example, 'to be acquainted with the causal relations' holding between the parts of the engine or, in other words, 'to be acquainted</page><page sequence="5">To KNOW AND TO UNDERSTAND 87 with the functions' that the parts have in the whole, the function here being the producing of certain effects. Hence, 'to know something' and 'to understand something' are substitutable for each other in those cases in which they mean 'to be acquainted with causal relations.' (3) I know Latin and I understand Latin. Here are slight differences of meaning, and the sentences are perhaps not completely substitutable for each other. 'I know Latin' may mean much more than just understanding Latin. It may mean that I have studied it for many years, am quite a scholar at it, and even able to express myself in it; whereas 'I understand Latin' may mean little more than just being able to get at the meaning of Latin sentences. Here, then, the two sentences would refer to different degrees of acquaintanceship, and their substitution for each other would change their meaning. Again, 'I understand Latin' may refer particularly to my being able to get at the meaning of spoken Latin, while 'I know Latin' may refer to my being able to decipher written Latin. Here, the difference in the meaning of the two sentences is not so much one in the degree of acquaintanceship, but rather one in the kind of language symbols I am familiar with, written or spoken symbols. Yet, although these differences in meaning may not always be completely obliterated, they do not prevent us from substituting often the one for the other, in which cases the com- mon meaning of 'to know' and 'to understand' is their reference to our 'being able to get at the meaning' of words and sentences in a certain language. (4) I know this argument and I understand this argument. The two expres- sions may or may not be substitutable for each other. They are not sub. stitutable if 'I know this argument' means nothing but 'to be acquainted with it.' 'To be acquainted with an argument' need not imply that the argument has been understood. If I say that I understand an argument I mean to say that I am acquainted with the logical relationship holding between a certain conclusion and its premises. But this is what 'I know this argument' may also mean; and if it does so 'I know this argument' and 'I understand this argument' are substitutable for each other. Hence, 'to know' and 'to understand' are substitutable for each other if they mean "to be acquainted with the logical relation holding between a conclusion and its premises." I As in the previous cases, it would seem that 'to know' becomes substi- tutable for 'to understand,' and 'to understand' for 'to know;' if 'to know' borrows, so to speak, from the richer meaning of 'to understand'; and not the other way around: linguistic usage does not permit a mutual substitu- tion by levelling down 'to understand' to the poorer meaning of 'to know.' (5) I know yodu and I understand you. Obviously, the difference in mean- ing of these two phrases can be considerable. 'I know you' may mean</page><page sequence="6">88 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH nothing but my being acquainted with you, whereas, 'I understand you' means (either that I get at the meaning of what you are saying, which has been discussed before and can be ignored now or) that I am acquainted with the motivations of your actions. However, 'I know you' may mean the same as 'I understand you.' It may borrow from 'I understand you' the meaning of 'being acquainted with the motivations of your actions.' For instance, if Joan, whose easily given promises never kept are an old experi- ence of mine, pledges herself never again, never, never, to ffirt with my best friend, I shall exclaim: "Oh, Joan, I know you!" and 'to know' will mean here much more than being acquainted with a person by the name of Joan and remembering that I have met her before. It will mean even more than being acquainted, on the basis of previous experience, or gossip, with certain characteristics of that person. It will indeed mean that I know what makes Joan "tick"; that I am acquainted with the 'motiva- tions that make her behave as she does,-in short, it will have the same meaning that I can express by stating that 'I understand Joan.' And I can understand and know her better than she does herself if I am acquainted not only with the motivations she alleges to have had for her behavior, but with the motivations of which she herself is quite unaware. From all this it follows that 'to know' and 'to understand' are substitutable when they mean 'acquaintance with purposes, motivations' or, traditionally speaking, 'final causes.' (6) However, there is an area of overtones in the usage of 'I understand you' which 'I know you' can never reach. As it is this fringe of overtones which can make it impossible to use 'I know you' for 'I understand you,' it may indicate-and it does so indicate, I submit-a second basic differ- ence between the two terms, the first one being the unsubstitutability of 'to understand' for 'to know' when 'to know' is used as 'acquaintance with facts or events' (cf. , 1). Besides the already mentioned meanings of 'acquaintance with the meaning of what you say' and 'acquaintance with the motivations that make you act as you do,' the phrase 'I understand you' can mean that 'I can put myself in your place,'"I can identify myself with you.' For example, a man accused of the murder of his wife may be understandable to me not only in the sense that I am acquainted with the motivations for his action, but in the more 'dynamic' sense of my being able to see myself in his place or, less metaphorically speaking, in the sense of seeing his actuality as my possibility. In this sense, 'to understand' means a kind of identification of him who understands with the understood. It must be stressed that 'identification' does not at all imply evaluation. 'I understand you,' in the sense of my being able to put myself in your place, need not mean 'I approve (or disapprove) of you and your action.'</page><page sequence="7">To KNOW AND TO UNDERSTAND. 89 Whether I approve or disapprove of the murderer and his action I can, or cannot, identify myself with him. Nor does it imply any particular emotive relation between me and you. It is true that loving you or hating you can help me understand you, but they can as easily do the opposite; and often my loving you or hating you is only the effect, and not the cause, of my understanding you. Of course, there are some 'world attitudes' within the framework- of which understanding as identification can more easily develop than in others; but this is true, too, even of the most rigorous meaning that 'to know' can have in the language of the sciences. A certain general attitude toward the world forms undoubtedly a 'psychological' climate in which scientific research can most easily flourish; yet nobody in his senses would therefore call scientific knowledge 'emotive.' There is, then, no reason to consider understanding as identification emotive just because it, too, grows more easily in a certain psychological climate. Hence, understanding, in this sense of identification, of seeing your actuality as my possibility, is in itself as unemotive and nonevaluative as any of the other meanings that 'to know' and 'to understand' may have. Our survey of 'to know' and 'to understand' in everyday language ends, then, with a note similar to that with which it began. 'To understand' cannot be substituted, so we saw at the beginning, for 'to know' so long as 'to know' means merely the same as 'to be acquainted with facts or events.' We have found now that 'to know' cannot be substituted for 'to understand' if 'to understand' is used in the sense of making a foreign actuality my own possibility. 'To understand' cannot be levelled down to mean acquaintance with facts or events; and 'to know' cannot be raised to mean identification. On the other hand, 'to know' and 'to understand' are substitutable if they mean (a) acquaintance with meanings; (b) ac- quaintance with causal relations; (c) acquaintance with final relations; and (d) acquaintance with logical relations. Finally, we found that every- day language puts the emphasis on 'to understand,' and that 'to know' has to borrow from the meanings of 'to understand' in order to transcend its basic meaning which limits it to 'acquaintance with facts or events' and to become a substitute for 'to understand.' (Etymological investigations as well as a comparison with other languages would undoubtedly throw further light, from a historical angle, on the basic meanings of 'to know' and 'to understand.' Neither of these tasks will be undertaken within the framework of this paper.) II 'To Know' and 'To Understand' in the Sciences We will now survey the meanings of 'to know' and 'to understand' as used by the sciences. This second part of our survey can be shorter than</page><page sequence="8">90 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH the first for two reasons. First, the theory of knowledge has established definite meanings at least for 'to know.' Secondly, the ambiguities of 'to understand' as used in the social and historical sciences seem not to be very different from those that we distinguished in everyday language. To begin with the natural sciences, the basic meaning of 'to know,' namely 'to be acquainted with facts or events,' remains unchanged except for a sharper limitation of what kind of acquaintance is admissible as evidence. However, 'to know' as 'acquaintance with a teleological nexus' is no longer acceptable. Of the three meanings that 'to know' borrows in everyday language from 'to understand,' acquaintance with a teleological nexus was the first one to be eliminated by the natural sciences as anthropo- morphic. Bacon takes it already as a matter of course that "final causes ... have relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe." On the other hand, 'to know' as acquaintance with causal rela- tions prevailed for centuries and is still a familiar meaning in those of the natural sciences which have not reached yet the stage of mathematical theory. Insofar as 'to be acquainted with causal relations' is one of the meanings of 'to understand,' we cannot be surprised to find here the only remaining possibility of substituting 'to know' and 'to understand' on the scientific level. However, even this possibility is in principle already elimi- nated. In the mathematized natural sciences, causality is replaced by functional equations; the most diluted, but also most obstinate residue of anthropomorphism is discarded; and 'to know' no longer means acquaint- ance with causal relations, but rather something much more complicated, linguistically at least. It means the confirmation (or verification) of such propositions concerning the behavior of physical objects as have been deduced from hypotheses expressed as functional equations. We 'know' a certain region of phenomena if our predictions concerning events in this field are confirmed or verified by observation, the prediction itself being deduced from functional equations. In no sense of the term 'to understand' can we say that in thus 'knowing' a field of phenomena we have 'understood' it. Since all natural sciences tend ultimately toward a mathematical theory, and since in such a theory the meaning of 'to know' as acquaintance with causal relations is replaced by 'confirmation of a mathematico-deductive proposition,' even the last remainder of a mutual substitutability of 'to know' and 'to -understand' disappears. Paradoxically speaking, the more scientifically we know nature the less do we understand it. Scientific knowl- edge, ideally speaking, is acquaintance neither with a teleological nexus nor with a causal nexus, a logical nexus between events being a contradictio in adjecto. None of these three meanings of 'to understand' is substitutable for 'to know' in its ideally scientific use. It need hardly be mentioned that the one meaning of 'to understand' which we found already on the level</page><page sequence="9">To KNOW AND TO UNDERSTAND 91 of everyday language quite unsubstitutable by 'to know,' the meaning of 'identification,' has nothing whatever in common with the meaning of 'to know' as employed by the natural sciences. Of course, there is one usage of 'to understand' that is quite legitimate in the sciences, but what is 'understood' is not nature-itself, but the theories about nature. If I under- stand the theory of relativity, for example, I mean to say that I can follow the logical steps leading from the premises to the conclusion; but the theory of relativity itself, while it gives us knowledge, cannot claim to understand, in any meaning of the term, the events of which it is a theory. We will now throw a short glance at the social and historical sciences to discover in what ways they make use of the terms 'to know' and 'to under- stand.' I select history since it is one of the humanities least deflected from its course by the influence of the natural sciences. 'To know' means undoubtedly again 'acquaintance with facts or events'; but we notice at once, an important difference. The acquaintance with his- torical facts or events is not the result of an observation. They have passed; only documents remain. Should we then say that knowledge in history means acquaintance with documents? Surely not, if acquaintance means sense perception or observation. No perception or observation of documents will be of any use in getting acquainted with a historical fact or event. To be sure, by observing certain particularities of the document, I may be able to answer questions concerning its authenticity, its age, its -origin, etc. Such observations, however, will in no way permit me to get acquainted with what it is about. I have to 'understand' it in the sense of getting acquainted with the meanings of the symbols on the document. Hence, the basic role that 'to know,' as acquaintance with facts, has in the natural sciences, is to a great extent taken over in history by 'to under- stand' as 'acquaintance with meanings.' Inmost cases, acquaintance with a historical fact or event is only the result of a previous acquaintance with meaning, this being the reason why sciences of this kind have been called hermeneutical sciences. Furthermore, 'to know' as acquaintance with facts or events is not at all what the historian means by historical knowledge. Some historians may mean an acquaintance exclusively with causal relations. An historical event is 'understood' if one is acquainted with its causes. The historian who would thus limit his science to the establishment of causal relations does so in the misguided hope of being 'scientific,' as if the concept of causality were less anthropomorphic than the concept of purpose. How- ever, a radical elimination from history of the concept of purpose has always proved impossible, because human beings and actions, forming the major subject matter of history, cannot be 'understood' but in terms of purposes, motivations, etc. Hence, historical 'knowledge' means usually</page><page sequence="10">92 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH not only acquaintance with causal relations, but also acquaintance with a teleological nexus. Moreover, besides the two kinds of understanding just mentioned, historical 'knowledge' means a third kind of 'under- standing' not previously encountered. I am referring to the 'wholistic' principle according to which an individual, an action, a work of art, etc., are 'understood' when they are seen as expressing what the historian rather vaguely calls "the spirit" of an age, a nation, a community, etc. This is the acquaintance with neither a causal relation, nor with a teleological relation, but with a certain kind of part-whole relation. Finally, and per- haps the most important point to be made, the ideal of historical knowl- edge, far from being that of a confirmed prediction on the basis of a set of functional equations, is 'understanding' in that extraordinary sense that we encountered in our analysis of everyday language as the one use of 'to understand' that cannot be substituted by 'to know'; namely, 'put- ting myself in the place of.. .,' 'seeing a foreign actuality as my own possibility' or, in one word, identification. Hence, in the hermeneutical sciences or, in any case, in history, 'to know' as 'to be acquainted with historical facts or events' plays only a minor and subservient role. Any other meaning that 'to know' may here have is borrowed from 'to under- stand.' The whole emphasis is on 'to understand.' It, is used as (a) ac- quaintance with meanings; (b) acquaintance with a causal nexus; (c) ac- quaintance with a teleological nexus; (d) acquaintance with a part-whole nexus. These are also the meanings that 'to know' may borrow from 'to understand.' But the terms 'to know' and 'to understand' clash irreconcil- ably when 'to understand' is used for the ideal toward which history tends, the ideal of identification in the sense of making a foreign actuality my own possibility. Summary and Conclusion On the level of everyday language, the distinction between knowledge and understanding is marked by two linguistic facts: (1) We cannot sub- stitute 'to understand' for 'to know' when 'to know' means 'acquaintance with facts or events.' (2) We cannot substitute 'to know' for 'to understand' if 'to understand' means 'to put myself in the place of....' In any other meaning that they may have they are substitutable for each other, although the substitutability may not always be complete. It must be noted, too, that on this level of everyday language, whenever the two terms are sub- stitutable, they are so by virtue of 'to know' borrowing from the richer meaning of 'to understand.' On the level of the sciences, the almost dormant distinction between these two theoretical tendencies becomes more definite, so much so, in fact, that it would seem permissible to divide the sciences, A la Dilthey,</page><page sequence="11">To KNOW AND TO UNDERSTAND 93 into 'knowing sciences' and 'understanding sciences.' At the same time, the emphasis placed by the natural sciences on 'to know' over and against 'to understand' is such that 'to be scientific' and 'to know' are paired against 'to be unscientific' and 'to understand.' In the theory of knowledge, philo- sophical reflection, following in the wake of scientific advance, has analyzed what 'to know' means in the natural sciences; the ideals, standards, and methods of scientific knowledge have been formulated, and the possibilities of justifying its claims investigated. As valuable as these contributions may be, they are unilateral. They do justice neither to the sweeping role of understanding in everyday life, nor to the intentions and methods of the hermeneutical sciences. By not doing justice to them theoretically, they actually have the effect of narrowing man and his capacity of understand- ing. No theory of knowledge can fail to be, or to imply, a theory of man. As scientific as it may aim to be, it moves in the orbit of a conception of what man, the knower, is; and such conceptions have decisional impact: man becomes what he conceives himself to be. The apparently harmless, merely theoretical emphasis on the tendency to know cannot help but grow into a 'practical,' 'moral,' 'existential' emphasis. The tendency toward understanding, not yet quite suppressed, not even in the natural sciences, still vegetates vicariously in the sphere of common sense, emotions, the arts, and the humanities. But the dire consequences of our one-sided Western emphasis on knowledge over and against understanding are be- ginning to make themselves felt in the life of the nations as well as of the individuals. The time has come for the philosopher to be aware of the one- sidedness of his theory of knowledge. This survey of the linguistic usage of 'to know' and 'to understand' may serve as a reminder of the task before us. Aided by the experiences gained in the analysis of the natural sciences (and by the preliminary work done by such men as Dilthey, Rickert, et al.), we are perhaps now ready to lay the foundations of another philo- sophical discipline, the theory of understanding.
