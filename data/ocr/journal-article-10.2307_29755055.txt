<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Hair on the Buddha's Head and Usnisa ? ? ? The Buddha image heads are commonly represented with short curls turning to the right, and with a protuberance on the top of the skull. While these features have been explained as one of the major signs with which a mah?purusa is endowed, the depiction of hair on the skull of a person who had cut off his hair while renouncing the world and who had founded an order of shaven-headed monks has baffled scholars and students of Bud? dhist art and has been the subject matter of great controversy. A study of the evolution of the manner of representation of the Buddha's head would indicate that the Buddha was not shown as shaven-headed, but apparently had hair on his head. In the earliest Gandh?ra Buddhas, there is no cranial bump or protuberance; but luxuriant hair or tresses are tied up on the top of the head. At Mathur? also, the earliest Buddha heads have the kaparda coil, i.e., the hair is curled into a single coil like a snail shell, in the manner of the current type of ascetic (*) coiffure. The next development took place in about the middle of the 2nd century A.D. (2) when the hair was depicted as short curls like snail shells with a bump or protuberance at the top of the skull. R. P. Chanda (3) explains the usnisasirsa (unhisasisa) as a turban-like head. To make the head look like a turban head, Chanda suggests, the addition of a crest was necessary and this was provided by the addition of a bump or fleshy protuberance. ?... the addition of a bump or fleshy protuberance on the top was evidently thought necessary to turn the head of a mah?purusa to a perfect turban head. The so called usnisa on the Buddha's head is the crest of the usnisa and not the usnisa itself ? (4). According to Banerjea (5), the wearing of long hair in different modes was a common custom among the Indo-Aryan males, especially the higher ones. They endowed their gods with this same characteristic. The various gods depicted in the early Indian monuments of the pre-Christian period are shown with luxuriant hair dressed in various ways. He, there? fore, concludes that ? ... in the anthropomorphic representation of the Bh?gavat, the depic? tion of the flowing tresses was quite natural ?.

The Hair and the Usnisa on the Head of the Buddhas and the Jinas?, IHQ, VII, No. 3. It should, however, be noted that there is no usnisa in the earliest Jina images found at Kahk?li til?, in the ?y?gapatas of the pre-Kushan as well as the Jina sculptures of the Kushan period. (3) R. P. Chanda, ibid., pp. 671-72. (4) Ibid., p. 672. (5) J. M. Banerjea, ?Usnisasiraskat?

Again, Banerjea points out, the word usnisa does not occur in the Br?hmanical texts as a mah?purusa-laksana. But the Br?hmanical traditions about the sirolaksana of gods, great men and kings are unanimous in laying down that the outline of the head would resemble that of an expanded umbrella. From the parallel evidence of the early as well as the later Br?hmanical texts, Banerjea comes to the conclusion that the early Buddhist writers did not mean by the term unhisa sisa ? the bony protuberance of the head ?; the Buddhist writers adopted the signs (mah? purusalaksana) from Br?hmins and applied them to the person of the Buddha. Mrs. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw shares the opinion of Coomaraswamy that the Buddha type has been copied from the Yaksa type (6): ? ...in the mind of the masses the Buddha approached their conception of Yaksas and as for the earliest Buddha representations they almost com? pletely copied the already existing representations of Yaksas, who had the semblance of monarchs ? (7). According to her, it was customary for kings in India at that time to dress up the hair in a knot on the head and to put on a turban, the turban being the token of dignity par excellence (8) in India. ? In imitation of the living monarchs the Yaksa images and other gods had their hair tied up in a knot ? (9) and wore turbans. But ? when the figure of the Buddha had to be represented in human form, the sculptor met with the difficulty that it was explicitly known of the Master that he, having become a mendicant friar, had laid aside all his regalia. Consequently, all those royal characteristics of the Yaksa images, like ornaments and turban, could not be reproduced. So the Buddha figure is, as it were, a Yaksa, or rather a monarch without regalia. The bracelets, necklaces, and other ornaments were simply omitted and the head, now uncovered, was given the hair-dressing occasionally shown by the Yaksas or kings as well, when not wearing a turban, that is to say, the Buddha was represented with a top-knot of hair, the so-called kaparda ? (10). All this is a roundabout argument: in short, according to van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, the Buddha was given hair on his head aftei the fashion in vogue among the kings Van Lohuizen-de Leeuw also says that the usnisalaksana was only added later on to the list of the mah?purusalaksanas by Buddhists as it does not occur in other lists of laksanas of (6) J. E. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, The ? Scythian ? Period, Leiden, 1949, p. 154. O Ibid., p. 206. (8) Ibid., p. 163. (9) Ibid., p. 164. (10) Ibid., p. 166. In fact, J. E. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw says: ? Personally we would rather explain the Buddha image as derived from the king type, but in essence this does not greatly differ from A. K. Cooma raswamy's explanation ? (ibid., p. 153). She also adds that ? ...It is clear that the Buddha figure shows a strong resemblance to the Yaksa figure, which can certainly not be said of the Jina figure ? (ibid., p. 167), inasmuch as the Jina image is wholly naked, the seated image is always in the dhy?na mudr? and the standing image is stiff, motionless and with arms hanging down. From these obser? vations of van Lohuizen-de Leeuw it can be safely concluded that even the Buddha image was not derived from Yaksa or king prototype as the emergence of Buddha and Jina images is almost contemporaneous; perhaps the Jina image prece? ded the Buddha image. 276</page><page sequence="3">a mah?purusa (12). She observes, ? Not until much later was it (usnisa) understood as a protuberance of the skull &gt;&gt; (13) and the general sense of the word as ? cranial bump ? is mainly based on later Buddhistic texts (14). In fact, Foucher, Coomaraswamy and van Lohui? zen-de Leeuw are agreed that the word usnisa originally did not mean ? protuberance of the skull ? (15) but simply a ? turban ?. Subsequently the top-knot on the turbanless head of an ascetic like the Buddha connoted usnisa, i.e., it meant a hair coil (16). The word underwent another change in its meaning when snail shell curls were depicted on Buddha heads from Mathur?. Van Lohuizen-de Leeuw observes: ? When, however, at Mathur?, the snail-shell curls which indeed can create the impression of short-frizzy hair, began to be reproduced, on the same shape of head, the impression of a knot of hair was eventually lost and so it came to be believed that a protuberance and not a knot was meant ? (17). Thus the conception of usnisa as a protuberance originated much later (18). She, however, is unable to say for what reasons snail curl technique became popular. She considers that perhaps this way of representing curly hair was better known and appealed more to the people of Mathur? (19) than the other methods. The Buddha is supposed to have been born with 32 mah?purusa (and 80 anuvyanjana) laksanas including the usnisa (a turban in its original sense) and possessing forty teeth. According to Coomaraswamy (20), ? ...it is hard to believe that it was originally meant that the child was born with a turban on its head or with fully developed teeth. The thirty two laksanas were borrowed in their entirety from Br?hmanical sources and are really the characteristics of an adult cakravartin and mah?purusa and as such and without modi? fication were applied to the infant Bodhisattva when the cakravartin concept came into prominence ?. Perhaps the suggestion was that the Buddha was ? destined to wear a tur? ban ?. ? It was assumed that the laksanas having been recognised in infancy must have been present in infancy and hence the unhlsaslso of the Kapardin type had to be interpreted as a physical appearance. The result was the representation of the usnisa as a protube? rance and at the same time the tonsure was reinterpreted as resulting in a crop of short curls, rather than a single coil ?. The depiction of the short curls was in accordance with the Nid?nakath?. This is how Coomaraswamy accounts for the cranial bump and short curls. To quote van Lohuizen-de Leeuw (21), ? according to Coomaraswamy, the change in the way of representing the hair occurs at about the same time as, and as a result of, the change in the significance of the word usnisa from ? turban ? into ? protuberance ?. According to Foucher (22) the genesis of the protuberance of the skull must be con? nected with the change in the representation of the hair. Coomaraswamy (23) summarizes the opinion of Foucher thus: Gandh?ran sculptors had represented the hair of the Buddha (12) Ibid., p. 210. (13) Ibid., pp. 164-165. (14) Ibid., p. 163. (15) Ibid., p. 165. (16) Ibid., p. 210. (17) Ibid., p. 212. (18) Ibid., p. 213. D Ibid., p. 212. (20) Coomaraswamy, op. cit.f pp. 831-834. (21) van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, op. cit., p. 207.

See also van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, op. cit., pp. 208-09. 277</page><page sequence="4">in flowing tresses gathered together in a topknot in Indian fashion, avoiding the represen? tation of a protuberance for aesthetic reasons. Later imitators, dissatisiied with so obvious a departure from facts as they must have been, for all are agreed that the Bodhisattva cut off his hair, interpreted the Gandh?ran chignon as covering a cranial bump and supposed that this bump was what had been referred to in the phrase unhisasiso of the Mah?pad?na sutta; they replaced the long hair with short curls, more or less in accordance with the tradi? tion preserved in the Nidanakath? leaving the cranial bump conspicuously in evidence (24). According to Kramrisch (25), some of the thirty-two signs of the mah?purusa, are non anthropomorphical. They are the 'cosmognomicaP emblems of his substance and the physio? gnomical traits of his body. They are indicative of the lokottara character of the Buddha. Of the usnisa in particular, she says that this emblem ? shows an extension of the body-like appearance of the Buddha beyond its anthropomorphical limits... It stands for the mah?? purusa or nirguna ? (26). It is neither a turban nor a bony protuberance or a fleshy growth; only to describe it the last two anthropomorphical secundae comparationes have been used. It is not a thing. It is an emblem and refers to the super-sensible. It has no prototype in nature (27). ? The shape of man clings to the image of the Buddha lokottara. Where it outgrows this semblance is the mark of the usnisa... ? (28). Kramrisch (29) calls it an invi? sible psychic protuberance on the crown of the head, a sign of proficiency in Yogic practices, a symptom analogous to Stigmatisation. In Japanese (30) sculptural tradition the usnisa shows that he, the Buddha, knows all, the urn? (the third eye), that he sees all, and the lambakarna (elongated ear lobes), that he hears all. In short, these inconographical peculiarities emphasized the Buddhahood of S?kya muni. THE BUDDHA'S HAIR. Coomaraswamy has based his explanation of the hair on Buddha's head solely on the tradition embodied in the Nid?nakath?, a commentary written by Buddhaghosa in the 5th century A.D. on the J?takas. It is stated therein that the bodhisattva ? then taking his sword in his right hand, and holding the plaited tresses together with the diadem on them, with his left, he cut them off. So his hair was thus reduced to two inches in length, and curling from the right, it lay close to his head. It remained that length as long as he lived, and the beard the same. There was no need at all to shave either hair or beard any more ? (31). (24) Thus, according to A. Foucher, the curly hair was depicted after the Buddha's head was endowed with a cranial bump. This is not correct. It is noteworthy that the Jina heads from Mathur? of the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D. have the con? ventional curls on their heads without the cranial protuberance which makes its appearance in the 4th and 5th centuries A.D. See the Jina sculptures in the Prince of Wales Museum, Bombay. See also van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, op. cit., pp. 167-68. (25) S. Kramrisch, ? Emblems of the Univer sal Being ?, JISOA, 3, 1935, p. 148.

Rhys Davids, Buddhist Birth Sto? ries, London, 1880, p. 86. 278</page><page sequence="5">From the fact that hair was reduced to a length of two inches uniformly, Coo maraswamy makes the presumption that ? the hair instead of being cut off at a single stroke, had been shorn by a succession of strokes, leaving the hair of equal length all over the head... ? and thus caused the hair to be shown as numerous small curls instead of a single large coil (kaparda) (32). A careful reading of the different accounts of the Mahabhiniskramana would indicate that Coomaraswamy has built up his thesis on very tenuous evidence of very late date which is not corroborated by the earlier and other versions of this incident, by iconogra? phy, and by the absence of any tradition regarding the curly hair and protuberance on the head of Jinas whose sculptural representations possess similar iconographical peculiarities. (a) Literary evidence: In the Ariyapariyesana (i, 163), Mah?saccaka (i, 240), Bodhir?jakum?ra (ii, 93) and San g?rava (ii, 211), suttas of the Majjhimanik?ya (33), the Buddha states that he cut off his hair and beard and donned the yellow robes. There is no mention of two inches length of hair remaining on the head. This is also identical to the pabbajj? ordination (34) of a no? vice who has to first have his hair and beard cut off and then put on the yellow robes. Again it is evident from Mah?saccaka (i, 240) and Sang?rava (ii, 211) suttas that it was the cPilgrim... free as the air5 i.e., a parivr?jaka, that inspired the bodhisattva to cut off his hair. According to the accepted tradition, the parivr?jakas either had a tonsure or wore matted hair and their practices did not enjoin or permit keeping cropped hair as im? plied in the version of the Nid?nakath?. The accounts of the Great Renunciation in the Mah?vastu (35), the Laiitavistara (36), Buddhacarita (37) of Asvaghosa and the Life of the Buddha contained in Tibetan (38) works (32) coomaraswamy, Op. tit., p. 828. (33) Lord Chalmers, Further Dialogues of the Buddha, London, 1926-27, vols. I, II. The Ariyapariyesana Sutta narrates: ?There came a time when I quite young, with a wealth of cool black hair untouched by grey and in all the beauty of my early prime... cut off my hair and beard, donned the yellow robes and went forth from house to houselessness on pilgrimage... ?. The account in other suttas is similar. (a4) The Mah?vagga I, 54, 3, translated by T. W. Rhys Davids, H. Oldenberg (Sacred Books of the East, XIII), Oxford, 1881, p. 209. (35) The Mah?vastu II, 165, translated by J. Jones, London, 1952, vol. II, pp. 159-161. After taking final leave of Chandaka the Bodhisattva said to himself: ? How can I become a wanderer with this tuft of hair on the crown of my head? ?. So the Bodhisattva cut off the tuft with his knife. (36) The Lalitavistara, ed. by P. L. Vaidya, Darbhanga, 1958, p. 164: Cautama reflecting ? "Where indeed is the C?d?, where the life of a parivr?jaka", he cut off his hair (C?d?) with the sword and threw it up in the air ?. (3r) Asvaghosa's Buddhacarita, translated by E. B. Cowell (Sacred Books of the East, XLIX), Oxford, 1894, VI, 51. ? Having drawn it (the sharp jewelled sword) forth, dark blue like a blue lotus petal, he cut his decorated tiara and his hair, and he tossed it with its scattered muslin into the air as a grey goose into a lake?. The version is practically identical in Johnston's translation of Asvaghosa's Buddhacarita. (38) W. W. Rockhill, The Life of the Buddha and the Early History of His Order, London, 1884, p. 25. It may also be noted that in the Mah?pad?na Sutta (Dighanik?ya ii, 29 and 30) it is stated that the bodhisattva Vipassi, while renouncing the world, cut off his hair and donned the yellow robe and hearing about this, some eighty-four thousand souls thought: ? Surely this is no ordinary religious rule, this is no common going forth, in that the lord Vipassi himself has had this head shaved and has donned the yellow robe and has gone forth 279</page><page sequence="6">do not make any mention, as in the Nid?nakath?, of cropped hair rernaining on the Buddha's head. The Chinese version, of about the 6th century A.D., of the Abhiniskramana Sutra ? Fo-Pen-hing-King (39) ? explicitly states that the bodhisattva had shaved his head. To quote in extenso: ? Then the prince, having delivered the gem from his head dress, and the other decorations, into the heads of Tschandaka, drew forth his sword from his sheath, and holding it in his right hand, he seized with his left his rosy curling locks, in colour like the Utpala flower, and severed them from his head; then casting them into the air, Sakra, with joyous heart caught them before they fell to the earth, and ascending upwards, paid them divine honour in company with the other Devas ?. Further it is stated: ? Then the prince, having with his own hands taken off all the jewels and having also had the hair that covered his head, like a diadem, clean shaved off, still perceived that his garments were rather those of a Deva than a recluse ?. It should be noted that in the Abhiniskramana the Buddha had a shave (tonsure) and not a haircut. The version contained in the Nid?nakath? is followed in the Burmese (40) and Siamese (41) versions of the life of the Buddha. Obviously these were based on the Nid?nakath?. It is also significant that according to the Nid?nakath?, the length of the Buddha's hair as well as of his beard remained the same as long as he lived. But in sculpture the Buddha is invariably shown without a beard. It is inconceivable that the Nid?nakath? was followed in sculpture only partly. Again in the Cullavagga V,2 (42), completed at the end of the 1st century after the Bud? dha's death, the Buddha enjoins that the monks could not wear long hair: ? I allow you, O Bhikkhus, hair that is two months old, or two inches long ?. Perhaps the Nid?nakath?, in accordance with the Vinaya, records that the Buddha's hair was only two inches long after renunciation. It is also to be noted that the monks are shown in art with tonsured heads and with no curls. Evidently the significance of the Nid?nakath? version regarding the length of hair on the Bhuddha's head has been overemphasised. (b) Iconography: The Nid?nakath? version does not explain the earliest types of Buddha heads from Gan dh?ra wherein flowing tresses are tied up into a chignon or the Kapardin type from Ma from the House into the Homeless state. If the lord VipassI has done this, why then should not we also? And they all had their heads shaved, and donned the yellow robe and in imitation of Vi? passI the Bodhisattva, they went from Home into the Homeless State ?. It is significant that the bo? dhisattva VipassI had shaved his head which is quite different from cutting off hair to a short length. Again in the ? Legend of Dipankara Buddha ?, translated from the Chinese by S. Beal, JRAS, 1873, p. 381, it is stated that the Dipahkara Bod bisattva ? shaved his head ? and became a recluse. (39) S. Beal, The Romantic Legend of S?kya Buddha from Chinese Sanskrit, London, 1875, p. 144. (40) P. Bigandet, The Life or Legend of Gau? tama, 4th ed., London, 1911, p. 65. (41) H. Alabaster, The Wheel of the Law, London, 1871, p. 130. In both these versions, the length of the re? maining hair is said to be V/i*\ (42) T. W. Rhys Davids, H.

These types of hair arrangement on Buddha's head could only be explained by assuming that the sculptors had disregarded the scriptural tradition. This could not be. Besides, as already observed, the Buddha is not represented with a beard. Evidently the tradition embodied in the Nid?na? kath? was not adhered to. (c) Jaina tradition and Iconography. In the early sculptures of the Tirthamkaras we find the heads endowed with curly and other styles of hair as in the case of the Buddha (43). But the Jaina accounts of the lives of the Tirthamkaras do not state that short-length hair was left on their heads after they severed their hair on renouncing the world. In the Kalpas?tra (44) of Bhadrab?hu it is stated ? Then under the excellent tree Asoka, he (Mahavira) caused his palankin to stop, descended from his palankin, took off his ornaments, garlands, and finery with his own hands, and with his own hands plucked out his hair in five handfuls. When the moon was in conjunction with the asterism uttaraph?lg?ni, he after fasting two and a half days, with? out drinking water, put on a divine robe, and quite alone, nobody else being present, he tore out his hair and leaving the house entered in the state of houselessness ?. The account of renunciation in the lives of P?rsvan?tha, Aristanemi and Rsabhan?tha is identical. In fact P?rsvan?tha is called Luncitakesa (45), ? Plucked Head ?. Notwithstanding these traditions and notwithstanding the absence of a tradition similar to that in the Nid?nakath? regarding short hair on their head, the Jina heads are covered with conventional curly hair. In fact many of the Jina heads, except those of the Kushan period, are exactly similar to those of the Buddhas inasmuch as there is a protuberance on them covered with snail shell curls. We suggest that the representation of long tresses of hair, either tied up as a chignon or as a kaparda, on the head, was primarily because the Buddha was originally conceived not as a monk, in whose case alone the scriptural tradition had historical validity, but as an extraordinary being. When the aniconic tradition was abandoned and the Buddha was represented in human form, the question that must have posed itself to the sculptor was how the anthropomor? phic representation of the Buddha could be distinguished from that of an ordinary human being. The brahman Dona asks the lord: ? Will your reverence become a deva? ?. ? No, indeed, brahman, I will not become a deva ?. (43) In the Jina sculptures the hair assumes the appearance of a periwig or is falling on shoulders or is in wavy rows or schematic waves and pa? rallel crescents or is shown in the form of a raised band of a distinctive line on the head indicating plainly dressed hair. See V. A. Smith, The Jaina Stupa and Other Antiquities of Mathur?, Allaha? bad, 1901; J. P. H. Vogel, Sarnath Museum Ca? talogue, Calcutta, 1914, pp. 41-42 and V. S. Agra Wala, Mathur?

Brahman, these fluxions (?savas) whereby, if they were not abandoned, I should be? come a deva ? those fluxions in me are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm tree stump, made non-existent, of a nature not to arise again in a future time. Those fluxions whereby, if they were not abandoned, I should become a gandharva, a Yakkha, a human being ? those fluxions in me are abandoned ? not to arrive again in a future time ? (46). In fact to the five Bhiksus who were his first associates, the Buddha said after enlighten? ment: ? Do not address, O Bhikkhus, the Tath?gata by his name and with the appellation ? Friend ?. The Tath?gata, O Bhikkhus, is the holy, absolute Sambuddha ? (47). Thus the Buddha had claimed a unique position, more precisely, entity, for himself. In the Niddesa the Buddha is called dev?tideva, the god beyond the gods (48). In Buddhist cosmology Brahm? is the highest of the gods. He belongs to the r?padh?tu, one of the three dh?tus, (k?madh?tu, r?padh?tu and ar?padh?tu). In his realm, there is no longer cupidity, the inhabitants have only shape or form, are sexless and born without parents by apparitional birth (4*). The highest of the Brahm? heavens belongs to Brahm? himself. In his anthropomorphic representation, the Buddha necessarily belongs to r?padh?tu. As such, the Buddha (50) was sculpted in the fashion in which Brahm? was conceived by the Bud? dhists. Brahm?, in Indian iconography, is invariably endowed with locks of hair, a jat?-mukuta. That explains why the sculptors of Gandh?ra and Mathur? fashioned the Buddha as possessing luxuriant hair. In early Buddhist art Brahm? is single-faced and generally unadorned (51).

Only in fig. 99: Birth of the Buddha, Brahm? appears to have a headdress and some ornaments. 282</page><page sequence="12">There could be another reason for fashioning the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha in the likeness of Brahm?. According to Dighanik?ya (52) i, 17-22, Brahm? appears at the beginning of the evolution of the universe, as Praj?pati. Before the rise of Saivism and Visnuism to theological predominance in the period after the death of Christ, Brahm? was the supreme of the Br?hmanical gods. Consequently, the Buddha, though superior to Brahm?, was essentially conceived in the image of the highest of these gods (53). Literary tradition bears this out. In Dighanik?ya (54), i, 115, Sonadanda says that the Buddha ? is beautiful, fair, attractive, with a lovely complexion like Brahm? ?. It is stated that on his return to Kapilavastu, Yasodhar? said to R?hula: ? This holy man, whose ap? pearance is so glorious that he looks like the great Brahm?, is thy father... ? (55). The Mah?vaslu (56) ii, 30 and 306, in enumerating the mah?purusa-laksanas, says that the Bud? dha possesses a voice like that of Brahm?, brahmasvara. Asita on seeing the child Gautama is reported to have made a significant statement: ? I do not worship Brahm?, but I worship this child... ? (57). THE BUDDHA'S USNISA. Corresponding to the term usnisa in Sanskrit, we have unhisa in Pali. In the Digha? nik?ya (58) and Majjhimanik?ya (5f), unhlsa-slsa, one of the mah?purusa-laksanas, means a turban-like head, a big head. In the Mah?vastu (60) this laksana means ca head shaped like a royal turban5. In Asvaghosa's Buddhacarita (61), usnisa is not mentioned among the auspicious signs noticed by Asita. (52) A. K. coomaraswamy, L B. horner, op. cit., chap. V, I, pp. 165-68. (53) It may be noted that in the early J?taka tales the Buddha claimed to have been one or other of the gods in former times, 4 times as Brahm? (the most exalted of all at the epoch of the Buddha), 20 times as Sakra or Indra, 43 times as a tree-god and once as a fairy. L. A. Waddell, Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, vol. IV, ?

In the Chinese version of the Buddhacarita, The Fo suo hsing tsan ching translated by S. Beal (Sacred Books of the East, XIX), Oxford, 1883,1, pp. 183 84, the sage Asita beheld on the body of the newly born prince Siddh?rtha, the thousand-rayed wheel on the soles of his feet, the web-like filaments between the fingers, between his eye? brows the white wool-like prominence, his private parts hidden as those of the horse and his com? plexion bright and lustrous. There is no mention of usnisa. 283</page><page sequence="13">In the Lalitavistara (62), usnlsa-sirsa, a coil of curly hair on the head, is one of the thirty-two signs of mah?purusa enumerated. It is only in the Phu-Yau-King (63), the second version of the Lalitavistara known in China and dated A.D. 308, that Asita, while observ? ing the mah?purusa-laksanas on the Buddha's person, perceived ? on the summit of his head a fleshy excrescence ?. Gand?vy?ha (2nd or 3rd century A.D.) describes it as ? centrally placed hair ornament ? (64). As already noted earlier, Buddhaghosa (5th century A.D.) in his Sumangalavil?sint, explains the laksana unhisasisa, as referring to the well-developed forehead (paripunnanal?ta) and the well-developed head (paripunnasisa) of the Mah?purusa. According to him, this refers to the mass of flesh which rises from the root of the right ear, extends over and thus covers the whole of the forehead and ends near the root of the left ear, resembling the tied turban folds of kings (65). In the Mah?vyutpatti (66) LXIII (14), the laksana is described as usnlsasiraskata. The meaning in Tibetan has been rendered as ? having on the crown of his head an ornamental excrescence ?. It is to be noted that it is only an ornamental and not a physical (cranial) protuberance. In the M?nas?ra (67) (500 700 A.D.) the Buddha is described as having usnisojjvala-maulikam, a shining top knot on the crown. In the Ratnagotravibh?ga (68), also known as Uttaratantra (7th century A.D.) the Buddha is called dv?trimsanmah?purusalaksanar?padh?ri and the 26th laksana is Usni sasirsa. In the Pratim?m?na Laksanam (M), a Buddhist iconometrical work belonging perhaps to the 7th century A.D. the word usnisa-sirsa does not occur; it is merely stated that the head should be of the form of an umbrella (70). In Sankrit the word usnisa has always meant a turban. In the Aitareya and datapath a Br?hmana (71), the word usnisa signifies a turban. According to the Satapatha Br?hmana (62) Rajendra Lal Mitra, Lalitavistara (trans? lation), Calcutta, 1881-1886, p. 142. (63) S. Beal, in The Fo suo hsing tsan ching (Sacred Books of the East, XIX), Oxford, 1883, note 11, p. 359. S. Beal in The Romantic Legend of S?kya Buddha from Chinese Sanskrit, London, 1875, foot? note 1, p. 59, observes that the Chinese edition adds: ? These three signs (curly hair and turning to the right and the fleshy projection at the top of the cranium) are wanting in the original ?. (M) ?madhy?bhiinyastakes?lamk?ram?.

(72) on the occasions of the Vajapeya and R?jas?ya sacrifices, the king used to put on a special headdress signifying his royalty. In Amara's N?malihg? mus?sanam (73) with commentary by Ksirasv?min, the word usnisa means a braid of hair, a turban, a diadem. Hal?yudhakosa interprets it as a turban (protection against heat, sun? shade), a diadem, a braid of hair. As observed by Coomaraswamy (74), there is no literary evidence whatsoever to suggest that the word usnisa, unhlsa, ever referred to any physical peculiarity, such as a bony protuberance. Again it is stated in the Amit?yurdhy?na S?tra (75) that of Avalokites'vara ? All the other signs of his body and the minor marks of excellence are perfect, and not at all different from those of Buddha, except the signs of having the turban on his head and the top of his head invisible, which two signs of him are inferior to those of the World Honoured One... ?. There could be no question of the top of the Bud? dha's head being invisible if the usnisa is a cranial protuberance. In many sculptures from Gandh?ra (76), a circular formation between the eyebrows commonly called the ?rn? is clearly represented while there is no protuberance on the Bud? dha's head, the hair of the head being tied up as a chignon. The hair also is certainly not depicted as conventional curls in many of these heads. If usnisa is interpreted to mean cranial protuberance or bump, it would be surprising indeed that this important mah?puru salaksana was not represented on the Buddha heads, when perhaps ?rn?, another of the lak sanas was clearly depicted. It could not be due to the inability of the artists to make a cranial bump on the head. In our opinion the absence of the cranial protuberance can be explain? ed only by the fact that the mah?purusalaksana did not stand for such a physical abnor? mality. Though many of the jinas of the post-Kushan period possess an usnisa similar to that of the Buddha, the word usnisa does not occur in early Jaina literature. In the Vasude vahindi of Sanghad?sa (7T) (4th-5th century A.D.) Rsabha is described as having a top ? of the shape of an umbrella ?. According to the Aupap?tika Sutra, 16 (78) (5th century A.D.)

Aupap?tika Sutra, commented upon by Shri Ghasi Lalji and arranged by Shri 285</page><page sequence="15">the head of Mah?vira had a dense and closely piled up round swelling or protuberance resembling the shape of a lofty mountain peak. The commentator Abhayadevas?ri (79) (11th century A.D.) explains this as usnisalaksana and describes it as a stony protuberance (p?s?na pindika). Ravisena (80) (678 A.D.) in his Padmapur?na 3, 189 describing the abhiseka of Rsabhadeva at his birth states that the hair on the crown of his head, viz., the sikh?, was endowed with a pure ruby (lotus hued jewel) from the rays of which the head of the lord appeared to possess jat?s (matted locks of hair). According to the ?dipur?na (81) of Jinasena (9th century A.D.) Rsabhadeva's head endowed with black hair and decorated with a tiara showed like the peak of mount Meru resplendent with sapphires. According to Uttarapu r?na 63, 419 (82) of Gunabhadra (9th century A.D.), the head of S?ntin?tha was eminent like the peak of the mount Meru. According to Hemacandra (83) (llth-12th century A.D.), the forehead of Rsabhadeva was ? broad, fleshy round, firm, soft, smooth... the head gra? dually arched, rivalled in appearance an umbrella, with its face turned downwards. The round, tall headdress (usnisa) on the head-umbrella of the Great Lord indicating lordship over the three worlds, took on the appearance of the projecting point (of an umbrella) ?. The same commentator giving the personal description of Sambhavan?tha (84) says ? Wearing a high turban (usnisa) round like an umbrella... his forehead resembling the moon of the eighth day in beauty... ?. Thus the protuberance on the head of Jinas is compared to a mountain peak or an umbrella and there is no suggestion whatsoever that the usnisa was a cranial bump or a bony protuberance (85). Much of the controversy and confusion regarding the usnlsa and the iconographical pe? culiarities in the Buddha sculptures arise from the fact that various scholars have tried tc interpret them in the light of mah?purusalaksanas. But, as we shall presently show, the mah?purusalaksanas are not usually represented in the sculptural representation of the Bud Kannhaiyya Lalji Maharaja. Jaina S?strodhara Samiti, Rajkot, 1959, p. 84.

In the Gujar?ti translation of Visvakarma's treatise on architecture, JTtp?rnava, Palitana, 1960, by P. O.

The Mah?pad?na Sutta and the Lakkhana Suit a of the Dighani k?ya and the Brahm?yu Sutta of the Majjhimanik?ya, the Lalitavistara and the Dharma samgraha, inter alia, speak of the following of the thirty-two marks on Buddha's body, be? sides the usnisa, which can be depicted: (1) wheels with thousand spokes and rim and nave on the soles of the feet (2) projecting heels (3) long fingers (4) j?la (j?l?vanaddha) hasta p?da, webbed hands and feet (5) prominent ankles (6) antelope limbs (7) sthit?navanata-pra lambab?hu, when standing or not stooping, his hands reach his knees (8) there is one hair to each pore of the skin (9) the hairs of the body are black rising straight and curling to the right (10) nyagrodhaparimandala, his height is equal to his outstretched arms (11) white hair between the eyebrows (?rn?). In iconography certain mah?purusalaksanas are never shown (86) on a Buddha sculpture. Instances are (1) c webbed5 toes; (2) hair on the body as distinct from the head; (3) the two laksanas, viz., nyagrodhaparimandala, the height of the body being equal to the length of the outstretched arms, and sthit?navanata-pralambab?hut?, standing, not bending himself, his hands could touch the knees, are inconsistent (87): in fact in sculptures the length of the arms does not usually reach the knees while standing erect. Again the ?rn? appears only in the early Buddhist sculptures from Gandh?ra; it is a less marked feature of the Buddhas from Mathur? and it eventually disappears altogether (88). Likewise, the palms and soles of the feet of the Buddha do not invariably show the wheel, cakra. Again the Buddha sculptures show the Buddha as possessing long ear-lobes ? pin?yata karn?. This is not a mah?purusalaksana. It is also doubtful if it was one of the eighty anuvyanjanas (89). It should be noted that these laksanas were not manifest or visible to everyone at the birth of the Buddha; they were only perceived by sage Asita after examination of the infant and could be recognised only by those skilled in the science of signs. In the Diamond S?tra, it is explicitly stated that the Buddha is not to be identified by mah?purusalaksanas. ? The Lord asked: What do you think, Subh?ti, can the Tath?gata be seen by means of his possession of marks? ? Subh?ti replied: No indeed, O Lord, not as I understand what the Lord has taught ? The Lord said: Well said, well said, Subh?ti. (86) S. Kramrisch, ?Emblems of the Uni? versal Beings? JISOA, 3, 1935, p. 160, n. 4, p. 158. (87) As S. Kramrisch puts it these two laksa? nas cannot possibly be employed in the same ima? ge, ibid., p. 164, n. 2. (88) Raghuvira, Chikya Yamamoto, The Buddha and Bodhisattva in Indian Sculpture, Lahore, 1938-41. The stone sculptures in the Gandh?ra have ?rn? as a rule but in stuccos it tends to disappear. In the Mathur? school it tends to disappear. It disappears altogether in S?rn?th (Mrgad?va) school. The Sinhalese Buddhas have no such mark. See Notes of the authors to Table XIII and the Corresponding Supplementary Table, vols. I, III. (89) Only in the anuvyanjanas enunciated in the Mah?vyutpatti {Sanskrit-Tibetan-English Vocabu? lary) transl. by Csoma De Koros and ed. by Denison Ross and Vidyabhushana, LXIV (15), (68) and in R. S. Hardy, Manual of Buddhism, London, 1880 (p. 370) is this lesser characteristic sign mentioned. As pointed out by S. Kramrisch, ? Marks of the Great Being, Mah?purusa Laksa? na ?, The Golden Book of Tagore, ed. Ramananda Chatterje, Calcutta, 1931, pp. 288-89, in sculp? ture the ear-lobes are not only elongated but the entire ear is expanded beyond the normal length. 287</page><page sequence="17">So it is, Subh?ti, so it is, as you say. For if the Tath?gata were one who could be seen by his possession of the thirty-two Marks, then also the universal monarch would be a Tath?? gata. Therefore the Tath?gata is not to be seen by means of his possession of Marks ? (90). It is also significant that there is no tradition of the mah?purusalaksanas in the Jaina literature. There are only descriptions (varnakas) of Jinas which give their special features or characteristics. Srivatsa is the only distinguishing mark of the Jinas; in other respects, including the representation of usnisa, there is little to distinguish the sculptures of Jinas (91) from those of the Buddha, except for the kayotsarga pose, and the exhibition of the private parts in Digambara iconography. According to the Buddhist tradition, a person endowed with the thirty-two marks of a mah?purusa has only two careers open to him: either he becomes a Buddha or a cakra vartin monarch. Is a cakravartin in iconographical representation shown as possessing mah?? purusalaksanas? A cakravartin is depicted in the Buddhist art of Amar?vatI (92). He is identified by the seven traditional emblems of sovereignty: the wheel, jewel, horse, elephant, minister, general and woman. The cakravartin has none of the characteristics of mah?pu? rusa. There is no indication that he possessed a cranial bump, though it could be concealed in the high headdress if he possessed one. There is also no ?rn?, and no wheel on the palm of the left hand which is held out open. In literature also, Br?hmanical, Buddhist and Jaina, a cakravartin is distinguished by the possession of ratnas (93) (jewels) and not by mah?pu? rusalaksanas. We, therefore, conclude that the cranial protuberance does not represent a mah?pu rusalaksana. In fact the literal meaning of the word usnisa is a head wearing a cap or turban or a turban head. It does not mean a protuberance of the skull. Usnisa may be a mah?purusalaksana but it does not stand for the cranial bump that we see in sculptures (90) E. Conze, Buddhist Scriptures, London, 1959, p. 166. (91) It may be observed that the ?rn? does not appear in the Jaina sculptures. (92) W. B. Forman, M. M.

In pis. 41 and 43 the crest of the headdress is in the front of the head and not on the fontanelle minor where the so-called protuberance is seen. Coomaraswamy observes that ?... notwithstanding that Hindu deities are gen? erally represented in the guise of great kings, rulers of particular spheres of the whole universe, no known example of Hindu sculpture presents us with a deity having a cranial protuberance... ? (op. tit., p. 835). (93) Br?hmanical Literature: According to Brhadevat? (c. 400 B. C.) a cakravartin has seven jewels: wheel, car (ratha), jewel, wife, terri? tory (bh?mi), horse and elephant. Sridhara com? menting on a passage in Bh?gavata Rur?na enu? merates fourteen mah?ratnas: elephant, horse, car, wife, arrow, treasure, wealth, garment, tree, javelin, noose, jewel, parasol and vim?na. (ii) Buddhist Literature: Seven treasures as already enumerated in describing the panel from Amar?vati. (iii) Jaina Literature: According to Hemacandra: Trisastisa l?k?purusacaritra, Bharata, the first cakravartin acquires fourteen ratnas: cakra, parasol, sword, rod, cowrie, piece of leather, jewel, the nine treasures, general, steward, purohit, architect, elephant and horse. In addition he also gains the fifteenth, the striratna, wife. See Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, vol. 3, s.v. ?Cakravartin?, 336-337; vol. 7, s.v. ?Jewel?, 553-557.

I, p. 350. 288</page><page sequence="18">of the Buddha. The usnlsa in the case of the Buddha (and Jinas) is clearly in the nature of a tuft of hair on the crown of the head. It is the spiritual counterpart of the usnlsa worn by Kings and Brahmins on the occasion of the R?jas?ya and Vajapeya sacrifices. In the R?ja s?ya (94) sacrifice, a person before being anointed as king, is endowed, inter alia, with a turban (usnisa) signifying his birth into royalty: without the usnisa, he could not undergo the abhiseka, the ceremony consecrating him a king. Likewise, the usnisa on the head of Buddha (and a Jina) is indicative of Buddha's spiritual sovereignty. The Buddha was conceived as the spiritual or divine counterpart of a cakravartin. Just as the cakravartin turned the earthly wheel, so did the Buddha turn the wheel of dharma; just as the cakravartin was en? dowed with a crown of temporal royalty, so was the Buddha endowed with an usnisa which symbolised his attainment of spiritual sovereignty. As Hemacandra describing the usnisa of Rsabhadeva puts it, the usnisa, indicated ? lordship over the three worlds ? (95). It was a crown (96) formed by the tuft of hair, the usnisa-maulikam of the M?nas?ra (97). It was only when the inconsistency of the Buddha possessing long tresses of hair tied up in a chignon as in Gandh?ra or in a single large coil (kaparda) as at Mathur?, in the fashion of Brahma, with the scriptural and literary tradition regarding the mah?purusalak sanas was realised, that the usnisa of sikh? was depicted distinctly as a top-knot of hair ap? pearing like an excrescence, and in addition, the hair was shown as curling to the right (pradaksin?varitakesa). Y. Krishan (*4) The author is grateful to ?c?rya Visva Bandhu and Sri Virendra of the Vishveshvaranand Vedic Research Institute, Hoshiarpur, for furnish? ing him with the precise meaning of usnisa on the occasion of the R?jas?ya sacrifice as in the Mai tr?yanisamhit?, Taittirlya Br?hmana and Satapatba Br?hmana. According to the Taittirlya Br?hmana and Taittirlya Samhit? usnisa is ? the womb of royal power ?. According to Maitr?yaniyas and White Yajurveda it signifies the umbilical cord, n?bhi, of the royal power. See J. C.
