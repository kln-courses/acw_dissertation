<plain_text><page sequence="1">English summaries Folk medicine. Questions of method (by A.M. Di Nola) During the last few decades a certain number of contribu- tions have increased around the meaning and content of &lt;folk medicine&gt;&gt; using different referents of classification and terminology. There are two sectors in particular whe- re research and cataloguing have diverged. The first con- cerns physiological ailments and disorders; the second re- gards illnesses which fall within the behavioural and psy- chological sphere. This division, which is now well-esta- blished, must be re-examined since it distorts, to some ex- tent, the unitary vision of man and the world which cha- racterizes the diagnostics and therapeutics of the masses. Anthropology and folk medicine. Notes on the italian po- sitivist studies (by G.B. Bronzini) In the second half of the 19th century research carried out by Italian folklore scholars was influenced by the positi- vist theories of Cesare Lombroso and Paolo Mantegazza. On the other hand the positivist anthropologists too di- splayed interest in folk medicine (the Neopolitan school in particular revolving around the journal (&lt;L'anomalo))) and they in fact established a link between criminal anthropo- logy and folk medicine: the practicing of folk medicine with a magical and superstitious or empirical background was regarded as a harmful deviation and socially dangerous, much in the same way as, generally speaking, any manife- station of cultural diversity is considered anomalous. Infirmitas and religious therapy in a medieval town (Or- vieto, 1240). (by A.I. Galletti) An analysis is made of the evidence of the canonization pro- cess of the Franciscan Ambrogio da Massa who died in Or- vieto in 1240 having acquired the reputation of being a thau- maturgist. The purpose of the analysis is to identify pat- terns of the social perception of sickness in an urban envi- ronment in the early Middle Ages and, in relation to this, the development of a therapy based on religious concep- tions and values. From this analysis emerges a picture of &lt;&lt;infirmitas?&gt; as a decline in group security and confidence due to the weakness of a single component. Then there are the healing rituals as a means of re-establishing confiden- ce together with new and wider associations which, in the most complex cases, tend to coincide with the towndwel- lers' community itself. The saint's body, an object of worship, therefore comes to be seen as a privileged point of reference, space-wise and culture-wise, for the community of proteges. Traditions involving magic and ?folk medicine)) in a num- ber of 14th and 15th century treatises on agronomy (by F. Cardini) Metaphors based on the vegetable kingdom used to define our conditions of life and health date back to the long- standing link between man and plant life, almost a homo- geny, which ascribes anthropomorphic, sexual, health- giving or ill-fated qualities to the vegetable kingdom. Know- ledge of plant life in the Middle Ages drew on a (cultu- red&gt; tradition (from Cato to Pliny) and on folklore or folk- lorized cultural elements. These elements which lived on long after the Middle Ages are evidence of a folklore which in not static, but endowed with an internal vitality, open to enrichment and modification in a complex relationship of cultural transfer and exchange with the scientific and cul- tural realities of the different ages. Somnambulistic fortune-telling Folk mesmerism in Italy in 19th century (by C. Gallini) The author examines the phenomenon of somnambulistic mesmerism in Italy from half way through the 19th centu- ry until the period following the first world war. At this time mesmerism increased considerably in popularity in lar- ge towns and developed mainly in two directions: as a form of entertainment with experiments which were extremely popular and were held first in the main theatres and later in the squares in outdoor performances; the other direc- tion in which the phenomenon expanded was with the therapeutic-oracular trend which led to the opening up of numerous mesmerism consulting rooms, the forerunners of the healers and fortune-tellers found today in the towns. Ineffectually persecuted by the church, which considered the practice a dangerous superstition, and fiercely oppo- sed by the positivistic scientists (and in particular by the Lombrosian school) which branded all practices outside the 173</page><page sequence="2">framework of officinal science as fraudulent and faked, me- smerism formed a significant cultural response to the need for assurance, &lt;((oracles&gt;&gt; of the new lower social classes crea- ted through the urbanization process which followed the unity of Italy. The disputed body. &lt;Official&gt; medicine and &lt;Folko medi- cine in Magione (Perugia) (by P. Bartoli and P. Falteri) Research into traditional folk medicine can all too easily be restricted to the compilation of static reports of beliefs and customs, isolated and seemingly impervious to the pe- netration of official medicine. This can occur in much the same was as historical research on the structure and wor- king of the public health organization can come to mean just the study of medical action as merely a technical and scientific intervention rather than the conveyor of patterns of behaviour and knowledge too. A merging of the two fields of enquiry - traditionally and persistently detached from one another - in essential in order to reconstruct the overall process of cultural circulation where the meeting/di- spute occurs between official medical knowledge and folk culture. This merger is also vital in order to identify the concrete processes of hegemony and change which have af- fected the concept of health and illness, normality and ab- normality, among the lower classes. The article describes the project and methods of the research which starts from the Unity of Italy and focuses its attention on one village on Lake Trasimeno in Umbria. The research uses records and bibliographical sources as well as interviews with prac- titioners and patients in order to outline the fitful and in- consistent dynamics of acceptance and rejection as the pea- sant world is confronted with the patterns of knowledge and practice in the world of official medicine. Witches and elves. Differing strategies in determining ma- gic powers (by G.C. Barozzi) Is it feasible to analyse on the same level and using the sa- me criteria accusations made against human beings of witchcraft and beliefs in the evil deeds of spirits and elves? A correlation between the contents of accusations and be- liefs with the social role of the victims and their relation- ships with the group enables an assessment to be made of the differing strategies of behaviour on an idealogical pla- ne, though they are not unrelated when considered from a social point of view. A classification table with the diffe- rent types of magic aggressors helps simplify the analysis. Men and worms. Medico-magical beliefs and practice in Sicily (by E. Guggino) The work covers the results of research carried out in Sici- ly on &lt;&lt;worms&gt;&gt;, or rather on a number of forms of intesti- nal parasite found mainly in children. The research also deals with the ideology of the disease: the pathogenesis of the therapy. It was found that the &lt;&lt;scantu? (Sicilian for &lt;&lt;fright&gt;, &lt;&lt;shock&gt;) brings about a disorder in the organism with consequent agitation of the worms which are still pre- sent, physiologically speaking, yet harmless as long as they are confined to what is thought of as their normal posi- tion, in the intestine. The therapeutic treatment practised by the ociarmavermi)' includes objective remedies and ma- gic spells, &lt;&lt;orazionib, within the framework of an overall conception of the organism as a psycho-physical entity and, therefore, of the sickness as a disturbing element on both a physical and mental level. The charismatic therapies. Folk medicine and modern scien- ce (by V. Lanternari) The belief held by some authors that with the development and spread of official medicine as a science through all le- vels of society including the lower classes (and among tech- nologically backward cultures) the old beliefs and medical remedies founded on factors of irrationality have disappea- red is, in the author's opinion, in direct conflict with the actual situation in medicine as seen by the masses today. The author notes that the old customs and methods of treat- ment based on non-scientific assumptions have not lost any ground whatsoever in the group as a whole, rather they have spread and increased in popularity so that a number of re- medies and cures based on principles which are far remo- ved from those accepted by official medicine are definitely on the increase in modern society despite all the develop- ments in science and technology. These remedies and hea- ling cures also include the considerable space afforded to the &lt;&lt;charisman brand of experience and knowledge, i.e. group healing with religiously inspired personages and hea- lers who either work within the framework of the catholic or pentecostal tradition or by basing their beliefs on orien- tal religions through gurus and leaders inspired with thau- maturgical powers who proclaim idealogies of salvation from all evil. The author therefore expands the traditio- nally recognized dichotomy of &lt;&lt;folk medicine&gt;&gt; and ((offi- cial medicine&gt;&gt; to raise the question of the relationship bet- ween &lt;alternative medicine)) and ?official medicine&gt;&gt;. Written charms: a comparative outlook (by G.R. Cardona) Written charms for therapeutic purposes are to be found all along a wide continuous area from the Mediterranean basin to the Far East, with no major difference among their relevant features. The aim of this paper is to collect evi- dence for their distribution and to suggest a simple perfor- mative-based scheme to account for their operational principles. (&lt;Sorcerers and healers?&gt;. Television enquiry into the &lt;be- lief in magic&gt;&gt; in towns (by R. di Vincenzo and G. Tavano) Between December 1979 and October 1980 the authors car- ried out a sociological and anthropological enquiry through television into sorcerers and healers working in the town of Pescara, its outskirts and the country area just outside the town. The enquiry examined the vast and contradicto- ry procedures involved in the social and cultural changes 174</page><page sequence="3">taking place in the area and brought to light the interwo- ven persistence of a traditional country &lt;belief in magic) with the development of &lt;illogical magic&gt; feelings and prac- tices. This was supported by special publicity campaigns and broadcast through mass media channels. The develop- ment of these beliefs in the town seems to be coherent with the numerous and different forms of crisis and anomy so typical of town life today. The work outlines the hypothe- sis which served as a starting point and the research me- thods used, the results obtained and the structure of the three television programmes broadcast in February 1981 by the Abruzzo Regional Studios of the Italian Radio and TV Company, third channel, where the outcome of the initia- tive was given. Religion and healing (by R. Lionetti) Religion and therapy are frequently to be found associa- ted in popular practices and beliefs. The essay points to tho- se aspects of this relationship, which come out particular- ly in the most recent French scientific production. The re- port is therefore focused on: the cult of saints, the figure of the priest-doctor, the symbolic efficacy and the process of recovery, the therapeutic cults-space-and-time relation- ship, the permanence of such practices in urban contexts and finally, the relationship between therapeutic cults, of- ficial religion and social classes. The other Europe (by A. Signorelli) Taking the specific case of Italy's Mezzogiorno in relation to Europe and its history, Galasso raises a number of inte- resting problems connected with the relationship between Historiography and Anthropology. The question of conti- nuity/discontinuity lies at the heart of the problem of what enables a historic event to be defined (other than,. The answer is that the identification of a phenomenon comes through the relationships which integrate it within its con- text. The author accepts this approach but underlines cer- tain differences of opinion on the interpretation of the re- lationship between phenomenon and context. Whereas Ga- lasso claims it is a question of recognizing the procedures involved in the specific determination of the ocategories hu- manity can be considered under)&gt;, the author believes in the importance of identifying the network or structure of the relationship and common definitions characterizing a si- tuation. These networks or structures appear to be the right area to work on for the development of comparative pro- cedures. The long duration and short memory (by 'G.C. Barozzi) An assessment of the achievements of Gianni Bosio ten years after his death through a critical analysis of this po- sthumous work II Trattore ad Acquanegra (The Tractor at Acquanegra) and a discussion of contributions at the Man- tova symposium on working-class memory and new class structure. 175</page></plain_text>
