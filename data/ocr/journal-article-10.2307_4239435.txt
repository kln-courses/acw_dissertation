<plain_text><page sequence="1">266 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 8 (1981) Patrick A. McCarthy Star Maker: Olaf Stapledon's Divine Tragedy* 1. Brian Aldiss contends that "Star Maker stands on that very remote shelf of books which contains huge foolhardy endeavours, carried out according to their authors' ambitions: Hardy's Dynasts stands there, the writings of Sir Thomas Browne, C. M. Doughty's epic poems, and maybe Milton's Paradise Lost." ' In recent years, Star Maker (1937) has also come to occupy a space alongside other largely unread masterpieces. Like some other volumes in this class-Joyce's Finnegans Wake and Pound's Cantos are prime examples-Star Maker suffers from its somewhat exaggerated reputation for difficulty and is sometimes judged obscure because it does not give readers the sort of comfortable and familiar experience they often expect. Yet while Star Maker is certainly an unusual SF novel, the basic pattern of the book is an old and familiar one: the narrator journeys to other places (and other times), and his physical journey is a metaphor for the inner journey of discovery. In a sense, there are two main classes of travel novels, one in the line of Daniel Defoe (Robinson Crusoe, 1719), the other in the line of Jonathan Swift (Gullivers Travels, 1726). In Defoe's novel, Crusoe, shipwrecked on an island, transforms it into a sort of utopia that reflects all the values he has brought with him to the island; meanwhile, he himself remains fundamentally unchanged throughout the novel. The same pattern holds in Jules Verne's The M}ysterious Island, in which several Americans are stranded on a South Pacific island where, because of their high character and technological ingenuity, they are able to create an ideal community. On the other hand, in the Swiftian line of travel novels it is the traveller rather than the island that is transformed, so that Gulliver returns from his travels with a radically altered vision of man and society. In much the same way, Prendick returns to London at the end of H.G. Wells's The Island of DoctorMoreau (1896) and discovers that he can no longer see people simply as people: his experiences with the beast-men of Moreau's island have made him see all men and women as capable of reverting at any moment to their essentially bestial character. Like Wells's story and like such later SF novels as Pierre Boulle's Planet of the Apes (1963) and Ursula K. Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), Star Maker may be viewed as a product of the tradition of Swift, for Stapledon's narrator is an ordinary Englishman who undergoes an extraordinary adventure and returns drastically changed. The novel begins with the "I" of the book (he never names himself) sitting on a hillside at night and contemplating his life, his marriage, and the world. His sense of the "futility" and "unreality" of his life and his concern with "the world's delerium" lead him to pose fundamental questions about man's relation to the cosmos. In this state of mind the narrator feels himself leaving his body and beginning a mental journey through space and time * This chapter of a forthcoming book entitled Olaf Stapledon is copyright 1982 by Twayne Publishers, and used with the permission of Twayne Publishers, Inc., a division of G.K.

Later he travels to increasingly alien worlds with strange forms of intelligent life. As he goes along, he is joined by various alien mentalities, and together they form a cosmic mind which, in "the supreme moment of the cosmos" (13:223), sees clearly the nature of the Star Maker, the Prime Mover of the universe. From this high point in his journey, the "I" returns to Earth to face the problems of terrestrial existence fortified by the insight he has gained through his experi- ence. Star Maker most clearly recalls another famous journey, the travels of Dante Alighieri through the worlds of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise in the three books of his Divine Comedy. The darkness and confusion in the narrator's mind at the beginning of the novel suggest the opening of the Inferno, where Dante finds himself lost in a dark wood midway through his life. Stapledon puts it in his own terms: One night when I had tasted bitterness I went out on to the hill. Dark heather checked my feet. Below marched the suburban street lamps. Windows, their curtains drawn, were shut eyes, inwardly watching the lives of dreams. Beyond the sea's level darkness a lighthouse pulsed. Overhead, obscurity. (1: 11) Like Dante, Stapledon's narrator will move from the dark world of his soul to an all-encompassing vision of the universe and its creator. On the way he will not be guided by Virgil and Beatrice, but as he eventually discovers, his journey is directed by an advanced race on a distant planet; the various worlds he visits correspond roughly to the different parts of the three afterworlds visited by Dante. Yet as Robert Scholes has observed, the final vision of Star Maker is radically different from that of The Divine Comedy: "as Dante's vision was essentially comic because God cared for man, so Stapledon's is ultimately tragic, because the Star Maker cares only for creation and the critical contemplation of his creatures."3 It would be equally accurate to say that while Dante's vision is firmly rooted in the Christian concept of good and evil as absolute values, Stapledon adopts a more complex and morally ambiguous view of the force behind the cosmos: as we learn, the Star Maker transcends the categories of good and evil. The narrator, trapped by the limitations of his individual perspective, tries at first to understand the Star Maker as an embodiment of good or evil, but as other cosmic explorers join the quest, we come to see the Star Maker in altogether different terms. 2. As in Last and First Men, where the First Men are given a disproportionate amount of attention, the extraterrestrial race subjected to the closest examina- tion in Star Maker is the one most like us. The "Other Earth," populated by "Other Men," provides Stapledon with an opportunity to exercise his satiric talents, for much of this section is a caricature of human behavior and man's institutions. At the same time, Stapledon's ability to create a coherent picture of a wholly new race shines forth here, as it does throughout Last and First Men. Stapledon bases much of his portrait of the Other Men on a simple biological distinction between mankind and the other mankind. In the process he shows us that to a large extent our view of the world is determined by our biological make-up. The major biological differences lie in the senses of sight, hearing, taste,</page><page sequence="3">268 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 8 (1981) and smell. Compared to us, the Other Men are deficient in two respects: they are not very sensitive to color, and they are tone deaf. As a result of the latter defect, "Music . . . never developed in this world" (3:38). But their senses of smell and taste are far more developed-and consequently more important-than ours: they taste with their hands. feet, and genitals as well as with their mouths, and every facet of their civilization is affected by the fact that their senses of taste and smell are more discriminating than their vision or hearing. The narrator observes, for instance, that while our language includes many words that originally had to do simply with vision, the pattern is quite different on the Other Earth: "our 'brilliant', as applied to persons or ideas, they would translate by a word whose literal meaning was 'tasty'" (3:39). This emphasis on taste inevitably colors (or, we should say, flavors) their concept of God, who is imagined as having a particularly delectable taste. Yet there is little agreement about what that taste is: Religious war had been waged to decide whether [God I was in the main sweet or salt, or whether his preponderent flavour was one of the many gustatory characters which my own race cannot conceive. Some teachers insisted that only the feet could taste him, others only the hands or the mouth, others that he could be experienced only in the subtle complex of gustatory flavours known as the immacu- late union, which was a sensual, and mainly sexual, ecstasy induced by contemplation of intercourse with the deity. (3:51 ) Besides travestying religious quarrels on Earth, this passage satirizes the anthropomorphism of terrestrial religions: while we tend to see God in our own image, the Other Men imagine that God shares their taste. Quarrels about religion, then, have their basis partly in "raice," for racial distinctions among the Other Men are "almost entirely differences of taste and smell" (3:39). Stapledon develops this relatively simple concept into a clever satire on racial discrimina- tion, class systems, and social snobbery. For instance, industrialization has produced a proletarian class, a "pariah race" whose taste and smell offend more fortunate people. Their inability to tolerate the pariahs is, the narrator says, an indication of "the secret guilt and fear and hate which the oppressors felt for the oppressed" (3:41), and it is clear that his commentary is meant to reflect on the relation of social classes on our planet as well. The satire takes another turn when we are told that many people use deodorants and degustatants to substitute a more fashionable or pleasing odor and taste for their natural flavor. There is, however, a catch: Unfortunately, though the taste of the limbs could be fairly well disguised, no effective means had been found for changing the flavour of copulation. Consequently newly married couples were apt to make the most shattering discoveries about one another on the wedding night. Since in the great majority of unions neither party had the orthodox flavour, both were willing to pretend to the world that all was well. (3:40) In a novel whose central theme (discussed later in this essay) is symbiosis and community, such an example of marriages based on hypocrisy and deceit is particularly devastating. As for the Other Men, their society is "rotten with neuroses bred out of these secret tragedies of marriage," and there is little hope that they will discard the class system that produces such a neurotic civilization. Like us, the Other Men have their communists and fascists, liberals and conservatives. They also have radio and television, which transmit smells and tastes as well as sounds and images. Much like the "feelies" of Brave New World, however, radio is intended partly to help control the' populace. By directly stimulating a person's brain with a "sexual receiving set," a broadcaster can give</page><page sequence="4">OLAF STAPLEDON'S DIVINE TRAGEDY 269 him a perfectly simulated experience of sexual union. When the same idea is applied to other areas, like dining and sports, politicians realize that they can use the invention to maintain power: "Slum-conditions could be tolerated if there was an unfailing supply of illusory luxury" (3:45).4 The invention is taken a step further when scientists make it possible for some people to spend their lives in bed experiencing simulated life through radio programs. At first it appears that Stapledon might be planning simply to inveigh against the disastrous conse- quences of living a passive life in a totally artificial technological environment- something in the manner of Wells's The Time Machine (1895) or E. M. Forsters "The Machine Stops" (1909)-but his real attack here is in another direction: while religious people, nationalists, and the "Other Fascists" condemn "radio- bliss" for the wrong reasons, Stapledon asks us to identify with those who object that radio-bliss retards "the creation of a world-wide community of awakened and intelligently creative persons, related by mutual insight and respect, and by the common task of fulfilling the potentiality of the human spirit" (3:48). In a sense, then, the real trouble with radio-bliss is that this technological advance comes at a time when the Other Men are too immature to handle it. and it therefore endangers their spiritual development. The combination of spiritual immaturity and technological sophistication, along with the emphasis on bigotry and the satire on unchecked capitalism, suggests again that this part of Star Maker has much in common with the "First Men" sections of Last and First Men. Another link with the earlier novel is that the Other Men are 'subject to strange and long-drawn-out fluctuations of nature, fluctuations which I last I for some twenty thousand years" (3:55); the cyclic rise and fall of their civilization recalls the history of man as he struggles to develop his society only to be set back repeatedly by unforeseen dangers, either from within himself or from outside Earth.5 On a larger scale, these cycles suggest the pattern of cosmic creation that the narrator later envisions: the Star Maker creates a series of cosmoses, allowing each to reach its potential and run down before being superseded by another. Here, the narrator sees the futile struggle of the Other Men toward awakening, and their constant slide backwards into barbarism, as evidence that "Hate must be the Star Maker" (3:61); but Bvalltu, an Other Man with whom he has made contact, regards the issue more dispassionately and argues that even a tormented existence deserves praise. Like the Last Men, Bvalltu is able to rise above his own condition and adopt a more cosmic perspective on the nature of human life. But that is not enough: to learn more, the narrator must travel again. 3. Although it is many other things as well, Star Maker is partly a satire on the mental errors that plague human culture and prevent the "awakening" that Stapledon always sought. The satire is particularly obvious in the Other Earth section, perhaps because that is the most conventional part of the book and therefore the part where it is easiest to suggest an analogy with terrestrial institutions, but the satiric element surfaces in other places as well. A brief example is the description of a world where a "cult of irrationalism" takes over (5:87-88). People begin to admire "brute-men," and despotic and brutish leaders rise to power in many countries. Meanwhile, women so desire to have children fathered by these men that they willingly pay to be fertilized by them, either through artificial insemination or through intercourse. It is bad enough that the business becomes commercialized in the "democratic" countries, but in totali- tarian societies the situation is even worse. There, "a tyrant of the fashionable type gathered upon his own person the adoration of the whole population. He was the god-sent hero. He was himself divine. Every woman longed passionately</page><page sequence="5">270 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 8 (1981) to have him, if not as a lover, at least as father of her children." In some places the leader "condescended to be the father of the whole future population' through artificial insemination. The results are catastrophic: the level of intelli- gence among the populace declines drastically, the race descends to the level of barbarism, and eventually the people are exterminated by a "rat-like animal" which they are no longer intelligent enough to defend against. On its more obvious level, this section may be read as a warning against allowing the irrational element in all of us to dominate our culture. In this sense, the brute-men, who are roughly equivalent to Swift's Yahoos, represent exactly what they are: they personify the anti-intellectual, subhuman element in man's culture, the most obviously destructive aspect of what, in Last Men in London, Stapledon calls our "simian" nature. But it is on the level of contemporary history that this section is most effective, for the rise of the brute-men is an allegory for the rise of fascism in Europe and of the "mob mentality" elsewhere in the 1930s. In particular, the swaggering figure of the "mob-controller" who is worshipped by his half-crazed followers suggests Mussolini or Hitler, while the use of artificial insemination to produce a more brute-like race parodies Nazi attempts to "purify" their race.6 (Since official Nazi propaganda depicted the Slavs, Jews, and some other "non-Aryan" groups as subhuman, part of the satire here derives from treating the Nazis themselves as subhuman.) More broadly, in dealing with the possibility of a fatal decline in human mentality, Stapledon is returning to a theme that appears in several of his other works. The destruction of the brute-men's culture by rats, in fact, anticipates one of the two possible ends of the human race outlined in Stapledon's next novel, Darkness and the Light ( 1942). Here, as in that book, the end of the race is appropriate, for the rats represent the element of self-destructive bestiality that becomes intricately woven into the fabric of the race. A more elaborate reference to fascism appears in a later part of the novel, where Stapledon describes the rise of "mad" or "perverted" worlds. These are fairly advanced, even "awakened," worlds that become obsessed with interstellar travel. Filled with "missionary zeal," they insist on converting other races, and when they are rebuffed they try to destroy the other worlds. Eventually a "League" is formed to resist the "United Empires" of the mad worlds, but the sane worlds find themselves at a disadvantage because their democratic systems make them far less efficient than the military dictatorships they face. More effective, for a while, are some highly developed pacifistic worlds that use telepathic hypnosis to destroy the "communal mind" or group mentality of the invaders. Unfortunately the result is that the United Empires decide that "cer- tain seemingly pacifistic worlds larel in fact more dangerous than all other enemies" (9:161) and determine to destroy them by causing their suns to explode. After three such disasters, however, an even more developed race uses its telepathic powers on the United Empires. The narrator describes the nature of this power: It could dispense with the aid of normal intercourse, and it could overcome every resistance. It could reach right down to the buried chrysalis of the spirit even in the most perverted individual. This was not a merely destructive power, blotting out the communal mind hypnotically; it was a kindling, an awakening power, brought to bear on the sane but dormant core of each individual. (9:170-71) The result is a triumph, but a mixed one, for while many of the mad worlds are transformed into truly awakened races, others descend to barbarism or commit suicide. This sequence may be interpreted in a number of ways. At heart, it is an</page><page sequence="6">OLAF STAPLEDON'S DIVINE TRAGEDY 271 attack on what, in Waking World, Stapledon calls "the mechanic's mentality."7 Since Stapledon criticized Russia as well as the capitalistic countries for "'sacrificing at the mechanic's shrine," Curtis Smith is undoubtedly right to suggest that in the mad world episode "Stapledon is satirizing what he conceives to be the U.S.S.R.'s mania for industrial development to the exclusion of the quality of life."8 But the references here point more directly to the menace of fascism than to the flaws in the Russian system: the failure of the League to stop the mad worlds, for example, suggests the inability of the League of Nations to cope with the expansionist policies of Japan, Italy and Germany in the 1930s. The defeat of the pacifistic worlds, on the other hand, does not indicate that Stapledon was abandoning his allegiance to pacifism, only that he realized that pacifism alone would not stop the march of a Hitler. What is needed, he seems to say, is a genuine transformation of the spirit, something he is able to produce here only through the deus ex machina intervention of a race with advanced telepathic powers. Perhaps the most ingenious and most successful political and social satire in Star Maker may be found in the description of the world of the Nautiloids, mollusc-like beings that evolve into something very close to the shape of a ship. Taking a page out of Wells's The Time Machine, Stapledon describes "the splitting of the population into two mutually unintelligible castes through the influence of economic forces" (5:93). The two classes here are radically differ- ent, both physically (the masters are delicate, like Wells's Eloi, and the workers like the Morlocks are hardy) and mentally (the masters tend to be "Prudent, far-seeing, independent, self-reliant" while the workers are generally more altruistic and less individualistic-5:94). Yet social class in this world is deter- mined not by parentage but by what side of the mother one is born on: After weaning, all children born on the port side of the mother, no matter what the parental caste, were brought up to be members of the master caste; all those born on the starboard side were brought up to be workers. Since the master class had, of course, to be much smaller than the working class, this system gave an immense superfluity of potential masters. The difficulty was overcome as follows. The starboard-born children of workers and the port-born children of masters were brought up by their own respective parents; but the port-born, potentially aristo- cratic children of workers were mostly disposed of by infant sacrifice. (5:94) From this premise, Stapledon develops a sophisticated and ironic com- mentary on the "nature-nurture" controversy, the argument over whether hered- ity or environment is the more important determinant of intelligence and personality. In a development reminiscent of Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson,9 some port-born (master class) infants are brought up as members of the working class and become in every respect like the workers born on the starboard side; this causes capitalists, who see the potential benefits of increasing the number of workers, to develop moral qualms against infanticide. Oddly enough, the indus- trialists do not seem to foresee the obvious corollary: as scientists soon discover, '"starboard-born children brought up as masters developed the fine lines, the great sails, the delicate constitution, the aristocratic mentality of the master caste" (5:95). The result of these discoveries is that the world is split between the forces of revolution and reaction: in one part of the world there is a communist dictatorship that promises a classless society, while in other parts there is fascistic reaction against "materialistic science" and the emergence of a dictator along the lines of Hitler or Mussolini. The struggle of these two forces devastates the civilization of the Nautiloids and reduces them to "almost subhuman savage- ry," but in time the race rebuilds itself and develops a higher and saner civiliza- tion.</page><page sequence="7">272 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 8 (1981) Like other sections of Star Maker, this one combines satiric commentary with thematic development. In this episode Stapledon takes sides in the nature- nurture argument, showing that environment is actually the sole determinant of the Nautiloids' physical and intellectual development. The section also attacks capitalistic industrialism and argues that the profit motive, if unrestrained, may lead to moral bankruptcy. Finally, the whole sequence is related to the world- situation in 1937 through references to the development of communism and fascism and the inevitability of war between these two ideologies. Beyond all of this, however, the episode is thematically significant in quite a different way. Throughout the novel, one of Stapledon's most important themes is "symbiosis" or "community"; building on a foundation of cooperation and ieespect for one another's individuality, certain races create utopian societies and "awaken" into a higher state of spiritual awareness. A world like that of the Nautiloids, in which the race splits into two sub-species and one exploits the other, is therefore the antithesis of the ideal world of true cultural and spiritual development. This is why the war between the revolutionaries and the reactionaries is unavoidable: the civilization of the Nautiloids is so grossly perverted that it cannot be reformed but must be destroyed and then rebuilt. There is evidence elsewhere in Star Maker that Stapledon saw our situation on Earth as more hopeful, but it is undeniable that the Nautiloid episode gives us a very dark view of man's spiritual crisis. 4. On the opening page, the narrator of Star Maker refers to his relationship with his wife: I distinguished our own house, our islet in the tumultuous and bitter currents of the world. There, for a decade and a half, we two, so different in quality, had grown in and in to one another, for mutual support and nourishment, in intricate symbio- sis. (1:11) Throughout the book, this symbiotic relationship-described variously as "this indescribable union of ours," 'the little jewel of personal union," and at the end. our little glowing atom of community" -is recalled. Stapledon is thinking of his own marriage to Agnes Miller, but the autobiographical basis of the narrator's marital situation is far less important than the thematic relationship of this marriage to the rest of the novel. Stapledon turns the idea of symbiosis into the central metaphor of the book; in addition, the narrator's vision of the Star Maker is made possible by another kind of symbiotic relationship. The narrator sees that his marriage is "a microcosm of true community" and "an actual and living example of that high goal which the world seeks" (1: 12). The ultimate example of symbiosis will go far beyond the world, howev- er, for the evolution of the cosmic spirit in quest of self-knowledge is the apotheosis of symbiotic community. Along the way, the theme surfaces in virtually every part of the book, but the clearest instance of it is in the "symbiotic race" of "lchthyoids" and "Arachnoids." These two distinct species, both of them intelligent, develop on the same planet, with the fish-like Ichthyoids controlling the seas and the crab-like Arachnoids ruling dry land. At first they see one another merely as rivals or even as enemies, but later they enter into a partnership that evolves into "biochemical interdependence" ('7:105). At this point a complex pattern of interspecific pairings develops: adolescent Ichthy- oids and Arachnoids each take life-long partners of the other species, and these pairings are to them more important than the sexual matings with members of their own species, nece.ssary for the propagation of each race. Although the symbiotic pairings are primarily mental, they also have sexual overtones since</page><page sequence="8">OLAF STAPLEDON'S DIVINE TRAGEDY 273 they always involve a male and a female, the male acting "with parental devo- tion" toward his partner's offspring. More importantly, the relationship of the two species allows them the advantages of specialization without its drawbacks: the Ichthyoids are superior in theoretical, and the Arachnoids in practical, matters, yet the close mental and emotional bonds of the partners allow each to participate in the achievements of the other. The narrator says that before the planet became mechanized, the two races avoided "the cleavage into masters and economic slaves" because "the communal spirit ... triumphed over all individualistic enterprise" (7:107). The communal spirit, however, is threatened when the Arachnoids learn how to produce fire; they quickly put the world through an industrial revolution while their aquatic partners, unable to make use of fire, resent their own increasingly subordinate status. The- conflict leads to tension, war, and even attempted genocide before enlightened members of both species are able to reconstruct the symbiotic bond that lies at the heart of the matter. Two later developments ensure the continuation of the relationship: they find a way "to establish full telepathic intercourse between the two members of each couple" and eventually among the whole race, and the brain capacity of the Ichthyoids is increased so much that they can maintain an equal relationship with the Arachnoids despite their limited practical abilities. Now both species can develop their special talents. The Arachnoids explore space, returning periodically to visit their partners, while the Ichthyoids create "a fixed network of ... individuals in direct neural connection with one another"-in short, a huge brain consisting of all the Ichthyoids on the planet (9:166). In so doing, they become the first of the 'minded worlds" which together develop into the cosmic spirit. In some ways, the Symbiotics are the most important race in the galaxy. Once they have "awakened" they assist other races in reaching their own level of development, so that they are largely responsible for the growth of the galactic, and then the cosmic, mind. They are also the race that initiates and guides the journey of the narrator and other cosmic explorers, and when the United Empires threaten to destroy saner races, the telepathic powers of the Symbiotics end the menace. As an allegory of human development, the two species suggest man's divided (but potentially unified) nature: the Ichthyoids embody the theoretical, mystical, and introverted aspects of our being, while the Arachnoids represent our practical, rational, extraverted selves. The crisis in their history, when the discovery of fire allows the Arachnoids suddenly to overshadow the Ichthyoids, occurs during a time analogous to our present century, a time when man's technological and scientific genius has developed too quickly for him to be able to cope with the fruits of his technology. More broadly, however, the pattern of development of the Symbiotics is a miniature version of the history of the cosmos, as the intelligent life of the universe begins in isolated confusion, reaches out tentatively for other forms of itself, suffers setbacks, and finally breaks through into a lucidity made possible only by cooperative effort. The communal theme is seen in other terms elsewhere in the book. Some of the complications of the theme are indicated by the portrayal of a society of "Human Echinoderms." In this race there is a struggle between the individual and the group-a struggle in which, because of biological and social factors, the independence of the individual is threatened. The Echinoderms reproduce at certain times when the entire tribe emits a fertilizing "pollen," so that "Every child, though it had an individual as its mother, was fathered by the tribe as a whole" (5:83). Because children are raised "communally," and because the tribe is the only "lover" the individual Echinoderm ever knows, there is a tendency for individuality to become suffocated by the group. A reaction against this herd-</page><page sequence="9">274 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 8 (1981) instinct takes the form of a "religion of self," but the religion is unsuccessful because "the precept 'Be true to thyself,' bred the disposition merely to be true to the tribal fashion of mentality" (5:85). Stapledon may be suggesting the danger of the suppression of individuality in communist and fascist countries, but it is equally important to see that the culture of the Echinoderms is a mirror image of Stapledon's vision of capitalistic societies where each man respects his own individualism but denies the right of others to be truly different -as he says, '"The precept, 'Love thy neighbour as thyself,' breeds in us most often the disposition to see one's neighbour merely as a poor imitation of oneself, and to hate him if he proves different." Thus the growth of world government would be a valuable corrective to our selfish individualism, while for the Echinoderms it poses the threat of complete obliteration of the individual. The supreme example of communal enterprise may be found in the growth of the cosmic mind. As he is joined first by Bvalltu and then by other mental explorers of the universe, the narrator becomes part of a great mind that can understand much that, by himself, the narrator could never have understood. Yet this experience-much like the racial experience of Last and First Men- does not obliterate the individuality of each member of the group: In one respect, namely unity of consciousness, we were indeed a single experiencing individual; yet at the same time we were in a very important and delightful manner distinct from one another. Though there was only the single, communal 'I', there was also, so to speak, a manifold and variegated us'. an observed company of very diverse personalities, each of whom expressed creatively his own unique contribu- tion to the whole enterprise of cosmical exploration .... (8:134-35) The same pattern holds, on a wider scale, when "minded worlds" join in a galactic community. Still later it is discovered that the stars themselves have a form of intelligence, and after many difficulties "a symbiotic society of stars and planetary systems embraced the whole galaxy" (11:206). And, when the galactic mind makes contact with other galaxies, the "cosmic mind" emerges. It is this mind that explores its own past, communicating with the giant nebulae from which the galaxies developed, and later explores past cosmoses. In the "supreme moment" of the cosmos, the cosmic mind envisions its creator, the Star Maker. This vision is what the book has been pointing toward, and it is in a sense the raison d'e^tre for the theme of symbiosis throughout the novel. In a practical sense, the vision attained in this book is supposed to be far beyond the imagina- tive grasp of any one of the cosmic explorers, but together they can see something which the English author of the book dimly remembers and writes down in terms that we can understand. But in another sense, the question asked at the beginning of the book is implicit in the whole journey. Is the principle of love and mutual understanding-the symbiotic relationship exemplified by the narrator's marriage-a fundamental law of the universe, something implicit in the created cosmos and therefore reflective of the mind of the Star Maker, or is it perhaps totally insignificant, a sentimental notion unsanctioned by the blind, indifferent cosmos'? To put the question another way: will there be anything to see at the end of the journey, and if so, can we praise it? Or, to state it most simply: does our life have meaning in relation to the cosmos? These are questions that Olaf Stapledon first posed in Latter-Dav Psalms (1914) and struggled with throughout his life. In the vision of the Star Maker, Stapledon proposed an answer. 5. The truly incredible scope of Star Maker becomes apparent only in the latter half of the book. Here, the entire two billion year history of man that is</page><page sequence="10">OLAF STAPLEDON'S DIVINE TRAGEDY 275 recounted in the three hundred or more pages of Last and First Men is reduced to a single paragraph (10:185). Stapledon widens his lens even further, though, for his vision will eventually encompass not only the entire history of the cosmos-a matter of a few hundred billion years-but the histories of other cosmoses as well. The possible existence of sequential universes may take some getting used to, but it is crucial to Stapledon's conception of the Star Maker not as God, in the usual sense, but as the supreme artist, creating successive cosmoses until the ultimate cosmos expresses most perfectly the spirit of its creator. Our whole universe, as it develops, is only a rough draft-and not a particularly good one at that-for the final text of the ultimate cosmos. As the cosmic mind, the narrator follows the development of "spirit" in the universe. First he makes contact with the giant nebulae, then he races through the history of the galaxies until, long after they have passed their physical prime, the galaxies, and finally the cosmos itself, awaken into a great telepathic com- munity. It is this community that envisions the Star Maker. The narrator sees the Star Maker "in two aspects: as the spirit's particular creative mode that had given rise to me, the cosmos; and also ... as the eternally achieved perfection of the absolute spirit" (13:224). The two aspects of the Star Maker's being explain why the Star Maker creates not out of love-or, for that matter, hate-but out of a need to objectify its qualities so as to know its potentiality. The Star Maker, that is, creates for much the same reasons that the cosmos explores itself and .'awakens." The narrator, in his role as the cosmic consciousness, does not of course actually see the Star Maker. Rather, he envisions the creator in a dream-a mystical vision that is our nearest possible approach to direct apprehension of the unknowable. In the dream, then, we see the Star Maker first as an "infant" with "unexpressed potency" (15:236). He creates a "toy cosmos, a temporal rhythm, as it were of sound and silence." After this, each succeeding cosmos is created in response to the Star Maker's experience of the previous ones. They become more complex and, from our point of view, more fantastic: we are asked to imagine universes without space or without time; musical cosmoses; uni- verses in which our laws of gravity and entropy are reversed; and many other strange possibilities. Eventually the Star Maker conceives the divine and satanic aspects of his being and makes them the fundamental principles of a series of cosmoses. In one of these, there are actually three separate universes corres- ponding to the Christian Earth, Heaven, and Hell; those who are tempted by the Star Maker's "evil" aspect are doomed to eternal pain, while those who resist are rewarded with "an eternal moment ... of ecstatic comprehension and worship" (15:243). Later, with Hell overpopulated and Heaven virtually empty, the divine or "good" part of the Star Maker becomes incarnate "to redeem the sinners by his own suffering" (15:244). After seeing these earlier cosmoses, the narrator is able to watch the fashioning of our own universe, viewing it "not from within the flux of the cosmical time" but "in the time proper to the Star Maker" (15:247-48). It is from this perspective that he learns to praise the Star Maker. This urge to praise is one of the most paradoxical qualities of Stapledon's vision in this novel, for the narrator is also somewhat frightened of, and appalled by, the Star Maker's cold indifference to his creation. We praise the Star Maker-but we do not love him. In part, that is because one of the problems that leads the narrator on his journey, and continues to plague him to the end, is how to justify the pain and frustration that are so much a part of our lives and of life elsewhere in the universe. That pain continues-and in a sense is intensified-in cosmoses created after ours, even the "ultimate cosmos." Yet when the final cosmos faces</page><page sequence="11">276 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 8 (1981) its maker it, too, praises, and out of that praise is conceived the "absolute spirit" or perfect form of the Star Maker which he has striven to create (15:255). The passage is not easy to follow, but the idea seems to be that pain is a part of the Star Maker's being, much as it is part of any artist, and that in the end-as Pope, working from different premises, found-"Whatever is, is right."'0 The image of the Star Maker is also paradoxical in that it seems to be both an evolving and an unchanging and perfect spirit. Roger Brunet has commented on this apparent contradiction, arguing that Stapledon's concept of the Star Maker is an attempt to reconcile Aristotelian and Platonic ideas. Since each cosmos is a reflection of the Star Maker's current knowledge of itself, and since the creator seems to change in response to his creations, Stapledon is drawing on "Aristotle's conception of nature or reality as a process of becoming, combined also with Bergson's theory of an elan vital where nature ... evolves towards the perfect." But as Brunet notes, "In the second aspect the Star Maker is eternally perfect" in accordance with Plato's concept of the Absolute. " The paradox may be resolved if we observe that the Star Maker stands outside of time as we know it, and that in any case the Star Maker as creator is only one aspect of the eternal and unchanging spirit that it discovers itself to be. The real point, though. is that since these two aspects of the Star Maker simultaneously co-exist, so do the two aspects of his creation: the evolving worlds of flux and pain, and the final form of creation in which all is comprehended. In this way, the ultimate creation "redeems" all the others. 6. In the last part of the book, with the narrator back on Earth, Stapledon turns his attention from his great cosmic theme to the world of 1937. In his imagina- tion he circles the globe, seeing the war in Spain, the rise of fascism, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and America. He regards the world as an arena in which the forces of darkness and light-the "awakened" mentality and 'the cunning will for private mastery"-struggle. How, he asks, in the coming battle, can we preserve the "spirit's integrity" in ourselves? He gives two answers. First, there is love-"our little glowing atom of community." Besides this, there is the "hypercosmical reality" that he has discovered in his search for the Star Maker. He has reached the point where, as Brunet puts it, "loyalty to man and loyalty to fate are one."2 This is, in a sense, the justification for the book, a book that may initially seem to have no rele- vance to pre-war Europe. Stapledon's argument-advanced first in his Preface and reiterated in the last few pages of the book-is that his novel is not "a distraction from the desperately urgent defence of civilization against modern barbarism"; instead, he stresses the need for "'self-critical self-consciousness of the human species,' or the attempt to see man's life as a whole in relation to the rest of things" (1:7-8). In the end, "the rest of things" comes to include "the cold light of the stars," the light in which, because of its very indifference to us, we gain importance. Stapledon was neither an Existentialist nor an Absurdist, but the end of Star Maker is strikingly like that of Albert Camus' The Stranger (1942), where Meursault, condemned to death, lays his "heart open to the benign indifference of the universe" and in so doing finds that he is both free and happy.'3 The difference between Camus and Stapledon-and it is an important one-is that in Stapledon we see that we are not alone; that we are, or could be, part of the great movement and growth of spirit throughout the universe; and that our individual lives are redeemed when we rise out of and beyond ourselves and are absorbed into the whole. 7. Among the many papers that remained in Olaf Stapledon's library after his</page><page sequence="12">OLAF STAPLEDON'S DIVINE TRAGEDY 277 death was a 100-page holograph manuscript bearing the title "discarded MS. of Star-Maker." Discovered by Harvey Satty, the manuscript was first published in 1976 under the title Nebula Maker; today it is available in paperback. Although it is incomplete, Nebula Maker deserves study both for the light it sheds on the evolution of Star Maker and for its own value as a work of philosophical and speculative fiction. Near the beginning of Nebula Maker, the narrator, feeling "infuriated, and then utterly cowed, by the insensitiveness and vastness of the cosmos," believes that he sees the "immense and dimly lucent face" of God behind the stars (pp. 4-5).14 Soon, that face undergoes a series of changes that may simply represent the many ways in which men apprehend God; on another level, however, the changes parallel God's creation of a series of cosmoses leading to ours. Soon the narrator finds himself watching the creation of the universe, which is described in a style that parodies Genesis (pp. 12-15). The remainder of the novel, to the point where Stapledon abandoned the draft, describes the growth, social orga- nization, mentality, and eventual demise of the great nebulae. Many differences can be seen between Stapledon's methods here and in Star Maker. Stapledon originally planned to take his readers through the uni- verse in chronological order: thus the narrator visits the nebulae, and in later chapters he would have moved to the stars and then the planets. The structure of Star Maker, on the other hand, is almost the reverse: instead, the narrator first journeys to the Other Earth and other planets before discovering that the stars and even the nebulae are intelligent beings. Rather than following the evolution of intelligence and spirit in the order in which it occurred, Star Maker begins with the forms of intelligence that the reader can most easily comprehend and then moves on to other, more abstractly conceived, intelligences. Technically, then, the plot structure of Star Maker is more complex than that of Nebula Maker, but the reader finds it easier to suspend his disbelief in the narration if it begins with relatively familiar elements. Nebula Maker opens with the startling declaration that "I have seen God creating the cosmos, watching its growth, and finally destroying it." Throughout the short novel, Stapledon refers to the maker of the universe as "God," but in the later version the term "Star Maker" enables the author to avoid the orthodox religious terminology that might contradict the agnostic mysticism of his vision. The word "God" has far too many firmly entrenched associations for Stapledon to be able to use the word for his own purposes, but Stapledon is free to make the "Star Maker" into a figure that is neither good nor evil, neither God nor Satan, but simply the narrator's conception of the creative force behind the growth of spirit in the cosmos. In Star Maker, indeed, the narrator's realization that the term "God" is inadequate represents a major step toward the final vision of the novel. A further difference between the two versions of the novel may be detected in the narrator himself, for in Nebula Maker' the terrestrial narrator never relinquishes his individual identity, never joins in a group mind or cosmic mind. The effect of the change in narrative perspective in the later draft is twofold: it supports Stapledon's contention that his narrator is reporting a vision that is too complex for our limited mentalities, and it underscores the theme of community and symbiosis which is a major element in Star Maker' but not in Nebula Maker. Perhaps the most important, or at least the most obvious, of the differ- ences is that, as Harvey Satty puts it in his introduction to Nebula Maker, the nebulae in the original version have "a rich artistic and historical heritage," while in Star Maker the nebulae are "rather simpler primitive creatures almost unable to communicate with one another, and having no history" (p. viii). To put</page><page sequence="13">278 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 8 (1981) it slightlv differently: in Nebula Maker the nebulae are anthropomorphized to a great extent, while in Star Maker they are seen much more abstractly. It is easy to see that in treating the nebulae as human beings, even to the point of referring to some as "'recruiting sergeants" and others as "war-lords," Stapledon was not really trying to depict the nebulae in their own terms but was merely using them to satirize human society. When he rewrote the book and included many societies that were more like man's, he was able to shift some of the satiric elements originally associated with the nebulae into other sections of the novel. Thus, for example, the "Pan-Cosmical League" (pp. 83-84), a nebular version of the League of Nations, is transformed in Star Maker into the League that is set up to deal with the "mad" worlds. While most of the revisions are evidence of Stapledon's growing confi- dence in himself as narrative artist, the reader of Nebula Maker cannot help lamenting the deletion of one element from the revised version of Star Maker. That element is the portrayal of two exemplary nebulae who represent the saint and the revolutionary: Bright Heart, a pacifist whose life often follows the pattern of Christ's life, and Fire Bolt, a Marxist radical who attempts to inspire a cosmic revolution. The characterization of Bright Heart and Fire Bolt antici- pates Stapledon's description, in Saints and Revolutionaries (1939), of these two types of heroic individuals. The saint, he says, is concerned largely with improving man from within: the real revolution, according to the saint, must take place within the minds and hearts of individual people. Thus Bright Heart preaches a gospel of love, self-sacrifice, and pacifism. The revolutionary, however, realizes that "no ... widespread change of heart can be created by mere exhortation, and that we must begin by changing the structure of society."'- Accordingly, Fire Bolt argues that the old order must be destroyed by force before a spiritual revolution can succeed. He is persuaded by Bright Heart, however, to postpone action until the saint's methods have been fully tested. When the martyrdom of Bright Heart fails to transform the spirit of the cosmos, Fire Bolt tries his revolutionary tactics, but they too fail. The point seems to be that while Bright Heart and Fire Bolt each grasp an important part of the truth, neither type of person has a corner on the truth, and neither course of action will succeed by itself. Instead, as Stapledon says in Saints and Revolutionaries, the world can be transformed only when the saint is a revolutionary and the revolutionary is a saint.'6 Then, and only then, can we be assured that the social and political environment will reinforce the most "developed" values in each person, and that the human race will be awakened to the life of the spirit.

Stapledon Star Maker (1937) est sans doute une oeuvre de SF inhabituelle, mais elle suit cependant le patron d'autres voyages extraordinaires, tant celui de la Divine com&amp;die que celui des Voyages de Gulliver: le voyage cosmique du narrateur ano- nvme v' est la metaphore du vovage interieur de dccouverte spirituelle. Le narrateur traverse le temps et l'espace en quete d'une reponse aux problemes fondamentaux de 1 existence, ai savoir si I'existence de I'homme a une signification face ia limmense indifference du cosmos. Dans la mesure ou Stapledon etait convaincu que notre vie spirituelle est inseparable de notre milieu social et politique, Ia quete metaphysique du Faiseur dEtoiles implique l'explorateur dans l'etude d'autres mondes oiu la grande tdche de '-"Eveil" est selon les cas favorises ou retardes par les institutions socio- politiques. L 'element satirique du livre offre une transposition cosmique a' I'examen de diffetrents aspects de la situation mondiale en 1937 et sugge&amp;re que le fascisme, la societe de classes et "'"esprit de troupeau" sont les sympt6mes d'une volonte obscu- rantiste qui, ia travers le monde de son temps, s'affronte a la volonte de lumietres. A la difference de Dante, Stapledon evite la simple alternative du Bien et du Mal et la force creatrice derriere l'univers, le Star Maker, n'est pas cens&amp;e aimer sa creation, mais la contemple avec le regard objectif de I'artiste devant son oeuvre. Stapledon conclut que cette attitude critique et ataraxique face ia la creation ne veut pas dire que la vie humaine est depourvue de signification, mais que la responsabilite de faire progresser la vie spirituelle appartient a la seule humanite. A cet egard, les conclusions de Stapledon ressemblent ia celles de Meursault dans L'Etranger, pour qui "''indifference de lunivers" est condition de sa liberte. (PMC)</page></plain_text>
