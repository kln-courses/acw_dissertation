Archaeological discoveries testify that the foundations of ancient China's civilization were established in the advanced and flourishing Neolithic, an integral part of Chinese history. BACKGROUND Until the 1920S, lack of archaeological evidence led China to be thought to have had no Stone Age. With the accumulation of relevant data in that decade, the exis- tence of cultures of this period in China began to be firmly established, but poor conditions hampered the progress of archaeological work. By 1949 the Neolithic sites discovered throughout the country numbered only 300-400, of which those formally excavated were a tiny minority. The Yangshao culture, characterized by painted pot- tery in association with polished stone tools and origi- nally called the "Painted Pottery culture," was first re- vealed at Yangshao (Mianchi County, Henan) in 1921. Similar remains were subsequently discovered at a num- ber of localities in the upper and middle reaches of the Huanghe River. The discovery inspired a theory of cul- tural diffusion from the west, but this theory was soon disconfirmed by new finds. The Longshan culture, characterized by thin-bodied lustrous black pottery in association with polished stone tools, was first uncovered at Chengziya (Zhangqiu County, Shandong) in 1928 and named the "Black Pot- tery culture." Analogous discoveries were made in He- nan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Liaoning. In the beginning, the Longshan and the Yangshao were considered con- temporaneous, the first developing in the east and the second in the west. In 193 i, however, at Hougang (near Anyang City, Henan), Yangshao, Longshan, and Shang materials were found in stratigraphic sequence, re- vealing for the first time the relative dates of the two Neolithic cultures and the historical complex in the Huanghe River valley and, moreover, raising the ques- tion of the successive relationship of the Shang to the Longshan. From I906, the northern steppes from Northeast China through Inner Mongolia to Xinjiang had produced a number of complexes characterized by microliths, of- ten in association with potsherds decorated with comb marks or other patterns, that were long called the "Mi- crolithic culture." Along the Great Wall were found sites containing both microliths and polished stone tools in association with painted pottery, which some schol- ars assigned to a "Microlith-and-Painted-Pottery cul- ture." Since 1932, in the southeastern coastal region of China (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Taiwan, and Guangdong), numerous sites have yielded pottery with stamped geometric designs, often in association with the polished stepped stone adze or shouldered stone axe characteristic of southern China; these have generally been classified as the "Stamped Pottery culture." The insufficiency of archaeological data at the time made it impossible to draw any clear outline of the Neolithic in China. The character of some cultures was rather vague, and all the finds were assigned rather re- cent dates, shortening the course of China's Neolithic development. Missing links were common both region- ally and chronologically, and no comprehensive investi- gations could be undertaken. In a word, before 1949 Chi- nese archaeology was still in an embryonic stage. ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE 1949 Since 1949, thanks to widespread work and the massive accumulation of material, more than 7,ooo Neolithic sites have been discovered and more than 400 of them excavated, the most intensive work having been carried out in the Huanghe Valley and the middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang. As a result, the outline of the Neolithic in China has become quite distinct, and a number of early ideas have been corrected. Positive re- sults of great significance have also been achieved through the application of scientific concepts and tech- niques. For example, over I,000 C14 dates have been pub- lished so far (see, e.g., Institute of Archaeology I983), and much work has been done in thermoluminescence dating. These dates, combined with the results of ar- chaeological dating methods, have laid a solid founda- tion for the chronology of prehistoric China. In particu- lar, the relative and absolute dates of the Neolithic cultures in the Huanghe Valley and the middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang constitute a rather com- plete system (fig. I). Osteological research in physical anthropology, analysis of the chemical components, firing temperatures, and physical properties of pottery, identification of species of crops and domestic animals, and pollen analysis have provided important material for an understanding of the populations, technologies, pro- ductive activities, and natural environments of Neo- lithic China. The following paragraphs will briefly introduce the main archaeological cultures region by region (for fur- ther discussion, see An i982): The Huanghe River valley. It is in the valley of the Huanghe that the Neolithic remains known so far are the richest and that a number of questions have been resolved. Mesolithic complexes with microlithic tradi- tions are widespread, and breakthroughs have been made in research on the early Neolithic since the 1970S. The Peiligang culture of central Henan, the Cishan culture of southern Hebei, and the Dadiwan culture of the Weihe River valley in Shaanxi and Gansu are neighbours geo- graphically and have certain similarities. Their deposits are buried beneath layers of the Yangshao culture, and in cultural character they display a certain continuity with it; the Yangshao retains elements of these cultures in settlement distribution, architecture, burial customs, agricultural production, stone tool and pottery making, etc. All this strongly indicates that these three cultures</page><page sequence="3">Volume 29, Number S, December I988 | 755 Upper Middle Middle Lower Lower ___________ |Huanghe Huanghe Changjiang Huanghe Changjiang 1000 BC Bronze Siba Shang Shang Shang Shang Age----- ---- Qijia__ _______- - - - - - - - - 2000 BC Longshan Longshan Longshan Lagh Majiayao Qujialing 3000 BC Songze Dawenkou Majiabang I l Yangshao Daxi Li4000 BC Neoli thic - - Hemudu | F ---- ---- _Beixin --t 5000 BC | ffiadian Peiligang Cishan Zaoshi | _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 - _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ___ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ___ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _ _ __ 7 L 6 0 0 0 B C FIG. i. Chronology for the Neolithic and Bronze Ages of the Huanghe and middle-lower Changjiang. are among the forerunners of the Yangshao. C14 dates of 6000-5400 B.C. (approximately; in contrast, the C14 dates given below will all be dendrochronology-cali- brated) confirm their representation of a relatively early stage of the Neolithic in the Huanghe Valley. The culti- vation of foxtail millet, broomcorn millet, and rice was already advanced and pottery making progressive, in- cluding an embryonic painted ware. The Yangshao culture covers almost all of the middle reaches of the Huanghe and dates to ca. 5100-3000 B.C. Its sites fall into a number of different complexes chronologically correlated through stratigraphic and ty- pological studies and C14 dating. Painted pottery is one of the distinctive features of the culture. In the early phase it was characterized by simple designs; in the mid- dle phase, these became greatly complicated with in- creased stylization and the frequent use of human faces and animal motifs such as frogs, fish, birds, pigs, and deer; in the late phase the rare painted pots have pattems again painted simply and carelessly. The Yangshao culture was followed by the Longshan culture of the Central Plains. The discovery of the Miao- digou II culture, the early stage of the Longshan, has answered the question of the transition from the Yangshao to the Longshan, and the late stage of the lat- ter is represented by several complexes. In the beginning the Longshan was characterized mainly by gray pottery; a little later, the pottery-making wheel, black eggshell ware, and occasional copper objects appeared. The cul- ture dates to ca. 2900-2000 B.C. and stratigraphically falls between the Yangshao and the Shang. In the middle reaches of the Huanghe there is an obvious line of cul- tural succession from the Peiligang through the Yang- shao and Longshan to the Shang, and chronologically these cultures form a continuous chain (fig. 2). In the lower reaches of the Huanghe the main Neolithic complexes are the successive Beixin (ca. 5400-4400 B.C.), Dawenkou (ca. 4300-2500 B.C.), and Shandong Longshan (ca. 2500-i600 B.C.), cultures. The first two developed upon local bases and came into in- tensive exchanges with the Yangshao (for example, the Dawenkou has vessels of painted ware), while the third was the direct descendant of the Dawenkou and thus different in origin from the Longshan of the Central Plains. Its black eggshell ware, exquisitely made on the wheel, reached a high level of craftsmanship. The late stage of this culture is sometimes called Yueshi. In the upper reaches of the Huanghe, the Majiayao culture developed from the Yangshao and had four stages, Shilingxia, Majiayao, Banshan, and Machang, the chronological sequence and succession of which have been demonstrated both stratigraphically and typologi- cally. The culture dates to ca. 3400-2100 B.C. Resem- bling the Yangshao, it is distinguished by painted ware, but in shape and decoration the pottery has its own style. The following Qijia culture (ca. 1900-1700 B.C.) has certain similarities with the Longshan of the Central Plains, but its terminal date is later. The Qijia has pro- duced a number of small copper and bronze objects, indi- cating its more progressive character. In the Siba culture, a slightly later complex of the remote Gansu Corridor, bronze articles distinctly increased in number, the cul- ture having already stepped into the typical Bronze Age. The middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang River.

Radiocarbon dates for the Chinese Neolithic. Owing to the warmth and humidity of the climate, the prehistoric settlements here were largely based on rice farming. The Zaoshi culture of northern Hunan, a forerunner of the Daxi culture, goes back to ca. 6ooo-5200 B.c. and the Lijiacun culture of the southern foothills of the Qin- ling Mountains to ca. 5000-4900 B.c. At the same time there were settlements of the Yangshao culture in neigh- bouring areas. The Daxi (ca. 4400-3300 B.C.), Qujialing (ca. 3000-2600 B.C.), and Hubei Longshan (ca. 2400 B.C.) cultures occupied the banks of the Changjiang River and g,radually spreaqd over time.- In the, souithern Qinling the Changjiang, the most important is the Hemudu cul- ture, dated to ca. 5000-4000 B.C. and characterized by the remains of pile dwellings with tenon-and-mortise joints and vestiges of rice farming early in Asia. The following Majiabang (ca. 4300-3400 B.C.), Songze (ca. 3400-3300 B.C.), and Liangzhu (ca. 3300-2200 B.C.) cul- tures formed roughly a successive line and spread out along Taihu Lake, with their late complexes reaching the northern bank of the Changjiang. The Beiyinyang- ying and Xuejiagang (ca. 3200-3000 B.C.) cultures show a certain regionalism and chronologically correspond to the early Liangzhu. The idea of a Qingliangang culture, proposed in the I96os, has, because of its vagueness and the fact that the remains originally assigned to it have proved to belong to various cultural series of the Chang- jiang and Huaihe Valleys, been generally abandoned. Southeastern China. The early Neolithic complexes of Jiangxi, Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, and Guangxi are characterized by cord-marked pottery in simple shapes associated with chipped and polished stone tools, thus presenting a relatively primitive cultural character. Eco- nomically they were based on gathering, fishing, and hunting; no vestiges of rice farming have been found. In the limestone areas of southem China there is often a large margin for error in C14 dating, especially on shell, which may cause dates to be more than io,ooo years too early. Therefore the C14 dates for this region cannot be considered completely reliable. In the late Neolithic we see rice farming and rather progressive pottery making, including stamped ware. This period is represented by the Shanbei culture (ca. 2800 B.C.) in Jiangxi, the Shixia culture (ca. 2900-2500 B.C.) in Guangdong, and the Tan- shishan culture (ca. I300 B.C. for its middle complex) in Fujian. That the Fengbitou culture in Taiwan Province is very similar to the Tanshishan, especially in its painted pottery, suggests that by at least ca. 2000 B.C. people of ancient China had crossed the Taiwan Strait and created there a Neolithic culture of the same type as its mother culture. Southwestern China. In Tibet, Yunnan, and Guizhou there are only a few scattered finds of Neolithic age, roughly belonging to its late period, and their cultural affiliations and evolutionary sequences are as yet little known. At Karuo (Qamdo, Tibet), a settlement was un- covered with microliths in association with polished stone tools and pottery, including painted ware. The main crop there was foxtail millet. All this reflects quite a close connexion between this area and the Huanghe Valley. The site dates from ca. 3300-2I00 B.C. A settle- ment (ca. 2200-2I00 B.C.) was also found at Baiyangcun (Binchuan County, Yunnan), with abundant remains of rice. The northern steppes. In the steppes from the North- east through Inner Mongolia to Xinjiang, microliths are the most widely distributed relics and constitute the most striking similarity between the Neolithic com- plexes. However, as they existed in various periods and cultures, the notion of a microlithic culture has been replaced by that of a microlithic "tradition" for com- plexes in which such tools were used. Such complexes fall into two categories. The first was mainly based on</page><page sequence="5">Volume 29, ANumber 5, December I988 1757 gathering, fishing, hunting, and animal husbandry. Peo- ple led a nomadic life and left behind few clear cultural layers. No polished stone tools or pottery have been found among remains of this type. Economically, it should be included in the Mesolithic sphere, though some sites may be somewhat later. For example, Layihai (Guinan County, Qinghai), dated to ca. 5400 B.C., yielded no polished stone implements or pottery and roughly corresponds chronologically to the early farming cul- tures of the Huanghe Valley. The second category con- sists of agricultural settlements, mainly in eastern Inner Mongolia. Among its remarkable representatives are the Xinglongwa (ca. 6000-5500 B.C.), Xinle (ca. 5300-4800 B.C.), and Hongshan (ca. 3600-3500 B.C.) cultures, all with polished stone tools and some microliths as well as pottery decorated largely with comb marks. In the Hongshan, painted ware was abundant, implying a close connexion of the culture with the Yangshao. Moreover, the culture has yielded pottery female statuettes and, more striking, fragmentary life-size human heads and torsos from what have been identified as the remains of a temple at Niuheliang (Lingyuan County, Liaoning). The painted pottery vessels found in Xingjiang, far later than those of the Yangshao, roughly belong to the Bronze Age, thus exploding the argument that painted pottery diffused from the west. THE AGE-OLD CULTURAL TRADITION From the Palaeolithic through the Mesolithic to the "Neolithic revolution," human activities were increas- ingly widely distributed in ancient China. During the Neolithic, archaeological cultures of various types, ori- gins, and interrelations developed in different parts of China's vast territory, and through their exchanges with and influences upon each other new cultures sprang up one after another and expanded in their turn. In the Huanghe Valley, for example, settlements based upon farming came into being at least as early as the Peiligang, Cishan, and Dadiwan cultures; in the following Yang- shao and Longshan cultures, an agricultural economy made increasing progress, settlement grew denser, and people occupied wider and wider areas. What is espe- cially notable is that the cultures here represented a con- tinuous sequence and exerted a profound and lasting in- fluence on the surrounding regions. Beyond the Huanghe and Changjiang Valleys, early Neolithic complexes also emerged both in the northern steppes and in the south- eastern region, with agriculture developing while gath- ering-fishing-hunting retained a relatively important place. These constituted cultural sequences of their own and came into contact and merged with each other, pro- ducing a rich and colourful Neolithic picture. A bird's-eye view of the complexes of the late Neolithic reveals a tendency toward uniformity. For ex- ample, the pottery ding (tripod), gui (tripod with a lip spout), dou (long-stemmed vessel), gui (basin-shaped container), and hu (jar) are rather similar in style from one of these cultures to another, though there is some variety in shape, and the same can be said of stone tools. Therefore, the tendency toward fusion apparent in the cultures of late Neolithic China as a result of their mutual influence cannot be summed up in the term "Longshanoid culture." The Central Plains played a leading role in this tendency toward unification, based on a high level of development of the productive forces, and it was here that the Shang and Zhou civilizations first emerged. The rise of the agricultural economy. Despite the gaps with regard to the origin of agriculture and the pre- pottery stage in Neolithic China, there is no doubt that advanced agriculture and animal husbandry had devel- oped by 6000 B.C., with different types of farming reflect- ing local conditions. In the arid Huanghe Valley, for example, drought-resistant crops such as foxtail and broomcorn millet were widely planted and became the traditional crops of North China in historic times. Wheat became a crop in China only in the Bronze Age. The early domestic animals were mainly pig and dog, with fowl also being kept. The goat began to be raised in ca. 3000 B.C., perhaps introduced from western Asia. Ox, sheep, and horse began to be bred approximately in the late Longshan culture. In the warm, humid Changjiang Valley and the vast region to the south, rice, both long- grained and round-grained, was the main cultivated plant by at least 5000 B.C. Of the domestic animals of the time, apart from pig and dog, buffalo was the most char- acteristic. Very different from western Asia in species of crops and domestic animals, typology of farm tools, and productive practice, prehistoric China was doubtless a centre of the origins of world agriculture. Settlements and houses. With the development of the agricultural economy came large-scale settlements, varying in area from Io, 000 m2 to more than 100,000 m2, with numerous houses arranged in a definite plan and storage pits scattered among them. Settlements sur- rounded by moats existed as early as in the Xinglongwa culture; for the Yangshao, Jiangzhai (Lintong County, Shaanxi) is the most typical. Here a settlement covering an area of more than 50,000 m2 is surrounded by a defen- sive moat and has a central open space encircled by five complexes of buildings, each with a large house and some one or two dozen small houses clustered around it facing the space. Storage pits are grouped around the houses. To the east of the moat there are three cemeteries with adults' tombs; children's urn burials are scattered about the houses. From the late Longshan, rammed-earth and stone walls have been found, indicat- ing the emergence of the castle or some other kind of fortifications in this period. Houses were built chiefly of wood, and in general only their foundations are left. They often varied in shape and structure by region. In the Huanghe Valley the semisubterranean dwelling and the surface building were the main types, their max- imum area being about Ioo m2, and cave dwellings were built as well. Some Longshan houses had floors and walls plastered with lime, and at Taosi (Xiangfen County, Shanxi) lime layers were found incised with geometric patterns, implying attention to house decora- tion. In the Changjiang Valley and the region south of it semisubterranean houses were rare, the pile dwelling be- ing the most common type largely because of the high</page><page sequence="6">758 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY humidity and frequent rainfall. At Hemudu (Yuyao County, Zhejiang) a number of wooden piles and other, structural members, often with tenon-and-mortise joints, were found, and the largest house reached i 6 m2. These finds show that architecture in Neolithic China was highly developed. It is notable that artificial wells of the late Neolithic have been discovered with timber sup- ports within their walls and a number of water-drawing pots at the bottom. The introduction of the well testifies to progress in overcoming natural limits to create an effective means of improving living conditions and ex- tending the range of human settlement. Cemeteries and burial customs. The discovery of nu- merous tombs and examination of the evidence they provide of burial customs forms the basis for study of the evolution of social structure. In general, cemeteries were constructed near settlements, with burials densely packed and arranged in order, reflecting the governing role of kinship in the clan system. Burial customs were quite varied, although the single burial was for a long time the commonest. The multiple collective burials (including secondary ones) of the Yangshao culture may be a reflection of matriarchy, while the joint burials of a man with women (and sometimes also children) of the Dawenkou and Qijia cultures are believed to be burials of couples, a reflection of patriarchy. The difference in quantity of tomb furnishings may be a reflection of a distinction between rich and poor, but this requires con- crete analysis. For example, difference in kind and num- ber of grave goods can be seen in the Peiligang culture, with a few tombs even lacking any funeral objects; this is also the case with the Yangshao culture, in which some tombs were richly furnished. These differences should not, however, be considered evidence of property differentiation but rather attributed to the burial cus- toms of the time. In the Dawenkou and Majiayao cul- tures, in contrast, there are great differences in number of funeral objects and many richly furnished tombs, which must be linked with a distinction between rich and poor. The tombs of the Longshan cemetery of Taosi clearly reflect property differentiation. Here the large tombs were furnished with wooden coffins and many objects, incuding pottery plates with a dragon design, painted in red, wooden and crocodile-skin drums, stone chimes, etc., indicating that their occupants must have been chiefs. The medium-sized tombs also yielded abun- dant grave goods, while the small ones (some 90% of the total) were rather poor and sometimes even lacked fu- neral objects altogether. Despite the differences in social status of the occupants of tombs and the distinction be- tween rich and poor, the fact that members of a clan were buried close together within a cemetery (judging from the fact that the tombs are neatly arranged as is usual in Neolithic clan cemeteries and that the grave goods are in the same style) might be taken as a sign that the clan system was still fairly solid-that the society had not yet entered the state stage of class society. Pottery. Pottery making was introduced on the basis of settled agricultural life. Although the problem of the origin of ancient China's pottery has not yet been solved, it was in the Huanghe Valley that pottery production was most advanced. For example, the shaping of pottery vessels evolved there from hand building through re- touching on the turntable to forming on the wheel, and black eggshell ware, with its neat, thin body, reached a high level of craftsmanship. With the development of the pottery kiln from the horizontal type to the vertical one, firing temperature increased from 85o-95o0 C in the Peiligang and Cishan cultures to 900-I,000? C and sometimes as high as I,05o0 C in the Yangshao and Longshan. In the Changjiang Valley and the region south of it, pottery then was mainly handmade; the wheel and kiln emerged later. Similarly, painted ware made its first appearance in the Huanghe Valley. Stone tools and jade objects. Polished stone tools were the main implements of the time. They were varied in type and specialized in use. The axe, adze, yue (battle-axe), knife, sickle, spear, arrowhead, etc., exerted direct influence upon the bronze objects of the historic period. Chipped stone tools remained abundant through- out the Neolithic. With the rise of the agricultural econ- omy, the microlithic tradition rapidly died out in the Huanghe Valley, but in the northern steppes, with gathering-fishing-hunting and animal husbandry, it re- mained widespread for a long time. Jade lapidary began to flourish in the late Neolithic. The huang (a semicircu- lar pendant), jue (a penannular pendant), cong (a hollow tube, square outside and round inside in cross-section), bi (a flat disc), and the like were all handed down to the Shang and Zhou civilizations. The cong and bi of the Liangzhu culture are distinguished for both their ex- quisiteness and their standardization, the animal marks engraved on them having countless links with the taotie (monster masks) of Shang bronzes. These jade objects are mainly finds from large and medium-sized tombs and were of ceremonial use. Metallurgy. Copper objects began to be used in the late Neolithic; they appeared occasionally in the Longshan culture and became more common in the Qijia. In gen- eral, they are small tools or ornaments. In the Qijia, in addition to copper objects there were bronze ones, both forged and cast with single or composite moulds. The techniques were fairly primitive but represented the rise of the new art. In the Erlitou culture of the early Shang (ca. I900-I600 B.C.), the bronze jue (wine vessel), jia (tripod with thin hollow legs), etc., made their first ap- pearance. All this argues that the Huanghe Valley was the centre of origin of metallurgy in ancient China. Art and signs. Pottery painting flourished in the Yangshao and Majiayao cultures. The surfaces of vessels were burnished and painted with elaborate geometric patterns and vivid human faces and animal designs. Pot- tery painting was practised in a number of Neolithic cultures throughout the country but made its first ap- pearance and greatest progress in the Huanghe Valley. Alongside colourful painting there was clay applique; in the Yangshao culture, for example, pottery vases were decorated at the mouth with a lifelike applied human face. I have already mentioned the female statuettes and life-size heads and torsos of the Hongshan culture. In addition, skillful engravings are often seen on bone, horn, ivory, and wooden objects, including simple and</page><page sequence="7">Volume 29, Number 5, December I988 1 759 natural anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and geometric figures. It is remarkable that numerous single signs have been found on pottery vessels of the Yangshao, Ma- jiayao, and Dawenkou cultures. They have not yet been deciphered but may be among the prototypes of the an- cient Chinese writing system. PROSPECTS A number of problems remain to be solved. For example, little is known about the way the Mesolithic was trans- formed into the Neolithic in China and how Chinese agriculture and pottery making originated. A series of gaps remain to be filled in the chronology and succession of the Neolithic cultures beyond the Huanghe Valley and the middle and lower Changjiang, and comprehen- sive research is needed. The evolution from Neolithic to Bronze Age and the linking of archaeological finds with the legendary Xia Dynasty remain to be investigated in depth. More complete knowledge of Neolithic China will certainly be acquired with further archaeological research. References Cited AN ZHIMIN. 1982. Essays on the Neolithic of China (in Chinese).
