<plain_text><page sequence="1">367 Building Empire through Argumentation: Debating Salt and Iron in Western Han China Xiaoye You Globalization has ushered new challenges into American rhetorical education. When people, information, culture, and capital cross national boundaries, how are we going to prepare students to deal with civic issues that are both local and global? What do traditional goals of rhetorical education, such as citizenship and active civic life, mean in the context of globalization? American rhetoric teachers have focused on educating citizens for the democratic ideal, and for the achievement of equality across ethnicities, genders, and classes within the United States. However, imposing the same educational ideals on an increasingly globalized but unequal world could easily be viewed as imperialistic, as in the cases of Americans teaching English in the Philippines and China in the early twentieth century (Alberca; You, Writing). Such practices can only remind people of the hypo critical discussions in the U.S. political and diplomatic arenas over the past eight years. The United States brutally forced democracy on the Iraqis and the Afghanis without engaging these people in a democratic process, without trying to understand their ways of deliberation. Along with pedagogical and ideological challenges, globalization presents us with opportunities to reassess American rhetorical education, and to engage other traditions of rhetorical education and practices. In rhetorical studies, scholars have begun to examine the relationship between rhetorical education and imperialism, as in the studies of Cicero's and St. Augustine's discourses on Roman imperialism (Rose; Steel; Troup) and the study of Zitkala Sa's writings on native Indians' edu cation and American imperialism (Enoch). In composition studies, Bruce Horner Xiaoye Yo u is assistant professor of English and Asian Studies at Penn State University, University Park, where he teaches courses in rhetoric, writing, and the teaching of writing. He is the author of Writing in the Devil's Tongue: A History of English Composition in China (Southern Illinois, 2010). He is currently working on a monograph on rhetoric in early imperial China. Research for this essay was sponsored by the Center for Linguistics and Applied Linguistics, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, China. College English, Volume 72, Number 4, March 2010</page><page sequence="2">368 College English and John Trimbur, Min-Zhan Lu, and Paul Kei Matsuda have called our attention to the fact that for more than a century, U.S. college composition has been taught tacitly under the ideology of English monolingualism and the American nation-state. Suresh Canagarajah and I have addressed the ethical and pedagogical issues involved in the teaching of English writing in other multilingual nations (You, "Ideology"; Writing). Such scholarly efforts have allowed us to imagine new possibilities for rhetorical education in America. To further rhetorical education against the backdrop of American imperialism, we must move beyond the boundaries of the nation-state; we must look elsewhere, and we must examine other rhetorical traditions. Because China is making a strong presence in the global political, economic, and cultural arenas, rhetorical transactions in those areas will only increase among citizens of both nations. An understanding of the Chinese deliberative practice becomes a must for American rhetorical educa tors. In this essay, I examine the Chinese argumentative tradition, a tradition that has grown from two thousand years of the Chinese empire but remains largely un known to rhetoric scholars and teachers in the West. Specifically, I study a political debate in the Western Han dynasty (206 BCE-9 CE), an imperial state entangled in sociopolitical and cultural challenges not so dissimilar to those facing the United States today. By exploring argumentative practices and imperialism in a different tradition, we may better understand the challenges and possibilities in educating citizens of an increasingly globalized world. Political Debates in Ancient China Like Greco-Roman sophists, many eloquent individuals made a living from their oratory acumen in pre-imperial China. In the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period (770 BCE-221 BCE), the state of the Zhou dynasty crum bled, and small kingdoms formed. These kingdoms fought each other for political power and territorial control. Kings and lords recruited learned individuals to form advisory boards. These learned men (fit ru) argued with each other on astronomy, government policies, military strategies, and the righteous way of life. Vying for patronage encouraged competition among the literati. The liberal atmosphere in the intellectual field subsequently gave rise to the flourishing of a hundred schools of thought. Based on their scholarly training and philosophical orientations, the literati were later identified with certain schools headed by a few masterminds, such as Daoism under Laozi and Zhuangzi; Confucianism under Confucius, Mencius, and Xunzi; Mohism under Mozi; and Legalism under Han Fei and Shang Yang. As Arabella Lyon's piece in this issue illustrates, frequent debates and discussions between these schools allowed the literati to learn from one another about their worldviews, thoughts, and rhetorical strategies.</page><page sequence="3">Building Empire through Argumentation 369 After China became reunited in 221 BCE under the Qin, the first Chinese im perial state, the state continued to use debate primarily to solve political issues and to fill government positions. Literati, under the honorary titles of xianliang (jR virtue), fangzheng 0j]E righteousness), and wenxue (3C^ culture), were recruited by regional governments to advise the emperor on state affairs. Through court debates, those whose arguments the emperor favored would receive government posts. At least seventeen such court debates were held during the Western Han (Xu 451-52). In one of these advisory-board debates supervised by Emperor Wu in 134 BCE, Confucian scholar Dong Zhongshu argued that only the Confucian school of thought should be studied, and that other schools should be eradicated from the imperial academy (see You and Liu). Persuaded, the emperor established endowed positions for scholars of Confucian classics, who then recruited students to study under their tutelage. The classicists often debated exegetical issues in public and sometimes had to invite the emperor to resolve the dispute. Exegetical questions were never purely academic; in fact, they always overshadowed political decisions. The most noted scholastic debate took place in the Shiquge (&gt;jq!flKI) meeting in 53 BCE, where the classicists tried to resolve disputes surrounding all major Confucian classics (Xu 231-33). Because the Western Han laid a cornerstone for the state-sanctioned argumen tative tradition in imperial China (221 BCE-1911 CE), argumentative practices in this period warrant a close look. In the rest of this essay, I will examine records of a court debate that took place in 81 BCE, a few years after Emperor Wu's death. Emperor Wu implemented a series of centralized economic measures to support his territorial expansion, particularly to sustain wars with Xiongnu, a confederation of nomadic tribes from Central Asia. For example, the state monopolized salt, iron, and liquor industries; operated nationwide transportation facilities; and ran retail businesses. After the emperor died, the new emperor gathered his officials and more than sixty Confucian literati to reassess these measures. The consultation turned into a lengthy debate, not only on economic issues, but also on topics such as agriculture, border defense, diplomacy, legality, and Confucianism. The debate was later reconstructed under the title Yan tie fan [iSiSfpg Discourses on Salt and Iron] by a Confucian bureaucrat-scholar, Huan Kuan (year of birth and death unknown), who consulted both living debaters and historical record. The text delineates the debate in sixty episodes, spanning over several days. In each episode, the debaters focus on a specific issue that emerges during the debate. Like the U.S. presidential debates broadcast live on television and radio, each debater has about two minutes to elaborate his position on an issue before surrendering the floor to his opponent. After his opponent responds to and rebuts his arguments, he regains his turn to elaborate his position or to make new arguments. After a few turns, the debaters move on to another issue. Because Huan consulted the living debaters and</page><page sequence="4">370 College English probably experienced political debates of a similar kind himself, the debate format that he describes in Yan tie lun is historically accurate. To gain insights into rhetorical practices in the Western Han, I will conduct both content and rhetorical analyses. I will examine the primary text, Yan tie lun, as well as secondary sources on rhetorical practices before and during the Western Han. In particular, I will study the concepts used rhetorically by the debaters, their knowledge base, and practical challenges related to political debates in the empire. In terms of the concepts used rhetorically, I will focus on those identified by previ ous scholarship as typically Chinese, such as rectifying names; ritual; yin-yang; and non-action, which assumed a discursive prominence in the debate. My interest is to understand how these concepts were used in the context of the empire to advance the debaters' arguments. Through analyzing the debate, I suggest that political debates in the Western Han centered on the Confucian tradition but were also open to thoughts and con cepts of other schools. The debate provides us with an opportunity to understand how official-orators discursively engaged each other while representing diverse philosophical orientations, such as Daoism, Legalism, and Orthodox Confucianism. Despite Confucius's favorites, some concepts took on complex kairotical meanings as the debaters addressed the critical issues of building an empire. I argue that the inclusive attitude toward the thoughts and concepts of the Other was a proactive response to the multiethnic society that China had increasingly become. Further, my analysis of this ancient debate suggests that humanity, empathy, and responsibility should remain the key values in contemporary rhetorical education. The Discourse of the Officials Well before the consultation began, confrontation ran deep between the officials and the Confucian literati. The officials?as represented by Daifu Minister of Supervision San Hongyang?were historically labeled as Legalists (Liang). Al though the government did not officially endorse Legalism, as enforcers of state power, officials were favorably disposed toward Legalist thoughts and practices. Distrustful of the discursive power of individuals, Legalists resorted to the state law, or the institutionalized virtue, to regulate the people. Because most officials had worked with Emperor Wu, they continued to entertain an imperialist ideal for developing the Western Han. The literati fell into the Confucian camp, represented by the two archetypical figures Wenxue (culture) and Xianliang (virtue) in Yan tie lun. Coming from various parts of the country, they represented the voices of the people, particularly those of the landlords and merchants whose interests had been infringed by the state monopoly.</page><page sequence="5">Building Empire through Argumentation 371 The first exchange between the two groups provides a sketch of the entire de bate. Wenxue opened the debate by accusing the state of taking fortune away from the people by monopolizing salt, iron, and liquor, and by operating retail businesses. Such a practice, he observed, drew people away from their natural kindness and simplicity; instead, it cultivated greed and selfishness. When they saw that officials gained windfall fortunes through state-operated industries, the people became envi ous and slighted agricultural production, which should have been the major focus of the state. Without sufficient agricultural products, people would suffer from hunger and starvation; therefore, Wenxue proposed that the state relinquish its monopoly and prioritize agriculture over the handicraft industry and commercial activities. Such a forceful opening shows Wenxue's directness despite the imbalanced power relation involved. Defensive, Daifu, the minister of supervision, claimed that the Xiongnu people had been rebellious, and that they regularly harassed and robbed the Han people living on the borders. Concerned about his people, Emperor Wu had ordered the construction of fortresses and message stations along the borders. He had also or dered troops to station and to cultivate new farmland along the borders. Because these defensive moves were costly, the emperor had sanctioned state monopoly over various industries to collect money for the state treasury. Daifu argued that once the state monopoly ended, the state coffers would dry up, the troops would not be able to afford new military equipment, and the soldiers would suffer from both hunger and cold weather. Thus, the state monopoly should continue. In this rebuttal, Daifu invoked the deceased emperor to defend government policies. The minister's proclivity for the Legalist school became clearer in the ensuing exchanges. When defending the current economic and military policies, Daifu re peatedly cited the achievements of Shang Yang, the most renowned practitioner of Legalism. Shang Yang was an advisor to a king of the Qin at the end of the Warring States period (476 BCE-221 BCE). He proposed a series of measures to consolidate the king's power. Daifu recounted Shang's deeds with admiration: He established a civil code and punished violators severely. He reformed politics and education, so evil and dishonesty had nowhere to hide. He found countless ways to fill up the state coffer and taxed those who developed woods and lakes. The country became rich and the people healthy. Farmers had sufficient equipment and harvested more than what they needed. Therefore, Qin was able to conquer its rivals and expand its territory; it was able to support its troops without taxing its own people. (Qtd. in Huan 43)1 With Shang Yang's measures, the state of Qin finally united China by annexing the other six states. Comparing the current policies to those of Shang, Daifu argued that they similarly benefited the state and did no harm to the people. By making such</page><page sequence="6">372 College English a comparison, and by favorably citing Shang Yang's example thirteen times in the entire debate, Daifu identified himself as a contemporary Shang Yang?a reformer and a loyalist to Legalism. The officials further revealed their Legalist leanings when explicating the sua sive power of the present civil code. Daifu argued that when strict law and order are established, they deter the people from behaving recklessly or dishonestly: We judge robbery-inflicted injuries as the same crime as homicide because we want to castigate the offender's evil intentions. Likewise, The Spring and Autumn Annals condemned the State of Lu despite that it attacked the State of Qi indirectly by using the State of Chu's troops. So there are good reasons why a light offence should be severely punished or why a minor crime be judged the same way as a major crime is judged. (Qtd. in Huan 292) Daifu cited the Annals, a Confucian classic, to argue for the need to punish offenders based on their intentions. When making the same argument, Daifu cited another renowned Legalist, Han Fei, for understanding the nuanced rhetorical power of the civil code: "Master Han was angry that rulers did not understand the power of either the common law or their unique social position in governing their officials. [...] Confused by the words of Confucian literati, these rulers even became doubtful of the strategies proposed by their advisors" (qtd. in Huan 295). By citing Legalist sources, officials, as represented by Daifu, clearly harbored a deep trust in the Legalist approach to governing a state, that is, "to establish unity and stability through the singularities of a common law or order (fa), strategic method (shu), and position/ power of the ruler (shi)n (Lyon 56). To draw a clear line between the two groups, the officials attacked Confucianism, or more exactly the Confucian literati, whenever they could. Although established as a state ideology decades before, Confucianism was always counterbalanced by imperialist and Legalist undercurrents, as represented by government officials like Daifu. Disparaging the entire school would corrupt the literati's ethos and logos. The officials first recounted the political and cultural activities of Confucian adherents in the past, and then concluded that those individuals never brought peace to the state or glory to the ruler (Huan 70). As the logic went, the literati's proposal to end the monopoly would certainly not benefit the state either. Next, the officials questioned the usefulness of Confucian training for governing the state, and they ridiculed the personal traits of the literati, arguing that they were not virtuous, wise, honest, or brave (133-40). Further, the officials chided the literati for habitually using vague and bookish language in the debate: "You are talking gibberish. Your suggestions need to be practical. Don't use big, outdated words to confuse us" (qtd. in Huan 257). Questioning the literati's training and criticizing their language style indirectly cast doubt on the soundness of the literati's arguments. The literati certainly did not give in to any of those accusations; they fought back strenuously. Criticizing</page><page sequence="7">Building Empire through Argumentation 373 Confucianism and its adherents relentlessly underscored a clear divide between the two groups in terms of their political philosophy. However, the officials were not so purely Legalist. They drew rhetorical re sources from other schools, such as the Mohist and the Confucian. In the case of Confucianism, they first adopted the same value system, or at least the same moral terms, as the Confucian debaters. For example, when discussing strategies to deal with the Xiongnu people, Daifu portrayed these people as violating basic human values such as xian (H virtue), ren humanity), and jy/ (d justice or righteousness). Therefore, the government should take military actions against these inhuman, unjust beings and show no mercy: People commonly say: "Virtuous individuals will not stand being humiliated." [. . .] Under the rule of the enlightened Son of Heaven, Xiongnu rebelled and harassed our border areas. They were guilty of both inhumanity and injustice. Because of their harassment, people living on the borders could not even pick edible wild herbs. In the past, Di people attacked Emperor Tai; Kuang people besieged Confucius. They were robbers of humanity. Therefore, the state strengthened its military muscle to attack injustice and it built weapons to guard against inhumanity. (Qtd. in Huan 221) By portraying the Xiongnu people as representatives of injustice and inhuman ity, values generally disdained by the Confucians, Daifu tried to justify the state's foreign policies. However, Xianliang refuted Daifu's argument by exposing his ethnocentrism: as the Xiongnu had cultivated a lifestyle different from the Han's, they should not be judged by Confucian values such as justice and ritual. Second, the officials strengthened their arguments by citing from Confucian classics. As the examples have shown so far, they cited from the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Analects (the record of the Kuang people besieging Confucius). Because the officials appealed to the same values as the Confucian literati and cited sources from various schools, it is reductive and essentializing to label their discourse as Legalist, as previ ous scholars tended to do. Their discourse should be viewed as a hybrid because it imbibes values of several major schools. Nonetheless, this pro-Legalist hybrid was subsumed to the authority of the law, used to support imperial power rather than the aspirations of a multiethnic empire. By understanding that the officials' discourse was not purely Legalist, but more flexible and adaptive, we start to uncover the complexity of the argumentative culture in Western Han China. Although only Confucianism was endorsed by the state and only Confucian classics were seriously studied in the imperial academy, the other schools were not banned. As we continue to see in my analysis, officials were well versed in several major schools: Legalism, Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism, and the Yin-Yang. Because some officials, like Daifu, were not recruited through court debates but through connections with the royal clan (Huan 107), it becomes clear that training in non-Confucian schools was available to the literati in Western Han</page><page sequence="8">374 College English society. Although Confucianism became the primary gateway for literati to join the officialdom, mainstream rhetorical training remained open and versatile. The Discourse of the Confucians Confucian literati developed a new cluster of concepts to advise the ruler of the empire. First, they recycled Confucius's concepts but used them kairotically, or strategically in a particular rhetorical situation. Second, like the pro-Legalist officials, they unapologetically borrowed resources from other schools to build their rhetorical toolbox. Flexibility and hybridity characterized Confucianism in the Western Han. Let us now take a look at how Western Han Confucians constructed arguments by using Confucius's favorite concepts kairotically and by absorbing resources from other schools. Rectification of Names Rectification of names (jE^5 zhengming) is probably the best-known concept in Confucius's discourse of language and society. In the Analects, Confucius empha sizes correcting the language to ensure a truthful representation of reality. Xing Lu argues that such a perspective implies that a clear demarcation of individuals' social status and kinship identities will lead to social stability and harmony (160-62). In the context where Confucius employs the concept, he specifically addresses the rela tion between correct language and effective government. When conversing with his student Zilu, who aspires to enter civil service, the Master instructs: "If language is incorrect, then what is said does not concord with what was meant; if what is said does not concord with what was meant, what is to be done cannot be effected [.. .] then mutilating punishments and lesser punishment will go astray [. . .] then the people have nowhere to put hand or foot" (Confucius 171-72).2 For Confucius, the use of correct language regulates not only the relationship between individuals, but also the relationship between the ruler and his subjects; both types of relationship are vital to social harmony and stability. The Confucian debaters widely used this concept to advance their arguments, attaching new significance to it. On one occasion, they quoted Confucius's rec tification of names verbatim to clarify the appropriate way to enter officialdom. Daifu suggested that, as officialdom aspirants, the literati should not always cling to fundamental Confucian values. Instead, they should be flexible and adaptable like the renowned advisors Yi Yi and Baili Xi. In order to approach their rulers, Yi Yi cooked meat for King Tang and Baili Xi fed oxen for King Mo of Qin. Daifu com mented on these two advisors: "They compromised their values (^'p gouhe) in the beginning. Once they had gained the ruler's trust, they actualized their aspirations by assisting the ruler to become a great king." In response, Wenxue accused Daifu</page><page sequence="9">Building Empire through Argumentation 375 of misrepresenting Yi Yi and Baili Xi as compromising their values. He argued that the two advisors approached the rulers successfully because they had long developed their administrative wisdom, which highly appealed to the rulers. Then he said, "The Master says, 'If language is incorrect, then what is said does not concord with what was meant; if what is said does not concord with what was meant, what is to be done cannot be effected.' How could they have helped the rulers to become great kings by compromising their own values?" (qtd. in Huan 75). By quoting Confucius's rectification of names, Wenxue not only debunked Daifu's interpretation of the two historical figures, but more important, he refused to compromise his values in order to become a government official. In this particular example, rectification of names was used not only to regulate human relationships, but also to argue for a particular interpretation of the past, which certainly influenced the present. Often the Confucian debaters slyly used the rectification of names to criticize the pro-Legalist perspective on government and to gain moral high ground. Although both groups shared the same moral values, they interpreted them differently. Employ ing the rectification of names, the Confucian debaters not only defended the Confu cian interpretation of these values, but also demonstrated their moral superiority, thus strengthening their ethos. For example, when Daifu argued that mutilation and law could stop violence and assist the ruler in governing his subjects, Wenxue sneered at such a Legalist position: "The Emperor of Qin Junior was misled by Zhao Gao's approach, believing in severe mutilating punishments and law. Mutilated people were seen everywhere and the number of executed people increased daily. Those who killed the most were considered loyal (JS zhong) and those who severely harmed people were considered capable (t&amp; neng)" (qtd. in Huan 308). In response, Daifu argued that times had changed. Officials could not use an approach developed in an era of natural simplicity and kindness to govern the cunning people of the present age. Wenxue refuted the argument, stressing the cultivation of a humane and kind character among the people rather than depending on mutilating punishments and laws to manage them: "When one does not tackle the major cause but the minor cause of an issue, he would be called stupid (M yu) in the past but is called wise (H? zhi) now. When one flogs violators gravely with a stick to stop chaos or scratches off words on the bamboo slips with a knife, he would be considered unjust (M zei) but is called virtuous (if xian) now" (qtd. in Huan 311). Wenxue believed that in those instances, terms such as loyal, capable, wise, and virtuous were used erratically to embellish pro-Legalist acts. To rectify these terms meant to prioritize humanity and justice over severe laws and mutilating punishments in governing the Han people. The Suasive Potential of Rituals Regarding persuasion, Confucius valued the suasive potential of rites and encour aged his students to study rites of previous dynasties. Rites (fiH It) are a complex of</page><page sequence="10">376 College English social codes that signify what society values most. They embody the total spectrum of social norms, customs, and mores, covering increasingly complicated relationships and institutions. The appropriate acts prescribed by the rites not only regulate cer emonial occasions, but also govern daily human interactions. As I argued previously, by performing or participating in the rituals, one would become identified with the community values and would be persuaded automatically ("The Way"). Confucius sees the performance of rites as a social indicator of the Way, or the natural and harmonious way that the universe operates in the Chinese ideal. When Confucius talks about ritual, he hopes to use it as a means to restore peace and integrity to the disintegrated Zhou society. When Confucian debaters evoked the suasive potential of ritual, they gave it more power than Confucius did. They believed that ritual symbols would work not only with the Han people, but also with people beyond the empire. It was a means to befriend, if not to conquer, the enemies. When dealing with neighboring coun tries, particularly with Xiongnu, Daifu-led officials believed that only strong military actions would contain them. Only after a strong military presence was established along the borders would the Xiongnu troops be deterred and the Han people be protected. In contrast, the Confucian debaters insisted on treating the Xiongnu with humanity and ritual. Wenxue argued, "The Book of Songs says that 'When one presents me with peaches as a gift, I will return him with pears.' I never heard that one who treats others with kindness will be rewarded with evil. Thus a gentleman, instead of offending them, should respect the others following the ritual. People all over the world are brothers. If we can examine ourselves reflectively and candidly, what do we need to worry about?" (qtd. in Huan 262). As Confucius once admonished his disciples, according to the Analects, to be a gentleman and an ideal ruler, one has to cultivate himself and his own people first through culture and morality (Huan 203). Wenxue believed that the suasive power of ritual performance, being part of culture and morality, would positively affect any human being. The officials and the Confucian debaters were fundamentally divided by their differing convictions about non-Han people. As the above quotation reveals, the Confucian debaters held a familial, egalitarian, empathetic view toward the Other by calling them brothers. Therefore, they were confident that the power of ritual could transcend ethnic differences and transform even their enemies. In contrast, Daifu harbored an ethnocentric view toward non-Han people. He clearly showed his chauvinism in the way that he described the Xiongnu people: he portrayed them as irrational animals. For example, in response to Wenxue's proposal of treating Xiongnu with respect following the ritual, Daifu contended that this approach would not work: "During the Spring and Autumn period, the six warring states formed an alliance by the rulers exchanging their hats and belts. However, they reneged on the agreement. How can you expect a country of animals to follow through a truce? [...]</page><page sequence="11">Building Empire through Argumentation 377 Xiongnu made peace agreements with us many times through interethnic marriages. However, they often broke the agreement first" (qtd. in Huan 263). In other places, Daifu described the Xiongnu people specifically as "termites," "greedy wolves," and "fierce tigers" (qtd. in Huan 257-59) that needed to be contained with force. Clearly, Daifu used animalization as a strategy to cast doubts on the Xiongnu people's ethos and to refuse any engaged dialogue with them. In contrast to Wenxue's conviction about human fraternity, the use of animalization unequivocally reveals Daifu's eth nocentrism in dealing with foreign nations. Thanks to their trust in the suasive potential of rituals, the Confucian debaters envisioned a world united under an enlightened ruler. The ruler led the world not through military violence but through his virtuous government, which manifested partly through the ritual symbols. Wenxue elaborated on the working of virtue and ritual: The ruler stands in his court but he listens to the rest of the world. As his benevolence affects people afar, even distant nations that enjoy distinct customs send delegates to his court. Regardless of phoenixes in the woods or unicorns by the lake, everything in the world will be blessed by his virtue. The ruler does not work on everything himself but his humanity travels in all directions. Fan Li came from ethnic Yue and You Yu grew up as an ethnic Hu, but they all advised the great king willingly. Government stipulations may not work, but nobody in the world is insusceptible to the working of virtue and ritual. (Qtd. in Huan 263-64) On one hand, Wenxue shared Confucius's conviction that a ruler's benevolence and justice would affect his subjects like a gentle wind blowing over the grass. As the West ern Han gradually annexed tribe states in the eastern, southern, and southwestern regions, this political conviction became even more pivotal in pacifying and uniting these new peoples. On the other hand, Wenxue actively used Confucius's notion of rites as a counter-strategy to the officials' military and anti-rhetorical strategy. If ethnic minorities Fan Li and You Yu were persuaded by, or identified with, the ruler's benevolence, the Xiongnu people might respond positively to the emperor's benevolence, which would thus be conducive to the Western Han's territorial ambi tion. The Confucian debaters' trust in humanity and human fraternity undergirded their ritualistic-rhetorical approach to empire building. Yin-Yang and Non-Action Yin-yang was a concept shared by both the officials and the Confucian debaters. Yin and yang are often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and in the valley. Yin ($|) is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (P?) is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what has been obscured and obscuring what has been revealed. The dialectical relationship between yin and yang is crystal clear</page><page sequence="12">378 College English in the Book of Change, which Confucius purportedly edited. Curiously, however, Confucius does not use yin-yang explicitly in his teaching in the Analects. Instead, the concept was embraced by a group called the Yin-Yang school to explicate agri cultural, medical, meteorological, and astronomical phenomena. Yin-yang entered political discourse in the Warring States period and promi nently in the Western Han through Dong Zhongshu. Dong evoked yin-yang to explain the Way of Heaven (^iS tiandao), or the working of the universe, in his famous discourse with Emperor Wu in 134 BCE. He argued that the emperor was the Son of Heaven, so he needed to comprehend the Heavenly mandate accurately. If he failed to act according to the mandate, he would be warned by natural signs or would even be punished by natural calamities. Yin-yang was the key to comprehending the workings of the universe (see Liu and You). By the time the debate on salt and iron took place, Dong's theory about communication between the anthropomorphic Heaven and humans, yin-yang being a central tenet of the theory, had become part of one's rhetorical training. On one occasion, when Daifu asked the Confucian de baters to explain the correspondence between natural signs and happenings within the empire, Wenxue answered the call by evoking yin-yang and by attributing the concept to Dong (Huan 285). In debate, both sides used yin-yang to advance their arguments, demonstrating how widespread this concept was in the Western Han period. On one occasion, the Confucian debaters used the concept to criticize the ills of Han society. Wenxue made an analogy: a good doctor would be able to cure a patient by adjusting yin and yang forces in the sickened body. When the air and blood veins were balanced and unblocked, the evil air would leave the body. However, in the present Han "body," the rich became richer while the poor became poorer. The officials established severe laws and enforced heavy mutilating punishments to stop violence and evil; however, violence and evil grew more rampant. Therefore, the officials proved to be unqualified social "doctors" who had failed their jobs miserably (Huan 89). This analogy revealed rhetorical training in the Western Han. First, yin-yang had become a heuristic for the Confucian debaters to interpret and to argue about in relation to the evolution of human society. Wenxue connected the workings of Han society to the workings of the universe in general, as Dong Zhongshu would have done. Second, epistemically, yin-yang had become the common vocabulary of Chinese medicine: doctors used yin and yang to explain how the body works and to argue for treatment of a certain disease. Whereas Wenxue resorted to yin-yang to criticize the malfunctioning of the officials, Daifu used the same concept to respond to Wenxue's criticism. He explained that everything happens according to the Way of Heaven, and one should not only blame the officials: "Floods and droughts are caused by Heaven; hunger and good harvests reflect the change of yin and yang. People will suffer from drought when</page><page sequence="13">Building Empire through Argumentation 379 Taishui Star orbits in the yang position, or they suffer from floods when the star moves to its yin position. Hunger occurs every six years while bad harvest comes once every twelve years" (qtd. in Huan 211). Daifu turned yin-yang into his own service. However, while Confucians believed that a balance of yin-yang could be acquired through human knowledge and effort, Daifu harbored a more deterministic concep tion of yin-yang. His defense further confirms that yin-yang had become not only a common epistemic term in agriculture and cosmology, but also the vocabulary of any learned man in Western Han society. Besides borrowing from the Yin-Yang school, Confucian debaters also embraced Daoist notions, particularly the idea of non-action (Mfb wuwei). The Daoists, headed by Laozi, emphasized speaking, acting, and governing according to dao, or the natu ral Way, which was the most efficient and effective way to persuade and to govern (Combs). In governing the populace, Daoists advocated a least intrusive approach called non-action. The Confucian debaters repeatedly appealed to this approach. For example, Wenxue praised earlier Han emperors for taking a Daoist laissez-faire approach to state making, in order to contrast with and attack the monopoly policy: "In the past, we fostered a peaceful relation with Xiongnu through interethnic mar riages. All neighboring tribe states presented tributes to us. There was a deep trust between the emperor and his subjects, so ethnic Hu and ethnic Yue did not pose any threats to the empire. In those days, the government demanded little and thus was satisfied easily. People lived in peace and happiness" (qtd. in Huan 243). Portraying the past as an ideal state of government was a conventional strategy in the Confucian school, but praising the early Han emperors affirmed the Daoist non-action approach to government. On another occasion, the Confucian debaters criticized a severe legal practice by mixing Laozi's non-action with Confucius's rectification of names. According to the civil code of the empire, when one family committed a crime, the neighboring four or nine families would also be punished. Wenxue argued against such a practice: "Laozi says, 'The ruler has no desires and the people return to the good and simple life. The ruler does nothing and people become rich.' When the ruler and his officials, or the father and his son, submitted to their socially designated roles, why do we need to group five families together [to prevent crimes] or what does the government need to worry about?" (qtd. in Huan 303). Like the discourse of the pro-Legalist officials, the Confucian debaters' discourse was a cultural and rhetorical hybrid. Concerned about uniting the warring states, Confucius promoted the old culture of Zhou as the ideal for a united China, and he developed a full-fledged system of thoughts on governing the state. In contrast, while the Confucian debaters concurred with Confucius on human nature and cultural ide als, they consciously incorporated thoughts from other schools, such as the Yin-Yang and the Daoist. Rhetorically, they continued to use Confucius's favorite concepts, such as rectification of names and ritual, when making arguments. Responding to</page><page sequence="14">380 College English the exigencies of their times, such as the rise of Confucianism as the state orthodox and the Western Han's metamorphosing into an increasingly multiethnic society, Confucian debaters added kairotical meanings to the old concepts and ushered new concepts into the Confucian rhetorical canon. Challenges and Possibilities of Rhetoric Political debates certainly did not come without stakes. An imperial state tends to seek a unified set of values to guard both its politico-cultural integrity and the ruling class's interests. For example, in the short-lived Qin dynasty (221 BCE-206 BCE), the emperor favored the Legalist school. He killed scholars of other schools and burned their books. In the ensuing Western Han dynasty, to recuperate the nation from years of wars, the state championed the Daoist notion of least government meddling?until Emperor Wu resorted to Confucianism to consolidate state power. Bringing a critical voice to the hearing of the rulers and the ranking officials is po tentially dangerous in any political debate. To win a debate, one must demonstrate both political sensitivity and rhetorical dexterity. Although the debate on salt and iron focused on economic, military, legal, and agricultural issues, it also revealed the challenges and possibilities of political debates in the Western Han. Confucian official-orators faced various challenges. For one thing, striving to become a competent official-orator meant risking one's own life. In the debate, the officials and the Confucians cited numerous examples of competent official-orators whose candid criticisms led to praiseworthy political outcomes. However, in Chinese imperial history, official-orators often lost their lives in their pursuit of honorary titles such as "loyal official" and "honest advisor." Second, rhetorical training did not simply mean training eloquent speakers; it meant training eloquent officials. One's successful training would lead to a government position, which required both communicative and administrative skills. On many occasions, Daifu criticized the Confucian debaters for being out of touch with real-life issues. He once questioned their competence to govern: "You cherish the past but criticize the present. You talked a lot about the past, which in fact didn't matter much to the present issues. Probably you don't understand what it truly means to be an official-advisor. Or did you exaggerate your ability with flowery words? Why is it so hard to meet virtuous gentlemen?" (qtd. in Huan 62). Indeed, successful court examinees often proved to be incompetent administrators in Chinese imperial history (Elman). Despite realistic obstacles to becoming ideal official-orators, the Confucian debaters finally proved themselves, according to Yan tie lun. The literati demon strated their oratorical success in two major accounts. First, they achieved part of their political goal: the state abolished its monopoly over iron and liquor in certain areas of the country. Second, they were accredited and placed into various Daifu</page><page sequence="15">Building Empire through Argumentation 381 ranks by the emperor (Huan 238). The debate functioned as an excruciating exam. The literati passed it by performing the role of ideal official-orators, who would "risk their lives to point out their master's misbehaviors" and would "risk displeas ing ranking officials by criticizing their wrongdoings" (qtd. in Huan 131). However, joining the officialdom did not mean the end of their rhetorical training. Down the road, as they had already done in the debate, in their administrative posts these new officials would have to learn how to negotiate between their Confucian values and values of other schools. After a visit to a political debate in the Western Han, probably the most strik ing revelation is that public debate is not the sole property of the Greco-Roman rhetorical tradition. Some assert that ancient Greeks favored argumentation because they valued individualism and competiveness, whereas non-Western cultures used rhetoric for the purposes of agreement, reconciliation, and emotionalism (Becker; Kennedy 197-99). Others have described modern Chinese as habitually trying to avoid confrontation and being indirect when expressing themselves; and they have attributed these characteristics to the lack of an argumentative tradition in China (Cai; Connor). The stereotypical view of the non-argumentative Chinese, in part derived from the West's ignorance of the East, has perpetuated Orientalism in communica tion and composition studies. My analysis of the debate on salt and iron has revealed the complexities of the Chinese argumentative tradition. In fact, argumentation is a viable mode of communication between modern citizens East and West. To better use this mode, we need to understand more about the argumentative tradition in non-Western cultures. This ancient debate also bears direct implications for communication and global ization. Contemporary globalization can be understood in ways that are comparable to the situation of China during the period of the salt and iron debate?a large terri tory, somewhat heterogeneous, defined by a number of different rhetorical schools representing competing interests of different groups. While both the pro-Legalists and the Confucians used hybrid rhetorical styles, the pro-Legalists used rhetoric only in support of conservative legal practices. They were more authoritarian in their rhetorical practices. The Confucians, on the other hand, used hybrid styles to rhetorically disarm and reconstruct power in some way, and thus remained more in touch with history, context, customs, and the masses. Their critical voices brought the attention of those in power to the interests of the Other?not only the interests of the disenfranchised merchants, landlords, peasants, and recently annexed ethnic groups inside the empire, but also the interests of people beyond the empire, like the Xiongnu. In the age of globalization, rhetoric offers the marginalized Other, through critical reflections like those of the Confucian debaters, opportunities to speak to and against the privileged. Rhetorical practice in the Western Han, as well as that of other cultures, confirms</page><page sequence="16">382 College English the value of traditional humanistic goals and methods in educating citizens of the globalized world. Confucian humanist beliefs led the Confucian debaters to argue for treating the Xiongnu people with respect, ritual, and dignity. A global citizen, as Wendy Hesford argues, should strive for human rights and should give substance to liberal humanism (797). When dealing with other people and other cultures, we must train citizens who?like the Confucian debaters, the "gadfly" Socrates (Plato), or St. Augustine (Troup)?can act to counter dehumanizing arguments and actions similar to those of the pro-Legalist officials. Of course, comparable gadflies constantly rose in American imperial history. For example, concerning "the Indian problem" in the late nineteenth century, writers such as Helen Hunt Jackson and members of the Women's National Indian Association severely criticized the U.S. government for treating native Indians, the Other of the American empire, with injustice, cruelty, and perfidy (Powell). The belief in liberal humanism, and the courage for intercultural and transnational dialogue, should be instilled in our students and should become the foundation of their rhetorical education. We also need to fully recognize both the power and limitations of rhetoric. In the debate on salt and iron, the Confucian debaters demonstrated the material effects of their discursive acts. They successfully weakened the state monopoly on salt, iron, and liquor; they were admitted into the government ranks. However, the debate also reveals the kinds of danger involved in the use of rhetoric. In the U.S. democratic system, students receive rhetorical education for civic participation, and they often assume equality between the orator and the audience. This assumption is both naive and dangerous for a global citizen living in a world of structural inequali ties. In reality, power relations shift across rhetorical contexts. Failing to recognize the structural, material inequalities involved in discursive relations will render one's communication ineffective at best and damaging at worst. Notes 1.
