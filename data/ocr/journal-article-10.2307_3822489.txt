<plain_text><page sequence="1">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 DURING the 2002-03 field season the Society carried out an extensive programme of work in the four main geographical areas where its recent research has been focused. Penelope Wilson undertook work at Sais (a report to be published next year) and on behalf of the ongoing Delta Survey, and fieldwork, including numerous smaller projects, continued at Memphis and Amarna. The Qasr Ibrim work comprised a study season based in Shellal and a short period on site, when the wall-painting from the temple of Taharqa was conserved and removed. Reports on these works follow. Such projects would be impossible without the ongoing help and co-operation of the officials of the Supreme Council for Antiquities in Egypt, particularly its Secretary General Zahi Hawass, and the Society and all its field workers would like to extend warmest thanks to them. Thanks must also be expressed to the Director General of Foreign and Egyptian Missions Magdi el-Ghandour, to the staff of the security office in Abbassiya and to the regional inspectorates, all of whom have provided generous assistance. The Society is also grateful for the constant facilitating efforts of Rawya Ismail in the Cairo office of the EES. The Delta Survey, 2002 WORK continued on collecting information about and surveying sites in the western and central areas of the Delta (fig. 1). The team of Penelope Wilson (field director), Richard Morley (surveyor), Elizabeth Cook and Derek Pretious (surveying assistants) and Mohammed Abdul Rahman Hamed (SCA representative) worked from 6 to 25 Septem- ber 2002.1 Topographical Surveys Tell Qabrit (Lat. 31°13'30"N, Long. 30°35'50"E) Preliminary notes by A. J. Spencer, 'Roman Sites in the Northwest Delta', in U. Luft (ed.), The Intellectual Heritage of Egypt (Studia Aegyptiaca 14; Budapest, 1992), 536. This small, red-coloured tell (fig. 2) is situated in Kafr el-Sheikh province, north-west of Tell Farain and to the east of the small village of Qabrit. There is no concentrated modern settlement around the site, but it is bordered on the south by the road and on the other sides by fields. Some of the border areas are used as crop drying or temporary storage areas by farmers. The tell has no cover except for small patches of brush, and the soil is either red in hue or, in places, grey. There is a reasonable amount of degraded 1 The work was greatly facilitated by the police and guards at Sa el-Hagar and all the sites, by Senne el-Bish and by Rawya Ismail in Cairo.

The dry surface dust is about 20 cm deep and can be scraped away to the damper, more compact soil. In the early morning (and possibly after rain) building patterns can be seen on the surface, mostly occurring in the form of small square structures. The tell is quite low, about 5.5 m in total from its lowest to highest point, but it stands no more than 4.1 m up from the ground level at the site. The dimensions are 875 m (east-west) by 757 m (north-south). The eastern to southern sides of the tell are relatively level on the top, descending to the edges in a gentle slope. There are some larger rain gullies running from the top to the edges, and a track goes through the site from east to west. The northern and western sides of Tell Qabrit are more uneven and undulate in a series of small hillocks and mounds. A few of the mounds towards the centre of the site form the highest points of the tell and one was used to fix the siting point for the survey (X =0, Y=0). This 0,0 point is now marked with a permanent iron survey marker. The shape of the tell may be due, in part, to wind erosion, with the wind blowing from north to south creating the smoother southern tail-back of the tell. It was difficult to discern any pattern to the hills, though some of the modern tracks may indicate more substantial walls beneath the surface. Some excavations have been carried out at the site by the SCA, including exposure of a series of Late Antique buildings to the south (in 2000) and a red-brick church building in the central area (in 2001). The more pitted areas suggest that there has been some sebakh digging on the site and the flatter section to the north-east may be the 2 JEA 89</page><page sequence="3">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 ,%.

Tell Qabrit. remnants of a light railway embankment, perhaps suggesting that sebakh was once mined here on a larger scale. The church building (pl. I, 1) was associated with pottery of the fourth to seventh centuries. The surviving walls measure 26.5 m from east to west and 12.1 m from north to south and were about 1.05 m thick. They are preserved to a height of 65 cm. The church is made from at least two consignments of different sized red-bricks and had a rectangular outline oriented east-west. It had a font in the centre (originally marble faced and lined), but the apse end had been completely robbed out. The building had limestone paving at the west end and possibly marble paving at the east end, though this had largely been removed. The walls of the church were originally plastered and founded upon layers of crushed limestone chips and earlier pottery. Among the debris a block with a few hieroglyphs in raised relief was found, suggesting that a pharaonic site nearby may have provided much of the stone building material, or indeed, that there was a pharaonic part to this site.2 Seven red granite grinding stones were found on the surface, probably having been uncovered during the sebakh digging and left there as they were too heavy to take away. One limestone block was also noted. Recent work for a new pipeline at the eastern side of the site gave an opportunity to look at the material from the trench. Again, the pottery is consistent with the fourth to 2 Other hieroglyphic blocks have been reported from here, according to A. J. Spencer (personal communication).  3 2003</page><page sequence="4">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 Tell Amya Egypt Exploration Society Survey 2002 P. Wilson, D.Pretious, R. Morley, E. Cook 0 lOO1m N Road FIG. 3.

Tell Amya (Lat. 3 1 13'40"N, Long. 30°38'00"E) Notes by Spencer, in Luft (ed.), The Intellectual Heritage of Egypt, 535-6. This tell (fig. 3) is smaller than Tell Qabrit, being 460 m by 320 m in size and reaching a height of around 8 m to the highest point from the surrounding ground surface (pl. I, 2). There is a high central ridge running north to south across the site, apparently the remains of a former tell left thus by sebakhin diggers. The whole site has suffered the depredations of digging. It seems to have been cleared away by a workforce some time in the past, starting from the east and west and working towards the central area, where it stopped, leaving the present ridge. The sides of this ridge show that some small-scale digging is still happening here, and a number of pits of about 1.5 to 2 m in depth with sacks left at the site suggest that limited removal of sebakh or pottery is continuing. The holes left by the digging gave an opportunity to look at the stratigraphy of the site. There was pottery in the sections but not in dense concentrations. There did not seem to be obvious brick features and no signs of burning were noted.  4 JEA 89</page><page sequence="5">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 The lack of structures uncovered in these diggings suggests that the archaeological strata of the site have been too extensively disturbed, at least at the present surface level, to be able to determine whether there are any building features. Experience suggests that even in the most difficult cases, the removal of rubbish at the top level, sometimes to some depth, will lead to the uncovering of some kinds of buildings or other structures. The amounts of red-brick at Tell Amya, the patches of grey mud-brick and the pottery strata suggest that structures did once stand here, but their nature cannot be determined by surface survey alone. The pottery from the site is similar to that at Tell Qabrit, with similar ARS/Egyptian imitation wares, pottery with cream and brown paint stylised plant decoration, imported amphorae, 'carrot' amphorae, and a number of Nile silt-ware bowls or basins with either ribbing or pie crust rims. There is also a good quantity of glass at the site, but, in contrast to Qabrit, there is not the same amount of kiln or slag-like brick work (i.e. bricks which have virtually vitrified and smaller pieces of slag). A number of corroded bronze coins were found on the surface, varying in their state of preservation and ranging from about 0.5 cm in diameter to 2 cm. One large fragment of red granite had been uncovered by the sebakh diggers. It seems to be an unfinished grindstone, still with roughly cut surfaces. Tell Amya has less obvious archaeological potential than Qabrit but it clearly forms one of a series of Byzantine sites in this area at which occupation may have ended around the same time. The fact that they form an east-west line, maybe aligning with sites in a north-south formation towards Lake Burullus, may indicate a road or river channel system, now lost. A further regional study may suggest reasons for the existence of the sites in the first place and then for their subsequent abandonment, destruction and demise, with people moving off into other newer towns along the Rosetta Branch of the Nile in the medieval period. Tell Matiur (Lat. 31°13'50"N, Long. 30°39'05"E) This site was visited as it formed the most westward of this small chain of sites. From the surface pottery, it dates from the Byzantine Period, during the tenth century.3 The site is 432 m from south-west to north-east and around 280 m from north to south, rising to about 6-8 m above the local ground level. A number of circular brick granaries or storage chambers have been excavated here by the SCA. The site is now almost exhausted, having had very many small test sondages dug here by the SCA. It will become the municipal rubbish dump for Disuq. Tell Mutubis (Lat. 31°17'13"N, Long. 30033'33"E) Following the mapping work undertaken in 2001 by the Delta Survey, the opportunity was taken to recheck some measurements and to carry out four drill augurs at the site.4 The results of the drill cores suggest that the present tell demonstrates the continuous occupation of this site from perhaps the late Ptolemaic Period to Byzantine times, maybe 3 P.

Much of this city was founded on clean alluvium (flood deposited sediment) and also, perhaps, on drained marsh areas. On the eastern side of the tell, the existence of cultural material such as pottery to a depth of nearly 4 m suggested that there had been an older settlement at this side of the current tell and that the Roman town had grown from it. Clearly further work would be needed to determine the extent of this area and its date in relation to the rest of the tell. Tell Mutubis, then, may have an older history than is at first apparent. Tells Visited Visits were paid to a small number of other sites and information collected about others. As can be seen below, the modern Survey of Egypt maps prove to have incorrect names for the sites or none at all, and many sites have been lost since the earlier Survey of Egypt maps. Kom el-Akhdar (Lat. 31°26'55"N, Long. 30°49'47"E) This is a large tell inside Lake Burullus, marked on the Survey of Egypt maps as Gezira Kom el-Akhdar. The tell has a narrow rectangular shape and a number of small inlets and harbours which allow boats to pass through the reeds and moor. Our mooring point was formed by a number of large limestone blocks, possibly constituting a low wall. The surface of the tell is sandy and in places is covered with low-growing shrubs, but it rises to a series of connected low mounds in the centre. There seem to be sandy mud- brick walls from buildings at the tops of these mounds. There is degraded pottery lying on the surface, buried in the sand and in the mud-brick areas. Among the pot sherds were amphora body sherds, including imported orange wares with cream/olive slip and a few red slipped and polished finer wares. There were also glass fragments and some fragments of burnt brick. Although the tell is an island, it is used to pasture cattle, and a small onion-like plant is also grown here and collected for medicinal purposes. Some small-scale digging has taken place and a large circular storage bin of pottery had been uncovered. The surface material is not dense and the meagre remains extend mainly over the high parts of the island, as far as could be judged. Tell Foqaa (Lat. 31°22'7"N, Long. 30°46'59"E) The site is marked on the modern Survey of Egypt map, but not named. The tell is inaccessible by road as it is surrounded by fish farms with banks built up into dykes along which the footpaths run. The tell is large in size, rising smoothly to a central high point containing an iron survey marker (a second marker is on the eastern side). To the north-east, there is a more hillocky area on the sides of which some house plans are visible. The surface has no plant cover, but instead, the soil is coloured red by the degraded pottery and red-brick at the site. As the area is not often visited, the differences in soil texture can be seen by simply walking across the tell. In some places it is very soft and in other much firmer, perhaps where there are underlying structures. The surface material includes pottery such as some ribbed amphorae, ARS/ERS, glass, burnt red-brick and slag, all quite eroded and degraded. 6 JEA 89</page><page sequence="7">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 The site seemed to be Roman in date and relatively unaffected by sebakhin digging. It could be threatened by further exploitation of the fish farms. Tell Guraf (Beheira Province) (Lat. 31°12'52"N, Long. 30°25'5"E) The modern Survey of Egypt map labels this impressive tell as Tell Kafri. It rises to a series of high points of which the greatest is about 15 m above ground level. The main central mound and the smaller western mound both show building plans and, in some places, the surface has either been cleared or eroded to reveal small rectangular red- brick foundation structures. At least three of these were seen on this visit and they are assumed to be foundations because of their regular size over the different parts of the site. The tell is red in colour and covered in pottery, glass and brick dating to the Roman and Late Antique Periods. On the southern and northern sides are a number of gullies made by rainwater from which larger fragments of pottery could be extracted. Qasr Mahmudiyah (Beheira Province) This site was marked on the Survey of Egypt map as lying south of town of Mahmudiyah. The site of this qasr (fort) took some time to find because the land is now occupied by new buildings, including a school and some fields. The area had been flattened and there was no sign of a tell. Local residents confirmed that it had been an antiquities area but was no longer so. Tell el-Daba (Lat. 31°15'5"N, Lat. 30°51'38"E) The site is not marked on the current Survey of Egypt map. The tell had been occupied by a petroleum company rig, but this has now been removed and only the concrete bases for some of its buildings remain. The northern edge of the site was being used as a soil dump, though it was not clear if the soil there is from this tell or elsewhere. There was a large depression on the north-eastern side of the site which looked like an old sebakh excavation. Across the centre of the site was a whole series of small mounds, no more than 4 m maximum above the basic ground level. The tell measures approx- imately 400 m (east-west) by 300 m (north-south). On the south-west side there was a series of brick chambers, with arched doorways and vaulted ceilings. Otherwise there was comparatively little to see on the surface except for degraded burnt brick and pottery of Roman date. Kom el-Arab (Lat. 31018'59"N, Long. 30043'20"E) The Survey of Egypt map names this site incorrectly as Tell Kafri. This was a compact tell, rising to at least 10 m above the ground level. Its south side was smooth sloping to the summit of the mound and the north side was steeper in slope. A petroleum company had also been based at this site and left a road running north-south on the east side of the site. A football pitch now occupies the southern side of the tell. Three granite grinding stones were noted, along with Roman-Late Antique pottery and glass, a few corroded bronze coins and some fossil wood. It was noticed that this material was more obvious on the northern side, and some small holes had recently been dug here. 2003 7</page><page sequence="8">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 Tell ed-Dahab (Lat 31 20'14"N, Long. 30°44'17"E) (pl. I, 3) This site was visited because it seems to be one in a north-south chain of sites, perhaps along the line of a silted-up river channel. In fact, there is an ezbet here called Ezbet Kom ed-Dahab and the houses here probably also occupy a former kom. The antiquities area of the kom is under the cemetery of the hamlet and extends for about 150 m north-south and 60 m east-west. There is little archaeological material to be seen on the surface, as the debris from the older tombs is scattered on the ground. A survey marker (iron rail) is situated to the west; this is an area which could be tested with drill cores. Future work for the Delta Survey will concentrate on the other Roman-Late Antique tells in the western and central Delta. PENELOPE WILSON Memphis, 2002 Escarpment survey THE work of the escarpment survey began on 12 September 2002, the objectives being to continue and extend last year's work on the survey of the north Saqqara plateau and escarpment, and to open a limited area excavation at the foot of the escarpment to test the results of sediment cores taken and recorded in this area over the past ten years. The team was David Jeffreys (field director), Wendy Monkhouse (archaeologist), Mary Anne Murray (archaeobotanist) and Freya Sadarangani (archaeologist). The SCA was represented by Muhammad Ahmad Hassan Yusuf and we are very grateful for his able assistance and active interest. The surveying programme for the season was completed, with one-kilometre ground markers inserted across the Sacred Animal Necropolis (SAN), the Early Dynastic cemetery, the north side of the Teti Pyramid and down the escarpment to this year's excavation site (described below). These ground markers correspond to the 1978 Ministry of Housing maps in use by most colleagues working at Saqqara. Each marker is accompanied by a distinctive ranging pole bearing the coordinates. The purpose of this year's exposure was to test our past sediment-core data by examining the natural and man-made deposits under and around the north enclosure wall of the Hellenistic Anoubieion, which lies partly beneath the SCA Saqqara Inspectorate and descends the escarpment immediately to the east. A north-south trench was opened across the anticipated line of the wall, and the uppermost deposits (all modern) were removed. From the cadastral (land ownership) designations for the neighbouring area, Hod Hafiz (no. 27), we have given the excavation the site code HFZ02. The site in general lies just to the west of the boundary line between Hod Hafiz and Hod Faris (no. 22) to the north. Although the Anoubieion wall was well preserved in this area when last seen by us during the EES Temple Town Survey in 1976, the ground form has since been altered by some twenty exploratory pits dug by the SCA in the 1990s to assess the area's archaeological potential in advance of substantial building (a police station for the JEA 89 8</page><page sequence="9">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 Saqqara Monuments Area Tourist Police and 'Camel Corps'). The more southerly of these pits, towards the present emplacement of the Sign Yusuf ('Joseph's Prison', a local shrine and an important place of pilgrimage in medieval times), are reported to have yielded limestone blocks, traces of mudbrick structures and other finds, but the more northerly were apparently empty of archaeological remains, probably because the two areas were respectively inside and outside the temple precinct. The result of this exploratory testing by the SCA has been a series of medium to large (10 x 10 m or larger) depressions, now filled with driftsand, with discard heaps on all sides. One of these pits is located directly over the line of the enclosure wall where last seen in 1976, and concentrated mudbrick debris can be seen on the spoil dumps on either side. Spoil from this pit, and others nearby, has also raised the ground level by about a metre at the point where we first proposed to excavate. Trench edges had to be reinforced with sandbags on three sides to allow excavation to continue. In the confined area of this year's exposure, traces of detached Hellenistic brickwork were found at a depth of 3-4 m, along with moderate quantities of contemporary and later (early Islamic) ceramics including some diagnostic sherds, mostly rims, walls and handles. Although these finds occur within the familiar, yellow, coarse aeolian sands, they are found at remarkably consistent levels, and the earliest of them may well represent the ancient ground surface at the time of or shortly after the temple's abandonment in the first or second century AD. The wall clearly continued to collapse and erode into Islamic times; the Islamic sherds may further reflect the importance of the Sign Yusuf, only 200 m to the south, as a centre of pilgrimage. These layers form tip lines down to the north from the standing brick wall, and become notably denser and steeper at the lower levels. The lowest such layer reached dipped to over 5 m below ground level; at this point, following strong overnight winds, the trench edges began to collapse and excavation was abandoned for this season for health and safety reasons on 2 October. We feel that a positive start has been made to this phase of the survey, and that we now have a clear idea of the stratigraphic complexity and the scale of the logistical problems. In particular, we need to verify the observation of nearby sediment cores which suggest strongly that alluvial deposits formed very close to the escarpment before the first aeolian sand accumulations began, making the cliff face virtually sheer and especially dramatic. We have even suggested that the early designation 'White Wall(s)' for the town might be in reference not so much to an architectural feature as to the natural phenomenon of the light-coloured limestone cliffs which dominate both sides of the valley at this point. The intention is to continue and extend this exposure, using earth-moving equipment (with the permission of the Supreme Council for Antiquities) during 2003. Post-excavation analysis As well as being on hand to deal with plant remains from this year's excavation, Murray also continued to process archaeobotanical samples from the 1984-90 excavations at Kom Rabi'a (site code RAT). All thirty samples analysed this season date to the Middle Kingdom phase of the site, and will be published in the near future. DAVID JEFFREYS 9 2003</page><page sequence="10">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 Tell el-Amarna, 2003 THE season ran between 27 February and 15 April 2003. The staff comprised Barry Kemp (field director), Paul Buckland, Alan Clapham, Ann Cornwell, Suresh Dhargalkar, Jane Faiers, Helen Fenwick, Rainer Gerisch, Pamela Haywood, Dimitri Labouri, John MacGinnis, Gwilym Owen, Gillian Pyke, Pamela Rose, Corinna Rossi, Christopher Stevens and Kristin Thompson. The SCA inspector was Khallaf Fathi Nagib. A number of separate projects were pursued, some involving survey or excavation on the site itself, others based on material in store at the expedition house. It is again a pleasure to report a substantial donation from the Amama Research Foundation. ca -vydIouls lel i-l .-- . .-r,: : _ .., -.4 :- _x . ..'_ . :_y -'.' .'-". *.. _ _. . * - ... .:* - -_.. *' v&lt; .

The position of each of the rock tombs was fixed within a contour map of the hills in which they are situated. The network of ancient roads which criss-cross the desert plain has, in this area, grown very faint as a result of weathering and much recent vehicle use. Nevertheless traces of both systems of roads-those from the city to the tombs and those running north-south-were noted and included in the maps. The close attention paid to the desert surface in front of the tombs revealed scatters of human bones. They mainly lie to the north of the modern road leading to tomb 25, but also occur for a short distance to the south. Amongst the bone fragments are a few weathered sherds. To the north of the road these are primarily of the New Kingdom; to the south they seem mostly to be much later and might have been washed down from the Late Period sherd dumps outside tomb 25. At least part of the northern scatter of bones and sherds has been washed across the plain from a narrow wadi which runs between tombs 24 and 25. The scatter continues up the floor of the wadi for a distance of around half a kilometre until the location of the original cemetery is reached (fig. 1). It lies on a low desert terrace above the wadi. Over the years it has been gradually washed away as the wadi has flooded. A strip of the cemetery nonetheless still survives and is marked by pits where robbers have been at work. At one point some loose mud-bricks were noted, as well as a piece of wooden plank and at least one worked stone block. Many eroded sherds lie on the surface, and on a brief visit two of the pottery experts (Pamela Rose and Gillian Pyke) dated them to the Eighteenth Dynasty (probably the Amarna Period). They commented that there is a wider variety of vessels present than is the case with the northern cemeteries discovered in 2001, and that the collection as a whole perhaps points to burials of somewhat higher status. Sherds from amphorae occur, for example, which were not noted at the northern cemeteries. The position of the cemetery was added to the GPS survey and aerial photographs were taken with the aid of the expedition's small helium balloon. Old excavation dump beside the southern expedition house (South House Dump) The southern expedition house dates back to the early twentieth century and was used by the German expedition directed by Ludwig Borchardt and subsequently by the early seasons of the Egypt Exploration Society (those between 1921 and 1924). A small magazine for antiquities lay separately behind the house, of which only a small part of the southern end now remains standing. In 1992 it was discovered that when the EES ceased to use the house regularly in 1924, some of the contents of the magazine were buried in ground lying to the north. Further material was discovered in 2002. This year a larger surrounding area was examined to see if more remained. The ground where most of the previous finds had been discovered lay within a walled courtyard which had contained circular granaries with sunken floors. This year the full extent of the courtyard wall was uncovered. It enclosed a space measuring 16.5 x 14.5 m. On the east side lay 3 circular granaries with an average diameter of 3.4 m; on the west lay 4 similar but slightly smaller granaries. All of them had been built with their brick floors sunk into the desert by about 50 cm. Many of the earlier 2003 11</page><page sequence="12">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 finds had been within the two northernmost of the granaries on the east side. This year a strip 6 m wide was cleared on the west side of the courtyard. This brought to light a large quantity of Eighteenth Dynasty sherds lying within the sand over the southernmost of the four western granaries, together with a small collection of human bones. None of the sherds, however, carried labels from the 1920s excavation and their value is therefore less than the pottery discovered last year, which formed part of the original 1920s type-series of vessels. Closer to the site of the old magazine a group of seven stamped jar sealings was found in a rubble layer close to the present surface of the ground. A few fragments without worked surfaces which belong to the broken black granodiorite statue of Akhenaten and Nefertiti which is being reassembled in the expedition house (see below) were also found in the vicinity. A few more were collected on ground to the east, behind where the magazine had stood. A strip of ground was also cleaned here but produced no further material. House of Ranefer The investigation of Ranefer's house continued (supervised by John MacGinnis and Paul Buckland), uncovering more of the underlying house and also extending the excavation into the adjacent grounds on the north side (fig. 2). The deposits in several of the rooms of the upper house were removed to reveal the floors and walls of the lower house. Beneath the floor of Ranefer's outer hall (room 1) part of the northern external wall of the earlier house was located. In rooms 3 and 4/7 the outside eastern wall of the lower house was exposed, and a small area of well preserved mud-plastered ground from the outside courtyard. In room 5 the western outside wall of the lower house was exposed, and a larger area of the mud-plastered ground. This was interrupted by the sides of two circular granaries with slightly sunk floors which had been cut in two by Ranefer's later house wall. Also in room 5 the remains of the earlier house included an internal area of solid brickwork built against the outside wall. From its position it is likely that it is the foundations for a staircase to an upper floor. From what has now been recovered of the earlier house it looks as if it followed the plan of a smaller version of Ranefer's later house. This conclusion helps to explain groupings of bricks and marks on the mud- plaster also found beneath Ranefer's outer hall: they must belong to the outer end of an entrance staircase to the house, similar to the one later built by Ranefer further to the north. The northern part of the earlier house itself lay over more deeply buried deposits which must fill a large hole dug into the desert when the site first came to be occupied. This hole extends for an unknown distance to the north, beyond the limit of the later house. As a first step in exploring this aspect, an area of courtyard on the north was cleaned of its covering of sand. This revealed that the courtyard had been paved with mud-bricks in its later phase. However, where a hole had later been dug a thick wall of an earlier period is exposed, running east-west. This could be the remains of the courtyard enclosure wall of the earlier house. If so, this might imply that the northern part of Ranefer's later courtyard was also built over ground belonging to another older house. The earthy layers separating the two periods of building were sieved for the recovery of organic material as well as for small artefacts. The latter included another natural pebble bearing a short hieratic text, several small fragments of polished gypsum plaster 12 JEA 89</page><page sequence="13">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 House of Ranefer: phase 1 phase 2 entrance - 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 key phase 1 wall phase 1 wall (1921) phase 1 foo - i o ie s - walls in outline only belong to phase 2 8 9 10 X - Metres House of Ranefer: phase 2 2003 walls in outline only belong to phase 2 but are taken from the 1921 plan 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 - .- ... . --- - Metres FIG. 2.

The North Palace This year's work concentrated on the main central hall towards the back of the building which faced onto a large courtyard. The hall had been paved with mud-bricks and had been furnished with rows of columns standing on stone column bases. Only two of the bases survive, both in the north-east corner. They are of slightly different diameters and materials (limestone and sandstone) even though they are adjacent and belong to the same row. The positions of the remaining column bases were ascertained by the original excavators in the 1920s on the basis of patches of damage to the brick floor, some of which have remained visible as shallow rounded depressions in the cover of dust which has developed over the years. In contrast to normal ancient Egyptian practice, the column bases seem not to have been arranged in even parallel rows but to have consisted of an inner and an outer set, the former placed at slightly wider intervals, presumably indicating that the roof of the central part of the hall was higher. As part of the development plan the central hall was completely cleaned during the 2003 season (pl. II, 1). The dust covering the remains of the brick floor was swept away to expose the places where the column bases had been, and the layer of earth covering a large expanse of gypsum foundations at the front of the hall was also removed and the gypsum swept clean. In common with other stone-built elements at Amarna, this foundation still bears many impressions of the lowest course of stone blocks, the original blocks having been removed shortly after the end of the Amarna Period. Such foundations and block impressions are precious evidence for the design of stone architecture at Amarna. Here at the North Palace a stone platform had been built out from the front of the hall. Ramps or staircases had evidently led up to it from both sides, and a third had started its ascent actually within the hall itself. The presence of this internal ramp probably explains the unusual arrangement of the columns. When the central hall was first excavated in 1923 the lower part of a wall-painting was found on the east wall to the north of the central doorway. It preserved the feet and legs of a procession of human figures above a dado consisting of vertical painted lines and formal plant designs. All that survives now are small portions of the dado, which have been protected by sand banked against them. In order to photograph them the sand was removed. This revealed also patches of paint on a narrow strip of mud plaster which covers the mud-brick floor. This seems to be an accidentally preserved area of a layer of mud plaster which had originally been spread over the entire floor but has otherwise been eroded away. The surface of the flooring bricks was slightly irregular. They had been covered with a thin layer of mud plaster enriched with chopped straw, often only 2 mm in thickness, increasing to 4 mm, but in one place thinning to nothing so that the paint was applied directly to the protruding surface of small pebbles embedded in the bricks. In a few places this floor-plaster still joins directly with the much thicker mud wall-plaster, which often reaches 2 cm in thickness. Traces of yellow and blue paint from the floor design run across the join at one point. At another point the wall-plaster overlaps the floor-plaster and its covering of paint showing that the floor had been painted before the wall was plastered. The wall-plaster itself had been spread not JEA 89 14</page><page sequence="15">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 directly over the bricks of the wall but over a thin layer of gypsum plaster. One place was preserved where it can be seen that this white underlay had also been applied over a small area where the coloured floor paint had risen for a few millimetres up the wall. The floor paint was in a poor powdery condition and rarely present in more than small spots. It nevertheless survives in this condition over a length of 5.50 m, representing the greater part of the distance between the north-east corner of the hall and the edge of the large central doorway. A few spots (yellow and red) are preserved at between 12.85 and 13.30 m from the north-east corner, along the edge of the wall to the south of the central doorway, where erosion has been more severe. It is thus reasonable to conclude that the floor-painting was continuous alontinuous along the whole east side of the hall. The colours used were yellow, red, orange, blue, turquoise, black and a dark green. Yellow was the colour most frequently present, probably because it was used as a base colour over which other colours were painted. This was visibly the case wherever red was used, probably the second most common colour. The best preserved part was a patch of dark green measuring about 10 x 3 cm on which small red spots had been painted. Otherwise no individual design could be made out, and in particular, no trace was visible of black outlining to design elements. This narrow strip of largely eroded floor-painting is a significant addition to our knowledge of the finished appearance of Amarna palaces. Hitherto the principal evidence for floor decoration has been the rare cases of painted gypsum surfaces. With these the painted designs were added to a thick layer of gypsum plaster which is more resistant to decay and destruction and therefore leaves more positive traces in the archaeological record. Previous excavators reported finding only three groups in position. Two were in the eastern wing of the Great Palace: the throne-room complex of the 'North Harim' (the fragments of which form an exhibit in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo), and rooms to the south of it and in the 'South Harim'; the third was in one of the buildings in the Maru-Aten enclosure. In recent years three further instances have come to light in other buildings, but all reduced to small loose fragments. These are: (a) the King's House: fragments picked from Pendlebury's spoil-heap adjacent to the central columned hall. 1 The most likely source is one or more of the halls themselves, but the interior of this building has not been re-examined by us; (b) the Great Palace, the southern building 042.2: a small number of fragments were discovered in 1996 associated with an early phase of the palace which was destroyed to its foundations to make way for the Smenkhkara Hall; (c) the South Pavilion at Kom el-Nana: a quantity of fragments was found along with a deposit of rubbish (mostly pottery) which had been used as filling-material for a sunken garden. It is still not clear whether this debris was thrown in during or after the Amarna Period. It is noteworthy that no trace of a painted gypsum floor has been found at the North Palace. It is unlikely that in palaces and the houses of the elite the mud-brick floors of the interior rooms were left unpainted. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, plain white is the safest suggestion. Occasionally some of the whitewash has remained, as in the case of the building MIV at Maru-Aten where in at least one room (the bedroom), so we are told by the excavators, the floor had been simply whitewashed.2 In one of the better preserved of the large Amarna private houses, that belonging to the vizier Nakht, I F. Weatherhead, 'Wall-Paintings from the King's House at Amarna', JEA 81 (1995), 104-6. 2 T. E. Peet and C. L. Woolley, The City of Akhenaten, I (MEES 38; London, 1923), 116 (hereafter COA I). 2003 15</page><page sequence="16">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 the excavators reported that the floors had been whitewashed, but the intriguing observation was also made that one of the floors (they do not say which one) had subsequently been replastered with mud and 'had been painted in bright colours, of which only traces of red and yellow remained'.3 In another house, R44.1, there was evidence of several layers of paint on the floor, at least one of which was blue.4 The new evidence from the North Palace opens up the likelihood that decorative painting on a suitably prepared mud surface over a mud-brick floor was an option that could be taken up in palaces, as well as in the houses of the elite. This helps to fill an otherwise awkward gap in our knowledge of decorative schemes, especially at the North Palace where so far it has seemed that, in contrast to the richness of the wall paintings, no decoration was applied to floors. What those decorative schemes might have been remains, however, quite uncertain. Apart from the comments quoted in the last paragraph, our only knowledge of floor painting comes from the well known gypsum palace floors. Both those from the Great Palace and those from Maru-Aten were surrounded by a narrow band of plain yellow paint.5 The newly discovered traces at the North Palace seem to represent an initial covering of yellow paint with other colours painted over it. One possibility is that the other colours do not belong to the original scheme but signal a later repainting. In this case the yellow could represent the same plain edge band to areas of design that lay further out into the floor and are now wholly lost. The best guess is that the latter resembled the plant, animal and pond life of the gypsum floors. That would still leave the multi-coloured repainting as something quite different, though the quotation in the last paragraph concerning the house of the vizier Nakht suggests that this example was not unique. The best preserved area at the North Palace, as already noted, consisted of irregular red spots on a dark green background but not far away were larger continuous patches of both black and red. So narrow is the strip that has survived, however, that these could also have belonged only to an edging to the main designs, now lost, rather than have been representative of a more abstract kind of design which covered the whole floor. The main aim of the 2003 season was to carry out limited restoration of the central hall. Once the floor had been cleaned and photographed from the air (using a low-level helium-filled balloon) the work began of marking the positions of the missing column bases with circular pads of white cement cast from an iron mould. In total thirteen were completed, leaving seven to be done next year. On each of these pads a column base of the correct ancient dimensions will be cast next year from a newly made mould. Over the site of the gypsum foundation layer a thick bed of sand was laid down. This will provide the necessary foundation for the laying of a single course of limestone blocks next season, to the exact shape of the ancient masonry. The southern and eastern walls of the central hall have largely been eroded away. To help define the hall better they have been built up again for a few courses in new bricks made to the ancient size. 3 COA I, 6. 4 H.

On the south side of the first court a long section of the brick enclosure wall has seemed to be missing and has been used as a means of vehicle access to the temple. The line of the wall was cleared of sand at this point and a portion of the foundations of the wall, with two of its buttresses, was found to have survived. The desert slopes down slightly to the north, and to allow for this the courses of bricks which formed the foundations had also been stepped down, and what mostly survived was this lower step which is much narrower than the original full width of the wall. Once these remains had been planned and photographed, the line of the wall was built up for several courses in order to complete the visible sides of the enclosure and to close the gap. Further repairs were carried out to the north-west corner area of the enclosure wall. The temple possessed three pairs of mud-brick pylons separated by unusually wide gateways. We know from our previous excavations that each of these gateways, and the pairs of small flanking gateways, were originally floored with stone on a gypsum foundation. None of the original stonework survives. In a plan to replace it with new stone blocks, as a way of defining the outlines of the temple more clearly and of marking the use of stone, the gateway between the first pair of pylons was completely floored with new limestone blocks cut to the ancient size and laid using white cement. The ancient gypsum layers showed traces of a raised central area which might have been the basis for a platform reached by ramps. The shape of the raised area was also reproduced in stone, at the level of a second course. Once this was completed a threshold of limestone blocks was also laid in the southern smaller gateway in the front wall of the temple enclosure. Amarna statuary project The expedition has in store at Amarna a large number of fragments of statues of the Amarna Period. Most of them have been recovered from two dumps left by previous expeditions which we have for convenience labelled 'South House Dump' and 'North House Dump'. The former lies directly behind the current house used by the expedition; the latter is situated at some distance behind the ruins of the old Egypt Exploration Society house in the North City, opposite the North Riverside Palace. Considerable progress was made this year in sorting the material and finding matches within the substantial number of pieces that have emerged from both of these sources. In addition, geologist Pamela Haywood, who joined the team to study the types of stone among the querns discovered on the site, also helped to assign firm identifications to the material used in the sculpture fragments. In the case of the South House Dump, during 2000 Kristin Thompson had found that 188 pieces of shattered dark-grey granodiorite all came from an unfinished, two-thirds life-size statue of Akhenaten and Nefertiti seated side by side. During that season she made over sixty joins, initiating a reconstruction of the statue that has continued over the subsequent two seasons, with a total of close to a hundred matches made so far. Although perhaps half of the statue's material is missing, the several large sections that have resulted from the reconstruction constitute the most extensively preserved statue with a firm provenance at Amarna. 2003 17</page><page sequence="18">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 In July 2002 Thompson visited the Agyptisches Museum in Berlin in order to study the extensive collection of pieces excavated by Borchardt at Amarna and with the hope of finding evidence of the provenance of the South House Dump material in Borchardt's excavation diary. An entry in his diary for 13 December 1912 makes reference to 'black granite pieces' of an unfinished, two-thirds life-size, seated pair statue of the royal couple, found shattered into many pieces and lying in rooms 6, 10 and 12 of house P47.3, a small building at the rear of the sculptor Thutmose's workshop complex. Near the pieces Borchardt's team found a head of Nefertiti of the same material, also in an unfinished state. This well-known head was taken to Berlin in 1913 and is now exhibited under the inventory number 21358. Subsequently Dietrich Wildung, director of the Berlin Museum, kindly provided a cast of 21358 which could be taken to Amarna. Early in the 2003 season the cast of the head was compared with the original pieces. The break at the lower back of this head proved a perfect match for the break on the top piece of Nefertiti's back pillar. This proved that the granodiorite statue was indeed found by Borchardt's team and was a product of the Thutmose workshop. Further evidence turned up in the form of a large piece with a flat surface that had been picked up during a study of stone querns made in 1992 and kept in store among the querns at the site magazine. A small piece from the South House Dump fits it, and Delwen Samuel, who had conducted the quern survey, provided information that this piece had been picked up in the Thutmose complex. A brief investigation of the surface in that complex turned up an even larger piece of the base, as well as several unworked pieces of matrix and a small worked fragment which proved to be Akhenaten's right ankle and fits onto a substantial portion of the pair statue. The South House Dump had also contained hundreds of fragments of variously coloured quartzite, travertine (alabaster) and other stones. Dimitri Laboury, of the Universite de Liege, joined the expedition this season to study the statuary fragments. He added to information gathered by Thompson in Berlin, demonstrating that several other pieces from the dump relate to those in the Agyptisches Museum. Thus the statuary material from this dump appears to consist in part or in whole of pieces from the Thutmose complex left behind by Borchardt as not of museum quality. Laboury and team member Corinna Rossi collaborated in creating a digital image of the statue's various sections joined and arranged to give a good sense of the two figures' original appearance (pl. II, 2). This image will also be of use in future work. The physical reconstruction of the statue will continue next season, along with an investigation of how the various large portions might be mounted for display. The statuary fragments from the North House Dump near the north expedition house, used by the Egypt Exploration Society in the 1930s, have been recovered in stages. In 1981, after it was noticed that pieces were coming to the surface as a result of wind and rain erosion, a preliminary clearance was made of the visible pieces. All of these 210 statuary fragments, mostly in pink granite and quartzite, were sent in crates to the Egyptian Museum, where they remained in storage. Erosion then brought more pieces to the surface, and in 1992 these were retrieved and stored in the site magazine at Amarna. In 2001, when Thompson began the reconstruction of the granodiorite dyad, a request was made to the SCA and the Museum for the return of the original group of fragments, with a view toward possible matching within that material as well. Permission was granted, and two crates arrived at Amarna at the end of the 2002 season. 18 JEA 89</page><page sequence="19">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 At the same time Thompson supervised a further one-day clearance of the North House Dump, resulting in the recovery of hundreds of additional pieces. During the 2003 season the two crates of material from the Museum were unpacked, sorted and put into numbered trays for later registration. Almost immediately matches among pieces from the Egyptian Museum became apparent: between two pieces of quartzite representing what appears to be a Hathoric feather from the crown of a large- scale statue, and between two pieces of quartzite from a stretch of pleat-covered body surface. Further matches will undoubtedly occur in future seasons, when this material from the Museum can be compared with the many other pieces removed from the North House Dump. Near the end of this season, Thompson supervised a fourth clearance of the Dump, again resulting in hundreds of pink granite, quartzite, limestone and travertine pieces being added to those already in the magazine. Future seasons will be devoted to bringing the registration of these many recovered pieces-perhaps in the neighborhood of a thousand-to a conclusion and to looking for joins among them. In general, the many statuary fragments from the two dumps, along with a much smaller number of pieces found during excavations in the Kom el-Nana enclosure, the Small Aten Temple and elsewhere, enormously expand the information on the statuary programme in the ancient city. The original provenance of these pieces is now remarkably well understood, given that they came from dumps. The South House Dump primarily represents unfinished pieces from the Thutmose workshop. The North House Dump apparently consisted in large part or in whole of pieces excavated by John Pendlebury's expedition during the 1934-5 and 1935-6 seasons. Numerous labelled ostraca buried along with the statuary all indicate a provenance in the Palace, and several of the stone pieces are marked 'PAL' in ink, an abbreviation for the Great Palace. (The quartzite, travertine and granite pieces have no labels of any kind.) In conjunction with this work, Thompson is also studying statuary fragments from Amarna held in museums throughout the world. The end result should be a much clearer picture of what types of statues were created and displayed in the buildings of the ancient city. Pottery study The main direction of this season's Eighteenth Dynasty pottery study was the completion of the Amarna pottery corpus, by taking in the many vessels from the 1920s excavations which were found last year buried beside the expedition house. They had been broken, necessitating much work of restoration (Ann Cornwell), and have required photography (G. Owen) and new drawings (Pamela Rose and Gillian Eastwood). The total of vessels so added amounts to about two hundred. Additional recording of the Late Roman pottery from Kom el-Nana was completed, ready for the second volume of the Late Roman pottery corpus (the first volume is in press). Coptic wall plaster This season saw the completion of the analysis by Gillian Pyke of the many fragments of painted wall-plaster recovered during the excavation in 2000 of the eastern end of the church at the monastic site at Kom el-Nana. More joins were made to the groups created during study in the 2002 season, including matching a head to an upper body, and adding a third figure to the largest group. This section of plaster is now around 1.3 m 19 2003</page><page sequence="20">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 long, and consists of three male figures, from left to right wearing green, pink and gold cloaks. The last of these figures has two scratched graffiti on his cloak and tunic. Further inscribed fragments were added to a second gold-cloaked figure, while more green cloak was added to a poorly represented figure standing next to another gold- cloaked figure holding a key. In Coptic iconography, the key is associated with St Peter. More joins were made to the very fragmentary white-cloaked figure (perhaps of Christ) associated with a green wheel that possibly belongs to a chariot. Characteristics of the painting style and colours on each figure were used to suggest relationships between groups where no further joins were possible. The gold-cloaked figure with the graffito, of which the lower cloak and tunic above the hem are preserved, was matched to a right arm raised in benediction on the basis of the use of red as well as black on the cuff of the sleeve and the tunic. Additional fragments attributed to this figure included a left shoulder and parts of the lower left side of the cloak, including an additional graffito, and a scroll. The head and upper body of a green-cloaked figure and upraised arm of a pink-cloaked figure probably belong with the left and central figures of the large group on the basis of painting techniques and colours. Fragments of inscribed labels positioned between the feet of the figures have been identified. One of these, associated with a gold-cloaked figure, reads 'Andreas' (St Andrew). Another inscription, located between the feet of the green-cloaked figure in the group of three, has been tentatively read as 'Joanis' (St John) and the fragmentary inscription between the feet of the pink-cloaked figure next to him might be read 'Jakobos' (St James). Another inscription, similarly placed, ends '...eos' (St Bartholemew, St Matthew or St Thaddaeus?). These inscriptions and the presence of a key suggesting that St Peter is also represented all suggest that these figures are the twelve Apostles, who are often shown flanking the Virgin Mary. Although no clear indications of the presence of this figure have been found, fragments of what might be a dark red cloak, usually worn by the Virgin Mary in Coptic art, are present, though no joins have been made between them. On the basis of these new pieces of evidence, it can be suggested that the scenes in the apse of the church consist of the twelve Apostles, perhaps flanking the Virgin Mary, with the figure of Christ in a chariot above. The large groups of fragments were cleaned with distilled water, consolidated using Paraloid B72 and glued together in sections with Primal (Rhopolex) SY27C (B60A). The colours used in each group were recorded using a Pantone colour chart, giving a colour palette for this area of the church. Each group was then recorded epigraphically using clear acetate, and photographed. Smaller identifiable fragments were also recorded in the same way. New trays were purchased for the permanent storage of the plaster, the larger fragments of which were bedded on clean sand to support the fragile pieces. The small fragments were also stored in trays, bedded in plastosote-foam cut to fit each group. Two large boxes of wall plaster collected during the 1994 excavation season were also examined and an inventory made of the contents. These are from areas outside the church, chiefly the adjacent courtyard. Though the colours used are similar, there is little evidence that there are any figures represented. Several fragments appear to be decorated with floral motifs and there are pieces of two red inscriptions. These latter fragments were cleaned, consolidated and photographed. A full analysis of this plaster will be the subject of a future study season. 20 JEA 89</page><page sequence="21">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 Environmental material Further progress was made in the identification of specimens of plant material (C. Stevens and A. Clapham), of wood and shrub species from charcoal (R. Gerisch) and of insects (P. Buckland). The sieving of all deposits from Ranefer's house has added much material. BARRY KEMP Qasr Ibrim, 2003 THE Qasr Ibrim season this year comprised two parts: a study season, based in Shellal, which took place between 27 January and 23 March, and a brief period of fieldwork at the site between 6 and 14 February. The study season team consisted of the author, Alan Clapham, Peter French, Adrian England, Gillian Pyke, Andre Veldmeijer, Bridget Leach, and Hans-Werner Fischer-Elfert. The SCA inspector for the study season was Salwa Fuad Sherif, whose cheerful and willing assistance is gratefully acknowledged, as is the help provided by the Chief Inspector of Aswan, Mohi el-Din M. Ahmed. The fieldwork team consisted of Rose, Clapham, and conservators Eric Miller and David Singleton. The SCA was represented by Osama Abdel Latif and Hassan Abdel Moneim Mohammed (SCA conservator). Their assistance in difficult conditions is gratefully acknowledged. Thanks are also due to Peter Jones and the engineers of Skanska Cementation International Ltd, based in Toshka, who provided transportation to and from the site. Fieldwork The aim of the work at Qasr Ibrim was to remove a Twenty-fifth Dynasty wall-painting threatened by water percolation resulting from the high level of Lake Nasser. It was situated in a small mud-brick temple in the southern part of the site, first excavated in the early 1970s (fig. 1).1 The temple consisted of a court in which were four inscribed stone columns, behind which was a centrally-placed sanctuary, surrounded by long thin chambers on three sides. Paintings were found on the north-west and north-east sanctuary walls, and in the north-western of the surrounding chambers was found a well- preserved wooden staircase. The discovery in 1995 of a number of large stone blocks decorated with figures of Taharqa in front of various gods suggests that the temple originally extended further south-westwards than now preserved, and had a decorated gateway or kiosk in this area. The temple building remained in use over a long period. Although it seems to have been abandoned for some time after the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, as attested by the many holes in the sanctuary walls, some of which were clearly made by rodents at a time when the chamber was filled with rubbish, it was in sufficiently good condition by the period of Meroitic occupation to be restored and incorporated into the main Meroitic temple, perhaps as a side chapel. At this time the holes in the sanctuary walls were repaired by 1 J. M. Plumley and W. Y. Adams, 'Qasr Ibrim, 1972', JEA 60 (1974), 228-36; J. M. Plumley, 'Qasr Ibrim, 1974', JEA 61 (1975), 19-20. 2003 21</page><page sequence="22">FTrITLDWORK, 2002-03 Ifi =7+- FIG. 1. Line drawing of the Taharqa temple. filling the larger ones with stones set in straw-rich mud plaster, and the smaller ones just with plaster, and the walls were then given several coats of whitewash over time. The restoration can be dated by Meroitic graffiti scratched into the lowest coat of whitewash. At the same time, the staircase chamber behind the sanctuary went out of use, and was infilled with debris. Eventually the temple was converted into a church, and an apse was inserted into the front part of the sanctuary. The area behind it was infilled with debris, and it is to this that we owe the preservation of the chamber. The 1972 and 1974 excavation seasons uncovered paintings on the north-east and north-west walls of the sanctuary. The south-east wall was in too poor a state for any I 22 JEA 89</page><page sequence="23">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 decoration to remain, and the putative south-east wall, with the entrance to the sanctuary, was removed when the apse was constructed. The paintings were executed on a coat of white paint over a layer of pink plaster, itself covering a layer of mud plaster coating the brickwork of the walls. The decoration, consisting on each wall of the pharaoh Taharqa, named in the inscriptions, before a god, was drafted in red, but there is no evidence for the use of a grid to lay out the design. The paint was applied directly to the surface, except on the limbs of the gods' figures. In these, the area representing the skin was slightly hollowed out and separately filled with a thicker deposit of pink plaster, on which the paint was then laid. The technique was clear from the way that the filler plaster had fallen away from some parts of the surface. It does not seem to represent a modification of the original design, and may perhaps be connected to the use of a thick, granular blue pigment for the god's skin, which from the way it has disappeared particularly from the figure on the north-east wall, does not adhere well to the surface. The painting on the north-east wall was already much damaged when first discovered, but preserves parts of two figures, an anthropomorphic god facing right, and the king facing him (pl. III, 1). The published drawing of the painting was made before the painting was fully exposed,2 but shows that behind the god (incorrectly identified in the caption as the king) were two columns of inscription and a chequered border. The full exposure of the wall, which is documented only in three colour slides, shows that the god must have had his left arm raised and extended towards the king's head. The king stands before the god, holding a baton in his left hand, and with his right arm slightly bent away from the body. Between the king and the god is an area of damage, but as it appears to include a cartouche, it is likely that there was an inscription between the figures, as on the north-west wall. Behind the king's figure there is room for another two columns of inscription and a border, but only very slight traces remain of the hieroglyphs in the first of these. Full clearance of the wall also exposed the base line on which the figures stood. The painting on the north-west wall was better preserved, and shows Taharqa before a blue-bodied god, probably Amun (pl. III, 2).3 Both figures have a single column of inscription behind them, and a chequered border defines the edge of the scene at the corner. The removal of the apse inserted into the sanctuary in the course of this year's work showed that the painting extended further to the south-west, beyond the area previously documented. The new area was particularly damaged and had been extensively repaired in the Meroitic Period, but sufficient traces are visible to make the presence of a further scene certain, although the interpretation is as yet unclear. A preliminary examination suggests that the scene included another figure with red flesh, facing the entrance to the sanctuary, and perhaps wearing a double crown. Between the excavation seasons in 1998 and 2000, the north-east wall of the sanctuary was undermined by water action from the new high water level in Lake Nasser. It collapsed, and dissolved, along with much of the mud-brick architecture forming the rest of the temple. All that remained standing was the lower left-hand corner of the scene, preserving part of the border and the bottom of the two columns of inscription. The north-west sanctuary wall remained standing, but was clearly threatened if the water level should reach the same height again. In 2000, therefore, we 2 Plumley and Adams, JEA 60, pl. xlix. 1. 3 Plumley, JEA 61, 20 and pl. xii. 23 2003</page><page sequence="24">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 re-cleared the surviving painting of its protective backfill, to establish its condition, and we found that the effects of water percolation were clearly visible as a darkened area extending to above the figures' knee-level. It was therefore decided to remove the painting from the site, and after some delays in obtaining the relevant permissions, the project was undertaken in February of this year. Fortunately, the painting had suffered little further damage in the meantime: the line marking the level of water percolation was a few centimetres higher, but otherwise it was intact. Removal of the painting was a complex and uncomfortable procedure due to the conditions on site and the dangerous nature of the materials used, which necessitated wearing masks and gloves for much of the time. As a first step, the painting was given three coats of Cyclododecane wax dissolved in petroleum spirit. This consolidated the surface, penetrating a few millimetres into the backing plaster layers. Once this was done, a wooden frame the size of the painting (about two metres high by three metres wide) was fitted a short distance in front of the consolidated face. The frame was lined with alternating layers of foam strips and wooden battens, and as these were built up, polyurethane foam was cast into the gap between the battens and the face. Once set, this formed a protective layer bonding the consolidated surface to the frame. The wall on which the painting was placed was then dismantled. This revealed some very well preserved examples of matting, made from halfa-grass culms bound together by a single row of palm-fibre string, which were laid between every fourth course of brickwork, on one of which layers was found a reed pen. Wall removal also showed that when the Meroites repaired the damage to the sanctuary, they deposited some small objects in the cavities along with the stones and mud plaster. These included gold-in- glass beads, a mould for a wadjet-eye amulet, and part of an iron ring shank with a stone or glass bezel, into which was carved a fine bearded head. In the course of removing the wall, the upper part of the wooden staircase found in 1972 was re-exposed.4 The stairs, 28 cm deep and 14-16 cm high, were made from mud-brick edged with reused, roughly squared, palm timbers, which made up the entire height of the riser and extended some 75 cm back into the chamber walls. Five steps were exposed in the current season's work, but the stairs certainly continue below the level reached, and when originally discovered ten steps were present. This lower area is now damp, and it is uncertain whether the steps will have survived. The walls of the stair chamber were coated with the same pink plaster as was found in the sanctuary, but were undecorated. Once the wall was demolished, all that remained standing was a thin skin of consolidated material, consisting of the painted face and underlying plaster layers, attached to the wooden frame by the polyurethane foam. This was then laid flat, and wooden edges were added to the sides of the frame to build up a box into which further polyurethane foam could be cast to protect the back of the painting. Finally, the box was closed with a wooden lid. The painting was removed from Qasr Ibrim to Toshka, the nearest road head, with the assistance of Skanska Cementation International Ltd., which company provided a tug boat with a built-in crane to lift the extremely heavy and unwieldy box off the island. It was taken by road back to the Nubian Museum in Aswan, and is now in store in the magazine there. Next year it is hoped that the expedition's conservators will return to the museum to begin to prepare the painting for future display. 4 Plumley and Adams, JEA 60, 231 and pl. xlix.2. 24 JEA 89</page><page sequence="25">FIELDWORK, 2002-03 The study season The study season was based in SCA magazines in Shellal, where the expedition's finds and equipment are stored. It saw continued research on material from the 2000 excavation season, particularly pottery and archaeobotanical remains from Napatan and Meroitic levels, and further study of the cordage from the site. A new project was the restoration and study of the Napatan papyrus fragments from Trench 23, also discovered in 2000. This project saw, firstly, the conservation and restoration of the fragments, undertaken by Bridget Leach of The British Museum. The pieces were, on the whole, in good condition, and little affected by damp, and it was possible to make a large number of joins between fragments. Leach notes that it is uncertain how many documents are preserved amongst the material. Usually, the individual sheets that join to make a papyrus roll occur approximately every 20 cm, and an overlap is visible on the surface. There are nine pieces with sheet joins visible on them amongst the Qasr Ibrim material. Three of the fragments are relatively large (15 x 15 cm, 12 x 15 cm and 12 x 10 cm), and it is likely that some of the smaller ones form part of the same joins, indicating that there are at least four separate sheets of papyrus present. A preliminary study of the reconstructed texts was made by Hans-Werner Fischer- Elfert.5 They are written in abnormal hieratic, in use from the late Twenty-fifth to the late Twenty-sixth Dynasty, and appear administrative in nature. They contain long lists of personal names with filiations back to the grandfather's generation. Many of the names are of Libyan origin, as is evidenced by the presence of such names as Masaharta and (Ankh)-Shishak amongst others. The purpose of the lists is not yet clear. Fischer-Elfert also studied two joining pieces of text, which together make up a complete text of a magical nature.6 The text is amuletic, and was composed for a woman called Naqa, born to Hatj. In it, several decans are called upon to extend their protection over the owner of the spell, and three vignettes, showing anthropomorphic figures with feline heads, two on the inside (the recto) and one on the outside (the verso), are intended to enforce the spell's efficacy. An interesting point is that the text contains some hitherto unattested phrases, which may represent local Nubian concepts.
