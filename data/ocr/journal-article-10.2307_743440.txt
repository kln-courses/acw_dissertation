<plain_text><page sequence="1">iI Love of the Censor: Legendre, Censorship, and the Theater of the Basoche Stephanie Lysyk "How does one cleave to a text, how does adhesion to the truth of the text occur, and by what subtle artifice can one amorously enjoy a text?": so asks the jurist and psychoanalyst Pierre Legendre, enigmatically but not untypically, in one of his Lefons.' Legendre's work, which serves as the springboard for the issues to be raised here, concerns the law as an insti- tution whose history is inseparable from its textual corpora, its projections, and its images. It also addresses the law in the more expansive psychoan- alytical sense as that which possesses and binds the subject and as that of which no subject (as Lacan wrote, reworking the juridical maxim) can plead ignorance.2 The tacit project of Legendre's jurisprudence is to locate what, on the analogy of Freud's notion of the dream's navel, one might term the navel of the law: the tangle of thoughts and images which can- not be unravelled, the spot where the law reaches down into the unknown.3 What follows is an illustration of one aspect of Legendre's work - his notion of the love of the censor - as it played itself out in histrionic fashion in early modern French legal and literary history. It is at the same time a reflection on a single instance of what Peter Goodrich has identified as a series of "minor jurisprudences" punctuating the histo- ry of law in the western world. The comic spectacles composed and performed by the Basoche, that is, by the association of law clerks appren- ticing with established lawyers at the Parlement of Paris and other major courts in France, constituted a theatrical genre of law or legal genre of the- ater which has been almost forgotten today but which occupied a pivotal position in the emergence of the legal and theatrical institutions in France at the end of the fifteenth century.4 How the Basoche farce came to be among the first targets of the censor in early modern France is the ques- tion to be posed here. 113</page><page sequence="2">L Rebirth of the Censor The Polish novelist Witold Gombrowicz's first published work - a short story entitled "Master Kraykowski's Dancer" - opens with the fol- lowing scene.' The narrator has come to see, for the thirty-fourth time, his favorite operetta. Unfazed by the long line to buy tickets, he thrusts past everyone to a position right in front of the ticket booth. Just as he is asking the ticket seller for his usual seat, a fist grabs hold of him by the scruff of the neck and hurls him back to his proper place at the end of the line. After gathering himself together, the mortified narrator turns to face the man who has disciplined him in so imperious a fashion; but instead of challenging his castigator, the narrator, inexplicably, finds himself falling in love. His heart pounds, his body trembles, and he can't tear him eyes away from his persecutor, whom he later learns is the lawyer Kraykowski. As the story unfolds, the disastrous consequences of the nar- rator's passion - conceived in one brief but voluptuous moment of chastisement, and pursued with the masochistic obsession of a trouba- dour poet - are played out. That Kraykowski, the object of the narrator's desire, should be a lawyer is, of course, not fortuitous. The fascination which Master Kraykowski exerts on the fragile narrator is rooted in the lawyer's embod- iment of the straight, the correct, the orderly, and the powerful. Master Kraykowski is the very incarnation of the law, and the narrator's amour de loin for him is simultaneously what Legendre would term l'amour du censeur: that is, the subject's love of the censor, which is also the vicarious enjoyment of the censor's power, and the submission which becomes a desire for submission, upon which the individual's relation to the law is necessarily premised.6 If I introduce via Gombrowicz's tale this idea of the censor's fatal attraction, central to Legendre's work, it is because I want to anchor it in an image and in a fiction. This might seem counter-productive, since images and fictions never "anchor" anything but rather set a train of thought in motion without worrying about its final destination. Yet I think it is necessary because Legendre's concepts are themselves funda- mentally fictional in the sense that they consistently function on at least two levels - the literal-historical plane, on the one hand, and the metaphorical-psychoanalytical plane, on the other - which cannot 114</page><page sequence="3">simultaneously be captured in a straightforward, linear exposition. In fact, it is this constant oscillation between the two layers of meaning that makes Legendre's work unique, perhaps even in relation to his masters Lacan and Freud for whom the historical reading rarely threatens to take precedence over the psychoanalytical message. By rooting his studies in a specific time and place - for instance, with regard to the love of the cen- sor, in France during the late eleventh through thirteenth centuries - Legendre historicizes the practices and procedures of the psyche. In Republican Rome, the censors's primary duty was to record the private wealth of each citizen for the census. In a secondary but no less powerful role, deriving from their unlimited and unchecked power in the operation of the census, the censors enjoyed "the right to exercise maxi- mum control [haute surveillance] over the mores of all classes of the State."7 Although termed magistrates, the censors, as Barry Nicholas writes, "had no direct concern with the law, but they exercised a general supervision over morals which might form an important supplement to the law."8 In short, the censors acted as a sort of externalized conscience for the community. Moved by the ill fame surrounding the person, by the denunciation of a third party, or simply by intimate conviction, the cen- sors could summon an individual before their board and submit him to questioning. If the proceedings revealed public or private conduct judged dangerous to the material or moral welfare of the Republic, the individ- ual's name would be marked in the census register, thereby officially branding him with ignominia and excluding him from certain privileges of citizenship. While the office of the censor as such died together with the Roman Republic, the censorial function reentered European society obliquely during what Legendre calls the "revolution of the interpreter," that is, during the reception of classical Roman law in the work of the early civil- ian and canonist jurists. In fact, the spread of Christianity and the development of the Roman church ensured that this art of law and sur- veillance never fully disappeared. In medieval Europe the censor was reincarnated in the form of the pontiff and his agents, inspectors of the soul and guardians of orthodoxy. Legendre's censor is most closely affili- ated with these latter figures: that is, with the Absolute's representatives on earth in their role as magistrates of morals, and with the canon law jurists in particular, born of the reintegration of Roman law into chris- 115</page><page sequence="4">tianized Europe. Although Legendre presents his work in L'amour du censeur as a gloss on Freud, Freud's own censor is a different and perhaps less charismatic creature. Freud portrays his censor as a bureaucrat in the Kafkaesque style, tucked away in his office, his desk cluttered with dreams and memories, busily snipping out and crossing through all the segments that fail to meet with approval from the powers that be.' In a familiar passage from the Introductory Lectures, Freud uses a dream reported by one of his older female patients - the "love service" dream, during which the precise words of the dreamer's patriotic offer to provide for the libidinal needs of troops during wartime are reduced to an indistinct mumbling - in order to broach the subject of the censor in the following terms: You will, I hope, think it plausible to suppose that it was precisely the objectionable nature of these passages that was the motive for their suppression. Where shall we find a parallel to such an event? You need not look far in these days. Take up any political newspaper and you will find that here and there the text is absent and in its place nothing except the white paper is to be seen. This, as you know, is the work of the press censorship. In these empty places there was something that displeased the higher censorship authorities and for that reason it was removed - a pity, you feel, since no doubt it was the most inter- esting thing in the paper - the "best bit."10 The model for Freud's censor, in other words, is that powerful but anonymous government official whose role it is to suppress texts, repre- sentations, or the circulation of information generally, in the name of the political and moral welfare of the state. It would be misleading to overstate the contrast between the ecclesi- astical inspector of behavior and intimate thought, on the one hand, and the state-employed censor of texts and information, on the other. Legendre in fact connected the two in L'amour du censeur by reflecting on the role played by dogma and ritual not only in securing the individual's subjection to the mechanisms of power (a theme Foucault would develop a year later in his Surveiller et punir), but in bringing off the more diffi- cult feat: the subject's adoration of and possession by the censor as 116</page><page sequence="5">incarnated in emblematicized figures of the law. Historically speaking, as well, the various styles of censorship - ecclesiastical and temporal, repressive and preventive - overlapped in complex ways. Repressive or post-publication censorship was not unknown in the classical world and later frequently served the Church's purposes. Yet according to Milton in his Areopagitica, the great innovation of the Roman Church was preven- tive censorship, which it invented in an effort to stop the spread of reform. This form of control took definitive shape in the mid-sixteenth century when Leo X passed his ordinance forbidding the printing of texts not previously licensed or approved, and when the first Indexes of pro- hibited books were published." Prior to that point, writes Milton in a passage of somewhat disquieting rhetoric, Books were ever as freely admitted into the World as any other birth; the issue of the brain was no more stifl'd then the issue of the womb: no envious Juno sate cros-leg'd over the nativity of any mans intellectuall off-spring; but if it prov'd a Monster, who denies, but that it was justly burnt, or sunk into the Sea. But that a Book in wors con- dition then a peccant soul, should be to stand before a Jury ere it be borne to the World, and undergo yet in darknesse the judgement of Radamanth and his Collegues, ere it can passe the ferry backward into light, was never heard before, till that mysterious iniquity pro- vokt and troubl'd at the first entrance of the Reformation, sought out new limbo's and new hells wherein they might include our Books also within the number of their damned.12 Milton's anthropomorphism of the book may have been intended to affirm the independence of the written work - books, he argues, take on a life of their own and circulate unsupervised by the men who produced them - but at the same time it evokes the somber consequences of con- flating an author with his published corpus in a world where autos-da-f6 targeted both types of bodies. One is reminded of Foucault's effort to demystify the cult of the author in western society: "texts, books, and dis- courses," he wrote, "really began to have authors (other than mythical, "sacralized" and "sacralizing" figures) to the extent that authors became 117</page><page sequence="6">subject to punishment, that is, to the extent that discourses could be transgressive."13 Milton, of course, stood to gain much in his plea for (a qualified) freedom of the press in England by linking preventive censorship, his pri- mary target in the Areopagitica, with the Roman Church and with the early suppression of Protestant texts. Insofar as France is concerned, how- ever, Milton's chronology misses the mark. According to French records, the preventive censor was inaugurated in the 1440s, a century prior to the publication of the first Indexes of prohibited books, and slightly prior even to the importation of Gutenberg's printing press into France - a fact worth noting given the causal relation frequently asserted between the rise of printing in Europe and the advent of preventive censorship. The move was initiated, moreover, by the Parlement of Paris rather than the Church, with the goal not of eradicating heretical texts but of regu- lating the comic stage, which at this particular point was flourishing for the first time since antiquity.'4 It is not necessary, nor would it be possible, to outline here in any detail the history of the rebirth of early comic theater in France. Two basic facts, however, can be noted: first, that a trio of early comic spectacle gen- res - the farce, the sottie, and the moralitd - predate the reintroduction of classical drama into France by a century or so (depending on when you choose to start and stop the clock); and second, that the emergence of the comic theater via these genres is identified with the law clerks of the Basoche. In other words, this confluence of developments in the fifteenth century gave rise to an intriguing and typically Legendrian triangle of rela- tionships: out of the union, this vaguely incestuous and relatively short-lived union of law and theater, was born - or reborn - the censor.5 II. Rebirth of Comedy The Basoche, whose spectacles served as the catalyst for the emer- gence of this new, preventive censor, was a transitional organization, designed to ease the law clerks's entrance into legal practice and to pro- vide an interim set of social affiliations for young men positioned between the successive power structures of the family and the profession. In the French fifteenth century, the transition into practice involved an abrupt shift from academic legal training, which centered on canon or civil law 118</page><page sequence="7">(or both), into a courtroom where the principles and procedures derived instead from local customary law.16 Not only were the clerks faced with a different legal tradition when entering practice, but also their very approach to reasoning and arguing had to change: they had to leave behind the close readings, the exercises in textual interpretation, and the potentially endless disputation of the scholastic classroom, in order to develop the rhetorical skills and pragmatic argument techniques suitable for the everyday resolution of disputes in the courtroom."7 Transition from theory to practice was effected in part through par- ticipation in a range of theatricalized activities. The most basic of these was the law clerks's regular parade which, much like a royal entrie, func- tioned as a public display of the association's power. In a second vein, more closely connected to legal practice and rooted in a different form of representation, were the moot court cases which the Basochiens per- formed on a regular basis. Third, often in conjunction with public holidays, the clerks staged what can be best described as moot court's car- nivalesque counterpart, the cause grasse, a type of mock trial in which all the weight of standard courtroom procedure and jurisprudence was brought to bear upon a frivolous and often risque complaint.'8 And final- ly - like their English counterparts in the Inns of Court in this respect - the Basoche clerks performed in more or less purely theatrical specta- cles: namely, they produced and acted in the genres already mentioned as constituting the first wave of comic theater in France." Ironically, much of what we know about the involvement of the law clerks in early comic theater comes to us via the censor, that is, via traces of the repression and control which the clerks's superiors at Parlement directed at Basoche productions. In 1476, for instance, Parlement pro- mulgated the following ordinance censoring the plays of the law clerks who served as apprentices at the most important civil and criminal courts in the country: The Court, moved by certain reasons, has prohibited and prohibits from this time forward all Clerks and Servants, whether of the Palais or of the Chatelet of Paris, whatso- ever status they might have, from performing in public at either the aforementioned Palais or Chatelet or elsewhere in public places, Farces, Sotties, Moralities or other Plays 119</page><page sequence="8">where people are convened, under threat of banishment from this Kingdom &amp; confiscation of all their goods: &amp; let them not ask leave of this Court, nor another, to per- form, under threat of forever being deprived access to the aforesaid Palais or Ch.telet.20 The lawyers of Parlement evidently felt it necessary to try to control the representations of their young understudies, but what was it exactly about the law clerks's spectacles that was deemed so dangerous? There are a number of ways of thinking about this question. Most lit- erary historians, to the extent that they have bothered to broach the issue at all, tend to assume that it was the political content of the Basoche plays that drew the attention of the censor - namely, criticisms directed against the king and his policies, or attacks on leading figures in Parle- ment.21 Some of the documentary evidence supports this, and moreover it fits as well with our general sense (especially in modern constitutional reasoning) that political speech is the natural primary target of state cen- sorship. However, if it was the political content of the Basoche plays that caught the watchful eye of the censor, Parlement's new surveillance system must have been remarkably successful: very few of the extant farces devel- op explicitly political themes or are overtly critical of the monarchy or its administration.22 Instead, most scenarios deal with local disputes: with browbeaten husbands, foolish sons, lascivious wives, and with the verbal subterfuges the characters mercilessly exploit and fall prey to in turn. On the other hand, if Parlement wanted to control the sexual content of the plays - obscenity being, after all, the other traditional target for state censorship - it did a very poor job: a great many of the early farces that have come down to us revolve more or less exclusively around sexual puns and the performance of metaphorically sexual activities. My own suspicion is that it was not so much the political or sexual content of Basoche drama which provoked the wrath of the clerks's supe- riors at Parlement and set the censorial machine in motion, but rather the clerks's incursion into unauthorized realms of representation. Detractors of the stage have, of course, always held the theater to be morally suspect, tainted through association with other forms of deception and dissimula- tion. As Rousseau asked in his Lettre s d'Alembert sur les spectacles: what is to stop the actor who has perfected the subtle art of illusion, innocent 120</page><page sequence="9">enough in the controlled environment of the stage, from exploiting his expertise to nefarious effect in the real world?23 It was this fear of conta- gion among representational forms which must have compelled Parlement to rein in Basoche drama - a fear, more precisely, that the clerks's flair for theatrical representation would spread into and infect their "legitimate" role as representers of clients and claims. This was all the more urgent a concern given the usual framework for Basoche drama: the law clerks's plays were performed in the grand'salle of the Palais in Paris, that is, in the same hall in which regular court cases were heard.24 The curtain having descended on the solemn business of law at the end of the day's sitting, it rose again in the off hours to display the farce's car- nivalesque inversion of the legal realm: a world not of sense but of nonsense, populated not by reasonable persons but by fools, concerned not with honorable representation but with fraudulent misrepresentation, ruse, and deceit.25 However, if we understand Legendre's conception of the censorial function as necessarily linked to the law's need to patrol the domain of the image generally, it may not matter what was said or done on the Basoche stage at all.26 That is to say, perhaps Parlement's opposition to Basoche theater should be seen as censorship for its own sake, a way of teaching the clerks to come to terms with the force of the law by obliging them to submit to its order.27 This would help explain the cyclical pattern of cen- sorship in the Basoche context: Basoche clerks taunted their superiors at Parlement and evaded their watchful eye by every means of verbal and spectacular subtlety available, until they themselves became the institu- tion and censored the next generation of clerks. In other words, the clerks resisted the censor in order to take its place. III. Farce of the Digests Having begun with Gombrowicz's image of the censorial function and of the ability of the law (incarnated in the lawyer Kraykowski) to entice the subject toward it, I want to turn now to another fiction with the aim of anchoring Legendre's insights within the context of Basoche drama. The Basoche clerks's ambivalent attitude toward the censor and toward the law itself provided the impetus for one of the most obscure farces to come down to us, the Farce of the Digests. Whereas the majority 121</page><page sequence="10">of extant farce scenarios are connected to the legal institution in indirect ways - through, for example, the counter-legal celebration of the irra- tional, or the hyper-exploitation of indeterminate language as a means of destabilizing an overly simplified juridical faith in truth and sense - the Farce of the Digests takes us to the heart of the law as it was practiced in the fifteenth century and as it was experienced by the clerks of the Basoche.28 Its full title sums up the main action of the play - at least, to the extent that there is an action - and introduces the characters as well: The Farce of Old Digest and New Digest in which Two Students Study, Who Cannot Find the Means to Make Money If Not by Custom and Law.29 Of the play's five-person dramatis personae, two characters are law clerks, named simply Primus and Secundus in the text, and two represent divisions of Justinian's Digest as it was traditionally but somewhat arbi- trarily arranged in the medieval period.30 The fifth, Custom, represents an oral legal tradition which at the time of its materialization as a character on the Basoche stage was being transcribed systematically for the first time.3' How anyone would manage to stage this - let alone why - is something of a mystery. To make matters worse, just as in mid-twentieth- century theater of the absurd (which is, in many respects, the heir of the early French comic tradition), nothing really happens in the play. The only identifiable action in the Farce ofthe Digests is the clerks's shift in loy- alties from their aristocratic lovers, Old and New Digest, to this resourceful but unrefined upstart Custom. What the scenario presents is a struggle for the hearts of the clerks waged between the complex and sophisticated but insolvent texts of the Roman law, on the one side, and the pragmatic, frank, and efficient body of custom law on the other. While Custom is derided as a sort of factotum in the play, it is towards her and away from the Digests that the clerks eventually turn in the hope of finally turning a profit in law. In keeping with the medieval legal dic- tum, custom conquers law (consuetudo vincit legem).32 What is most engaging about the Farce of the Digests, at least for the present purpose, is the way in which it exploits the farce genre's standard comic techniques in order to explore its unusual themes. One of the most prevalent of these techniques was the metaphor misunderstood or dra- matized, and it is this which produces the fantasy of the living law books in the Farce of the Digests. In fact, there are two routes through idiomatic expressions to the incarnation of the books. In the first, the books come 122</page><page sequence="11">alive via the misapprehension, at once naive and astute, of the scholastic legal doctrine of lex or justitia animata, by which the emperor, king, or occasionally the judge was recognized as the law incarnate, the living embodiment of the power enshrined in the text of the law.33 In the fan- tasy realm of the Farce of the Digests, the clerks possess the text of the law not merely through the vehicle of their father-figures at Parlement, or in the shadow of the king, but directly. They have, so to speak, taken hold of the dogmatic function and embraced the censor. In the second trope, the "corpus" of Justinian's Corpus luris Civilis is understood literally as a "body" of law, a physical body, capable of enticing the clerks Primus and Secundus with the promise of an oddly literalized version of what Roland Barthes called the plaisir du texte, the pleasure of the text. Secundus, for example, repeats Je prens plaisance sur mon livre, and extols the physical attributes of New Digest in overtly sexual terms: Pour avoir desduit Etpasser la nuyt Gorgiasement, Rire i I'appetit, Le teton petit, C'est vous proprement. 34 ["To enjoy oneself and pass the night gorgeously, laugh one's fill, petite breasts, you're definitely the one."] This second misreading, while less erudite than the play with the doc- trine of lex animata, holds our attention with the very perversity of its attachment to the literal register. The clerks Primus and Secundus, it appears, are caught in a linguistic double bind. The closer they come to correcting their mistaken interpretation of the corpora involved - that is, the more the books are described as bound, illuminated, material books rather than as bodies - the more carnal the books become. New Digest, for instance, sings her own praises as follows: Vous n'avez trouve que saveur En moy etjoyeulx esperitz, Noz chappitres tous bien escriptz, Mon texte bien enlumine, Leparchemin blanc que lid, 123</page><page sequence="12">Par hault, par bas, fort bien reigld Et mon bas assez bien stilli, Et tousjours ung gentil engin. Posd qu'il ne soit refuse, Si se rusera-il i la fin, Ma glose d'ungjoyeulx latin Bien parapher et bien escripre.35 ["You've found nothing but pleasure in me and merry spirits: our chapters are all finely written, my text skill- fully illuminated, my parchment white as stone, carefully ruled on top and bottom, and my margin [or bottom] well styled [or much practiced]; and always a gallant mind [or tool], supposing he isn't rejected, will figure out in the end how to write and paraph my gloss in a merry Latin."] This is as close as any of the characters comes to treating the Digests as actual books, down to describing the very paraph marks which set off the different sections of the manuscript. And yet the gentil engin with its well established equivocal sense in contemporary idiom, the bas assez bien stilld, these phrases let slip through a second, ribald reading. The empha- sis on writing and parchment likewise adverts to a less than innocent figurative meaning: what could be more vital to the materiality of the book than parchment and ink? And yet the phrase ecrire sur parchement, through the equivalence of parchment with hide or skin, appears in a number of fifteenth-century sources as a metaphor for the sexual act.36 Like Legendre's own work, the Farce ofthe Digests can be seen to func- tion on several levels simultaneously. On one plane, the farce portrays a specific moment in the life of the Basoche clerk in a particular historical juncture for the profession: the moment of transition from scholarship (dominated, as Legendre suggests, by the amorous relation of the subject and his text37) to practice, and from Roman law to custom. But on a dif- ferent level, the Farce of the Digests presents us with a rite of passage from which no one escapes: the second mirror stage of the subject, moment of fascination with and by the law. In this sense, the Basoche clerks appear to have had the same insight as Legendre into what he calls "the non- juridical scene of law, the Theatre of Justice and Truth [...], where 124</page><page sequence="13">symbolic representations are ritually produced by means of which we, simple subjects, are identified and identifiable in a culture."38 In fact, although Legendre never mentions the early comic stage in his work, the themes running through the Farce of the Digests - the passion of study, the draw of the text, the relation of law to desire, and the incarnation of power in the body of authority - are so familiar from Legendre's work that there is something vaguely uncanny about seeing them fleshed out, as it were, on the Basoche stage. What better pathway into the play's per- plexing imagery, for instance, than Legendre's commentary on Roman-style juridicism's grip on the subject: [T]he truth of the text lies not in its letter, the truth is a matter of power, the power which rests in a certain real body defined as the ceremonial body of the incarnate law. This enigma is central, a turning point in the entire sys- tem. It is a question of the mechanism of the principle of authority and of the imaginary placement of subjects. How does one cleave to a text, how does adhesion to the truth of the text occur, and by what subtle artifice can one amorously enjoy a text?39 Legendre's apparently rhetorical questions receive an unexpected response on the Basoche stage. One cleaves to the text metaphorically, by means of a slippage between the various senses of the word "corpus" espe- cially in relation to the sources of Roman law. One adheres to its truth by repeating it, intertextually in this case through a reproduction of Richard de Bury's Philobiblon, a work which introduced an earlier generation of readers to the scholar's affective attachment to beautiful but fickle Books.40 One enjoys the text epigrammatically, evoking in puns and allu- sions an analogy between writing and the sexual act, through the imagery of contact between quills and parchment or skin. By its repetition of piv- otal metaphors and themes, the Farce of the Digests confirms Legendre's understanding of the historical formation of the western psyche and its dogmatic-theatric turn during the eleventh century revolution of the interpreter. 125</page><page sequence="14">IV Bodies Inscribed by Law Just as books have a habit of coming alive ("for Bookes," as Milton says, "are not absolutely dead things"41) and of inspiring love in the read- ing subject, so too is the subject in turn inscribed in and by the text of the law. In other words, the concept of the law's incarnation in figures of power, central to the legal imagination from the rebirth of Roman law onward, is matched by what Michel de Certeau called the "intextuation of the body."42 As Kafka captured all too vividly in his Penal Colony where by way of punishment the convicted passed through a modified printing press which cut into his skin the text of the provision transgressed, as Foucault demonstrated throughout his work on the interaction of pun- ishment, sexuality and subjectivity, and as Lacan formulated in more explicitly psychoanalytical terms with his reflections on the Nom-du- P re, the task of the law is to imprint itself on the individual, to mark the subject's very body with the sign of its normative power. Certeau, align- ing himself with this general strain of critical thinking about the law's techniques and effects, and on this occasion drawing explicitly upon Legendre's Amour du censeur, isolates what may be a darker undertone in the play of writing and parchment in the Farce of the Digests: From the moment of birth to the mourning of death, the law "seizes" bodies in order to fashion its text out of them. By means of every sort of initiation (in rituals, at school, etc.) it transforms bodies into the tables of the law, into living tablets of rules and customs, into theatre actors organised by a social order. ... [T]he law writes itself on bodies. It engraves itself on a parchment made of the skin of its subjects. It articulates them into a juridical corpus. It makes a book of them. These writings carry out two complementary operations: by them, living beings are "inscribed" [mis en texte], and, at the same time, reason or the Logos of a society is "made flesh" (an incarnation).43 Correspondingly, it is difficult to say in reading the Farce ofthe Digests if it is the law books that are brought to life, like Pygmalion's statue, by the delirious passion of Primus and Secundus, or if it is not instead the law clerks who are metamorphosing into parchment and ink, both on 126</page><page sequence="15">stage and off. The clerks's desire for the text of the law, their amour du censeur, can be understood either way. The ambivalence of the Farce of the Digests, and of the Basoche farce more generally, lies in the difficulty we have in gauging whether the clerks's theatrical productions were in fact the affront to the law and to the legal institution that Parlement seems to have feared, or whether their spectacles were not rather part of this process of the clerks's incorporation into the text of the law. As Freud pointed out, the effect of recognizing the censor is the application of self-censorship in anticipation of official rejection: "The author has seen in advance which passages might expect to give rise to objections from the censorship and has on that account toned them down in advance, modified them slightly, or has contented himself with approximations and allusions to what would genuinely have come from his pen.""44 One way of interpreting the law clerks's relatively brief foray into the theater at this particular juncture, just as the legal institution in France was consolidating and professionalizing itself, is as an attempt to divert into the farce ways of thinking, reading and acting that threatened to interfere with the smooth functioning of the judicial system and with their own burgeoning professional lives.45 Like the car- nival tradition of which it was very much a part, it seems that the farce may have finished by shoring up the institution of the law in the very attempt to invert it insofar as it created a mirror realm of representation that could encompass all the law wished to repress, including interpretive ambivalence, resuscitated metaphors, nonsense, folly, and chaos. With the successful creation of an autonomous legal institution in the mid-six- teenth century came the dissolution of the farce genre, the gradual decline of the Basoche, and the development of professionalized theater which no longer served - at least not with the same immediacy - as the collect- ing grounds for the law's disjecta membra. * Many thanks to Peter Goodrich - Oedipus Lex animata! - and to Phiroze Vasunia for reading versions of this paper, and to the organizers and participants at the Cardozo symposium on Theaters of Justice and Fictions of Law for their interest. 127</page><page sequence="16">1 Pierre Legendre, Paroles poetiques ichappees du texte: leFons sur la communication indus- trielle (Paris: Seuil, 1982) 46; see text accompanying infra note 39. 2 See Jacques Lacan, "Fonction et champ de la parole et du langage en psychanalyse," F crits I (Paris: Seuil, 1966), p. 150. 3 Cf., Sigmund Freud, The Interpretation ofDreams SE 5:525. 4 See Peter Goodrich, Law in the Courts ofLove: Literature and Other Minor Jurisprudences (New York: Routledge, 1996). 5 Witold Gombrowicz, "Le danseur de Maitre Kraykowski," Bakakai; Georges Sedir, Allan Kosko, &amp; Brone, trans.

It is worth not- ing, in the context of this paper, that according to Tertullian in book 10 of his De spectaculis, the theatre ranked among the targets of censorial opprobrium: see Tertullian, Apology and De Spectaculis, T.R. Glover, trans. and ed. (London: Heinemann, 1931). 8 An Introduction to Roman Law, 3rd ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1962) 4-5. 9 This is, of course, precisely how Freud did not want his readers to imagine the censor: see Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis SE 15:140 ("I hope you do not take the term too anthropomorphically, and do not picture the 'censor of dreams' as a severe little manikin or a spirit living in a closet of the brain and there discharging his office"). 10 Ibid. at 15:138-139. Freud first addressed the notion of a censorial mechanism for the unconscious in a letter to Wilhelm Fliess dated December 22, 1897: "Have you ever seen a foreign newspaper which passed Russian censorship at the frontier? Words, whole clauses and sentences are blacked out so that the rest becomes unintelligible. A Russian censorship of that kind comes about in psychoses and produces the apparently mean- ingless deliria." See Jeffrey Masson, trans. and ed., The Complete Letters ofSigmund Freud to Wilhelm Fliess, 1887-1904 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985), p. 289. See also The Interpretation of Dreams SE 4:142-145, where Freud sets out the triangular metaphor of unconscious as author, resistance as censor, and conscious as spectator or reader most explicitly; cf also, however, Jacques Lacan, "La censure n'est pas la resis- 128</page><page sequence="17">tance," Le seminaire dej acques Lacan: II. Le Moi dans la theorie de Freud et dans la tech- nique de la psychanalyse, 1954-1955 (Paris: Seuil, 1978). Cf also E.T.A. Hoffman's novel The Devil's Elixir (1813-1816), in which one character describes consciousness as "noth- ing but the confounded activity of a damned toll-collector - excise-man - deputy-chief customs officer, who has set up his infamous bureau in our top storey and who exclaims, whenever any goods try to get out: 'Hi! hi! exports are prohibited ... they must stay here ... here, in this country..."': see the note provided by the editor to Freud's essay on "The Uncanny" in Sigmund Freud, Art and Literature: Jensen's Gradiva, Leonardo da Vinci, and Other Works, Albert Dickson, ed.

See also 4:297-298, where censorship and inquisition are again ambiguously linked through the personification of books, and in which Milton supports the repressive censorship of some corpora ("I deny not, but that it is of greatest concernment in the Church and Commonwealth, to have a vigilant eye how Bookes demeane themselves as well as men; and thereafter to confine, imprison, and do sharpest justice on them as malefactors") before continuing in the vein that most readers of the Areopagitica prefer to cite ("We should be wary therefore what persecution we raise against the living labours of publick men, how we spill that season'd life of Man preserv'd and stor'd up in Bookes; since we see a kinde of homicide may be thus committed, some- times even a martyrdome, and if it extend to the whole impression, a kinde of massacre, whereof the execution ends not in the slaying of an elementall life, but strikes at that etheriall and fift essence, the breath of reason it selfe and slaies an immortality rather than a life").

Frangois Hotman vehemently objected to this academic emphasis on Roman law, which continued into the late sixteenth century: seeAntiTribonian ou Discours d'un grand et renomme' Jurisconsulte de nostre temps sur l'estude des loix (Paris: chez Jeremie Perier, 1603) 36. 17 The shift carried out by the individual Basochians as part of their professional develop- ment mirrored the era's general turn from scholasticism to humanism, with all the gains and losses which that change entailed: see Donald Kelley, Foundations of Modern Historical Scholarship: Language, Law, and History in the French Renaissance (New York: Columbia University Press: 1970) and History, Law and the Human Sciences (London: Variorum, 1984); see also Anthony Grafton &amp; Lisa Jardine, From Humanism to the Humanities: Education and the Liberal Arts in Fifteenth and Sixteenth-Century Europe (London: Duckworth: 1986). 18 See M.J. Freeman's introduction to his edition of Guillaume Coquillart, Oeuvres (Geneva: Droz, 1974), xxxv. 19 It should be noted that two theatrical movements preceded the rise of the farce and the widespread development of theater in France: the Latin theatre of the twelfth century, and the Arras plays written in the vernacular and dating from the thirteenth century. 20 See Frangois &amp; Claude Parfaict, Histoire du thi~tre franfois depuis son origine jusqu't pre'sent, 10 vols. (Paris: 1745), 1:102. 21 To see how far personal attacks could go in the same period, one has only to contrast with the extant farces the direct targeting of major figures in the Paris financial, governmen- tal and legal circles in the satirical testaments attributed to Frangois Villon. 22 See, however, Champion's account of the post-representation punishment of Henri Baude for obliquely criticizing the king in his moralite played at the Palais by law clerks in 1486: Pierre Champion, Histoire poetique du quinzi'me sik'cle, 2 vols. (Paris: Champion, 1923), 2.254-256. For surviving examples of political-religious critique dat- ing from the end of the farce era, see Jonathan Beck, ed., Thidtre etpropagande aux dibuts de la Reforme: six pikces polkmiques du Recueil La Valliire (Geneva: Slatkine, 1986). 23 See Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Oeuvres complites: V Ecrits sur la musique, la langue et le thi&amp;tre, Bernard Gagnebin &amp; Marcel Raymond, eds. (Paris: Gallimard, 1995), p. 73: "These artful valets, so subtle of hand and of tongue on stage, to meet the needs of a trade more exorbitant than lucrative will they never put their diversions to use? Will they 130</page><page sequence="19">never take the purse of a prodigal son or an avaricious father for that of Leandre or Argan? Everywhere the temptation to do ill augments with its facility; and Actors must necessarily be more virtuous than other men, if they are not more corrupt." 24 See Fabre, Les Clercs du Palais: recherches historiques, supra note 14 at 144, and M. Audin, La Bazoche, &amp;e les clercs du palais (Lyon: Petrus Decleris, 1909), p. 9. It is clear from the ordinance of 1476 (see text accompanying supra note 20) that the Basoche clerks staged performances at Chatelet, the main criminal court and prison in Paris, and "en lieux publics" as well. 25 Cf. Freud's comments on the university student's rebellion from reason in Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious SE 8:125-126. 26 The theatricality of law and its control of images is a theme which runs throughout Legendre's work; see in particular Legendre, Dieu au miroir: itude sur l'institution des images (Paris: Fayard, 1994). 27 Parlement's opposition to the theater subsisted even in the face of monarchical support for the spectacles in later periods: see Hallays-Dabot, supra note 14 at 14. It is worth not- ing that the end of religious theater was brought on in 1548 not by the Church, the Sorbonne, or the king, but by Parliamentary ordinance. 28 The much more widely known and justly celebrated Farce de Maitre Pierre Pathelin pro- vides another example of how the manifest and latent legal content of the farce can overlap. 29 Farce nouvelle de Digeste Vieille et Digeste Neufve ou deux Escoliers estudient, lesquelz nepeu- vent trouver moyen d'avoir argent, si n'est par Coustume et Loix. The only text of the play currently available is contained in Gustave Cohen's hasty transcription of the now miss- ing Florence collection of farces; see Cohen, ed., Recueil defarces franfaises inedites du XVe sikcle (Cambridge, Mass.: Mediaeval Academy of America, 1949). 30 Until Renaissance jurists put an end to the practice in the sixteenth century, the Digest was generally divided as follows: Digestum Vetus (D 1.1 to D 24.2), Infortiatum (D 24.3 to D 38.17), Digestum Novum (D 39.1 to the end). Francesco Calasso summarizes some of the explanations that have been given for the medieval reorganization of the Corpus Iuris Civilis in his Medio evo del diritto (Milan: Guiffre, 1954), pp. 526-527. 31 Charles VII's ordinance from Montils-lez-Tours dated 1454 sets the transcription process in motion; see Rend Filhol, "La redaction des coutumes en France aux XVe et XVIe si&amp;- cles," in John Gilissen, ed., La redaction des coutumes dans le passe' et dans le present (Brussels: Editions de l'Institut de Sociologie, 1962), p. 65. That the process was not completed immediately is evident from Louis XII's ordinance from Blois dated from January 21, 1510, reaffirming the transcription project undertaken by his predecessors Charles VII, Louis XI, and Charles VIII, as reproduced in the Coustumes de la prevoste et vicomte de Paris, avec les notes de M. C[harles] du Molin, restituees en leur entier (Paris: chez Pierre Lamy, 1660), pp. 982-983. 32 On the relation between custom and law in the European tradition, see Donald Kelley, "'Second Nature': The Idea of Custom in European Law, Society and Culture," in Anthony Grafton &amp; Ann Blair, eds., The Transmission of Culture in Early Modern Europe (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990), pp. 131-172; see also Andre Gouron, "Coutume contre loi chez les premiers glossateurs," in Andre Gouron &amp; Albert 131</page><page sequence="20">Rigaudiere, eds., Renaissance du pouvoir legislatif et genese de l'Ptat (Montpellier: Etat Socapress, 1988), pp. 117-130. 33 French jurists drew upon the conception of imperial authority formulated by early Italian legists for the benefit of the German emperors: "You, being the living Law, can give, loosen and proclaim laws; dukes stand and fall, and kings rule while you are the judge; anything you wish, you carry on as the animate Law" [ Tu lex viva potes dare, solvere, con- dere, leges, Stantque caduntque duces, regnant te iudice reges; Rem, quocumque velis, lex animata geris] - a model which in turn borrowed from Justinian's well-known maxim in the Novels describing the emperor as the living law; see Ernst Kantorowicz, The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Medieval Political Theology (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1957), p. 129. Laurent Mayali has expanded upon the maxim's historical context: see Mayali, "Lex animata: Rationalisation du pouvoir politique et science juridique (XII- XIV~me si&amp;cles)," in Renaissance du pouvoir IMgislatif, supra note 32 at 155-164. The doctrine has taken on new theoretical life in the work of Pierre Legendre and Peter Goodrich. 34 See supra note 29 at lines 294-299. 35 Id., at lines 110-121. The syntax and grammar of line 114 as transcribed in Cohen's text are puzzling. 36 The equivocal meaning of parchemin in the early comic-legal lexicon is attested in Coquillart: see supra note 18 at 109, 328. It is spelled out more fully by Granger in the first scene of Cyrano de Bergerac's Le pedantjoue'; see Cyrano de Bergerac, Oeuvres, ed. Jacques Prevot (Paris: Librarie Belin, 1977), p. 170: "It is this, perhaps, which entices you to press your carnal pen against my daughter's virgin parchment" (C'estpeut-estre ce qui vous donne envie d'appuyer vostre plume charnelle sur leparchemin vierge de ma fille). Not surprisingly, Freud also saw writing as an act potentially imbued with sexual significance, and he linked inhibitions concerning writing with repression; see, e.g., his 1926 text "Inhibition, Symptom and Anxiety," SE 20:90: "As soon as writing, which entails mak- ing liquid flow out of a tube on to a piece of white paper, assumes the significance of copulation, or as soon as walking becomes a symbolic substitute for treading upon the body of mother earth, both writing and walking are stopped because they represent the performance of a forbidden sexual act." 37 See Pierre Legendre, "Protocol of the Love Letter," in Law and the Unconscious, supra note 6 at 87: "In the context of scholarship, the amorous relation of a subject to his text nec- essarily represents itself in a theatrical form.... One cannot be a scholar unless one is in love, gripped by a passion, by an all-consuming passion." 38 Pierre Legendre, Le crime du caporal Lortie: traite sur le p're (Paris: Fayard, 1989), p. 69. 39 See supra note 1. 40 Richard de Bury, The Philobiblon, ed.
