I really don't consider myself an artist. I make art, but it's a job ... this is one profession in which I can be a little bit stupid, and people will say, 'Oh you are so stupid, thank you, thank you for being so stupid (Maurizio Cattelan') To the cynical observer, it may seem something of a no-brainer to suggest, as Jean-Yves Jouannais does in L'idiotie, that idiocy is a fundamental and essential characteristic of much late twentieth-century art. Certainly the studied, practised cynicism of a character like Maurizio Cattelan (quoted above) does little to deter the cynical response inevitably returned to the work he produces by the pre-programmed, deep structural cyni- cism of late twentieth-century art criticism.2 It is, how- ever, a more complex proposition to describe idiocy, stupidity and a host of sub-divisions of these terms as somehow knitting together art, life and politics into a method: the intent signposted by the full title of Jouannais's book. Without a doubt, however, this appar- ently whimsical book warrants a careful and considered reading (and further, I would argue, demands an English language edition). I make no apology for the delay in reviewing L'idiotie some years after its publication. The principal reason being that it has been difficult to find a critical context against which to measure its success and critical pur- chase, although as time has passed its central theme has become increasingly relevant. Suitable comparative publications would have to have been monographs on the various contemporary artists mentioned by Jouannais, or alternatives selected for perceived idiocies of their own: Cattelan, Mike Kelley, Martin Kippenberger or Erwin Wurm perhaps (although there are a host of others). It is a notable feature of Jouannais's book, however, that for the most part he eschews the obvious candidates, whose work, in any case, on closer inspec- tion, would probably turn out to be far too sophisticated and calculated to qualify them as genuine 'idiots'. Instead, Jouannais traces perverse thematic trajectories, from the late nineteenth century to the present, that lead, literally in some cases, right up the garden path. There have undoubtedly been some important contributions to the debates opened up in L'idiotie through publications on single contemporary artists (an excellent short essay by Ralph Rugoff in Erwin Wurm: I Love My Time, I Don't Like My Time, for example) but what sets L'idiotie apart is its concerted attempt to deal with notions of heritage, legacy or, even more worrying, progress, in stupid artistic strategies and idiotic avant-garde gambits.3 David Hopkins's short catalogue Dada's Boys: Identity and Play in Contemporary Art, produced to accompany an exhibition at the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh, but also, importantly, presaging a much longer work by the author soon to be published by Yale University Press dealing with similar material, provides an ideal point of reference for Jouannais's work: as, indeed, for comple- tely different reasons, does the recent catalogue Magritte and Contemporary Art: The Treachery of Images. In each case, convincing arguments are put for- ward linking avant-gardist strategies (those of Duchamp, Picabia, Man Ray and then Magritte) to contemporary artistic practices, by invoking the disruptive potential of humour, play, inanity and apparently empty gestures. Hopkins is obviously on familiar territory with Duchamp, Picabia and Man Ray, having published in recent years, both in the Oxford Art Journal and elsewhere, some of the most convincing and theoretically astute readings of the stake involved in the subtle effectiveness of Dadaist subversions.4 Here, as before, masculinity is the spanner that Hopkins tosses into the Dada machine, drawing analogies and allusions to works produced from the 1980s onwards, which are grouped as follows: Jeff Koons; Richard Prince and Martin Kippenberger; Angus Fairhurst, Damien Hirst and Sarah Lucas; Douglas Gordon, Roderick Buchanan and Keith Farquhar; Paul McCarthy, Knut Asdam and John Bock; Matthew Barney. In this stylish, sophisticated and characteristically good- humoured book, Hopkins accomplishes something both valuable and unusual in placing so-called 'YBAs' into a challenging critical context: there is, after all, an inherent risk in subjecting recent work to the weight of association with Duchamp. The flip side of this risk (not living up to the cast shadow of the pater familias of conceptual art) is the taint of association with an artist like Magritte, who has, through a kind of influential aversion therapy, some- how come to symbolise both bad surrealism and bad painting: this despite the fact that his 'enlightened rep- etition' formula for commercial success continues to be exploited by contemporary artists. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art exhibition and catalogue address this issue head on, offering a much-needed critical ( The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press; all rights reserved.

Fashionable (and respectable) artists like Ed Ruscha 'admit' their respect for Magritte and serious theorists like Thierry de Duve explore the complex semiotic chal- lenges laid down by Magritte through their uptake by later (and somehow more 'serious') artists like Marcel Broodthaers. There are also essays linking Magritte to figures as diverse as Richard Artschwager, John Baldessari (who also designed LACMA's exhibition), Vija Celmins, Robert Gober, Jasper Johns and Jeff Koons. Together with scholarly historical accounts of Magritte's reception in America, and the influence of his dealers and collectors there, the book adds up to far more than the sum promised by its parts. The final essay, however, is particular significant, deal- ing, as it does, with the legacy of what has come to be known as Magritte's 'p6riode vache'.5 Literally his 'cow period', this is the name given to several months of intense activity culminating in a 'disastrous' (i.e. criti- cally panned) Paris exhibition in 1948. Ditching his reliable and highly profitable trademark iconography and style, Magritte struck out in a deliriously unselfcon- scious new direction: bright chequered skies, multico- loured bunny rabbits, cannibal anthropomorphism, ham baking in dazzling sunlight and irradiated onions. The technique changed too, gone were the smooth, calcu- lated lines and opaque forms, in came hurried-looking, scrawled brushstrokes, dabs of white (and blue) high- lights, imprecise abstractions and cartoon forms; all in lurid, clashing palettes. In kamikaze fashion Magritte also turned on his own iconography: pipes pierce body parts and bowler hats stare with cyclopean eyes. In some cases, especially the gouaches, Magritte seems to have totally unhinged and liberated himself. Works like Titania, L'Art de vivre and Pom'po pom'po pom po pom pon are unexpectedly joyous and totally hilarious: not adjectives usually associated with Magritte. Happily (because there is relatively little historical detail about the period vache in Magritte and Contemporary Art) this unique and incredible phase of Magritte's career was described and documented in depth in a 1992 exhibition and catalogue Ren6 Magritte - La Periode Vache (Musee Cantini, Marseille).6 However, it is how this awkward phase fits into (or falls out of) Magritte's career and reputation that makes it so compelling in relation to contemporary practice. It could be argued that there are two possibilities contained within Magritte and Contemporary Art: there is the con- ventional Magritte, re-evaluated so that many different facets of his best-known work have relevance and perti- nence to post-war practice; and there is the unstable, desperate, failed Magritte of the p6riod vache that, it could be argued, is actually far more relevant today, as seductive links made with Kippenberger and Richard Prince confirm. An even more glaring affinity, with the work of George Condo, seems a puzzling omission. There is, however, an alternative possibility, one that lies outside the structure and remit of a project that sets out to find such relationships, and leads instead back to Jouannais's idiocy. The p6riod vache is one of a series of touchstone his- torical events and gambits that form the basis of L'idiotie. Beginning with the quotable Tristan Tzara 'an idiot, like all of you', Jouannais argues for the existence of a determined dumb streak at the core of modern art.7 In an introduction likely to send chills down the spine of anyone regularly tasked with clarifying modernism and modernity to students, Jouannais claims that like 'the art of the twentieth century' and 'stupidity', the terms 'modern' and 'idiot' are synonymous: 'art did not become modern' he suggests, 'until idiocy became its generative principle' (p. 12). On the face of it there is ample evidence to support such a claim, as predictable references to the Incoherents, Dada and Surrealism suggest. The fact that the latter archetypes of enlightened stupidity also serve as the models for Peter Burger's Theory of the Avant-Garde is, it might also be argued, proof that Joannais at least is no idiot.8 However, simply identifying a new term (replacing avant-garde with idiotic) is not Jouannais's intention: instead he proposes that idiocy be seen as a tactical (albeit often inadvertent) response to the logic of originality and progress inherent in the con- cept of the avant-garde; evoking Raymond Hains's description of art's 'vast heraldry of derision' (p. 13.). Neither is Jouannais content to deal with simple-minded absurdism or deliberate failure in the process of artistic production and reception (bad art for bad people). Instead he points to what he calls 'inability to the point of folly' and 'the handicapping of the logos' by which the idiotic posture of the artist is superimposed on the idio- tic condition of objects, so that - as he puts it - 'being an idiot, the artist becomes stupid through the process of production' (p. 15). In short, punchy sections with titles like 'the invention of laughter', 'experimentation against experience' and 'the idiot as seer' Jouannais makes increasingly bold and far-reaching claims for the utility of his central term. However, it is not until he begins to deal directly with examples of contemporary practice that his argument falls into place. Because L'idiotie is a dense, often perverse book, and so quite likely to lead the reader astray, I will limit the detail of this review to two of the principal thematic sec- tions - two kinds of winning stupidity: 'The illusion of fantasy' (which deals with the p6riod vache) and 'revolt of the mediocrities'. There is also an astounding chapter on fountains (including hair fountains), the title of which translates as something like 'The hydraulic fart of anxiety' passing effortlessly from Hubert Robert to Alighierro Boetti, via Pascal and Apollinaire.9 Magritte's p6riod vache is introduced here by his long-time collaborator and fellow countryman Louis Scutenaire, offering the following warning: 'laugh all you want ... we haven't put our weapons on the rack, the moment will come when the gun you mistook for a pipe 508 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 30.3 2007</page><page sequence="3">Reviews goes off in your eye' (p. 78). Jouannais reads Magritte's 1948 Paris adventure (his first solo show there for many years) as a manifestation of this Belgian belligerence: the return of a long-neglected 'country bumpkin' to the heart of the French metropolitan art scene. Magritte, he suggests, did not want to disappoint (and instead sought to confirm) the low expectations of Parisian snobs. The 17 canvases and 12 gouaches were tossed off in just five weeks and the results, as Jouannais describes, were deliberately irredeemable, offering no intellectual perch whatsoever. It was a gesture directed pointedly at the insecurities of the art market that Magritte had played so astutely for years and, predicta- bly perhaps, nothing sold. This 'failure' raises a key question for Jouannais: was the periode vache, a 'wave of insanity and inhuman laughter,' a flight into fantasy, or was it perhaps the real Magritte? The artist later claimed that he was happy for the first and only time in his working life in those five torrid weeks. Appropriately enough in relation to a one-time surrealist like Magritte, the key term in Jouannais's critique is 'fantasy', which he distinguishes from the genuine effective idiocy of the period vache. Fantasy, Jouannais says, from Roussel to Dali, is decorative and repressive, 'the eruption of kitsch judgement in the field of the avant-garde' (p. 88). Idiocy by contrast, epitomised historically in this instance by Leon-Paul Fargue's Epaisseurs, and then in the equally obscure contemporary examples of Emmanuelle Pireyre, Natalie Quintaine and Bernhard Johannes Blume, is jubi- lant burlesque, a reversal of values where 'thinking and inertia, intelligence and non-thought swap their positions and functions.' There are, as Jouannais puts it (turning a wonderful phrase) 'always lumps in the ideal, suspended in the philosophical soup' (p. 96). What is clearly at stake for Jouannais is the idea of a militant rejection of the values expected and accommodated by the art world at a particular time: in this instance Magritte is idioti- cally and disastrously honest in the face of an audience primed for his knowing semiotic cynicism. Idiocy is therefore historically, culturally and politically contin- gent: a fact underscored nicely by the belated rehabilita- tion of Magritte's period vache in the light of recent practice. Jouannais (who discusses Bataille on laughter in his introduction) seems to refer here to the time- constrained 'sudden flights into humour' that Bataille saw as being intrinsic to the work of both Sade and Goya: exemplary 'lumps' in the enlightenment philosophi- cal melting pot.10 Jouannais is clear, moreover, that 'a history of idiocy is thus not a history of laughter' (p. 17). It could be argued here that, despite his broad sense of its relevance, Jouannais tends towards a kind of exclusive idiocy from which too many artists are disquali- fied, resulting in somewhat idiosyncratic choices on his part. In this case, starting with the period vache as an exemplary 'failure', Jouannais precludes himself from dis- cussing any of the more successful artists with whom some kind of relation might be found (Kippenberger, Prince or Condo, to repeat the examples mentioned above). On a purely informative level this is unproblematic, bringing to the fore neglected practices and individuals, but the niggling side-effects of this strategy are the doubts it raises about the quality (and longevity) of the examples chosen. It could be argued, perhaps, that some of Jouannais's idiots deserve their ignominious fates. Although to be fair to Jouannais, it is precisely this notion of the efficacy of failure that ushers in the more substantial and convincing argument of his next chapter: 'revolt of the mediocrities'. The phrase 'revolt of the mediocrities' is taken from Robert Filliou, and his 1977 post-card work Idiot-ci, idiot-la (Ample Food For Stupid Thought), opens the chapter of the same name (p. 101). Other concepts from Filliou frame the discussion that follows, including the triumph of invention over composition, and the rising star of non-specialised activity in contemporary practice. For Jouannais, evidently, drawing on work of the late 1970s, the revolt of mediocrity is about extending an existing territory, with humble, impoverished forms being the insurgents' weapons of choice. In support of this thesis Jouannais suggests productive links between Jim Shaw's Thrift Store Paintings (collected from 1974 to 2000) and Georges Courteline's 'mus6e des horreurs', assembled at the end of the nineteenth century and including two paintings by Henri 'Douannier' Rousseau. 'I buy them systematically', Courteline is quoted as saying; 'the most ridiculous funny sketches, the most hideous daubs. The misanthrope in me takes great plea- sure in contemplating this irrefutable proof of human stupidity' (p. 102). The connection to Shaw's interest in the 'catastrophic' canvases of amateurs is then extended to artists whose own practices plunder the meagre resources of the skills that they lack. Gabriele di Matteo's History Stripped Bare consists of 104 'naive' school-book style paintings of key (and peripheral) events from Italian history in which all the protagonists are comically naked: Hitler and Mussolini in Rome, The Pope meeting Yasser Arafat, Tony Blair and family holidaying in Tuscany. Di Matteo does not paint these works himself, instead passing on his instructions for the illustrations to acceptably unskilled 'artisans'. It is this distancing of the artist from the med- iocre results of his delegating (a perversion of the usual artist-studio assistant relationship) that sets di Matteo apart from the kind of knowing hamfistedness seen in paintings by contemporary artists either unfamiliar or not usually associated with the medium. An example of this tendency would be Jake and Dinos Chapman's Painting for Pleasure and Profit at the 2006 Frieze Art Fair, where the brothers painted portraits every half an hour for eager, fee-paying collectors." The exercise swiftly des- cended into a production line for farcical, puerile, inane excuses for paintings: less clever pastiche than miserable inadequacy (although the overall results, installed in the Tate Liverpool retrospective Bad Art for Bad People had a hilarious charm). Nearer perhaps to the spirit that Jouannais finds in di Matteo and Shaw, however, was the OXFORD ART JOURNAL 30.3 2007 509</page><page sequence="4">Reviews brothers' 1999 project GCSE Art Exam (also in the Tate Liverpool show), in which they anonymously submitted portfolios for the British high school art qualification.12 Jake Chapman's submission (for which he was awarded a grade B) included watercolours of key 'YBA' works from the Royal Academy's landmark Sensation exhibition in which the brothers' work was featured at the time. For Jouannais, such mediocrity is a vibrant, destabilising ingredient in the production of works of art, which effects a kind of affirmative automatism: injecting life back into atrophied artistic processes. By far the most endearing and tragic examples proposed in this context by Jouannais, however, are Jonathan Monk's Waiting for Famous People (which sees Monk waiting with pathetic airport taxi cards for Marcel Duchamp, Salvador Dali and Andy Warhol) and the work of Joachim Mogarra. Characterised brilliantly by Jouannais as 'unencumbered by effort', Mogarra's under- whelming landscapes feature small unremarkable house- hold objects posing as dramatic views: four half-opened books on a desk as Tents on the Beach and five stacked sugar cubes as The Tower of Babel (p. 111) The quaint, almost desperate level of pretence is developed in another of Mogarra's photographic series entitled I Like to Ride Scooters. Here, Mogarra, armed with only a crash helmet and set of detached handlebars, stages a series of delusional Don Quixote-style adventures in which he 'overtakes a car' (four people sitting on chairs steering with a dustbin lid), and passes a 'horse' at the side of a road (a person holding a photograph of a horse's head over their face). In examples like this, as Jouannais makes clear, the pathetic nature of the enter- prise offers evidence of the glorious triumph of stupidity: the lack of material resources, technical skill and pro- duction values results in a level of inventiveness and spontaneity unavailable to, and thus absent from, much so-called 'serious' contemporary practice. Such endea- vours deflate and unseat the pretentious figure of the artist-mastermind through their very refusal to engage in the same terms or make the same claims. For Jouannais, the non-heroic self-representation of idiot-artists directly opposes both this modernist mythology of the artist, and the post-structuralist alternative (the disappearance of the author into the work: 'Idiocy' he says, 'coincides with the impossibility of following the sirens and disap- pearing into the work. Idiocy in art, itself a voluntary idiocy, revindicated and instrumentalised, constitutes in this way, a manner of resisting disappearance' (p. 126). Where, we might ask, does this leave idiocy as a his- torical model for understanding contemporary practice? Some way away from the kind of retrospective rehabilita- tions associated with contemporary curatorial gambits played out around Duchamp, Picabia or Magritte, to be sure: it is hard to imagine a punchy, effective exhibition like Dada's Boys drawn from this theoretical position. However, Jouannais is not thinking like a curator; his position is more akin to that of a collaborator or conspirator: an insider offering a warning, like Louis Scutenaire writing about Magritte, alarmed and seduced in equal measure. For this reason perhaps, L'idiotie is something of a masterpiece, despite its flaws and short- comings. It is partisan, incoherent and wayward, draws unlikely, tenuous links and makes over-bold, provocative claims, but it is also honest, inspiring and curiously laid- back. Jouannais it seems, is not interested in being persuasive or convincing: on the contrary, the effect of reading L'idiotie is to provoke serious questions about the nature of all manner of apparent acts of artistic stu- pidity, rather than the coherence of the book or its argu- ment. In fact, looking for a way to sum up L'idiotie I found myself keen to employ an idiotic tactic and just take someone else's words. Ralph Rugoff's description of the work of Erwin Wurm fits L'idiotie perfectly: 'it is precisely in its lightness, in its acts of spectacular meaninglessness, that this work insinuates a deep sense of despair and doubt.'13 It is with this despair and doubt that I return, finally, to David Hopkins's Dada's Boys, a constructive argu- ment around a solid theme rather than an endless open- ing up of discursive problems: something that readers with a variety of interests and perspectives will find chal- lenging, relevant and useful. The issue again, however, is the relationship between past and present that Jouannais wants to throw into disarray: 'it's a given' he says of the legacy of Dada, 'that the modern epic, legiti- mised by its rationalist cautions, its progressive prin- ciples, cannot keep in active circulation, modes of thought and action marked by archaicism ... these archaic traces, seen here as types of esotericism, show, bizarrely, the importance of an idiotic tradition in the art of the twentieth century' (p. 205). The Dada tradition, he suggests, comes bizarrely to stand for a kind of wisdom in relation to twentieth-century art, a wisdom bound up with, and inseparable from, idiocy. Dada's Boys suggests precisely such a complex negotiation of the strategic value of throwaway gestures by linking artists like Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons with each other and with forebears like Duchamp. It should be noted, however, that the associations that Hopkins makes are always problematised to mine obvious differences as effectively as apparent similarities. 'How does Koons's conception of art differ from that of Duchamp?', Hopkins asks. His answer, or one of them anyway, runs as follows: 'While Duchamp had a dandyish disdain for the art market ... Koons understood his prac- tice to be quintessentially entrepreneurial ... However, if Koons transgressed against Duchamp by effectively returning the readymade to the store from which it had been bought, he displayed a renewed interest in the sexual connotations, especially masculine ones, of mass-produced objects ... he returns in this respect to the concerns of Duchamp and Picabia' (pp. 39-40). This is a neat and persuasive argument, and Hopkins makes it very well, filling in the necessary social-historical and political contexts (1980s consumerism and its associ- ated sexual politics) to argue for a kind of enlightened 510 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 30.3 2007</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 'laddism' in Koons's work that entitles, or enables, him to be taken seriously. The examples that Hopkins discusses fit this thesis perfectly, with the possible exception of the 'pornographic' 1990-1991 series Made in Heaven, which, (given that it features the artist being fellated) Hopkins accurately describes as 'tongue-in-cheek'. Made in Heaven is an exceptional piece of work in many ways but there is nevertheless something deeply idiotic about it: its excessive, ridiculous, desperate staging of genuine corporeal performance seems as determined as the most impenetrable p6riod vache Magritte to ricochet endlessly around the rationalising rhetoric of the commercial art world. Made in Heaven, and its now canonical place in serious collections of post-war art, suggests that Tzara's maxim still holds good and that Koons is 'an idiot, like all of you' (and many of us). Hopkins sees 'further explorations of morally equivocal boyish tropes' in the work of Koons's contemporaries Richard Prince and Martin Kippenberger (p. 47). Here it is also interesting to note that these are the very same artists descended from Magritte's p6riod vache in Magritte and Contemporary Art. It would seem therefore that either Kippenberger and Prince have some kind of polyvalent relevance to early twentieth-century avant- gardes or the mad, vache-period Magritte had much more in common with the cool calculations of Duchamp, Picabia and Man Ray than might previously have been imagined. Once again, Jouannais's assertion of the tri- umph of idiocy over both the modernist mythology of the artist and the post-modern 'disappearance' of the artist into the work seems relevant. For Hopkins, 'with its emphasis on authorial disappearance, Prince's work could easily be theorised as representing a continuation of the leftist conceptualist currents of the 1960s and 70s ... Prince could therefore be seen as intellectually respectable, while Koons was held in deep suspicion' (pp. 47-8). This perceptive comparison (which gets to the heart of the riddle of retrospective legacy politics) is further complicated by Hopkins's reference to Prince's 'ambiguous attitude to political correctness' in the mid 1980s (p. 48). An ambiguity under pressure at the time (as Hopkins notes) but since utterly shattered, it could be argued, by Prince's spattered 'Nurse' paintings, which take political correctness to the cleaners.14 Not that this disturbs Hopkins's success in tracing the power driving these recent works as far back as Dada. It seems, rather, that Duchamp, Man Ray and Picabia (par- ticularly) set out a series of problems that have yet to cease yielding productive solutions. The rub comes with the problematic nature of the relationship between the apparently nonchalant, throw away gestures of the forefathers, and the calculated, too-easily commodified disobedience of subsequent gener- ations. Here too, the politics of idiocy runs up and down the Dada's Boys family tree: the ludic chaos of Paul McCarthy and John Bock acts as a counterweight to the glossy professionalism of Koons and Matthew Barney. While Hopkins understandably avoids tracing an inheri- tance of mediocrity, ineptitude and failure, there are nevertheless some marvellous 'p6riod vache' moments in his account. Damien Hirst and Angus Fairhurst's short video A Couple of Cannibals Eating a Clown (I Should Coco) is described as follows 'the two artists [are] sitting in a bar, obviously drunk, wearing clown regalia, and swap- ping horrifically gruesome stories about traffic accidents and crimes. They manage to remain disconcertingly dead- pan throughout, but eventually crack up laughing': proof, if any were needed, that even the most image-conscious, ambitious and successful artist is capable of occasional, inspired lapses into idiocy.
