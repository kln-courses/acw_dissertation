<plain_text><page sequence="1">Political Theory and International Relations by Charles R. Beitz. Princeton, N.J., Princeton University Press, 1979. 212 pp. Cloth, $16.50; paper, $3.95. "Political theory," writes Charles Beitz, "arises from a perception of the possibility of choice" (p. 4). The word "theory" has been used and abused in so many ways in the con- temporary literature of international relations that readers may be grateful that Beitz so promptly makes it clear that "choice" is the key word and its clarification the task of the normative theorist. In part one he effectively disposes of the argument that in a Hobbes- ian world of states the states have no choice but to behave like amoral anthropomorphic monsters. In part two he seeks to delimit, both positively and negatively, the range of choice that his cosmopolitan ethic would afford each state. International distributive justice is the subject of the third and final part. This compact and scholarly study may be compared with two books written by one of Beitz's predecessors at Swarthmore College, Kenneth N. Waltz. Like Waltz in his first book, Man, the State and War, Beitz demonstrates a mastery of the relevant classics in Western political thought. Waltz's most recent book, Theory of International Politics, is as specialized in its focus and ambitious in its title as Political Theory and International Relations, but the two books are as different as night and day. Modern philosophy of science and the classical tradition in normative theory provide very different refracting lenses through which to peer at politics among nations in the absence of central authority. The best writing in international relations of the past half-century has not been devoid of normative concerns, but one may ask why a good book such as Beitz's in which these concerns are made explicit has been so long in coming. One answer may be that believers in a utopia of science and reason evaded rigorous analysis of hard choices by trying to convert them into difficult but solvable problems. A second may be that in the presence of identifiable evil during the years of Hitler and Stalin the choices were not hard at all, and broad assertions about the national interest did not seem to need challenging. A third answer may be that with the waning of Cold War I many scholars wearied of serving as instruments of national policy in a private capacity and chose to escape into methodology and advanced research technology, and a not very well-rooted empiricism that gave full play to both. A fourth may be the conventional separation made in the political science curriculum between the study of politics within states and the study of politics between states and the perception that political theory is part of the domestic half of the discipline. In this pioneering study Beitz satisfies every legitimate expectation that his preface</page><page sequence="2">718 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY creates in the mind of his reader. He occasionally takes positions that are not essential to his analysis and that leave him open to flank attack. Thus, his stated goal, "to work out a more satisfactory international normative political theory through a critique and revision of orthodox views" (p. vii), carries the questionable implication that realist skepticism in the fashion of Hobbes and Hans J. Morgenthau is the orthodox, the traditional, and the dominant stance of political scientists specializing in international relations. Because Beitz stands so squarely in the voluntarist American tradition of belief in the reality of significant choice, his critique of the realist skeptics is an essential element of his analysis; but he need not have conceded dominance to a "tradition" which in the American study of international relations was more important in the 1950s and 1960s than before or since. In his occasional assertions of the incompatibility for statesmen, as well as for ordinary men and women, of the dictates of morality on the one hand and prudence, expediency, self-interest, and advantage on the other, Beitz may also be saying either too much or too little. I think he may be giving too short shrift to enlightened self-interest. Everyone bends their efforts toward making the future more like the one they want than it would be if they did nothing. The moral person's interest is in a future in which his moral principles are implemented and his actions toward that end promote his self-respect. As Quincy Wright observed, "Ethics is long-run expediency, and expediency is short-run ethics." Finally, it does not seem to have been necessary to treat two topics as different as in- tervention and national self-determination under the rubric "autonomy of states." The ra- tionale for intervention in the case of a new Emperor Bokassah, a new Idi Amin, or a new Dracula is that there are some elementary freedoms that the international system ought to guarantee individuals everywhere and even against their own governments. The rationale for national self-determination is autonomy for peoples, not autonomy for states. Political Theory and International Relations will be useful to serious students of inter- national relations for many years to come. WILLIAM T. R. Fox Columbia University</page></plain_text>
