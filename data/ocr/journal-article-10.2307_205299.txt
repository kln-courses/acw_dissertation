By Edward Shorter (New York, Free Press, 1992) 419 pp. $24.95 In the nineteenth century, hysterical symptoms such as contractures of upper and lower extremities-these figured among the complaints of Josef Breuer's patient Anna 0.-were widespread. In the later twentieth century they seem to have disappeared-paralysis occupies a minor place in the current diagnostic criteria for somatization disorder. Anyone even minimally familiar with psychotherapy and its history must have won- dered: Where have all the hysterics gone? Shorter's book tackles this question: psychosomatic symptoms, he argues, have a history; there is a fit between environment and symptoms, and when the environmental niche for hysterical symptoms was radically altered, the number of reported paralyses declined. What does Shorter mean by psychosomatic? What are the salient features of the environment? How does fit come about? In answer to the first question, Shorter points to two forms of somatization. "In one no physical lesion of any kind exists and the symptoms are literally psychogenic; that is to say, they arise in the mind. In the second an organic lesion does exist, but the patient's response to it-his or her illness behavior-is exaggerated or inappropriate" (x). These two forms closely correspond to Freud's initial notion of conversion-the transfor- mation of psychical excitation into somatic symptoms, and his subse- quent notion of somatic compliance-the participation of both the so- matic and the psychical sides in symptom formation.1 Freud let conversion languish: he admitted that the leap from the mental to the somatic remained incomprehensible; Shorter, in contrast, pushes the psychogenic to the fore. In answer to the second question, he points to a number of features, all cultural, the salience of which changed over time. And finally, in the mechanics of fit, the patient's unconscious goes to work. Given a relatively unchanging "symptom pool," it is the unconscious that selects, choosing only those symptoms "thought to be legitimate organic disease" (3). Shorter's mechanism may be unsatisfactory-an anthropomorphic unconscious finely attuned to current cultural tastes may offend the explanatory sensibilities of most social scientists-but his historical account is rich and fascinating. Shorter organizes that account in terms of paradigms. Because of their scientific connotations, these serve him well; they lend weight to his argument that from the early nineteenth century until sometime in the twentieth, medical science proved the salient environmental feature, and that psychosomatic illness had become the object of what he re- peatedly refers to as "medical shaping." Before I8oo, he contends, such I See Josef Breuer and Sigmund Freud, Studies on Hysteria (Vienna, 1895) in James Strachey (trans. and ed.), The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud (London, 1955), II, 206; Freud, "Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria" (Vienna, 1905) in Standard Edition (London, 1953), VII, 40.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS | 347 illness owed little to medical theories: "most patients did not come into contact with physicians but rather with midwives, herbalists, and other such paramedical figures" (13). And in the late twentieth century, he claims, doctors have lost their authority: "dominant medical paradigms ... fall unheeded in the babble of media interviews" (314). Overarching, then, the history of paradigms, looms the rise and fall of medical influ- ence. If the use of the Kuhnian term leads readers to expect a precise chronological and/or geographical tracking of successive paradigms, they will be disappointed. Shorter's paradigms do not follow each other neatly. They overlap in time and space; the why and how of their prominence are not systematically examined. (Nor does all the material Shorter covers, notably dissociation and Charcot's work on hysteria, fit comfortably into this framework.)2 The real drama begins with the reflex theory-spinal irritation figures as a mere prelude. Reflex theory, Shorter writes, may have inspired motor hysteria; it certainly inspired medical meddlesomeness, producing a veritable "orgy of pelvic operations" (86). Before the century was over, a new paradigm stressing the central nervous system appeared, and along with it "nerve doctors" and neur- asthenia. As with hysteria, so too with neurasthenia, patients and doctors alike were convinced that they were dealing with real organic disease; the symptoms, they remained confident, were not all in the head. It was a certainty that did not go unquestioned. Alongside the reflex and central nervous paradigms, a third flourished, "one that emphasized the psychological origin of somatoform symptoms" (233). As early as the I88os, it began to attract support and "became the predominant explanation of psychosomatic symptoms from the I920s to the I970s" (233). It conquered the medical profession, Shorter argues, but it failed to persuade the general public. And then a curious thing happened: "the increasing penetration of the psychological paradigm within medicine sent patients scurrying away from psychiatry and into other forms of medical treatment, in which the organicity of one's symptoms was taken for granted" (233). Somatizing patients, rather than seeking psycho- therapy, reacted with horror at the prospect. "Given the reluctance of the unconscious mind," Shorter adds, "to be made a fool of, patients have always tended to reject psychological interpretations of physical symptoms" (26I). In the late twentieth century mass media have displaced doctors in defining symptoms. Are patients better off? "When medical authority prevails and doctors shape symptoms under the influence of various 'paradigms,' patients risk having their ovaries needlessly removed or their spines cauterized. When the media take on the job, patients are whipped about by the disease-of-the-month syndrome, because the de- sire for novelty is relentless" (320). Either way, there is no escaping 2 Jean-Martin Charcot, Lefons sur les maladies du systeme nerveux faites d la Salpetriere (Paris, 1880).</page><page sequence="3">348 LOUISE A. TILLY "some cultural interpretation" (320). And the aspect of culture to which Shorter draws attention in his final pages is the fragility of the family, with the suggestion that increased social isolation "by removing 'feed- back loops' . . . intensifies the tendency of individuals" to cling to self- diagnoses in a fixed and rigid fashion. "In the nineteenth century," he concludes, "the 'restricted' Victorian woman gave us an image of the motor hysteria common among women. In the late twentieth century somatization has become the lot of both sexes. Both men and women have been victims of the shattering of the family, and both experience the kinds of pain and fatigue distinctive to our century" (322). Either way, psychosomatic illness will always be with us. Judith M. Hughes University of California, San Diego Communities of Grain: Rural Rebellion in Comparative Perspective. By Vic- tor V. Magagna (Ithaca, Cornell University Press, I991) 277 pp. $42.50 Calling for a community-based understanding of rural rebellion, Ma- gagna has written a study comparing early modern England, France, Spain, Russia, and Japan. He includes Japan because it enables him to claim greater theoretical applicability for his conclusions. The reason Japan widens the net is because it has often been seen as culturally distinct from the West, and because it serves as a "proxy for the whole sweep on non-Western history prior to the impact of European colonialism" (xi). With evidence from historians' detailed monographs, Magagna shows the inadequacy of other social scientists' theoretical and empirical understanding of conditions under which rural rebellion occurs, and proposes an alternative. That alternative lies between on the one hand, theories (like those of Tawney, Polanyi, Brenner, Moore, Charles Tilly, and Skocpol) which see large-scale structural change (particularly capi- talist commercialization or state formation) as central to rural protest, and, on the other, theories that, in his view, overemphasize common values and cooperation in rural communities. Here Taylor and Thomp- son are implicated. Magagna argues that the first group puts too much emphasis on class and revolution (or other state-level phenomena); the second underestimates local tensions and conflict when they speak nos- talgically of a moral economy. He reconceptualizes the problem from the bottom up.' I Richard H.
