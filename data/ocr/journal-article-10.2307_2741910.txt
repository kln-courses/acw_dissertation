<plain_text><page sequence="1">Luba Roots: The First Complete Iron Age Sequence in Zaire by PIERRE DE MARET Section de Prehistoire et d'Archeologie, Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren, B-1980, Belgium. 30 viii 78 During the 19th century, the Luba exercised hegemony over a wide area of the savanna just southeast of the Central Afri- can forest. Not far from the heartland of the Luba kingdom, on the shore of Lake Kisale in the Upemba rift, lies the ceme- tery of Sanga. Excavations in 1957-58 (Nenquin 1963, Hier- naux, de Longree, and De Buyst 1971) revealed various burial sites grouped primarily according to ceramic typology. Nei- ther an absolute nor a relative chronology of these groups was precisely established. Of the 145 burials excavated, only two atypical ones were radiocarbon-dated, placing the cemetery at the end of the 1st millennium A.D. A careful ethnohistorical study of the Luba state could trace its origins only as far back as the 18th century (Reefe 1975). In 1974-75, with the assistance of Kanimba Misago and the support of the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale of Tervuren and the Institut des Musees Nationaux de Zaire, I excavated not only at Sanga, but at four new sites in the Upemba de- pression as well, uncovering 120 graves. Some 40 related sites were mapped (de Maret 1977, 1978). The discovery of the same traditions at different sites led to the establishment of the first complete Iron Age sequence, precisely dated by more than 40 radiocarbon analyses. Computerized treatment of these dates and dendrochronological correction of the results showed that the Iron Age originated in the 5th century A.D. with the Kamilambian tradition, which then was replaced by the Ki- salian tradition at the end of the 8th century. The Ancient Kisalian gave way to the Classic Kisalian in the 11th century. A third tradition, the Kabambian, appeared at the end of the 14th century. Changes in ritual, pottery, and currency permit a distinction between a Kabambian A and B, the latter ending at the beginning of the 19th century. This is precisely when the Luba state emerged, and vestiges of this period are char- acteristic of Luba practices as described by ethnographers and still seen today. The Luba region has been considered by linguists, following Guthrie (1962), as the nucleus of Proto-Bantu and thus as an early center of metallurgy. In contrast, my excavations show that the Iron Age started significantly later in the Upemba depression than in the interlacustrine region. The age and ty- pology of the pottery clearly relate the Kamilambian to the Early Iron Age of northwestern Zambia, the so-called Western Stream (Phillipson 1975, 1976), which I prefer to call the Early Iron Age Copperbelt Industry. This is distinct from the Kalambo Early Iron Age Industry (Clark 1974) immediately to the east. Villages were established on the shores of the numerous lakes and streams of the Upemba depression. These sites have been in use since the Early Iron Age, with little or no lateral movement. Frequently, the same spot served alternately as set- tlement site, field, and cemetery. Because the few habitation layers uncovered were never preserved laterally, it was impos- sible to map them. Some fragments of daub with impressions of reeds were collected from the Kamilambian layer. From that point onwards, it seems that most huts were made only of wattle. This explains why so few traces of habitations were found. In contrast, the numerous burials and grave goods pro- vide invaluable information on the evolution of these societies. Continuity in the pottery can be traced from the Kamilambian to the Luba. Kisalian pottery is extremely well-crafted, its complex profile frequently enhanced by a spout or a handle. Its originality distinguishes it from all other Central African pottery. Kabambian pottery, much less elaborate, is character- ized in its second phase by a red slip. In addition to the ceramics, the collection of metal objects found in the Upemba rift is one of the largest ever discovered in an excavation in Black Africa. A Kamilambian shaft, the only probable grave of this type, yielded an axe, barbed arrow- heads, a curved knife, a spearhead, and a possible wornout iron hoe. The Kisalian graves contained numerous iron ob- jects: hoes, knives, axes, spears, arrows, harpoon heads, fish- hooks, necklaces, elaborate pendants, and a small link chain. Iron objects such as necklaces are less common in the Ka- bambian graves; however, the shape of the hoes remains much the same. There is no evidence of copper in the Kamilambian; it first appears with a few Ancient Kisalian objects, mainly in the form of hammered bangles. Copper abounds in the Classic Kisalian, where it was used not only for ornaments Vol. 20 ? No. 1 ?

Ivory carvings as well as proof of basket weaving were also found. One of the main characteristics of the Kabambian is the presence of copper in the form of croisettes (crosses), used originally as ingots and later as currency. In the course of the Kabambian, the crosses diminish in size and become more uniform. Although they were probably first used as a special-purpose currency (bridewealth, for example), they gradually evolved into an all- purpose unit of value. The decrease can be seen as a response to the demand of a true currency for smaller units. These copper crosses, which are well dated, provide a valuable clue for dating other sites in Shaba. The large amount of copper in circulation during the Classic Kisalian indicates intensive trade with the Copperbelt 200 km to the south. A typical anthropomorphic Kisalian bottle found halfway between the Upemba rift and the mines attests to such a relationship. Trade with the people of the Indian Ocean coastal region during the Classic Kisalian is demonstrated by the presence of cowrie shells. These contacts increased during the Kabambian, in which cowrie shells and glass beads were more abundant; in one case, a Conus shell disc was also found. The principal means of subsistence of the inhabitants of the Upemba rift was fishing. In the Kisalian period, numerous fishhooks and harpoons of all sizes were buried with the dead, and remains of fish were found inside the grave pots. A special kind of trilobate brazier used at the time is still employed by fishermen in certain areas of Central Africa for cooking done in the pirogues. In addition to fishing, agriculture was practiced on the fertile alluvial soil of the rift. Hoes and grinding stones are found in all of the various traditions. Kisalian pots in the shape of a calabash demonstrate the presence of Lagenaria sp.; Elais (guineensis?) was present in the Kamilambian, and Eleusine (corocana?) in the Kabambian. During the Kisalian, domesticated animals-goats and chickens -were raised, while elephants, antelopes, hippopotami, and crocodiles were hunted. The variety and number of food sources provided a rich diet and encouraged population growth. Fish has remained the main export product; it was part of long-distance trade when the first Europeans entered Luba country. Thus, fish must have been traded by the inhabitants of the Upemba rift in exchange for copper and other imported goods. A study of Kisalian funerary practices reveals a relationship between age and the burial ritual; adults were buried deeper than children and children deeper than infants. The body was interred in decubitus dorsal, its feet placed downstream in re- lation to the Zaire River. Much of the pottery found in the graves was made solely for burial. In children's graves the size of the pots is proportional to the age. It is obvious that a lot of the pottery was symbolic, constructed on a small scale and therefore not suitable for normal use. Since it was impos- sible to distinguish between male and female skeletons, I di- vided the grave goods into two distinct groups, composed of objects which were never associated in the same grave. Pre- sumed masculine goods were a human jaw on the belt, knives, and harpoons; presumed feminine ones included grinding stones and cannon bones of goat or antelope. These cannon bones, especially frequent in children's graves, were apparently used as dolls, probably in relation to a fertility cult. The few graves containing an unusually large number of pots also contained uncommon items such as cowries and ivory pendants. Mem- bership in this wealthy minority was partially hereditary, since it included children. The craftsmanship of Kisalian iron, copper, ivory, bone, and pottery indicates the presence of professional artisans. Marked social stratification is observed as early as the Ancient Kisalian in the existence of ceremonial axes, their handles decorated with nails, much like those found recently among the Luba as symbols of authority. In one case, an iron anvil, another corn- mon symbol of power among the Bantu-speaking groups, was found in a grave associated with such an axe. The iron bell with a clapper found in this period may also be related to authority. It is possible that children were sacrificed to accom- pany the body of an important person. This practice was found in Katoto, a cemetery belonging to a tradition roughly con- temporaneous with the Kisalian in the southern part of the Upemba rift (Hiernaux, Maquet. and De Buyst 1972). The two traditions had only episodic contact, but that they had achieved similar levels of social organization is evidenced by the presence of ceremonial axes and anvils in the richest Ka- totian graves. The emergence of a hierarchical society at the end of the 1st millennium is clearly not due to long-distance trade or the influence of European and Arabic traders, but rather the re- sult of local factors. The quantity of foodstuffs provided by fishing permitted a high population density around the lake that led to a need for political integration. The necessity for collective action to exploit the lakes and rivers to their maxi- mum may also have been an incentive for political develop- ment, as Reefe (1975:153) has suggested. Fish was surely im- portant in the intertribal trade which helped to produce a cer- tain degree of social stratification and political centralization. Thus, Kisalian society seems to be one of the early steps in the development of the powerful kingdoms of the savanna. The continuity and density of the occupation as well as the persistence of certain customs from the Kisalian to the present indicate that the mass of the population remained much the same through time. The changes which occurred, for example, between the Kisalian and Kabambian periods could have re- sulted from the presence of invading groups as well as from the growing influence of the outside world. The fact that the numerous lakes could have been used as refuge areas would also have favored continuity. Anthropometric study (Hiernaux, Plantier, and De Buyst n.d.) of today's Luba and of skeletons found at Sanga and Katoto also shows strong affinities among the three groups. It becomes apparent that in establishing an Iron Age sequence in the Upemba rift one is actually studying the emergence of the Luba kingdom. Just how much confidence one can have in the oral tradi- tions of the kingdoms of the savanna remains a problem for historians and ethnographers. From a methodological point of view, it is therefore important to compare the archaeological findings with Luba oral tradition. Today's Luba would regard the skeletons found in our excavations-Kisalian and even Kabambian-as the enemies of their ancestors. Yet even oral tradition speaks of invaders from the east who brought with them new customs and the croisettes, evoking the archaeolog- ical change from Kisalian to Kabambian. Another possible correlation is that the custom of filing the upper front teeth into an inverted V was known as early as the Kisalian period, and the hero who introduced this practice is said to have ini- tiated royal etiquette as well; this may be a metaphoric refer- ence to the appearance of the stratified Kisalian society.
