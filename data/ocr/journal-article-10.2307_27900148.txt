<plain_text><page sequence="1">MR. GERALD CATOR'S SCHOLASTIC GOD-IDEA. Mr. Gerald Cator's article "Id Quo Majus Cogitari Nequit" is indeed what he calls it, "a scholastic essay." The character of his whole thought is scholastic and its deductions follow the method of scholastic logic. Modern thought has become alienated from this method of argumentation, and we feel sure that naturalists will simply turn their backs upon it. Nevertheless the article contains a good deal of thought which because of a general opposition to scholasticism is at present neglected. We are keenly conscious of the shortcomings of this almost mediaeval mode of thought, and it seems strange that there are thinkers to-day who cling to it with such tenacity. But modern thinkers, especially naturalists, are apt to overlook the objective significance of pure logic and of all the interrelations implied in purely formal thought. It is for this reason that we deem it worth while to understand scholasticism and to pre serve what is true in it. Mr. Cator is certainly right when he insists, "that if to any degree we know anything, we can not be perfectly ignorant of any thing else.... Blank ignorance as to the nature of things is in the strictest sense impossible.... Once true, always true, etc."-truths so often ignored by both the agnostics and the pragmatists. Our thought indeed tells us something about the nature of reality, and modern naturalists use the same scholastic arguments much more than they themselves know. There is more apriorism even in a man like Haeckel than he himself is aware, although the modern naturalist is in the habit of denouncing apriorism and com monly thinks himself free from it. The editor has treated Mr. Cator's subject in a recently pub lished book entitled God: An Inquiry into the Nature of Man's Highest Ideal and a Solution of the Problem from the Standpoint of Science, and there is an agreement in the titles themselves, though Mr. Cator expresses it in abstract and more ponderous style for which the Latin language is more appropriate, saying "Id Quo Majus Cogitare Nequit" Considering the result, the agreement as well as the differences are obvious. While we believe in a center that</page><page sequence="2">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 633 can not be shifted or changed, we insist that the center is not of an individual nature, it is not a particular place, it is not a personality after the fashion of man. The very expression "center" is purely allegorical, for it is a center which is omnipresent; it is an ideal center. It is a center only in the sense that the normative factors of the world constitute a unity, a systematic and consistent whole, but it is not local nor does it partake of any of the characteristics of particularity. Accordingly we see in Mr. Catons scholastic treatment of the subject an anthropomorphic statement of a truth of which he has caught a glimpse, and the significance of which he has understood as an astrologer may grasp the grandeur of astronomical truths.
