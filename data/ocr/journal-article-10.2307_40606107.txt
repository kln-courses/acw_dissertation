Heraldry for the dead: memory, identity, and the engraved stone plaques of Neolithic Iberia, xii, 218 pp., maps, figs, tables, illus., bibliogr. Austin: Univ. Texas Press, 2008. £33.00 (cloth) The slate plaques of southwestern Iberia must count among the most enigmatic objects to have come down to us from European later prehistory. They are remarkable by their sheer number (with between 2,000 and 4,000 surviving examples), and by the regularity of their shape and their striking decoration; yet they are also unremarkable, easy, and quick to make, requiring no specialist skill, and are made of materials that in themselves are not particularly rare or valuable. The slate plaques are found in southern Portugal and adjacent areas of Spain, mainly south of the Tagus, with a particular concentration in the central Alentejo. The latter is the source of the dominant raw materials (notably slate), and Lillios makes a good case that the tradition of making these plaques may have originated in that region. The plaques are engraved with cross-hatched geometric motifs of various kinds that evoke textile patterns. Most of them are decorated on only one face, and are perforated for suspension. The majority were deposited in funerary contexts, and they fall chronologically within the Late Neolithic period between 3500 and 2800 BC. With a few exceptions, however, we lack detailed information about their context and, crucially, about their precise association with human remains. It is against this background that Katina Lillios has over the past ten years been developing new avenues of inquiry into the study of the plaques, seeking to free them from the Mother Goddess association which all too frequently has dominated their interpretation. Her first step was to establish a comprehensive online database of the plaques (ESPRIT), most of which she has studied at first hand in museum collections. This labour of love furnished the essential corpus for a detailed comparative investigation of plaque design, allowing her to distinguish a series of ten groups on the basis of shape and decoration. Her key conclusions can be summarized under three heads. In first place, experimental work carried out with the help of graduate student Alex Woods demonstrated that the plaques could easily and quickly be made by non-specialists. Furthermore, the wear patterns that developed rapidly on replica plaques suspended round the neck were absent on most of the archaeological examples. Lillios describes her personal experience of wearing such a plaque suspended from a cord around the neck, the plaque constraining freedom of movement and frequently flipping round so that the decorated face is hidden from view. It is likely indeed that the plaques were not designed to be worn by living participants, but were produced specifically to accompany the dead. The second set of conclusions concerns the incised motifs. These are frequently divided into horizontal registers occupied by cross-hatched squares or triangles. Lillios proposes that the number of registers may have had genealogical significance, indicating, for example, the number of generations between the deceased individual buried with the plaque and some founding Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 405-454 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="2">406 Book reviews ancestor. The interpretation is persuasive and closely argued, and is supported by several separate lines of evidence. The plaques themselves can be considered anthropomorphic or zoomorphic, though they also recall polished stone axes in size, shape, and manufacture. Like archaeologists before her, Li 1 1 ¡os pays particular attention to the possible significance of the striking (though relatively rare) 'Biomorph' plaques, where the suspension holes become eyes. Here, alas, the ubiquitous 'shamanist' interpretation raises its head, but the possibility that these particular plaques represent owls, or people wearing owl-masks, underlines the diversity of roles and performances that the plaques may have been designed to evoke. The third and final set of conclusions concerns the historical and socio-political context in which the plaques were made and used. An origin in the central Alentejo region appears highly plausible, since it is there that the raw materials were available and that the stylistically least complex and potentially earliest plaques have been found. Li 1 1 ios suggests that the use of slate plaques spread from that core zone to adjacent and outlying areas, gaining increasing numbers of registers in the process, and that this may have been associated with the dispersal of a 'materialized lineage system' westwards along the Tagus valley. The interactions are not explained in detail, and the suggestion that the megalithic tombs of the Lisbon area were built by immigrants from the Alentejo will not persuade everybody. Such minor caveats aside, however, what Lillios has given us in this volume is an exemplary presentation of evidence and analysis, couched in accessible and carefully reasoned terms, that sets the plaques on a dynamic new trajectory of inquiry.
