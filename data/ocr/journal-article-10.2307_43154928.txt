<plain_text><page sequence="1">Valuations and Theories of Social Interaction JOHN KULTGEN University of Missouri Bias is the all too-human tendency to view evidence selectively so as to reinforce antecedent beliefs. The pride of science is that its methods counteract bias. Scientific theories are a function of phenomena, not preference. This is the valid core of the dogma of the neutrality of science toward values. The dogma has been expressed recently by P. E. H. Barra tt in these terms: Science, as a method of investigating the world, is amoral in the sense that there is no good or bad, no a prion value system to which appeal must first be made. In the quest for knowledge of the struc- ture and function of the universe, the objects of enquiry are just things and events that require accurate description and explanation. If this quest opens the way to atomic bombs and instruments of destruction, to bacterial and chemical warfare and other social evils, it is, from the morally neutral viewpoint of science, a sheer fact of life. If one of the social implications of discovery is to commit huge proportions of the national income to defence and the space-race when they would be spent more rationally on health, education and the removal of poverty, then science might seem to be a bad thing. Such a verdict is, of course, a value judgment based on policy, rather than a scientific statement.1 The neutrality dogma prospers in the face of a widespread recogni- tion that the values of both scientists and their patrons affect scientific inquiry all sorts of ways. Policy decisions determine what discoveries are applied, and how they are applied, to control nature and society. New values evolve from awareness of opportunities for control and as new modes of consciousness are moulded by science and technology. In turn, "pure" science is given new directions. The choices, whether science is done at all, how it is done, and how much is done, are matters for value judgment. One investigates particular phenomena because he 1 Bases of Psychological Methods (New York: Wiley, 1971), p. 20. 139</page><page sequence="2">thinks they are important. . . "things and events that require descrip- tion and explanation." One uses scientific methods because he finds that they render true, perspicuous, reliable, or elegant representations of phenomena. All of this is freely conceded; but, it is claimed, given a subject mat- ter, aim, and method, theories are functions of phenomena, not values. The content of science is value neutral. Something is wrong with the dogma. One symptom is that many scientists, especially social scientists, refer to their theoretical perspec- tives as "biases" rather than using the term in its ordinary, invidious sense. Perspectives not only should not be banned from science; they are necessary for progress. Does one's perspective reflect his values? We should expect it to since theory construction is a human activity and activities are guided by valuations. Well, it is easy to say that the separation of fact from value is unten- able; it is harder to demonstrate the interconnections of values and facts in the concrete. Given a body of evidence, the decision to accept, reject, or hold a hypothesis in abeyance requires an estimate of the harm or benefit of each choice should the hypothesis in fact be false or true. In the lively debate over the significance of this fact,2 it seems to be taken for granted that value judgments only control the disposition of hypo- theses which are already formed. Valuations, however, are at work in their very formation. I shall concentrate my remarks on the selection of conceptual frameworks for formulation of competing hypotheses in social science. It is my notion, which I cannot argue here, that more than one conceptual scheme can be applied to the same phenomena, that each may work according to its own definitions of "working" and "understanding," and that a scheme determines for its adherents what hypotheses are well formed, what data are relevant, and what methods are effective. In particular, I shall explore the influence of valuations on the con- ceptual schemes of two flourishing theories of social interaction- the descriptive behaviorism of B. F. Skinner and the phenomenological social science of several authors. How is interaction between two social beings to be defined, and how does the investigator's choice of defini- tions reflect his values? 2 See the articles by Richard Rudner, Richard C. Jeffrey, and Isaac Levi, re- printed in Readings in the Philosophy of Science , ed. by Baruch A. Brody (Engle- wood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1970), pp. 540-70, together with the bibliographies of those articles. 140</page><page sequence="3">Descriptive Behaviorism Skinner centers his attention on reinforcement processes. We ob- serve that an event in an organism's environment (the "stimulus") is followed by behavior with environmental consequences (the "oper- ant"). We observe that the frequency of the operant increases or diminishes in correlation with particular consequences ("positive and negative reinforcers" ) . Behavior is social when an operant of organism A is a stimulus for B and B's response (operant) is a reinforcer for A. Interaction is also control, since A's operant acting as a stimulus elicits B's operant, and B's operant acting as a reinforcer alters A's tendency to behave in the future. Social interaction in the fullest sense occurs when the behavior of A and B both serve as stimulus and reinforcer for each other. The complex structure of society reduces to dyadic S-R interactions between individual organisms, i.e., to events of reciprocal control. Skinner professes to eschew theory except in the sense that he has a critical view of the mission and methods of psychology.3 He posits no hidden entities; he renders the plain facts of observation. However, the "plain facts" are not so simply given as he suggests. I shall compare some concept dependent components in his treatment of identity, time, and causation with cognate components in phenomenological social science. The primary unit of behavioral analysis is the identifiable segment of behavior, treated as a unitary, recurrent pattern. The ethologist, W. C. McGrew, for example, has catalogued 111 elementary motor pat- terns of children.4 E. C. Grant describes the reactions of female chronics in a mental hospital to interviews in terms of such "behavior- al elements," e.g., the shrug (raise shoulders and drop them again), scratch (rake body with the finger tips), relaxation (loosen muscles so body slumps into chair).5 It is a commonplace among philosophers that there are always alter- native ways to analyze the flow of experience. The behaviorist singles out organisms from their context and resolves their apperances into segments of motion. These segments are not themselves simple, but are integrals of many components. A shrug, for instance, is a compli- cated movement. Nor are behavioral elements abruptly demarcated 3 Contingencies of Reinforcement (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1961), pp. vii- viii. 4 In S. J. and Corinne Hütt, Direct Observation and Measurement of Behavior (Springfield, 111.: C. C. Thomas, 1970), Appendix. 5 "Non-Verbal Behavior during Interviews," Behavior Studies in Psychiatry , ed. by S. J. and Corinne Hütt (Oxford: University Press, 1970), pp. 71-72. 141</page><page sequence="4">from each other. A shrug flows continuously into the following operant, e.g., relaxing or scratching the head. Furthermore, individual shrugs differ in countless minute ways, which are ignored in classing them as the "same" element. Some portions of a behavioral element are posited rather than observed, e.g., the continued existence of fingers as they disappear into bushy hair to scratch the scalp. The integration of com- plex movements into one operant, the delimitation of the operant from other operants, the filling out of observed movements with imagined ones, and the classification of diverse instances as a single type require conceptual decisions on the part of the observer to order experience for a certain purpose; they do not constitute a simple regis- tration of raw data. My examples contain a residue of mentalistic overtones- "shrug," "scratch," "relax" connote expressive and purposive functions. Pre- sumably, a strict behaviorist would strive for purely mechanical de- scriptions and refine his classifications to cover simple motions and changes of motion as described by geometrodynamics. This representa- tion of bodily movements, which is to replace their interpretation in terms of feelings and purposes, however, equally transecnds "imme- diate experience." It is expressed in terms of relations of the pheno- mena to some set of coordinates, determined by some measuring pro- cedure and presupposing a body of theory about the interaction of object systems with instruments, including the instrumentality of the observer's body. Laws of conditioning are not discovered in single cases since they refer to changes in frequency of a type of behavior given a type of stim- ulus and a type of reinforcer. The observer must retain instances in his memory or (more commonly) on data sheets. When he generalizes from data or interprets behavior in general terms, he must have re- constructed the past from memory and records. Behaviorists with their reinforcement schedules and frequency charts represent the past in terms of the clock time of physics, using theoretical time coordinataes and chronometers whose workings are interpreted by physical theories. The precise duration of an operant, for example, is clocked, and se- quences of operants are ordered and counted. By careful attention to this sort of pattern in the reconstructed past, the behaviorist is confi- dent that he can anticipate the future, again laid out according to physical clock time. Behavior is conceived to be a function of external stimulus and reinforcer events. In the present crude explanations, the causes that are identified are macroscopic events in the vicinity, but at some distance from the organism. As explanations are refined, causation will no doubt 142</page><page sequence="5">be reduced to interactions between spatiotemporally adjacent events, e.g., light signals triggering nerve impulses and muscle contractions. In any case, causal trains are represented as sequences of externally related events. Such events are distinguished from neighboring events by membership in regularly associated classes. The model of causation as the constant conjunction of discrete events defines the ideal for behaviorism. Thus descriptive behaviorism employs an elaborate body of theory to order experience, abstracting, simplifying, reconstructing, and inter- preting. It is irrelevant to my point that the theory is borrowed from physical science and common sense, that it is taken for granted by behavioral scientists and not appreciably modified by their researches. The theory may be functionally a prion for a particular way of practic- ing psychological science. It is not absolutely a prion for all modes of thought. It is the result of a decision to represent behavior and inter- action a certain way. There is an alternative. The choice between it and the alternative must be justified by benefits that accrue. This point holds double for behaviorisms such as Pavlov's, Tolman's, and Hull's, which posit theoretical variables between stimulus and response, a practice which descriptive behaviorism decries. Phenomenological Sociology According to concepts developed by Alfred Schutz,6 among others, an action is first of all an intentional act of consciousness which pro- jects a pattern of future behavior, with its likely consequences, in a situation defined by the agent. The project functions as a map to control the actual course of behavior. Since every external situation is unique, behavior governed by a given project, e.g., buying onions in a grocery store, never displays exactly the same pattern twice. The phenomenologist, in contrast to the behaviorist, identifies actions by their governing intentions or "subjective meanings" rather than by similarities in bodily movements. An agent develops a project on the basis of his perception of a situa- tion as demanding that he fill a role according to its norms, e.g., that of an honest and polite customer. His perception thus reflects his "stock of knowledge." That is, causal influences on him are mediated by his symbolic system. A factor of the situation acts on him only as he takes it into his experience and interprets it. In the process of internalization, past and future events, whose proximity in the psychic ® The Phenomenology of the Social World , tr. by George Walsh and Frederick Lehnert (Evanston, 111.: Northwestern University Press, 1967), esp. pp. 57-63 and 167-72. H3</page><page sequence="6">time of the agenťs consciousness bears no simple relation to the chronometric time of physics, enter directly into the formation of consciousness and the behavior that flows from it. Time and causality are thus internal relationships for the phenomenologist, rather than external relations between self-contained events. The significant factors in a situation are often actions of other agents. Social action occurs when an agent projects behavior in antici- pation of responsive actions of a second agent. Face-to-face interaction is the ongoing adjustment of projects and behavior between two agents on the basis of their interpretation of one another's subjectivity. This adjustment is regulated by the agents' respective understanding of social norms and roles, and this regulation produces the regularities described by social science. Recent ethnomethodologists have em- phasized elements of indeterminacy in the social definition of roles and norms and the negotiations, decisions, and management strategies required of agents in actualizing a social relationship.7 To understand social interaction, then, the scientific observer must reconstruct the subjective processes of agents as they perceive situa- tions, conceive social role and norms, interpret one another's actions, and negotiate relationships. Behavior is relegated to the status of a variable sign of subjective processes. Attention is focused on initiatives in the consciousness of the agent. How does consciousness gather up factors widely scatterly in the physical and social environment and give them their particular causal efficacy for behavior? While some phenomenologists profess to practice pure description, it is clear that the concepts I have sketched are no less theoretical than those of the behaviorist. The moment one moves from saying "This is how I am conscious" to "This is consciousness as such " or "This is the subjective meaning of his behavior," he moves into the region of hypothetical reconstruction and theory.8 The widest categories in terms of which the phenomenologist formulates hypotheses about negotiated interaction-- e.g., projection, interpretation, decision, and action- are encountered in the first instance, perhaps, in one's own subjectivity. However, their generalization as categories for the interpretation of the actions of others, as well as the attribution of specific projects, inter- pretations, decisions, and so on, to individual agents, must be validated by the phenomena which they enable the scientist to explain. Further- 7 E.g. Aaron Cicourel, "Basic and Normative Rules in the Negotiation of Status and Role/' Recent Sociology No. 2: Patterns of Communicative Behavior, ed.

Forced Choice In the fields of science many flowers bloom. By ordinary standards, both behaviorism and phenomenological sociology are sciences. Each is pursued by a community of technical investigators, who collect data and elaborate conceptual structures according to consensual paradigms. Each is funded by society in the name of Science. Now, on the crudest level of observation, the two sciences deal with many of the same phenomena. However, they organize data in anti- thetical ways, beginning with such basic concepts as identity, temporal relationship, and causality. In the ordinary sense of "observation," they observe radically different things. It may well be a task for the philosopher to modify the premises of antithetical sciences to reconcile their pictures of the common subject matter. To do so he must stand apart from both. It is impossible for the same person to practice both professionally because he must commit himself to one or the other scientific community and its ways. He must choose between conceptual frameworks to formulate his hypotheses, guide his search for data, and communicate with his coworkers. What then are the grounds for a reasonable choice between behavioristic and phenomenological social science? Values of Behaviorism Skinner appeals to one set of grounds in justifying his program to laymen and another in justifying it to fellow scientists. He threatens the laymen with the destruction of the human species by war, pollu- tion, and over-reproduction if his program of behavioral engineering is not adopted;9 and he holds out the promise that behavioral engineer- ing will provide everyone the Good Life of Waiden Two- minimal tedious labor, full use of one's aptitudes, and health, leisure, and affili- ative relationships.10 I suspect that Skinner's appeal to the layman is designed to win support for the aims of his scientific subcommunity, though no doubt he is genuinely concerned about the danger to our species and the chance for a good life for all. To social scientists Skinner proffers a vision of society as a giant laboratory with the opportunity for comprehensive experimentation * Beyond Freedom and Dignity (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1971), pp. 3-5. i° Waiden Two (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1948), pp. 159-61. H5</page><page sequence="8">and the perfection of behavioral science.11 It is argued against Skinner's program that behavior is unpredictable. Indeed it is, he agrees, as long as individuals are subjected to unknown and conflicting contingencies. A primary advantage of Waiden society is a total control of the en- vironment which permits only predictable behavior to occur. The ultimate goal of Skinner's efforts, as far as I can discern- the goal that determines his choice of concepts and methods- is a grasp of human phenomena under categories and functional equations which allow precise prediction and control. This requires the extinction of capricious behavior by conditioning, diversion of attention from sub- jective processes by precept, and the preservation of the human species by social reform so that there will be a subject matter for behavioral science, as well as behavioral scientists. Skinner is perhaps also inspired by the vision of a "rational" or technocratic society, i.e., one efficient in moving from antecedents to consequences by the most economical routes in a manner aesthetically analogous to inferences in logistic systems and the operations of feedback-controlled computer intelli- gences. Values of Critical Sociology One valuational use to which concepts of phenomenological social science has been put is the critical analysis of alienation. In his early Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, Marx claims that under capitalism the worker is related to the product of his labor as to an alien object . . . the more the worker expends himself in work the more powerful becomes the world of objects which he creates in face of himself, the poorer he becomes in his inner life, and the less he belongs to him- self. . . The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labour becomes an object, assumes an external existence, but that it exists independently, outside himself , and alien to him, and that it stands opposed to him as an autonomous power.12 This "autonomous power" frustrates the fulfillment of the whole man. Man is alienated not only from his products but from his "species essence," his ideally perfected self. Jürgen Habermas' analysis of modes of interaction can be used to 11 See Waiden Two, pp. 292-93; Beyond Freedom and Dignity, Ch. 8; and Cumulative Record, 3rd ed. (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1972), Chaps. 4 and 6. 12 Karl Marx : Early Writings, tr. by T. B. Bottomore (New York: McGraw- Hill, 1963), pp. 122-23. 146</page><page sequence="9">clarify the concept of alienation on a phenomenological basis,13 avoid- ing the anthropomorphism and reification that threatens in references to physical things as "hostile powers." Habermas distinguishes between two orders of rules or social norms. One comprises technical rules based on empirical knowledge of means-ends relationships. Included are rules of behavioral engineering for manipulating human beings in disregard of their subjectivity. In modern technological society, we are taught to identify rational action as action dominated by such rules. To legiti- mize a pattern of behavior, e.g., the management of an assembly line, it is sufficient to demonstrate that the behavior efficiently promotes some limited end, e.g., an increase in productivity or a reduction in absenteeism. The second type of norms effective in ordinary social life are those standards and ways in a shared tradition which allow what Habermas calls "communicative behavior." Communicative behavior can be a basis for concern for the subjective states of another and for genuinely cooperative activities.14 Alienation, according to this analysis, is the domination of human life by technical rules. The mechanism of alienation is not a hyposta- sized "hostile force" residing in nonhuman objects, but the process of socialization. The individual learns to define his situation and role in terms of technical rules. In this he is impelled by subjective motives cultivated in him- again, technically- by other human beings who have internalized the same rules. Both agent and agency of socializa- tion are persuaded to accept the technical life system by an ideology of technocracy and "rationality." Socialization in a technological society, whether the instruments of production be privately or public- ly owned, subordinates human interaction to rules of efficiency with- out regard to the subjective development of either those in authority or those subject to it. According to Habermas, reflection on rules and norms and how we 13 I do not mean to imply that Habermas is a strict phenomenologist or identi- fies himself as one. He does, however, employ concepts in a way which shows its debt to the clarifications of the phenomenologists, and his theories reveal some of the potentialities for value judgments immanent in the phenomenological frame- work. In general there is not space here to do justice to the varieties and complex family relations among types of behaviorism or, especially, types of phenomenolog- ical social science. 14 "Technical Progress and the Social Life World" and "Technology and Science as 'Ideology' " in Toward a Rationed Society (Boston: Beacon Press, 1970) and "Knowledge and Human Interests: A General Perspective," Knowledge and Human Interests (Boston: Beacon Press, 1971), pp. 54-55» 68, and Appendix.

M7</page><page sequence="10">come to act upon them, which is the province of critical social science, has the power to emancipate the individual from technical rules for meaningful existence under freely negotiated social norms.15 A pre- supposition of this claim, I should think, is that it is possible for free minds to negotiate norms which will allow individual fulfillment as well as social interaction. It is a matter of historical fact that the grow- ing reliance on technical rules and the habit of requiring scientific justification for them are destroying man's age-old trust in traditional norms and traditional relations of authority. Habermas appears to be- lieve in the power of moral and social philosophy to provide effective and life fulfilling substitutes. Conditions for Choice I do not mean to suggest by these examples that a particular set of social goals is either a necessary or a sufficient condition for adopting a particular conceptual framework in social science. They only suggest that there is some intimate connection between a man's choice of concepts and the normative uses to which he may anticipate they will be put. They also suggest that the social scientist who, in fealty to the dogma of value neutral science, denies the fact is likely to be either self-deceived or irresponsible. On this occasion I do not have the time to explore in detail the connection between values and conceptual frameworks; but I should like to sketch a position and discuss what it implies for the philosophy of social science. We should distinguish between judgments of merit and judgments of importance in the domain of value judgments. Skinner judges that behavior that endangers the species or frustrates the Good Life is bad. He might, however, have taken perverse delight in destructive be- havior and remained a behaviorist. His judgments of merit are not essential to behaviorism. What is essential is the judgment of import- ance, of behavior over subjectivity. Skinner is impatient at ontological debates about the existence of subjective states. They are simply not important, either to the individual in everyday life, who is directly affected by the behavior of others rather than by their thoughts, or to the scientist, who is interested in correlating observable behavior with observable factors in the environment. A similar point can be made about Habermas' negative judgment respecting alienation. He might have judged that domination of life by technical roles is good rather than bad, as Skinner himself comes close to judging. What puts Habermas' analysis in the phenomeno- 15 "Knowledge and Human Interests," pp. 310 and 314. 148</page><page sequence="11">logical framework is his judgment of the importance of the subjective moment of decision in which the agent applies a negotiated concept of social norms to form a project and initiate a course of action. This is the locus of both what is good and bad in life, for the project is what gives meaning to behavior. It is also the key to scientific explanation of human phenomena. Behavior, on the other hand, is demoted to the status of a consequence and index of subjectivity. Judgments of importance thus are not sufficient to produce judg- ments of merit. Rather, they enable them. Skinner is able to conceive of contemporary society as disrupted by destructive behavior due to negative and uncoordinated reinforcement, and he is able to conceive of a behaviorally engineered alternative, because his judgment of im- portance has directed him to the data and concepts required to form- ulate these options. Habermas is able to judge between the merits of the technical life-order and one of freely negotiated and personality- fulfilling norms because his judgment of importance has directed him to the data and concepts required to formulate these options. Judgments of importance thus appear to be necessary, though not sufficient, conditions for judgments of merit. It is true that there is something like an equivalent of the concept of reinforcement in Haber- mas' system in his notion of power and domination. One might like- wise devise a behavioristic equivalent for the concept of alienation. But I suggest that in both cases one would either have a new concept totally different in intention and significantly different in extension from its "equivalent," or he would have a mongrel behaviorism or a mongrel phenomenology. Judgments of importance enable but do not determine judgments of merit. Now if one is not forced to choose between judgments of im- portance, all would be justified that result, as I have supposed, in a satisfying sense of understanding a wide range of phenomena, each in its own sense of "understanding." However, the individual social scien- tist at this point in history is forced to choose between behaviorism and phenomenology. Hence, he needs additional grounds for justifying his judgment of importance. One ground is the validity of the judg- ments of merit which it enables. If it is possible- -as I believe it to be, though I cannot argue it here- to demonstrate the relative validity of competing judgments of merit by reference to ultimate values for man, then those judgments of importance are best which enable the most valid judgments of merit. Normative Philosophy of Social Science I have not meant to imply that actual scientists do or even ought to M9</page><page sequence="12">have a clear vision of social goals prior to undertaking their work as scientists. At best they may have an obscure sense of social evils that are defined imperfectly in the framework of concepts used by members of some existing intellectual community and perhaps defined different- ly, and likewise imperfectly, by other communities. We should only ask that a man join a community because its work seems relevant to him- the community seems to be dealing effectively with serious prob- lems. Development of final value judgments is as much a consequence of methodical inquiry into human phenomena as effective use of con- cepts and methods to understand phenomena is a consequence of pre- liminary value judgments. Rational inquiry in the concrete is an inter- play between refinement of norms and a deepening penetration into facts. The rational scientist is guided by a provisional and developing con- ception of social goals. Many self-designated "scientists," in contrast, actually practice social science a certain way because they know no alternative, or they trust the authority of a mentor, or that is where jobs, research grants, and publication opportunities are to be found. The logical relation between ends and means in ideal science are often absent in the real world. So much the worse for the real world. It is not the business of philosophy to catalog motivations of those who call themselves scientists. Insofar as philosophy casts its analyses in the personal mode, it depicts the archetypal scientist, the ideal inquirer; and this inquirer is one who espouses personal and social goals which are logically sufficient and psychologically decisive for the adoption of particular concepts and methods. An actual person such as Skinner is valuable as an exemplary case because he admits to goals which, were they valid, would be good reasons for his scientific practice. The pre- tense of other social scientists to value neutrality spoils them as clues to the ideal type. Philosophy of social science is a normative rather than a descriptive enterprise. Otherwise this discussion would be fiction masquerading as history. In point of fact, scientists have seldom faced a clear-cut choice between fully articulated and clearly stated conceptual schemes, with full foresight of the value consequences of each alternative. The actual influence of social goals on social inquiry has been much more indirect, complex, nonlogical, and inadvertent. But it is my notion that it is not the task of philosophy to describe this situation, but to transform it. By tracing the relation of potential means to possible ends and evaluating both, philosophy presents the social scientist with choices where before there could only be intuition, impulse, and groping. Philosophy of social science, then, is normative, since its mission is 150</page><page sequence="13">to assess alternative approaches to the study of man. It presupposes a prior normative inquiry, viz., the comprehensive, critical analysis of social goals. Before we can assess Skinner's concepts and methods, we need to ask, Is Skinner's Good Life good enough for man? Before en- dorsing Habermas' conceptual apparatus, we need to ask, Is his vision of a cooperative and meaningful society of free agents a viable one? This is the foundation. Philosophy of social science proper begins with the analysis of the conceptual structure and factual assumptions used in particular normative social theories. Has behaviorism in fact succeeded in removing all covert reference to subjective occurrencees such as intentions and reasoning? Can human bodily movements be reduced to a manageable number of simple sorts and correlated with environmental events in the complex context of social life? If not, it may be because some of the important social goods and evils we sense in concrete experience escape the net of pure behavioristic concepts. On the other hand, can subjective states be identified and talked about in a determinate way? Can patterns of subjectivity be explainéd, in any coherent sense of "explanation"? Can the study of subjective meanings be scientific, i.e., empirically and consensually controlled, or must phenomenological description remain forever "philosophical"? One's reluctance to accept a negative answer to these questions may reflect value prejudices, e.g., the confused loyalty to freedom and dignity which Skinner decries. To generalize, a philosophy of social science, in seeking a ground for itself, should investigate whether the concepts of particular normative social theories are applicable to human phenomena and whether the phenomena to which they apply are accessible to practicable methods of factual inquiry. Only when these questions have been answered will the philosopher of social science have an adequate basis for the critical evaluation of methods and principles actually used by those who profess to be scientists. Many philosophers plunge into this last task in isolation from social philosophy. Abstaining from the reflection on social goals that might orient their work and removed from the exi- gencies of the subject matter, as philosophers usually are, the philo- sopher is forced to sanctify current practice. This reduces philosophy to what Habermas calls "the pseudo-normative regulation of estab- lished research."16 Or else the philosopher is driven to take as his only guide the example of the physical sciences and indeed a logician's dream of how the physical sciences work. In criticizing this approach to the philosophy of social science, I do 16 Knowledge and Human Interests , p. 4. *5*</page><page sequence="14">not intend to deny that there are general logical criteria for acceptable inquiry, whether it be behavioristic, phenomenological, or whatever. Meanings of concepts must be clear, theories must be articulated as consistent sets of propositions, effective decision procedures must be available for applying terms and disposing of statements, and so on. However, these shared criteria are themselves part of what we have judged to be the good way to handle certain matters of human concern and social interaction, and in any case aherence to such criteria is at most a necessary and not a sufficient condition for doing social science. In closing, I should like to quote a statement of Heidegger: Basic concepts of the sciences determine the way in which we get an understanding beforehand of the area of subject-matter underlying all the objects a science takes as its theme, and all positive investiga- tion is guided by this understanding. Only after the area itself has been explored beforehand in a corresponding manner do these con- cepts become genuinely demonstrated and 'grounded.' . . .Laying the foundations for the sciences in this way is different in principle from the kind of 'logic' which limps along after, investigating the status of some science as it chances to find it, in order to discover its 'method.' Laying the foundations. . . is rather a productive logic- in the sense that it leaps ahead, as it were, into some area of Being, and, after thus arriving at the structures within it, makes these avail- able to the positive sciences as transparent assignments for their inquiry.17 Heidegger makes clear that this "leaping ahead" is not a precipitous thing, nor is it primarily a job for the professional philosopher. Real advances in a science, he notes, require a fullness of time for an "im- manent crisis" to develop in a science, in which "the very relationship between positively investigative inquiry and those things themselves that are under interrogation comes to a point where it begins to totter." Then it is the thinkers immersed in the science, i.e., philosophical scientists, who are most likely to produce a "radical revision" of basic concepts "which is transparent to itself."18 I suggest, however, that professional philosophers, with their traditional concerns, breadth of view, and tools of analysis have an important role to play. I suggest that the social sciences are ripe for dialogue with philosophy. I suggest that one way that philosophy can recover a place of honor for itself in 17 Martin Heidegger, Being and Time , tr. by John Macquarrie and Edward Robingson (New York, Harper, 1962), pp. 30-31; Sein and Zeit , 8th ed. (Tübin- gen: Max Miemeyer Verlag, 1957), p. 10. 18 Being and Time , p. 29; Sein und Zeit , p. 9. 152</page><page sequence="15">the intellectual world is to muster the courage to attempt what Hei- degger calls "productive logics/' though always in patient cooperation with those who undertake the tedious duties of empirical inquiry. I have argued that the laying of foundations for productive logic requires a close examination and critical estimation of the human interests likely to be served by sciences utilizing particular concepts. By rejoining technical analysis of the logic and structure of the social sciences with the serious concerns of normative social philosophy, we may hope to restore the vocation of philosophy to its traditional posi- tion of respected critic of the ways of scientists as well as the ways of mankind. Thus we may hope to escape what threatens to be a historical destiny of gentile irrelevance. *53</page></plain_text>
