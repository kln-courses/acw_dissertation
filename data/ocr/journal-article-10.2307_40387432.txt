These include images of clothed men and women, guns, horses, sheep, wheeled vehicles, houses and ships. Spatial analysis of the structures, artefacts and engravings on the site supports the conclusion that the contact motifs demonstrate continuity in Indigenous modes of representation and innovation in subjects. They provide direct evidence of Aboriginal participation in, and perceptions of, the pastoral and pearl shell industries of the Pilbara. Introduction As part of the Historical Archaeology of the Pilbara Project (HAPP) we recorded the archaeological evidence for some of the earliest European pastoral settlements in the Pilbara (Figure 1). An overview of HAPP, key sites, field methods, and research is provided in Paterson (2006). The archaeology at each station complex typically consisted of the remains of the homestead, associated structures and archaeological deposits. The sites recorded were Inthanoona, Old Woodbrook, Springs, Cooya Pooya, Mount Fisher, Old Sherlock, Andover, Tambrey and Mount Welcome head stations, most of which were long abandoned and thus provided relatively undisturbed archaeological evidence. This paper focuses on the evidence from one pastoral site - Inthanoona. We focus on the site of Inthanoona in this paper for one reason: it has the largest assemblage of historical rock engravings. It is also a site that has a seemingly intact archaeological record of nineteenth century use by pastoralists and Indigenous people, and is thus a good example of one focus for colonisation by pastoralists in addition to the potential information about cross-cultural activities at the site provided by the rock art. The establishment of pastoral stations in the Northwest (1860s onwards) The settler invasion of northwestern Western Australia followed quickly on the heels of the explorations of Francis AP: Archaeology, School of Social and Cultural Studies, University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, 6009.

Gregory; their early station homesteads were nodes of settler activity that formed the colonial 'frontier'. The earliest stations are in three distinct geographical and environmental zones: 1) on the flat coastal Abydos Plain segmented by the Harding, Jones and Sherlock rivers; 2) in the rocky ranges at the edge of the tableland; and 3) on the tableland north of the Chichester Ranges. These sites are part of the coastal toehold that settlers developed after 1864 via Nickol Bay, Cossack and (further north) the De Grey Figure 1. Early pastoral stations recorded in the Historical Archaeology of the Pilbara Project. 99</page><page sequence="2">River to constitute the 'Northwest'. The stations were mainly in Ngarluma country, as well as Jaburrara, Kariyarra, Yindjibarndi and Martuthunira land. All were established as sheep stations, although the presence of horses, cattle, goats and camels in addition is often clear. Most sites of initial settlement considered in this project were abandoned by the end of the nineteenth century and subsumed into larger pastoral holdings. The commitment of settlers began years before the creation of these stations with their decision to colonise the remote Northwest. This was risky business; many settlers were part of the failed attempts by the Victorian Camden Harbour Pastoral Company and the Denison Plains Pastoral Company to settle further north in 1864. These ventures had been expensive in terms of lost lives, stock, capital, and the investments of shareholders. However, many settlers of these earlier colonisation attempts such as C. Broadhurst, E.T. Hooley and A. McRae, fared better in the Northwest. Other early settlers had participated in the exploration team led by Francis Gregory (May to October 1861) who, from a landing in Nickol Bay (near modern Karratha), explored potential grazing land and water sources, and gave European names to the De Grey, Oakover, Sherlock, Fortesque, Maitland, Harding and Ashburton rivers. Gregory collected pearl oysters at Nickol Bay and returned to Perth with a rich cargo of pearlshell; this would eventually lead to the development of the significant pearl shell industry in the region (Gregory and Gregory 2002 [1884]:73). The colonisation effort and colonial industries required labour. Some early settlers, such as John and Emma Withnell, arrived with their families, servants and paid shepherds. Some brought Aboriginal people from the south of the colony. Charles Broadhurst, for example, arrived with Henry, an Aboriginal prisoner from Rottnest Island who would die within the year, while Walter Padbury arrived with a team of ten Europeans and three to five Aboriginal prisoners (Richardson 1914:37). There were to be no convicts allowed in the Northwest, it being considered too remote from the Swan River Colony (Perth). Not surprisingly the early colonists looked towards the Aboriginal population of the region as a potential source of labour at the same time as competition for land and resources was triggered between settlers and indigenous occupants. Initial observation of the archaeological remains at the early pastoral head stations indicates that these sites reflect the different purchases, technologies, innovations and lifeways of the earliest pastoralists, whose chosen settlements were some of the most remote in the colony. Several stations were characterised by well-planned precincts of masonry structures whose construction reveals a high degree of commitment to the establishment and maintenance of the individual ventures. Despite the building of substantial stations, the archaeological record at these stations suggests that most were abandoned by the early twentieth century. A survey of pastoral stations published in 1915 described only some of these founding properties as in use (Old Woodbrook, Cooya 100 Pooya), and reports that by then Inthanoona had 'lost its own identity' (Battye 1985[1915]:221). It is clear that the initial pattern of European settlement did not survive for long, but was transformed, probably by factors that included economic imperatives, environmental impacts and access to better pastoral country further inland. A process of 'landscape learning' had occurred, (cf. Rockman and Steele 2003). Landscape learning involves social, cognitive and environmental responses to unfamiliar landscapes. In our consideration of Inthanoona we are primarily interested in the social and cross-cultural aspects, particularly how Aboriginal people depicted the pastoral domain. Another core aspect of European colonisation was the introduced animals: while most pastoralism in the region began with sheep, over time there was a shift to cattle, which was in part market driven, and possibly a response to degraded pastures after the initial phase of sheep farming. Some pastoralists went broke, possibly being constrained by the small size of their pastoral leases. Other pastoralists tried to diversify, with some becoming involved in the start-up and boom cycle of the pearl shell industry in the 1870s and 1880s. We know from contemporaneous accounts that Aboriginal people were present at pastoral stations across the Pilbara, and that some stations quickly developed a reliance on Aboriginal workers for shepherding, domestic help, cleaning wool, delivering messages and for shearing. Historical accounts of these places are rare, and few touch upon cross-cultural aspects, although some reveal the reliance on Aboriginal labour and refer to conflict between settlers and Aboriginals (Richardson 1914, Bridge 2004). The accounts make clear that Aboriginal people were not only involved in pastoral and domestic work, but that some were involved in the pearling industry when pastoralists came to use Aboriginal divers to collect pearl shell. There are no detailed accounts by indigenous people of these early decades of colonisation, and it is only after a century of change that oral histories are recorded. The rich pearl shell fields of the Dampier Archipelago, were described as being initially dominated by Aboriginal divers. The pearling industry in the early 1870s involved '75 Europeans, who employ about 350 Aboriginal natives . . . (exclusive of women and children who are also fed) and a few Malays' (Weld 1872: 36, cited in De La Rue 1979: 73). Some accounts suggest Aboriginal workers were forcibly detained by pearlers and authorities. Their work with pearlers and pastoralists came under the provisions of the colonial Master and Servant legislation (An Ordinance further to provide summary remedy between Masters and Servants 1868 [32 Vic No 8]) and later amendments. Labour contracts between Aboriginal workers and Europeans allowed for breaches of contract, such as leaving a station, to be punished by imprisonment and hard labour. At least initially, the legal status of work contracts was probably unknown or incomprehensible to Aboriginal workers, but the legislation was enforced with arrests and punishment. That the legislation did have an effect is clear from Donald McRae, who managed Inthanoona's neighbouring station (Old) Woodbrook, when he wrote in the late 1870s that Ί</page><page sequence="3">was very busy getting my darkies together for pearling. I have got a very good crowd this season, nearly forty and would have done good things if it had not been for these new regulations which will throw us back a bit' (D. McRae, Letters MS 287 A, 31/7/1881, State Library of Western Australia). In some instances forced labour was provided through 'blackbirding', as admitted officially in 1882 by colonial Governor Frederick Napier Broome: Some official reports and papers which have recently been before the Governor... to show that the proceedings of the persons who annually visit different parts of the northern districts with the view of obtaining services of the natives as divers in the Pearl Industry, are not in harmony with the laws which have been framed with the object of securing equal freedom of contract to the Aboriginal natives of this colony... in some cases, an unwarrantable degree of moral pressure, and some actual personal restraint has been used to induce or compel natives to leave their homes to engage themselves as divers. (GG, 5/12/1882; CSO, 1502/43 in Ace. 388, 76) Official documents and less verifiable sources suggest that blackbirders were assisted by complacent colonial officials and complicit pastoralists, many of whom were signed up as Justices of the Peace and thus able to witness the workers' contracts (collated in Wright and Stella 2003). The statutes prohibited the employment of 'Any person who shall not have arrived at the age of puberty' (Supplement to the Government Gazette of Western Australia, 7 December 1880), although complaints were made that suggest that some workers were as young as twelve. Legislation attempted to prevent women working on the pearl shell fleet, although they did, as described in 1869 by the Colonial Secretary: 'My attention has been called several times to the fact that females, some of them mere children have been taken from their natural protectors and forced into boats' (CSO, 1969, Vol 646, no. 170, 2/6/1871). Women and children also worked as beachcombers for pearlers. This gives rise to several questions concerning the archaeology of contact across the Pilbara. How did Aboriginal people become involved with the pastoralists and pearlers? On a frontier which was known to be violent in the early phases what evidence is there for violence and mitigation, and for resistance and accommodation between settlers and indigenous peoples? The brief historical excerpts presented here suggest that there was possibly great variation in cross-cultural relationships, and that Aboriginal labour was essential to the settler enterprise. In short, the historical record makes it clear that the colonial world of the Northwest was one that involved interaction between settlers and Aboriginal people, a demand for indigenous work and services, the forced movement of people from the hinterland to the coastal pearling activities, and statutes that provided access to cheap Aboriginal labour with minimal regulation or protection. What then of the archaeological evidence for Aboriginal workers? The presence of Aboriginal people in proximity to the head station sites surveyed is reflected in the assemblages of stone and glass flaked artefacts, and at several sites the presence of Aboriginal people is strikingly reflected in engraved images. While further research and analysis is required to explore the meaning of this evidence, the consideration here of the archaeological record from Inthanoona will allow some observations to be offered. Inthanoona Station The remains of Inthanoona Station are located on an east- west stretch of the Jones River, 30 km from the coast and 70 km southeast of Cossack, on the northern margins of the rocky ranges that separate the coastal plain from the tableland to the south. The area is an undulating plain interspersed with spectacular bare stone outcrops rising up to 20 metres. The immediate basis for the choice of the site as the head station is Inthanuna Pool, an impressive 700 metre long waterhole in the Jones River. The station complex is sited at the western end of the waterhole, bisected by the line of the river and dominated by a group of stone outcrops on its south-eastern margin. Most of the stone engravings on the site are located on these outcrops. In the nineteenth century, pastoralists at Inthanoona were close to other early pastoral stations. Their nearest neighbour was Old Woodbrook Station, 10 km to the west, upstream on the Jones River. Pyramid Station is 12 km to the south-east and Mount Fisher homestead is 12 km to the north-east. Samuel Henry Viveash's recollections of Inthanoona, detailed in 1912 (Battye 1985[1912] volume 2:169-170), encompass both the pastoral and pearling industries. Inthanoona was established in November 1864 by Messrs Viveash, Wilkinson and Middleton with three hundred sheep and three horses; from this a flock of 10,000 sheep developed. Viveash retained the station until 1889, after which its use is less clear, becoming subsumed into Tambrey station by 1915 (Battye 1985[1915]: 221). Battye, presumably having interviewed Viveash, states that 'In pleasant contrast to the experience of many of the early settlers, Mr Viveash has little or no troubles with the natives, who always displayed a friendly spirit, and he frankly declares his indebtedness to them in their assistance in the station work, ascribing a large share of the success of his operations to the efficient aid rendered by them.' According to Battye and the biography of Pilbara resident Charles Harper (Mercer 1958: 35), Inthanoona, despite being located well inland, was significant in the development of the pearl shell industry in the 1860s or 1870s: ... in conjunction with Mr Harper . . . [Mr Viveash] built a boat and engaged in the pearling industry for three seasons, this firm being the first in the north-west to employ Aboriginal divers for obtaining the pearl shell. The vessel was called the Amateur ... The seventeen natives employed in the summer on the pearling-fields were, in the winter, equally invaluable on the station shearing-shed and in handling the sheep, which were rapidly increasing in numbers (Battye 1985[1912], volume 2: 170) 101</page><page sequence="4">Inthanoona has the richest assemblage of engravings of any of the sites recorded by HAPR It had been previously reported by Robert Reynolds as a site of engravings with contact subjects, notably with several depictions of ships (Reynolds 1987). Our examination revealed that in addition to traditional subjects the assemblage included images of clothed men and women, guns, horses, sheep, wheeled vehicles and houses as well as ships. The combination of these images and the association of the site with the early phases of both the pastoral and pearling industries appeared to provide considerable potential for analysis. Among the questions we set out to explore were: can the distribution of engravings on the site provide evidence for the circumstances under which they were engraved; and can the subjects of the engravings provide evidence for the date of their creation and the interests or preoccupations of their creators? In order to address these questions it was clear that we had to record, as far as possible, the location in relation to the head station and subject of all the engravings. Methodology The Pilbara Project used a variety of survey and recording techniques, depending on the circumstances and scale of the sites being studied. Given its broad research aims and the fact that many of these sites were being investigated for the first time, our aim was to record all components of a site, however superficially, in an attempt to characterise the site as a whole. This facilitates intersite comparison within the current regional survey program, and allows later research to investigate specific issues. The archaeology of pastoral sites requires a landscape approach and the use of a range of information. This may include archaeological information from one or more related sites, the evidence from pre-contact and historical archaeological contexts, documentary sources, and oral histories of past residents and observers. This approach developed in this project builds on a suite of archaeological studies of pastoral contexts from the Kimberley (Smith 2000; Harrison 2004b; Head and Fullagar 1997), New South Wales (Harrison 2004a), Central Australia (Paterson 2005, 2007), and of historical sites generally (Byrne and Nugent 2004). A range of possible cultural outcomes require testing from an archaeological perspective, especially given the sometimes poor documentary accounts of these places, and the great extent of change that pastoralism heralded within some of these societies. Put simply, people became enveloped in the pastoral domain, or were excluded; however there was often the movement of people in and out of the pastoral domain (Head and Fullagar 1999), and in some cases, such as walk-off camps, sites became places of protest (Paterson et al 2003). The use of a broad range of archaeological evidence in studies of cross-cultural aspects of pastoral stations is preferred to one that focuses on one mode of investigation 102 for a quick insight based on what are perceived to be 'better' forms of evidence, such as the presence of Aboriginal modified glass artefacts. Reliance on one form of evidence is clearly problematic, as its absence can potentially be viewed as evidence for a 'lesser' degree of intensity of contact. In this regard, the limitations of focussing on contact 'markers' is comparable to the problems in determining ethnicity by relying only on ethnic markers. Thankfully the archaeology of culture contact - and ethnicities - has seen much research activity of recent years and has moved to more nuanced understandings of the material record of culture contact. That said certain items such as flaked glass remain significant prima facie evidence for Indigenous use of new materials. We found evidence for Aboriginal presence on the head station sites in the spatial structure of the archaeological evidence, assemblage content, use of new materials, and rock engravings. The methodology was therefore designed to capture all these forms of evidence. Site survey Prior to fieldwork the homestead sites were identified from historical research and from consultation with local informants. The sites were found by aerial survey after which they were visited and access routes and precise locations were recorded with GPS. The survey of the early pastoral stations required a methodology that would provide locations for these remote sites, generate maps of sites and their topographic context, and give precise planning of archaeological feature locations within sites to interpret cross-cultural aspects of the site. All of these requirements were met by a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), where a fixed base station records correction data while mobile GPS receivers (rovers) were used on site. The two data sets are later brought together and the rover data corrected to provide sub-metre accuracy. Although a radio broadcast Real Time Correction signal was available from Port Hedland, it was considered more reliable to use a portable GPS base station on site. A Trimble ProXR backpack receiver, powered from a car battery, was set up at high point on each site and its average recorded position used to generate a reference location. A Trimble GeoXT handheld receiver was used as the rover unit to record the position of structures and other recorded features and to define the topographic character of the site, providing context for later analysis. The receiver uses Asset Surveyor software which was used to construct a data dictionary, essentially a database to structure descriptions of recorded features. While complex features were recorded on pro-forma recording sheets many site features such as fence lines and posts could be fully recorded within the GPS. Differential correction of the GPS data was carried out using Trimble Pathfinder Office software at the end of each day so that any problems could be checked and corrected as work proceeded. The corrected data was imported into an</page><page sequence="5">overall GIS framework built up in ESRI ArcGIS, and primarily using 1:250,000 vector map data available from GeoScience Australia and Geocover LandSat imagery from NASA. Site feature recording The archaeological material on the head station complex consisted largely of structural remains and surface scatters of European artefacts and stone artefacts, as well as engravings, all of which were suited to non-intrusive recording techniques. The method used was based on that initially developed by the Central Australia Archaeology Project (Birmingham 1997), and refined in subsequent field work (Pater son 2005). Each component of the site was termed a feature and classified using predetermined categories. Structural components were classified as regular or non-regular, while artefact concentrations were classified as single artefact, cluster, scatter, general cover, heap or fill depending on their size and depositional character. Recording began with an extensive pedestrian survey conducted to define the limits of the site. As site features were recognised, each was labelled with a numbered survey flag. The feature number thus assigned became the key identifier of the feature in all records from plans to photographs to the GIS database. All features were recorded using a standard pro-forma sheet which provided for description, plan and quantitative contents data. Structures and artefact concentrations were described and planned using a standard compass orientation. Each feature plan included the feature point which tied the drawn plan into the overall site survey. These two data sets in combination provided a complete spatial record of the sites. The contents of the artefact concentration features were recorded in tabular form for a set of predefined variables. These recorded the frequency of artefacts of various types as well as different colours of glass, bottle base and lip forms, and modified (flaked) glass. Where artefacts were too numerous to easily count, recorded samples were counted and used in combination with the total area of the feature, derived from the plan, to produce a total frequency estimate. The location of sample squares was selected to represent the content and density of the feature. Where features varied in density additional samples were recorded. These tabular data provided a complete quantitative estimate of artefacts on the site. Selected significant objects which showed evidence of reuse or had marks and inscriptions useful for dating were recorded in digital photographs that included the feature number. This qualitative record provided dating information and supports the study of use, distribution and modification of particular groups of artefacts. Following fieldwork the recording sheets were scanned and georegistered within the GIS using the feature point marked on the plan and the corresponding point in the corrected GPS record. Features were then digitised (traced) in the GIS and the recorded attributes, such as structure height and artefact frequencies, were attached to build up an integrated record of the whole site. Rock engraving recording As on other sites in the project, engravings were recorded by digital photography and assigned either individually or as a group to a numbered feature location in accordance with our standard methods. In the case of Inthanoona, our initial inspection of the site revealed more than 200 engraved motifs concentrated in one part of the site and including a high proportion of contact-era subjects. The size of the assemblage was beyond anything we had encountered on other sites and would clearly be difficult to record within the time allocated for the site. However, the potential significance of the assemblage and its ability to contribute to the research aims of the project meant that it was imperative that we record the subject and location of each engraving. To achieve this within the limited time available we used a combination of the DGPS and the digital camera to assign a location to each digital image based on the time records kept by both. This technique had been used in ultra-light aerial survey as part of the Greater Angkor Project and utilised software, called GeoTagger, being developed by the Sydney University Archaeological Computing Laboratory. As any GPS receiver records its location each second and a digital camera timestamps each exposure, it is theoretically simple to join the two record sets and link each image to a location. However, there are practical difficulties, including the synchronisation of the camera clock with the GPS, failure to link without exact time matching and accessing the image timestamp which is stored in the EXIF header of the digital image. The GeoTagger software is designed to deal with these issues. Precise synchronisation is difficult, but there is a simple solution; at the start of survey the time display on the GPS is photographed, thus recording any offset between the two records. The offset is later specified in GeoTagger. A tolerance setting can also be entered so that if no exact time match exists a nearby time can be used. This is especially useful if there are gaps in the GPS record caused by signal loss. GeoTagger then writes the coordinates into the EXIF header of each image. After initial scouting and marking of the site we were able, using this technique, to record the whole engraving assemblage in three hours. We used two people, one with the digital camera and one with the GPS unit, in what was difficult, steep terrain. To give some idea of the roughness of the terrain, the horizontal distance covered was 2.5 km, while our total walked distance was 3.5 km. The digital photographs were then used as the basis for the analysis of the engraving corpus. Given the difficulties of interpreting rock engravings from photographs, the motifs were photographed at two different times under different lighting conditions. At this stage the primary focus of the analysis has been the identification of motifs that are unambiguously from the pastoral era. Our approach is simple: motifs were classified as 'contact' and 'everything else'. Potentially ambiguous motifs, such as crescent or 'horseshoe' motifs, were not classified as contact, even though at Old Woodbrook Station we recorded a group of 103</page><page sequence="6">crescents running in sequence, and looking like horseshoe tracks. Discussion Site organisation, structures and artefacts The Inthanoona head station complex straddles the Jones River which divides the homestead precinct to the north from the pastoral working area to the south (Figures 2 and 3). The northern part of the head station complex includes the remains of seven major structures interpreted as a stone- paved two-roomed homestead and separate kitchen with paved veranda, store rooms, workers' quarters, a smithy, a large shed/store and other structures. These were strung out along a track parallel to the river and enclosed by post and wire fences, now largely removed. Almost 100 metres to the west of the kitchen there was a stone well on the flank of the river, which presumably assured an unpolluted water supply, even in dry times. This tentative interpretation of the function of these buildings is based on observation of their form and the artefact assemblages surrounding them, and will be subject to further analysis. Each of the structures is surrounded by a concentration of artefacts, with a particularly rich assemblage down-slope to the south of the homestead and kitchen. The shallow gully to the north of the track contains a large scatter of artefacts not associated with any particular structure. Other isolated concentrations may be related to activity areas where no structure existed or where no visible remains survive. On the southern side of the river are the remains of distinctive curved stone-built double stockyards, enclosing an area of more than 1500 square metres. On the northern side of these yards a substantial 25 metre long rectangular stone structure, presumably a shearing shed, had been added. The surviving walls of this building are up to three metres high and it was at least partially paved with stone. The analysis of the artefact assemblage provides data that assist with the dating and interpretation of the site (Figure 3). More than 3500 artefacts were recorded during the survey, when the samples are adjusted for total area the estimated artefact count is more than 45,000. As expected on a nineteenth century pastoral site, more than half of the artefacts are glass. The overall distribution of artefacts clearly reflects the functional division of the site, with more than ninety percent of the assemblage concentrated in the homestead precinct north of the river. This includes almost all of the ceramics and half the glass, supporting the view that this was the focus of domestic activity on the site. While most of the identified worked glass was in artefact scatters near the homestead, three quarters of the lithics were around the stockyards The predominance of dark olive glass (60%) provides archaeological evidence of the settlement's early date while the absence of twentieth century glass and machine-made nails supports Battye's implication of early twentieth century abandonment. The engravings on the site depict 104 people shooting, smoking and riding. Additional archaeo- logical evidence for these activities - a cartridge and a pistol barrel, clay pipes and horseshoe nails - is concentrated in the homestead precinct. The southern part of the site is characterised by far fewer artefacts: there were scatters of material in and around the yards, with the main concentration between the yards, the waterhole and rocky outcrop to the east. This area had no structural remains and was interpreted as a campsite for workers, including Aboriginal people, a view supported by the presence of flaked stone and glass. This seems to reflect descriptions of the social organisation of stations elsewhere in Australia: where there was often a camp for Aboriginal workers and their kin (Harrison 2004a, 2004b; Paterson 2007). Rock engravings There were a total of 263 motifs recorded at Inthanoona, of which 55 are demonstrably contact. Seventy images were non-figurative, while 32 were classified as 'undetermined', these normally being worn and faint engravings. Two anthropomorphs were engraved onto the door sill of a two- roomed stone building within the head station complex, and are thus pastoral in context, but not in subject according to our classification. All themed motifs are shown in Table 1. Three broad categories of motif classes were recognised in the field: anthropomorphs, animals, and other. Each category was further divided into contact and non-contact (Table 1). Most of the contact anthropomorphs were seemingly of males, but with one clearly female depicted in a full length dress (Figure 4). Most commonly these figures were depicted on horses, often equipped with a rifle or revolver, and sometimes shooting (Figure 5). In one case a riderless horse is depicted with an discharge from the mouth (condensation? saliva? blood?) and surrounded by three firearms - apparently muzzle-loading flintlock muskets, which were being superseded by rifles in the 1860s - all depicted as firing as suggested by muzzle emissions. This separation of guns from these figures was rare: to generalise, the typical contact image at Inthanoona of anthropomorphs tend to be dressed figures, on horses, with guns, wearing hats, and often smoking a pipe. Animal motifs are exclusively of pastoral animals, the most common being horses/donkey. Only five other quadruped motifs were identified, as either sheep or goats, and in two cases are shown as being mustered by a horse and rider. Historical animals are depicted as being ridden or tethered: in one case a horse/donkey pulls a riderless two- wheeled vehicle. Cattle and camels are not depicted. The other distinctive images are of huts, clay pipes (always in the mouths of anthropomorphs, although at other stations they exist in isolation), shoes/boots (sometimes not being worn), guns (all carried, expect the three described above), and seven depictions of boats (Figure 6). Two inscriptions were found. One is three sets of initials on one panel: these are either 'E.V.' or 'F.V.', 'W.H.C. ' and either 4C.M' or 'G.M.'.

While none clearly match the initials, family members or Indigenous people adopting the pastoralists' surnames may account for them. There is also the letter A engraved on the smithy wall. Most Pilbara Project sites included written inscriptions which, unlike most pecked engravings in this region, tend to be incised 106 Figure 4.

It appears that only writing was executed with metal tools. The engravings are located on boulders on the slopes of the four-peaked rock outcrop which defines the southeastern extent of the site (Figure 7). They are confined to the north and western sides of the outcrop overlooking the Jones River, although equally suitable surfaces were available on the other sides. The engravings are distributed along a frontage of 460 metres, and occupy the full slope from base to summit. Rock engraving in the Pilbara region is an ancient tradition (Wright 1968) that encompasses figurative, geometric and more abstract images. The majority of engravings at Inthanoona fall within this tradition. In the absence of absolute dating we are aware that they may all have been created in the pastoral era, but given that many images are weathered there seems no reason not to assume that the engraving assemblage has been built up over a long period, which includes the pastoral era beginning in the 1 860s. Several points lead us to interpret the contact motifs as a continuation of an existing engraving tradition. As a subset of the total assemblage the contact motifs have a different and more limited distribution, being concentrated within less than half (220 metres) of the engraved outcrop</page><page sequence="9">Figure 5.

Additionally, while the total assemblage faces the Jones River the contact motif subset is focused on the pastoral station, being located closer to - and thus often clearly within sight and hearing of - the head station. Finally, this limited distribution of contact motifs applies 108 equally to all three motif categories of anthropomorphs, animals and other motifs. While this in part reflects relationships across our arbitrary categories, such as horse with rider, it independently verifies this focused distribution pattern where people, horses, pastoral paraphernalia and also ships are depicted in association with the head station. Conclusions In this paper we discuss only the headstation at Inthanoona, one of several stations recorded in the Pilbara Project. While further study will situate Inthanoona in its regional context and support a more informed intrasite analysis, we are able to offer conclusions concerning our methods and approach, and our interpretation of the site and the engravings. The approach adopted in the project was refined at Inthanoona in response to the significant engraved assemblage; however, the engravings are only one component of the archaeological evidence at this site. Archaeological features were recorded using paper records, quantitative sampling of surface deposits, digital image recording and DGPS survey. The location of engravings was recorded by linking DGPS and digital image records through timestamping, a field technique which seems to have promise future field recording suitable for GIS. We are aware of the limitation caused by focusing our survey on the homestead sites. The archaeology of cross- cultural interaction on pastoral stations requires a landscape approach that takes into account what happens 'beyond the homestead fence' (see Harrison 2004a, 2004b; Smith 2000; Head and Fullagar 1999). This is because pastoral stations can be the setting for many activities that occur across the landscape and are reflected in archaeological and environmental records, such as changing relationships between different cultures, as well as between settlers and environments, and animals and ecosystems. They are places for resource use and manipulation, and change due to developments in pastoral infrastructure (such as fencing, provision of water, power supply, transport, technology and communication). A fully developed landscape approach thus requires recording the remains of outstations and pastoral infrastructure and environmental change in addition to head stations which were the focus of this initial study. That said, pastoral head stations can be rewarding sites. The homestead is often the focus for many activities, and in many instances the central place on the station for both indigenous and European residency. The distribution of archaeological material is not even across the station but focused at certain locales for pragmatic social and environmental reasons. In terms of dating, both the material culture and the engravings are consistent with the historically defined occupation period of 1864 to 1915. There is no evidence of significant use of the site after abandonment. While the historical evidence for use after the early twentieth century is absent, the archaeological record provides evidence that new material was not introduced to the site, and that new</page><page sequence="11">contemporary motifs were not added to the engraved assemblage. The balance of evidence is focused towards the initial pastoral phase (1860s to 1880s) rather than twentieth century use. This is true of the artefactual evidence and the motifs with the engravings of muskets and pearling ships. The organisation of the working, social and represen- tational aspects of the station domain are clearly documented by the archaeological evidence. The station was established with a clear distinction between homestead precinct and the pastoral working area. This separation of livestock tending areas from the pastoral head station was observed at all sites to some degree. However, Inthanoona was bisected by the Jones River, a major visual and physical barrier which would have become impassable during seasonal floods. The decision to situate the station astride this formidable barrier inevitably had a major impact, given that all movement between the pastoral working area and the headstation required negotiating the stony uneven river bed, flood detritus and thick vegetation. We suspect that impetus for the yard location was the use of natural features, such as the river and steep slopes, to enclose grazing areas. The archaeological survey revealed that not only was the station designed this way, but that this segmentation structured the use of the station throughout its life. The artefacts reveal that the station remained divided, with almost all the evidence for domestic activities focused on the homestead, while a very different pattern exists for the yards. Analysis of the engravings reveals that the contact depictions focus on the pastoral station. The engravings, largely limited to boulders on the elevated outcrop, overlook a landscape which changed significantly with the arrival of the pastoralists in the 1860s. In contrast to any person at the head station or the yards, the engravers had a view which encompassed both the northern and southern segments of the station (Figure 4). We read the engravings as evidence for the indigenous response to the establishment of the pastoral station: where selected aspects of the pastoral domain are represented, and where these representations are focused at the pastoral head station. The GIS permits us to conclude whether some activities were isolated or hidden. The evidence reveals that most activities occurred close to the head station. For example, engravings - as far is revealed by contact motifs - are close to the station, as are camping areas, and glass working areas. There are no clear 'hidden areas' for the creation of contact- era figurative graphics. There are some small rock shelters and stone alignments out of site of the head station, but these are not clearly associated with contact material or images, so we cannot say when they were used. The rock art at Inthanoona strongly suggests continuity of practice in engraving. We interpret the contact motifs as relying on existing technique to represent the pastoral domain at an existing engraving site. Additionally, the production of traditional indigenous motifs - such as emus or anthropomorphs - may have continued. Both of these assumptions can only be tested with absolute dating or evidence for superimposition, of which there is little. In addition, the contact era at Inthanoona and other sites strongly suggests Europeans practiced rock engraving, most commonly to render names and dates. Obviously it is impossible to absolutely identify authorship of these images, and we propose here that both Aborigines and Europeans engraved stone in the pastoral era. In the absence of a thorough technical examination of engraving technique in conjunction with a statistical analysis of motifs it is difficult to pursue this question. In order to understand the nature and distribution of the engraved assemblage we have isolated the contact motifs. As argued elsewhere (Clarke 1994, Frederick 1999) a focus on the contact images risks an over-emphasis on introduced aspects of the art corpus, while missing out on the complexity of the cross-cultural exchange. We are aware of this issue, but feel our approach supports an analysis of the contact images within the context of the complete corpus at Inthanoona. We note that every station in the project with suitable rock surfaces nearby has engravings. Most have contact imagery but nowhere as much as at Inthanoona. By recording all engravings we hope to better understand these depictions of the colonial world through a more nuanced analysis of the rock art assemblages at these places. It is significant that in a pastoral landscape numerically dominated by sheep it is horses and some selected elements of the pastoral domain that are depicted most frequently. As depicted, animals were not separate from other aspects of the pastoral realm, such as settlers, new material culture and new behaviour. Many of these things are recorded in the engravings, however horses seem particularly important. Could it be that they represent work and power? Is it that they are central to indigenous interactions with pastoralists? Horses are rarely depicted alone: they have riders who are clothed, wear hats and smoke pipes. Are the riders European or Aboriginal? It is simplistic to assume they are all white: Aboriginal workers may well be depicted as indistinguishable from other workers. Maybe this is a matter of convention; to depict a pastoralist 'properly' may require clay pipe, a hat and boots and the classic hand-on-hips stance. The indigenous decision to depict riders and horses in pastoral contexts warrants further study as it provides an evidence of indigenous preoccupations in periods of great transformation. Other studies of Aboriginal participation in pastoral industries demonstrate the significance of horses to pastoral participants, both Aboriginal and European. Another distinctive aspect of the Inthanoona assemblage is the repeated depiction of ships suggesting that here, one of the starting points of the pearling industry, Aboriginal people had a particular interest in pearling vessels and the work around them. Indeed, some images reveal intimate knowledge of the vessels, their use and pearling activities. Like the horses, the boat images are often depicted with people. At least three of the images may depict the SS Xantho, a steamship active in Western Australia in 1872 and employed on the pearl shell fields off the Pilbara coast. No European depictions of the vessel are known. However, it has been excavated by maritime archaeologists and the distinctive arrangement of single funnel and masts strongly 109</page><page sequence="12">suggests that the artists were familiar with this vessel (McCarthy 2000). Are any of the engravings of the Amateur! Surely this vessel too was known to Aboriginal workers at Inthanoona, yet it is not depicted - there is no engraving showing a single masted vessel. The depiction of ships in rock art potentially reveals levels of indigenous knowledge and the structure of culture contact. Clarke and Frederick (2006) consider the different boats depicted on Groóte Eylandt and describe how Macassan praus and their crew were highly detailed, showing not only their construction but their crew. European boats are executed with less detail and tend to not depict the crews. In the Sydney region the boats are depicted well away from initial points of contact and with very little technical detail suggesting little indigenous familiarity with the vessels (McDonald 2008). At Inthanoona some vessels are depicted in great detail suggesting personal familiarity with specific vessels and probably work on them. Other vessels are ruder in detail and may not communicate fine detail about boats but some other message to the viewer. The production of these engravings exists within the broader structure of indigenous responses to the arrival of European settlers. As several HAPP pastoral sites have engravings it will be possible to study indigenous and settler graphic production within the overall context of material culture on the colonial frontier of the Northwest. What this analysis demonstrates is that the engravings at Inthanoona, however difficult to read, document indigenous reactions to, and perceptions of, the pastoral domain. Inthanoona provides exceptional evidence for the establishment of the important early colonial pastoral and pearling industries. It would be simplistic to accept at face value Battye's report of Viveash's claim that Inthanoona was more successful than other Northwest stations in terms of inter-cultural relationships. To test this claim and to realise the full potential of the site in a regional context requires further analysis. We are reminded by Frederick that '... contact rock art does not merely reflect a series of historical events and the imposition of foreign forces, rather it represents a more complex exchange involving losses and gains' (Frederick 1999:132). It is our contention that the engravings at Inthanoona, supported by an analysis of the whole range of archaeological evidence from the site, demonstrate this is true and that that they have the potential to provide us with direct evidence of Indigenous perceptions of contact.
