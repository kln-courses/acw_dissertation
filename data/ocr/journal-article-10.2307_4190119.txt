SWETZ Newbry and Martin in their article on the educational crisis facing developing nations have reviewed some of the difficulties and dilemmas encountered by educators of these countries in their attempts to produce viable educational systems consistent with national priorities.' Their com- ments, punctuated with the insights of experience, advocate a break with traditional institutionalism and suggest a reevaluation of educational goals and processes in conformity with the existing socioeconomic status of the developing nation. While they have raised decisive questions pertinent to this theme, the questions and their answers remain moot. The object of this comment is to reconsider some of Newbry and Martin's issues concern- ing the general problems of educational revision in developing nations from the perspective of cultural and social as well as economic significance. The present experience of Tanzania and the People's Republic of China will be discussed as an affirmation of the existence of workable educational alternatives. Our authors leave us with the thought that "there must be a willingness to break from tradition."2 Whose tradition-indigenous convention evolved from the society itself or the tradition imposed by a colonial or neocolonial subjection? While the second option almost implies a contradiction, edu- cationally speaking, it is where our answer lies. Educational philosophies and systems employed in developing nations are based on Western exem- plars and as such are culturally, socially, and perhaps even academically alien to their host societies.3 Western education rests on an authoritarian, Assistant Professor of Mathematics and Education, the Capitol Campus of Pennsylvania State University at Middletown; formerly with the Peace Corps in Malaysia (1964-67); author of Alathematics Education in China (M.I.T.

Swetz competitive, and egocentric rather than societalcentric approach to learning and in most respects is removed from the mundane necessity of immediate vocational applicability. While affirnming John Dewey's precept asserting primacy of individual development, this educational approach obscures the fact that the path of this development is defined within and influenced by a social context. In the West, this context has been determined by the Judeo-Christian belief attesting that the individual in counsel with a per- sonal, anthropomorphic god is the master of his fate. The experiences of the industrial revolution further intensified this individuality by singling out a person as a unit of production thereby adding an economic dimension to the existing accepted spiritual individualism of a being. Developing nations lack such a legacy. Agricultural survival in Latin America, Africa, and Asia still requires the collective efforts of extended family and village. It would appear that until the level of agricultural output of the developing world increases enotugh to sustain indtustrial advancement, educational philosophies should be reformulated to encourage a cooperative spirit, one in accord with the necessity of existing social interactions and conducive to the early stages of nation building. What factors prescribe the duration of general schooling for a nation's young? Is it an amount of knowledge to which they muist be exposed in order to become "uiseftul" citizens, or is it a predetermined clhronological age and the nature of the social tasks eventually expected of them that do in truth dictate the desired length of their schooling? After what period of time does education cease to be a national investment and become a form of parasitic consumption? Considering the economic burden imnposed on national budgets by educational demands, these questions uirgently need answers. Present patterns of school attendance in Africa vary widely: 6 years terminating at 12 or 14 years of age; 8 years terminating at age 14 or 16, and 7 years ending at a chronological age of 12 or 13, but all were adopted from European standards withotut duie regard for cultural or social implications.4 By necessity youth in a traditional society assume higher degrees of responsibility mtuch sooner than their Western counterparts. It is not unusual in Asia for children as young as four to mind their younger siblings or in East Africa for Masai boys who have not yet reached puberty to be self-sufficient enough to tend large herds of cattle, while in New York City a mother may have difficulty obtaining a "baby-sitter" for her adolescent child. The level of personal responsibility (or lack thereof) in each situation is contingent upon cultural expectations. A Western youth may choose to attend school until he is well into his twenties because he has little else to do. His society neither expects nor requires more of him.5 In contrast, a child in a developing nation achieves full productive potential upon entering early adolescence. As a result of this phenomenon, cultural demands combined with financial difficulties often prevent able students from completing their studies, thus contributing to the large amount of education "wastage" experienced in developing areas of the 'P.

Coleman, "How Do the Young Become Adults," Phi Delta Kappan 54 (December 1972): 226-31.</page><page sequence="3">Educational Crisis in Developing Nations 175 world." Modification of existing education timetables to accommodate social expectations could remedy this situation. Far more tragic and socially dangerous than the wastage of the school dropout is the nonutilization of the graduate who, upon terminating his formal education, cannot find a place of employment and is reduced to the status of "applicant."7 Several years ago, while traveling through the back- country along the Congo-Uganda border, I received a ride with a gang of bootleggers who were peddling a potent brew of banana beer. In my con- versation with the articulate and knowledgeable young man driving the truck, I discovered that he had passed his Cambridge H.S.C. examinations but, unable to win university acceptance or a position in the city, became a bootlegger.8 He was fortunate that despite his experiences of "applicant- ship" he could readjust, albeit with some difficulty, to village life. But what of his fellow school-leavers who could neither find a position in the city nor return to their village? For them, years of personal and collective family sacrifice have resulted in frustration and alienation, a psychological state that combined with the newly acquired ideals of Western enlighten- ment could vent itself in radical political activity. Educational output, while accommodating aspired manpower goals, must also attempt to conform to contemporary job markets. Curricula and in- structional orientation should develop realistic vocational attitudes in children. A survey by E. L. Klingelhofer of the University of East Africa on the occupational preferences of Tanzanian secondary school pupils revealed wide discrepancies between student expectations and their society's requirements.9 Forty-nine percent of the population sampled aspired to engineering professions while national needs could support only 1.3 percent; similarly 38.8 percent wanted to become medical doctors despite a projected need of 1.2 percent. Student attraction to other pro- fessions on the upper level of Western social desirability and possible local utilization was equally disproportionate. The same survey attested to the impact of radio upon the developing world-12.5 percent of the students wished to become radio announcers. Unfortunately manpower quotas for this profession were 0.1 percent. Similar survey results from the West Coast of Africa were equally alarming.'0 Perhaps the impact of such studies may be lessened by dispelling some opinions as adolescent fancies, but what of the many students who are sincere in their vocational objectives? One 6 Educational wastage in the context of national development is a phrase applied to the school dropout population. It is a topic of frequent concern; for example, see S. Collins, "Social and Economic Causes of Wastage in Schools and Other Institutions in Tanganyika," Teacher Education in New Countries 5 (May 1964): 40-50, and S. H. Irvine, "Education for Africans in an Industrial Society: The Aspect of Wastage in Formal Education," Teacher Education in New Countries 2 (February 1961) ): 43-57. 7 One who has filed many job applications and waits for long periods of time for affirmative action.

Swetz such case concems an East African who received a Columbo Plan scholar- ship for studying civil engineering in Canada."' The young man excelled in his work, completing a doctorate with specialization in tunneling engi- neering. His country had no need of tunnel engineers, so he was lent to the Canadian government as a token of reverse technical assistance. Curricula designs should concisely depict nationial priorities within the constraints of the developmental state. It would seem that the four areas of academic concern most conducive to nation building would be (1) the promotion of a basic literacy, (2) the instilling of a national identity, (3) the advancement of a spirit of scientism, and (4) the nurtturing of a respect for productive physical labor. Basic literacy must provide for competency in the national language and center around indigenous literature with a scope broad enough to allow for political awareness and the possibility of continuing self-education. While Western nations have endeavored to use eduication to instill a national consciousness in their youlth, the task is far more urgent in developing nations where inherited traditions do not support the recently imported concept of the nation. Initial exposure to the responsibilities and benefits of citizenship will have to lie within tlle con- fines of the classroom. Civics courses must cater to this need by fostering a spirit of public service in which the necessity for a cooperative nation- building effort is fully acknowledged. Educational policies that include racial, religious, or tribal quotas contradict the ideal of social integrity and cast doubt on existing expressions of national unity. Perhaps the most vital aspect of Western education re(uiring emulation, and yet the most elusive to achieve, is that of imparting a scientific woild outlook to the youth of developing nations. Basic conceptions of science could free populations from the bondage of superstition and disease and provide a foundation upon which industrialization can proceed. Western science and mathematics curricula, although they seem the most peda- gogically attractive and technically sound, have questionable efficacy in societies emerging from a traditional past.12 Whereas the deductively conceived science of Western man transcends the limitations of sense per- ception to systemize the universe, traditional man unfamiliar with the processes of formalization bases his "scientific" theories solely on concrete experience. Deprived of a Galilean heritage, non-Western man inductively qualifies his environment, thus his inherent approach to scientific thinking diverges from Western models.'3 The formalistic nature of Western science and mathematics curricula requires sophisticated verbal and symbolic language which makes its adaptation difficult into societies undergoing modification of traditional languages. American students and teachers labor, often in confusion, with the semantic and notational requirements of the SMSG inspired "new math."'4 Imagine how this perplexity is magni- 1- The Columbo Plan is a technical assistance program within the Britislh Comnmoln- wealth countries. 12 For a discussion of this topic, see Guy Hunter, Modernizing Peasant Societies: A Comparative Study in Asia and Africa (New York: Oxford University Press, 1969). 3 This is an area of needed investigation; see L.

It assisted in supplying a reserve of prepared manpower to fill the demands of awaiting industrial economies. Education in its academic channel produced candidates for the bureau- cratic and managerial hierarchy while formal vocational training assured a supply of skilled technicians and craftsmen. Developing areas of the world still rely on an agricultural base, and their populations are primarily involved in farming. In the past, the family indoctrinated their young in the skills and duties of their future livelihood, but under the present social isolation imposed by the school system such an initiation is ignored. The result of this prac- tice has been the production of an educated elite often divorced from the realities of the daily life surrounding them. To overcome this deficiency schools in developing nations should expose their charges to the experi- ences of common life: tending herds, raising their own food supply, and maintaining the school buildings and grounds. A respect for the dividends of physical labor must be instilled while at the same time recognizing the limitations of the methods considered. This transformation should not be difficult to achieve as most schools of the Third World are already self-contained communities; however, they must be made microcosms of their societies at large. The training should not be considered vocational nor represent a separate subject, rather it should permeate school life and establish a milieu in which the educational process takes place. Then when specific vocational training is required it can build upon the general attitudes and skills already developed in the student body. The educational process and spirit must transcend the class- room to factories and workshops with students learning their aspired professions in the atmosphere and under the conditions they will encounter upon leaving school. Removal of vocational training from the idealized climate of the school could well help reduce the threat of eventual student disillusionment with actual working conditions. With factories, farms, government agencies, and workshops contributing to this educational scheme, the number of facilities accommodating students will be greatly increased without an appreciable increase in financial expenditure. The points thus far considered have been removed from the realm of speculation and now exist at the experimental stage in several developing nations. Perhaps two of the most interesting examples of educational re- thinking and reformation lie in the experiences of Tanzania and the People's Republic of China. Despite disproportionately high educational btudgets, both countries found that their adopted Western educational systems were imbuing students with attitudes and intellectual values that were dysfunctional to existing social and cultural structures. In countering this trend, educators then reevaluated the goals of education more pre- cisely within the scope of national development and modified the school structure and curricula accordingly. 15 Some of these difficulties are illustrated in J. E. Phythian, "Mathematical Kaji- tegemea in Tanzania," Educational Studies in Mathematics 3 (December 1971): 187- 200.</page><page sequence="6">178 Frank J. Swetz In his essay, "Education for Self-Reliance," Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere admitted the failures of British-oriented education in his country and established guidelines for a new national educational system consistent with indigenous needs."' Since 1967, Tanzanian educators have been refin- ing and extending Nyerere's theories. Education now centers arouind service to the people and the nation. Extensive literacy campaigns and adult basic education programs have made impressive inroads among the rural population. Schools adhere to the principles of self-reliance by attempting to become self-sustaining communities. Close coordination between academic institutions and local communities assures an interaction of cooperation and mutual understanding. Previous instructional emphasis on the acquisition of knowledge per se has been modified to promote practical learning related to rural agricultural wvork upon which the coun- try's economy is based. Through such changes education has been brought to the fore in the advancement of Tanzania's social transformation.17 The Chinese experience provides a classic instance of the failure of foreign educational exemplars to satisfy the needs of a developing nation. Chinese educators, in their attempts to emulate Japanese, Americani, and Soviet educational systems respectively, reaped traumatic social conse- quences. Educated youth became an urbanized elite alienated from China's rural population and needs. The inability of educationi to reach China's masses resulted in frequent manifestations of social anid political discon- tent, the most recent being the Great Cultural Revolution when educational reformers sanctioned by the Communist party attained miiany of their long- sought goals. For many years, Mao Tse-tung has advocated a complete reformulation of Chinese education based on socioeconomic relevance.'8 Primarily he sought: (1) reduction of the period of schooling, (2) a lessened emphasis on academic examinations, and (3) a close association between school activities and productive labor experience. Although some of these inno- vations existed briefly before 1967, all were incorporated into postcultural revolution school systems. Under the guidelines of the Lishu Program, the period of schooling was reduced from 12 to 9 years; academic examinations were abolished or made cooperative endeavors; and all Chinese students and teachers were required to obtain productive work experience on farms or in factories.'9 Schools are run by tripartite committees comprised of 6 In his Ujamaa: Essays on Socialism (Dar es Salaam: Oxford University Press, 1968), pp. 44-75. 17 For a fuller discussion of Tanzania's educational progress, see Louis Francis Dolan, Transition from Colonialism to Self-Reliance in Tanzanian Education (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1969). 18 Mao's activities in the field of edlucation predate his military and political involve- ments. He was trained at the First Teacher's Training College, Ch'angsha, from 1913 to 1918, and throughout his life has always exhibited an interest in educational mat- ters.

"Bare- foot" teachers recruited from the proletariat bring their experience to the classroom. A spirit of cooperation and public service permeates all school studies and activities. While the political climate of Chinese advances may be questionable, it is independent from the remaining objectives of nation building exhibited in the Chinese reforms.20 Western education is not to be condemned in its own right, but its suitability for use in non-Western societies with completely diverse cultural, social, and economic conditions should be questioned. The solution for the educational crisis in less-developed nations certainly does not lie in increased external financial and technical assistance as asserted by Coombs, b)ut rests rather with an internal reformulation of educational policies in agreement with national needs and resources.21 Developing nations have proudly confirmed their political independence from Western powers; it is now time they assert their intellectual and educational independence 'with equal pride. m For a more detailed discussion of the educational reforms of the Cultural Revolu- tion, see Frank Swetz, "Chinese Education and the Great Cuiltural Revoluition: A Search for Relevance," Contemporary Education 44 (Januiary 1973): 155-60. 2 Philip H.
