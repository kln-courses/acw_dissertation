<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROGER A. SHINER AISTHESIS, NOUS AND PHRONESIS IN THE PRACTICAL SYLLOGISM (Received 12 September 1978) One of the perennial problems in understanding Aristotle's theory of practical judgment concerns the so-called practical syllogism. The theoretical syl- logistic of the Prior Analytics is ajustly celebrated landmark in man's philosophical joumeyings. However, despite tantalising allusive references, Aristotle notoriously does not provide us with an equally systematic account of practical reasoning. This has led commentators to see how far such an account can be constructed out of the material Aristotle has left us. D. K. Modrak has recently' made a bold attempt to provide a general inferen- tial schema for the practical syllogism, understood as beginning with reasons and ending with an action. Were her thesis correct, we would have been presented with an interpretative tool of great power. However, in my view, Modrak's thesis ultimately fails to represent accurately Aristotle's extremely complex view of how aisthesis ('perception'), nous ('intuition') and phronesis ('practical wisdom') combine in practical judgment and action.2 Moreover, there are general questions which can be raised about the aptness of any attempt to do what Modrak aims to do. Modrak's specific proposal is based upon including in the schema some appropriate propositional attitude towards the sentential components of the practical syllogism. It looks like this: A [M] Al[m] A' [C] (schema 3, p. 381) C' In the case of the categorical syllogism, the appropriate propositional attitude in the corresponding schema (see p. 381) will be assertion.

It cannot again be assertion, because of the problem of akrasia (incontinence): the incontinent asserts his premisses, but does not act on them. Modrak presents only the candidate which she believes should be adopted, namely, aisthesis (382). Aisthesis is of course an extremely attractive candidate. In the first place, as Modrak rightly states, "Aristotle repeatedly stresses the importance of aisthesis in making practical judgments" (ibid.).3 Secondly, moral judgment is practical, for the conclusion of a practical argument is an action (MA 701a1 2); aisthe-sis plays a substantial role in Aristotle's account of movement in de Anima bk. III. Much of what Modrak says on these topics is correct and valuable. However, her thesis is a very strong one, and in putting it forward she takes on commitments that the texts simply do not allow her to fulfill. The specific objections I have are two in number. Firstly, I do not think Modrak can substantiate her claim that aisthesis is the propositional attitude appropriate to the major premiss of the practical syllogism. The reason is, in brief, that such a premiss necessarily involves universals, and in Aristotle's view one does not have aisthesis of universals. My seond point is that to call aisthesis a 'propositional attitude' at all is to misrepresent the similarities and the differences that there are, in Aristotle's view, between human and animal perception. I shall now set out these points in more detail. II I shall begin by setting out texts which show both that and how Aristotle systematically distinguishes aisthesis from phronesis and nous. One can in fact indicate six points of contrast: (i) Fundamental to Aristotle's practical psychology is a three-fold distinc- tion between hexeis, 'developed dispositions', dunameis, 'faculties' and pathe, 'feelings' (cf. EN 1 106al 1). Phronesis and nous, as aretai dianoetikai, 'intellectual virtues', are hexeis of the rational part of the soul, or rather a part of the rational part, to logistikon, 'the calculative part' (EN 1 139al -16). In contrast, aisthesis is not a hexis at all, but a dumanis (APo 99b33). We had the senses before we used them; we did not come to have them by using them. To aisthetikon, 'the sensory part', is a quite distinct part of the soul, and an animal has aisthesis simply in virtue of having at birth that part of the soul (deAn 417b18). (ii) All animals possess aisthesis; phronesis and nous, on the other hand,</page><page sequence="3">THE PRACTICAL SYLLOGISM 379 as manifestations of intellect, are possessed only by rational creatures (chiefly men) (deAn 413b32, 414b18-20, 427b6, 428a20).4 (iii) The intellect in its different manifestations has to do with universals, while the objects of aisthesis are strictly particular (de An 427b8-11,417b22- 3). (iv) Aisthesis requires an object outside of the soul, whereas the intellect operates upon what one might call internal images (de An 417b23-7, APo 100a2-3). (v) Aisthesis is directly connected with the body; it is simply the formal realization of those physical parts of the body which constitute an animal's sensory equipment (cf. e.g. de An 412bI7-413a3, 424a24-8, PN 456alff, 461 a3ff, etc.). It is, on the other hand, unreasonable to think of the intellect as blended with the body at all (de An 429a24), and, although the details are controversial, in so far as Aristotle has at all a doctrine of an immortal, discarnate soul (cf. de An 430a23, 408b 18ff, Metaph 1070a24ff), it is only the intellect that he mentions in this context. (vi) The objects of aisthesis are either the special sensibles, colour, sound, etc., or the common sensibles, movement, number, etc. (de An 418a7ff). Those things which are aisthesis kata sumbebekos, 'incidentally perceptible', such as the son of Diares (i.e., any material object or state of affairs considered as such and not as something coloured, noisy, moving, etc.), are not properly objects of aisthesis, the sensory capacity, at all. Error comes in with respect to perception of aisthe-ta kata sumbebe-kos (de An 428b 18ff), just because incidental perception requires intellectual activity; in cases of perception proper, there is no error (de An 418al2). The proper object of sense does, and the incidental object of sense does not, as such, affect the perceiving soul (de An 418a23). The last of the points just made indicates that, despite Aristotle's insistence on the distinction between aisthesis and intellect in various forms, he is not postulating any radical metaphysical separation of them. Excluding the activity of pure contemplation, other forms of intellectual activity for Aristotle require mental images as their objects; the soul never thinks without an image (de An 431a16). Those images in the first place enter the soul by the operation of sense. However, in its active thinking, the soul far exceeds that passive reception of forms which constitutes the sole form of opera- tion of aisthMsis. 5 APo 99b3 5ff elucidates this with the well-known image of the stopping of a rout in battle. The images of sense strictly conceived</page><page sequence="4">380 ROGER A. SHINER are fleeting and without permanence. In some animals they persist in memory, and this is the beginning of primitive intellectual activity. Memory implies some systematization of these images; but not until it is developed in rational creatures into experience can we speak of an awareness of the universal (APo 100a7-8, 15-16). Experience in turn is the raw material from which develops scientific and practical skill in the fullest sense (APo 100a8-9). So, although the intellectual virtues are at the other end of one single continuum which begins with aisthesis, the separating distance is vast, and encompasses a wholly different order of being. Aisthesis for Aristotle is a broad term, and has been well summed up by Kahn6 as "any capacity possessed by living animals for obtaining information concerning the outside world - for entering into contact with, and hence responding to, their food, their enemies, their mates, their offspring" (46). Practical action is one form which this interaction takes; but it is an idiosyncratic form, because the peculiar skill of one part only of nature, rational creatures. Thus it exhibits the special characteristics of these creatures, as well as features they share with all living things. Two key passages of the EN, in which Aristotle compares and contrasts phronesis, nous and aisthesis, should be read against the above background. These passages are 1142a23-30 and 1143a35-bl3.7 Modrak appeals to them to support her thesis about the propositional attitude for the major premiss (382). But in neither passage does Aristotle say what Modrak's thesis requires him to say, that there is a practical propositional attitude which both has as its objects the beginnings of arguments and is a form of perception. One can give the impression that Modrak is interpreting Aristotle correctly by placing in a row 1142a26-7 (practical wisdom is concerned with the object of perception), 1 143b5 (practical intuition is perception) and 1 143b 1 (intuition grasps the first terms of arguments). However, suspicions that things are not this simple should be aroused by 1142a25; there, in contrast to the talk at 1 143b5 about practical nous, it is said that phronesis is opposed to (antikeitai) nous. The key to interpreting the passages is to realise that nous is not being used in precisely the same sense in each one. When in the first passage Aristotle talks of nous, he has in mind only what he elsewhere (e.g. de An 433al 5) calls nous theo-retikos ('scientific intuition'). It is that virtue by which we know the undemonstrated premisses of scientific</page><page sequence="5">THE PRACTICAL SYLLOGISM 381 demonstrations (1 143b1 -2). It is concerned with particulars only in the sense that it apprehends primary premisses of scientific demonstrations by induction (cf. APo 100b4-18). Its chief object is the universal so apprehended. Phronesis on the other hand, in addition to its proper concern in its 'control- ling' (archetektonike) form with universals (1 141b14-20), has in its other form an equally proper concern with particulars (EN 1142a24-5). Notice, however, that even so at 1 142a30 phronesis is said to be that one of the forms of awareness discussed which is least like aisthesis. In the second passage, practical and scientific nous are carefully distinguished. Nous is linked with aisthesis, and again on grounds of concern with particulars; but practical nous only is being referred to here (1 143b2-5). Though there is mention of a form of intuition which grasp initial premisses, this is specifically and solely scientific intuition (1 143b 1-2). 1 143b9-11 are about intuition in general, not practical intuition in particular.8 Practical wisdom, like any science which requires interaction with the natural world, presupposes an ability to see particular objects and/or states of affairs in the natural world for what they are. So it certainly presupposes the natural faculty of aisthesis. But, more importantly, it presupposes also the developed disposition of nous, the ability to see the universal in the particular. This Aristotle tersely expresses at 1 143b5 by saying that perception of the variable facts is nous. But he means only that nous presupposes aisthesis, not that such a seeing of the universal is aisthesis in the same sense as is seeing, e.g., the red of the blood and the movement of the stabbing knife. These considerations seem to me to be major obstacles to saying that aisthesis is the propositional attitude appropriate to the major premise of the practical syllogism. Whatever the practical syllogism is (and in my view Aristotle's use of the notion is too sporadic and unsystematic to provide certainty in the matter), it is somehow related to practical agents, possessors of deinote-s (the faculty of being able to do things which tend towards goals we have set, and achieving them, or 'cleverness'; cf. EN 1 144a24ff). That presupposes a rational soul and an ability to grasp universals. Aisthesis, as an innate interactive capacity possessed also by non-rational animals, cannot itself be a state of mind which rehearses general truths in practical contexts, even though whatever faculty does so rehearse cannot do without aisthesis. Modrak shows some awareness of these obstacles, but thinks they are surmountable. She claims that "there is a sense in which the major premiss</page><page sequence="6">382 ROGER A. SHINER of a practical syllogism is particular" (382). This claim evinces a misunder- standing of what Aristotle means by saying practical truth is truth hos epi to polu, 'for the most part' (cf. EN 1094b21). Modrak's explication of her point is that the truth of the major premiss of the practical syllogism is "situation-dependent, i.e., the circumstances in which it is asserted are relevant to determining its truth-value" (382). A statement such as 'Every person ought to walk' (panti badisteon anthrUpUi, MA 701al2) is not always true. That is, if I understand Modrak aright, it is true when (case A) I need to strengthen my legs after surgery, but not true when (case B) I have just broken my leg skiing. In case A, one who says to me 'Every person ought to walk' speaks truly; in case B, one who says to me 'Every person ought to walk' speaks falsely. My medical situation in case A makes the remark true, and in case B makes it false.9 So, for Modrak, there is a sense in which the major premiss of the practical syllogism is particular. This analysis misrepresents the logic of Aristotle's category of statements which are true for the most part. What is true in case A and not in case B is the particular statement 'I ought to walk' (cf. 'This patient should have honey-water', which might be false if the person were a diabetic). The truth of 'I ought to walk' is situation-dependent. The nature of practical matters means that 'Every person ought to walk' is not universally true, as is, e.g., "Fire is always light and moves upwards, while earth and all earthy things move downwards" (de Caelo 308bl3-5). But case B does not show that 'Everyone ought to walk' is false; it shows that the kind of truth it has is not universal truth, but 'for the most part' truth. Truth 'for the most part' is still truth. The idea that a putatively universal truth is in fact true for one person in one situation and not for another in another smacks more of the Protagorean relativism Aristotle rejects (cf. Metaph 101 lb4ff.) than it does of Aristotle himself. As Jonathan Barnes has righthly remarked,10 Aristotle uses his epi to polu as a 'quasi-modal operator'. Let H(A) = 'A is true for the most part'. Then this operator functions so that, whereas we can infer immediately Pa D Wa from (x)(Px D Wx), we cannot infer immediately Pa D Wa from H(Px D Wx). It will depend on the individual particular circumstances whether this person ought to walk. It is the task of practical wisdom qua concerned with particulars to judge whether the case is the exception or the rule, as we say. I exercise practical wisdom in seeing that, despite it being true for the most part that every person ought to walk, in case B I ought not to walk. Aristotle's</page><page sequence="7">THE PRACTICAL SYLLOGISM 383 H-operator would license (cf. Barnes ibid.) the inference rule IH(AD B) D Hl(B D C) H HI(A D C), whatever A, B and C are, provided that they are in the domain of the variable. This is simply impossible on the semantics allowed by Modrak's interpretation of truth 'for the most part' as corres- pondence with particular situations. Modrak is enticed into her misunderstanding by an inaccurate reading of MA 701al2ff. She says that there Aristotle gives the premise 'Every man ought to walk' "and its contrary in the same breath" (383). If he does, then it would be hard to see how he could think that 'Every man ought to walk' and 'No man ought to walk' were both "true for the most part". So, reading the MA passage this way, she implicitly rejects an account such as mine. But careful attention to the Greek would show that Aristotle's second example is not the bald 'No man ought to walk'. He says at MA 701al4, an d' hoh oudeni badisteon NUN anthropoi, "if you think [noesei understood from al2] that in some particular circumstances no man ought to walk" (my emphasis and translation). In other words, Aristotle is contrasting with the general statement 'Every man ought to walk' something like 'No man who has just broken his leg ought to walk'; the nun implies, not a fully general state- ment, but a more specific statement of a subsidiary principle. Such a principle is in no way the contrary of 'Every man ought to walk'. Thus the MA passage conforms entirely to the model I am presenting of 'for the most part' truth, and does not at all require us to attribute to Aristotle the relativised truth of Modrak's analysis. III The other difficulty which I wish to point out is, as I said, that the assump- tion that aisthesis is a propositional attitude is too blunt an instrument to preserve the fine texture of Aristotle's theory of aisthesis. I do not mean that no sense can be made at all of the thought that aisthesis is a propositional attitude. Some sense can be made of that although in that sense it is, as the above has shown, ineluctably particular. But the sense that can be made of it makes such exploitation of this thought as Modrak undertakes an extremely dangerous enterprise. Let me recall the points about aisthesis that were made above. As a natural dumanis, possessed in full by animals at birth, it cannot involve anything intellectual. It is realized in the interaction of all animals with their environ-</page><page sequence="8">384 ROGER A. SHINER ment. Its functioning is by Aristotle in the psychological treatises carefully mapped on to a physiological system in the body (cf. Kahn 59, 64ff). It works by the reception from outside of images of particular instances of the special and common sensibles. In rational animals, it is indeed a necessary concomitant of intellectual activity; but it is not itself that intellectual activity. All of this might be summed up by saying that aisthesis for Aristotle is non-noetic. Human aisthesis differs from animal aisthesis in that in humans aisthesis has certain functional connexions with the human intellect that it does not have in animals (cf. APo I.l19). But to aisthetikon, the sensory part of the soul, is in itself the same in rational as in non-rational creatures. This being so, there is in my view something misleading about the whole project of calling aisthesis a propositional attitude. Certainly, Aristotle's texts are full of examples of men perceiving that certain things are the case. Moreover, these perceptions are associated with desires in the production of human action.' 1 Thus it might seem needlessly pedantic, and even foolhardy, to assert that aisthe-sis is non-noetic and is not a propositional attitude. But the point that I am making, and that in my view Modrak overlooks, is that these instances of human awareness (using that as a neutral, non-theory- laden, non-question-begging, aseptic, etc., etc. term) for Aristotle come about not merely by the operation of to aisth-tikon in the way that awareness of red or of shape does come about merely by the operation of to aisthe-tikon. Modrak says confidently in footnote 35 that "sumbee-ekos objects are true objects of perception for Aristotle"; but this is misleading. She has in mind presumably de An 418a9, where one category of 'sensibles' (aisthe-ta) are aistheta kata sumbebekos. But for the meaning of this intended by Aristotle, one must refer to a20-5 shortly after. One perceives the son of Diares incidentally, because the white patch one perceives is incidentally the son of Diares (cf. also the parallel 'son of Cleon' example at de An 425-25). But ouden paschei hei toiouton hupo tou aisthe-tou, one is not in such a case affected by the object of perception itself (de An 418a23). Aristotle goes on to say that the special objects of sense are kuriis aistheta, sensible in the fullest sense.12 The remark about not being affected is significant, in the light of the close connexion between perception and a physiological mechanism. The colour, shape, etc. of a physical object affect a person's sensory apparatus. In virtue of the developed intellectual dispositions he or she possesses, he or she recognises the son of Diares. This awareness builds on,</page><page sequence="9">THE PRACTICAL SYLLOGISM 385 but is not reducible to, the sensory apparatus being affected (cf. again APo 11.19). The notion of a 'propositional attitude' derives from human perception as the standard case; but what leads us to the notion are precisely those features of human perceptual awareness which differentiate it from sense-perception proper, and which imply the human intellect. It might be possible to explicate a sense in which Aristotle's aisthesis, even granted its non-noetic character, can be thought of as a propositional attitude.13 It has been pointed out that Aristotle represents perception as images entering the soul from outside. Therefore, when a man and a cat both look at something red, the same image enters the soul of each. The cat can only react by arching its back and spitting, or whatever; the man has available responses such as that it is the same colour as Aunt Jane's shawl, or that he must stop the car. But the only difference between the two cases is that the man can exploit the information which is in his soul, and the cat cannot. Both souls, according to this mechanistic view of perception, receive the information. But in the cat, it does not linger and is gone in a flash. Now, in virtue of the fact that we can speak of 'the same information' being in the soul in each case, we can speak of even the aisthesis that is the cat's as a 'propositional attitude'. I do not know whether Modrak would be willing to espouse such a tempting line of argument; certainly it seems to do something to ground the notion of a propositional attitude, while being faithful to Aristotle's descrip- tions of aisthesis as the same in animals and men. But I do not think that it will ultimately do. For are not questions being begged in calling the image that is in the animal's soul 'information'? A sponsor of this line of argument is in the following dilemma. Either 'information' is interpreted so that only those have information who know that they have it; in which case, the paradigm of an information-possessor is the rational human, and animals do not possess information. Or 'information' is given a purely operational definition, in terms of what must be postulated to link a given in-put with a given out-put; in which case it certainly fits well the case of animal percep- tion, and indeed the Aristotelian concept of aisthesis, but it fits ill the notion of a 'propositional attitude'. There is no way via the notion of 'infor- mation' to link the fundamentally human concept of 'propositional attitude' and the fundamentally animal Aristotelian concept of aisthesis.</page><page sequence="10">386 ROGER A. SHINER IV Let me conclude with the following general observation. Aristotle is not offering an 'account of practical reasoning' in the sense of a formal schema for practical inferences. He is rather doing (at least much of the time) a priori psychology, or practical philosophy of mind. He is setting out for us the conceptual equipment we need to understand philosophically practical agency and practical judgment. He has a complex vision of man as a unique kind of animal, in whom aspects of human psychology peculiar to humans and aspects of human psychology shared with animals both have vital roles to play. The recurrent patterns he diagnoses in the rich variety of human acts defy reduction to a simple inferential schema. Such simple pictures are useful; indeed they are. They usually have in sharp focus some part of how practical judgment seems to Aristotle. But the stark bright light they concentrate on such a part, as Modrak concentrates on aisthiesis, leaves the rest in shadowy obscurity. By provoking a response which tries to illuminate the parts in obscurity, a fuller picture of the whole may be obtained. I have tried to discuss Modrak's paper with such a hermeneutic goal in view. University of Alberta NOTES 1 'Aisthesis in the Practical Syllogism', Philosophical Studies 30 (1976), pp. 379-91. 2 Just because Aristotle's theory of practical judgment is complex, the relatively brief remarks I make in this paper may be held to raise more questions than they answer. The view adumbrated here is defended at much greater length in my 'Aristotle on moral intuition', forthcoming. 3 Paradigmatically EN 1109b23 and 1126b4; cf. also the other passages cited by Modrak in her footnote 19. ' In fact (cf. Metaph 980b22ff, PA 648a5ff, EN 1141a26ff) Aristotle does on occasion ascribe phronesis to animals under special circumstances, viz. when the animals in ques- tion exhibit behaviour which lends itself to description in anthropomorphic terms. This represents a preanalytic grasp on Aristotle's part of the similarities between human and animal behaviour, and of the relevance of those similarities to the ascription to humans and animals of mental predicates. But he makes no attempt to incorporate these insights into his 'official' philosophy of mind. I Cf. Joseph Owens, The ground of universality in Aristotle', American Philosophical Quarterly 3 (1966), pp. 162-9. 6 Charles H. Kahn, 'Sensation and Consciousness in Aristotle's psychology', Archiv fur Geschichte der Philosophie 48 (1966), pp. 43-81.</page><page sequence="11">THE PRACTICAL SYLLOGISM 387 I Both the text and the interpretation of these passages is the subject of much scholarly dispute. The line taken here is defended at greater length in Part I of the paper referred to in footnote 2. 8 Bywater (in the Oxford Classical Text) relocates these lines after 1 143b5, which makes their sense evident. The drift of thought is unintelligible where they stand. I This is a perfectly fair example. It seems just like one of Aristotle's own illustrations for 'for the most part' at Metaph 1027a22. There he says, "That honey-water is beneficial for a patient in a fever is true for the most part". 10 In his Clarendon Aristotle commentary on the Posterior Analytics (Oxford 1975), p. 184. '" Most of what Modrak says about desire and movement in pp. 385-8 of her paper is fair enough. But it is noticeable that at one point her grip on the relation between human features of humans and animal features of humans again culpably falters. She rightly explicates the discussion of desire and movement in de An III and MA, culminating in the remark that the efficient cause of movement is orexis. She then proceeds immediately to apply this to the case of human practical agents, which is her primary concern. But the account she has described is of any animal movement as such. Practical action by human agents is a particular kind of movement. The efficient cause of it, of praxis rather than kine-sis, is said by Aristotle in the EN, the treatise which discusses it, to be choice (proairesis) (EN 1139a32). Now, choice is defined as "either desiderative reason or ratiocinative desire" (1139b4-5; trans. Ross), e orektikos nous e orexis dianoitike. Thus an essential part of the antecedents of practical action is the use of the intellect. This again throws a great deal of strain on the thought that aisthesis is sufficient to generate praxis (cf. p. 387); the mistake on Modrak's part is essentially that which occurs throughout her paper. 12 As D. W. Hamlyn in his Clarendon Aristotle commentary (Oxford, 1968) points out (108), this remark takes no account of Aristotle's subsequent references to a 'common sense' which has the capability of perceiving the common sensibles. But even so, the case of incidental sensibles is a different matter. '3 This was suggested to me by my colleague Bernard Linsky.</page></plain_text>
