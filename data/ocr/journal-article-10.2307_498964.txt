No one could reproach Mrs. Van Buren for not being a most diligent and enthusiastic archaeolo- gist. Again she has visited the leading Museums of the Old and the New World: Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin, Constantinople, Baghdad, New York, Yale, Harvard, Philadelphia, and scruti- nized private collections, the Southeck, Morgan, and the Ur collections. And the result of that un- tiring work is a corpus of the flowing vases in fifteen chapters and eight pages of bibliography. Three chapters are devoted to the flowing vases and the gods represented; four to such representations from archaic times down to the period of Agade; six cover the period of Gudea, third dynasty of Ur, first dynasty of Babylon, the second and first millennia. Two additional chapters treat of the same subject in Syro-Cappadocian art, and in the art of the Khabur region (Tell Halaf). Mrs. Van Buren has been fascinated by the subject so admirably studied years ago by L0on Heuzey in his "Le bassin sculpte et le symbole du vase jaillissant." She is conquered by the admirable decorative artistic treatment, which reveals so fully religious ideas. She calls that rightly an engrossing but complicated and exten- sive subject. At times the evidence so abundant and yet so indefinite and contradictory makes her hesitate. But she bravely makes up her mind and decides that the God with streams is Ea of Eridu, and whoever holds a flowing vase belongs to his family. And a large one it is, seven boys, and seven girls, and many servants, Marduk, Tammuz, Dumuzi abzu, Usmil the bifrons, Ningizzida, the water nymphs, the seven daugh- ters of Bau, the Igigi, the Arumaki. And es- pecially the wild man, the old Gilgamesh, the hero hunter fighting wild beasts, is resolutely entered into the clan, with a "Therefore he should not be called the nude hero, but should be given his proper designation of a son of Ea," because once in a while he is represented holding a flowing vase, or a door post. All this sounds a little revolu- tionary. And even Ea, the god of the deep abyss, of springs and rivers, and naturally a god of vegetation, is declared a sun god, and so were members of his family, especially Marduk. And "it is probable that some of his functions were confused with those of Shamash. Either of them as judge might hold the toothed sword."-So, poor Shamash is stripped of his old prerogatives, the rays of light, the toothed sword, even the mountain climbing, to the benefit of the watery tribe of Ea. How much more to the point the remarks of Mrs. Van Buren about evolution in art, and re- ligious ideas; about how conceptions alter, and legends keep adding or transferring from one god to another; how an epithet becomes a personal- ity. And at times the inevitable confusion of types and gods. But in spite of the wise theory, Mrs. Van Buren is "tempted." The bird man is brought in judgment; he is not the bad Zu bird, and no texts so far have been discovered to ex- plain his story. But Usmdi and the other officers who have him arrested are members of Ea's family. They return triumphantly, the magic plant has been retrieved, and the thief is a captive. The God with the flowing vase cannot be any- body but Ea. The acrobatic fighting heroes must be the six sons of Ea. The water nymphs are goddesses of the same family-which is true of Nina. The perplexing male and female deities of the Karaindash temple at Uruk, are, thanks to the flowing vases, placed definitely in the family of Ea. Men and women, dressed or nude, holding a "not" flowing vase are lesser divinities of the court of Ea. All told, seals are seals and texts are texts. And the glyptic representations are so much older than the texts, that we cannot trust late literature, scarcely anterior to the Isin- Larsa and First Babylonian dynasty, to explain in detail works of art devised a thousand years be- fore. Even in the late edition of the Gilgamesh epic, it is not quite exact that he is "never cele- brated as fighting wild beasts." It is expressly stated that he and Enkidu used to fight the lions and the wild bull of heaven, and other monsters. But the very type of the classical Gilgamesh in front face, with wild locks of hair and only a belt, holding in his arms two rampant bisons, is found on a royal harp of the time of Sbubad, when scarcely any figure of the god with flowing vase was known. The type of the hero hunter-half a man, half a god-may have been transferred to the hero fisher-goatfish, fish, tortoise--of the marsh land. But this is also, up to the Elamite hills, the land of Nimrod. And as far as Eridu and the water god are con- cerned, it is not certain the flowing vase is an ab- brievated symbol of the god with streams. I am in turn "tempted" to believe that the reverse process is the true one, and that the abzu water-</page><page sequence="2">514 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY basin, and the flowing vase, and the tarkullu post, or kiskanu tree existed in Eridu long before any anthropomorphic representation of Ea. In fact the oldest graphic for the city of Eridu, is a great tarkullu post: NUN. And the archaic figure of a tree on the summit of mountains between goats heraldically grouped, is the original one and can- not be presumed to replace a god's figure elimi- nated by degrees. But these remarks on a theory more or less underlying the whole volume, must not blind us to its great merit: the large field covered, the detailed and penetrating description of each seal or work of art, the grouping by periods, and the extension of research to the Cappadocian, Syrian, and Khabur regions. Such a monograph is a real inspiration and a guide. A last wish is for a drawing of each seal when a photograph is not possible. Seeing is believing.
