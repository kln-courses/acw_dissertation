<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN EARLY RITUAL POEM IN WELSH BY MARY WILLIAMS STUDENTS of Arthurian literature will remember a poem published in the Myvyrian Archaeology' entitled 'A Conversation between Arthur and his second wife Gwenhwyvar who was taken away by Melwas, Lord of Alban,' in which apparently the Queen is at first unable to recognize her husband, a man of moderate size, who is not to be compared in size or valor with Cai the Tall, son of Sefin. She remembers seeing him on a previous occasion at a long table in Devon pouring out wine for his friends. It now appears that only the names of Cai and Gwenhwyvar occur in the manuscript. A blank in the line containing the reference to the long table was filled in by the editors of the Myv. Archaeology who thought it ought to be Arthur's court: they also added the title, upon which so much has since been built. In the last number of the Bulletin of the Board of Celtic StudieS2 Mr Evan D. Jones of the National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth) has published a poem now in the Library and which is evidently another version of the above poem. He calls this latter (Llanstephan 122, 426) B and his own (Wynnstay, i, 91) A. A comparison of the two shows that some lines are almost identical, others are quite different. Unfortunately A is very defective in parts, some lines (possi- bly whole stanzas) appear to be wanting entirely, words are missing in others, and some are too corrupt to be understood. A was copied in the sixteenth century by Thomas ap William of Trefriw, N. Wales from a manuscript which is itself a copy of a much older one. The spelling of one word in -a6ch, rhyming with others all in -och, an old spelling never found in T. W.'s writings, suggests he was copying a word which he did not understand (it is for that matter, corrupt, the line should read: 'Ymhla le ym gwelsoch,' as in B, originally: im g6elsa6ch), and therefore copied it as it stood, fortunately, as this may prove that the manuscript goes back to the thirteenth century when w was written 6, although this letter continued to be used until considerably later, but not the spelling -a6ch. As Professor Ifor Williams has so clearly shown in his excellent study of the poem Ymddiddan Arthur a'r Eryr3 ('Arthur's Conversation with the Eagle') the present form of a poem can be no guide to its age. During the short period of 125 years (1425-1550) old poems were drastically revised to bring them up to date. The copyists almost rewrote them, not merely giving later forms of the same word but substituting other terms for obsolete or obsolescent words: e.g., offeren, 'mass' was replaced by gwasanaeth Sul, 'Sunday service.' He has shown by a careful examination of several versions (which fortunately still exist) that the original must go back to about 1150, and suggests that no doubt copyists between 1150 and 1425 were in their turn responsible for even more changes in the original. We may add they were doing what Chretien de Troyes and others 1 Myv. Arch. of Wales (2nd ed., 1870), p. 130.

Arch., pp. 130-132. 38</page><page sequence="2">An Early Ritual Poem in Welsh 39 accuse poets of their day of doing, 'despecier et corrompre suelent' -'they are accustomed to cut up and corrupt'.' A comparison of the two poems at present known, A and B, shows they are each a copy of older poems which in all probability go back ultimately to a longer poem which we may also very plausibly date to about 1150 or even earlier. As Professor Williams has said in speaking of Ym5ii5an Arthur, a poet familiar with the idea of Arthur as king at Caerleon would not represent him as a local king of Devon (Dyfneint-Dumnonia). Similarly in this instance. It is true that Arthur's name is nowhere mentioned, but we may gather it was his court in Devon which the poet had in mind, since we know that it was from his court that his queen was abducted.2 A and B are no more copied from one another than they are from an imme- diate source, for even among the stanzas which are alike (at most six) not one is an exact copy of the other. Each contains stanzas which do not occur in the other, as well as stanzas which can be shown to be derived through intermediate forms from a common poem 0. As an instance of this we may compare A10 b c d with B9a b c. In this case A10 b seems to represent 0 more perfectly than B9a. Mewn llys has become Mi welais, vrdasol (written with tall s) has been read as vr(wr)gra5ol, i braint as o faint. Mention of the llys (court) is required and the contradiction of B6b where the speaker is 'bychan', (short) and B9a where the same person is of 'moderate' size is apparent. On the other hand, B9b ar fwrdd hir is probably nearer 0 than A10 d lle dwir gwir which, as it stands, has no meaning. Until a third version is discovered, it is difficult even to suggest the original form of the poem, which probably consisted of stanzas of three lines, some possi- bly of four, each of seven syllables. The two poems which we now possess, how- ever, help each other considerably in determining the meaning and purport of the original. That what follows may be more easily understood I append both A and B as printed in the Bulletin, followed by a translation, while waiting for a more authoritative philological study by one of our Welsh scholars.

Gwenhwyvar of facetious speech vain words are natural from a woman's mouth there didst thou see me. I owe many thanks to my colleagues Mr Stephen J. Williams, and Mr Melville Richards, both of the Department of Welsh, for help generously given in sug- gesting some translations of obscure words in A: the attempt at assigning the stanzas to their respective speakers is, however, my own responsibility. In the translation of B already given by Rhys (op. cit.) I have made a few changes in order to give a more literal version of the original. NOTES St. 2 a. Note the use of the definite article which is natural if the meaning of the name Melwas is preserved. 'The Noble Youth' is one of the names given to the candidate for initiation. It occurs also in 8 c. b. 'golden' and 'gilded' are redundant: the line is probably incorrect. St. 3 a. snevin, its meaning is uncertain, it may be incorrect. B appears to have changed the original to Cai Hir ap Sefin and thus to have altered the metre. Cai is always known otherwise as the son of Cynyr Ceinvarvawc (Loth, Mab. i, 9256, n. 1). d. Is evidently the third line of a stanza spoken by Gwenhwyvar, as suggested by Mr E. D. Jones. vin, read win: yn i win, 'in his cups': cf. 'yn i gwrw.' St. 4 a. Read Mi for Ni. b. gemyn. I take this to be a dialectal form of gymaint, of which there are several varie- ties, gymin, gimin(t), etc. c. before drai add gaulan as in Myv. Arch. This is to be preferred to gan lan of Llan. 122. St. 5 a. The line is a syllable short:? read Tydi for Taw, as in 7 a. b. Add wyt after onyt. Cf. B 5 b. c. To be preferred to B 5 c ganfed, as the measure of the line is thus preserved. St. 6 b. with bychan cf. Bychan ei oet, 'small his age' i.e., young. (B.B.C. xxvii). c. Gai is to preferred to gant of B. At the same time Melwas may remember that when Cai went to battle he fought alone against a hundred (B.B.C. 96, 7-8). St. 7 a. ar ben maint. The meaning is uncertain:? 'in charge of a number'; but the line is short of a syllable. b. Ai 'with his'; although 3rd per., it can be used in reference to a pronoun of the 2nd per. Coch in Welsh is often used of 'pink,' for which there is no word other than coch goleu 'light red' or gwelwgoch, 'pale red.' In connection with 'lungs' it must mean 'pink' and refers to Melwas' complexion, that of a young lad (cf. 'bychan' 6 b). It is spoken rather derisively, much as one might refer to a boy's 'schoolgirl complexion,' to his disgust. St. 9 a and b. Verbs and pronouns are now in the 2nd per. plur. It would seem as though this stanza is to be attributed to Cai, who refers to the dialogue which had been going on be- tween Gwenhwyvar and Melwas and which Melwas had suggested should be 'left at that.' But both these lines are a syllable short: it is possible neither A 9 nor B 8 accurately repre- sent the original.</page><page sequence="6">An Early Ritual Poem in Welsh 43 c. Is part of a proverb: Atwen mab ae lla6ch.nyt atwen ae kar (Cymmrodor vii, 139). I owe this reference to Mr Richards. 'A lad knows who pets (fondles) him: he knows not who loves him.' This line which is here placed under St. 9 may, however, be the first of a stanza spoken by Gwenhwyvar who continues: 'Dwedwch i mi os gwydda6ch, Ymhle le gynt ym gwelsa6ch,' 'Tell me if you know, Where have you already seen me?' to which Melwas replies 10 b-d. St. 10 a. As it is, the line is too short by a syllable. yr ymdelsa6ch is evidently to be read as ym gwelsa6ch, i.e. ym gwelsoch as in B 8 c, rhyming originally with lla6ch, the correct form of lloch which has been altered to rhyme with rhagoch. As already noted, it is easy to see how 10 b has become 9 a. c. o Geraint is to be read as in B 9 c: oe = iw. Geraint has been given a capital G owing to Dyfnaint (10 d), the copyist having in mind 'Geraint son of Erbin, Prince of Dyfnaint.' d. lle dwir gwir, which is meaningless, has replaced arfwrdd hir of B 9 b. Those who are familiar with medieval Welsh manuscripts will realize how easily these changes can take place. St. 11 b. It is possible 'gwaell' has been introduced as it referred also to Cai's office of dystein or 'steward.' It will be remembered that at the beginning of the romance 'larlles y Ffynnawn' Cai goes to the kitchen and returns with collops of meat on skewers for the knights to eat while they listen to Kynon's story. In the romance of Perlesvaus' also Keus suggests to Arthur that the foremost of the three harts which draw the cart carrying the heads would provide many collops. In the French romances Cai is replaced by Keus which means 'cook' (otherwise written Quex, Queus). Attention is often drawn to the fact that in the Welsh versions similar to French poems Welsh names are substituted: Gwalchmei, Peredur, Gereint, for Gauvain, Perceval, Erec, etc. Here we have an example of exactly the opposite where the Welsh name Kei, Cai, has been replaced by an epithet which de- scribes him or rather his office. It has been suggested2 that Calogrenant, the equivalent of Kynon in the French poem stands for Cai lo grenant, 'C. the grumbler.' If that is so, then Calogrenant and Keus are two names for the same person, just as Maheloas (Melwas) and Meleaguant, both used by Chretien de Troyes, refer to the same person: he was, of course, unaware of this. St. 12 d. The last line, hwde di hwde dithe, is exceedingly interesting as it suggests the two men then draw their swords and lunge at one another. An expression common in N. Wales, it means 'Take' (hold =Fr. Tiens!) plur. hwdiwch: mid-Cardiganshire hwre, hwriwch, S. Cards. hwrwch. It appears unknown further south. (Melwas) 'Take this!' (Cai) 'You take that!' The last line, as well as the general nature of the two poems A and B, suggested to me that we have here the remains of a dramatized form of some ritual. If we remember the story of Melwas, who is known principally for his abduction of Guinevere, a story which may be a Celtic version of the abduction of Persephone by Pluto, itself a dramatized form of the exoteric myth of the Eleusinian mys- teries,3 it is natural to see in our poems of Melwas a ritual in which Melwas is the candidate seeking initiation into such a mystery. On my submitting my man- uscript to my friend, Colonel R. G. Berry, M.R.I.A., who hopes to publish a volume on Grail origins in the near future, he confirmed my ideas and, out of the store of his knowledge of mystery cults, Grail and Irish literature also sup- plied me with important details. 1 Perlesvaus, ed.

The Lodge (often called a castle, as in Perlesvaus) is represented as a banqueting hall, in which at a long table on a dais the higher initiates are already seated. Below them is another table where lesser initiates feast, while still further below are those who, though admitted to the hall, are as yet only beholders, not partakers. At the banquet 'wine' (gno- sis) is served to the companions (ceraint-A1O c), but not to those beyond, and things are said and done, exactly as at the Grail table. We may compare with this the banquet in the wilderness where the followers of Joseph of Arimathea sit at a table on which is a cup and a fish: the good are filled, but the evil receive nothing and are sent empty away.' The first stanza of A is spoken by Cai, including the first line of the next, in which he calls upon Melwas to come forward, unless we are to understand that this is Melwas' reply to the question 'Who is the man, etc.,' The neophyte has already passed the porter in circumstances probably very like those we find at the beginning of Kulhwch and Olwen.2 Here Kulhwch seeks admission to the court of King Arthur that he may be initiated into knighthood. The porter is Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr (The Hoary One of the Mighty Grasp) who is Arthur's porter every first day of January only: four others perform this office every other part of the year (evidence that both date and office have a special significance). A long dialogue ensues in which Kulhwch, the 'Youth' is well tested: he is tempted in many ways; food and drink of all sorts are offered to him, music and entertainment and the company of a fair lady, all of which is very reminiscent of the tests undergone by the neophyte, as for instance by the 'Green Knight', in certain stories by Perceval, and by many others. Having successfully resisted he is allowed to enter, but even then Cai objects. Arthur cuts Kulhwch's hair with much ceremony, using golden scissors with silver loops. This was a rite practised among the Celts before entry was allowed into the ranks of the warriors (otherwise knighthood). In the case of Kulhwch it signified that Arthur had accepted the role of parent towards the candidate: he had become his 'Father,' using the word in a mystical sense. With this we may compare the story of Vortigern, who sent his son (by his own daugh- ter) to Germanus, with the same request of hair-cutting and consequent adop- tion, and also a ceremony still practised in the Balkans at a christening, where the godfather cuts the child's hair and thus becomes its near relative, so near that marriage between their descendants is henceforth forbidden. This ceremony was observed when the present King of England as Duke of York stood sponsor for the son of the then King of Yugoslavia. The two royal families are now con- sidered to be so closely related that marriage between them will be impossible. In the same story (Kulhwch and Olwen) Cai has the same difficulty in entering the hall of Gwrnach Gawr (G. the Giant). Only because he is a craftsman and brings his craft is he allowed to enter: he has 'knowledge,' and so the door is open. Similarly, in the story of Gereint son of Erbin, Glewlwyd is the chief porter at Arthur's court: here we are told that he performed the office only at one of I Robert de Borron, Estoire dou Graal, Class. fr. du moy. dge (1927), 11. 2555 if. 2 Evans, Red Bk. Mab. (1887), pp. 103 and 196, Loth, Mab. i, 251 and 318,</page><page sequence="8">An Early Ritual Poem in Welsh 45 the high festivals, for he had seven men to serve him and they divided the year amongst them, a statement which again brings out the ritual nature of his office. In the Black Book of Carmarthen' we find among the early poems one in which Arthur seeks to gain admittance for Cai. The porter is again Glewlwyd. Arthur enumerates at length the mighty deeds of Cai, including his encounter with the nine witches and the Palug Cat. He is evidently standing sponsor for Cai. This must represent an early stage in Cai's career before he has reached the position of being himself the initiator. It is the business of the Porter to guard the Thresh- old, the sacred entrance to the Lodge, to challenge every candidate for admis- sion and naturally to prevent his entry unless worthy. Melwas, the neophyte, is 'The Youth,' as his name tells us, Y Melwas, 'The Noble Youth,' this being one of the names by which the neophyte is known. Kulhwch is called'theYouth,'and this is the meaning, too, of Mabon who is related to Modron (Matrona) as Melwas is to Gwenhwyvar. The 'Mabinogion' also are 'Youths', 'bardic disciples,' who are often called 'little pigs':2 this may explain the name Melwys (Mael gwys) son of Baeddan, 'Noble Pig, son of Little Boar,' Baeddan being originally the name for the pig-headed initiator whom we may compare with Anubis the jackal-headed and others.3 Lancelot is yet another candidate, as his name implies: it is derived from L'ancel-ot, "The Young Server' (cf. ancele&lt;ancilla, 'maidservant,' a diminutive of ancula, from an old verb anclare or anculare, 'to serve'). Another form of the same name is Lancelin. Per- ceval is known as the 'Son of the Widow,'fils de la Veve, which is also a name for the neophyte and the initiate. Melwas, the neophyte, has been allowed to enter, but he has as yet no share in the feast: he sits below the Hall, beyond the circle of the initiated and out of hearing. The Hierophant or Magus, hoary in knowledge (cf. Glewlwyd, also 'the Hoary'), calls upon him to come forward and introduces him as 'The Noble Youth from Ynys Wydrin' who thereupon makes his declaration, a negative con- fession as in the Egyptian mysteries, addressing the Hierophant: 'Thou with the golden caskets, I have drunk none of thy wine,' meaning that he is as yet ignorant, he has no 'knowledge.' Cai replies that he gives no 'wine' until the candidate Melwas has given proof of his courage. It is Cai's office to serve out to each his share, according to his rank: the Hierophant must see that all are fed in plenty on the 'meat' that comes from the Goddess' store. Gwenhwyvar interposes with a stanza querying his valor, and suggests he is not the equivalent of Cai in his 'wine,' i.e. in wisdom or gnosis. The neophyte's valor is usually tested at the Ford, where sword tests 1 B.B.C. (Evans, 1906), 94. 2 Ibid., p. 52 ff. Cf. Frazer, op. cit., p. 469, ?2, 'Demeter, the Pig and the Horse' ?3, 'Attis, Adonis, and the Pig,' ?4, 'Osiris, the Pig, and the Bull.' 3 Colonel Berry tells me that he has a sketch from a mediaeval manuscript which shows such a pig-headed initiator. Can Bademagus be derived from Baed (boar) and Magus, hierophant? In the Roman de la Charrette (F oerster), 6324 ff. (Comfort, Everyman's Lib., p. 349), Bademagus speaks to his son Meleaguant using much the same words as Cai to Melwas, chiding him for his folly and adding how difficult it is for him (B) to esteem Meleaguant. He persuades his son to give up the Queen and thus acts exactly as Zeus (Jupiter) did when he commanded Pluto to give up Persephone (Proserpine). But see Brugger, ZFSL., xxviii (1905), 10 ff.</page><page sequence="9">46 An Early Ritual Poem in Welsh took place. It is there, for instance, that Cuchulain in the Tdin bo cu'algne meets all his opponents, which is one of his tests for initiation. In the Roman de la Charrette we have the Sword Bridge which must be crossed if Lancelot is to gain access to Meleaguant's land of Goirre (the Other-world). Here his courage is tested, while Gawain goes to the 'Water Passage'; this is only another form of the same test. Elsewhere the Ford, or the passage from one state to another, from one degree to a higher one, is represented by the Threshold, as in Perlesvaus. Melwas replies that he would wade a ford, even if it were a fathom deep, and he adds, having been challenged, that he has come fully armed, whole in mind and body, ready to encounter any opponent, on 'the shore of the ebb-tide.' Colonel Berry tells me he has come across this expression as a metaphor for the dividing line between two states, and as synonymous with 'threshold.' Gwen- hwyvar, who represents the Goddess, admonishes him to silence. He is not to speak of what he sees or hears. She doubts whether his valor is great, and suggests he cannot stand up to Cai, even as one of eight, i.e., even if he were like the Chief Porter, the leader of a company of seven (as in the story of Gereint). Melwas, the candidate, proceeds to address the Goddess before whom he stands desiring to become her 'Youth.' He begs her not to despise and reject him, al- though he is so young and as yet inexperienced. Like the youth Perceval, who came to Arthur's court ready to meet any antagonist, Melwas declares he is ready to meet Cai and prove his worth all alone. The attribute of the deer's glance or gaze to Gwenhwyvar reminds one of the Fianna literature where the goddess continually changes into a deer. Gwenhwyvar again tells Melwas that he is very young and very different from Cai, but she suggests he is entering on the right road: on that road amongst those who have partaken of the mystery fare and are 'drunk' on it there is 'feebleness,' in contrast to the 'strength' which is necessary outside. In view of the fact that a previous meeting is mentioned, it would seem as though Melwas is now seeking admission into a second degree. A verse in B makes Gwenhwyvar say she thinks she has already seen him, which would be a natural remark to make, to which Melwas would answer in the affirmative. B seems to have omitted something and to have misunderstood the position, for Melwas would be asked (not ask; it is for the candidate to answer, not ask ques- tions, cf. the advice given to Perceval-Peredur, not to be continually asking questions) by the representative of the Goddess whether he remembered seeing her and where. He would reply that it was at the long table in Dyfneint where 'wine' was being drunk by (A 7) or offered to (B 9) the initiated, the companions, who were partakers of the feast and not beholders only (as in A 1). The candidate Melwas now proceeds to make a voluntary declaration as fol- lows: 'I hate the smile [of scorn] of a grey-haired old man with his sword like a skewer beneath his jaw' [a probable reference to a form of salute, the sword being held horizontal below the chin], 'Who desires but cannot achieve' [implying that he, Melwas, is not one of these]. In making this declaration, he has violated the injunction to silence which had been given to him earlier, and he is conse- quently reproved by Cai the initiator: Still more hateful to me</page><page sequence="10">An Early Ritual Poem in Welsh 47 A proud man, timid, except for words, Who will not cease from speech Nor draw his sword. On receiving this rebuff, the candidate draws his sword, and they exchange blows: he is reproached with being more willing to babble than to fight, and is then put to the test to prove his valor and his worth. The two stanzas at the beginning of B are very suggestive, and may help in the elucidation of the tenor of these two poems. Melwas boasts he rides a good horse,' which fears no water, nor will any man make him turn aside. Gwenhwyvar declares her horse is green, the color of the leaves. It would seem as though we have here an allusion to Melwas in the form of the water divinity riding the animal which is only another form of himself, very suitable whether he belongs to Iceland (according to Geoffrey of Monmouth), to Ireland (as J. F. Bruce maintained), to Islay (according to A. Griscom) or to Glastonbury, all lands sur- rounded by water. In northeastern Scotland, the belief is still held that the kelpie or water spirit in the form of a black horse2 haunts the banks of the rivers waiting for the unwary traveller who wishes to cross. Once he is on his back the horse plunges into the river which thus receives the sacrifice it desires. Like the river Dee, so other Scottish rivers must thus be propitiated: Bloodthirsty Dee Each year needs three: But bonny Doon She needs none. Tweed said to Till, 'What gars ye rin sae still?' Till said to Tweed, 'Though ye rin wi' speed And I rin slaw, Yet whare ye droon ae man I droon twa.' In Scotland also, the river spirit appears in female form, often clad in green and white. May we not therefore see in Gwenhwyvar's reply an allusion to herself as Melwas' counterpart? Her very name 'White Phantom' and her description of her green steed (in Welsh as in Irish glas means 'green,' as in glaswellt, 'green hay, grass': 'blue, as in awyr las, 'blue sky: 'grey,' as in ceffyl glas, 'grey horse'; it is the color of water, mist, humidity), suggest that she, too, was originally a rebirth of one of the nature divinities and a much older figure than Arthur, with whom she is always connected, unless (as is possible) he, too, is a euhemerized version of an older animistic god. Melwas and Gwenhwyvar may thus have had once a different relationship to one another. An echo of this seems to be present in two German versions of the abduction story. In Diu Crone by Heinrich von dem Turlin the abductor Gasozein and in the Lanzelet by Ulrich von Zatzikhoven, Valerin put forward a prior claim of betrothal or prenuptial liaison in justification of the rape. It is noticeable also that when Arthur arrives in Melwas' abode to rescue his Queen she does not seem too eager to leave her captor. 1 Frazer, op. cit., 391. The animal and plant gods tend to become anthropomorphic, but the ani- mals and plants still retain a connection with them. 2 J. M. McPherson, Primive Beliefs in the North-East of Scotland (19Q9), p. 61 ff. Pluto arrives in a chariot drawn by four black horses to carry away Persephone. It should be remembered that the spirits of today are the gods of yester-year.</page><page sequence="11">48 An Early Ritual Poem in Welsh As a water divinity Melwas is the equivalent of Manannan in Irish mythology. Manannan in one story appears as a 'Young Lad' bearing the Silver Branch with nine golden apples, and comes to Tara. His visit is followed by the disappearance of Cormac's wife.' Similarly Melwas, The Noble Youth (who speaks of himself, in both A and B as being 'young') comes to Arthur's court and abducts Gwen- hwyvar. (Are his the 'golden caskets' from the Isle of Apples?) In both instances, Cormac and Arthur are obliged to visit the abductor's home in Tir na n'og and Ynys Wydrin respectively (i.e., the Otherworld), exactly as Orpheus rescues Eurydice carried away by Pluto. In the last number of Folklore (XLVII [1936], 347-361) in an article entitled 'Diarmuid and Grainne', A. H. Krappe contends that while the story of Tristan and Isolt in its oldest parts is a form of the Irish tale of Diarmuid and Grainne, so the latter goes back to that of Adonis and Aphrodite, which is itself a form of the myth of Tammuz and Ishtar. It would seem therefore that we have a parallel again in a form of the Melwas-Gwenhwyvar story which has also been represented in the form of an abduction myth. Probably the original form of the Manawyddan and Rhiannon relationship was similar. Instead of being re- spectably married, he may have sought her in her home and carried her away into that castle enveloped in mist into which they vanished together when they followed the boar, the messenger from the Otherworld. Manawyddan's name is of course Manannan2 influenced by the word manawyd, 'awl,' when he was represented primarily as a divinity of crafts, rather than a water divinity. Manannan, too, is both. He is also a magician, just as Melwas was conceived to be. A Welsh poet, Dafydd ab Edmwnt (fifteenth century) has a reference to this in a poem3 in which he bewails the fact that 'a youth's sigh avails not for me to invoke the art of Melwas, The thief that by magic and illusion Took a fair one to the world's end: to the green wood that juggler went, To the leafy rampart of a bough.' It is therefore possible to see in Melwas the 'youth' stage of the divine king Manawyddan. The original, 0, from which both A and B appear to be ultimately derived, was therefore the dialogue in a mystery ritual in which the neophyte Melwas sought to become initiated into the cult of the goddess represented by Gwen- hwyvar. This aspect of him as the candidate, 'The Noble Youth,' is all the more interesting as he has hitherto been known only as the abductor of Gwenhwyvar, the Welsh counterpart of the dark and gloomy Pluto who abducts Persephone, the spirit of the corn and of vegetation. This is evidently a later conception of Melwas. As his name implies, he is to be equated with the young Adonis, Atys, Tammuz, just as Gwenhwyvar represents Aphrodite, Kybele or Ishtar. In this r6le he has been replaced in later versions of the myth by Lancelot, whose name L'ancelot, too, betrays his origin. Whatever may be the real derivation of the name,4 it was understood to mean 'The Young Server.' Lancelot is thus another candidate for admission into the cult of the goddess, as represented by Guinevere. It will be remembered that it is not until they meet in the land of Goirre, Melea- I Nutt, Studies in the Legend of the Holy Grail, p. 193. 2 Ifor Williams, 'Manawydan, Golydan,' B.B.C.S., iII (1926-27), 49. 3 Rhys, Arth.

Here he suc- ceeds in his desire and is received by her, he is accepted as her 'server,' he enters into the service of his 'Lady.' Now Lancelot had been prepared for this initiation by the Lady of the Lake. With this training we may compare that received by Cuchulain at the court of Scathach (he had to cross a certain bridge before he could reach her), by Peredur at the hands of the witches, and by Pryderi-Gwri in the home of Teyrnon Twryf Vliant (who is the Great King of the Waves,' another form of Manannan); the resemblance between Lancelot and Gwri is even greater in that they were both carried away by unnatural means as babes and cared for from earliest childhood by Otherworld beings. These four heroes all seek initiation into warrior cults, otherwise knighthood. Having been admitted, they are in a position to go forward and seek initiation into higher degrees in the cult of the 'Lady,' which Melwas in the poems under notice is seeking to obtain. An episode in the romance of Perlesvaus2 in which Lancelot is offered a king- dom for a year on condition that he allows himself to be sacrificed by burning at the end of that year may perhaps be best explained as referring to the death of the god and divine king and his resurrection immediately after with the birth of the new year.3 There must therefore have been traditions in which Lancelot too stood to Guinevere as Adonis did to Aphrodite. It is traditions of this nature which lie at the base of Chretien's poem of Lancelot's love for the Queen. They were no doubt contained in the 'sans' or 'matter' which Marie de Champagne gave to Chretien de Troyes when she asked him to compose his romance Le Chevalier de la Charrette.4 It was, however, no guilty passion on the part of Lance- lot which should have been portrayed but the worshipper's adoration of the object of his cult. When in Perlesvaus the Hermit (King Pelles) reproaches Lance- lot with his love for the Queen, declaring that it is this which prevents him from seeing the Grail, he is in reality taxing him with being an adherent of another cult, a secret cult which was opposed to the Christian doctrine which he himself professed. (It is interesting to note that at the beginning of this romance Guine- vere is so far from being interested in Lancelot that she is fearful for Arthur's safety, hence his abstention from knightly deeds!) It is this secret cult, still a living religion in mediaeval times (and in certain respects even today) which is the basis of the so-called love-poetry of the trouba- dours and trouveres, and explains the haughty, distant conduct of the 'Lady' '1a belle dame sans merci,' and the protestations of service on the part of the poet- lover who asked for no reward beyond admittance to her presence and the right to serve her, in other words, initiation into her particular cult, to be attained only by perfect servtce, whether she represented the Greek, Babylonian, Egyp- tian, or Celtic goddess.

In the poetry of the troubadours which we may divide into three periods we have a reflection of a cult or cults of this nature. In the first (and most interesting) period that of the 'trobar clus" we have veiled references to a particular cult of the 'Lady.' The poet strives to be completely identified with his 'Lady.' When the initiate has reached the highest degree, he has attained complete union with the deity, whether god or goddess. This con- ception may lie at the root of some of the many abduction myths. The initiate is so completely absorbed in the object of his adoration that she too, has become entirely his: she is his 'Queen.' Hence Melwas may be represented both as the neophyte seeking initiation and later as the 'abductor' of the 'Queen.' In the second period, the feelings of the poet are more simply and directly ex- pressed: they are of a more secular nature. The object of the poet's homage is generally (although not always even here) the wife of the poet's patron, or she may herself be his patroness. In the third period, the poetry is again of a religious nature, but the Lady addressed has become the Virgin, the Christian representative of the goddess: 'Mater Deorum' has become 'Mater Dei.' We find the same cult again expressed in romance: on the one hand in the epope'e courtoise, the most perfect example being Le Chevalier de la Charrette, although Le Chevalier au Lion also contains more than a hint of it. On the other hand in the Grail romances, all the stories of Perceval, Gawain, Lancelot reflect the striving for admission into a certain cult; here the goddess or the 'Lady' has been replaced by the Grail, itself in certain pagan aspects but a representation of the 'Lady' herself. The clearest references to a ritual of this kind are to be found in the romance of Perlesvaus (the early, preparatory years of the hero's career and his admission to the first- degree, or knighthood, are already contained in Chretien's Conte du Graal). It will be remembered that the hero is known by three names Perlesvaus, Perceval, and Parluifet. A feeble attempt at explaining the first is made by the Widow Lady (P.'s mother - note her name!) who says that Alain le Gros had chosen this name for his son because he wished him to be reminded of their loss of the Valleys of Camelot. Perlesvaus is therefore Pert-les-vaus, 'he loses the valleys.' No ex- planation is offered of the name Perceval: the writer evidently thought the name was sufficiently familiar, and so required none. As Brugger has already suggested, Perceval, like Perceforest and others, is only an epithet.2 For that matter, so were most names originally, and some are still chosen as such. Parluifet is cor- rectly given as 'made of himself.' P.'s sister declares quite definitely and quite rightly that this is not her brother's name - it was not when she was speaking of him, but it is a correct description of him when he is so called by his Hermit uncle, King Pelles, after he recovers from his 'sickness.' It will be recalled that Perlesvaus has failed to ask the 'question' when he was at the Grail castle, and the Fisher King is still 'in languishment' as a result of the failure. Perlesvaus had not yet successfully prepared himself for the final stage when he could be admitted to full knowledge of the secrets of the Grail. I A. Jeanroy, 'La premiere generation des Troubadours,' Romania, LVI (1930), 481-525. 2 ZFSL., XLIV2 (1916-17), 170.</page><page sequence="14">An Early Ritual Poem in Welsh 51 He had passed through the preliminary stages, 'through the vales' of darkness (this is, I believe, the real explanation of the names Per or Parceval, Perlesvaus, a stage which we find reflected in Psalm xxiii, also the hymn of a mastery ritual)' but he had not yet emerged into the light. It was not until he had spent some time in solitude at the hermitage that he was able to 'make himself,' to become 'the perfect man,' one of the Perfecti or Illuminati, and no longer one of the Auditores, a 'worker' and not a 'hearer' only. At the final stage in all mysteries, the candidate must reach the highest plane alone, entirely through his own ef- forts, he must be 'self-made.' Herein we have the meaning of Parluifet, 'made of [by] himself,' 'l'homme parfait,' the perfect (or entirely made) man. It is after this period of seclusion that Perlesvaus, having passed through from darkness to light can be called Parluifet. This explains why Gawain cannot pass the chained lion and the copper men who guard the entrance (Threshold) to the land of the Fisher King. Perlesvaus, or rather Parluifet, has no difficulty when he approaches the Castle of Great Endeavour, in entering this castle which whirls more rapidly than the wind and which is guarded by active copper men and by lions and bears, although neither Lancelot nor Gawain who accompany him are allowed to do so. He is equally successful in entering the Copper Castle, the threshold of which is similarly guarded by men of copper. The threshold of a house, palace, castle is regarded as being sacred among many different peoples and many rites are still connected with it.2 In the mysteries where the Lodge is often represented, as in Perlesvaus, by a castle, the threshold is particularly well guarded: as has been said (p. 49) it corresponds to the Ford or Bridge or Passage in other mysteries. Here the candi- date for admission has to prove his worth by meeting the 'Keeper of the Thresh- old' or the 'Watcher at the Ford' and showing he is at least his equal. We have exactly the same position in the story of Yvain ou le Chevalier au Lion. Here Yvain has to defend himself at the Fountain, which represents the Ford, and overcome the Guardian, before he can gain entrance into the realm of the 'Lady of the Fountain,' the goddess of the spring of life-giving water.3 Yvain is suc- cessful, whereas Calogrenant had failed, like so many others before him. Mr Krappe has suggested that the story of Diarmuid and Grainne and of Tristan and Isolt - we may now add those of Lancelot and Guinevere, of Yvain and Laudine - go back to the East, but it is evident that it was the Celtic form which inspired the French poets. It is to the Irish story as told by the Welshman Blebri that we owe the beautiful and romantic story of Tristan, it is also to a Welsh story of Melwas and Gwenhwyvar that we owe the inspiration of Lance- lot's love for Queen Guinevere. Once again we may say that, were it not for Celtic myth and story, French mediaeval literature, and consequently that of mediaeval and modern Europe, would be infinitely the poorer.
