Press, 1993. ?40.00 There are several arguments and observations contained in this stimulating book, not all of which are as closely inter-linked and coherent as they might be, despite the worthy attempts throughout the book to demonstrate their inter-connectedness. The principal argument, with which I have considerable sympathy, and which is amply documented, is that the British approach to kinship studies, in particular the explicit and implicit reliance on the genealogi- cal method, despite its seeming neutrality as a scientific method, is in fact heavily imbued by English middle-class 'folk' notions of kinship. Consequently, its usefulness as a universally ap- plicable tool for understanding other cultures is severely limited. Central to Bouquet's descrip- tion, both because it substantiates the way in which personal experience influences anthro- pological modelling, and because her own ex- perience teaching anthropology to undergradu- ates in Portugal was the occasion which brought about a reconsideration of the kinship studies to which she had been exposed in Cam- bridge, is a detailed and fascinating comparison of British to Portuguese attitudes to the self and to the person and, by extension, to notions of kin and family. The bewilderment of her Portu- guese students is familiar - many of us will have encountered similar puzzlement when trying in the field to explain with drawings and matchsticks our pursuit of the genealogical method - and I found the examples she pro- vided of specifically Portuguese ways of 'talking</page><page sequence="2">1012 BOOK REVIEWS family' convincing. They illustrated very clearly why eliciting information about kin is not so straightforward a process as it was sometimes said to be in Cambridge. In the final section of the book, in a manner she clearly recognizes may be considered idio- syncratic but one which she stoutly defends, she examines the stories of Beatrix Potter (Peter Rabbit et al.) in order to demonstrate precisely what it is which is unique about the thinking of the English middle-class with respect to notions of self person and role-playing. These stories reveal under her critical probing precisely what these assumptions were which informed the British approach to kinship in which notions of pedigree and blood-line were key elements. Al- though usually well-disposed to the use of fic- tion to get at the controlling ideas of a particu- lar culture, I found the argument here unsatisfactory. A particular point is made, for example, of the difference implied in dressing the animals of the stories in human clothes, thus contributing to an anthropomorphic ren- dering of them, and then divesting them of those clothes in critical circumstances - Peter Rabbit loses his clothes being chased through the cabbage patch - and therein stressing their species character. But this and other similar points, well presented as they were, failed to convince me that in any but a superficial man- ner there was a natural affinity or a cognate re- lationship between Beatrix Potter's stories and WH. River's genealogical method. The strength of Bouquet's argument, leaving the several fascinating linguistic and cultural di- gressions aside for the moment, emerges from her close analysis of the way in which those English assumptions underlying the dominant British kinship studies approach are likely to distort the understanding of the nature of rela- tions between kin in other cultures when such an approach is applied. As she describes it, cit- ing the classical authorities, Rivers, Firth et al., the method requires an abstraction from an in- dividual's pedigree to the drawing up of a gene- alogy which represents, with its diagrams and terminology, a culture's kinship system. This movement of abstraction and objectification, however, which works in accordance with the assumptions of the methodological practice, in- eluctably stresses lineage and descent. For so- cieties where such issues are not so important as, say, the intensity of relations with known and fictive kin, the genealogy is not only arbi- trary and irrelevant, but actually deeply mis- leading as a description of personal relations. This brief summary does not, however, do jus- tice to her arguments, and those who may feel sceptical about whether there is an inherent flaw, of the kind described, in the British ap- proach to kinship are strongly advised to read the detailed analysis. It was arguments and discussions with Portu- guese students and colleagues which brought home to Bouquet the problematic nature of the British approach to kinship. As I have suggested above, several of us have been in similar situ- ations - and are increasingly so - both in the classroom and in our experiences in the 'field'. We should be grateful to her, therefore, for put- ting her finger on the source of at least some of the unease we have felt. C.W WATSON University of Kent</page></plain_text>
