Artist—Sorcerers: Mimicry, Magic and Hysteria David Lomas Mimicry would thus be accurately defined as an incantation fixed at its culminating point and having caught the sorcerer in his own trap.1 'Have you ever observed a love-smitten lyrebird perform its mimetic dance among the ferns?' asked Andre Breton rhetorically in a 1942 essay on Max Ernst, before going on to describe Ernst's adoption of an avian disguise, an alter-ego named Loplop.2 Though the movement he founded eventually reached Australian shores, Breton (notwithstanding his eulogies on the Great Barrier Reef) never did. Hence, it is not surprising that he was slightly confused about the lyrebird. It is not the lyrebird's courtship dance but rather its mimicry of sounds that is the main source of its notoriety. The timid lyrebird lives in dense, remote rainforest where it is more likely to be heard than seen. It has a stupendous vocal repertoire that spans not only the calls of other birds; it has been known to include chainsaws, car alarms, and even mobile phone ring tones. While adept at mimicking all manner of sounds, it has been discovered that the lyrebirds' songs in a particular locality have in common the same arrangement of borrowed sounds, raising the possibility of cultural transmission amongst lyrebirds. For Aristotle, who would not have encountered a love-smitten lyrebird, such a prodigious capacity for imitation is the sole preserve of humankind, and it supplies the basic impulse for poetry. 'Imitation', writes Aristotle in the Poetics, 'comes naturally to human beings from childhood (and in this they differ from other animals, i.e. in having a strong propensity to imitation and in learning their earliest lessons through imitation); so does the universal pleasure in imitations'.3 With the advent of Darwinism, this privilege would no longer belong to man alone. The theory of natural selection found support in the facts of biological mimicry. Though earlier naturalists had described the tendency of animals to adopt the colouration of their surroundings, it was not until 1862 that the naturalist Henry Walter Bates put forward a plausible explanation of mimicry in butterflies as affording protection from predators. Challenges to an anthropocentric worldview emanating from biology both facilitated the extension of the idea of mimesis to nature and, conversely, enabled ideas about mimicry in the natural world to be analogised to human behaviours. Typifying this shift in perspective, the English naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace observed wryly that birds and insects can be so skilled at mimicking the members of other species that they appear to us 'like actors or masqueraders dressed up and painted for amusement, or like swindlers endeavouring to pass themselves off for well known and respectable members of society'. Of this dubious talent for deception, Wallace asks: 'What is the meaning of this strange travestie? Does nature descend to imposture or masquerade?'4 Credit for introducing animal mimicry to a Surrealist milieu is due to Roger Caillois, a young sociologist who published two articles on this subject in the journal Minotaure in 1934 and 1935.5 The focus upon Surrealism as first and © The Author 2012.

While Caillois' essays on insect mimicry certainly have not gone unnoticed in Surrealist scholarship, the implications of mimicry for a comprehension of Surrealism have yet to be fully assessed.6 Caillois, it transpires, was not interested in natural mimicry merely for its own sake, but in relation to specific human propensities for simulation. His postulation of a mimetic instinct in humans as a counterpart to that in animals was based upon evidence drawn eclectically from anthropology, psychopathology, and psychoanalysis. The critic and art historian, Rosalind Krauss, one of only very few commentators to have taken seriously the problematic of mimicry for a reading of the Surrealist image, adduces it in support of her contention that Surreality is 'nature convulsed into a kind of writing'.7 The present Fig. 1.

Artist—Sorcerers: Mimicry, Magic and Hysteria article explores an alternative set of connections among mimicry, magic, and convulsive hysteria. Though concentrating mainly upon Max Ernst who fused these concerns in the notion of a 'convulsive identity', it will also elicit a broader context that includes Salvador Dalí whose profound involvement with natural history and the problems of mimicry and simulation is certainly on a par with Caillois, as well as women Surrealist artists, amongst them Leonora Carrington, Leonor Fini, Toyen, and Remedios Varo, for whom I shall argue that mimicry was the basis for a radical, de-essentialising identity strategy. Mimicry in Nature and Art Le Petit mimétique (Fig. 1), an object assemblage created jointly by Andre Breton with his wife, Jacqueline Lamba, trades on the ambiguity of mimicry as regards the nature-culture divide. It was shown in the Exposition surréaliste d'objets at the Galerie Charles Ratton from 22 to 31 May 1936. The exhibition comprised an extremely heterogeneous assortment of natural objects, found objects, Surrealist objects, and non-Western objects. Amongst the natural objects were carnivorous plants and a stuffed armadillo. Le Petit mimétique is listed in the catalogue as a Surrealist object; though ostensibly an artwork, it looks more like a mounted natural history specimen. A viewer of the show could well have been confused as to which of the categories within the Surrealists' idiosyncratic taxonomy of natural and man-made objects it properly belonged. The title bestowed upon it points to mimicry as its explicit subject. The object, in as far as it dissimulates its status as an artwork, can be said to recruit mimicry as a disruptive cultural strategy.8 One of the aspects of natural mimicry that most intrigued Caillois was its peculiar status as a form of proto-representation. It is as though nature herself were become an artist: Caillois memorably describes the insect that mimics its milieu as a Fig. 2.

In the Romantic period, such ambiguity was valued as a source of the marvellous. Were Breton and Lamba 'little mimics' in creating this work? Certainly, one would have to assign priority to Picasso who in 1932, well before Damien Hirst thought of doing likewise, trapped a real butterfly on a surface that had been covered with cream enamel paint (Fig. 2). The butterfly itself is cream with black markings, with two pairs of eye-spots, and gives the impression of having chosen to alight on a surface, a work of art shall we say, against which it is moderately well camouflaged. Among the other collaged elements in this piece is a decayed leaf whose transparent vein pattern somewhat resembles an insect wing. Caillois points out, in fact, that in their mania to resemble, insects are often not content merely to imitate a whole healthy leaf but will copy all the imperfections, patches of decay caused by parasitic infections, as well. This work was well known to Breton, a keen butterfly collector, since it was reproduced at the head of a major text, 'Picasso in his element', in the first issue of the magazine Minotaure (1933), and it is the subject of enchanted contemplation within the essay. It is telling that no mention was made of mimicry in that text however, tending to confirm that Caillois was directly responsible for kindling his interest in the matter. Natural resemblance, albeit not mimicry per se, features in Breton's definition of convulsive beauty, a core Surrealist concept. The essay 'La beauté sera convulsive' (1934) has a famous eulogy to crystal. In the forms assumed by crystals, Breton discerns a vitalistic principle of growth that spans mineral and living kingdoms. This observation is evidence of a deepening response to German Romanticism that coincides with the increased prominence given to nature and natural imagery within Surrealism. It may be that Breton, who kept abreast of developments in the bio-medical sciences, was aware of the great strides being made in the field of crystallography, allowing scientists to picture the molecular building blocks of life. Breton marvels at the amazing resemblances produced by the growth patterns of crystals: 'here the inanimate is so close to the animate that the imagination is free to play infinitely with these apparently mineral forms, reproducing their procedure of recognizing a nest, a cluster drawn from a petrifying fountain'.10 This statement has been read as an instance of the uncanny, yet we seem to be a long way from any Freudian territory.11 The essay concludes with an image of a sprouting potato that affords a striking similarity to a mask — another example of unmotivated mimesis that escapes rational causality, catching us by surprise and producing a sense of the marvellous. An apt post-face to Breton's article. The various ways in which mimetic resemblance enters into the definition of convulsive beauty resonates with Caillois' essay on the praying mantis in the same issue of Minotaure, which moreover included a half-page essay by Max Ernst on 'Les Mystéres de la forét' (Minotaure, 1934) and a facing page of photographs, suggesting a deliberate orchestration of these texts. Ernst was well primed to respond to Caillois' ideas about mimicry, natural history having long been a source of artistic motifs for him. La Joie de vi vre of 1936 (Fig. 3) belongs to a distinct cluster of works that Ernst produced in 193S and 1936. A dense, jungle-like tangle of vegetation could be read as a forest or a photographic close-up or a museum diorama. The scale is ambiguous; it is like a seething microcosm of nature as a whole. A luxuriant canopy offers protective cover to creatures brimming with anthropomorphic attributes whose erotic games of pursuit and capture played out in the 368 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 9.

There is a degree of conceptual overlap between metamorphosis and mimicry, though one pertains more to myth and the other to biology. Whether human-to-animal transformations are described as metamorphosis or mimicry depends partly on the point of view. undergrowth evoke Ovidian myths of Apollo and Daphne, as well as a more modern parable of the survival of the fittest.12 Disguise and camouflage are key offensive and defensive strategies: in the foreground of La Joie de vivre, a malevolent praying mantis blends imperceptibly with the foliage. Several of the works in this series are actually titled The Nymph Echo, a reference that resonates nicely with the back and forth visual 'echoes' between plants and animals. Ovid relates how Echo was condemned to mimic, repeating the last words spoken and giving back the sounds she has heard. After her amorous entreaties to Narcissus were rejected, she pined away, her body disappearing until only her voice remained. Her bones were turned to stone. This could be seen to confirm the 'instinct of renunciation' to which Caillois ascribes the facts of mimicry, with its ultimate aim a subject's total absorption by its surroundings. Ernst's article on the mysteries of the forest, a title suggestive of a Romantic attitude to nature, concludes with an evocation of the exotic jungles of the Pacific Islands that is consonant with the flavour of this series of works. One is reminded that the facts of biological mimicry were discovered far from Europe in the teeming rainforests of the Amazon and OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 369</page><page sequence="8">David Lomas Malaysia. European naturalists were brought face to face with an indomitable nature — 'wild and impenetrable, black and russet, extravagant... ferocious' in Ernst's words13 — that towered over them, shrinking them and their human purposes to the size of miniscule insects (Fig. 4). The Darwinian explanation of mimicry posits a survival advantage for an organism through protective adaptation to its milieu. Caillois, on the other hand, maintains that mimicry does not confirm, nor conform to, the theory of natural selection. In his rejection of Darwinism, Caillois was not alone in the period, especially in France.14 His main bone of contention is the classical principle of utility to which he saw Darwin as submitting all of nature. Caillois cites evidence that runs counter to the claim that mimicry improves the chance of survival: insects that so resemble the vegetation they forage upon that they mistakenly devour each other in a sort of cannibalistic feast. He concurs with Luden Cuénot that the 'defensive utility [of mimicry] appears to be nul'. Caillois deems mimicry an enigma that defies instrumental logic in serving no useful purpose; it is, he writes, 'a luxury and even a dangerous luxury.'5 Such terminology points to the close correspondence of his views with Georges Bataille, whose theorizing of expenditure is similarly premised on a critique of utility. Writing in Critique sociale, a journal of Marxist sociology, Bataille listed examples of unproductive expenditure: 'luxury, mourning, war, cults, the construction of sumptuary monuments, games, spectacles, arts, perverse sexual activity'.16 We can appreciate a connection too with the superabundant vegetation in Ernst's painting of the mid-1950s. Tangled vines that gobble up airplanes and lay whole cities to entropic waste in the concurrent series La Ville entiére are conceptually pitched against an interwar vision of technological modernity, with an underlying principle of ever-greater efficiency. Breton stated concisely that Ernst stops the stampede of progress dead in its tracks.17 Mimicry is entropic in a manner similar to Bataillean expenditure. It levels distinctions, tending to augment a state of homogeneity that Caillois defines in psychological terms as 'a generalisation of space at the expense of the individual'; he speaks of 'reintegration with original insensibility and prenatal Fig. 4.

Félix Le Dantec, one of the sources cited by Caillois, proposes a reconciliation of Lamarkian and Darwinist explanations of mimicry. He conjectures that at least some cases of mimicry can be explained as 'hereditarily fixed remnants of an originally voluntary imitative faculty'.

Caillois would later on retract this core proposition — mimeticism as a disturbance of space perception and a tendency to return to the inanimate — branding it fantastical.

Caillois discovers in nature not a universal principle of utility, which he objects to because of its anthropocentrism, but rather 'an immense squandering of resources'.19 He refers to this tendency as a veritable law of economics, similar to Bataille's description of a general (versus a restricted) economy. The concept of expenditure they subscribe to is indebted to their mentor, the sociologist Marcel Mauss. Ornamental decoration in nature is superfluous and thus inexplicable in terms of natural selection, asserts Caillois, who gives as examples of pattern making such things as butterfly's wings, crystals, flowers, fish scales, and the skins of certain mammals. (One is reminded of the obsessive attention to textural pattern in Ernst's frottages.) Natural pattern making, an aesthetic impulse not conscious of itself, is, Caillois insists, every bit as useless as painting. In Caillois' vision of a 'mimetic contagion', nature and culture copy one another with neither able to claim precedence over the other. Natural categories are traduced. Not surprisingly, Caillois is led from Surrealism back to pre-modern cabinets of curiosity and collectors whose most prized objects were not typical specimens but odd singularities. Caillois himself was an avid rock collector. Just as a butterfly's wings resemble an abstract painting, he remarks that so too: 'rocks ... supply natural works of art that have such a resemblance to paintings and have so struck the imagination of observers that at times they have been led to think of nature herself as an artist'.20 Referring to Jurgis Baltrusaitis's book Aberrations (1957), Caillois cites a tradition of painting on alabaster and other stones where the wave-like patterns, suggestive of the sea or clouds or hills, served the artist as a background for battles and nautical scenes. The patrons who collected these works made a distinction between minerals that are adapted by an artist (ars adaptavit) and those where the mineral itself presents chance resemblances to a ruined city or to rows of serried rooftops. For the latter, the descriptive categories 'painted by nature' (a natura depicti) or 'natural, with no intervention of art' (a natura sine omni artis ministerio) were coined. Ernst's decalcomania technique has a striking resemblance to these 'automatic' works of art: the thin veils of colour have a crystalline translucency and produce wavy patterns like the veins of alabaster. Decalcomania also existed in 'found' and 'assisted' versions. Breton, with reference to Ernst's painting, evoked a space wherein 'clashed and blended together the shapes of the sidereal bestiary, of germination, of mechanical traction, of blossoming crystals'.21 Who is to say that Baltrusaitis and Caillois, through to a generation of artists active today, would have rediscovered a pre-Enlightenment episteme and its attendant aesthetic modes of wonder, fascination and sorcery were it not for the example of Surrealism? Mimicry and Masquerade Caillois' 1935 Minotaure article would provoke an extended commentary by Jacques Lacan in the seminar 'What is a Picture?' For Lacan, insect mimicry affords an allegory for the ways in which subjectivity is enmeshed in an imaginary structure that he terms the scopic field: 'in the scopic field, the gaze is outside, I am looked at, that is to say, I am a picture'.22 The function of mimicry is emblematic of a split between a semblance, which the subject presents to the other in a field of relations determined as display or defence, and being itself: 'the being gives of himself, or receives from the other, OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 371</page><page sequence="10">David Lomas something that is like a mask, a double, an envelope, a thrown-off skin'. Lacan reveals his distrust of the realm of the imaginary in his claim that the human subject avoids capture ('captation') by the mask owing to a capacity to play with it: Only the subject - the human subject, the subject of the desire that is the essence of man - is not, unlike the animal, entirely caught up in this imaginary capture. He maps himself in it. How? In so far as he isolates the function of the screen and plays with it. Man, in effect, knows how to play with the mask as that beyond which there is the gaze. The screen is here the locus of mediation.23 It is surprising to find Lacan apparently defending man's special privilege on the grounds of his capacity for reflexive self-consciousness. Nevertheless, these views were taken up and given a feminist slant by Luce Irigaray, who asserted that: 'To play with mimesis is thus, for a woman, to try to recover the place of her exploitation by discourse, without allowing herself to be simply reduced to it. It means ... to make "visible", by an effect of playful repetition, what was supposed to remain invisible'.24 The concept of a gender masquerade, of gender as a performance, expounded in the interwar period by psychoanalysis, has informed the postmodern critique of gender essentialism. Joan Riviere's seminal article, 'Womanliness as a Masquerade' (1929), reported the case of a woman academic who, after proficiently delivering a public lecture, would assuage anxiety about having usurped a male professional role by acting in a Fig. 5.

Artist—Sorcerers: Mimicry, Magic and Hysteria flirtatious, stereotypically female manner towards the men in her audience. Riviere conjectures that for this woman femininity itself 'could be assumed and worn as a mask'. Extrapolating from this patient to the nature of femininity in general, Riviere's far-reaching conclusions have been much cited in arguments against essentialist notions of gender: The reader may now ask how I define womanliness or where I draw the line between genuine womanliness and the masquerade. My suggestion is not, however, that there is any such difference; whether radical or superficial, they are the same thing.25 It was the analysis of hysterical phantasies that first revealed to Freud the lability of gender identifications and suggested to him the idea of a universal bisexuality.26 New psychoanalytic theories of femininity and homosexuality during the 1920s such as Riviere's develop their accounts of gender from this starting point. Indeed, the theorising of gender masquerade is one of the forms in which hysteria lives on after its spectacular fall from grace in a medical arena in the first decade of the 1900s. Such theories have been viewed as a counterpart to the avant-garde strategies of cross-dressing and gender bending that emerged at this time, both within and outside the Surrealist fold, among artists and photographers that included Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, and Claude Cahun.27 For our purposes, it is relevant to note that natural mimicry, in the vivid description of Alfred Russel Wallace, was a sort of transvestism — a brazen imposture perpetrated by nature — and thus alongside hysteria it afforded another pillar of support for Surrealism's 'convulsive' identity. With mimicry its overt subject, Remedios Varos Mimetismo (1960) (Fig. 5), shown here in a precise study for the picture, is indicative of the recourse by various women Surrealist artists to mimicry as a Je-essentialising identity move. The female sitter, evidently a surrogate for the artist, is like a camouflaged insect infiltrated by the ßeui de lys pattern of the upholstered chair upon which she rests. An exchange of properties occurs between the impassive figure and her highly animated milieu. Varo was introduced to the Paris Surrealist group in 1934, the very year of the publication of Caillois' essay on the praying mantis. Of more immediate relevance to the genesis of Mimetismo, Caillois was the co-author of a major study of Varo's painting, not published until 1966, though the material for it evidently had been collected before her untimely death in 1963, as it contains extended personal commentaries by the artist on her pictures. It seems probable that the contact between Varo and Caillois around this time inspired her overt reprise of the mimicry theme. The enormous prestige in Latin America of the Argentinian physician and savant, José Ingenieros, whose La simulación en la lucha por la vida (1904) went through numerous editions from the time of its first publication, is also to be borne in mind. Caillois was resident in Buenos Aires from 1939 until the end of the war, returning to France in 194S, and it is very likely that an awareness of Ingenieros's wide-ranging work contributed to the prominence of simulation as a concern in his later writings. Varo herself commented on this picture: This woman is lost in her thoughts and has remained motionless for so long that she is turning into the armchair, her flesh has become just like the cloth on the chair and her hands and feet are already turned into wood, the furniture gets bored and the armchair bites the table, the chair in the background investigates what the drawer contains, and the cat, which went out to hunt, is frightened and astonished upon returning as he sees the transformation.28 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 373</page><page sequence="12">David Lomas While the passivity of the figure and her absorption into the space might be thought to bespeak feelings of domestic entrapment, as Janet Kaplan points out, Varo, who rejected a conventional female role, evidently saw in the adoption of 'protective coloration' a potential for resistance. Mimicry as a feminist identity strategy is slyly subversive of cultural and social codes. While the proverbial cat was hunting, the mice are left to play ... and havoc reigns. The wardrobe is not a symbol of confinement but a repository of clouds and dreams of escape. It would be a mistake, therefore, to regard the impassivity of the figure as signifying resignation, or even desolation, and thence as a barometer of Varo's supposed mood at the time. Some five years earlier, in The Useless Science or The Alchemist (195S), a similarly isolated figure sweeps up the chequered floor pattern as a protective cloak and there are numerous other instances from this period where camouflage and disguise are consequent upon the exchange of properties between the figure and wooded natural settings. As an identity strategy common to female Surrealist artists, mimetism is conspicuous in the work of Toyen and has been explored in relation to Francesca Woodman, whose photographic practice is recognised as having been profoundly influenced by Surrealism.29 To the foregoing artists, one can add the name of the redoubtable Salvador Dali. In his autobiography, The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí (1942), Dalí claimed modestly to have discovered at the age of 9 not only the secret of mimesis, but also a theory to explain it — a dubious claim to precedence, since by 1942 he had assuredly read Caillois' writings on the subject.30 Indeed, Caillois in his Minotaure essay explicitly links Dali's penchant for double and reversing images with the phenomenon of mimicry. While Dalí may be suspected of re-writing history on this point, there can be no doubt about his profound interest in natural history. The artist recalls his enchantment as a child when he discovered tiny leaf insects of the species Phyllomorphia lacinata on a certain bush that grows in profusion on the coast of Cadaqués. After this discovery, Dalí would put on demonstrations in which, to the delight of his audience, leaves would come to life and march about on a tabletop until a knock on the table would stop them dead in their tracks. Dalí christens the mimetic insect morros de cony, a Catalan slang phrase (literally 'cunt lips') that has the meaning of a deception. He claims that his discovery of one of the sensational secrets of nature influenced the development of the paranoiac and invisible images that later on populate his painting, which is exactly as Caillois had argued.31 The invisible bust of Voltaire is analogous, Dalí asserts, to the leaf insect 'rendered invisible by the resemblance and the 32 confusion established between Figure and Background'. He also recalls seeing camouflaged warships and making a connection with the defensive mimicry of the same leaf insect. Some of these ideas are developed in an essay 'Total Camouflage for Total War' (1942), roughly contemporaneous with The Secret Life. There Dalí remarks that: 'Thus we might say that reality playing at illusion, becomes illusion; and being illusion — and therefore invisible — can serve equally well as a mechanism of defence or offence'.33 That illusion might predominate over reality is something Dalí had long ago proclaimed as the goal of his paranoiac-critical method. (The British Surrealist, Roland Penrose, who partook of a similar passion for butterflies, was the author of a wartime manual on camouflage.)34 There is a hint, moreover, that illusion might be the basis of a personal identity strategy that, returning to The Secret Life, is rendered explicit in the following paragraph where Dalí makes a connection with his own penchant for disguise: mimicry, he infers, supplies the model for a fictive, 374 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 29.

Declaring that 'disguise was one of my strongest passions as a child', he goes on to describe an occasion when he stood in front of a mirror, naked apart from a crown and cape that were a gift from his parents.35 One can scarcely imagine a more perfect illustration of what Lacan terms the mirror stage, the jubilant assumption of a self-image by 'His Majesty' the ego. The mirror stage hypothesis is introduced by Lacan in part to elucidate the mechanism whereby the ego coalesces as a discrete, unified entity, which Lacan considered to be an imaginary unity. Lacan's explanation drew upon Caillois' account of the subject's mimetic capture ('captation') by an image external to it. In his recounting the above episode, Dalí alludes to 'representations of the "ego"' of which it afforded him a compelling illustration. Another significant detail of this childhood memory is that, as he stood before the mirror, Dali squeezed his genitals between his thighs in order that he might appear as much as possible like a woman. At the tender age of 9, Dalí had discovered that the performance of gender is a masquerade and he had in mimicry a fully fledged theory to explain it! Fig. 6.

OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 37S</page><page sequence="14">David Lomas Dalí returned once more to the subject of mimicry in 1953 in the American fashion and lifestyle magazine Flair, edited by Fleur Cowles, where he predicted that the next season's fashion would be for mimesis in feminine apparel: Now I feel a period coming for leaf-women, stick-women, autumnal-wood-women. For owl-women who will also be butterflies, and butterflies that will also be rocks. Women who will disappear into the trees, who will disintegrate on a patch of moss, and whose silhouette will be of thorns tender as roses - roses transparent as a Lalique dragon.36 In point of fact, such a fad was already well underway at the time of writing. Might Dalí have known about a 1951 publication showing the Surrealist artist Leonor Fini wearing her hand-sewn bird masks?37 The format of Dali's article recalls children's cutout books: as the pages are turned, a woman's eyes become eye-spots on the wings of a butterfly that metamorphose into an owl woman. The tongue-in-cheek tone of the article does not obscure the fact that Dalí discerned a link between mimicry, fashion, and children's play that would be elaborated in a more serious academic vein by Caillois. Confirming the intuition of the artist, Caillois writes in The Mask oj the Medusa that 'in the case of man, fashion is also a phenomenon of mimicry, of an obscure contagion of fascination with a model that is imitated for no real &gt; 38 reason . Mimicry and Magic Max Ernst's adoption of Loplop (Fig. 6) as an alter-ego extends our consideration of mimicry to a set of concerns with myth and magic that arose in the wake of Andre Breton's call in the Second Manifesto (1930) for the 'occultation of Surrealism' and that grew stronger during the later 1930s in response to the growing crisis in Europe. Breton's essay, 'The Legendary Life of Max Ernst preceded by a brief discussion of the need for a new myth', was written during his wartime exile in New York for a special issue of the magazine View devoted to the artist in April 1942. Attesting to his preoccupation with myth, the catalogue of the International Surrealist Exhibition in New York in 1942, titled First Papers of Surrealism, featured an album by Breton, 'On the Survival of Certain Myths and on Some Other Myths in Growth or Formation'. This album concluded with Breton's myth of the 'grands transparents' ('great invisibles'), beings that avail themselves of a sort of camouflage. The same year, the results of an inquiry were published in another Surrealist journal VVV, 'Concerning the Present-day Relative Attractions of Various Creatures in Mythology and Legend'. Ernst, we are told, is a kindred spirit with another inhabitant of Cologne from four centuries before, the 'arch-sorcerer' Cornelius Agrippa.39 An autobiographical timeline, 'Some Data on the Youth of M.E. as told by himself, compiled by Ernst for the View special issue, confers upon himself a mythical origin and alludes to the possession of supernatural powers. The artist we are told hatched from an eagle's nest over which the mother had brooded for three years.40 Ernst's notes also contain an invocation of Agrippa, evidencing a degree of co-ordination in the self-presentation as a magician or shaman, a construction that subtends Leonora Carrington's essay in the same issue.41 All these point to common ground with the ethnographic leanings of the Bataillean dissident Surrealists, to whom the opening section of Breton's essay on Ernst refers with a gibe at 'these gentlemen of the College de sociologie who are kicking up such a rumpus in 376 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 36.

A meeting of minds between these onetime bitter rivals on the subject of myth would culminate in its adoption as the overarching theme of the 1947 International Exhibition of Surrealism. After invoking Saint-Médard and Loudun, Breton proceeds to imagine Ernst in his Loplop persona as a time traveller. The vulture that Freud's study of Leonardo da Vinci had revealed lurking in the drapery of the Virgin and Child with Saint Anne (1S08), Breton informs us is already Loplop who proceeds to take flight: 'After a few majestic manoeuvres ... he swoops down towards the mountains of Tibet where we see him reappear as a gold-spangled god between the six arms of his shakti ,42 There, Breton reports, men 'endowed with the wings of asceticism', i.e. religious initiates, are said to cover astonishing distances along narrow mountain paths, a piece of information he gleaned from Alexandra David-Néel's popular Mystiques et magiciens du Tibet (1929) which contains an account of Tibetan shamans.43 Breton, whose extensive collection of non-Western art included several Tibetan objects, returned once again to the subject of Tibetan shamanism in L'Art magique (19S7): The extreme dilution of the character of the shaman, at the same time neurotic, medicine-man and (sometimes) official sorcerer of his tribe, probably extended its shadow on pre-Hellenic oracles via Thrace, on Babylonia, and more certainly on Tibet. It achieved there the inextricable mixture of magic and Buddhism that now radiates from the 'roof of the world' onto almost all the peoples of Northern Asia.44 In an interview with Gilles Lapouge, Caillois recalled that shamanism and magic were among subjects discussed at the College of Sociology.45 Two lectures on shamanism were delivered by Russian-born Anatole Lewitzky who joined the Musée de l'Homme in 1933 and was preparing a doctorate on Siberian shamanism under the supervision of Marcel Mauss and Rene Grousset. It was an interest Caillois shared with Bataille, but with the crucial difference that Bataille wished to become a shaman whereas Caillois chose to preserve a more academic detachment.46 This also coincides with Bataille's attempts to access states of ecstasy and is reflected in a conception of himself as the sorcerer's apprentice. One can discern a similar impetus in Ernst's work from as early as 1927: the Bride of the Wind series intimates that the artist consorts with untamed chthonic forces of nature. Descriptions of himself and of Loplop intimate an alliance with darkly malevolent powers. In this period, Bataille and Breton are united in lamenting the loss of a mythic world-view. Bataille's essay, 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice', states that 'the total world of myth, the world of being, is separated from the dissociated world by the very limits that separate the sacred from the profane' ,48 It is intriguing to speculate about the consequences of Levi-Strauss's presence among the Surrealists in New York from 1941, and especially his friendship with Breton and Ernst.49 In 'The Sorcerer and his Magic', an article published in Les Temps modernes in 1949, Lévi-Strauss defined a magico-social system, a 'shamanistic complex', and it is this structure, he argued, that assures belief in the efficacy of magic. This was an intervention into a long-standing debate over the relative proportion of sincerity versus simulation in shamanistic practices.50 Caillois' essay, 'Mimicry and Legendary Psychasthenia,' was published in 1935. In 1933, he attended classes by Marcel Mauss and Georges Dumézil at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes. Referencing Mauss's classic study, A General Theory of Magic, the essay makes a series of highly significant moves from mimicry to magic — significant in terms of Caillois' subsequent OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 377</page><page sequence="16">David Lomas Fig. 7.

Courtesy The Bridgeman Art Library. trajectory and for a comprehensive reading of Ernst. Disputing the scientific consensus that biological mimicry confers a survival advantage, as noted above, Caillois offers a counter-example in the genus Phyllium whose members browse upon their own kind, mistaking them for real leaves, 'the simulation of the leaf being a provocation to cannibalism in this kind of totem feast' Caillois writes evocatively.51 In his later writings, Caillois employs the terms mimicry and simulation more or less interchangeably, asserting in Man, Play and Games (1958), that mimetism is 'the insect equivalent of human games of simulation'.52 The next section of his essay compares the sort of resemblance found in mimicry to sympathetic magic, the belief that 'like produces like' (attractio similium). Sympathetic magic attests to a human tendency to imitate, as well as a belief in the effectiveness of the imitation; it reveals a propensity for discovering resemblance that is far from being restricted to the primitive mind. On the basis of psychological evidence from studies of schizophrenia, Caillois attributes the mimetic impulse to a desire on the part of the organism to be assimilated to space, something he would later on reject as fantastical. Pursuing the analogy between mimicry and magic, he comes up with a provocative formula: 'Mimicry would thus be accurately defined as an incantation Jixed at its culminating point and having caught the sorcerer in his own trap'. In Man, Play and Games, Caillois extends his analysis of shamanism and its relationship to animal mimicry. The revelation that marks out an individual as a future shaman typically occurs during the course of an epileptic fit. Dramatic convulsions and ecstatic states also regularly figure in the shamanic rituals that are performed for the benefit of an audience, as a result of which, Caillois states, the shaman may be considered as a 'professional hysteric'. Caillois insists upon the element of sham in shamanism. However, the crucial point that he retained from Mauss concerns the social efficacy of magic, which is actually enhanced rather than diminished by the pretence. 378 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 51.

Artist—Sorcerers: Mimicry, Magic and Hysteria The audience is complicit in the make-believe, displaying a mixture of gullibility and simulation that recalls children's games: As for mimicry, writes Caillois, it is illustrated in his pantomimes, when possessed. He imitates the cries and behavior of supernatural animals that he reincarnates. He crawls along the ground like a snake, roars and runs on all fours like a tiger, simulates the plummetings of a duck, or waves his arms as if they were a bird's wings. On rare occasions he wears animal masks, but the feathers and head of the eagle or owl, In which he is dressed, enable him to fly magically up to the heavens. Next, despite a costume weighing more than thirty pounds because of the iron ornaments sewed into it, he leaps into the air to show that he is flying very high.53 In his classic study of magic, Mauss had maintained that magicians are often marked out by a nervous or hysterical disposition, which, in his view, was responsible for the so-called stigmata diaboli — areas of absent sensation — that would reveal a witch. Magic ceremonies were often 'accompanied by nervous trances, hysterical crises, even cataleptic fits'. Mauss also remarked upon the admixture of semblance and reality in such rituals, noting that: 'The magician falls into a state of ecstasy, often naturally induced but more usually feigned'.54 Certain aspects of Mauss's account clearly resonate with Ernst's Loplop. The idea of a temporary death is a common theme in magical and religious initiations; the novice, it is believed, actually dies in order to be reborn as a shaman. Ernst, for his part, avers that his life was extinguished at the outbreak of World War I and that he was resuscitated only when it had ended 'as a young man aspiring to become a magician and to find the myth of his time'.55 Mauss notes that magicians were thought capable of defying gravity, writing that: 'He is an expert in levitation and can betake himself anywhere he wishes in a thrice'.56 Animal metamorphosis is another prominent feature of magic rituals. Mauss makes the point that European witches often had a favourite animal they would change into — a mare, a frog, a cat, etc. References to witches, to the Sabbath, and to animal metamorphosis abound in Ernst and certain other Surrealists.57 In Rere d'une petite filie qui voulut entrer au Carmel (1930), the second of the collage novels, the mother superior sees herself in the form of a wolf, flying through space with the rapidity of words. Among the factors bolstering the prestige of magicians, Mauss writes, are 'those mythical and fantastical elements which feature in myths, or rather in a society's oral traditions which are generally recounted in the form of legends, fairy tales or romances'.58 Becoming Animal Within a Surrealist milieu, the German art critic Carl Einstein introduced a novel interpretive framework derived from ethnographic theories of totemism in an essay on Andre Masson, of which Ernst may have been aware.59 With certain qualifications, the ethnological framework elaborated by Einstein is transferable to thinking about Ernst's animal identifications and the themes of metamorphosis with which his work, like Masson's, is replete. Einstein discerns in Masson's work the reversion to a mythological style of creation in which descriptive mimesis is supplanted by psychological determination. He likens Masson to a religious devotee concentrating inwardly in order to attain a state of ecstasy. The artist abandons himself to a dynamic flow that emanates from a mental substratum beneath consciousness. The artwork resulting from this spontaneous drawing, from which all imitative depiction is expunged, comprises a sort of psychogramme.60 Einstein OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 379</page><page sequence="18">David Lomas here paraphrases the Bretonian definition of psychic automatism, but the novelty of his account lies in the suggestion that an altered state of consciousness equivalent to a trance is responsible for triggering a hallucinatory succession of images: It is also possible to let oneself be carried along by the flow of dynamisms: in this way one arrives at a psychogram (spontaneous writing). And one endeavours to match the speed of the psychological process. In the haste to achieve figuration, the ordered structure of space is renounced. There is no externality to the psychogram.61 The blank canvas aids this ecstatic meditation. Einstein contends that discrete objects depicted in this pictorial field are comparable with symptoms that attain meaningfulness from their connection with the underlying psychological process. He sees in Masson's work a collapse of subject and object brought about by a process akin to totemic identification.62 Einstein understands totemism as the counterpart to a psychological regression — an understanding that is clearly predicated, in part, on Freud. He describes the tableau as inciting this process of identification through a sort of contagion, a dispersal of self that culminates in the obliteration of the ego. Noting the ritual use of masks and clothing to heighten a resemblance with the totem object, Einstein states that the ego exits the body of the ecstatic and enters into an animal, a stone or a plant. 'It is precisely this practice, this ecstatic training that Masson has brought to perfection' ,63 The theme of metamorphosis is probably one of the most ancient dramatic motifs, Einstein says, citing as a primitive prototype the example of animal pantomimes and masked dances. These dramas celebrate the acquisition of magical forces accomplished by the sacrifice of an animal. Einstein touches upon a theme that was a major preoccupation of those associated with the journal Documents, including Masson. It is through the projective identification with an animal whilst in an ecstatic state, Einstein suggests, that the sacrifice of oneself is attained. Einstein contends that this schema lies at the origin of figures of religious mediation — a clear allusion, it would seem, to practices of shamanism. And it is in these same terms that he seeks to account for the fish-men, wounded birds, and animals composed of foliage in Masson's painting. Einstein's reading of Masson's imagery as staging a self-sacrifice coincides with Bataille's views about art as expressed, for example, in an essay on Van Gogh. Moreover, it underlines once more the proximity of the Bataillean group to the orthodox Surrealists at this point, since it accords quite closely with Dali's notion of the artwork as producing an ecstatic state akin to hysteria.64 In nineteenth-century medicine, hallucinations (deliria) and ecstasy were all considered part of the capacious tableau of hysterical symptoms. Though no longer current in medicine in the 1930s, hysteria having fallen into disrepute, these concepts plainly had a longer half-life in other disciplinary fields such as anthropology, and of course among the Surrealists. Under the heading 'Memories of a Sorcerer', Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus refer to a 'power of the anomalous' associated with what is termed by them a 'becoming-animal'. What these authors have to say about sorcery and the becoming-animal can help to pinpoint what was at stake for Surrealism in adapting totemism and shamanism as models for convulsive identity. The sorcerer, Deleuze and Guattari write, has a conspiratorial relation of alliance with the demon as the power of the anomalous. The 380 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 61.

Artist—Sorcerers: Mimicry, Magic and Hysteria Inquisitions served Church and State authorities as a means to suppress peasant movements that were accused of subversive pacts with the devil and other elements of sorcery. Alliance, they say, still retains a dangerous and contagious power. Deleuze and Guattari invoke an idea of contagion, which they oppose to filiation (a family name, property rights, etc.). Antecedents for the notion of a mimetic contagion are to be found in Gustave Le Bon's writings on crowd psychology and in early anthropological theories of sympathetic magic.65 Updating these concepts of contagion with reference to viral replication, Deleuze and Guattari write: 'We oppose epidemic to filiation, contagion to heredity, peopling by contagion to sexual reproduction'.66 In a similar fashion, we can see Surrealist artists' animal alter-egos as improper identities that are not reproduced vertically in a line of descent from father to son but that spread laterally by contagion. The becoming-animal through contagion entails the conjugation of disparate elements to form an assemblage: 'These multiplicities with heterogeneous terms, cofunctioning by contagion, enter certain assemblages-, it is there that human beings effect their becomings-animals'.67 Assemblage is a term with a solid avant-garde artistic pedigree. Loplop has precisely this hybrid, metamorphic, assemblage (or collage) character, as do the animal identifications of Carrington, Toyen, and other members of the Surrealist group. Chiming with Ernst's stock imagery from the late 1920s of invading hordes, herds of wild horses, flocks of doves, and such like, Deleuze and Guattari state that: 'becoming-animal always involves a pack, a band, a population, a peopling, in short, a multiplicity'.68 It is tempting to conclude that convulsive identity and becoming-animal are equivalent. Max Ernst's Convulsive Identity As already intimated, one has to see an interest in magic as compatible with Ernst's longer-standing preoccupation with hysteria, dating back to the early 1920s, and building upon it. Affording a dramatic illustration of this convergence, and of its fateful repercussions, is a childhood memory recounted by Ernst in his autobiographical notes: One of his best friends, a most intelligent and affectionate pink cockatoo, died in the night of January the 5th [1906]. It was an awful shock to Max when he found the corpse in the morning and when, at the same moment, his father announced to him the birth of his sister Loni. The perturbation of the youth was so enormous that he fainted. In his imagination he connected both events and charged the baby with extinction of the bird's life. A series of mystical crises, fits of hysteria, exaltations and depressions followed. A dangerous confusion between birds and humans became encrusted in his mind. Ernst described this event as his 'first contact with occult, magic and witchcraft &gt; 69 powers . Ernst was at pains to stress that 'this phantom [Loplop] remained inseparable from another — Perturbation, my Sister: The Hundred Headless Woman'70; inseparable, in other words, from the female hysteric. The confusion of identity that Ernst is prey to is an example of hysterical identification, discussed by Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams and at greater length in Chapter VII of Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego. Apropos the above incident, Freud observes that: 'Identification with an object that is renounced or lost, as a substitute for that object — introjection of it into the ego — is indeed no longer a novelty to us. A process of the kind may sometimes be OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 381</page><page sequence="20">David Lomas directly observed in small children'.71 Freud proceeds to relate the example of a child 'who was unhappy over the loss of a kitten [and] declared straight out that now he himself was the kitten, and accordingly crawled about on all fours, would not eat at table, etc.'72 Clinical facts like this indisputably show the persistence of totemic beliefs in the mental life of children; similarly, in the neuroses, Freud concedes that Jung 'had excellent grounds for his assertion that the mythopoeic forces of mankind are not extinct, but that to this very day they give rise in the neuroses to the same psychical products as in the remotest past ages'.73 As a further example of the return to totemism, Freud refers to the ambivalent attitude of little Hans towards his phobic animal. Hans was initially afraid of being bitten by a horse, which Freud interprets as a fear of castration displaced from the father, the real source, onto the totem animal. As soon as his anxiety began to lessen as a result of the treatment however, the child 'identified himself with the dreaded creature: he began to jump about like a horse and in his turn bit his father'.74 While this might be judged relevant to the emotional ambivalence that attaches to the Loplop character in Ernst's work, alternately fearful or benign, of greater interest apropos of Ernst is the intriguing case of little Arpád's poultry perversion. Arpad had the misfortune to be pecked at by a fowl when he tried to micturate into a fowl-house. 'A year later, when he was back in the same place, he himself turned into a fowl; his one interest was in the fowl-house and in what went on there and he abandoned human speech in favour of cackling and crowing'.75 Simultaneously, Ernst's reading of Totem and Taboo would have reinforced the idea of the artist as a magician. It is not for nothing that people speak of 'the magic of art' and consider the artist as a magician, writes Freud, since among the original functions of art, 'we may suspect the presence of many magical purposes'.76 As noted, hysterical phantasies afforded evidence of the lability of identity and its dependence on performative enactment. Not only may the hysterical symptom represent a compromise between a libidinal and a repressing impulse, suggests Freud, 'it may also represent a union of two libidinal phantasies of an opposite sexual character'.77 The combination of masculine and feminine impulses in a single hysterical symptom affords evidence of an innately bisexual disposition that is especially visible in psycho-neurotics. Freud refers to hysterical attacks in which the patient appeared to play both male and female parts in a sexual phantasy. In one case which he observed, 'the patient pressed her dress up against her body with one hand (as the woman), while she tried to tear it off with the other (as the man)'.78 This case was reported in a letter of 22 December 1897 to Wilhelm Fleiss, a source of Freud's views about an innately bisexual disposition. In a subsequent letter to Fleiss, of 1 August 1899, we find the astonishing claim: 'Bisexuality! I am sure you are right about it. And I am accustoming myself to regarding every sexual act as an event between four individuals'. It is important to underline that Freud's theory of universal bisexuality found crucial support from the study of hysteria. Ernst's subversive alliance with his 'sister', the hysteric, allowed him to indulge in just such a cross-gendered play of identity. The kinship Ernst implies between himself and the female hysteric is borne out by a visual correspondence between Loplop and the airborne hysterics of Une Semaine de bonté (1934), holding out the possibility of an exchange, or trading of places, between them. It is usual for shamans to identify with the spirits of birds and flight is routinely associated with their rituals. Ernst's adoption of the Loplop persona is linked via metaphors of flight to states of 382 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 71.

'I had predicted to his father', Freud confides, 'that it would be possible to trace back Hans' phobia to thoughts and wishes occasioned by the birth of his baby sister.' Note also Hans's runaway phantasy. 75. Freud, Totem and Taboo, pp. 190—91. The case was reported by Ferenczi. 76. Freud, Totem and Taboo, p. 149.

(Photo: BNF, Paris.) insanity: Freud speaks of a 'flight into illness', whilst in idiomatic usage the madman is described as 'away with the birds'. In dreams, the motif of flying or floating can express a wish 'to be like a bird' and often has a grossly sensual character, Freud writes.79 Pursuing the analogy between dreams and hysteria, he adds that: 'Alongside of flying and floating in the air are to be put the gymnastic feats of boys in hysterical attacks, etc.' Realising his ambition to be like a bird allows Ernst to defy gravity — and, we can add, the father's Law.80 The hysteric's refusal to conform to a principle of identity serves as an inspiration for his own revolt: 'IDENTITE SERA CONVULSIVE OU NE SERA PAS' proclaimed Ernst. This was less a reference to Breton and his pet doctrine of convulsive beauty than it was a homage to the convulsive hysteric. A propensity for transgender switching is another feature of shamanism that may explain why Loplop is represented with female breasts and hermaphroditic genitalia. In societies that practice shamanism, Mauss claimed that it is not uncommon for the shaman to dress and assume the attributes of the opposite sex.81 T.K. Oesterreich's Possession, Demoniacal and Other (1927), a publication that is likely to have attracted the Surrealists' attention, underlines the association of hysteria and shamanism. Oesterreich surveys the historical literature on Loudun and other outbreaks of possession in early modern Europe, whilst devoting two full chapters to shamanism. His study is indebted to the Salpétriére School, which in the 1880s reinterpreted these historical episodes of possession as hysterical in nature. Oesterreich regarded these phenomena as having in common the factor of suggestion and auto-suggestion. In his classic book, Le Chamanisme et les techniques archai'ques de 1'extase (1951), Mircea Eliade cites an anthropological tradition of which he is critical that found evidence in shamans of so-called arctic hysteria, variously attributed to the harsh OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 383</page><page sequence="22">David Lomas Fig. 9.

A neuropathic tendency was supposedly betrayed by epileptic fits, anaesthesias, and hallucinations. Ake Ohlmarks, one of the last investigators to subscribe to this view, argued that the shamanic ecstasy was a form of cataleptic trance.82 To an extent, the cross-cultural comparisons of authors such as Oesterreich are anticipated in Bernard Picart's Histoire genérale des Ceremonies, Moeurs, et Coutumes Religieuses de Tous les Peuples du Monde (Paris, 1808). A typical Enlightenment figure in his aspiration to universality, Picart was the first to bring together the convulsionaries of Saint-Médard with the shamans of so-called primitive cultures (Fig. 8). We ought not to overlook Nietzsche as an additional source for Ernst's views about art as a realm of freely assumed pretence. Nietzsche absorbed ideas from Darwin and Malthus about the role of mimicry and disguise in the struggle for survival. For Heraclitus, whom Nietzsche considered a kindred spirit, nature delights in hiding herself. Whilst full of derision for what he saw as an 384 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 3S.3 2012 82.

Emile Benveniste writes that 'empirical events have reality for the analyst only in and by "discourse" which confers on them the authenticity of experience, without regard for their historical reality, and even (one must say: above all) if the discourse evades, transposes or invents the biography the subject gives of themself.'

(© The Trustees of the British Museum.) unquenchable human urge to be deceived, dressed up hypocritically as a quest for truth, Nietzsche viewed art as a realm where make-believe is redeemed. In 'Truth and Lying in a Non-Moral Sense', an essay that tackles these questions most directly, Nietzsche declares of the artistic way of life: 'Whatever the intellect now does, all of it, compared with what it did before, bears the mark of pretence, just as what it did before bore the mark of distortion ... all the expressions of a life lived thus are accompanied by pretence, by the denial of neediness, by the radiance of metaphorical visions, and indeed generally by the immediacy of deception'.83 In a more or less direct allusion, Ernst's autobiography, a palimpsest woven of myth, fantasy, and biographical fact, is sub-titled 'Tissue of Truth, Tissue of Lies'. The constitutive role of a narrative which so patently mingles fact with fantasy, and where this story (histoire) is subjected to continual rewriting — owing to which there exist not a single version but several, each differing slightly from the others — is profoundly analogous to the work of psychoanalysis, which proposed to artists such as Ernst a new, more subjective kind of truth.84 Max Ernst, together with Leonora Carrington, Salvador Dali, Paul Delvaux, and seven other modern artists, was invited to submit a picture on the subject of the temptation of Saint Anthony for a competition in 1946. The winning entry, selected by a panel of judges consisting of Alfred Barr, Marcel Duchamp, and Sidney Janis, would feature in a movie directed by Albert Lewin based on Guy de Maupassant's The Private Affairs of Bel Ami. The eleven works were sent on a yearlong exhibition tour of the United States and Europe. Ernst's winning entry (Fig. 9) is the culmination of his decade-long preoccupation with themes of mimicry.

One might suspect a debt to Henry Fuseli's The Nightmare (1781) (Fig. 10), as well as references to Bosch and other exponents of fantastic art, the latter a category connected with Surrealism from the mid-1930s of which Caillois later becomes a strenuous advocate. Ernst seems to have borrowed from Fuseli the arched back pose of the saint, recalling the Surrealist iconography of convulsive hysteria, and Fuseli's reference to states of demonic possession and nocturnal visits by incubi (a subject addressed by the Surrealists in the discussions on sexuality reported in La Revolution surréaliste in 1928). The notion that in repose the saint might find himself in the grip of unruly emotions that are kept in check by day strikes one as eminently compatible with a Surrealist mindset. As we have seen, Roger Caillois' essay 'Mimicry and Legendary Psychasthenia' drew examples of a mimetic tendency from literature and art as well as from nature. It concludes with a truly alarming passage from Gustave Flaubert's Temptation of St. Anthony (1874) in which Saint Anthony, in a state of delirium, submits to a disorienting vision of animal, mineral, and vegetable kingdoms merged together in a sort of mimetic flux: The Declaims of Babylon, which are trees, have human heads for their fruit; there are Mandrakes singing, the Baaras root runs in the grass...

Polyparies looking like sycamores have arms on their boughs. Antony thinks he sees a caterpillar between two leaves; but a butterfly takes off. He is about to step on a pebble; a grey grasshopper leaps up. Insects resembling rose-petals adorn a bush; the remains of may-flies form a snowy layer on the ground. And then the plants become confused with the rocks. Stones are similar to brains, stalactites to nipples, iron flowers to tapestries ornate with figures.85 Compare this account with the universe revealed by Ernst's visionary faculties one rainy day at a seaside inn as his gaze was arrested by the furrows of worn floorboards that suggested to him all manner of forms. This revelatory experience, which Ernst dates very precisely to 10 August 1925, inspired him to begin using frottage.86 By means of associative mental processes of suggestion and contagion — similar, Ernst reports, to what occurs in hypnagogic visions — the graphite rubbings he took from wooden planks and a variety of other patterned and textured surfaces opened up to him a veritable mimetic universe. The Histoire naturelle (1926) series of frottages that resulted from the application of this technique play havoc with the idea of taxonomic order. OXFORD ART JOURNAL 35.3 2012 387 85.

With head bowed forward in the act of tapping a nail into a plank, Ernst peers intently at the wooden floor. Another portrait of Ernst from this time by the American photographer Frederick Sommer (Fig. 12) employs a double exposure to create a sort of camouflage effect. The textured surfaces of granite and weathered wooden planks in the photograph are ones that Ernst routinely used to induce his own St. Anthony-style visions. It is as though he has fallen prey to temptation: a temptation that Caillois had defined for the mimetic organism as the lure of assimilation by space. The artist—sorcerer is so to speak caught in his own trap. Of the body of work, with Temptation of St. Anthony its delirious climax, might we be permitted to say that mimicry as a principle in nature and human culture that confounds any thought of fixed identities finally comes home to roost?
