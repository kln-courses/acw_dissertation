Tome III.-Les Cultes Indi- genes Nationaux et Locaux: Afrique du Nord, Peninsule Iberique, Gaule. By J. TOUTAIN. Paris: Ernest Leroux, 1920. THE present volume of 470 pages advances a stage the great work which Dr. Toutain has in hand of surveying the pagan religions of the Roman Empire. It will be remembered that the first volume, published in 1907, dealt with the official cults and the Roman and Greco-Roman cults in the Latin provinces, while in the second, pub- lished in 1911, the author treated of the Oriental cults and their diffusion within the same limits. In this third volume Dr. Toutain, still confining himself to the Latin provinces, has begun the treatment of the indigenous cults-the native cults, that is, which existed before the period of Roman domination and lasted on into it. The first half of this volume, containing North Africa and Iberia, was published separately in 1917. Now with the addition of Gaul it is completed, but it will require at least one more volume to finish the indigenous cults of the Latin provinces, and so, presumably, to bring to an end the first part of the work. Dr. Toutain's is a stupendous task, and he is much to be congratulated that, in spite of all the difficulties of the war-period, he has been able to issue this substantial contribution towards its completion. The range of his inquiry is vast and the detailed investigation in- volved enormous. Few scholars would be competent to criticise the work in detail, and I cannot attempt to do more than indicate its plan and the kind of interest which will be found in it as a book of reference or-for it is far more than a book of reference-in a continuous reading. The same methodical treatment of the subject is pursued to which we have become accustomed in the earlier volumes. Taking each province in turn, Dr. Toutain treats successively of the various divinities worshipped, the character of the sanctuaries, the nature</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW IiI of rites and offerings, the geographical and social diffusion of the cults, and their duration under the Roman Empire. This procedure has the advantage of uniformity, but it tends to obscure a little the striking features of the individual provinces. For instance, most readers of the present volume would say that the interest in Gaul lay in the character of the barbaric and semi-anthropo- morphic deities worshipped, in Africa in the strangeness of some of the rites, and in Iberia perhaps in the diffusion of the cults in different parts of the provinces. Dr. Toutain gives us little indication of this, but leaves us to work it out for ourselves. Somewhat similar is his treatment of disputed points; his caution almost amounts to timidity, as, for instance, in the interesting discussion (pp. 226 ff. ) whether the symbols found in representations of the mysterious 'God of the Mallet' in Gaul are to be interpreted allegorically or realistically. No one could pronounce with such authority as Dr. Toutain himself, and it is rather tantalising when he refrains. The outcome of this intensely me- thodical and cautious procedure is a certain dryness of result: the salient points are hardly brought out enough, and we miss anything of the character of a general summary to guide us in the consideration of details-perhaps this will come at the end of the new volume. Nevertheless, certain points emerge which are of great interest for the study both of the religions of the provinces and of the character of the Roman imperial rule. In the first place the duration of these indigenous cults and their continued popularity under the Roman govern- ment is very remarkable. Apart from the suppression of such practices as that of human sacrifice, Rome seems to have preserved a complete indifference to the indigenous cults. She neither participated in them-in each case the records of Roman worshippers are negligible-nor did she molest them. Crowds of native worshippers seem to have visited the shrines, performed the rites and left their offerings, while Rome stood aside. Religious toleration and neutrality were uniformly observed. Secondly, though in the more Romanised parts of the provinces the native deities were often assimilated to Greco-Roman gods either in name or in representation or in both, yet they were never merged in character: they always remain distinguishable by an epithet or a symbol. Sometimes, too, the identification seems purely arbitrary -as though the worshippers just sought a Roman name for their god without much thought of appropriateness. Thus it is odd to find that the Gaulish 'Jupiter' has a wheel for his emblem, and is a solar deity in character, while their 'Apollo' has nothing to do with the sun, but is god of thermal springs and a healer. This is very unlike the systematic assimilation which the Romans made of their own deities to those of Greece, and looks again as if Romans were indifferent, and the attempted assimilation came from the side of ignorant natives. Thirdly, no reader can fail to be struck by the extremely primitive character of some of the surviving cults. In Gaul one deity is beast-headed, representing a half-completed emer- gence into anthropomorphism; another is tricephalous, representing, so Dr. Toutain thinks, a syncretism of three once independent divinities. Others have strange offerings, small animals and birds in Africa, whose bones were preserved in vases, and votive axes in Gaul (possibly an early form of currency). Their sanctuaries are rarely buildings, but usually enclosures-some- times on mountain-tops, or at the sources of rivers; not infrequently caverns, and even the flat open sides of cliffs were sacred places. All this seems to show the tenacity of popular beliefs beneath a superficial culture, and this is strongly borne out when, as in Gaul, we find these strange old deities still persisting in easily recog- nised forms: it is not hard to see the Fatae and Matrae (notice the bar- baric forms) in the fies and martes of French folklore to-day. There are many more generalisations the reader can make for himself, and meanwhile all students of comparative religion must be grateful to Dr. Toutain for his collection and cautious sifting of the material. It is of peculiar interest</page><page sequence="3">112 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW to English readers to know that the next volume will begin with a survey of the native cults of Britain. We shall look forward to it eagerly. Is it too much to ask that it shall be provided with a good index? C. BAILEY.</page></plain_text>
