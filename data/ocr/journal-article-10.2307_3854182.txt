<plain_text><page sequence="1">52 EGYPTIAN THERIOMORPHIC1 VESSELS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM BY S. R. K. GLANVILLE With Plates XII to XVI. The most important objects published in this paper are three stone vases illustrated on P1. XII, Figs. 1-6, and P1. XIII, Figs. 1-3. It was impossible, however, to avoid some compari- sons with similar material, and this in turn led inevitably to a discussion of the origin of this type of vase, thus widening the selection of material. In writing the paper I have had the advantage of frequent discussions with Dr. Hall, the Keeper, and Messrs. Sidney Smith and C. J. Gadd of the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities. Their assistance has not always stopped short at discussion, as will be seen from the references in the text. I have to thank the Keeper for permission to publish the objects illustrated which are in the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities. I am also indebted to Mr. T. A. Joyce, Deputy Keeper in charge of the Ethnographical Department, to Mr. E. J. Forsdyke, Assistant-Keeper in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities, and to Mr. Einar Gjerstad, for valuable help on certain points. Finally, I have been very considerably helped by a discussion of the whole subject with Mr. H. Frankfort, who was the first to raise the interesting and iimiportant question of the origin of these vases, and to whom I owe much for his suggestive theories, although I cannot find all his arguments convincing or agree with some of his main conclusions. The three stone vases shown on P1. XII, Figs. 1-6, and P1. XIII, Figs. 1-3 are now exhibited side by side in Wall-case 156 of the Fourth Egyptian Room. They were acquired by the Museum in 1901, 1902, and 1914 respectively, and nothing is known of their earlier history. This small collection is important both as a series (for there has been little or no attempt hitherto to distinguish the different types of these early stone theriomorphs) and for the detailed study of the individual vases. But in so far as the individual characteristics, technique, artistic merit and hypothetical use are of most value when studied in connexion with one another, or even with another set of characteristics displayed by other objects, it was clearly more profitable for scientific purposes (not to speak of aesthetic claims) to exhibit the three vases together than to attempt a more precise individual dating which might require their separation from each other. It is proposed to describe each one separately first, and then to consider them in relation to other material. B.M. 35306 (P1. XII, Figs. 1-3)2 is a red breccia vase in the shape of a dove and of 1 For the sake of brevity this word has been allowed a wider meaning throughout the article than it should carry, in order to include birds and fishes. 2 See Guide to the Third and Fourth Egyptian Rooms, etc., 1904, p. 244, P1.

Its length from beak to tail is 71 ins., height to the top of its head 43 ins., and greatest width 31 ins. The body has been hollowed out so thoroughly as to give not only the effect but the use of a vase. The only opening in this receptacle is a hole in the top, finished with a very low splayed neck, or rather a rim simply, such as is typical of the finer vases of the earliest period. The diameter of the hole itself is only 1lg- ins.; and with the rim 1 ins. It is to be noticed that the back of the bird slopes upwards appreciably on either side of the rim, thus allowing the drill a wider angle of play without which the stone-cutter could never have reached so far towards the head and tail as he has done. Another common feature of the early stone vases, the pierced horizontal lugs, is also found, one on each side of the bird; the effect of these, doubtless appreciated by the artist but not to be taken as necessarily intended by him, is in a general way to suggest wings. The head is neatly and faithfully rendered, leaving no doubt in the mind as to the identification with a dove or pigeon. The eyes are small, shallow, smooth-bored holes to take inlay, probably of the kind that is found in the exactly similar eyes of the predynastic Hathor amulets' and many of the slate palettes, namely a shell or faience circular bead with or without filling of paste. The exceedingly fine workmanship, shown not only in the delicate cutting of the rimmed opening and the fine modelling of the head, but also in the proportions and smooth finish, points conclusively to a much earlier date than the First Dynasty (when both the rim round the hole and the eyes are considerably debased): and when we add to that the mechanical skill which hollowed out the body to a depth of 3 ins., it is impossible to place this vase later than the middle predynastic period, when the art of stone-cutting was still at its zenith. Moreover it will be generally admitted that there is no other vase of this kind published which can compare with it in fineness. B.M. 36355 (P1. XII, Figs. 4-6) would also appear to represent a bird, but it is perhaps unwise to attempt a closer definition. The length from beak (?) to tail is 4- ins. and the greatest height 3-T ins. The body is hollowed out to a depth of nearly 2 ins., but the hole in the back is much larger in proportion than that of the pigeon, having a diameter of 1 3 ins. (with the rim 2 1 ins.). The rim again is simply a low flat ring rising from the back ,3 in., showing no undercutting, and it varies in width. The eyes are larger and deeper than in the dove, and there has been no attempt to polish away the ridges left by the drill. The base is flat, consisting of two thick straight ridges running in the same sense as the bird's body, and not quite parallel to one another. These appear to represent legs, so that the bird would be seen squatting on the ground2. There is a horizontal lug with rather large boring on each side. The material is green serpentine, but a bad smash at some time in its early history has necessitated the restoration of the left lug and a patch in the back-both in coarse cement. Thus we have here the three characteristics of the stone vases, eyeholes for inlay, pierced lugs and rimmed mouth. These are first found in the early predynastic period, and reach perfection in the middle and later predynastic periods; they are already debased in protodynastic times and disappear at the end of the 1 Well illustrated in PETRIE, Amtlets, P1.

Petrie further particularises them as "bulls," but the Hathor-cow seems a more attractive identification and at least as probable. There would be a special point in using the symbolic head of the goddess as Bucrania. 2 Cf. two bird vases illustrated in Delegation en Perse, vII, 19, Figs. 11 and 13.</page><page sequence="4">S. R. K. GLANVILLE Old Kingdom. But whereas in the dove these characteristics were at their best, in this shapeless bird they have considerably deteriorated, and we shall be strongly inclined to date the vase to the archaic period-perhaps, in view of other evidence, more precisely to the First Dynasty. Indeed it may well be compared to the two bird vases from the "Main deposit" at Hierakonpolis' dated to the First Dynasty, although one of these is of slightly superior workmanship. Our third vase, B.M. 53888 (P1. XIII, Figs. 1-3), though perhaps the least attractive artistically is in every other way the most interesting of the group, and by the same token presents the most difficult problems. It is of pink limestone (the polished surface brown with age), 67 ins. long by 5; ins. high by 2| ins. wide. Nearly the whole of the body has been hollowed out, leaving a deep elliptical well the longitudinal walls of which are only -f in. thick for the greater part. The sides are almost perpendicular, indicating an entirely different technique from that used in making the bird vases just described. The body almost rests on the ground, four protuberances at the corners representing (with surprising realism considering their shortness) the legs of some bulky animal. The tail is fairly thin, measures about half the height of the beast, and is barely indicated by a slight ridge down the back of the vase. In the head, however, the salient features of the animal have been carefully preserved : the ridged dome to the skull, the broad forehead, the position of the ears (though their shape has been missed and they are not large enough), the "pig " eyes, and above all the protruding lower lip all go to make absolutely certain the restoration of the snout as an elephant's trunk (P1. XIII, Fig.2)2. The tail is then seen to be equally true to life, and the ridiculously short legs to enhance the general effect of nmassiveness which would be the strongest impression left on the mind of an Egyptian who had once seen a southern elephant. The absence of tusks is noteworthy when we remember that ivory was commonly in use from the earliest predynastic times. But the artist who made the vase probably had in mind as his model a tame beast-perhaps sent as a gift, perhaps traded, from Nubia3-belonging to the Pharaoh, and such a one might well have had his tusks sawn off before he reached Egypt. Besides its theriomorphism and its hollowed out interior the elephant has no features in common with the bird vases. The eyes which alone might prove an exception are incised, 1 QUIBELL and P[ETRIE], Hierakonpolis 1, P1. XX, 2 and 4. The following is a list of the important publications of the early stone theriomorphs: PETRIE and QUIBELL, Naqada and Ballas, P1. XII, 80-84, and p. 36; GARSTANG, Maahdsna and Bet Khalldf, P1.

Since, however, it is impossible to tell what form his copy would have taken, it seemed best to make as realistic a representation as possible, without strict regard for the limits of simplicity imposed by the nature of the material. 3 Professor Newberry includes the elephant in his list of predynastic fauna on the evidence of the ivory knife handle in the Brooklyn Museum (Egypt as a field for anthropological research, Presidential address to the Anthrop. Section of the Brit. Association 1923, p. 5). It seems, however, to have been confined to the district of Egypt's southern boundary (see B6nedite in Journal, v, 237) as we should expect, and has disappeared by the dynastic period (Newberry, ibid.). To an Egyptian livilg even a little north of the district which later became the Nome of Elephantine, the elephant would have been a foreign animal. 54</page><page sequence="5">I 5 I, 3.

The striking difference, however, is in their careful imitation of the shape and tilt of the living animal's eyes, as compared with the conventional circular eyes of the birds, which are found on all the other animals-whether vases, slate palettes or amulets-of the technique that did its best work in the finer and harder stones. There are no lugs; nor is there any rim round the large hole which is where the animal's back would be. Indeed the plain undecorated edge of this opening seems to require a lid to complete it. There are, it is true, no signs of wear; but one may call to mind the "lid of a hippopotamus vase" found by Petrie on a pre- dynastic sitel. Just below the edge of the opening the sides are pierced with three small holes, two at the back, roughly above the back legs, one in front in a corresponding position on the left side of the animal. Instead of a hole to balance this on the right side a semi- circular notch, diam. in., has been cut out. The obvious supposition that this is an accidental chip appears at first belied by the smoothness of the surface, the rounded corners, and the symmetry of the cut. Further, the idea that it was part of the original design is encouraged by the fact that in the only known theriomorphic stone vessel (from Abusir el- Melek) which can compare with ours there appears to be a similar semicircular notch, in this case at the corresponding point at the back of the right side of the aninmal2. The base of the notch in our object, however, is a groove pointing in the direction of the right ear and continued so for i in. across the shoulders; and less is demanded of our credulity if we suppose that this groove is the remains of a fourth hole (which had admittedly rather lost direction), and that in the boring of it, or soon afterwards, the piece of the edge above it chipped off. The notch thus left was evidently smoothed down all round, and perhaps the prolongation of the groove must be attributed to an attempt to improvise some use for it in place of the intended hole. As to the purpose of these holes there can be only two possibilities: they must have served either for suspension in some way, or to tie on the lid, if one existed. That there almost certainly was a lid I am convinced by the very definite flat edge of another vessel (B.M. 22825, P1. XIII, Fig. 4), which differs from this type only in being made of wood. If the second possibility were correct, we should suppose that four pieces of string were knotted each at one end and passed from inside the vessel through the four holes and tied in pairs over the lid. It is hard to believe, however, that this is sufficient reason for the holes-or rather that it is not an unnecessarily elaborate method of keeping a lid in place. We are therefore left with the alternative possibility that the holes were used for hanging the vessel to some person or thing. It has been suggested to me that it was suspended round the neck of some animal, as part of a religious ritual. This is perhaps most in keeping with its theriomorphic nature, but until more evidence is forthcoming we cannot definitely say what purpose it served-nor indeed what it contained. That it was not an ordinary household utensil is, I think, clear from the rarity of this type of vessel, apart from its special features. On the other hand it may have been part of the ecclesiastical property of some temple. 1 PETRIE and QUIBELL, Naqada and Ballas, 36, P1. XII, 84. 2 MOLLER in Y.D.O.G., No. 30, p. 17, Fig. 16. The animal is there unhesitatingly stated to be a camel lying down; the identification is doubtless due to the shape of the neck, the doubled-under forelegs and the high back giving the effect of a hump well packed with bales, rather than to the head, which is not very convincing.</page><page sequence="7">S. R. K. GLANVILLE There are few criteria from which to date the vase. The general effect of shape, polish and stone indicates the predynastic to archaic periods', but the absence of the important characteristics we have noted in the theriomorphic vases as a whole during that period might suggest that our elephant belongs near its end, when the lug, rimmed opening and inlaid eyes were rapidly deteriorating; in this case we should expect it to be dated on general grounds to the first three dynasties. This would agree admirably with the more specific evidence of the Berlin camel vase (see p. 55, note 2, above) which was found at Abussir el-Melek, and is thereby dated to the First Dynasty. In default of other evidence we may assume that the elephant vase belongs to the late predynastic period or to the First Dynasty. We must now consider the wooden vessel referred to above. B.M. 22825 (length from snout to tail 8-1 ins.: height 45 ins., P1. XIII, Fig. 4) represents a hippopotamus and should perhaps be described as a box, owing to its material. But in type-both as to form and details-it is so like the elephant vase that it must be closely related to it, and can be safely dated by that similarity alone to the late predynastic period. The only technical difference in the two styles is the representation of the eye. In the hippopotamus, instead of being incised and perhaps inlaid, it takes the form of a protuberance left in the wood. But the well-known bulging eye of the hippopotamus should be sufficient to account for this, since the distinguishing feature of the eyes of the elephant is also their realistic likeness to nature. The more pronounced (but still stubby) legs of the hippopotamus are doubtless due to the greater facility of working in wood than in stone, and the more brittle nature of the latter. For the rest the details enhance the similarity between the two vases, not the least conspicuous of which are the four holes symmetrically arranged round the top; moreover the flattened edge round the big opening in the back of the animal certainly implies that there was a lid in this case. As to the purpose of the holes, the same remarks apply as to the elephant vase. On the other hand the fact that wood is the material used makes it unlikely that oil or other liquids were the original contents. Finally, the striking similarity of form (allowing for the differentiation due to their completely dissimilar purposes) between this wooden hippopotamus and the predynastic hippopotamus amulets2 is worth noting, as confirmation of the dating of the vases. The most salient feature common to both, however, is the deep furrow which indicates the mouth. This is also found in some of the Hathor-head amulets (see above, p. 53). Thus all these vases are seen to give a series which started well back in the predynastic period and extended to the Second or Third Dynasty-a series of which the second and third members may actually be contemporary, whereas the third may be regarded as logically later than the second, though in nowise a direct development from it. We have seen that the first two are related by technique, and in the case of the stone palettes to some degree by form, to such typically Egyptian objects as the predynastic slate palettes and Hathor 1 Theriomnorphic vases in stone are not known after the protodynastic period, unless we are to include the alabaster toilet dishes in the shape of ducks, common in the Eighteenth Dynasty. Human figures in alabaster and serpentine are of course familiar from that time. (For the chronological distribution see Miss MURRAY, op. cit., passim.) 2 See PETRIE, Amnulets, P1. XL, 235 b, c, d. There are two good examples in the B.M., nos. 57742, 57741, exhibited (temporarily) in table-case H, Room V of the Egyptian Galleries. The head alone was retained in the Sixth to the Ninth Dynasty hippopotamus head amulets (ibid., 237 d-p). 56</page><page sequence="8">EGYPTIAN THERIOMORPHIC VESSELS IN BRITISH MUSEUM 57 amulets, and that the third, even if it has broken away in part fromn the old form, yet follows that essentially Egyptian tradition of making receptacles, which are to be used as such, out of stone. It would seem therefore that we have an excellent case prima facie for a native Egyptian hand-craft in these animal vases. It has recently been argued1 however with sufficient skill to convince authoritative scholars that the theriomorphic vase in Egypt as elsewhere, can be traced to an origin in North Syria. One is tempted to believe that in postulating this theory Mr. Frankfort has allowed a greater sense of conviction to express itself in his writing than he actually possesses, for his arguments even at their face value only sustain a probability in favour of his case, while he would admit (though he does not explicitly state it) that a certain probability for their Egyptian origin is inherent in the nature of the objects. The point is of sufficient importance to necessitate a careful and detailed enquiry into the soundness of his arguments. The main steps in his exposition are as follows. Taking first Susa, we find there at the archaic period vases of alabaster in the shapes of birds and animals2, with the rimmed opening on the back, showing what Frankfort reasonably calls "striking similarities" with the Egyptian material. But he quickly notes the "remarkable differences between the vessels of the two regions," viz. (1) the receptivity of the completely hollowed out Egyptian examples as opposed to the " creux...insignifiant, pouvant a peine contenir quelques gouttes de liquide3" of the Susian vases, (2) the pierced lugs on the Egyptian are absent on the Susian vases, and (3) in Susa alabaster is the only stone, while in Egypt we find serpentine, breccia and other decorative stones, but never (at this period) alabaster theriomorphs. He dates the material from Egypt to the First Dynasty on the strength of the two bird vases from Hierakonpolis4, but virtually qualifies this by admitting that "there are pottery animal vases of this type in 'decorated ware' which can hardly be later than the beginning of the late Predynastic periodS." His conclusion from this comparison, in which the differences rather than the similarities are stressed, is that it will be "natural to assume " an Egyptian origin for the Susian alabasters which would "then have reached Susa via North Syria, as an alabaster bird vase strikingly similar to the Susian specimens comes from Meskineh." (See F., P1. IX, Fig. 3.) " Several facts" however (but not the essential differences mentioned above apparently, since they offer no objection to the alternative proposal) "seem incompatible with this view." Let us deal with these facts. To clear the ground, the possibility of a Cycladic origin, based on "a sheep with three6 cups of the well-known type hollowed out in its back..." (from one of the Aegean islands 1 FRANKFORT, op. cit. (henceforward referred to as F.), 111-113, Tf 44.

Even so it is questionable whether some of those with which he was familiar, e.g., the duck figured by him on P1. XIX, 2, could ever have been brought down so late as the First Dynasty, especially when we remember that this example is published as predynastic (by Petrie and Miss Murray) and came from the well-known predynastic site of Nakidah. In any case he would be the last to deny that there is a connection between his stone theriomorphs of the First Dynasty antd the decorated pottery animal vases of the predynastic period. We shall see the importance of this later. 6 In the photograph published by Frankfort (P1. IX, Fig. 4) only two cups are shown; Mr. E. T. Leeds kindly confirmed for me the fact of there being two.

GLANVILLE and now in the Ashmolean), "and the bird-shaped vase of brown limestone " and an " oblong, triple vessel" of island marble found together in a First Dynasty grave at Abusir el-Melekl, is repudiated for the sake of the greater cause. The islands, like Egypt, "have borrowed this type of vessel from North Syria." What is the evidence ? I. The only object from Egypt itself is the camel from Abusir el-Melek2, which "certainly points to an Asiatic prototype." Asia, however, is not synonymous with North Syria, and we have the important negative evidence of the cuneiform inscriptions which do not mention the camel before the eleventh century B.C.3 Now if the camel was known in North Syria even in protodynastic times, it would have been used as the baggage animal on the caravan routes to Mesopotamia and Elam, the existence of which Mr. Frankfort implies throughout; and we should be certain to find some mention of this all-important means of transport in the innumerable business documents concerned with Syrian traffic written in the cuneiform script4. In other words its likeness to a camel is a fair proof that this vase did not itself come from Syria and a strong argument in favour of its prototype having come from anywhere but there. Assuming that it is the single-humped camel, its original home at this time could only have been S. Arabia, a fact which would be more happily explained by Frankfort's highly probable conclusion that the stone vase industry came into the Nile valley with a people living on the western shores of the Red Sea at the other end of the Wadi Ilammamat5, than it is by a German scholar's rather vague suggestion that it is a relic from the earliest Semitic infiltration6. 1 See p. 55 above with note 2 for the reference. 2 Ibid. 3 On the Broken Obelisk, of Tiglath Pileser I's breeding dromedaries (RAWLINSON, Cuneiform Inscriptions, I, 28, 27 a). This is the two-humped "Bactrian" camel (Ass. udru) which appears again on the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III in the second half of the ninth century. They are there part of a " tribute " from Musri, which in this context must be Egypt (in its larger sense of all the countries under Egyptian influence, perhaps here Southern Syria and Palestine). Of the other animals represented the ox, rhinoceros and oryx (?) are Egyptian, but the elephant, as W. M. Miiller has shown in the Zeit. Ass., viI, 211, is the Indian species. Professor Olmstead's confident assertion that it is the African species (History of Assyria, 142) is plainly contradicted by the only relevant detail in the relief, namely, the shape and size of the ears. In depicting the camel from Musri with two humps the artist has confused that name with the Musri in the Median Hills (see SMITH in Journal, x, 110, note 4), whence Tiglath-Pileser and Shalmaneser himself received tribute, and where the "Bactrian" camel might be expected to exist. Miller's statement that it could only have been the two-humped camels which were remarkable (op. cit., p. 213) cannot stand, since it assumes that the single-humped camel (Ass. gammalu) was already a common object among the Assyrians, whereas this type does not appear to be mentioned in their inscrip- tions until the end of the eighth century. (See Muss-ARNOLT, 229.) It is, however, depicted in a relief of Shalmaneser, see KING, The Bronze Reliefs from the Gates of Shalmaneser, Pls. XXIII, XXIV. For these and other references to Mesopotamian authorities I am indebted to Messrs. Sidney Smith and C. J. Gadd, who have also verified the pertinent passages in the original text for me. 4 Smith has pointed out in Rev. d'Ass., xxi, 87, that pack-asses were the regular transport animals at the time of the Cappadocian Tablets (end of the Third Millennium) in the "traffic from the north-west to Babylonia" and that they were still famous a thousand years later "when they were called 'Amorite,' see KING, Boundary Stones, I, 39, 11. 17-18." It seems that camels have been used along river routes only in comparatively modern times, being confined at first when they did come into general use in Mesopotamia to the desert routes. 5 F., p. 100 following. 6 M.D.O.G., No. 30, Mai 1906, pp. 16, 17.

"A remarkable vase in the shape of a quadruped, again with a rimmed opening in the back " from Keul Tepe in Cappadocial. Now the tablets found at Keul Tepe are dated to about 2300 B.C. on the very earliest reckoning, so that this vase may be assumed to be somewhere about that time-i.e. 1000 years after the end and perhaps 2000 after the beginning of the stone theriomorph period in Egypt. Nor is Cappadocia the same as North Syria; but we are asked to see a North Syrian origin for the Cappadocian vase which thus serves to show the continuity of this type in the region of North West Asia. The important point for us, however, is the object itself; for there is no resemblance to anything Egyptian beyond the "rimmed opening" which again is in itself a far cry from the Egyptian stone or pottery rim. Moreover there is a hole at the end of the snout, a detail which on Frankfort's own showing2 should be of fundamental importance in dis- tinguishing types. Together with this vase from Keul Tepe we are to take "the silver stag from Mycenae" which "points to Anatolia by its origin." Its date, however, at the most generous estimate cannot be earlier than 1700 (beginning of M.M. III) and is more probably about 1600 to 1500. And though the use of silver (it was an alloy of two parts to one of lead3) may point to an Anatolian mine, the stag more probably came from a Mycenaean workshop. The balance is therefore at least equally in favour of an indigenous origin for the animal-shaped vase. Moreover what Schliemann calls the " mouthpiece in the shape of a funnel4," which is the important detail in favour of the argument, is the only possible device (of such an elementary nature) which would make the vase pour effectively- III.

SCHLIEMANN, Mycenae und Tiryns, p. 257. 4 Ibid., with Fig. 376. 5 I cannot find sufficient evidence for this widely held opinion. I am, however, under a considerable obligation to Mr. Einar Gjerstad for the following answers to my enlquiries, and for his permission to print them. The grounds for maintaining a Syrian origin for the base-ring ware seem to be these: I. "...a few base-ring shapes actually imitate the foreign (probably North Syrian) types"; i.e. "(1) long spindle- shaped flasks, (2) lentoid pilgrim bottles." These two types are familiar to us in the wheel-made red polished pottery found on Egyptian and Palestinian sites. II. This same " North Syrian pottery is found imported in Cyprus." The important facts against a Syrian origin are these: (1) The base-ring ware "is hand-made but all contemporary Syrian pottery is wheel-made." (2) It is "imitated by the Syrian potters (in Gezer many specimens of imported genuine base-ring ware were found together with occasional wheel- made imitations in Palestinian clay)." (3) "Most of the typical shapes are developed out of old Cypriote types." There can scarcely be any doubt therefore that the base-ring ware found in Cyprus was also made there. Mr. Gjerstad goes further and says that "the base-ring ware is Cypriote." The only objection to this is, as Mr. F. N. Pryce of the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities has s pointed out to me, that we then have two contemporary types of pottery in Cyprus, closely related to each other but differing in a number of essentials; twin developments from a single tradition, and both displaying native techniques. Of these two types one has a more barbaric character than the other, and it is for the more civilized ware that a foreign origin, or influence, is claimed. On the other hand a cursory survey of this ware will be sufficient to show that the greater number of foreign types are not Syrian but Anatolian in appearance, and of these an obvious example is the "bull-shaped vase" with its strong suggestion of a leathern model and reminiscence of the bull cults of Anatolia. Now if the various types of base-ring ware all share a single technique, which is said to be foreign, it clearly cannot come from two different places. We must either sacrifice the Syrian case, or abandon the idea of a foreign origint and admit that the ware is native Cypriote. 8-2</page><page sequence="11">S. R. K. GLANVILLE sponding to the Eighteenth Dynasty. It should be noted too that in addition to the spout this type of vase has a small handle, one end of which comes down to join the spout. IV. "A few theriomorphic vases" found in Palestine (by Macalister at Gezer)l whose significance is that they occur at the period of greatest contact between Egypt and North Syria, i.e. when V. ' vases appear in the shape of animals and human beings" of the same ware "as the red polished flasks, whose North Syrian origin is well established "; i.e. again in the Eighteenth Dynasty. Although, as Mr. Frankfort says, this pottery was sometimes imitated by the Egyptians, yet the bulk of it, though obviously made in the form of Egyptian figures and therefore presumably for the Egyptian market, was actually of foreign manufacture, and there can be no question that the human figures either were imported from, or in the case of imitations originated in, Syria or Palestine. But no animal forms are known in this pottery nor in its imitations. He clearly has in mind the calf vase (whose spout is on the top of the head, not on the back) and hedgehog vase (where the low spout is right in front and tilted forward with a small handle attached) found by Mace at El-'Amrah2. They are not, however, of this red polished ware, and Frankfort himself remarks in a note that " it is curious to observe with him [Professor J. L. Myres] the Aegean features in these Syrian products...3." Now the ware of the calf vase at any rate is admitted to be native Egyptian. Are we then justified, remembering the Aegean characteristics, in assuming that the vases are Syrian products ? VI. "The apparently most ancient rhyta" come from Anatolia. The objects on which this statement is based are: (1) the clay bull's head rhyton published by Woolley in his Hittite Burial CIustoms4 where he justly claims that it "shows a striking resemblance to Cretan work of Late Minoan I." It is difficult then to see why he should have assigned it "almost certainly" to his Second Period, i.e. that of the "champagne-glass" vases which, according to his dating, must be well before 1750 B.C. (2) "Apparently" a pottery bull's head found at Keramo in Caria and published by M. Pottier5, in whose opinion it is a piece admittedly of archaic style, but which "on pourrait faire descendre jusqu'a l'6poque classique du vie siecle." The value of (2) is therefore automatically discounted by the much earlier date of (1). This, however, in its turn must yield precedence of date, for the earliest rhyta are the complete pottery bulls with acrobatic figures in relief from the tholoi of the Messara discovered by Dr. Xanthoudides6 from which the head-rhyta were evolved by the process of eliminating all but the essentially practical part of the vessel. Their date is M.M. I. They are ritual libation vessels and differ from the theriomorphic vases we are discussing in having besides the large aperture in the top a smaller one in the snout of the beast for pouring. Finally we may perhaps go back still further for the original of this form of vessel to the Early Minoan jugs with side spouts (E.M. I and III)7 which are perhaps 1Somewhat discounted by Mr. Frankfort on the grounds of their uncertain date. 2 El Amrah and Abydos, 72 ff. and Pls. XLVIII and L.

One might add "and of human beings " (see FORSDYKE, op. cit., P1. II, A 68), and compare with these the anthropomorphic pottery vase from Assur, published by ANDRAE, Die archaischen Ischtar-Tempel in Assur, which is of the early Sumerian period. VII. Possibly "the few theriomorphic vases from Troja" which "present rather a different aspect." The two objects noticed2 are excellent examples of the theriomorphic tendency in the Yortan pottery discussed above, with which type the early Trojan pottery is classed 3. VIII. "Pottery birds and four-legged animals of the same type as our vases were found by M. de Morgan [in the cemetery at Djonii containing bronze and iron implements] in the South Eastern Caucasus4." Frankfort admits that they have "a late and debased look" but doubts whether this kind of vessel "caracterise la periode de fer d'une maniere absolue" (Mission scientifique en Perse, Iv, 113) on the grounds of the published evidence being insufficient. The opening in the back is the only detail in which they resemble Egyptian theriomorphs. Their provenance is even less connected with North Syria than is Anatolia, and unless the presence of iron implements in the graves is to be ignored M. de Morgan was justified in giving the cemeteries a date which is considerably later than the Eighteenth Dynasty. The remarkable black hawk vase of the typical Hyksos " punctured " ware in the British Museum, No. 17046 (P1. XIII, Fig. 5)3, might well have been included as an important piece of the evidence. The spout in this case is on the top of the head and has a small handle attached to it. The vase is 31 ins. long from breast to tail, and 37 ins. high. Its date would place it immediately before the formidable mass of evidence Nos. III-V above, coming from the Eighteenth Dynasty, and thus offer another link in the connection with the pre- dynastic period which is required to support his thesis. How much of this vase is due to Syrian and how much to Egyptian influence will be discussed below (p. 68). The foregoing analysis shows clearly that the evidence divides itself into three stages, the chronological and territorial continuity of which is insufficient to justify the logical connection which is seen in it. The first stage consists of the two isolated instances I and II, above (the camel and vase from Keul Tepe), isolated in the sense that they have no historical or chronological connection with each other or with the material which follows, and occur at very much earlier dates. Moreover, as we have seen, I is valid only as an argument against Mr. Frankfort's thesis. The second stage gives us the solid evidence in III-V, all dated to the Eighteenth Dynasty (and, if we include the Hyksos vase, at most the 200 years immediately preceding 1580), which is the basis of the whole thesis. The argument so far then is to the effect that the earlier vases, similar to those from Syria in 1 FORSDYKE, Op. Cit., XII. 2 HUB. SCHMIDT, Heinrich Schliemann's Samml. Trojan.

XXV, 71, where it is erroneously assigned (p. 45) to the New Kingdom and described as "dark red" polished pottery.</page><page sequence="13">S. R. K. GLANVILLE the Eighteenth Dynasty, are themselves of Syrian origin. The third stage includes the remaining examples VI-VIII, admittedly of less reliable value and of various dates, from the Eighteenth Dynasty to the sixth century, with the exception of the much earlier Trojan vases (VII), and all from places well outside the most generous limits which could be given to North Syria. Here again the argument, though independent of the former, is from the Syrian vases of the Eighteenth Dynasty to the similar ones occurring later and elsewhere. Now although the second argument may be justifiable, the first is patently fallacious. The only proposition which might be legitimately deduced from these two groups of facts is that the early vases influenced those of the Eighteenth Dynasty', in which case the argument sets in exactly the opposite direction to that proposed by Mr. Frankfort. Thus he has strengthened the generally accepted theory of a Syrian or Palestinian2 origin for Egyptian figure-vases in the Eighteenth Dynasty3. For the therionorphic examples of these there is no direct evidence of a Syrian origin; on the contrary it is strongly on the side of Egypt as I shall hope to show. As for the earlier periods nothing has been advanced in the body of evidence which we have discussed but arguments against it. We have now to return to the alabaster bird vase from Meskineh, which though undated cannot be lightly put aside. Its very strong resemblance to the alabaster theriomorphic vases from Susa II (the archaic period) gives it considerable importance, the more so because Mr. Frankfort is thereby encouraged to assume an early date (roughly equivalent to Egyptian protodynastic) for the Syrian example. There are good reasons for doubting this assumption. In the first place the similarity with the Susian bird vases breaks down at the most vital point. For the Meskineh bird " is hollowed out to the bottom " and the cavity is enlarged in all directions; " the attempt to get back into the tail not very suc- cessful but in the breast quite neatly finished4." Thus the bird, though not so thoroughly scooped out as the Egyptian vases, resembles them in so far as it was evidently meant to be used as a vase, while the Susian theriomorphs with their very small cavities "hardly able to contain a few drops5" must have served a totally different purpose. But when a people borrows from another's culture it does so primarily for a practical purpose, and in doing so it usually retains, as near as may be, the original design of the object borrowed; this, however, is of secondary importance. Thus the Egyptian living in Akhetaten imitated in his own clay the " Cypriote " vases (i.e. base-ring ware, see above, p. 59) clearly that they might be used for the same purposes (i.e. to contain oil) as the originals of which also he had examples, taking care to make them in precisely the same shape, and adding in paint a coarse imitation of the original decoration. This illustrates both points: one might add 1 As might indeed be the case if Forsdyke is right in recognising a theriomorphic tendency in Anatolia which is intrusive elsewhere (op. cit., xii). 2 Whether we can justly narrow this range of country to North Syria is not yet clear from the evidence. 3 In spite of our highly organized interchange of trade there does not seem to be an exact parallel to-day to this unique phenomenon in the history of ancient economics. It is almost incredible that a com- paratively backward country should invent a specially artificial type of pot solely for export to another and more civilised people. Yet all the known figure vases of this ware represent Egyptian figures. 4 The two quotations are from Mr. E. T. Leeds who very kindly examined the vase for me in the Ashmolean. 5 F., 111. See also p. 57, note 3, above. Yet Mr. Frankfort speaks of the Meskineh vase as "an alabaster bird vase...which beyond any possible doubt belongs to the same series as the Susian examples." (Italics mine.) F., 73. 62</page><page sequence="14">EGYPTIAN THERIOMORPHIC VESSELS IN BRITISH MUSEUM 63 a third, that the adaptation of the original to indigenous decorative designs or characteristics requires a considerable time. Secondly, "alabaster" is not native to Syria. The material from which the Meskineh bird is made is not the fine, smooth-grained alabaster (calcite) which is usually found in Egypt, but the coarser aragonite. This stone is found in the Persian hills, and it is probable that the bird was made of Persian aragonite, although as we have seen it is not connected with the Susian bird vases of the same material which was almost certainly obtained from that source. Clearly then the assumption is that the Meskineh and the Susian vases were made at very different periods, since, though their materials come from the same quarries, yet their forms imply that they know nothing of each other. On the other hand we do find in North Syria at a later date alabaster vases in the shape of human figures of exactly the type found in the red polished pottery (see above, p. 60) and these are made of this same aragonite. We have seen, too, that the Meskineh bird is hollowed out somewhat after the fashion of the Egyptian stone vases. It is possible that to this extent it is borrowed from Egypt. With these considerations before us we should therefore expect it to be dated rather to the early part of the Eighteenth Dynasty than to the protodynastic period. As evidence then for the North Syrian origin of Egyptian theriomorphic vases it must be considered of equal value with the points III-V cited above and of no more. Thirdly, if the theriomorphic vase originated in North Syria we should expect to find it in pottery, the natural medium of a country which lacks stone suitable for carving. But there is no example in pottery before the Hyksos period. On the other hand pottery examples abound outside North Syria from the predynastic period onwards-in Susa, Cappadocia and Egypt itself, etc. We have seen that the internal evidence for a North Syrian origin of the theriomorphs amounts at the most generous estimate to an improbability. Let us now consider the negative evidence-or, as I should prefer to call it, the positive evidence for an Egyptian origin of the Egyptian vases. The important facts have already been suggested in the description of the three stone vases in the British Museum. They are as follows: I. The very early date of some of the material, e.g. B.M. 35306 and the duck from Nakadah', proves that the theriororphic vase was known in Egypt long before dynastic times, i.e. long before the earliest date assumed by Frankfort for the Meskineh vase. More- over pottery bird- and other animal-vases2 are found in Egypt from the predynastic period, some painted to imitate the stone ware and with imitation pierced lugs, and therefore probably to be dated close after the earliest stone vases; and all are dated by Petrie to the beginning of the late predynastic period3. In almost every case the rim is preserved round the opening at the back and the animals copied in pottery are the same as those copied in stone; so that remembering also the actual imitation of stone ware we can have no doubt of the close connection between the two. Finally, I am inclined to believe that the stone vases came first since we find the natural colouring of the breccia, etc., being copied in the painted pottery4; and if that is so it is still less likely that the Egyptians took the idea of 1 P1. XII, 81; MURRAY, op. Cit., P1. XXIII, 33. 2 MURRAY, op. cit., Pis. XXII, XXIII pass. 3 iVaqada, 37. 4 In a discussion of the whole question Mr. Frankfort showed me that the argument for the priority of the stone based on the pottery imitations is not conclusive. But I think he would allow me the weight of probability.</page><page sequence="15">S. R. K. GLANVILLE the theriomorph from North Syria where the prototype as we have seen would have been of pottery. Egypt, making pottery long before her stone cutters appeared from the Red Sea, would surely copy a new pottery form in pottery, not directly in stone; that would come later with experience won by working in the easier medium'. II. The animals represented are all known, or believed, to have been native to Egypt in predynastic times, e.g., duck (most of the other birds are not sufficiently natural to be identified, but the duck is by far the commonest bird represented), dove, vulture, frog, hedgehog, hippopotamus, fish (probably one of the Tilapia), and tortoise; the elephant and the camel are the only two exceptions, and these as we have seen are represented in an entirely different technique and form from the rest of the vases we are discussing. This difference of form argues again a different purpose, and I suggest that the two examples described above are objects with a special religious use in some way connected with the fact that they represent foreign animals. More than that we cannot say in the absence of further data. III. The technique of the inlaid eye, the pierced lug and the rim relate the stone bird and animal vases very closely to the ordinary stone vases2, in which the eye again is the same as that found on the slate palettes and the Hathor amulets. The slate palettes, too, include as their models some of the animals most commonly represented by the stone vases. Thus these vessels are seen to be akin to three of the most familiar and most characteristic classes of objects from predynastic burials. IV. The occurrence throughout Egyptian history of theriomorphic vases with rimmed holes in the back made of Egyptian clay and in the typical Egyptian technique (see MURRAY, op. cit., Pls. XXTTT-XXV; and here P1. XIII, Fig. 6 and P1. XIV, Figs. 1-6, described below). The only period during that history when we can definitely say that the vases are foreign (i.e. either importations from Syria or showing influence from that country or of Aegean culture) is from the time of the Hyksos to the early Nineteenth Dynasty. Finally the very great majority of vases known from that comparatively short space of time are not theriomorphic but anthropomorphic, whereas before that time vases in the shape of human figures are comparatively rare, and after it the proportion of the two classes is about equal. On P1. XIII, Fig. 6 and P1. XIV, Figs. 1-6 are published (for the first time)3 seven therio- morphic pottery vases in the B.M. having a rimmed opening in the back, which are not to be found in MURRAY, op. cit.4 P1. XIII, Fig. 6, B.M. 54365. Length from beak to tail 71 ins., height 4 ins. Acquired by the Museum in 1919. Provenance unknown. A vessel roughly shaped to suggest a goose with a large splaying cup in the middle of the back for filling, and wide opening in the head for pouring. Thin, light red pottery with smooth finish. The general effect of the pottery, with the splayed rim, indicates the Eleventh Dynasty as the probable date; this is an important addition to the evidence for the rim on theriomorphic vases during the periods after the protodynastic and before the Hyksos, in Egypt. P1. XIV, Figs. 1, 6, B.M. 38436-7, were both acquired in 1875; the provenance of the former is unknown; the latter, which was given by the Rev.

Fig. 1 (length from beak to tail 7i ins., height to top of head 54 ins.) is a vase made in realistic imitation of a dove, with a small spout in the back and a small hole in the beak, which is slightly elongated to facilitate pouring. Two spots of clay have been added as eyes and the body shows an unusual technique in that it is torpedo-shaped, having been turned on the wheel so that a vertical section would present a perfect circle. At the narrow end the vertical section has been finished with a low rim, and a tail, pinched out horizontally, has been added to this. Two small wings completed the bird, but the left-hand one has since been broken off. Pink, coarse pottery with light slip. The date is very uncertain; possibly Twelfth Dynasty, certainly not earlier, and if later probably Roman. Fig. 6 (length and height as before- 9|4 ins. by 48 ins.) is a similar vessel representing a bird whose exact nature is not clear. It resembles Fig. 1 in its principal points-rimmed opening (the rim since broken off), hole in beak, spotted eyes, small wings added at the finish, but lacks the torpedo body and has a much smaller tail. This again is pinched out horizontally and is incised to represent tail feathers. There are other groups of incised marks on either side of the back. The bird has three short legs, two in front and one behind-the latter clearly to enable it to stand upright. Coarse drab pottery with greenish slip. Date again uncertain: perhaps belonging to the second intermediate period-Thirteenth Dynasty-otherwise certainly Roman. Fig. 2, length 37 ins., height 4|a ins., B.M. 15475, given by the Henry Christy Trustees in 1879, originally from Lord Valentia's collection, is a return to the "Syrianising" type (by this time the common property of the Mediterranean world but not necessarily derived by it from Syria) in the form of a hedgehog, beautifully worked out in every detail. It has a narrow spout in the back with a handle, very suggestive of metal-work, attached to it on the shoulder. There is no other opening. The animal, whose feet are just indicated in relief, squats on a rectangular stand, which is also hollow. The depth of the vase was rendered possible by making it in two halves, the central line of their joining being clearly visible. Made of black pottery of the Roman period. Fig. 3, B.M. 5116, length 6 ins., height 3? ins., has no history, but it was already in the Museum in 1834. It is a hollow pottery fish with a small hole in the lip to which a spout had originally been added, though this is now lost. The head is pinched in, a nick represents the open mouth (there is no hole), and two large spots of clay the eyes. Red clay baked black right through, with red polished slip partly blackened by fire(?). Date possibly Eighteenth Dynasty, possibly late. The two remaining vases, Figs. 4 and 5, are somewhat similar. Fig. 4, B.M. 22410 (6J ins. x 6i ins.), was given to the Museum in 1885 by the Egypt Exploration Fund and came from Petrie's excavations at Tanis (House 44). It is therefore Roman. It is a vase in the shape of a cock, with a tall spout in the back, a handle attached at either side and coming down to the shoulder. There is no other opening except in the tail and that is due to the tip having been broken off. It stands on a low ring-base. Buff pottery with light slip decorated with red paint. Fig. 5, B.M. 48316, length from breast to tail 3j ins., height 4-7 ins., was acquired in 1874 from the Rev. Greville Chester with a large number of other objects most of which were known to have come from Tell el-Yahfdiyah, the Fayyim and Damanhur. In form very similar to the preceding one, this vase differs essentially in having a hole in the beak. It stands on a deep ring-base, and the tail has been pinched out into a wide horizontal fan-tail. The light buff pottery is only less coarse than the workmanship. A deep crease Journ. of Egypt. Arch. xI. 9</page><page sequence="18">S. R. K. GLANVILLE is still visible between the upper and lower halves of the tail and where these are more tightly pressed together the finger-prints are still obvious. These are to be seen at all the joins (e.g. where the handle meets the spout and the shoulder) and in a number of other places. It is decorated with a Coptic design in dark red paint, and to this period it may well be assigned'. These are, I think, the chief features of the internal evidence for an Egyptian origin, and in the absence of any conclusive evidence to the contrary they present a convincing case. Indeed it may be asked why we should expect these stone theriomorphs found in Egyptian graves with Egyptian objects to be anything but indigenous. For there is nothing in the composition of a stone bird-vase foreign to the culture of Egypt. The answer lies simply in the fact that stone vases in the shapes of animals are found outside Egypt which resemble the Egyptian objects in having a rimmed hole in the back. It is therefore assumed that there must have been direct influence of the vases of one district on the rest, or indirectly through each other. North Syria was the most central of the districts in question. Moreover it is known to have been in contact with Egypt at least as early as the First Dynasty2, and is filrther considered by Frankfort to have been influencing Elam at an even earlier date3. In spite of its being able to produce only one theriomorphic vase-and that undated-before the Hyksos period, it is therefore forced into the position of originator against the evidence. The fundamental weakness of the argument lies, how- ever, not in its development but in the initial assumption that the similarity of design necessitates a connexion. It would be at once admitted that it is natural to all peoples at early and late stages of their civilization to make vases in the shapes of animals. The important characteristic in our examples is the hole in the back with a rim of one kind or another. Now the obvious place to have the hole (for filling and emptying) in a vase which is intended to hold any quantity at all is in the top, and both these functions are assisted by a rim of some sort round the hole. In other words, if once the idea of making a vase in the shape of an animal has occurred to a number of different people, there is every chance that they will each make something on the lines of the Egyptian predynastic theriomorph and that their vases will closely resemble each other4. To see this point illustrated one has only to walk down the Greek and Roman Galleries of the British Museum where from almost every part of the classical world and widely separated periods examples of theriomorphic vases with a rimmed hole in the back are to be found5. But in case some should even here be 1 Two unpublished pottery vases in the Ashmolean should be added to this list; a rhyton with head of a bull (?) of the Eighteenth Dynasty.

In the cases of the Ethnological Department they will find convincing evidence from the two Americas and South and Central Africa. Theriomorphic vases are as common in the New World as in the Old. Their dates are far later than those of the vases we have been discussing, but in most cases they are "Pre-discovery," and in all, except a few modern pipe bowls from Central and South Africa, they are, as far as the evidence shows, indigenous. On Pls. XV and XVI are shown examples of the best illustrations of this point, for permission to publish which I have to thank Mr. T. A.

R. K. GLANVILLE It may be argued, however, that between the early stone vases of Egypt and even the most ancient of Peruvian theriomorphic vases there is a large gap in time. That does not affect the question of the possibility or rather the inevitability of any people inventing the therio- morphic vase for itself from its own genius, and at the same time on the lines of those from the early Nile culture. Moreover it may be answered by a reminder that the gap between predynastic Egypt and North Syria of the Hyksos is also a great one in time-too great at all events to be spanned by a single undated vase made of a foreign material. Finally, since we have found that this type of vase may occur almost anywhere without exterior prompting, there is no longer need to look for an origin beyond itself either for Egyptian or Syrian or Cycladic or Susian vases. There is no need for connexion: but that there may have been connexion where there is evidence for such cannot for a moment be denied. Not all peoples develop simultaneously and foreign influence may bring a new form which would have been evolved later from within. The bulk of this attempt to establish an Egyptian claim for the origin of the earliest theriomorphs has, I am afraid, been destructive, and it seems almost obligatory that one should offer some positive reconstruction of the later evidence in compensation. The opportunity for this seems to be clearly indicated in the Hyksos hawk vase (P1. XIII, Fig. 5, above). This little pottery bird has been strangely overlooked in spite of its publication by Hall as early as 1901; yet the fact that it can be definitely assigned (by the very special nature of the ware) to the Hyksos, and its unique form for that period, should alone have attracted the attention of archaeologists. The very narrow passage through the funnel-there is no other opening-must have made it difficult to pour out its contents which we may there- fore assume to have been of some value. The unusual form of the vase together with its spout, so clearly designed to prevent extravagance or waste, suggests strongly that it was a ceremonial object, probably part of the temple service. When, next, we consider the importance of the hawk in Egypt with its double significances of divinity and royalty, this theory of the vase's use might be restricted to a ritual performed by the king. More important conclusions, however, are to be drawn from the hawk. The Hyksos had already been in Egypt long enough to absorb some of the religion of the country when they made this vase, since they chose as subject the hawk, the special significance of which was peculiar to Egypt. Yet, while they were still making their own native pottery, there is no other example of an animal vase known in Hyksos pottery. The evidence there is against a North Syrian origin for that type of vase. When, in addition, we remember the tendency towards human and the absence of animal figures in the one prolific period of Syrian pottery, the known existence of animal vases in Egypt from much earlier times, and the two early Eighteenth Dynasty animal figures (p. 60 above) from Abydos, showing foreign influence, but one at least of native pottery, the evidence is very strongly in favour of the assumption that the animal or at least the bird vase was natural to Egypt. The Hyksos, however, in adapting their pottery to this new form retained an important element from Syria, which they did not find in Egypt but which is found from that time onward, especially in the human figures of alabaster, serpentine and pottery of the Eighteenth Dynasty and in one of the two animal vases (the hedgehog) from Abydos-namely the small handle attached to the spout and shoulder. This then is the real contribution from Syria'-or perhaps North Syria, we cannot yet say-and we find it in classical times and 1 Or perhaps indirectly from Cyprus vid Syria, for as Mr. Gjerstad has pointed out to me, the handle is an essentially Cypriote feature, being found both in Middle and Early Cypriote pottery. 68</page><page sequence="22">Plate XVI. 2 Theriomorphic vessels from (I) China, (2) Costa Rica, (3) Northern Rhodesia (modern), (4) Nicaragua, (5) North America (Mississipi Mounds).

It is this handle, often doubled (as here), that we have on the little Coptic cock (P1. XIV, Fig. 5), though the vase is of an essentially different nature from that of the Eighteenth Dynasty in that it has a hole in the beak besides one in the back. How far the large handle on Egyptian pottery vases which is generally stated to be Syrian in origin is really indebted to foreign influence there is not space to discuss here. It is curious, however, that a people who could invent a lug on the side of a stone vase, and pierce it, should require to have suggested to them the simple device of adding a bent strip of clay to a pot.</page></plain_text>
