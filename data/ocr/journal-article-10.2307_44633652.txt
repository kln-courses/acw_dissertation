Willems Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory Detachment THE NAVAL AEROSPACE MEDICAL RESEARCH LABORATORY DETACHMENT, New Orleans, is currently engaged in a series of experiments to determine human dynamic response to impact acceleration. Using a sled driven by a pneumatic accelerator, human volunteers and such human surrogates as large primates and anthropomorphic dummies are subjected to short duration accelera- tions approximating crash situations and their re- sponses are monitored by a wide range of measure- ment systems. These measurement systems fall into one of three main categories: Physiological, Optical, and Inertial. The physiological systems include electro- encephalography, electrocardiography, and electro- oculography. The optical systems include high speed cinematography (1)* and television. The inertial systems include sled mounted accelerometers, sub- ject mounted biaxial rate gyroscopes, and the subject mounted subminiature inertial tracking packages that are the topic of this report. Systems in the first of these categories provide time histories of the volunteer subject's electrophy- siological status while systems in the next two categories provide time histories of the impact itself * Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. as weH as the kinematic response of instrumented segments of the subjecťs anatomy. This information is required for the design and validation of anthro- pomorphic dummies and of vehicular impact protec- tion systems, and in the measurement of a crash victim's ability to perform escape or fire control maneuvers immediately after the impact. THE SYSTEM Each subminiature inertial tracking package consists in brief of six accelerometers mounted on an aluminum body that is in turn fixed to the subject anatomy. Three of these accelerometers are grouped near a single point and provide essentially, the trans - lational acceleration of that point. Two more acceler- ometers are located about a second point and, used in conjunction with the first three accelerometers provide two of the three components of angular acceleration. A single accelerometer at still another point then yields the third component of the angular acceleration. Of course, many refinements of this discussion are necessary in order to work up and implement this system, but the most concise description is that of the six- accelerometer system in a three-two-one configuration as shown in Fig. 1. These tracking packages are designed to meet a wide range of requirements. These can be grouped in three general categories: The first of these being • ABSTRACT A six-accelerometer inertial tracking package currently in intensive use in measuring living human and human surrogate response to impact acceleration is presented and discussed. The discussion includes an enumeration of the various requirements imposed upon the package as well as its design and fabrica- tion. The on-site calibration facility is described, in- cluding a discussion of the procedures for routine calibration of the packages. Accounts of the data acquisition link from the packages through the sled borne amplifiers to the hybrid computer are also included. Particular attention is devoted to the theoretical aspects of this system. A statement of errors is developed and compared to the various precision parameters of this system and to a general estima- tion of the dynamic response envelope demonstrating the overall feasibility of this approach. 3253</page><page sequence="2">3254 E.

WILLEMS ' ''si" D,MS ,N CMS Fig. 1 - The six-accelerometer system, 3-2-1 configuration the requirements imposed by the nature of human kinematic response to impact such as dynamic range, duration, bandpass, and dimensionality; the second category consists of limitations on the size, mass, rotational inertias, and mountings of the devices so that the wearing of the systems produces no signifi- cant perturbations upon the kinematic response. The final category is composed of those requirements consistent with the efficient and economical operation and maintenance of the devices. The nature of human kinematic response to im- pact acceleration has been the subject of a number of earlier studies: The joint Army-Navy- Wayne State University investigation presented by Ewing, et al, (2-4) at the 12th and 13th Stapp Car Crash Conferences and reported in NAMRL Monograph 21; work done at Holloman Air Force Base and reported by Bendixen (5) and Clarke (6); and work done at W. State University reported by Mertz and Patrick (7). In each of these studies the motions of head (and in the work reported by Ewing et al, the first tho- racic vertebral body as well) were measured in terms of the rigid body motion of some coordinate system fixed in the anatomy. Since the impact vectors were confined to the midsaggital plane, the assumption of symmetry reduces these motions to three degrees of freedom per anatomical body; two degrees of trans- lation within the midsaggital plane and a single rota- tion about an axis perpendicular to this plane. Al- though this earlier work is concerned with impact vectors situated in the subject midsaggital plane, an examination of the results suggests the following generalizations concerning human kinematic response to impact. lś The domain of response begins at the ini- tiation of impact and lasts from 200 to 350 ms. 2. The response has significant frequency components from d. c. to 30 to 50 Hz. The approximation of rigid body motion is re- tained in this current work, but a global range of impact vectors is anticipated invalidating the assump- tion of planar motion. Therefore, six kinematic parameters must be monitored for each rigid body. The problems encountered in the design and im- plementation of the anatomical mountings for these packages are too numerous and complex to be ad- dressed here. But the limitations imposed on pack- age size, mass, and rotational inertia that develop from these same anatomical considerations are the most important factors bearing on the package design. At the outset of the design phase, a choice was to be made concerning the inertial transducer types to be incorporated in the packages. A study of com- mercially available instrumentation had narrowed the design options to packages consisting solely of subminiature piezore sis tive accelerometers, or packages consisting of a number of rate gyroscopes as well as these piezoresistive accelerometers. The masses of the accelerometers are virtually negligible, but the masses of rate gyroscopes range from about 80 g for the Northrop Corp. Biaxial Rate Transducer to 100 g for the single axis Fair child and U.S. Time Devices. Accommodations for the flange mountings on these transducers could be ex- pected to add another 15 to 25 g. The result is that if nominal values for head mass and head rotational inertia about the Y axis, as in nodding, are taken as 4000 g and 2. 30 x 105 g-cm2 respectively, (as in Ref. 8), that while penalties of only 2% to 3% addi- tional mass are incurred per transducer the corres- ponding increase in rotational inertia is about 10% when the anatomical mounting is at the mouth. These additional increases in rotational inertia were deemed unacceptable, especially at the upper end of the range of impact levels included in the experimental design. The requirements consistent with the operation and maintenance of these devices call for the mini- mization of associated sled borne equipment such as amplifiers and the like and the minimization of the channels of information transmitted via hard-wire whip cable to the data collection systems. These requirements also call for modularization of the separate transducers used to instrument an anatomi- cal body. The concept of subminiature inertial tracking packages is in fact a marriage of convenience in which a number of elements are joined to produce a single albeit complex entity with associated cali- bration procedures and parameters. The initial expense necessitated by this modular concept is greater; entire modules must be maintained as backup instrumentation rather than a few extra transducers. This expense is offset by the ease with which these modules can be deployed and interchanged and by the savings in bookkeeping necessary to docu-</page><page sequence="3">3-D INERTIAL TRACKING PACKAGE 3255 Fig. 2 - Tee-rough castings and the machined surface Fig. 3 - Tee-with transducers and the final assembly ment the impact experiments. Moreover, the mini- mal physical dimensions of the piezoresistive accel- erometers has so complicated the task of locating them, that anything less than permanent mounting becomes uneconomical. The subminiature inertial tracking packages consist of six piezoresistive accelerometers fixed to a ribbed, aluminum TteeT in a rigidly controlled geometrical configuration. This Tteeł then mates mechanically in a precise and reproducible fashion with the various anatomical mountings. The rib, which is necessary to raise the natural frequency of flexural vibration above the bandwidth of the kinematic response, precludes the economical machining of these TteesT from aluminum stock in quantity; instead these TteesT are sand-cast. Then only the surface opposite the ribs need be machined Fig. 4 - Instrumented human volunteer to mate with the anatomical mountings and scribed for the accelerometer placement. The TteeT is then sent to Entran Devices where the accelerometers are custom mounted on the scribed surface. These accelerometers are available off the shelf in a variety of acceleration ranges and are damped to minimize spurious resonances providing a bandwidth from d. c. to 500 Hz or more. Since these transducers are designed for a wide range of applications in which the standards of accu- racy and linearity are not as stringent as those necessary for the tracking packages, a preselection process identifies the devices best suited for this work. Batches of accelerometers are sent to NAMRL for testing on the in-house calibration facility. Those meeting lab standards are earmarked for inclusion in the tracking packages and the entire batch is re- turned to the manufacturer. The earmarked transducers are then epoxied to the machined TteeT surface to within two thousandths of an inch of the scribed position. The temperature compensation modules are attached at convenient sites along the rib. Finally, the leads from all six accelerometers are dressed out three feet from the assembly and terminated on a single connector that mates with the sled borne amplifiers. Various stages of this work-up are shown in Figs. 2 and 3; the rough castings, the machined surface with and without transducers, and the final assembly complete with photographic targets. Fig. 4 shows an instrumented human volunteer.

This calibration facility, diagrammed in Fig. 5, consists of an Inland Controls 800 series R rate table interfaced with the E AI PacerR 600 hybrid computer used in the data acquisition system (DAS). This rate table has a twenty-four inch diameter table top and develops angular velocities of up to ten thousand degrees per second; two small turntables mounted on the rate table are used to orient the tracking packages through a wide range of alignments relative to the table's centripetal acceleration. The calibration procedures call for the package to be mounted on one of the turntables and the requi- site orientation information to be entered into the DAS. The DAS then powers up the rate table and takes readings at regularly spaced levels of centri- petal acceleration throughout the nominal ranges of the package instrumentation. This operation is re- peated for a number of different package orientations. After six or more such data sets have been col- lected, the voltage output of each transducer is com- pared to the inertial accelerations at its inertial mass to obtain a best fit for voltage bias and the components of the sensitive axis. If any of the accelerometers deviate beyond certain limits from this best fit, the package is retired until that unit is replaced. Results based on a number of these calibrations are shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 8. The rate table-computer system is itself peri- odically calibrated. A device built into the table develops an electrical pulse for each revolution. These pulses are shaped and applied to a Hewlett Packard 5330 precision time frequency interval counter to assure that the angular velocity of the table is exactly that commanded by the DAS. For acceptable accelerometers, that is, those meeting certain specified figures of merit, the final output of the calibration procedure consists of the following parameters: sensitivity, offset, direction cosines identifying true sensitive axis direction relative to</page><page sequence="5">3-D INERTIAL TRACKING PACKAGE 3257 LINEARITY CHARACTERISTICS FOR 12 50G ACCEL EROMETERS BASED ON 4 CALIBRATION SETS 1-6 PACKAGE 5103 7-12 PACKAGE 5102 © MEAN VALUE ļ STD DEVIATION .5 3 t .4- &gt; &lt; O Z ,3._ O 0 T T 1 '2~" - i I T 0 ' ,J S ł I 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 h 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ACC a EROM ETER ' Fig. 8 - Accelerometer linearity »2" HYGE FIRE MEDICAL halt CONTROL OFFICER 1 _/'_ OFFICER - ÉD 1 1 down _/'_ =FP I 1 zr-f down _ ANALOG calibróte command | | COMPUTER ' ' ñ] - I ļ ' lnertiql dato L^SLEÖVJ - IA/D| , , , , 1 ' SUBJECT I 1 T_ , DIGITAL , _ , DISK , ' | - 1 ļ icomputerlIst _ or ageI I I Tdr°cnesr" (5/71 I I QUICK I signals l /Al i I i«tl&gt;, ^ DISCONNECT I l™£!= ?À£ i i«tl&gt;, ITAPE T?pf r - ^ - tJ._jMiPLq i I l™£!= ITAPE r - FIERS STRIP [SCALED] [STRIP"!

This data is keyed to a tracking package code number and is maintained in a disk file in the DAS to be retrieved each time a package is used in a given experiment. DATA ACQUISITION The overall configuration of the DAS used in con- junction with the inertial tracking packages is depicted in Fig. 9. The subject borne transducers are con- nected directly to a set of sled-mounted signal condi- tioner/line driver amplifiers, the outputs of which are transmitted via the whip cable to the analog con- sole which filters and further amplifies the incoming signals. This console also functions as a central distribution point from which the now buffered and amplified six accelerometer outputs are transmitted not only to the A/D converter for digitization at a rate of 2000 samples per second per channel, but to auxiliary recording devices as well. The gain of a typical data path is continuously adjustable from unity to 500 under computer control. Based upon transducer sensitivity and expected dyna- mic range of a given experiment, the gain is selected so that signal-to-noise ratio is maximized. The calibration of the inertial packages has been previously discussed; the data paths are also exhaus- tively calibrated immediately prior to each experi- ment. When the sled amplifiers are commanded to the "calibrate" mode, all amplifier inputs are switched from the transducers to a common bus that provides the calibration signal. The calibrator, on command from the computer, generates a staircase (10-step) signal which is amplified and transmitted by each data path; the calibrator output is also re- turned to the computer where a comparison is made between it and each path output. Based on this com- parison, a total path gain and offset is computed for each channel, based on a least squares fit of the average of 150 samples of each step. An interesting and useful feature of the calibration subsystem is its capability for dynamic optimization of the calibration range. The program, utilizing the transducer sensi- tivity and signal path gain stored on data files, auto- matically adjusts the amplitude of the 10-step stair- case to span the expected excursions of the transducer outputs during the experiment. Once calibration is completed, the amplifiers are automatically reconnected to the transducers. Inasmuch as each active path is calibrated prior to each run, gain variations about nominal settings are inconsequential, since an exact gain (within mea- surement error) is computed. The data path para- meter of critical importance relative to overall acqui- sition accuracy is gain stability, since a gain shift between calibration and acquisition activities (nomi- nally 5-10 min) would yield errors. The gain sta- bility achieved by the NAMRL system is depicted in Fig. 10, which shows that the variability is incon- sequential. THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT The first consideration of the theoretical back- grounds of the inertial tracking packages must be the relationship between the voltage output of an accelerometer and its acceleration environment. The first assumption is that the voltage output is a function of the translational inertial acceleration of some point in the accelerometer as referenced to the accelerometer axes: Volt = F(A v x' ,A ,A ) v x' y' z' Taking an expansion around A_ = O (1)</page><page sequence="6">3258 E.

The last three of these are similar in scope and magnitude to those that would arise in the nine accelerometer system proposed by King, Padgaonkar, and Krieger (9); by Padgaonkar, Krieger, and King (10); and by Alem (11). The first of these four error terms is unique to six accelerometer systems. It arises out of the use of computationally determined angular velocities in calculating TQ T which is the centripetal, or gyro- n scopic, acceleration component being acquired by each accelerometer. ^ Breaking the equations for cj out of Eq. 12 gives: Col_CO ~ CO CO " CO 1 CO 1 p 1 ~ 1 2 3 " 2 3 1 CO 1 = CO _co co -j-co^co^+T? 2 = 213 13 2 K ' CO 1 _ CO ~ CO CO .

In the region where n^ approaches 1 however; X1 = 0 X2 = 1 &lt;21&gt; X3 = -1 By putting the eigenvalue equation in polar coordinates such that n^ corresponds to the polar axis it can be shown that XQ à is at a local minimum à and X at a local maximum, z Even so, e has components that vary as an exponential function of the angular displacement, but since this quantity is never much greater than a quarter of a revolution and is, in fact, generally much less for biodynamic impact acceleration, study of these homogeneous equations shows a worst case error of less than a five-fold increase of the initial error in angular velocity. Since the initial value of angular velocity can be so closely controlled this increase is negligible. The nonhomogeneous components of the solution to Eq. 18 for axes normal to the X axis are, as might be expected, mostly well behaved sinusoids along with the types of error that generally occur in straightforward integration. The worst case is again, rotation about the X axis. Invoking techniques from Kaplan (12), the non- homogeneous components for this case are: / Tļ dt (22) and: Exp (0) /( ( F2 + Fg) Exp ( -0 ) ) dt + r t (23) Exp (-0) J ( ( F2 - Fg) Exp (0) dt where expression (22) represents the on-axis solu- tion and (23) represents the two off-axis solutions. For angular displacements on the order of a quarter of a revolution expression (23) serves to treble or quadruple the errors that couļd be expected if it were not necessary to calculate Q using integrations of n the computed angular accelerations. But if these sources of error in F^ are minimized, as has been done by: Preselection of the inertial transducers; periodic on-site calibration of the packages; routine calibration of the data paths prior to each experiment; and on line digitization of the analog signals, then even the worst case errors in expression (23) become acceptable. EXPERIMENTAL SET UP The -G impact experiments currently in prog- ress at this^aboratory have been described in a number of reports (1, 13). The essence of these descriptions is that human volunteers equipped with anatomically mounted inertial tracking packages located at the mouth and the posterior spinous pro- cess of the first thoracic vertebral body are exposed to short duration accelerations approximating a frontal (eye balls out) crash impact. The position and orientation of the tracking packages relative to coordinate systems located in the bony anatomy of their mounting sites is measured using radiographic techniques developed at this labo- ratory. This information is then applied to the mathematical procedures already described so that the final output of the computations is the time history of the motion of the anatomical coordinate system relative to a coordinate system fixed in the laboratory. RESULTS The results of a number of these impact experi- ments have been prepared to demonstrate the work-</page><page sequence="9">3-D INERTI AL TRACKING PACKAGE 3 26 1 Fig. 1 1 - Comparison of angular velocity measured by rate gyroscope (*) and that derived from an inertial tracking package ( ) Fig. 12 - Comparison of angular velocity measured by rate gyroscope (*) and that derived from an inertial tracking package ( ) in which variations in bandpass are eliminated ability of the inertial tracking packages. Since many of the experiments include subject mounted rate gyroscopes as redundant instrumentation, a check is available on the calculated angular velocity about the subject Y axis. This axis runs approximately right to left in the body according to the definitions in reference (4) so that the motion for the head produced by such an angular velocity would be a nodding motion. The rotation produced by -G impact takes place pri- marily about this axis. Fig. 11 compares time histories of head angular velocities about this Y axis as obtained from the rate gyroscopes (*) and the inertial tracking packages (•). Since the rate gyroscopes behave as a second order low-pass filter with a natural frequency of 37 Hz, and a damping ratio of 0. 5, a similar plot was pre- pared, figure 12, in which the output from the iner- tial tracking package was altered to approximate the effect of this filtering. Off-axis components of the rotational motion are addressed by a second technique. The sensi- tivities of certain transducers were incremented or decremented by . 5% prior to calculation of the trajectories in order to generate a worst case error envelope about the solution for a 10g, -G impact. Figs. 13 through 21 show the three body-oriented angular velocities, the lab oriented three transla- tional accelerations, and the three body -oriented angular accelerations as measured and calculated for the head. Figs. 22 through 30 show the same information for T-l, the first thoracic vertebral body. The divergence of the envelope (+) and (*) from the solution (• ) for the head angular velocities at 250 milliseconds is about 5% of the peak magnitude of the head angular velocity. This divergence is much greater than that shown for the motion of T-l, and, since the head moves through an angle of 82° versus 15° for T-l, this observation bears out the conclusions concerning the effect of angular displace- ment brought out in the theoretical development. CONCLUSIONS A set of six accelerometers is sufficient to mea- sure rigid body motion for certain types of trajec- tories. The requirements for these trajectories are that angular displacement not be much greater than a quarter of a revolution and that the accelerations themselves have no sharp peaks as might be produced by striking other rigid objects. The first of these requirements is necessitated by the feedback caused by gyroscopic acceleration terms, and the second by the need for favorable scaling in minimizing the error terms in the calcula- tion. This minimization of error terms is itself made much more critical by the gyroscopic accelera- tion terms imposing the need for on-site calibration facilities as well as calibrating sensitivities as vectors rather than idealizing them in terms of orthogonal alignments. Human dynamic response to impact acceleration for cases where no direct contact with obstructions is permitted results in trajectories falling within the herein specified limits. If the problems of anatom- ically mounting such sets of six accelerometers can be overcome, i. e. those of relative motion, added mass, restrictive strapping, etc. , then the output of these transducers will yield the kinematic para- meters of the body motion.</page><page sequence="10">3262 E.
