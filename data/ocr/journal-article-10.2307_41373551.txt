<plain_text><page sequence="1">A HISTORY OF AUSTRALIAN CHILDREN'S BOOK ILLUSTRATION By Marcie Muir Melbourne (and Oxford), Oxford University Press, 1982. £21 'Remember them?' the blurb enquires, 'Bunyip Bluegum, Fatty Finn ... the Gumnut Babies . . .?' Most English readers are unlikely to do this, but for all that they should find this book entertaining as well as instructive. The author has already compiled a biblio- graphy of Australian children's literature, so her credentials are established; and in the present work she traces a history not only of developing book pro- duction but also of a country's popular mythology. Australia in its early days provided a natural market for English books: there was no notion that the colony 228 should possess a literature of its own. Not until 1841 did the first all-Australian children's book appear, A Mother's Offering To Her Children : it does not sound very exciting. But livelier fare was soon forthcoming, for the Australian bush, with its strange ñora and fauna, led to ready exploitation for the writers of adventure yarns. Indeed boys were served more readily than girls at first, for the latter, more restricted in their activities, had to make do with school stories on the English pat- tern. Only in the 1930s did books for boys and girls become widely accepted. But at least the earlier, separatist works were stoutly bound, and Marcie Muir illustrates some handsome examples here. The colouring of the early children's books had been the product, ironically, of child labour. The author provides a history of developing processes of pictorial reproduction, together with accounts of the principal artists and critical assessments of their work. The numerous (and handsomely produced) illustrations enable the reader to agree with these, or not. The range is wide, from the charming if somewhat absurd Angli- cized landscapes of the early books to the art nouveau fairies of the popular Ida Rentoul Outhwaite and so on to the relaxed sophistication of Margaret Horder and the Niland sisters. The latters' work is humorously original - Red Riding Hood becomes a squat little girl with fringe and spectacles, while the portrayal of Goldilocks' awakening by the three bears goes beyond mere anthropomorphism: the outrage on the smallest bear's face is funny, recognizable and telling. Indeed, one notes a change from solemnity to humour as the years go on. It is an encouraging sign. This is more than a pleasant picture book: it is the record of the growth of attitudes in an emerging nation. The account given of post-war children's books con- firms one's impression that it is in this field of literature, both in Britain and Australia, that the most imaginative and creative work in book production at all levels is being done. This only goes to make the author's closing words more apposite. ťThe creation of works of the imagination enriches the life of our community, and to produce quality books for our children is an act of faith.' Ignore that 'quality': the sentiment is sound. The world of children's literature, both in text and illustration, now embodies qualities increasingly absent from books ostensibly designed for adults.
