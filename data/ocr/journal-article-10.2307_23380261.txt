ISBN 1-84217-057-0 Reviewed by Edward B. Banning, Department of Anthropology, University of Toronto The recent publication of the first major report on excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan, by Yosef Garfinkel, Michele Miller, and their colleagues, is a welcome presentation of new revelations at this important Late Neolithic site. The book, which presents analyses of material from the 1989-1997 excavations and 1998 survey at Sha'ar Hagolan, and some of the results of the 1998-1999 excavations, is divided into four parts. The first deals with the site, excavations, and architecture, the second presents analyses of pottery and lithics, the third discusses art objects, while the fourth presents evidence for subsistence economy and arguments concerning the settlement's demography and social organization. In part I, contributions by Garfinkel and David Ben-Shlomo are particularly noteworthy. There, exciting evidence for domestic architecture and the spatial organization of finds comes mainly from two complexes of rooms, each built around a large courtyard and separated from its neighbours by narrow streets and alleys. Following a description of the buildings' plans and construction techniques, Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo adopt a typological and evolutionary approach, placing these buildings in the context of other early Near Eastern architecture. They argue that the Sha'ar Hagolan complexes are among the earliest examples of the Near Eastern "courtyard house," although one could argue that some of the Late PPNB buildings at such sites as Basta should be considered in this class (e.g., Nissen et al.al. 1991 : fig. 1). Other Late Neolithic examples, besides the Hassuna II one that Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo mention (2002: 76), might include a cluster of rooms at Byblos (Dunand 1973) or even some of the Samarran houses that they classify as "multipartite complex." They comment on the possibility that the complexes' inhabitants were extended families (2002: 83), and in part III on differences between two complexes in the distributions of figurines and decorated pottery that could signal "intensive social activities" in complex II (Ben-Shlomo and Garfinkel, 2002: 212). Thus they appear to recognize that adoption of the courtyard pattern had implications for the site occupants' daily activities (Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo, 2002: 78), but do not really explore evidence for use of space in these units. This is probably due to the early stage of work on these buildings, and we await further discussion of their significance in a later volume in the series. There is also discussion of village planning at Sha'ar Hagolan as compared to the organization of buildings across settlements at such sites as Nahal Oren ("free-scattered" settlement), Bouqras and Umm Dabaghiyah (arrangement around piazza), and Çatal Hiiyiik</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 213 ("condensed network"). Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo suggest that Sha'ar Hagolan, in contrast to most of these, provides an example of construction along streets. Sha'ar Hagolan certainly does appear to have convincing streets and alleys separating the house compounds. Other early examples of streets, not mentioned in this chapter, include two flagstone streets or "ramps" with stairways at 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson 1997: 293, 296, 298). More importantly, it is not yet obvious that this constitutes a planned street system, as the authors seem to imply. So far, excavations at the site are not extensive enough to demonstrate that Sha'ar Hagolan had a formal street system rather than the "organic" type of system that results in many modern cases of vernacular architecture; what Hillier and Hansen (1984) would call their "z3 syntax." This chapter might well have benefited from reference to Hillier and Hansen's space-syntax approach. Although theirs is certainly not the only way to classify and interpret the organization of space in villages, it has the benefit of identifying the structural rules — and often, by extension, the behavioral processes — that explain the patterns, and are not influenced by buildings' geometric shapes. Adopting this approach would show that many of the rectilinear buildings in the PPNB and Late Neolithic are organized in settlements in exactly the same way as the simple round ones of earlier periods, and usually by one of Hillier and Hansen's "distributed" syntaxes, which require no centralized planning. Thus, it seems premature to conclude that Sha'ar Hagolan has a "most sophisticated site plan, with a network of streets including a central, straight street" (Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo 2002: 82). Part II of the Sha'ar Hagolan report provides detailed information about the ceramic and lithic assemblages there. As in Garfinkel's previous works, there is a laudable attempt to provide quantitative information about the pottery, and typology follows the system used at Munhata, based on overall form, size, form details, and sometimes decoration, which facilitates comparisons with that site (Garfinkel and Miller 2001: 102-104). There are many well executed illustrations, and each illustrated sherd's context (locus and basket) appears in the tables of artifact descriptions, while another table compares the distributions of pottery types in the two main building complexes. However, the smallest contextual units in the latter table are rooms and, until the authors publish the site in more detail, it will be difficult to determine where most of the contexts are or what their stratigraphie relationships might be. There is useful quantitative comparison of this site's ceramic assemblage with that of Munhata, showing that food serving may have been more important at the former. Food service is also consistent with the relatively high proportion of decoration at the site. Short chapters by Cohen-Weinberger and Zuckerman make brief statements on the ceramic petrography and on experiments in pottery replication. Overall, the discussion of pottery from the site is very useful and meets or exceeds the standard of publication of most Late Neolithic sites to date.</page><page sequence="3">214 BOOK REVIEWS Chapters on the lithic technology, conjoinable lithics, and ground-stone tools inform us about raw material acquisition and core reduction patterns, describe the characteristics of the formal tools in a typological framework, and provide evidence on the spatial distribution of activities (Alperson and Garfinkel 2002: 174-75; Matskevich 2002: 180). They characterize the technology as rather opportunistic, based mainly on flake production from single-platform cores made from river pebbles. It is interesting, however, that there was some more standardized blade technology and they even find some indication that opposed-platform blade removal, similar to the use of naviform cores at PPNB sites, survived into the Pottery Neolithic at this site (Alperson and Garfinkel 2002: 148). The lithics are well illustrated but, unlike the pottery, are presented only typologically, with no indication of their spatial or stratigraphie context beyond brief discussion of spatial patterns and conjoinable pieces. In presentation of the spatial distributions, furthermore, the lithics are also grouped typologically. This provides useful evidence, for example, of a possible knapping area in one room of building I, but does not allow us to put individual artifacts into their contexts. Garfinkel provides a brief chapter on "the stone tools" that summarizes the typology and distribution of ground-stone objects from excavations at the site. Given the great importance of some of these tools for changes in economic organization in the Neolithic, a more detailed treatment of this class of tools in a future volume would be very welcome. The weights, in particular, will have fascinating implications for developments in agricultural and textile production. As with the chipped lithics, these artifacts are divorced from their contexts and, as Allen (2002: 243) notes later in the volume, the association between grinding implements and plant remains, for example, could be revealing. Part III of Garfinkel and Miller's book, in keeping with the book's title, has several chapters that deal with the art objects' typology, construction, spatial distribution, and possible function. In many ways, this is the most interesting part of the book, as Sha'ar Hagolan provides such a wealth of evidence for this class of material culture. Two chapters provide detailed discussion of the manufacture of clay figurines, including one unusual, oversized figurine or statue. This is extrememly important because it has implications for who made these objects and for what purpose. Although the authors do not adopt an explicitly chaîne opératoire approach, there is enough detail here that others may be able to interpret the figures in that way. That there was some variety in technique and material, they argue, suggests that many different individuals participated in the production of clay figures, and that these were the same people who also produced pottery (Garfinkel et al. 2002: 190-91 ; Applbaum and Applbaum 2002: 219). One of these chapters also briefly outlines the techniques and typology of the incised pebble figurines, but leaves many questions unanswered. Garfinkel et al. (2002: 206 207) suggest that there is some kind of relationship between the clay figures and the</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 215 pebble figures, which helps in the interpretation of both. But why two such different classes of figures if they had much the same function? When was it appropriate to make or use a pebble figurine, rather than a clay one? Or was the choice simply a function of the makers' different skills? Michele Miller's (2002) chapter on the function of anthropomorphic figurines attempts to deal with questions such as these. Miller considers function in two dimensions, use and meaning. In an attempt to discover how and by whom the figurines were used, Miller emphasizes aspects of consistency in manufacture, rather than the differences, as well as their spatial distribution. In contrast with the claims made in a previous chapter, Miller argues that only a small number of skilled potters could have made the clay figurines, and may have been specialists, perhaps shamans or healers, as Vitelli (1995) had suggested in the case of figurines from Frachthi Cave. The pebble figurines, according to this argument, were then substitutes made by people who lacked the skills to make the clay ones (Miller 2002: 223). The wide distribution of both classes of figurine in domestic contexts indicates that their use was widespread, even if there are some differences in frequency among house compounds, and pebble figurines seem to have been more broadly distributed than the others. I am left with the impression, however, that other evidence could still contribute to these questions. It would be very interesting to try and associate the production steps outlined in the previous chapters with possible ritual activities. Was anything, such as hair, perhaps, ever incorporated into the figurines? Are there any patterns in damage to figurines, as some authors have suggested for PPNB ones (McAdam 1997; Morsch 1997), that might be consistent with the ritual killing or other treatment of these items? Could evidence for other materials from the same context as the figurines provide any clues to the circumstances of their discard? Miller's consideration of their meaning focusses on the prominent portrayal of eyes, other facial features, body features and posture, costume, and red coloring. Her symbolic interpretations depend on the repetition of symbols on different classes of object, such as figurines and pottery, as well as on their form. She associates the cowry-like shape of the eyes with fertility, the ample lower body and seated position with sedentism and stability, and the dress and and oddly-shaped heads with ceremonial costume or regalia. While recognizing their probable multifuncionality, Miller (2002: 212) favors their interpretation as representations of a female deity that served to strengthen group identity and cohesion. Overall, this is a well-balanced discussion, but somewhat oddly makes little use of comparisons with similar figurines elsewhere. If they represent a deity or deities, one wonders how they compare with figurines from Samarran and 'Ubaid sites, for example, whose probable historical continuity with Sumerian culture might provide clues to the</page><page sequence="5">216 BOOK REVIEWS deities' identities {cf. Schmandt-Besserat 1998). And what of the competing interpretation of earlier Neolithic figures as ghosts (Schuster 1997)? The final section offers preliminary reports on plant and animal remains and a study of population size and architectural evidence for social organization. As evidence for Yarmoukian plant use has been very scarce, the large-scale sampling for plant remains is extremely welcome, even if it has not been possible to maintain consistent methods over the field seasons. I applaud the use of density measures for the plant remains, but would caution against the claim that ubiquity, also presented, "removes the bias resulting from differences in sample volume" (Allen 2002: 239). Ubiquity is not a measure of abundance, can be just as subject to bias, and is particularly sensitive to sample-size problems (see Kadane 1988). The results, however, show good evidence for cereals, pulses, weeds, figs and other fruit and nuts, and we eagerly wait further evidence of this kind as the excavations continue. The chapter on faunal remains (Hesse 2002) exhibits the typical range of Neollithic animals, dominated by sheep and goats, but goes on to attempt mortality curves and to discuss the spatial distribution of species and carcass parts. The concluding chapter attempts to associate population growth at Sha'ar Hagolan with its architectural organization, arguing that the courtyard houses reflect the need to replace a two-tier with a three-tier hierarchy (Garfinkel 2002). This strikes me as an overly simplistic characterization, particularly at this stage of the project, and further work will need to take greater account of the large literature on scalar stress and the relationship between social structure and architecture. However, the short paper does outline many of the factors that will ultimately lead Garfinkel to understand these domestic arrangements more thoroughly. I am glad to see in this chapter that he is pulling together the variety of evidence that will be needed to do so. This will be an essential volume for anyone with research interests in the Levantine Neolithic, and I look forward to further volumes in the series. REFERENCES Dunand M. 1973. Fouilles de Byblos V.
