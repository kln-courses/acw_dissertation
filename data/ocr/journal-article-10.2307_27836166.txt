<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Life of the Rainbow Lizard by V. A. Harris; 174 pages; 21s; Hutchinson &amp; Co., Ltd., London, 1964. Notice of this monograph seems de sirable for it is a welcome addition to the several attempts in recent years by too few herpetologists to provide what is in each author's judgment a compre hensive account of the biology of a species of reptile. The present work is the result of six years of observations, most of which were made on Agama agama living on the grounds of the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. Also included are observations on Agama populations living under different eco logical conditions in Lagos and Zaria. Identification of individual lizards was based on guiar pattern recorded by photographs and color coding with paint. According to Harris the guiar pattern appears to be as specific to his lizards 376A</page><page sequence="2">as the fingerprint is to man. Most of this study is concerned with behavior, but there is information on thermal rela tions in a chapter entitled "A Place in the Sun" and structure of the integu ment is discussed under "A Coat of Many Colours." There is a short chap ter on natural populations. Such chapter headings give some indication of the tone of this readable account. The author's style, which he says may appear anthropomorphic, is undoubt edly aimed at wider circulation. It is sure to be offensive to some. It is not my purpose in this brief note to discuss the controversial subject of territoriality which occupies much of this work or to point out the areas where there is a lack of information on the life history of Agama. The latter will be obvious to those that search for them. However, it should be mentioned that the monograph is not without error. A paper by Charles M. Bogert pre sumably (1949, Evolution 3 (3) 195 211) is cited erroneously on page 53 and is not to be found among the list of references. With regard to the review of the literature, the paper of A. J. Mar shall and R. Hook (1960), Proc. Zool. Soc. Land., 134, 197-205 on reproduc tion of Agama seems pertinent but is not among the list of references. Agama agama is a lizard of more than casual interest to students of reptiles, and Harris presents much information of value. The attractive format, construc tion, and price of this monograph are a credit to the publishers.?P. Kennedy</page></plain_text>
