Brill, 1985. Gld. 82. This volume brings the publication of the Leiden edition of the Peshitta past the half-way stage. All fifteen known manuscripts pre-dating ad 1200, plus four palimpsests and eight lectionaries (but no massoretic manuscripts) are described in detail in the introduction and fully collated. Textually, the manuscripts divide into two main groups: (i) those earlier than ad 800, plus 9a1, and (ii) the remaining ninth-century and all later manuscripts. No textual distinction appears between Nestorian and Jacobite witnesses. All the former and many of the latter stand in group (ii), which seems to represent a text-type current before the schism of ad 483/4; at 13: 10, the reading of the younger manuscripts, against that of the older, appears in Aphraates (ed. Parisot, I 16). The older manuscripts show, however, that other text-types too existed even in those early centuries. Many variants are discussed by Prof. Mulder in a paper ('Some Remarks on the Peshitta Translation of the Book of Ezekiel') in the forthcoming proceedings of the Leiden symposium of 1985 on the Peshitta. On the whole the tradition is remarkably uniform. Where the manuscripts diverge, the text presents whichever reading is supported by at least three manuscripts that pre-date ad 1000; if there is more than one such reading, that found in 7a 1 is preferred. (Yodh is misprinted as Nun at 4: 7 ttyb and 48: 35ywmyh). In most cases this rule gives the reading of the original translation. (Even at 22: 9, where the rule is ignored, it would have given bek(y), which better suits MT bdk than does the preferred reading b-gawek(y).)b-gawek(y).)b-gawek(y).) Sometimes, however, the rule leads to the inferior reading, or at least to one distant from the MT. For example, the main text omits the phrases 'and I shall be for them a God' (37: 27) and 'the pilaster of (41: 3), which appear in the MT and are well attested in both groups of Pesh. manuscripts. At 41: 21, again, mrab'd, for MT rebu'dh,rebu'dh, appears in only two of the pre-1000 manuscripts, but is preferable to its rival ma'arbd. Occasionally, as in other books, the true reading may survive in Codex 9a 1 alone, which often agrees uniquely with the MT (e.g. at 36: 32 in lacking w-ld tmutun, probably an intrusion from 33: 11). Again, the younger group of manuscripts sometimes has the likelier reading: at 45: 23, for example, they alone take the sin-offering to be the goat, as in the MT, and not the rams, as in the older manuscripts; again in 20: 8 and 44: 3, the younger manuscripts alone share the word order of the MT. More often the younger manuscripts—followed by the Polyglots and Lee but not by the text of the new edition—have the inferior reading, e.g. the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 465 repetition of tab at 27: 25, da-smayd for d-gepd at 39: 4 (MTkdndp), and the transposition of 'east' and 'west' at 48: 17 (here the Polyglots etc. have yet another order). Some of the more attractive readings of the Polyglots—e.g. d-dakitek(y) (24: 13), kasyd (27: 19) and '100' before amin at 42: 2—are now seen to be emendations, or at least to lack manuscript support earlier than ad 1200. The translator strove for an idiomatic rather than a literal translation, and did not hesitate to omit words or phrases that he found redundant or unintelligible. Thus in 33: 5 only the last four words are rendered. Other difficulties were ingeniously resolved by changes of grammatical elements, and by guesses from the context. Many instances of these features were listed by C. H. Cornill, Das Buck Buck des Propheten Ezechiel, Leipzig 1886, pp. 148-153, while Mulder ('Remarks') examines Chaps. 27 and 37 in depth. Where retroversion of Pesh. into Hebrew yields a text different from the MT, it may nevertheless be that the translator mentally emended a Vorlage identical with the MT; for example, hap-penimit (8: 3) and miptan (9: 3) become 'corner' (pinndh), and 'ebat (25: 15) becomes 'love' {,ahdbat).{,ahdbat). Sometimes a Hebrew word is rendered by a similar but unrelated Syriac word, e.g. kasyd for Heb. maskitd (8:12), dawqe for Heb. ddyeq (17: 17). Cornhill also noted (pp. 153 f.) many striking parallels with LXX, e.g. 'sapphire girdle' for MT qeset has-sdper (9: 2), and considered that the translator consulted LXX. That view is challenged by Mulder ('Einige Beobachtungen zum Peschittatext von Ezechiel in seinem Beziehungen zum masoretischen Text, zur Septuaginta und zum Targum', Salvacion en la Palabra (in memory of A. Diez Macho), Madrid 1986, pp. 463-470). However, the parallels cannot all be attributed (as Mulder suggests) to a common Vorlage Vorlage diverging from the MT or to coincidence; and LXX seems sometimes to have been treated with a freedom that is more easily ascribed to the translator than to later revision. Thus as 24: 23, MT has u-pe erekem 'al rasekem, LXX translates 'and your hair (komai) upon your heads', and Pesh. writes 'and your hair shall not be cut'. Yet despite all the difficulties in reconstructing the translator's Hebrew Vorlage,Vorlage, Pesh. remains an invaluable textual and exegetical source. For example, NEB's rendering 'which had the power of sight' for MT w-yirdhw-yirdh Idhem (1: 18) goes back to Pesh. {w-hdzydn hway), and 'Sabaeans' for MT sdbd'im (23: 42) likewise reflects Pesh. The Peshitta of Ezekiel is separated from that of Isaiah and Jeremiah by lexical features—the consistent use of mdi(n)td rather than qritd for Heb. 'lr, and of mare mdrawdtd (after the Kethib) rather than mdryd aldhd (after the Qere) for Heb. 'dddndy YHWH. Two more renderings found in Ezekiel but not in Isaiah and Jeremiah appear also in the Pentateuch: yaqdd salmd for Heb. 'dldh (a caique</page><page sequence="3">466 REVIEWS on Greek holokautoma) and (ayna) d-metpne lwdt(y) 'he that turns unto me' for Heb.ger (probably an interpretation of Greekproselutos, which means 'one who comes towards' without specifying the object). The combination of all four features of the translation of Ezekiel, however, recurs only in the Peshitta of the Twelve Prophets, which perhaps stems from the same translator. The Peshitta of Ezekiel contains some thirty loan words or caiques from Greek, but none from Latin, even though certain other books show Latin borrowings (e.g. tabldrd,tabldrd, qdrokd). The increase in Greek influence by comparison with the Pentateuch may be gauged from the list of nine gems in 28:13. All nine occur also in Exod. 28: 17-20,39: 10-13, where eight of the Peshitta's renderings are Semitic words and only one is of Greek origin; in Ezekiel, however, the Peshitta uses eight Greek loanwords (the remaining term is not translated), of which four appear in the LXX on that verse. Whether the Peshitta is of Jewish or Christian origin is an old question, which must be considered separately for each book. In Ezekiel some features recall Jewish targums. The translation of halldnothalldnot 'dtumdt (40: 16) by 'windows broad inside and narrow outside' reflects a Jewish interpretation of 1 Kings 6: 4. At 44: 26, the view that a defiled priest was barred from the temple until seven days had elapsed from his defilement and not (as in the MT) from his purification agrees with a tannaitic saying in TB Moed Qatan 15b. Prophecy is said to come from before God (33: 30), and similarly men worship (44: 13, 46: 4), or for that matter sin (14: 13, 20: 27, 43: 9), before him. God's eye is omitted at 9: 10, and Cornill noted the substitution of 'anger' for the 'face' of God. Cornill found two further renderings that avoided disrespect to God ('and ye defiled my people' [13: 19], 'and ye were cast after your idols' [23: 35]). For hdquqim hdquqim bas-sdsarbas-sdsar (23: 14), Pesh. agrees verbally with the Targum (sirin b-sammdne),b-sammdne), and a few other such agreements are discussed by Cornill and by Mulder ('Beobachtungen'). Again, three of the oldest manuscripts note that the second half of Ezekiel begins at 26: 1, as in the Hebrew Massorah. Some other features of the translation, however, contrast with known Jewish versions. The reference to evil statutes given by God (20: 25), and the coarse language of Chaps 16 and 23, are literally translated. An anthropomorphism is created at 1: 27 and 8: 2, where the 'en (ha-)hasmal(dh) (MT), the like of which Ezekiel beheld, becomes 'the sight of God'. Similarly Peshitta introduces God's arms and face at 21: 21. There are hints of a negative attitude towards Israel. At 35: 5, Heb. 'dwdn qes (referring to Israel's former sufferings) is rendered 'the iniquity of their [Israel's] end'. In 37: 12, 13, Peshitta omits 'my people' as those to whom resurrection is</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 467 promised. There is some ignorance, or nonchalance, regarding the law. The guilt-offering and the peace-offering are always called merely qurbana. At 45:20 Peshitta writes: 'and a foolish erring man shall do so' (i.e. sacrifice in the temple); the other ancient versions avoid such disrespect. At 45: 24, the ephah is called one seah, rather than (as in Mishnah Men. 6: 6) three. The rendering 'fins' rather than 'scales''scales' for qasqeset (29:4) shows imperfect recollection of Lev. 11:9. The varying translation of the Hebrew phrase 'dwell in betah' also deserves note. Gog and his victims, including sinful Israel, once dwelt in in selya (38:8-39: 26); restored Israel, however, will dwell in sabrd, a translation going back to the verbal sense of bth and so meaning 'hope, trust, faith' (28: 26, 34: 27-28). Whether the Peshitta version of Ezekiel, which entered the Bible of the Syriac church, originated among Christians or within some (probably non-rabbinic) form of Judaism, is still uncertain. Clearly, however, this authoritative edition is an indispensable source not only for the biblical text but also for early eastern Christianity. M. P. Weitzman Μ. P. Weitzman</page></plain_text>
