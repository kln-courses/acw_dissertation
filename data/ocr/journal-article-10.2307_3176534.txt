<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thomas A. Wilson SACRIFICE AND THE IMPERIAL CULT OF CONFUCIUS A principal duty of the Chinese court was to provide ritual feasts for the gods and spirits at imperial altars and temples. From ancient times to the early twentieth century, the emperor regularly offered a ritual feast-or sacrifice (ji)-to Heaven and Earth, the royal ancestors, the gods of grains and soils, sun and moon, stars, and other gods and spirits that reigned over different realms of the cosmos. Ritual officers stationed throughout the empire venerated local deities, such as wind and clouds, mountains and rivers, city gods and the spirits of the banners that hung at cardinal locations throughout the city. Sacrifice was part of a complex relation- ship between men and gods based upon mutual dependency. Farmers tended the fields and herds, and the ritual officers of the court presented the fruits of human labor to the gods. Nourished by the reverence of propitiation and sustenance of the sacrifices, the gods requited (bao) the living with blessings (fu) of fecundity. In postclassical times, and con- tinuing throughout the imperial era,l ritual officers also sacrificed to the I wish to express my gratitude to Benjamin Elman, Michael Nylan, Buzzy Teiser, Sue Naquin, Kathryn McClymond, Kevin Grant, Lisa Trivedi, and participants in a series of workshops at the Institute for Advanced Study during 1999-2000.

The imperial era is subdivided into early (221 B.C.E.-420 C.E.), middle (420-960), and late (960-1911). "Classical" refers to the Zhou (1027-221 B.C.E.).

As the domain of the cosmos over which Confucius presided, culture (wen) encompassed the imperium and its orderly operations based on the teachings of the ancient sage-kings as recorded in the Confucian canon. This culture was embod- ied in the Confucian literati devoted to the primacy of ritual and music, which gave perfect expression to human sentiments and generated the orderly principles (wen) that governed the human world. In this essay I examine the liturgy of the sacrifice to Confucius as it was performed during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dy- nasties and the classical sources used to construct it. The first section describes the classical pantheon of gods and spirits and the logic of sacrifice that venerated the gods. The second section examines efforts to situate the cult of Confucius in the classical pantheon and the conten- tious search for canonical precedents during the early centuries of the formation of the cult. The third section analyzes several key features of the sacrifice itself. My account of the rites draws from ritual treatises and liturgical texts compiled by court authorities during the imperial era and the classical ritual canons called the Record of Rites (Liji) and the Rites of Zhou (Zhouli), which date, in their present form, to the long period from the Warring States era (475-221 B.C.E.) to the Western Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.-25 C.E.). In the last section I consider the implications of sacrifice on the question of Confucianism as a religion. My discussion of Confucian sacrifice in the third section focuses on two important concerns: the disposition of the sacrificer produced through purification rites of fasting and the conception of the victim that is offered as part of the ritual feast. I draw comparisons with ritual tradi- tions outside of China to interrogate what the sources say about imperial Chinese sacrifice in particular and also the assumptions that we may bring to our understanding of the nature of sacrifice as such. In their pioneering book, Sacrifice: Its Nature and Functions, Henry Hubert and Marcel Mauss attempt to formulate a universal theory of sacrifice based primarily on Vedic rituals. They make two significant claims in their theory of sacrifice that are pertinent to this study: (1) the sacrificer real- izes a state of purity through expiatory rites that precede the offering and (2) the victim plays the central sacramental role of mediator between gods and the mortals who render sacrifice.2 By privileging religions that are, at least in aspiration, monotheistic, Hubert and Mauss's universal theory begins to break down when applied to ritual traditions that serve many gods simultaneously, in which the living have a variety of different 2 Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss, Sacrifice: Its Nature and Functions (Chicago: Univer- sity of Chicago Press, 1964), pp. 19-45, first published as "Essai sur la nature et le fonc- tion du sacrifice" (1898). 252</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions kinds of relationships with the gods, or in which the gods are not con- strued as occupying a position in which they can expiate sin. Rather than dismiss the work by Hubert and Mauss, or indeed comparative method- ologies, I complicate our understanding of sacrifice on the basis of a ritual tradition that does not fit neatly into the paradigms that have dominated research on sacrifice. Toward the end of this essay, I argue that (1) the Con- fucian sacrificer's state of purity is defined by a single-minded concen- tration upon the spirit that is to receive the feast and does not entail expiation of sin and (2) the victim in Confucian sacrifice is part of a lar- ger feast to feed the gods so that the cosmos is properly maintained. Thus the victim's slaughter does not mark a culminating moment of the rite. THE PANTHEON OF IMPERIAL CHINA The imperial pantheon3 was a meticulously regulated hierarchical nexus of cults that extended from the temples and altars in the capital to the county level throughout the empire. Imperial cults were bureaucrati- cally distinct from those of Buddhism, Daoism, and popular religion in that they were serviced by officers of the court and bureaucracy and sanctioned by the Confucian canon. The Ministry of Rites and the Court of Imperial Sacrifice regulated these cults through promulgation of the calendar of sacrifice and management of the liturgies performed and the foods sacrificed. In most cases the court restricted access to the imperial pantheon on the basis of civil service rank,4 although in Ming times village heads-who were commoners-offered sacrifices to the gods of soils and grains (sheji) and abandoned ghosts (litan).5 The court condoned many popular cults by approving certain levels of sacrifice to and conferring noble titles upon the gods worshiped in local temples,6 but it was always vigilant of the disruptive activities associated with 3 I use the term imperial pantheon here to denote the gods and spirits listed in the Rites of Zhou and in dynastic registers of sacrifice. Although the Chinese gods were never gath- ered in a single building such as in the Roman Pantheon, Roman and Chinese sources share a conception of the gods as a whole. The Roman Pantheon did not include all gods, only the highest. Cassius Dio believed that the name pantheon derived from the vaulted ceiling of the building, which resembled the shape of the heavens.

The court's ambivalence toward popular cults is saliently embodied in the figure of Confucius, who stood on the steps of his ancestral hall dressed properly in court robes while the locals per- formed exorcism rituals outside. He could not but tolerate such non- canonical rites, but he also needed to reassure his ancestors that no harm would come to them.7 The five rites of the ritual canons. According to late Zhou and Han sources, ritual permeated all aspects of life, from interactions at court and relations among royalty and commoners in society, to communion with the gods and spirits. The Rites of Zhou describes five types of ritual, each with its own kind of ceremony, degree of solemnity or celebration, and circumstance that affected the celebrant's frame of mind, corporeal disposition, and status in relation to others, both human and ethereal. Two types of ritual, the "joyous rites" (jiali) of capping and marriage and the "inauspicious rites" (xiongli) of mourning and burial of the dead, had enduring and profound effects upon the everyday lives at all levels of Chinese society. Two other types of ritual were more closely bound up with the royal court and the social elites of ancient and imperial China: "military rites" (junli) unified the feudal lords through regimentary mili- tary formations and "guest rituals" (binli) regulated the king's inter- actions with court nobles and lords. The "auspicious rites" (jili) defined man's relationship to the gods and spirits through rituals of sacrifice (jisi).8 Virtually all ritual treatises from the classics to later dynastic his- tories concurred with and usually quoted the laconic statement in the Record of Rites: "There are five ritual constants, none is more important than sacrifice."9 The five types of rituals ordered a myriad human endeavors, only one of which was overtly "religious" in the sense of rites that defined relations between humans and gods. The absence of the word "religion" in the Chi- nese language before the nineteenth century, and the existence of many precise terms for particular kinds of sacrificial offering, should alert us to the complex ways that the activities Western scholars tend to group together under the rubric of religion are themselves distributed and dis- persed throughout some societies in uneven and unpredictable ways.

Ritual shaped and guided peoples' lives in a continuum of secular and sacred activities, such as initiation into adulthood, marriage, receiving important guests, mourning the dead, and propitiation of the deities that affect the living's relations with the cos- mos. Yet gods and spirits were routinely invoked as witnesses to other- wise seemingly secular ceremonies, which renders useless and misleading any moder distinction between "secular," as the social or political, and "sacred," either as ritual sacrifice to gods or as salvific spiritual quest.10 The liturgy of the auspicious rites. The pantheon of deities and spir- its served by the auspicious rites was headed by Heaven and Earth, and followed by a number of celestial gods, such as the sun, moon, and stars, as well as terrestrial gods, such as the royal ancestors, the gods of soils and grains, and the five sacred peaks.ll According to the Rites of Zhou, the flesh of the victim offered to celestial gods had to be rendered into smoke so that the gods could receive the sacrifice. Thus the Rites of Zhou prescribes a smoke offering (yinsi) in sacrifices to "Lofty Heaven Lord on High" (Haotian shangdi) and a "bonfire full with the body of the victim" in sacrifices to the sun, moon, and stars.12 The "Methods of Sac- rifice" (jifa) chapter of the Record of Rites also explains, "roasted bonfire offerings on the great altar (tai tan) is to sacrifice to Heaven, buried offerings at the great altar (tai zhe) is to sacrifice to Earth. A reddish brown calf (xingdu) is used."13 These smoke and burnt offerings to ce- lestial gods were to be presented in open spaces to ensure that the gods had unhindered access. Lofty Heaven Lord on High thus received the sacrifices at the open circular mound (because Heaven was round) in the 10 The liturgies of the five rites were not rigidly separated, particularly on the level of specific elements of larger ceremonies. Music and dance were a key feature of military formations and foods and their vessels were used in guest rituals and joyous celebrations. The commentaries on Analects 10.9 cite the example of the use of sacrificial meat called shenfan (Lunyu zhengyi 12.223) in nonsacrificial ways. Shen is raw meat offered to the god of soils, andfan is cooked meat offered to the royal ancestors.

The Han court offered a separate sacrifice to Heaven and Shangdi at least twice: once in 89 B.C.E. (Wudi zhenghe 4/3/13) and again in 4 C.E. (Pingdi yuanshi 4/1), otherwise it sacrificed to both jointly as "Haotian shangdi" at a single altar. Han shu, ed. Ban Gu (76 C.E.; reprint, Beijing: Zhon- ghua shuju, 1962), 6.207, 12.356.

A blood sacrifice was offered to terrestrial gods such as grains and soils and "buried offerings" (lichen) were used to sacrifice to mountains and forests, rivers and lakes. The blood of the vic- tim was buried in sacrifices to terrestrial gods, usually outside of the en- closed temple used for such sacrifices.14 The difference between celestial and terrestrial deities, marked by the use of smoke versus blood sacrifice, had less to do with the deities' rank or prestige than with the problem of facilitating their access to the offerings. The cults of ancient times were also divided into three tiers. The Rites of Zhou distinguishes among great sacrifices (dasi), at which jade, silk, and an unblemished animal victim (bo shengquan) were offered;15 sec- ondary sacrifices (cisi), at which an animal victim and a bolt of cloth (shengbi) were offered; and minor sacrifices (xiaosi), at which an animal victim was offered. The commentary explains that the great sacrifices were offered to Heaven and Earth and the royal ancestors; the second- ary sacrifices were offered to the gods of soils and grains, the five sacrifices (wusi),16 the five sacred peaks, sun, moon, and stars; and the minor sacrifices were offered to the master of fate (siming), the master of talent and accomplishment (sizhong), masters of wind (fengshi) and rain (yushi), mountains and streams, and lords of the hundred animals.17 Since the rites and offerings for cults within each tier were the same, no particular symbolic significance about any one cult can be inferred from a ritual or offering. The type of offerings-such as whether an ox was offered-the number of rows of ritual dancers, and so on, were markers of rank in the spirit hierarchy; a particular offering or ritual ges- ture symbolized nothing beyond the efficacy of the feast offering. The level of the feast offering marked the status of the sacrificer as well, for only the emperor or high court officials acting as his surrogate were per- mitted to offer an ox as sacrifice.18 14 "Dazong bo" Zhouli zhengyi 33.48; Zhouli zhushu 18.120. Commentaries read the character li/fox as mai/buried (Zhouli zhengyi 33.49). Jin E notes that sacrifices to Earth, like those to soils and grains, were blood offerings (Zhouli zhengyi 33.50). 15 The Rites of Zhou prescribes use of a light green jade disc with a square hole at the center (cangbi) to sacrifice to Heaven and an eight-cornered yellow jade with a round hole (huangzong) to sacrifice to Earth (Zhouli zhengyi 18.124). 16 The five sacrifices are archaic sacrifices to spirits that were eventually linked to the five phases: door/wood, stove/fire, middle pillar/earth, gate/metal, and well/water.

The division between great sacrifices and the other two tiers was strictly observed until the twentieth century by allowing only the emperor to perform great sacri- fices.21 More recent cults that had no counterparts in the classics tended to be ranked as middle-level sacrifices, which were performed by high- ranking members of the court and bureaucracy. The details of standard- izing the liturgies of the three tiers continued during the Tang (618-907) period and were changed only occasionally in subsequent periods.

Wei Cheng (636; reprint, Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1973), 6.117. This three- tiered division was periodically invoked before then (e.g., Songshu, ed. Shen Yue [Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1971], 17.478), but it was not institutionalized until the early seventh century. I leave aside questions of whether one may rightly infer that such institutions existed before they were said to appear in the official chronicles; whether such ritual dis- tinctions may have informally guided bureaucratic practice even without such formal in- stitutionalization (i.e., this system may have actually existed before the late sixth century); or, contrariwise, whether one ought to assume that the descriptions of these institutions are anything other than expressions of imperial desire for such structures in the face of their absence. 20 Sacrifices to the gods of soils and grains are an important exception among cults of the great sacrifice. There was considerable disagreement over the identity of she (god of soils) as well as its relation to ji (the god of grains). Huang Yizhou summarizes several po- sitions: she was a great spirit (dashi), an earth spirit (tushi), Lord Earth (houtu), or simply sheji. Huang speculates that the first two are probably one in the same and that the earth spirit is the spirit of the five soils (wudi zhi shi). Lishu tonggu (Huangshi Shiguan, 1893; reprint, Jingmei, Taiwan: Huashi chubanshe, 1977), 13.1a-2a. According to another source, she and ji received sacrifices at one she altar in the Han and Wei (Songshu 17.478). More- over they were classed as middle sacrifices in the Tang (Xin Tang shu 11.310). Some memorialists in the early Ming argued that she and ji were originally men and should be worshiped separately, others held that they represented the five soils and grains and should be worshiped together. The latter position prevailed. She and its correlate, Lord Earth Gou- long (Houtu goulong), received sacrifices at its own altar, followed by Ji and its correlate, Lord Millet (Houji), all in the same altar complex. Da Ming huidian, comp. Li Dongyang and Shen Shixing (1587; reprint, Taibei: Xinwen feng chuban gongsi, 1976), 85.1a. Evi- dence that she and ji were also local gods can be seen in the fact that local officials of the bureaucracy and village heads made sacrifices to them at local temples as well as the emperor's sacrifices to them at the imperial temple inside the forbidden city.

In 1368, the first year of the Ming dynasty, for instance, the court pre- scribed twelve vessels for Heaven, Earth, the imperial ancestors, and ten for soils and grains, all of which were otherwise great sacrifices.23 Against this backdrop of structural constancy the pantheon accommo- dated the addition of new cults during the imperial era.24 In the early years of the Chinese empire, Han emperors traveled throughout the realm to offer sacrifices to local spirits at ancestral halls of prominent and accomplished persons. Such local sacrifices were not ancestral since the emperors were not blood descendants of these men. Nor were they part of the classical pantheon since they were not mentioned in the canonical books. The cult of Confucius began as a local cult celebrated by Con- fucius's biological descendants and his doctrinal heirs. An examination of court debates over how to integrate the cult of Confucius into the clas- sical pantheon of gods provides a number of important insights into the nature of imperial sacrifice. First, inclusion in the imperial pantheon required classical precedent in order to authorize the cult and to identify the precedents that determined most questions concerning the new cult's liturgy. Second, while a new cult was legitimated by the canon, cults such as that of Confucius in turn legitimated the interests of certain seg- ments of the population. But, while the interests of the Confucian liter- ati were served by this cult, the extent of controversy over the various details of the cult underscores the internally contested and variegated na- ture of literati interests. Finally, to take sacrifice seriously for what it pur- ports to be-a ritual feast to feed the spirits-is to recognize that it was a technical activity requiring exacting ritual mastery aimed at achieving concrete results.25 The immediate aim of sacrifice was to venerate the gods, the long-term aim was to nurture them so that the cosmic order would be maintained. While rituals are certainly suffused with symbolic 22 Minister of Rites Xu Jingzong (592-672) presented the original memorial. Tang huiyao, ed. Wang Bo et al.

Sacrifices to Taigong Wang began at the shrine of the Lord of Mili- tary Victory (Wucheng wang) in 731 (Xin Tang shu 15.378) and were terminated in 1388, when they were replaced by sacrifices to Guandi. 25 For critique of scholarship that privileges the symbol as definitive of religious ritual, see Talal Asad, "The Construction of Religion as Anthropological Category," in his Gene- alogies of Religion: Discipline and Reasons of Power in Christianity and Islam (Balti- more: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993), pp. 27-54. 258</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions meanings, semiotic studies that privilege mythical and symbolic func- tions of ritual tend to overlook the instrumental concerns of sacrifice. A PROBLEM OF CANONICAL PRECEDENT The cult of Confucius was not canonical in the strict sense that the clas- sics do not refer to it. The Confucian canon nonetheless proved to be a pliant body of ritual precedents from which ritual scholars drew to legit- imate imperial ceremonies. Key passages in the canon adduced to au- thorize the imperial cult were subject to conflicting readings. Moreover, there was not always broad consensus over which of several liturgical traditions in classical times should serve as the proper precedent, but by the seventh century all key parts of the liturgy were sanctioned by the canon. In fashioning this liturgy in postclassical times, court liturgists were principally concerned with determining where to locate this cult in the ritual hierarchy, and, through a process of ritual analogy, which spirit in the classical pantheon was most like Confucius. To resolve these is- sues was to settle most questions about the details of the sacrifice. In the first several centuries of the emerging imperial cult of Con- fucius successive courts rarely made explicit their rationale for using one ritual precedent over the others. Official chronicles say that imperial sacrifices were first offered to Confucius in 195 B.C.E., when the first em- peror of the Han dynasty traveled to the state of Lu, Confucius's birth- place, and offered a "large beast" (tailao)26 sacrifice of an ox, goat, and pig at a temple located near Confucius's grave. The earliest record of this sacrifice, written a century later, provides no other details of the cere- mony, and it gives no indication that any ancient precedent for the rite was explicitly invoked by the emperor, his ministers, or the court histo- rian who recorded the event. The large beast sacrifice was originally offered at the altars for soils and grains (sheji).27 It is distinguished in the ritual canons from the more exalted "single victim" sacrifice (tesheng) offered at the suburban altars (jiao) of Heaven and Earth. "This is to regard less as more noble," the commentators explain. Thus, "blood is used at the suburban sacrifice [for Heaven and Earth], raw meat [xing] is used in the great offerings [(daxiang) to the royal ancestors], partially cooked meat [yan] is used in the three offerings [(san xian) to soils and grains], and fully cooked meat [shu] is used in the single offering of minor sacrifices. Supreme reverence lies not in the taste of the sacrifice, rather what is revered is 26 Tailao literally refers to the large domesticated animals kept in a pen. 27 The Duke of Zhou was said to have offered three victims to the god of soils (she) after the foundation markings for the new royal city were set.

Kong Anguo, annotated by Kong Yingda (Shisan jing zhushu, 1816), 14.99. 259</page><page sequence="10">Sacrifice and the Imperial Cult of Confucius in the smell of the ethers."28 Several distinctive elements of the sacri- fices at the altars of soils and grains would be redeployed in the liturgy of the Confucius temple even long after this early analogy between the two sacrifices ceased to be pertinent. The large beast sacrifice of three victims, the cult's location between the highest level sacrifices to Heaven and Earth and imperial ancestors, on the one hand, and minor sacrifices, on the other, remained key features throughout the imperial era. The three offerings referred to in the name of the rites at the altar of soils and grains also remained a noteworthy feature of the sacrifices to Confucius.29 There are a few reasons why the gods of soils and grains were re- garded as analogous to Confucius within the logic of sacrifice. Their location in the ritual hierarchy is in itself compelling, for they were below the highest levels occupied by suprahuman gods that rule the cos- mos, such as Heaven and Earth and spirits of once-human men, such as the royal ancestors. Like soils and grains, Confucius was at once local and translocal in that his spirit was eventually venerated at the center in the capital and locally at provincial and county temples. Elevation of the cult of Confucius to great sacrifice would have promoted him beyond the ritual reach of all but the emperor, the only one permitted to offer sacrifices to the gods at the highest level of the hierarchy. The teachings embodied in Confucius as man and spirit that received sacrifices were also simultaneously local and translocal in the sense that they were em- braced by the imperium as the orthodoxy of the empire and were the very foundation and framework of the pedagogies that nurtured and edu- cated all literate men who served the Son of Heaven. As such, like the altars of soils and grains, the temples of Confucius "stood for" the legiti- macy of the state. Another less easily documented reason why the gods of soils and grains constituted valid liturgical analogues for situating the cult of Confucius is that they were regarded, at least by some, as the spirits of once living human beings and thus the logistics of communica- ting the sacrificial offerings through burial of the victim's blood applied equally to the spirit of Confucius.30 The victim offered to the spirit of Confucius was associated with the altar of soils and grains, whereas the music and dance of the liturgy used since the Han were not. According to an early chronicle, an elaborate ceremony called the "music of the six reigns" (liudai zhi yue) accompa- 28 "Jiao tesheng" Liji zhengyi (n. 7 above), 25.216; The Li Ki (n. 7 above), IX.1.2. 29 The three victims were not always cooked in the feast offered to Confucius. Accord- ing to a proclamation in 1371, thenceforth all offerings were to be cooked (shu), suggest- ing that they thereto had had not been cooked (Ming shi 50.1296). 30 The Zhouli also provides for the use of sheji altars and the royal ancestral shrines for sacrifices to rare natural forces and disastrous omens.

The king resided in the Biyong, located at the cen- ter, which in later times was the main building of the Imperial Univer- sity. The heir apparent resided in the second school located in the south of this complex. The music of the six reigns was said to have been used here for sacrifices to Heaven, Earth, the four views (i.e., sun, moon, stars, and seas), mountains and streams, the Zhou dynastic matriarch- Jiang Yuan-and the dynastic founder, Lord Millet. Each piece of music had its own key for instruments based on the pitch of the standard yellow bell and for voice based on the pitch of the seven tube pitch pipe, as well as its own dance.32 There are few references to the music of the six reigns in later dynastic histories, but the main elements of the music that accompanied this ceremony were used as the basis of sacrificial music throughout the imperial era.33 Besides periodic sacrifices to Confucius in Qufu presented by emper- ors or their surrogates, there is little evidence of the formation of an imperial cult of Confucius in the Han.34 Confucius's living descendants were granted a hereditary title in 48 B.C.E., and Confucius received the posthumous title of Exalted Ni Duke of Consummate Perfection (Bao- cheng xuanni gong) in 1 C.E., which suggests that the Han court pro- vided resources to support local cult sacrifice.35 The scope of the cult of Confucius in the Han dynasty was, for the most part, local and limited to his descendants and members of the schools associated with his fol- lowers. Later sources say that sacrifices in Qufu were regularized around 169 C.E. by coordinating them with the calendar of sacrifices to the gods of soils and grains.36 An important link between the cult and peda- gogical institutions in the capital was established soon after the fall of the Han, when, in 241 C.E., a large beast sacrifice was offered to Con- fucius and his chief disciple Yan Hui as correlate in the Imperial Univer- sity (Biyong).37 Although the ceremony was repeated at least ten times 31 The sacrifices were performed in 85 C.E.

Only in retrospect, after the cult was formed, could the accumulation of these institutionally disparate acts be under- stood as a "process"; as a historical evolution guided by the singular pur- pose of institutionalizing sacrifices to Confucius as an imperial cult. Much of the systemization of the sacrifices to Confucius that served to establish an imperial cult took place during the period of disunity called the North-South era (420-588). When, in 445, the Liu-Song court (420- 479) followed the Jin precedent of offering a large beast sacrifice, Pei Songzhi (372-451) recommended modification of the rituals with the use of six rows of dancers (liuyi), three racks of hanging bronze bells and jade chimes (xuanxuan), and sacrificial offerings and ritual vessels ap- propriate for a superior lord (shanggong).38 Pei Songzhi's argument is historically significant for at least two reasons. First, it effectively inte- grated these sacrifices into the imperial pantheon by determining Con- fucius's posthumous rank and matching the level of sacrifice, as marked by the number of ritual dancers, musical instruments, and ritual vessels, with that rank. Although Confucius had been given the rank of duke nearly 450 years earlier, his place in the ritual hierarchy was previously not clear.39 Pei's use of six rows of dancers affirmed a position that Con- fucius himself had taken when he decried the usurpation of the royal court's prerogative of using eight rows at ancestral sacrifices to lessor lords (Analects 3.1). The Rites of Zhou distinguishes among the different number of racks of hanging instruments: royal sacrifices were enclosed by an arrangement called "palace hanging instruments" (gongxuan), which consisted of a rack of bells and chimes on each of four sides, "like the four walls of the palace's interior." The racks of instruments for sacrifices to a lord, called "chariot hanging instruments" (xuanxuan), were arrayed on three sides (like a three-sided chariot), with the south side left open.40 Second, by specifying Confucius's posthumous status as an upper lord, rather than a king, Pei Songzhi made explicit a long-standing tension over Confucius's status in the imperial hierarchy of cults and in the lite- rati tradition. The question of Confucius's posthumous title continued to resurface in debates on the cult for the remainder of the imperial era. It erupted a few decades later at the court of the Southern Qi (479-502), which succeeded the Liu-Song dynasty, and again in the Northern Qi (550-77). Although these courts eventually affirmed Pei's position, other scholars such as Fan Xuan (flourished 480s) maintained that the feudal ranks of the Zhou dynasty did not apply to Confucius, who was neither 38 Nan Qishu, ed.

The dynastic histories compiled before the seventh century refer to imperial rites to Confucius as a large beast sacrifice (tailao) or use the simple verb "to offer sacrifice" (si). The Chronicle of the Three Kingdoms, compiled in 297 C.E., calls rites during the Wei and Jin large beast sacrifices. In his history of the Jin dynasty, completed three and a half centuries later, however, Fang Xuanling (579-648) alters the description of the same ceremonies by saying that "libations [shidian] were offered with a large beast sacrifice," thereby inserting the term that would be used to refer to sacrifices to Confucius almost exclusively ever since.45 The locus classicus of "libation" is the "When King Wen was Heir Apparent" chapter of the Record of Rites, which says, "In all schools, the officers in spring present libation to the late masters. This was also done in the autumn and winter. Whenever a school was estab- lished, offerings were always presented to the former sages and masters. Silk was used when performing these rites. There was [music] accompa- niment with the presentation of offerings, except when there were press- ing matters of state."46 41 Nan Qishu 9.143-44. 42 Tang huiyao (n. 22 above), 35.745; Jiu Tangshu 24.920-21. 43 Ming shi (n. 16 above), 25.1284; Ming tongjian, ed.

Indeed, referring to sacrifices per- formed four hundred years earlier with words that were not used at the time changed nothing in the fleeting moments of the sacrifices performed in the Jin. The effect of grafting libations onto the large beast sacrifice, however, was historically more permanent. The temple established by the Tang court had venerated the Duke of Zhou as the sage and Con- fucius as his correlate.47 Fang Xuanling, historian of the Jin, was also vice director of the Left and at the forefront of efforts to establish Con- fucius as the sage of the temple cult in which the latter's disciples and twenty-two exegetical masters of the canonical books were also vener- ated. "We ministers call both the Duke of Zhou and Confucius sages," Fang Xuanling and others argued in 629, except that "the offerings at schools [xiangxu] were originally based on Confucius," literally the Mas- ter (fuzi). "This has been the practice for many successive generations," they continued, "and has been accepted by the ancients." The court agreed, ceased sacrifices to the Duke of Zhou, and promoted Confucius to First Sage of the temple.48 Fang Xuanling's history of the Jin effectively inserted into the chroni- cles the precedent of the libation that provided his case for Confucius's status as sage and priority in temple sacrifices over the Duke of Zhou with a longer history. Without making any changes in the actual liturgy, Fang Xuanling's "superscribing" of the libation offering to the canonical masters of the exegetical schools onto a sacrifice originally offered to the gods of soils and grains shifted the ritual location of the precedents invoked to authorize the Tang sacrifices in what we may now call a "Confucius" temple.49 What was once a rite grounded in royal sacrifices performed by kings and their regents, archetypically by the Duke of 47 The Duke of Zhou loyally served his younger brother, the first king of the Zhou dy- nasty, and was venerated as a paragon of ministral loyalty. As a member of the royal fam- ily, his status in the Confucian tradition was suspect in the Tang, when scholar-officials sought to distinguish themselves from the imperial house. David McMullen, State and Scholar in Tang China (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 33. 48 Xin Tang shu (n. 18 above), 13.373; Tang huiyao 35.742. A memorial dated 647 pre- sented by Xu Jingzong also cited "When King Wen Was Heir Apparent" to designate the appropriate persons to perform certain parts of the sacrifices. Interestingly, Xu assigns the ritual garb worn during the sacrifices on the basis of the soils and grains liturgy (Tang huiyao 35.748). 49 The sources refer to this temple as the Master's temple (fuzi miao). The original text of the school libation does not specify who are the masters and sages intended to receive the offering. Zheng Xuan's commentary identifies the masters as officers who taught the Rites, Music, Odes, and Documents. Zheng cites two examples of sages: the Duke of Zhou and Confucius.

To dismiss Fang's use of the chronicles to legitimate his position on the origin of this sacrifice as a willful manip- ulation of history oversimplifies the ways that historians construct the past that they record. He presupposed that any "large beast" sacrifice offered to Confucius was perforce a "libation" ceremony, which origi- nated in schools and thus "restored" the words that he believed belonged in the official account of the rite. Regardless of Fang Xuangling's motives, the momentous effect of this seemingly innocuous interpolation should not be underestimated. It estab- lished an inextricable association between this imperial cult and Confu- cius as its sage. The forging of this association entailed the removal of the Duke of Zhou from the cult and the resituating of the Duke of Zhou within the Confucian tradition more specifically as loyal minister and less as producer of textual and doctrinal traditions. After the Duke of Zhou's brief return to the Confucius temple in the 650s, opponents again invoked the passage in the Record of Rites to establish a close link among schools-as places of canonical instruction-the shidian libation, and Confucius as the first sage of the tradition.50 The Duke of Zhou was again removed from this temple, never to return, and ceased to be the archetypal paragon of the canonical traditions taught in schools. He, of course, continued to be a paragon of a different sort-as the archetypal loyal minister-and thereafter received sacrifices as a correlate in the temple of the Zhou founders.51 Although the Duke's removal effectively demoted him, it more importantly effected greater precision within the imperial pantheon; an ongoing project that continued throughout the Tang. The invocation of the Record of Rites as the principal antecedent of the sacrifices to Confucius in the 650s was thereafter routinized and unchallenged. The cult practices of the temple that would be tied to Confucius rather than the Duke of Zhou in Tang times had, in fact, already been more closely associated with the former. As early as 72 C.E., the sacrifices to Confucius in Queli were also offered to his disciples.52 As noted, in the years before the construction of an imperial temple in the capital, succes- sive courts offered sacrifices to Confucius and Yan Hui at the Imperial University. Soon after the Duke of Zhou was removed from the temple in 647, twenty-two exegetical masters of the canon also received tertiary sacrifices in the imperial temple.53 By the eighth century, Confucius was given the title of Exalted King of Culture and ten of his disciples were 50 Tang huiyao 35.743. 51 Xin Tang shu 15.374. 52 Hou Hanshu (n. 31 above), 2.118-19. 53 Jiu Tangshu (n. 42 above), 3.59. 265</page><page sequence="16">Sacrifice and the Imperial Cult of Confucius elevated to the status of savant (zhe), a new position without parallel in the other cults.54 We have seen that due to the absence of canonical precedent, court rit- ualists of the imperial era had to locate the cult of Confucius in the pantheon by ritual analogy. Even though this cult was situated among the middle-level sacrifices early on, important disagreements over many of the details of the cult liturgy persisted throughout this period. Con- fucius's competition with the Duke of Zhou for the status of sage of the literati cult in the seventh century demonstrates the problems involved in forming the rites. The conflict that led eventually to the Duke of Zhou's removal was part of a larger social shift taking place in the Tang that saw the emergence of a literati class whose access to status was not as de- pendent upon aristocratic pedigrees as scholars in earlier times.55 Later, from the eleventh century to the end of the imperial era in 1911, the temple as a space for the enshrinement of later Confucian scholars be- came particularly contested. One reason for this is the rising importance of civil examinations as the primary vehicle for recruitment into the civil bureaucracy. The question of which version of the canonical books was accepted as the textual foundation of imperial orthodoxy was critical in determining the norms that would guide the imperium.56 THE IMPERIAL CULT OF CONFUCIUS The sacrifice to Confucius was a cult for the classically educated. In late imperial times, only degree holders, examination students, and other promising young men were permitted entry into the temple during the ceremony.57 The first emperor of the Ming dynasty rejected a peti- tion to allow talented commoners to perform as musicians and dancers in the ceremony, saying, "Music and dance are scholars' concerns, let alone the libation, which is the way to honor the Master."58 Phrases from the canon-words of and for the classically literate-appeared everywhere throughout the temple grounds, in marked contrast to more exalted ritual spaces devoted to the veneration of Heaven and Earth, where there were few such literary inscriptions except for names on buildings, altars, and spirit tablets. In the Confucius temple lengthy stele inscriptions and 54 Ibid. 24.919; Xin Tang shu 15.375-76. 55 McMullen, pp. 5-13. 56 Thomas A. Wilson, Genealogy of the Way: The Construction and Uses of the Confu- cian Tradition in Late Imperial China (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1995), chap. 1. 57 Thus its fate would be inextricably tied to the power and status of the Confucian literati. Sacrifices continued-or faltered-in the early years of the Republic when Con- fucian education ceased to be tied to the state. 58 Ming shi (n. 16 above), 50.1296. 266</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions elliptical phrases from the classics on wooden tablets adorned gates, pillars, archways, building edifices, the ceiling inside the main hall, and the niche that housed Confucius's spirit tablet. The tablets proclaimed Confucius the "Paragon and Master of the Ten Thousand Generations" (wanshi shibiao),59 "Unprecedented since the Birth of the People" (sheng- min wei you),60 and "Equal to Heaven and Earth" (yu tiandi can).61 Other tablets announced that he was the "Great Consummation of the Sages' Cumulative Virtues" (shengji da cheng)62 and the "Perennial Transfor- mation" (huacheng you jiu)63 that enabled all things to realize their natures. 59 This phrase is of uncertain provenance. The exact wording may have been recent when the Kangxi emperor wrote the calligraphy for the tablet in 1683. Qing shi gao (n. 16 above), 84.2534. Sacrificial hymns refer to Confucius as the "teacher of the ten thousand generations" (wanshi zhi shi) as early as the Song. See Song shi (n. 18 above), 137.3236; Yuan shi, ed. Song Lian (1370; reprint, Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1976), 69.1739; Qing shi gao 96.2825. A similar phrase was used in 1369 in response to Ming Taizu's (r. 1368- 1402) suspension of sacrifices to Confucius, when Vice Minister Cheng Xu compared Confucius's contribution to human culture with those of the gods of soils and grains and the ancient sage-kings by saying, "Illuminating the Way of the three bonds and the five constants, recording them in the canon, establishing the model for the hundred kings and becoming the paragon for the ten-thousand generations, which ensured the subjugation of the world and enabled the people to never falter, this is the power of Confucius" (Ming shi 139.3981-82). 60 This is an elliptical rendering of Mengzi 2A.2, which reads, "Since the birth of people, there has been no one such as Confucius" (zi you shengmin yilai weiyou Kongzi). For uses of the expression in the Tang, see McMullen (n. 47 above), p. 274, n. 30. 61 Allusion to the "Doctrine of the Mean" chapter of the Record of Rites, which says only the sage who is supremely sincere or authentic is able to plumb the depths of his own nature and the natures of all things. The sage is thus able to assist Heaven and Earth in the transformation and nourishing of things and thereby become equal to Heaven and Earth ("Zhong yong," Liji zhengyi [n. 7 above], 53.44; The Li Ki [n. 7 above], XXVIII.2.22; and "Li yun" Liji zhengyi 22.194). Zhou Dunyi (1017-73) later describes Confucius in these terms. Tongshu in Zhou Lianxi ji (1708), ed. Zhang Boxing (Congshu jicheng; reprint, Shanghai: Shangwu, 1936), 6.127. References to Confucius as equal to Heaven and Earth probably coincide with the increasing importance of the Four Books in the late Song; such wording made its way into the temple vocabulary as early as 1310, when Yuan Wu- zong (r. 1301-11) used slightly different wording: yu tian di bing. Queli wenxian kao, ed. Kong Jifen (1762; reprint, Taipei: Zhongguo wenxian chubanshe, 1966), 33.21a. In an edict dated 1132 appointing a descendant of Confucius to a post, Song Gaozong (r. 1127- 62) says that the "Master's Dao was equal to Heaven and Earth" (Queli zhi [n. 36 above], 7.20b). The Yongle (r. 1403-24) emperor also had words to the same effect: Kongzi can tian di (ibid. 33.28a). 62 Allusion to Mencius 5B.1, which compares Confucius's virtues with those of earlier sages. Mencius said Confucius completed the cumulative virtues of the other sages like bells are used to begin the music and jade chimes are used to conclude it. In other words, Confucius consummates the work of other sages by attending to all matters from beginning to end. 63 An allusion to the "Duration" (heng) hexagram of the Book of Change, where it says, "The sun and moon reach the heavens and can shine forever, the four seasons change and transform and eternally realize completion, the sage perennially rests in his Dao and all un- der Heaven is transformed." Wang Bi's commentary explains that "the sage obtains his eternal Dao by responding to the changes, and is thereby able to remain brilliant through- out the empire and enable the myriad things to transform and realize their nature" (Zhouyi zhengyi [n. 8 above], 4.35). 267</page><page sequence="18">Sacrifice and the Imperial Cult of Confucius Reiterating Confucius's own declamation, another reads, "This Culture Lies in Me" (siwen zai ci).64 The circle of cult and celebrant was closed and complete: only the li- terati were capable of reading the refined words of the canon found throughout the temple grounds and only they and the emperor were per- mitted entry into the temple cult that paid homage to him in whom Heaven had invested this Culture. Herein lies the crux of this cult's com- plex relationship with the imperial pantheon as a whole. The principal figure of the temple was called a sage, although his posthumous status never rose higher than king, thus he never occupied the pinnacle of the ritual hierarchy. According to the principles of that hierarchy, such a promotion would have rendered the cult inaccessible to the literati, thus it would not make sense to elevate him higher. In spite of this middle position, the power and prestige of the Confucian literati were invested in the cult, and the cult exalted the literati by establishing their role through the spirit of Confucius in the pantheon and the cosmic order. Confucius was, for a time, granted special dispensation in the first cen- tury and a half of Ming rule when only his posthumous noble title of king was retained while those of all other deities of the pantheon were re- moved in 1370.65 Even the liturgies that reverenced him as king fre- quently belied greater veneration than was suggested in a title that placed him in the middle. Ritual mastery. Although the cult of Confucius is not found in the ritual canons of the classical era, the ceremony was not invented from whole cloth. Beginning in early imperial times, it was fashioned from liturgical elements used in sacrifices to other analogous spirits found in the classics. Court debates on the rites often centered upon questions of what posthumous noble title should be conferred upon Confucius, what costume his image should wear, and which ceremony (namely, the num- ber of rows of dancers and hanging bells and chimes, or the type of mu- sic and dance to be performed) was most appropriate for his rank. Many details of the liturgy were fixed as early as the Tang when this cult was located in the hierarchy of great, middle, and minor sacrifices described above. By ranking this as a middle-level sacrifice, the court, at least in principle, resolved most of the remaining questions about the liturgy. The neat symmetry of the Tang code was temporary, however, as con- troversies brought about by calls to further exalt Confucius continued throughout the late imperial era. As a consequence, his posthumous title, 64 Allusion to Analects 9.5 in which Confucius says that Heaven invested its charge in him, thereby implicitly recognizing his own sagehood. 65 Ming shi 25.1284. 268</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions garb, liturgy, and offerings were frequently at odds with those of other middle level cults.66 A ritual officer in late imperial times was expected to master both the ancient ritual canons and the liturgy promulgated by the court. Detailed outlines of the approved liturgy were contained in ritual manuals pub- lished by the Ministry of Rites. These were not exhaustive descriptions, however, and many parts of the rites were simply referred to by the terms used and explicated in the ritual canons. The later sources presumed prior knowledge of the classics. For a number of reasons mastery of the rites did not necessarily depend upon full awareness of the canonical al- lusions in the ritual manuals. A sacrificer may also have had in mind other competing passages in classical texts when performing the rites. Ritual mastery was also gained in other venues, through numerous prac- tical situations encountered from youth, which accounts for why expla- nations of certain aspects of imperial sacrifice were not always necessary. Imperial rites shared certain key elements with other unofficial sacrifices, such as ancestor worship. Thus, even before entering an imperial shrine, ritual officers had already learned basic ritual gestures, the proper han- dling of sacrificial vessels, the correct attitude one bears in mind toward the spirit that is to receive the sacrifice, and the like. The pervasiveness of ritual sacrifice in the practices of people at all levels of late imperial society virtually ensured that consecration officers in the Confucius temple would have a thorough command of most of the elements of the rites.67 Virtually every degree holder in the empire was familiar with sacrifices to Confucius in particular because they would have partici- pated in this ceremony at local schools from the early years of their for- mal education. This is perhaps the only sacrifice that they would have participated in more than once and perhaps many times, even if they never received bureaucratic appointment. Preparing for, participating in, and offering sacrifices to the gods and spirits of the imperial pantheon was an integral and important part of being an official.68 There were, 66 I discuss the contestation over the meaning of the cult in Genealogy of the Way, chap. 1, and in "Ritualizing Confucius," in On Sacred Grounds: Culture, Society, Politics, and the Formation of the Cult of Confucius, ed. Thomas A. Wilson (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University, in press). 67 For a theoretical consideration of the nontextual transmission of mastery of cultural practices, see Pierre Bourdieu, Outline of a Theory of Practice (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), see esp. pp. 78-95. 68 Local Ming officials offered sacrifice to the gods of soils and grains, wind and clouds, thunder and rain, mountains and streams, the souls of wandering ghosts, Confucius, Tai- gong Wang, city gods, gods of flags and banners, and emperors and kings whose tombs lay within their districts (Ming shi 47.1226). Each god received sacrifice twice or four times a year. Considering that each ceremony lasted two or three days from fast to completion, a magistrate was expected to devote more than sixty days a year to these rites. 269</page><page sequence="20">Sacrifice and the Imperial Cult of Confucius moreover, ceremonial masters (dianyi), chief liturgists (tongzan or zanli), and invocators (yinzan) assigned to official temples who instructed rit- ual participants during rehearsals and announced instructions throughout the ceremony, correcting and assisting the ritual officers (xianguan or dian'guan) at each step. As with other imperial rites, the sacrifice to Confucius comprised three main elements of an offering of silk, feast, and libation; music, including hymns and the number and configuration of instruments; and dance, specified in number of rows of dancers. Although details often vary, the ceremonies of imperial sacrifice can be outlined in the following way:69 A preparatory fast begins two or three days before the rite, then, in the first two hours after midnight on the morning of the ceremony, the ritual instructors, officers, and assistants arrange the vessels and offerings in front of the altar. Drums are sounded,70 the gates opened, and the blood and fur of the victims buried outside the main gate.71 The musicians, dancers, and consecration officers then assume their assigned positions in the temple grounds. Music is played, the novices dance on the front plat- form, and hymns are chanted72 while the spirit is escorted into the temple (yingshen). The consecration officer, who is situated at the bottom of the stairs leading to the main hall, moves in front of the altar, performs a sequence of a bow, prostration, rising, prostration, rising, stands erect to present silk, incense, and libation, then resumes his position at the foot of the stairs. A prayer (zhu) is then sung, and the silk, libation, and prayer 69 This schematic account is based on the following sources: Da Mingjili, ed.

The way and virtue are re- vered. Nurture the royal transformation, this people, this ancestral hall. The liturgy and sacrifices are constant, their refinement and purity ascend ever higher. The spirits come in good order now, and in the light is reflected the sage's presence!"

Offerings to correlates, savants, worthies, and scholars are presented by secondary consecration officers immediately after the principal offering is tendered. The consecration officer returns to the altar to repeat his libation offering, which invites the spirit to partake in the entire feast, in a second and final offering, for a total of three times (sanxian). The consecration officer drinks some of the blessed wine and receives a portion of the sacrificial meat. The assisting consecration officials proceed to the altars in front of each of the spirit tablets to move the sacrificial vessels slightly, indicating completion of the ceremony. The spirit is bidden farewell (songshen), all process out of the temple through the main gate following behind the spirit, and the prayer and silk (the only two things that are sacrificed by fire) are burned in an oven out- side the inner gate. In the two sections that follow, I focus on two key questions: the aims of the fast and the status of the victim. As in the previous section, I draw from classical sources to explicate the imperial Chinese sacrifice. I also draw comparisons with Vedic sacrifice in order to challenge ideas of sacrifice articulated by Hubert and Mauss, and to confront our own pre- conceptions about the nature of sacrifice. Purity without expiation. Three days before the sacrifices to Con- fucius, celebrants prepared for the rite beginning with a bath and change of clothes. In classical times this was done whenever the lord entered the temple to sacrifice or was about to engage in matters that required reverence.73 Thus reverence characterized more than an inner state of purity-although it was at least this-but was corporeally enacted with cleansed skin and worn on the body with proper garb. Only the act of cleansing could adequately prepare one to sacrifice to the gods. Mencius said, "Passers by could not but hold their noses were the handsome Xi Shi to wear filthy head gear, whereas even a wretched man could sacri- fice to the Lord on High if he fasted and bathed."74 The act of bathing at an initial phase of sacrifice is widespread, if not universal, but what is cleansed and the ritual body that is produced by the bath is not always the same. According to the Satapatha-Brahmana, the Vedic priest removes impurities by shaving and cutting his nails.75 "He bathes," says the text. "For impure, indeed, is man: he thinks: 'May I be 73 "Yuzao" Liji zhengyi (n. 7 above), 29.247; "Gu ming" Shangshu zhengyi (n. 27 above), 18.126. 74 Mengzi zhengyi, ed.

This is the brahmana of the Yajur-Veda, which prescribes ritual actions performed by the execu- tive adhvaryu priests. 271</page><page sequence="22">Sacrifice and the Imperial Cult of Confucius consecrated, after becoming pure."'76 Purity in Vedic sacrifice "destroys" what is foul and untrue; but more, it consecrates (diksha) the sacrificer. "He who is consecrated," says the text, "elevates himself [ud-grabh] from this world to the world of the gods."77 The Vedic and Confucian sacrificers both require purification before the rite, but because they play fundamentally different intermediary roles, the nature of purity differs in important ways: the Confucian sacrificer's cleanliness expresses the rev- erence that makes him presentable before the gods while he is never any- thing but human, whereas the Vedic priest is ritually separated from and elevated above the profane world. Upon completing the sacrifice, the Vedic priest divests himself of his elevated state and returns "into im- purity" and "now again becomes man."78 Having bathed and donned proper clothing, the Confucian ritual offi- cers observed a two-day "working abstinence" (sanzhai) aimed at achiev- ing a state of inner piety and outer reverence. The efficacy of the process of abstinence (also translated as fast) that can produce a disciplined sacrificer hinges on a conception of the self that refuses to prioritize an internal self as more genuine than external skin and clothes: both are equally essential to the efficacy of the rite.79 According to the regulations promulgated by imperial courts, one carried out routine duties of one's office during the period of working abstinence while certain kinds of official duties, such as consoling the bereaved, inquiring of the ill, pass- ing judgment on or carrying out a sentence of a convict were proscribed. Other kinds of activities, such as drinking wine, eating meat,80 contact with wives and listening to music, were also to be avoided.81 Exploiting the multiple meanings of the character that means both "to fast" (when it is pronounced zhai) and "to order" (pronounced qi), the Record of Rites explains: "To fast is a way of saying 'to bring unified or- der to.' To fast that which is not ordered is to impose order on it." To fast means to abstain from those activities that divide one's concentration when confronted with important matters. Thus the Record of Rites ex- 76 Satapatha-Brdhmana III.1.2.10. See also Taittiriya Samhita, The Veda of the Black Yajus School Entitled Taittiriaya Sanhita, trans. Arthur B.

When fasting, one resists depraved things [xiewu] and prohibits desires [shiyu]; the ears do not listen to music."82 Not all of the activities from which the sacrificer abstains while con- centrating on the imminent ceremony are in themselves depraved and not all of the desires that one refuses to satisfy are inherently evil. The particular depraved acts and objects of desire are not enumerated in the classics and not explained in the commentaries,83 or even in dynastic treatises on sacrifice.84 It would appear that the ritual canons proscribe participation in depraved or despicable acts only during the period of abstinence and ceremony, and that succumbing to such unmention- able things while not fasting did not so defile the sacrificer that he would never be able to offer sacrifices again without expiation.85 Indeed, the cleansing achieved through the fast is not construed as purging the sacrificer of any cumulative effect of previous defilement in order to sac- rifice. These preparatory abstinences bring order to and unify the body (literally, "hands and feet") and mind of the sacrificer. "Thus the ancient record says, 'He who fasts does not [hear] music,' which means one dares not let the will wander. The mind that does not wander improperly will necessarily follow the Dao, the hands and feet that do not move improp- erly will necessarily follow the rite. For this reason the ruler-nobleman's [junzi ] fast exclusively applies the power of his undivided concentration [zhuanzhi qi jingming zhi de]."86 The ordering of the sacrificer's hands and feet underscores the technical aims of sacrifice; it is not merely ex- pressive or symbolic action. The ceremony does not simply express the idea of reverence toward the gods and spirits, nor does it just symbolize the idea of respect toward one's elders. More hangs in the balance when 82 "Ji tong;' Liji zhengyi 49.375; The Li Ki XXII.6. 83 One standard commentary simply elaborates upon the original wording thus, "The text says that before fasting the mind wanders and falls into what it desires. That which is not ordered is rectified once it is fasted and realizes the way of supreme abstinence" ("Ji tong," Liji zhengyi 49.375). 84 Some of the dynastic treaties in the Tang through Yuan speak of abstaining from par- ticipation in despicable (huiwu) or defiling (huie) acts, which had a decidedly Buddhist ring. Jiu Tang shu (n. 33 above), 21.819; Jin shu (n. 37 above), 11.312; Yuan shi 73.1814. The dynastic treatises of the Song, Ming, and Qing do not mention "despicable acts." 85 Von Staden argues that purity in ancient Greece was a state of being uncontaminated through a temporary avoidance of sources of contamination, which were otherwise natu- rally occurring and unavoidable. This was a necessary but not sufficient state in which to approach the gods, he continues, for one needed to do so in a holy way that was right and appropriate in relation to the gods.

They are sustained through sacrifice and, in exchange, they nurture the cosmos. Attainment of this state of mental and corporeal concentration is achieved gradually in stages. The period of preparatory fasting is broken into two phases that intensify the fast to deepen one's "bodily commit- ment" and sharpen the focus of one's concentration.87 After the period of the working abstinence, the sacrificer leaves home to reside at the temple where he observes one day of the "strict fast" (zhizhai) and attends to preparations for the sacrifice exclusively. The aim of the preceding work- ing abstinence is to "fix" or to "settle" (ding) the mind and body of the sacrificer. The aim of the strict fast is to "unify" body and mind. The Record of Rites explains that "what is ordered is the perfect realization of undivided concentration. Only then is it possible to commune with the gods and spirits" (ranhou keyi jiao yu shenming ye).88 Another chapter of the Record of Rites describes the king's sacrifices to the royal ancestors. The text says that the king was cloistered during the strict fast when he "recalled the place where he [i.e., his ancestor] re- sided, his amusements and resolutions, what he took delight in and his special loves." While the circumstances of ancestral sacrifice do not apply to the sacrifices made to most other deities of the imperial pan- theon-particularly those that are not spirits of once mortal men-the king's efforts to visualize the person who was about to receive sacrifices as though he were still alive affected a mental, corporeal purity of the self that applied to all sacrifices. One's person became a vessel of mem- ories that rendered the sacrificer an efficacious medium to serve the spirit.89 Communion between the living and the spirits depended upon the unified state of single-minded concentration achieved by the fasting sacrificer. Thus, "when one enters the hall on the day of the sacrifice," the Record of Rites says, "one almost certainly seems to see him at his tablet.... One almost certainly hears the sound of his sigh. For this rea- son, the filiality of the former kings was such that the sight [of the an- cestors] was never absent from their eyes and the sound [of their voices] never ceased in their ears."90 The ritual treatise in the Ming History de- scribes the purpose of the fast equally vividly: "To concentrate and unify 87 The phrase "bodily commitment" is Tom Driver's in The Magic of Ritual: Our Need for Liberating Rites That Transform Our Lives and Our Communities (San Francisco: Harper, 1991), p. 84. 88 "Ji tong" Liji zhengyi 49.375; The Li Ki XXII.6. 89 For analysis of the uses of the image in ancestor worship and sacrifices to Confucius, see Deborah Sommer, "Destroying Confucius: Iconoclasm in the Confucian Temple" in Wilson, ed.

It demonstrates that the conception of the nature and circumstances of sacrifice articulated in the ritual canons continued to influence how sacrifice was understood in the late imperial era. It also serves as an interesting commentary on the ambiguous passage in the Analects (3.12), "To sacrifice like the spirit is present." This prescription is sometimes misconstrued by modem readers to mean that Confucius believed that the spirits were not "really" present at sacrifice because they were simply dead.92 The Ming ritual treatise, however, paraphrases the wording in the Analects to make a different point: the spirits are not visible, but one can see them as if they were still alive only by undergoing the fast with "complete sincerity." Finally, although the text of the Record of Rites is largely devoted to the ancient kings' sacrifices to Heaven and their ancestors, the passage in the Ming ritual treatise serves as a general principle of sacrifice. The aims of the fast expressed here were to apply to the sacrificer's mental, corporeal ordering in preparation for sacrifice to all of the gods and spirits. The sacrificer, through his abiding concentration on the spirit, his solemn rev- erence and complete sincerity, is drawn toward the spirit without becom- ing one with it. Hubert and Mauss argue that purification rites constitute an essential component of sacrifice because all key elements of the ceremony are pro- fane and have yet to enter the sacred. The sacrifier, sacrificer, place of ceremony, instruments, and victim lack the sacred characteristics neces- sary to be presented to the gods. The distinction between sacrifier-the person, group, or community that receives the benefit of the ceremony- and sacrificer-the priest who performs the rite-does not translate neatly into imperial Chinese sacrifice. The Chinese sacrificer is not a member of a priestly order whose ordination entails prior or lasting con- secration described by Hubert and Mauss.93 While the Chinese emperor embodies the community that benefits from his sacrifice to Heaven and 91 Ming shi (n. 16 above), 47.1239-40. This passage is attributed to Academician Zhu Sheng (1299-1371) in a conversation with the emperor in 1369. 92 Fung Yu-lan argues that Confucian sacrifice to the spirits of the dead involved a will- ful self-deception to satisfy emotional needs. "The Confucianist Theory of Mourning, Sacrificial and Wedding Rites," Chinese Social and Political Science Review 15, no. 3 (1931): 335-45. Fung's view of sacrifice as a means of allaying grief resonates with Xun- zi's recognition that the gentleman regards sacrifice as the way of man, whereas com- mon folk believe it is the service of ghosts (Xunzi jijie [n. 4 above], 13.250). 93 Hubert and Mauss (n. 2 above), pp. 22-23. 275</page><page sequence="26">Sacrifice and the Imperial Cult of Confucius Earth and a ritual officer of the court represents those segments of the populace that benefit from sacrifice to Confucius, the functional distinc- tion between sacrifier and sacrificer is either collapsed or replicated. The state of ritual purity realized by Vedic and Confucian sacrificers differ in important ways. In preparing for the sacrifice, the Vedic priest is stripped of "his temporal being that he possessed, in order to cause him to be reborn in an entirely new form. All that touches upon the gods must be divine; the sacrifier is obliged to become a god himself in order to be capable of acting upon them."94 The efficacy of the Vedic sacrifice requires human transformation into something close to the gods, only then will the sacrificer attain a level of holy purity through self-consecration requisite for actual contact with the gods. Purity in the Vedic rite is achieved through expulsion of inner impurities, expiation, and transformation. The Record of Rites is also concerned with purity and explicitly states that it is necessary in order to commune with the gods and spirits. The purity attained during the phases of working and strict fast described above is realized through increase; though the sacrificer's enlarged con- sciousness of the spirit that is to receive the sacrifice and his ability to bring the will, hands, and feet to singular order. Purity in Chinese sac- rifice is a state of complete devotion to the spirit realized by abstaining from those responsibilities and defiling things that will distract the sacrificer from concentrating on the imminent sacrifice and prevent him from seeing the hidden spirit at the altar. Early liturgical texts of many traditions rarely expound upon the sac- rificer's mental state with much precision. The Chinese ritual canons make clear that the urge to sacrifice comes from within the heart of the filial and the pious. The Record of Rites says, "Sacrifice is not some- thing that comes from the outside. It originates from within and is ex- pressed through the heart. The heart trembles [chu] and is expressed in sacrifice. For this reason only the pious are able to realize the aim of sacrifice."95 Although it speaks of the piety of the heart, the emphasis in the Record of Rites is on the sacrificer's demonstration of inner piety by means of ritual action. Sacrifice constitutes a continuum beginning from the pious heart to the completion of the offering. The reparation offering of ancient Hebrew ritual (Lev. 5:14-26), sometimes referred to as the "guilt offering," is striking for the absence of description of the inner dis- 94 Ibid., pp. 19-20; Satapatha-Brahmana (n. 71 above), I.1.1, 6. 95 "Ji tong" Liji zhengyi 49.374; The Lt Ki XXII.1. Kleeman ([n. 4 above], pp. 199- 200) places this passage and the issue of ritual purity in the context of tightening restric- tions on access to the power of the gods in the Han's enlarged sense of the "gods as fulfilling some greater moral purpose." 276</page><page sequence="27">History of Religions position of contrition of the one who transgressed, even though the point of this rite is expiation. Jacob Milgrom notes the absence of metaphors to describe inner feelings of guilt in this book of the Bible, although feel- ings of guilt are described in other, later books of the Old Testament and in later Mishnaic commentaries. Even in these passages, though, guilt is alluded to through reference to "the suffering brought on by guilt, ex- pressed now by words such as qualms, pangs, remorse, and contrition."96 In one instance of a "failed" sacrifice in the Bible (Lev. 10:1-3) due to what were possibly impure internal motives, Nadaba and Abihu, Aaron's eldest sons, offered "strange" or unholy fire (i.e., not from the perpetu- ally burning fire) to the Lord (Lev. 6:13): "And fire came forth from the Lord and consumed them." Although we may infer Nadaba's and Abihu's improper inner motives and dispositions, the text speaks of it solely on the basis of externally observable and physically demonstrable improper actions. The internal is entailed in an external state. A feast of aromas. In the early hours on the morning of the sacrifice the feast of imperial sacrifice was placed on an offering table (zhuan- zhuo) in front of the altar. Liturgical texts usually list the sacrificial foods in measurements of several types of vessel (biandou) used in the ban- quets for guests' rituals as well as ritual feasting of the auspicious rites. The goblet (jue) was a tripod for the libation of the type commonly found in archaeological excavations; three were offered in all great and middle sacrifices. There were three kinds of pots of soup: a covered pot (deng) of unsalted beef broth (taigeng or dageng) and two tureens (xing) of mixed beef and salted pork soup (hegeng). Covered baskets (bian) and bowls (dou) were used for nuts, grasses, and condiments, said, in the ritual canons, to contain products of the water and earth.97 Baskets, constructed of weaved bamboo, contained dry foods: a sculpted block of salt, dried fish, dates, chestnuts, hazelnuts, water caltrops, chicken- head water lily, dried venison, "white," made as wheat-honey cakes in imperial times, and "black," made as buckwheat-honey black cakes.98 Bowls contained minced condiments and sauces: pickled leeks, rape tur- nip, and celery grass, minced venison, rabbit, and fish, bamboo shoots, sweet breads, and pork blades.99 There were two kinds of jars for raw 96 Jacob Milgrom, trans., The Anchor Bible, vol. 3, Leviticus 1-16: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (New York: Doubleday, 1991), p. 343. 97 "Jiao tesheng" Liji zhengyi (n. 7 above), 25.226; The Li Ki (n. 7 above), IX.2.17-18. 98 The canonical source for these foods is the Rites of Zhou, which lists them as under the charge of the palace basket handler ("Tian guan," Zhouli zhushu [n. 8 above], 5.33- 34). Michael Nylan has pointed out to me that these were foods eaten in the royal palace and that there is no implication in the text that they were prescribed for sacrifice. 99 These foods were the charge of the palace condiments chef ("Tian guan" Zhouli zhushu 6.36-37). 277</page><page sequence="28">Sacrifice and the Imperial Cult of Confucius grains: a carved square container (fu) for glutinous and plain millet (shuji) and carved round container (gui) for raw rice stalk and sorghum. Finally, a square tray (fei) was used for white silk damask.l00 The aim of the sacrificial feast is not that it should taste good. The spirits are satiated not by the flavor of what is eaten but the aroma of the feast. They are like the living insofar as they require food for suste- nance, but unlike mortals in that they are ethereal, not physical, and thus what is pleasing and usable for the living may be irrelevant to the spirits. "Utmost reverence lies not in the flavor of the sacrifice," the Record of Rites says, "What is revered is the smell of the ethers."'0l The Rites con- sistently confounds conventional human expectations of gratification in ritual placation of gods and spirits: "The offerings of the former kings are edible, not pleasurable to eat. Robes, cap, and carriage can be arrayed but they are not comfortable. Martial dances display strength but are not enjoyable. Ancestral shrines are awesome, not comfortable places to live. The ritual vessels of the ancestral shrine are functional but not convenient to use. That which communicates with the spirits can not be the same as what is comfortable or enjoyable [for the living]."102 The im- plication that the desire for comfort and pleasure was distinctively hu- man and decidedly not spiritual can be seen in the repeated preference in the Record of Rites for simplicity and what is basic: "Sweet wine is de- licious, yet dark wines and brilliant waters are superior because they respect the basics of the five flavors. The embroidery of the garment's in- signias are beautiful, but plainness is exalted and returns to the origins of women's work [i.e., weaving].

After the gods were created by Prajapati ("lord of creatures"), the Satapatha-Brahmana says, they "went on offering unto one another. Pragapati gave himself up to them, and the sacrifice became theirs; for, indeed, the sacrifice is the food of the gods. Having given himself up to the gods, he created that counterpart of himself, to wit, the sacrifice: whence people say, 'The sacrifice is Pragapati'; for he created it as a counterpart of himself."106 The Rg-Veda describes the self-sacrifice of Purusa, the primeval man whose body is divided in sacrifice to create gods and other things of the world.107 The victim becomes a symbolic substitute for the man who offers it as a sacrifice and man, being closer to the gods in relative "excellence"-as determined by a spirit hierarchy of qualities-repre- sents or stands for the god.108 The Satapatha-Brahmana says, "Now the sacrifice is the man. The sacrifice is the man for the reason that the man spreads (performs) it; and that in being spread it is made of exactly the same as the man; this is the reason why the sacrifice is the man."109 Thus the sacrificers and other participants imbibe parts or qualities of the whole consecrated victim, which itself stands for man and god, when they consume it in a feast that completes the sacrifice. While the victims of the large beast sacrifice to Confucius are also central in these ceremonies, the event of their slaughter is not the most important moment of the sacrifice itself. The animals are carefully tended in a special cleaning pen (di) for one month before the cere- mony.l10 On the day before the ceremony, while the consecration offi- cers are observing the strict fast, the victims are brought to the "spirit 104 Brian Smith and Wendy Doniger, "Sacrifice and Substitution: Ritual Mystification and Mythical Demythification," Numen 36 (1989): 196-207. 105 Hubert and Mauss, p. 35. 106 Satapatha-Brahmana (n. 71 above), XI.2.8.2-3. 107 Rg-Veda 10.90.11-16.

The supervising officer leads the other participants to the kit- chen, inspects the kitchen utensils and ritual vessels for cleanliness and the victims for plumpness. The victims are slaughtered and the supervis- ing officer takes the blood and some fur in a pan, and the animals are doused with boiling water. 11 The function of the separation of the victim from the rest of the herd and the lengthy period of cleansing in a special pen is not explained in the ritual manuals. The cleansing of victims and bathing of sacrificers prior to the ceremony suggest a parallel that may be conducive to semi- otic analysis, although I refrain from doing so, but at the very least these acts imply a purification through reverence in the act of bathing. Clearly this process differs from the consecration of the victim in Vedic rites in which the victim is either identified with the sacrificer or associated with the gods that will receive the offerings. The victim of Vedic sacrifice ceases to be what it appears to be: a living animal that is to be slaugh- tered and eaten.112 Rather, it stands for, represents, or is a counterpart to something else: sacrificer, god, and ultimately both. But the animal as victim will never stand for itself alone.113 The victim in Confucian sacrifice clearly stoodfor, indeed, simply was itself. The literal status of the victim explains why concern for animals used in sacrifice has a long history in Confucian ritual theory, even though, in the end, the animal must be slaughtered.114 When a disciple wanted to dispense with the slaughter of a goat in a sacrifice, Confucius set his priorities right: "You love the goat, I love the rite."115 Mencius uses a consecration rite to speak about another concern-humanity-in a Gongyang zhuan zhushu, comp. He Xiu and Xu Yan (Shisan jing zhushu, 1816), 15.84. The victim is sprinkled with water in Vedic sacrifice to make it "sacrificially pure" before the sacrifice and after its slaughter to restore it to immortal life so that the gods may con- sume it.

This is a literal rendering of a com- plicated and elliptical passage. Until the end of the seventh century B.C.E. the king slaugh- tered lambs at rites to greet the new year. Half a century after the rite ceased to be observed animals were still kept in the event that the king should revive the rite. Confucius's dis- ciple lamented the waste of the herd, for it could more usefully serve other purposes. Con- fucius lamented the loss of the rite and wanted the animals kept ready for the rite were it to be restored. 280</page><page sequence="31">History of Religions conversation with a king, but the ultimate necessity of the rite is never questioned: Mencius recalls the king's sense of empathy when he saw the calf pulled through the hall to be slaughtered for a consecration rite. Mencius repeats the king's earlier words: "Don't use it. I can't bear to see it suffer like a guiltless man about to be executed." When asked if the consecration rite should be dispensed with, the king had replied, "How can it be dispensed with? Use a goat instead."116 This passage often con- founds the modern readers' ethological sensibilities, but Mencius, ever optimistic, sees in the ruler's inclination to save the life of an animal that he himself saw being led to slaughter proof of an innate sense of com- passion that cannot endure the suffering of others. The time-honored principle expressed by Mencius in the adage, "The gentleman keeps his distance from the kitchen," was also enunciated in liturgical texts such as the "Jade Pendants" chapter of the Record of Rites.117 This taboo was codified in the ritual statutes of the Tang dynasty, and, reaffirmed in 1369, when the first emperor of the Ming had the rite of the victim's slaughter moved two hundred paces from the spirit altar. Linking the ancient ritual taboo with Mencian philosophy, he observed that the slaughter of sacrificial victims took place too close to the spirit altar, which was "unsettling to the human heart."118 In spite of its nonmetaphorical status as food the remaining sacrificial meat was residually affected by its contact with the gods. Once offered to the gods and spirits, sacrificial meat was said to be blessed (fu) and to bring prosperity (lii) to those who ate it.119 After the ceremony the meat was divided among the participants on the basis of rank and consumed in their homes.'20 The Record of Rites says that when dividing the meat, the left chuck is cut into nine pieces, while the right chuck is offered in sacrifice.121 The Rites of Zhou says that "whoever receives sacrificial meat receives the assistance of the ghosts and spirits" to whom it was offered.122 These passages are adduced in commentaries on Analects 10.9, which says, "When assisting the lord in sacrifice at public temples, the Master did not keep the meat given him overnight."

The principal consecration officer received five animals, surrogates and cloister consecration officers re- ceived thirty jin, assistants received twenty jin, etc. In 1373 the court determined that only those officials present at the sacrifice would receive a portion of the meat.

In Vedic sacri- fice the god Prajapati created animal sacrificefor himself, and, through a series of substitutions, of himself, whereby the animal that is slaughtered stands for the human sacrificer and ultimately Prajapati. Vedic sacrifice thus serves to ameliorate and finally dissolve any difference between man and god. In ancient Hebrew sacrifice the victim constitutes an offer- ing-often in recompense-to God according to specific ritual proce- dures spelled out by God to Moses. Thus God devised sacrifice in ancient Hebrew ritual as a gift to himself from the people of Israel, but in this instance a sacred-profane dichotomy is reaffirmed in that the victim does not substitute for people or god, but a sin or transgression committed by a guilty person who is expiated through the slaughter of a victim (and sometimes simultaneous release of another). In both cases, Vedic and Hebrew, god as the originator and creator of all things primordially pre- cedes mortals and stands apart from the human world. Sacrifice crosses a sacred-profane divide in different ways: dissolving it in the former and preserving it in the latter. Such dichotomies appear less distinct in ancient Greece, where the gods that received sacrifice were descendants of mortal men (there were no women before the first sacrifice), the Titans. They were distinguished from one another geographically, by the power they wielded, and by the fact that gods did not die.125 Sacrifice becomes the definitive marker of differentiation between the gods and men in a complex narrative in which Prometheus tricks Zeus into accepting an ox's bones covered in glistening fat rather than the meat that had been concealed by the ox's 123 My translation of Lunyu 10.9 is based on the commentary in Lunyu zhengyi, 12.223. 124 Burkert ([n. 71 above], pp. 12-22) bases his thesis that sacrifice is universal and the oldest form of religious action on a problematic evolutionary argument that it is an instinc- tual human practice that grew out of primitive hunting cultures. For a critique of Burkert's evolutionism, see Nancy Jay, Throughout Your Generations Forever: Sacrifice, Religion, and Paternity (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), pp. 132-33. Without assert- ing that sacrifice is innate, Lewis argues that ancient Chinese sacrifice is linked to the hunt and battle.

But Zeus, "whose designs never fail" evidently had it out for the scheming Prometheus and the mortal Titans from the beginning and delivers his ultimate revenge in his gift of Pandora as bride to Prome- theus's "misguided" brother.126 The Greek sacrifice of the victim's bones covered in glistening fat was only a tacit creation of Zeus, in spite of Prometheus's hubris in thinking that he had tricked Zeus into accepting the inferior part of the ox, whereas he had actually incurred Zeus's wrath upon all mortals forever.127 Such myths intertwine the lives of gods and mortals through the gods' intercession in the human world-usually mo- tivated by love and passion-with consequences that rebound back upon life on Olympus. The ritual canons of classical China describe the sacrifices to Heaven and the spirits of the royal ancestors as they were offered by ancient sov- ereigns without reference to a particular moment of divine invention of sacrifice or a revelation of its meaning to humans. Classical sources name the sovereign as the Son of Heaven without elucidating the precise nature of his descent from Heaven. Later readers of the ritual canons were simply presented with a separation between Heaven and mortals that was mediated by the sovereign by means of pious devotion and sacrifice. This same logic of sacrifice applied to the relations between gods and sacrificer in other cults of the middle and lower tiers. Filiality was the primary sentiment of the sovereign-sacrificer in both the rites to Heaven and to the royal ancestors.128 A more general sense of reverence provided the basis of the sovereign's sacrifices to the gods of soils and grains, which, as we have seen, became the liturgical template for sacri- fices to Confucius. Western experts on the Orient have long understood Confucius as a philosopher concerned primarily with ethics and governing. He is some- times quoted as urging his followers to concern themselves with duties toward the people and to keep the spirits at a distance. Modern scholars often assert that he did not believe spirits existed or at least that he was skeptical of their existence.129 How does the cult veneration of Con- fucius change our understanding of Confucianism as a religion? Some scholars have recently endeavored to recover a "religious" Confucius by 126 Hesiod, Theogony, trans. M. L. West (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), lines 512-616. 127 Vernant, "The Myth of Prometheus in Hesiod," in his Myth and Society, pp. 183- 201. 128 Marcel Granet, The Religion of the Chinese People, trans.

(n. 66 above). 283</page><page sequence="34">Sacrifice and the Imperial Cult of Confucius explicating the Analects on the basis of Mencius's position that Heaven conferred upon the living an innate potential to be good.130 This source of goodness, called ren, usually translated as "humanity" or "benevolence," became the foundation upon which later Confucians un- derstood the quest for human perfection through moral self-cultivation. Late imperial Confucians drew a religious faith from the belief that Heaven endowed them with the potential for sagehood. As such, Heaven is regarded as a divine originator of goodness and primordial source from which those seeking sagehood must draw to realize the good. Confucians were deeply divided along sectarian lines over how one should pursue this quest, but rarely were they in doubt about its ul- timate validity.131 The argument that moral self-cultivation aimed at inner spiritual per- fection constituted the archetypal moment of Confucian religiosity, how- ever, overlooks the importance of the ritual feasting of the gods and spirits of the imperial pantheon. Given the geographic extent of imperial cults and the pervasive role that Confucian officers of the bureaucracy played in the veneration of the gods, it is no exaggeration to say that sacrifice affected how Confucians understood their relations with di- vinities as deeply as moral self-cultivation informed their conception of Heaven as the divine source of human goodness. Offering sacrifice to Heaven, imperial ancestors, Confucius, and other gods and spirits was part of a disciplinary apparatus that constituted the Confucian body in ways that resist philosophical analysis of the order applied to the body of ideas in the Analects. The reciprocity between gods and mortals in cult veneration produced a self as a ritualized body imbricated in a process of exchange that served to maintain the proper working of the cosmos: Heaven and Earth, the imperium, nature, human labor in the fields and interaction at home and in society. Inner, spiritual transformation as the goal of moral self-cultivation was a possible effect of participating in rit- ual feasting of gods, but it was not integral to sacrifice. The locus of the "religious" moment of sacrifice is not the inner spirit but in the exchange between mortals and gods who work together to sustain the proper work- ing of the cosmos. 130 Mencius 2A.6, 6A.1-4.
