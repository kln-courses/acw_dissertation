<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pagan-Christian Debates over the Interpretation of Texts in Late Antiquity1 ABSTRACT: This article discusses ancient debates between Christian and poly theist writers over the allegorical interpretations of sacred texts. These disputes are set in the wider context of the "the battles of the books" in Late Antiquity. Many similarities and continuities are shown in the interpretative approaches to sacred texts, even though the Christian and polytheist writers themselves often tried to downplay these similarities and to construe differences instead. The article examines the use of allegorical interpretation as a defense of sa cred texts, often against the polemic launched from opposing religious groups. I. Introduction "You do not believe our writings, and we do not believe yours," the early fourth-century Christian apologist Arnobius of Sicca writes in his work Against Pagans (Adversus nationes).2 In this manner he describes the mutual suspicion between pagan Romans and Christians towards each other's sacred myths and texts. Arnobius is well aware of the desperate deadlock between the two sides: what one considers holy and true is regarded as false by the other. He knows that both sides attack each other, accusing one another of propagating false hoods about their own deity or deities. He continues, You claim that we invent falsehoods about Christ—we say that you put forth groundless and false stories about your gods. . . . You claim that these were writ ten by humans—we say that those were written by humans—set forth in mortal speech. And whatever you intend to say about our writers, you will have to suffer the same said with equal force about your writers, too. What is contained in your writings, you wish to be treated as true; and those things that are attested in our books, you must of necessity confess to be true. You accuse our things of falsehood; and we accuse your things of falsehood.3 During the second, third, and fourth centuries, the authority and prestige of texts was intensely disputed in the learned controversies between pagans and Christians. The reliability of pagan and Christian myths and histories, respectively, was questioned, and the allegorical and other kinds of interpretations of texts were connected with this quest for authority and esteem. Many of these debates, "the battles 1 The research for this article has been supported by the Finnish Academy and the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies (University of Helsinki, Finland).

The purpose of this article is to shed light on the ancient disputes over the interpretation of these more or less sacred texts. The diverse interpretative techniques, hermeneutical principles, and allegorical read ings that flourished in Greco-Roman, Jewish, and Christian learned circles have been meticulously analyzed by a considerable number of modern scholars.4 Therefore, my aim is not to contribute to the details of techniques or philosophical conceptions. Instead, I will focus on the disputes between Christian and pagan interpreters, setting them in the wider context of "the battles of the books."5 I hope to demonstrate that there were remarkable similarities and continuities in the approaches to sacred texts, even though the Christian and pagan writers themselves tended to downplay these similarities and instead construct differences. First, I discuss the ancient myth critique and the use of allegorical interpretation as a defense and justification of the myths and texts, often against the disparagement of sacred tales and myths launched from the opposing camp.6 Then, I investigate the mutual critiques and attacks on the allegorical interpretations.7 Nonetheless, some thinkers 4 Just to mention a few: R.

Both disputes fuelled the can onization process of Jewish-Christian texts into the Christian Bible as we know it today. 6 In this article, I use the English word "allegory" in the modern sense of the word, that is, the hidden meaning. The Oxford English Dictionary Online defines al legory first, as "description of a subject under the guise of some other subject of aptly suggestive resemblance," and second, "an instance of such description; a figurative sentence, discourse, or narrative, in which properties and circumstances attributed to the apparent subject really refer to the subject they are meant to suggest; an extended or continued metaphor," and third, "an allegorical representation; an emblem." 7 In antiquity, the Greek word allegoria in its standard definition was "saying what is other—that is, saying or meaning something other than what one seems to say." The word allegoria referred to irony or sarcasm as well (which is also saying something other than what one seems to say). There was also the Greek term hyponoia, "hidden thought," "seeing under," "underlying meaning," which was used to refer to allegori cal understanding until the term allegoria became more frequent in the first century B.C.E.

Next, I examine which texts were regarded as suitable or worthy of allegorical interpretation and what kinds of criteria were appealed to in the argumentation. Finally, I demonstrate that Christian and pagan writers made strikingly similar demands for reciprocity and goodwill in reading and interpreting sacred texts. II. Myth Critique and Defensive Allegory From the sixth century B.C.E. onwards, Greek myths had been criticized for shamelessness and absurdity by Greek intellectuals. Xenophanes (c. 570-c. 475) is known to have scoffed at Homer and Hesiod for their shameful accounts of gods with human vices and passions. Plato—using Socrates as his mouthpiece—attacked myths in general and Homer in particular in his Republic, in which he de nounced Homer as unfit for the education of children because they were not capable of seeing beyond the literal meanings.8 Uncomfortable, offensive, and obscure myths and textual pas sages-such as the numerous obscenities of Zeus and the adultery of Ares and Aphrodite—demanded elucidation and vindication. An apposite response to the myth critique was allegorical interpretation, which Robert Lamberton calls "defensive allegory."9 The earliest known defender of Homer was Theagenes of Rhegium, a Pythagorean philosopher in the sixth century B.C.E.10 According to the Greek defenders of myths, an ethically and philosophically acceptable meaning—the deeper, genuine, and hidden significance—was revealed under the veil of discomforting myths. The first- or second-century C.E. interpreter of Homer, Heraclitus (or Pseudo-Heraclitus), stated in his Homeric Problems that if Homer "meant nothing allegorically, he would be completely impious."11 Consequently, mythology became philosophia moralis. In this process, there was no need to abandon mythology because of its im moralities, since in an allegorical reading moral teachings or physical or psychological phenomena could be derived from myths. Allegorical interpretation reached its height in the Stoic philosophers who construed 8 Xenophan. fr. 11, H. Diels and W.

One of the best-known examples of allegorical interpretation is the Neoplatonic reading of the entire epic of the Odyssey as the journey of the human soul towards its home. The preceding philosophical tradition had already spiritualized the Odyssey as the progress or wanderings of the soul; the earliest evidence for this is the second-century C.E. Platonists and Neopythagoreans. As is well known, this interpretation is also found in The Cave of the Nymphs written by the third-century Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry of Tyre, who explains the descrip tion of the cave of the nymphs in Odyssey (13.109-111) as the image of the universe.13 A similar example of allegorical interpretation is the reading of Vergil's Aeneid (6.126-129) in which the rivers of the underworld, the "ninefold Styx," are interpreted by Servius, a fifth century commentator on Vergil, as the nine spheres of the universe.14 As late as in the fifth century C.E., the Neoplatonist Proclus wrote two essays in defense of Homer in his commentary to Plato's Republic.15 According to Proclus, the poets had adapted eternal truths to the needs of human language and storytelling because the truth required a screen (parapetasma) that both revealed and masked the truth.16 Not only were texts such as Homer and Hesiod read symbolically, revealing eternal truths, but mysteries also received their share of al legorical interpretations. One example is the allegorical explanation of the cult of Cybele and Attis by Greek and Roman intellectuals: in some of these interpretations, Cybele represented the earth while Attis was regarded as the annual cycle of crops.17 12 J.-B. Gourinat, "Explicatio fabularum: La place de l'allegorie dans I'interpretation stoi'cienne de la mythologie," in Dahan and Goulet (above, n.4) 9-34; Dawson (above, n.4) 24-33.

It has even been suggested that Proclus not only responded to the Greek criticism against Homer over the many past centuries, but his defense of Homer could also be an indirect response to Christian disparagement, such as that of Clement of Alexandria in Protrepticus.

Hellenizing Jews of Alexandria such Philo of Alexandria (20 B.C.E.-40 C.E.) aimed to find justification for their own tradition in educated Greek circles. In fact, Philo adapted Stoic textual exegesis but in a Platonized form, looking for Platonic philosophical truths in biblical texts.18 Christian writers also felt obliged to clarify and justify uncomfort able and obscure myths and textual passages—such as the creation of Adam and Eve, the promiscuity of Lot and his daughters, the absurdities of Mosaic Law, and the "cannibalism" of the Eucharist. In defense of their sacred texts, Christian intellectuals made use of the allegorical reading that they had adopted from both Jewish apologetics and the philosophical interpretation of Greek myths by Stoics and Platonists.19 As can be observed in the criticism made by Greek philosophers against Greek myths, much of the disparagement of sacred tales and texts emerged within the textual communities themselves. Nonetheless, the most vitriolic attacks against myths and sacred texts seem to have materialized in the context of competition between religious groups. Christian and pagan polemicists alike attacked the embarrassing and seemingly absurd stories and passages in the other's tradition.20 Pagan writers such as the second-century Platonist Celsus highlighted passages from the Jewish-Christian Scriptures, disparaging unbelievable fables, the obscure language of prophets, inconsistencies in the gospels, an anthropomorphic god, incarnation, and resurrection.21 The anonymous 3.11 and Aug. civ. 7.25). In the fifth century, Macrobius explained Cybele and Attis as the earth and the sun in his Saturnalia (1.21.7-10). Another example is from Plutarch of Chaeronea, who interprets both the myth and mysteries of Isis and Osiris in a mystical sense and also connects them to the mysteries of Dionysus; see Brisson (above, n.4) 64-71. Similarly, the fifth-century Neoplatonist Proclus aimed at assimilating myths and mysteries in his symbolic interpretation of Homer, Hesiod, Orphic texts, and Chaldaean oracles; see Marin, v. Procl. 33; Kuisma (above, n.15) 39-45; A. Sheppard, Studies on the 5th and 6th Essays of Proclus' Commentary on the Republic (Gottingen 1980) 145-61. 18 For Philo and other Hellenizing Jewish allegorical interpretations of Mosaic Law, e.g., the letter of Aristeas (around 127-118 B.C.E.), see Pepin (above, n.4), 5; Hanson (above, n.4) 43-53; C. Blonnigen, Der griechische Ursprung der jiidisch-hel lenistischen Allegorese und ihre Rezeption in der alexandrinischen Patristik (Frankfurt 1992) 57-63, 89-99; P. Fredriksen, Augustine and the Jews: A Christian Defense of Jews and Judaism (New York 2008) 47-50, and most recently, M. Niehoff, Jewish Exegesis and Homeric Scholarship in Alexandria (Cambridge 2011). 19 Allegorical interpretations are already found in New Testament writings as well as in the Epistle of Barnabas and the writings of Hippolytus of Rome. For the Platonic and Stoic influences on Christian interpretative techniques and especially allegorical reading, see D. G. McCartney, "Literal and Allegorical Interpretation in Origen's Contra Celsum," Westminster Theological Journal 48 (1986) 282-85. 20 In the debates between Jewish and Christian thinkers, most of the disputants held most of the same texts in esteem. What was debated was the correct understand ing of and the interpretative keys for the Scriptures. See J. Lieu, Christian Identity in the Jewish and Graeco-Roman World (Oxford 2004) 43-47. 21 Celsus in Orig. Cels. 1.7; 7.9, and passim. Celsus' original text has not survived but his arguments have been reconstructed from the quotations in Origen's response. For the debate between Origen and Celsus, see Fedou (below, n.25) and M. Frede, "Origen's Treatise Against Celsus," M. Edwards, M. Goodman, and S. Price, eds., Apologetics in the Roman Empire: Pagans, Jews, and Christians (Oxford 1999) 131-55.</page><page sequence="6">530 Maijastina Kahlos non-Christian interlocutor in the fourth-century treatise Apocriticus by Macarius of Magnesia accuses the Jewish-Christian Scriptures of being fictional, inconsistent, and based on secondhand knowledge.22 Christian writers advanced similar objections against the pagan tales of the gods, interpreting classical pagan myths and poetry in an exclusively literal sense. Christian polemicists considered the pagan myths immoral and inconsistent, making ample use of the myth critique already developed by Greek and Roman philosophers. Consequently, the attacks against the immorality of myths became commonplace in the polemics of second- and third-century apologists. Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-215) ridiculed the credulous pagans who believed even in the most outrageous tales. Arnobius of Sicca wrote the fifth book of his Against Pagans to show the fallacy of pagan myths.23 In the early fifth century, Augustine of Hippo stated that pagan poets and priests had allied with one another in a fellowship of falsehood (consortio falsitatis) and together sowed and harvested a crop of shame by inventing foul stories about the gods. While the one sang the appalling fictions of human imagination about the gods, the other consecrated those fictions in their celebrations.24 III. Christian Allegorical Reading and Pagan Criticism The disparagement of sacred tales and texts by religious rivals could be countered with elaborate allegorical interpretation. Allegorical reading, however, in its turn was also attacked by religious opponents. Pagan writers attacked Christian allegorical readings of the Scrip tures. For example, Celsus labeled the biblical stories, especially about Moses, as stupid fictions (plasmata) that Christians erroneously inter preted allegorically. He insisted that the Mosaic stories do not allow figurative meaning. Christians and Jews were so ashamed of their tales that they took refuge in allegory, Celsus asserted. Moreover, he added that Christians' allegorical explanations are even more disgraceful and absurd than the stories themselves since they attempt to bring together amazing and insensate follies that cannot be harmonized.25 Porphyry criticized Christians, especially Origen, for allegori cal interpretations: some Christians themselves resorted to allegories because they wanted to "find a solution to the vileness of the Jewish 22 In Mac. Magn. apocr. 2.28-29 Goulet (= Porph. c. Chr. fr. 15 Harnack). The anonymous non-Christian interlocutor in Macarius' Apocriticus (also called Mono genes) has often been identified as Porphyry of Tyre, e.g., by R. Goulet, Macarios de Magnesie: Le Monogenes (Paris 2003) 1381-340, and A. von Harnack, Porphyrius. "Gegen die Christen" (Berlin 1916). 23 Clem. prot. 1. For Arnobius' attack, see F.

Symm. 1.159-63) on the disgrace of young women, illicit love for young men, and adultery in pagan myths. The shamefulness of myths was a regular theme in Christian invectives; see M.

They cannot extract rational explanations from their texts, therefore, they boast that "the plain words of Moses are enigmas," and "regard them as oracles full of hidden mysteries." Then, having confused the rational mind with smoke, or conceit, they make their exegeses.26 In another controversial passage, Porphyry may have illustrated the irrationality of Christian allegorical readings by showing with an example the absurd consequences of allegorizing. In a fragment of the Commentary on Ecclesiastes, Didymus of Alexandria writes that Porphyry interpreted the rivalry between Achilles and Hector in the Iliad (probably 12.462-71)27 as an allegory of Christ and the devil.28 The modern scholarly interpretations of the passage vary, depending on how modern scholars evaluate Porphyry. The allegory offered by Porphyry has usually been considered a parody of the Christian exegesis: thus, Porphyry aims at demonstrating the irrationality of Christian allegorical readings by showing with an example how absurd the consequences of allegorizing are.29 Whatever the case, Achilles was from time to time associated with Christ in the later tradition.30 26 Eus. eccl. 6.19.4-9 (=fr. 12 T Smith = Porph. Chr. fr. 39 Harnack). The main target of Porphyry's attack is Origen, whom he criticizes for, among other things, adopting the symbolical reading that he had learned from the works of Chaeremon and Cornutus and adapting it to Jewish Scriptures.

Baumbach, H. Kohler, and A. M. Ritter, eds., Mousopolos Stephanos (Heidelberg 1998) 330-31. For the prob lems concerning the identification of the Origen mentioned in the passage, see R.

Sellew, "Achilles or Christ: Porphyry and Didymus in Debate Over Allegori cal Interpretation," HThR 82 (1989) 83, regards Iliad 9.236 as another possible point of reference here (Ajax appeals to Achilles to rejoin the battle in which the Trojans and Hector are having the upper hand since Achilles is absent) or 12.436-471 (Hector leads a successful breach of the Achaean defenses). 28 Didym. comm. in eccles. 9.10; the fragment was first published by G.

Sellew (above, n.27) 82 fills the gap in the fragment and translates: "Now then Porphyry, who wants [to reproach us for doing violence to the literal] meanings, has [himself] allegorized. . . P. F. Beatrice, "Didyme L'Aveugle et la tradition de l'allegorie," in G. Dorival and A. Le Boulluec, eds., Origeniana Sexta: Origene et la Bible (Leuven 1995) 589-90, fills the gap by referring to Origen who, according to Beatrice, could have been the original interpreter of Achilles and Hector as Christ and the devil. 29 The passage is read as sarcasm by Binder (above, n.28) 94 and T. D. Barnes, "Porphyry Against the Christians: Date and the Attribution of Fragments," JThS 24 (1973) 428; as showing the superiority of the Greek tradition by Sellew (above, n.27) 99-100 and Cook (above, n.26) 163-64, who regards Porphyry's allegory as an attempt to show that the Greek philosophical tradition offered even better ways of expressing the truths that Christians found in the opposition of Christ and the devil. 30 E.g., Constantine in his Oratio ad coetum sanctorum 20 quoting Verg. Eel. 4.31-36 (in Eus. v. Const. 4.32). See M. Edwards, Constantine and Christendom: The Oration</page><page sequence="8">532 MAIJASTINA kahlos In the letter concerning his School Edict in 362, the Emperor Julian denounces Christian teachers who expound on Greek poets such as Homer and Hesiod and poison their pupils' minds by describing the poets as filled with impiety, folly, and error.31 Furthermore, Julian attacked the Christian allegorical readings, mocking them as the "Hellenization" of the Christian Scriptures. He exclaimed: "If the reading of your own writings is sufficient for you, why do you nibble at the learning of the Hellenes?"32 In Julian's view, allegorical reading was legitimate for Greek myths and rituals. For example, in his hymn to the Mother of gods (or. 5), he explains the cult of Cybele and Attis allegorically. Furthermore, in the hymn to Helios, he clarifies Greek myths figuratively in order to enhance his solar theology. However, in the very same hymn to Helios, Julian states that, along with the divine, there is also much that is only human in the poets' stories. Ordinary people derive benefit from the myths while those who are more sublimely endowed with wisdom will discover the truth about the gods.33 For Julian, myths were reserved for lesser minds while divine truths are for more advanced minds. In a way, in this view the more philosophical minds do not need myths and allegories; they have access to the direct revelation. The anonymous non-Christian interlocutor in Macarius of Mag nesia's Apocriticus mocked the passage in the Gospel of John (6:53), "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you." This anonymous opponent did not regard it as worthy of allegorical interpretation because the literal meaning was abhorrent—cannibalism—but with the help of an allegorical interpreta tion Christians invested it with a mystic and appropriate meaning.34 IV. Pagan Allegorical Reading and Christian Criticism Christian writers, in turn, questioned and reviled the allegorical reading of Greek myths and mysteries.35 Origen's response to Celsus' to the Saints: The Greek and Latin Accounts of the Discovery of the Cross: The Edict of Constantine to Pope Silvester (Liverpool 2003) 50, and A. Wlosok, "Zwei Beispiele friihchristlicher 'Vergilrezeption': Polemik (Lact., div. inst. 5,10) und Usurpation (Or. Const. 19-21)," in V. Poschl, ed., 2000 Jahre Vergil: Ein Symposion (Wiesbaden 1983) 68-71. 31 According to Lamberton (above, n.9) 136-39, Julian associates allegorical reading with the "muddled vulgarization of the Christians," excluding it from his purer religion. Lamberton uses Julian's letter on Christian teachers (Iul. ep. 42.423a-b Hertlein = 61c Bidez-Cumont = 36 Wright) as an example of the emperor's mischief. Lamberton, how ever, does not place the letter in the context of Julian's School Edict. One of Julian's motives was possibly to marginalize Christianity to the extent of cultural oblivion in Late Antique society where classical Greek education (paideia) was fundamental to, for instance, a public career. For the School Edict, see R. Smith, Julian's Gods: Religion and Philosophy in the Thought and Action of Julian the Apostate (London 1995) 114, 212-13; T. M. Banchich, "Julian's School Laws: Cod.

Consequently, Origen denounces the allegorical interpretations of Greek myths: the Greeks are themselves so ashamed of their myths that they try to make their obscene fic tion look less shameful and more mysterious. He then lists Greek myths such as the castration of Uranos as well as Kronos devouring his children.36 The above-mentioned allegorical interpretations of Greek and Roman cults and mysteries were amply ridiculed by Christian po lemicists. One of the most attacked allegorical explanations was that of Cybele and Attis. In the early fourth century, Arnobius of Sicca mocked the allegorical interpretations of mysteries, especially in the cult of Cybele, composed by Greek and Roman intellectuals. Arnobius states that these intellectuals wanted to see wonderful and profound meanings (rationes miras atque altas) in these mysteries that otherwise looked shameful. He writes, "One thing is said but another thing is understood." Arnobius ridicules the interpretations in which "under the vulgar simplicity of speech there is hidden a secret meaning and obscure profundity of mystery."37 In the early fifth cen tury, Augustine of Hippo stated that, in the case of Cybele's eunuch priests, galli, "the interpretation failed, reason blushed and eloquence fell silent."38 Augustine also mocked the pagan, especially Stoically inspired, attempts to save the myths by interpreting the gods as the elements.39 He pointed out that allegorical interpretation made myths more tolerable and justifiable to pagan intellectuals.40 The late fourth-century exegete and bishop Diodorus of Tarsus from the Christian Antiochene school defended the literal interpreta tions and warned against the dangers of the allegorical method in his exegetical writings.41 He states that the Scriptures are divinely inspired. Thus, the events in the Scriptures are also historical and therefore the historical level must be taken into consideration. The historical or. 21 (=Metrodor. fr.

This they do by ignoring the literal, historical level, he writes, and adds that keeping with the historical sense rids Christians of Hellenism—"of saying one thing and meaning another and introducing absurdities." Furthermore, it frees Christians from Judaism and from settling "for the literal sense alone." Christian interpreters, in contrast, will do things in a much different way, proceeding from the literal level "further to a more elevated understanding."44 In order to demonstrate the Christian way of exegesis, Diodorus refers to St. Paul's interpretation of the story of Hagar and Sarah (Gal 4:24) in which Paul does not deny the historical level while also interpreting the story on the symbolic level. Diodorus takes the capture of Europa by Zeus and the incestuous marriage between Zeus and Hera as examples of pagan allegorizing of myths. G. Rinaldi proposes that Diodorus' aversion to the allegorical reading is con nected to the Emperor Julian's pro-pagan policy and polemic against Christians.45 The impetus for Diodorus' criticism against allegorical readings was the allegorical interpretation of pagan myths and cults by Julian and the writer of On the Gods and the Universe, Sallustius, in the 360s.46 It has also been suggested that Diodorus knew Porphyry's anti-Christian polemic and partly responded to it.47 This is very likely the background for Diodorus' discussion but I would like to add some nuances. Diodorus clearly (as Rinaldi also suggests) wants to distance Christian allegorical interpretation from pagan allegorical readings such as those of Julian and Sallustius, stressing the difference between pagans and Christians.48 Similarly, Origen emphasized the difference between pagan and Christian in terpretation in his debate with Celsus. Furthermore, I see Diodorus' discussion as connected to the boundary-marking between the various Christian schools of interpretation: the rival Christian exegetes saw 42 Diod. comm. in psalm, prol.; CCSG 6, ed.

For its part, the Christian An tiochene school appeared as following the more literal and historical approach to the Scriptures.49 As the representative of the Antiochene school, Diodorus labels the allegorical method (or what he considers the allegorical method of his rivals) as Hellenic—in the sense of pa gan.50 This pagan label was also a useful tool when slandering one's fellow-Christian rivals in the area of scriptural interpretation. As a matter of fact, labeling either as pagan or Jewish was a frequently used rhetorical technique against theological rivals: the opponents were portrayed either as paganizing or Judaizing.51 Some late waves of the dispute are discernible in Macrobius' Saturnalia. One of the interlocutors of the fictional symposium is Euangelus, who is the only interlocutor depicted in an unfavorable light. He fails to understand the depths in the layering of meanings in Vergil. It has even been suggested that the character of Euangelus is a caricature of a Christian; even the name Euangelus could imply the religious allegiance of the character. Consequently, Euangelus might be a caricature of a Christian who refuses to assign allegorical interpretation to pagan texts and insists on reading them only liter ally.52 One of Macrobius' Christian contemporaries who criticized the 49 These differences by no means suggest any crude dichotomy between Alexandrian allegory and Antiochene literalism; instead, Christian scholars of both schools made use of various techniques of interpretation. The dichotomy originates from the polemic between Christian exegetical schools in which the positions tend to be polarized. For the criticism against sharp divisions between Alexandrian and Antiochene schools of interpretation, see Young (above, n.4) 161-85; F. Young, "The Fourth Century Reaction against Allegory," Studia Patristica 30 (1997) 120-25; and M. M. Mitchell ("Patristic Rhetoric on Allegory: Origen and Eustathius Put 1 Samuel 28 on Trial," JR 85 [2005] 421-41), who depicts the controversy between Origen of Alexandria and Eustathius of Antioch as an example of the polarizing rhetoric between rival exegetical traditions. 50 In the course of the fifth century, the term "Hellenic" could be used in a vague way, referring to "Greek" in a linguistic, ethnic, and cultural sense as well as to "pagan" in a religious sense. Diodorus (comm. in psalm, praef.) clearly refers to Hellenism in the sense of paganism in relation to Judaism and Christianity. A number of other Christian writers, such as Gregory of Nazianzus, argued Hellenism foremost as Greek paideia. For the various meanings of Hellenism, see Elm (above, n.31) 494, 505-506 and Kahlos (above, n.24) 20-22. 51 E.g., Athanasius of Alexandria (or. c. Ar. 3.16; 4.10) labeled his "Arian" oppo nents as pagans. For the polemical tools of paganizing and Judaizing one's opponents, see Kahlos (above, n.24) 16-17. 52 Macr. Sat. 1.24.2-4; 1.24.6-7. MacCormack (above, n.39) 86-87 regards Euange lus as a caricature of a Christian: "The message of this character [Euangelus] was real enough. For generations, some Christians had attacked pagan religion by interpreting classical myth and poetry in an exclusively literal sense." Euangelus, however, is not an exclusively Christian name (and not even a common Christian name). Furthermore, the role of Euangelus in Saturnalia could also be interpreted as that of a Skeptic and as the traditional role of an uninvited and uncouth guest in the symposium literature. For the figure of Euangelus, see A. Cameron, "Vergil and his Commentators," in P. Brown and R. Lizzi Testa, eds., Pagans and Christians in the Roman Empire: The Breaking of a Dialogue (IVth-VIth Century A.D.) (Berlin 2011) 519-21; A.

V. Between and beyond the Battle Lines The battle lines were not always as clear as one might expect. In the debate on allegories, it was important for Origen to remark that Numenius, the second-century Neopythagorean or Platonist, "did not scruple to make use of the words of the (Hebrew) prophets and interpret them allegorically." Numenius was valuable for Origen as an example of a pagan philosopher who studied the Scriptures and valued them "as writings that are allegorical and not stupid."54 On the Christian front, Clement of Alexandria made some reserved concessions in the interpretation of Homer. According to Clement, Homer had borrowed from the Hebrew prophets but either veiled or distorted the true doctrine in his poetry. His poetry could be inter preted as a shield or a "screen" (parapetasma) in front of the hidden truths. For Clement, Homer was an allegorical poet who could be utilized to increase the prestige of the Christian tradition. However, in Clement's eyes, Homer had his limitations and perceived the truth only dimly. His screen was misleading and false.55 Both pagan and Christian authors justified the need for both literal and allegorical meanings by invoking the different intellectual and spiritual levels of their audiences. The superficial, literal level of meaning was within anyone's reach while the deepest sense was reserved exclusively for the small number of the advanced, those initiated into the sacred secrets. For instance, Clement of Alexandria explained that the literal level was only a starting point, fit for the mass of Christians, while the deeper meanings, hidden from these masses, were reserved for those more advanced in Christian myster ies. This is connected to the idea that hidden meanings protect the mysteries from the blasphemy of unworthy people.56 Origen also regarded the literal meaning as useful to the simple whereas deeper, hidden truths are meant for the intelligent. What Origen and his Platonic opponent Celsus agreed on was that the abil ity to understand deeper meanings was a mark of intelligence and 53 E.g., in Aug. civ. 9.16. 54 Orig. Cels. 1.15 (=Numen. fr. lb Des Places): prophets.

See Proclus' use of the term parapetasma (see n.16). Clement (sir. 1.14.66.1) states that Homer has glimmerings of truth. For Clement's discussion on the Greek allegorical reading, see A.

The true knowledge of the gods was masked under the super ficial, literal meaning. Myths shielded the truth from the disrespect of unprepared souls.58 VI. Disputing the Criteria Whose allegorical reading was valid? In the mutual assaults and counterassaults between pagans and Christians, the interpretative strate gies were intensively debated. It is also worth recalling that allegorical interpretation had already been criticized in the early Greek debates on Homer.59 For instance, Stoic-inspired allegorical interpretation was often ridiculed by both Epicureans and the philosophers of the New Academy.60 In the late third century, Porphyry of Tyre implies that his allegorical readings of Homer were questioned.61 Similarly, within Christian circles, allegorical methods had to undergo intensive debate. Different Christian groups respectively defended their own interpreta tive techniques and attacked those of other groups.62 In the late fourth and fifth centuries, the exegetes of the Christian Antiochene School, for instance Diodorus of Tarsus, insisted upon a strictly literal reading of texts and contested the sometimes wild spiritual interpretations for which the Christian Alexandrian School was famous.63 57 Orig. Cels. 1.17-18; 1.27; 3.52; 4.71; 5.42. McCartney (above, n.19) 288, 293; Harl (above, n.9) 353-54. In c. Cels. 1.18, Origen nonetheless contradicts himself by stressing the difference of Jewish-Christian Scriptures from the Greek allegories that are available only to those who are endowed with greater wisdom. Similarly, in the late fourth century, Gregory of Nazianzus (or. 4.115-119) pointed out that the more secret and transcendent sense is "only accessible to a few of the wiser sort." 58 Sallust. mund. 3—4. Sallustius (Salustios), the writer of On the Gods and the Universe, has often been identified with Saturninus Secundus Salutius, the praefectus praetorio Orientis in 361-65 and in 365-67; see G. Rochefort, Saloustios, Des dieux et du monde (Paris 1960) xiv-xxi. 59 E.g., the third- and second-century B.C.E. Alexandrian Greek scholars, "philolo gists," are known to have despised figurative explanations of textual difficulties. For them, a symbolic reading was too easy a solution. J. I. Porter, "Hermeneutic Lines and Circles: Aristarchus and Crates on the Exegesis of Homer," in Lamberton and Keaney (above, n.7) 68, 100 n.87. 60 In Cicero's De natura deorum (1.36-41), Velleius, the representative of Epicureanism, attacks Stoic allegorical readings. Cotta, the spokesman for the New Academy in Cicero's De natura deorum (3.41-44; 3.62-63), follows the critique raised by Carneades against Stoic allegorical readings. Cotta castigates the Stoics for seeking to make sense of lying fables (3.63). Brisson (above, n.4) 49-54. " Porph. antr. 36. Brisson (above, n.4) 85 interprets Porphyry's argumentation in the passage as referring to opposition. 62 This is seen in the defensive argumentation of Origen and Clement of Alex andria against the critique of other Christians, e.g., the Marcionites who disparaged the biblical obscurities. Moreover, the Valentinians, e.g., were criticized for an alle gorical reading of biblical texts.

What were the interpretative keys? One's own sacred texts could be under stood figuratively and thus considered dignified, while rival's texts should be read only literally and consequently seen in a ridiculous light. Is it that simple? For Greek philosophers, the starting point of the allegorical in terpretation of myths was the absurdity of the text. Thus, in defense of myths, the embarrassing, literal level, the surface, was the fore most criterion or clue for seeking deeper, hidden meanings behind the screen. For Porphyry, the absurdity and difficulty of the text was solved by allegory. Sallustius, the writer of On the Gods and the Universe, stated that the words of the myths were veils and the truth was unspeakable. The absurdity was apparent only on the surface. For Sallustius, it was precisely the immorality, strangeness, or inap propriateness (atopia) in myths that was the fundamental indicator that the text was to be read allegorically.64 According to Julian, the absurdity of the myths showed the way to an allegorical reading. Whenever myths were incongruous in thought, in precisely that way they summoned readers not to believe them literally but to study and track down their hidden meaning. Proclus showed that the most tragic and monstrous things stimulated the audience to look for the truth. In this way, people were drawn to secret knowledge.65 Christian writers formulated comparable ideas.66 Augustine outlines the problem in a similar manner in De doctrina Christiana: "Whatever appears in the divine Scripture that does not literally pertain to virtuous behavior or the truth of faith you must take to be figurative."67 As I mentioned earlier, however, the non-Christian opponent in the Apocriticus of Macarius of Magnesia did not accept the passage from John (6:53) as suitable for allegorical interpretation because the passage on the literal level is repulsive and absurd—precisely the kind that Greek philosophers such as Porphyry, Julian, and Sallustius 64 Porph. antr. 2-3; 6. Sallust. mund. 3-4. See Plutarch (Isid. 20 = mor. 358F-359A) for whom it was the absurdity in the details of myths that indicated the need to reveal their hidden meanings.

Nonetheless, Cook (above, n.26) 133, states that Augustine adopted a non-allegorical straightforward exegesis in De consensu evangelistarum to interpret the New Testament in response to Porphyry's attack. True, Augustine insists that a literal meaning should be enhanced but only when it is credible: Aug. civ. 25.8: defendenda mihi historia ne sit scriptura incredibilis; see also 13.21. See MacCormack (above, n.39) 67, n.96.</page><page sequence="15">pagan-Christian debates in Late antiquity 539 regarded as suggesting and indicating a figurative approach.68 Thus, if the literal level, the surface, was unacceptable, it was useless to search for hidden meanings. The surface was no screen. Porphyry contested the Christian allegorical interpretations be cause, he stated, the apparently historical or legal texts such as the Mosaic writings Exodus and Deuteronomy were not to be read alle gorically.69 According to Porphyry, Origen was in error when applying the techniques of Greek exegesis to the wrong literary genres and to foreign texts, that is, the Jewish Scriptures.70 Here, Christian writers aimed at constructing clear boundaries in relation to the Hellenic tradition of interpretation. Origen insisted that there must be some correspondence between the literal and allegori cal meanings. Thus, the literal sense must be historically true so that the allegorical sense is true. In this way, the Christian gospels are superior because they are genuine history—unlike the Greek myths.71 The most significant difference between pagan and Christian inter pretation here lay in the emphasis on the historical level: for most Christian exegetes, historicity constituted the key for the interpreta tion of the Scriptures.72 However, not all Christian writers shared this idea of the acceptability of the historical layer: in his attack against the allegorical interpretation of Greek myths, Arnobius rejected these readings precisely because of their historical character. He insisted that, if the causes and origins of the mysteries were traced to past events, these could by no twist be turned into allegories. Arnobius nonetheless cannot be regarded as an emblematic Christian exegete.73 Origen regarded the organic connection between the spirit (the figurative sense) and the letter (the literal sense) as the principal dif ference from the pagan interpretation. Gregory of Nazianzus outlined similar ideas in his attack against the Emperor Julian. Both Origen and Gregory believed that pagans invested the myth with a meaning that had no connection with the original literal meaning, whereas, in the Christian interpretation, both literal and symbolic senses were possible and acceptable. The surface had to be acceptable too. It should not, for instance, injure the young, as Origen puts it, clearly referring to Plato.74 68 Mac. Magn. apocr. 3.103 Goulet (=Porph. Chr. fr. 69 Harnack).

For a text to be authoritative and suitable for allegorical reading, it had to be of divine origin. In an ironic twist, for a text to be divine, it had to contain an allegorical meaning. To be able to discover an allegorical sense in a text, one must have a hermeneutical approach based on this circular reasoning, that is, to regard the very text as divine.75 Origen stated that the Logos of God arranged the Scriptures and spoke through them.76 Origen's opponent Celsus did not object to the allegorical method as such: what he was against was the allegorical reading of the Jewish-Christian Scriptures. Because these could not be interpreted allegorically, they were not divine. And since they were not divine, they were inappropriate for an allegorical reading. In his defense, Origen also falls into this vicious circle, stating that the Scriptures are divinely inspired because they bear hidden meanings; and vice versa, they must have these hidden meanings because they are divine revelation.77 In addition to remaining in this vicious circle, one considered one's own sacred texts as divine revelation, whereas the other's sacred texts were regarded only as human fiction. For example, Julian wrote that there was nothing divine in the fabrications of the Galileans (Chris tians); they were mere human fiction inspired by wickedness. Julian also stated that Christians, who erroneously and foolishly regarded their writings as divine, ascribed the Hellenic writings to Satan and those who worshipped Satan.78 In his counterattack against Hellenic myths and allegories, Gregory of Nazianzus states that the Hellenic speculation has no solid foundation. Greek wisdom has no divine inspiration.79 Both sides rejected the writings of the other as merely human fabrication that was not worthy of deeper meanings. Arnobius appositely describes this deadlock in the passage quoted at the begin ning of this article: "You say that these were written by humans; we say that those were written by humans—set forth in mortal speech."80 VIII. Reciprocity and Goodwill In the face of these mutual attacks, some writers such as Origen, Julian, and Augustine are capable of making a parallel between pagan readings (either of Homer or Vergil) and Christian readings (of the Scriptures). Origen and Julian both require reciprocity in interpreting sacred texts, pagan and Christian alike. 75 For the circularity of this reasoning, see also McCartney (above, n.19) 292. 76 Orig. Cels. 4.71; see also 1.18. McCartney (above, n.19) 287; Harl (above, n.9) 357-58. 77 Orig. Cels. 1.17-18; 1.20; see also 4.49. McCartney (above, n.19) 283, 286, 292; see also G. G.

Then Origen turns to speak of the gospels and recommends that their readers need goodwill (or kindness, or politeness, eugnomosyne) in their approach. This eugnomosyne is openness or goodwill towards the text. Thus, Origen requires the same openness and goodwill from Greek readers towards the Christian writings that they show towards Greek myths.81 In an other passage Origen asks whether the Greeks alone have the license to interpret myths figuratively while the door of such explanations is closed against Christians.82 A comparable demand for reciprocity comes from Julian in Against Galileans. Julian refers to the tower of Babel and exclaims: "And then you [Christians] insist that we [Hellenes] should believe this [story] while you yourselves refuse to believe in Homer's ac count of the Aloi'dae (Od. 11.316),83 namely that they planned to set three mountains one on another . . ." Then, Julian admits that "for my part, I say that this story is as fabulous as the other." However, Julian asks why Christians discredit Homer's myth if they accept the story about Babel.84 In another passage Julian admits that the Greek myths are "incredible and monstrous." When comparing Greek and Jewish-Christian myths, he remarks that "this is wholly fabulous." Then, he asks how the Jewish tales and the Greek myths differ from each other. After a while he continues, stating that "unless each of these stories is a myth with a secret interpretation, as I believe, they are full of blasphemies about God."85 Julian seems to imply that the stories of both traditions are to be interpreted allegorically. In De utilitate credendi, Augustine assures his readers that what ever there is in the Scriptures, it is lofty and divine and altogether truth. The reader just needs to approach with devotion and piety as true religion demands (devote ac pie, ut vera religio poscit). Augustine advises readers to take the correct attitude towards the Scriptures and the uncouth style of the writers. He notes that the reader must not hate the authors themselves. The reader should love them.86 To illus trate this affection, Augustine takes Vergil as an example. If a reader 81 Orig. Cels. 1.42.

Thus, Augustine compares the interpretation of Vergil with the reading of the Scrip tures.87 He asserts that the readers of the Scriptures should show a similar goodwill, benevolence (ut similem benevolentiam praeberemus eis) towards them as the Roman readers of Vergil show towards Vergil. The old tradition confirms that the Holy Spirit has spoken through the authors of the biblical writings: "Still we youths of brilliant in telligence and wonderful researchers of reason," Augustine exclaims with irony, "have not even opened these Scriptures, have not looked for teachers [to explain the Scriptures], have not even reproached our own dullness, and finally, have not even conceded an average understanding to the writers of the Scriptures." Augustine implies how much more appropriate it was to show benevolentia to the Scriptures than to Vergil. Instead, Augustine complains, Christian readers have been stirred to despise the Scriptures and to cherish pagan fables by those persons who are hostile to the Christian Scriptures.88 Now, the benevolentia advocated by Augustine has something similar to the eugnomosyne promoted by Origen. This reminds us of the goodwill (das Gute Wille) that H. G. Gadamer speaks about. In understanding the other, goodwill is required.89 This is the furthest point towards the textual tradition of the other that was reached in the debates between Christian and pagan writers. Despite the demand for reciprocity, Augustine and Origen as well as Julian declare the superiority of their own traditions. IX. Sacred Texts and the Power of Interpretation To value a text as worthy of allegorical interpretation is to grant it dignity, prestige, and importance. We have seen that one's own myths were regarded as suitable for allegorical interpretation while the other's sacred tales were not.90 The other's myths were interpreted in a literal sense and ridiculed, whereas one's own tales were made ethically and philosophically acceptable by allegories. The very same Porphyry who criticized Christians for making allegorical interpretations 87 Aug. util. cred. 6.13. Here Augustine probably refers to the contemporary al legorical interpretation of Vergil. Schaublin (above, n.86) 58. Courcelle (above, n.14) 118-19, 122, and P. Hadot, Marius Victorinus: Recherches sur sa vie et ses oeuvres (Paris 1971) 215-17, surmised that the fourth-century Roman philosopher Marius Victorinus was one of those who read Vergil allegorically. 88 Aug. util. cred. 6.13. I am inclined to see this as an allusion to Porphyry and his kind. Similarly, Schaublin (above, n.86) 61-63 and C. Schaublin ("Zur paganen Pragung der christlichen Exegese," in J. van Oort and U. Wickert, eds., Christliche Exegese zwischen Nicaea und Chalcedon [Kampen 1992] 161) connect Augustine's discussion to Neoplatonists. 89 H.-G. Gadamer, "Text und Interpretation," in H.-G. Gadamer, Text und Inter pretation (Miinchen 1984), repr. Gesammelte Werke 2 (Tubingen 1993) 343: Beide haben den guten Willen, einander zu verstehen, so liegt iiberall, wo Verstandigung gesucht wird, guter Wille vor ("Both have the good will to understand each other; thus, everywhere where understanding is searched for there is good will" [My emphasis]). 90 See J. Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor (Novato, Calif., 2001) 111: "My favorite definition of mythology: other people's religion."</page><page sequence="19">pagan-Christian Debates in late Antiquity 543 was prone to do the same with the Homeric texts. Porphyry did not object to allegory as such, nor did he object to the Hebrew wisdom as long as it was in the service of Neoplatonic universalism.91 As Gillian Clark puts it, for Porphyry, the Jewish-Christian writings were the wrong kinds of texts for allegorical interpretation because Christians put forward their sacred texts, "not in support of Greek philosophical tradition but in deliberate rivalry" to Neoplatonists.92 Correspondingly, the same could be said, mutatis mutandis, about Augustine's attitude towards the allegories of his rivals, for example. The debates over allegorical interpretation were connected with the struggle over the status of sacred texts and their correct under standing. The contest on the level of texts was also the contest of interpretations between interpretive communities.93 The struggle is apparent, for instance, in Julian's School Edict in which the emperor forbids Christian teachers from expounding on Greek literature, refer ring particularly to Homer and Hesiod. While borrowing and adopting from each other, the interpreters and exegetes, Christian, Jew, and pagan alike, aimed at challenging rival interpretations and refining their own. The dispute on allegories and interpretation coincides with the "rise of the text." This period saw an increase in the collection of sacred texts. Not only Christians, but also Jews (the Mishnah, redacted ca. 200) and pagans (e.g., the Chaldean oracles and Hermetic texts) engaged in this process of forming canons of scripture.94 This period also saw the growth of the quaestiones et responsiones /problemata kai lyseis literature in which Christian and pagan exegetes alike strove to clarify ambiguous passages in their sacred literature.95 91 R. M. Berchman, "In the Shadow of Origen: Porphyry and the Patristic Origins of New Testament Criticism," in G. Dorival and A. Le Boulluec, eds., Origeniana Sexta. Origene et la Bible (Leuven 1995) 660. For Porphyry on the wisdom of the Hebrews, see Eus. praep. 9.10.1-5 and Aug. civ. 19.23. 92 E.g., G. Clark ("Translate into Greek: Porphyry of Tyre on the New Barbarians," in R. Miles, ed., Constructing Identities in Late Antiquity [London 1999] 128) draws attention to Porphyry's inconsistency in attacking the Christian allegorical interpretation. 93 For interpretative communities, see S. Fish, Is There a Text in This Class? The Authority of Interpretive Communities (Cambridge, Mass., 1980). 94 G. G. Stroumsa (The End of Sacrifice: Religious Transformation in Late Antiquity, tr. S. Emanuel [Chicago 2009] 47-50) connects the formation of the Mishnah and the New Testament and even the Chaldaean Oracles. F. Young ("Books and their 'Aura': The Functions of Written Texts in Judaism, Paganism and Christianity during the First Centuries C.E.," in J. Frishman, W. Otten, and G. Rouwhorst, eds., Religious Identity and the Problem of Historical Foundation: The Foundational Character of Authorita tive Sources in the History of Christianity and Judaism [Leiden 2004] 552) speaks of Scripture as becoming a kind of icon—an image mediating reality and divine truth. E. Meltzer ("Old Coptic Texts of Ritual Power," in M. Meyer and R. Smith, eds., Ancient Christian Magic: Coptic Texts of Ritual Power [Princeton 1999] 16) points out that the act of writing and the written text or words also constituted ritual power; e.g., in the use of psalms and Homeric verses in ritual spells and the consultation of books as instant oracles (see P. W. van der Horst, "Sortes: Sacred Books as Instant Oracles in Late Antiquity," in Rutgers, van der Horst, Havelaar, and Teugels [above, n.14] 143-73). 95 For the genre, see C. Jacob, "Questions sur les questions: Archeologie d'une pratique intellectuelle et d'une forme discursive," in A. Volgers and C. Zamagni, eds., Erotapokri seis: Early Christian Question-and-Answer Literature in Context (Leuven 2004) 48-49.</page><page sequence="20">544 Maijastina Kahlos Within this process, Homer, Vergil, and biblical texts were elevated to the position of foundational or divinely inspired and infallible texts.96 Neoplatonists promoted Homer from the status of a poet to that of a prophet and theologian (theologos).97 Plato was also increas ingly regarded as an authoritative "theologian" whose texts were read as revealing eternal truths.98 The same process elevated Vergil to a vates and pontifex maximus—visionary and high priest. Both had access to the secrets of the universe and the divine sphere.99 Sabine MacCormack has remarked that in fact Macrobius' Saturnalia and Augustine's De doctrina Christiana have much in common in their equal concern to explain their sacred texts—either Vergil or biblical texts respectively—as universal and coherent entities. Christian intel lectuals such as Augustine "assigned to history, geography . . . and other fields of knowledge that had long been mobilized to expound Vergil and other pagan texts their place in the exegesis of Scripture." They transferred the model of expounding more or less sacred texts to the biblical texts.100 X. Conclusion In the fifth book of Adversus nationes, Arnobius sets out to ponder the criteria for allegorical reading. He addresses his pagan opponents, pointing out that some parts of their stories are to be understood by all while other parts have a double meaning and are veiled in ambiguity. How is a reader able to distinguish which parts should be read allegorically and which literally? What is the criterion 96 For similarities and differences in the Late Antique exegesis of Homer and the Rabbinic exegesis of the Torah, see P. S. Alexander, " 'Homer the Prophet of All' and 'Moses our Teacher': Late Antique Exegesis of the Homeric Epics and of the Torah of Moses," in Rutgers, van der Horst, Havelaar, and Teugels (above, n.14) 127-42. 97 Homeric texts were read as keys to understanding the cosmic structures and the relationship of body and soul; see, e.g., Lamberton (above, n.9) 10. For instance, Macr. somn. 2.10.11 honored Homer as "the fount and origin of all inventions con cerning the divine" who "delivered this truth to the understanding of the wise beneath a cloud of poetic fiction." 98 Especially in the Neoplatonic School of Athens, Plato was studied as a "sacred text." For Proclus' commentary on Plato's Parmenides, see Brisson (above, n.4) 88-90. 99 Vergil: pontifex maximus in Macr. Sat. 1.24.16. For the flourishing of allegori cal interpretations of Vergil, see Ziolkovski and Putnam (above, n.39) xxxiv-xxxv. In the fifth and sixth centuries, Vergil's Aeneid was interpreted allegorically by Christian exegetes such as Fulgentius (sixth century). Especially Vergil's Fourth Eclogue was allegorized as a prophecy of Christ's coming; see, e.g., den Boeft (above, n.14) 176; Ziolkovski and Putnam (above, n.39) 491-96. 100 MacCormack (above, n.39) 63, 83. MacCormack (73) states that both Mac robius' Saturnalia and Augustine's De doctrina Christiana "focus on a single body of writing that is viewed, for all its diversity, as coherent and ... as universal." Vergil was a revered and respected authority, not only in the cultural area, but also in limited senses in the religious area, even though it would be an exaggeration to see his works as the Bible of the pagans as has sometimes been done; for surveys of the discussion on Vergil's authority, see R. P. H. Green, "Birth and Transfiguration: Some Gospel Episodes in Juvencus and Sedulius," in J. H. D. Scourfield, ed., Texts and Culture in Late Antiquity: Inheritance, Authority, and Change (Swansea 2007) 16, and Cameron, Last Pagans (above, n.52), 588-89, 608-609.</page><page sequence="21">Pagan-Christian Debates in Late Antiquity 545 or sign—Arnobius calls it signum—that guides the reading? What is the interpretative key? Arnobius states that pagans choose some things that suit their purpose. Discussing Arnobius' critique, Jean Pepin remarks that Arnobius was not capable of seeing that Christian allegorists faced the same problem because he himself was not an exegete of the biblical texts.101 Perplexed by the inconsistencies of allegorical reading, Arnobius exclaims, "We confess that we do not understand at all by whom this [allegorical reading] is either done or can be believed to be possible.'"02 A modern reader may share Arnobius' embarrassment (however rhetorical Arnobius' confusion is meant to be) in the face of the inconsistencies of Late Antique allegorical interpretation. Christian, Jewish, Greek, and Roman intellectuals employed similar interpreta tive methods and agreed on their use. Origen's textual approach, for instance, was not very far removed from that of his opponent, Celsus: he interpreted the Jewish-Christian writings in much the same way that Platonists interpreted Homer. The disagreement arose on the assessment of the sacred texts. One's own myths and sacred texts were worthy of allegorical readings whereas those of other groups were not. This fundamental misgiving toward the other's writings was reinforced with arguments of interpretative criteria such as the absurdity of the literal level. Christian allegorical interpretation is to be placed in the context of historical and contemporary pagan allegorical interpretation. The Christian interpretative tradition developed in constant dialogue and debate with Jewish and pagan interpreters, in reaction and in accom modation, in defense and in assault. Allegorical readings, whether they were opposed or accepted, and whether they were abundantly composed or restricted, were part of this complex hermeneutical en vironment in which Greco-Roman, Jewish, and Christian intellectual traditions flourished.
