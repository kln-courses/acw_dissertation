<plain_text><page sequence="1">The entrance facade (south side) of the dragon-house on the summit of Mt. Oche. The Dragon- Houses of Southern Euboia By JEAN D. CARPENTER AND DAN BOYD If nestle Greece the ancient throughout could silent only speak, the stone mountainsides structures they might that tell of nestle throughout the mountainsides of Greece could only speak, they might tell the tales of their history. The origins and significance of several unique buildings in southern Euboia, however, have not been fully revealed, and local inhabitants have relied upon their imaginations for answers to these baffling puzzles. The modern shepherds who roam the hilly slopes surrounding the ancient ruins tell how the singular structures came to be through the invention of mythological creatures. As the story goes, there was once a dragon JEAN D. CARPENTER has an M.A. in archaeology from the University of Cincinnati and is an archaeological artist. She has participated in numerous excavations in Greece and Turkey. The drawings illustrating this article are her work. DAN BOYD holds a M.Phil, in classical archaeology from Yale University and currently attends the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill University in Montreal. who lived in a secluded house on the top of Mt. Oche, one of the highest peaks in Euboia. Every night he rode horseback to meet with his lover in the coastal village of Rouklia. Once in town, the dragon gave his horse enough barley-feed to last only until just before dawn. This way he knew that when his horse was finished eating it was time to leave. The woman, however, who was not really in love with the dragon, was anxiously searching for a way to escape his visits. One day she asked if there were anything which frightened him. Unsuspectingly he replied, "I fear nothing except your brother's dog." Upon hearing that, she told her brother to bring his dog secretly from the sheepfold early the next morning. Then she cunningly added sand to the horse's feed to insure that the dragon would still be at her home when her brother arrived. The trick worked, and at dawn the dragon was surprised from his slumber by the ferocious animal. The dog chased the dragon up the slopes of Oche and 250</page><page sequence="2">Distribution of the buildings illustrated and discussed in this article. The Cyclades and Dodecanese form a chain across the Aegean between Euboia and Karia. through an underground passage to the peak where the terrified creature sought refuge in his mountaintop home. But the dog remained undaunted and burst inside. In terror the dragon leaped through the roof, leaving a gap still visible to this day, but the persistent dog grabbed him from behind. The dragon shrieked for help from his sister who hastened to his side, only to arrive too late. She mournfully buried her brother on Mt. Oche and placed two gigantic stones over his grave. According to the villagers, these stones, along with the dog's paw-prints and marks from the dragon's feet and knees, can still be seen on the mountainside. Local legends tell of other dragons who lived at nearby Styra and Platanistos. After men fashioned rifles and ceased to use the bow and arrow, they hunted and killed the dragon of Platanistos. The myths do not recount the fate of the dragon of Styra, but the remains of his "house" are well-known by the local shepherds, who have made use of it for centuries. These legendary "dragons" or drakoi were envisioned as semi-anthropomorphic creatures of superhuman strength. Curious shepherds and farmers must have thought that only giants or mythological beings could have managed the massive stones of the ancient buildings which they encountered in several places in southern Euboia. No historical records exist for these mysterious structures. Made of heavy masonry, they came to be called dragon-Houses or drakospita. The study of these "houses," if indeed any human or superhuman ever dwelt within their walls, was first inspired by their legendary origins. Serious inquiry came about by close examination of the structures themselves - their thick walls which hugged the mountainsides and their corbelled roofs of heavy stone. Four years ago, we undertook an architectural comparison of the dragon-houses of southern Euboia, "excavating" them in a sense, without putting a shovel to the earth. After making the formidable climb to inspect their walls and construction, we feel that we may make some preliminary observations about the date, possible function, and builders of these isolated remains. The mountainous area where the structures are found is rich in marble and stone, providing the first clue as to when the buildings were made and who may have built them. During the Late Hellenistic and Roman periods, when Greece had become part of the Roman empire, marble quarries dotted the hills of southern Euboia. With the development of this rich resource came the migration of foreign workers and slaves, who toiled to send marble to all parts of the empire. Historical records relate that a considerable number of foreign laborers were employed, for example, at the ancient quarries on Mt. Hymettos just east of Athens and at Karystos near Styra in Euboia. These workers may well have been the builders of the dragon-houses, all of which were in the close proximity of the marble quarries. The foreigners may have brought with them their architectural traditions and distinctive customs which are reflected in the plan and construction of the dragon-houses. Our search for the closest parallels to these structures ended, in fact, with the discovery of similar buildings in Karia, the homeland of many of the stoneworkers. The final questions, the function of these dry-stone masonry structures, is puzzling. Were the buildings domestic in nature or did they have a more special use? A closer inspection of each of the mysterious Euboian structures may help solve these and other riddles. 251</page><page sequence="3">The Roman columns at Kylindroi. Below is the Castle Rosso in the plain of Karystos. The corbelled roofs and large stone masonry of the dragon-houses caused mid-nineteenth-century travelers, for want of a better explanation, to liken them to Mycenaean cyclopean structures, such as the "beehive" tholos tombs and the galleries of Mycenae and Tiryns. Although none of these dragon-houses are part of any tour itineraries, the four known examples can be visited in their picturesque settings. The most impressive one is known alternately as the Temple of Hera or the Oche dragon-house and is situated on the highest peak of Mt. Oche above the town of Karystos. Three others can be found on the lower slopes of Mt. Kliosi near the inland town of Styra. They form a single complex, grouped around a courtyard. Most of these structures are rectangular in plan with a single door in one of the long sides and a smoke hole in the roof. The dragon-house on Mt. Oche can be reached by way of My loi, a small village about three-and-a-half hours below the summit. One of the last buildings in Myloi is a flat-roofed chapel, called the Aghioi Theodoroi , above which the path divides. To the right on a shelf are makrona or kylindroi, Roman marble columns lying at an altitude of approximately 650 meters. Here ten or more finished and half-finished monolithic columns were abandoned in their quarry below the Oche dragon-house. They lie on two levels, the lower five perching on a rather steep slope and balancing precariously on the side of the mountain. One measures 11.80 meters in length and approximately 1.47 meters in diameter. The weight of the largest is estimated at forty tons. Two smaller columns and one which is only half cut from the rock are included in the upper level. The area around these columns is so limited, and the slope is so steep that it is difficult to imagine a reasonable means of transporting the monoliths to the coast. No sledge marks, indentations made by the wooden runners of the sleds that bore the heavy marble, were visible. One wonders whether the abandonment of these monolithic kylindroi followed the realization that they could not easily be transported. 252</page><page sequence="4">An impressionistic sketch of the route to the dragon-house on the summit of Mt. Oche. The chapel of Prophet Elias, the dragon- house itself, and the kataphygion or a modern shelter are hidden behind Oche s nearer peak. The second peak is not visible during the first part of the climb. A view from behind and above the dragon-house on Mt. Oche, showing the roof and the gap "which the dragon made." Clouds can be seen passing below. We delayed our ascent for three days in late April before the mountain peak became clear. The imposing peak above this quarry, second only in height to Mt. Dirphys, is reached by a winding steep path. Once on the summit, one first encounters the modern chapel of the prophet Elias and its subsidiary buildings. The roofs of these structures copy the ancient style and are corbelled like that of the dragon-house above, but are made less skillfully and with smaller stones. The dragon-house itself, sheltered in a cleft of the peak, is nearly invisible, blending in with the natural rocks of the summit. Protected by a modern wall at the north, this elaborate and well-constructed building has a rectangular plan measuring 12.70 by 7.63 meters. Stone walls, with a double thickness averaging 1.40 meters in width, support a corbelled roof of heavy slabs. Corbelling, a technique for roofing stone chambers, is accomplished by placing each course of stone partially overhanging the one below. The stones eventually meet, and the effect is that of a low pitched roof. The gap at the top of the Oche building was most likely bridged with a flat ridge of cover slabs called 253</page><page sequence="5">Location of the three dragon-houses near Styra. The south path follows ancient sledge-trails. Sledge-trail used for the transport of marble quarried above Styra near the three dragon-houses. capstones. Slabs cut to accommodate a round smoke-hole in the roof now lie inside. There is a space over the lintel of the door and, above that, a large slab which projects outward over the doorway. Two slit windows, which become slighdy more narrow toward the exterior, pierce the thick walls on either side of the door. Paving slabs, upturned and pulled out of position, can be seen inside. Refinements in the masonry of the Oche dragon-house include small channels on the door frame, decorative drafted edges on stones of the exterior, corner bonding of the alternate courses, anathyrosis (the smoothing of stones where they meet to insure a tight fit), some partial smoothing in the interior, and a rounded moulding on the interior face of the door lintel. The effort that was expended to build a structure of such heavy masonry and the attention given to details indicate that the building was intended for more than domestic purposes. The suggestion that it may have been used as a guard or watchpost is contradicted by nature itself. The clouds that so often shroud the peak would render such a function impossible. Perhaps the building's popular appellation, the "Temple of Hera," more correctly suggests its original use. Although certainly not typical Greek temple architecture, the structure may have served religious purposes. N.K. Moutsopoulos, University of Thessalonika, carried out soundings both inside and outside the Oche dragon-house in 1959. The finds, which include a cache of miniature or ritual cups, bones, ashes, and lamps, support the case for the building's use as some sort of sanctuary. ^Cie dragon-houses near Styra on Mt. Kliosi are less difficult to reach than the Oche structure. Two routes lead from the town to the complex. The northern path is longer, and the more direct southern route follows, for much of its way, the sledge-trail used for the transportation of the stone from the nearby quarries. The conspicuous marks of the sledge, which measure approximately 1.3 meters apart, are deeply worn. After a laborious climb up the lower slope of Mt. Kliosi, one can see the impressive quarries spanning the eastern, southern and the western hillsides of a small upland valley. The sledge marks continue up the path; rejected and abandoned blocks and columns can be found scattered here and there. Scholars estimate that during Roman times when the Karystian marble found here became popular, 150,000 cubic meters of stone were removed from the quarries of southern Euboia alone. Probably half of that quantity came from Styra. The greater part of 254</page><page sequence="6">A tentative restoration of the dragon-house complex at Styra. We have shown the north house (to the left) with a central ridge and smoke-holes similar to the ones found in buildings at Oche and Theangela. The south house is restored with a roof terrace easily accessible from the high ground to the east. The corbelled part of the structure underlies the stone roof. The rock basins seen at the back of this structure and in the rock face behind the buildings are damaged, but they can be seen today on the site. the quarried Styrian stone was shipped to Roman Italy, but some of it can still be found in the salvaged columns of the modern Church of the Presentation of the Mother of God in the town square of Styra. Traces of an ancient path leading from the small plain where the quarries were located up to the dragon-house complex can be discerned on the slope directly below the ruins. Once in the dragon-houses, there can be absolutely no doubt about the modern use of the buildings: they are surrounded, scattered, and partially filled with sheep dung. The rectangular buildings to the north and south face each other across a steeply sloping courtyard and have nearly the same dimensions as the Oche dragon-house. The roofs are also similarly constructed, but are less refined. Large stones placed at the edges of the roofs may have served as weights to balance the lower corbelled courses. They may also have been used to retain an earth or pebble fill to provide a level roof terrace easily accessible from the higher ground to the east, such as the one on the south building in the restoration drawing. The bonding of the exterior corners of the building give a "log-cabin" effect like that of the Oche structure. Overhanging projections extend over the doorways of the north and south buildin'gs. The now deeply-buried original floors were probably made partly of natural bedrock and partly of stone paving. The east building, nearly square in plan, is set above the other structures and dominates the courtyard. Its masonry is slightly more carefully worked than the north and south buildings. The exterior of its roof, now hidden by modern repairs and additions, is corbelled in five courses cut to form 255</page><page sequence="7">The corbelled interior of a structure at Alâzeytin in the Bodrum Peninsula. concentric circles. In antiquity, the roof was probably only corbelled with three courses. Although the north and south houses of the Styra complex could have been barracks and storerooms for the quarrymen employed in the adjacent quarries, the quality and distinctive features of the east house may indicate that it was reserved for a more special ritual purpose. The quarrymen, tired after a long workday, may have departed to their sturdy refuge to rest and dutifully perform religious ceremonies. "Hie slaves and laborers at Oche and Styra had counterparts in other areas of Greece. The dragon-houses of Euboia can be compared to at least one similar structure at Mt. Hymettos, which may also have been built by quarrymen. It can be found just east of Athens on the slopes of Mt. Hymettos. The small round structure, which is constructed of extremely large stone slabs, has a corbelled roof and, like the buildings at Oche and Styra, is situated among ancient marble quarries and sledge-trails. Because it is constructed of the locally-quarriéd stone and set into the slope, it is difficult to see from below. However, once at the quarry site, one can look down and see the small structure located about two-thirds the way up the slope. An ancient roadway leads from the building down the slope to the southwest. The building is approximately round with an exterior diameter of 4.5-4.8 meters and interior diameter of 3.5-4.0 meters; the interior height ranges from one meter to 2.56 meters at the center. A low wall formed by the bedrock of the slope bounds the building on the east, where water sometimes seeps through a natural cleft. A rubble wall encloses the rest of the structure. It has a corbelled roof formed of three to four irregular courses of large slabs which leave a small opening for light and ventilation. The capping stone measures 2 by 1.15 by .30 meters. Now partially blocked by shrubbery and rubble, the original doorway on the southern facade of the structure has cuttings for receiving a door frame and bolting a door. Two small cubical stone "tables," one with a shallow circular cutting on its upper surface, are inside the building. The names of the early visitors Fáuvell (1789) and Milchhöfer (1880) are carved on a stone to the northeast on the third course down, but are almost obliterated by the more recent black-marker graffiti. Visitors must wonder why such a small cramped building was constructed of such unnecessarily large and unwieldy slabs of stone. Could the Hymettos building, so similar in construction to the Euboian dragon-houses, 256</page><page sequence="8">be more than a storeroom? In view of its close association with the living rock of the hillside lending a cave-like atmosphere, it is possible that it may have been used as a small shrine. The quarrymen at Hymettos, like those at Euboia, may have built familiar structures on foreign soil in order to achieve some sense of home and belonging. ^Jtrong parallels to the dragon-houses in Greece can be found in Asia Minor, the homeland of many of the laborers and slaves, and were first noted by the late F.P. Johnson. They are found on the Halikarnassos Peninsula of Karia. The examples closest to the dragon-houses include a structure at Theangela, an hour's climb up the pine-clad mountain behind the village of Etrim, and a building at nearby Alâzeytin. The latter location is an abandoned town of the Lelegian people, an ancient Aegean people about whom little is known. Like the Oche and Styra buildings, these two are constructed of heavy dry-stone masonry and have corbelled roofs. Similar structures are common throughout the Halikarnassos Peninsula, and the local architectural style has recently been studied by Wolfgang Radt of the German Archaeological Institute in Istanbul. These Karo-Lelegian buildings are usually sited on sloping ground and are sometimes found in complexes similar in layout to the one at Styra. The rectangular buildings almost invariably have their entrance near the center of one long side. Second floors and roof terraces can also be deduced from remains of stairways and partial remains of the second story. Overhanging projections above the doors are common. The building at Theangela has a smoke-hole similar to that of the Oche dragon-house. These features characterize a local architectural style which survived in the Halikarnassos Peninsula over a long period, stretching from late Archaic, dating at least back to the sixth century b.c., into Roman times. The specific characteristics of the structures in Karia and in southern Euboia, their location, plan, masonry, roofing and architectural details, all point to the fact that related peoples may have built them. The visual proof is, we feel, fairly convincing. Excavations may bear out the comparisons. In any case, further study and investigation is necessary to unlock the secret of these stone structures. For now, the shepherds gazing up at the mountainous panorama before them still tell the tale of the dragon who fled skyward through the roof of his dwelling. For Further Reading on Greek folklore: N.
