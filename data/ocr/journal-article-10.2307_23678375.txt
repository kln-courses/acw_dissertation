<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Validity Problem in Hebrew Law BY OTTO BONDY, SYDNEY I. Jewish Law, a Universal System of Rules The philosophical évaluation of Jewish Law brings to light features of such extraordinary and far reaching importance that it must be regarded as a matter of regret that such évaluation has not been made more often for the benefit of legal philosophy1. Of the usual legal classifications only the distinction between written and unwritten (oral) law is known to ancient Hebrew lawyers; since the oral law or Halakha had been reduced to writing by the 6a Century A. D. this distinction is more of a historical than systematical interest. Other distinctions so essential to jurisprudential discourse, such as the one between law and ethics, between legal norms and those of étiquette or religion, are completely absent in Jewish Law. The same applies to the distinction between positive and natural law. Goldin2 opens his book Hebrew Criminal Law and Procédure with the Statement that the Hebrew language has no équivalent for the terms crime and criminal law. Instead the Biblical literature contains only phrases corresponding to s.in and transgression. Indeed law and ethics as well as religious precepts are ail referred to as "The Law". To this belong also all other "laws". Cohn3 points out that Jewish tradition sees every aspect of human and natural life governed by 'law' and does not recognize any conceptual distinction between laws governing human relations inter se and laws governing the relations between God and His universe or His créatures. The law of physics and biology are laws no less than those regulating human behaviour,- and the laws of property and obligation are laws no différent from those prescribing rules of hygiene or ritual. The law is a manifestation of God just as nature and man himself are; and the fact that any law is called by that name, and is binding, pre-supposes the Divine Will behind it. 1 See ].

Morality and nature emerge out of the One, together they are the law of the One God4. Hebrew Law is Divine Law because of its Divine origin, not because of any specific contents. The law created (given) by God on Mount Sinai is the positive law of the Jewish people and because of this there can not be any differentiation between Divine Law and positive law or any natural law. Because of its divine origin Jewish positive law is also regarded as just, however, it has not been regarded as immutable. True enough, the written law of the Toiah (Pentateuch) was con sidered as incapable of being changed in accordance with the injunction of the Bible in Deuteronomy 4/2 and 8; but changed circumstances could, and did lead to différent interprétations of the given text. Authority for this was founded on Deuteronomy 17/8 and 9, giving preference to the opinion of présent day experts as against older pré cédents,- even inteipxetatio contia legem did occur6. The Oral Law (Halakha), however, though also based on the révélation on Mount Sinai, is considered changeable, though obviously only by changes in what was considered to be the true wording of the law and its correct interprétation as handed down (orally) from génération to génération. The majority rule traditionally deduced from Exodus 23/2: "Thou shall not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgement", therefore: thou shalt follow the multitude and abide by them when the purpose is good and not evil, was an accepted method of altération of the law. The reason why such change was possible in spite of the fact that the divine origin of the law would piima fade imply its immutability, is strikingly revealed by an ancient legend according to which the majority rule even prevails against divine révélation to the contrary: "The Law is not in Heaven: the Law has been handed down to us on earth from Mount Sinai, and we do no longer take notice of Heavenly voices, for the Law which we were handed down, provides that décisions shall be taken by majority6." Indeed, in the light of this interprétation of the majority rule, the Hebrew law is divine law in a very différent sense from that in which 4 L.

See also Stone, op. cit. 27.</page><page sequence="3">The Validity Pioblem in Hebiew Law 219 divine law is generally conceived: It is positive law, only instituted by a divine act of law-giving, and once instituted, it is developed in the same or similar way as positive law is developed anywhere eise in the world. It is by no means free to anybody to contend that he experienced a divine révélation and therefore is compétent to State the contents of such divine law as revealed to him, and to him only. Once a rule of divine law is capable of being repealed, the mere possibility of such a repeal exeludes a "fiction" of immutability of it7. It is indeed its mutability which distinguishes it quite radically from the divinity of the traditional non-Hebrew divine law, as well as from the natural law of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The divine quality of the Hebrew law refers solely to the divine quality of the one and only, its basic act of law création. The non-Hebrew divine law seems to be capable of being revealed to any faithful selected by God to receive the divine message (the infallibility dogma of the Catholic Church seems to allow the interprétation that it is now compétent for the Pope only to make pronouncements of such révélations). Contrary to the traditional non-Hebrew concept of divine law which does not 7 It is submitted that the divinity of the Oral Law was not a mere fiction, as Cohn, supra n. 1, at 55 suggests. It conveys nothing eise than the necessary validity regress which links the rule of the Oral Law with the original act of law-creation. The act of law giving on Mount Sinai thus becomes the "historically first constitution" as referred to in Kelsen's basic norm theory. In a later essay ("Sécularisation of Divine Law" (1966) 16 Scripta Hierosolymitana 55—100), Cohn investigates the development of divine law and natural law in the course of history. Because his approach is historical in this essay, his treatment of the problem of the divine origin of Hebrew law is quite différent from the jurisprudential approach characterising his first essay. In his historical essay, the author shows that the theory of natural law developed from the theory of divine law and he points out the distinction between ius divinum positivum revealed by God in expressis verbis and ius divinum naturale (at 92). He rightly implies that the whole problem of divine law and natural law is one of validity. In the case of divine law, this is based on divine révélation, in that of natural law on reason. The latter would provide only one answer to the problem of legal détermination. In the same issue of the learned journal, I. Englard ("The Relationship between Religion and State in Israel", at 254—275) discusses in a most interesting manner the problems arising from the coexistence of old Jewish law and the law created by the Israeli législature. However, for the présent purposes, the clash between rabbinical and Israeli municipal law is irrelevant.</page><page sequence="4">220 Otto Bondy provide any mechanism for its development and altération and could be understood to rest on "religious experience", the divinity of the Hebrew law imports only the divine origin of the first law giving act by which the Hebrew law was instituted, it imports only the ultimate origin of the Hebrew positive law. Thus the divine quality of the Hebrew law becomes meaningful also to the the non-believerwhomight choose to disregard the typical religious connotations of the traditional terminology: The fewish law then becomes a positive law whose origin goes back to pre-historic times. Consequently, if the Sinaitic law-creation is accepted as a historical fact — then this event becomes what Kelsen calis the historical first constitution beyond which the validity regress of the Hebrew positive law cannot go. The function of the Sinaitic Act of Law-Giving is so firmly established in the Jewish tradition as the ultimate ground of validity of its Law that the validity of all legal material is based on it. This applies not only to the written law traditionally recorded by Moses at the command of God. It applies equally to the Oral Law, the Halakha, handed down from génération to génération by word of mouth which traditionally was also revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai. Even where the law is subjected to change because of changed interprétations, the talmudic tradition still retains the connection with this first act of Law-Giving from which all legal validity is derived. "Whatever a compétent scholar will yet derive from the Law, that was already given to Moses on Mount Sinai8." It is attractive to speculate whether an old Rabbinic legend would indicate that fewish legal tradition was prepared to go even one Step further. Jacobs9 refers to an "oft-repeated Rabbinic teaching that Abraham kept the whole of the Torah before it was given". If the Law revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai is eternally valid, then its valid ity must also extend to the past because eternity has no beginning and no end in time. The Law revealed on Mount Sinai must also have been valid for Abraham and the Law which Abraham observed must also derive their validity from this "historically first constitution", the Sinaitic Act of Law-Giving. Where tradition bases the création of positive law on God's Will it would be reasonable to expect that religious mysticism would be introduced into legal reasoning. However, not only was Jewish legal 8 Jerusalem Megillah, IV, 74 d. See Stone, op. cit. supra n. 1, at 24. 9 L. Jacobs, We have Reason to Believe (3rd ed. 1965) 75.</page><page sequence="5">The Validity Problem in Hebrew Law 221 argument10 completely free from such influence, but on the contrary, legal reasoning found its way into xeligious ritual. When the feast of Passover is celebrated, care must be taken that, in commémoration of the inability of the Jews, when leaving Egypt, to complete the baking of their bread, no leavened bread is left in the house. Though it is imcumbant on the mistress of the house to see to this, it is the duty of the master of the house to make sure of it. He has to institute a search of his house for which a specific ritual is prescribed. Should he find any bread, he is expected to burn it. However, whether or not he was successful in his search, he can never be sure that he did not overloock any bread which escaped his attention. He therefore "annuls" such bread as he might have failed to detect, and declares it to be "dust of the earth11." The words used are the legal formula of the Hebrew law which must be pronounced to waive ownership rights: the derelictio of the Roman law which is the legal act by which a thing becomes res nullius. When discussing the role of the Talmud in the development of Jewish law, Cohn, as stated above12, stresses the point that the Talmud does not only deal with legal questions; it contains in addition the Cohn, supra n. 1, at 53: "If we look, then, at the legislative process under Talmudical Law — the création of Halakha — as a whole, we find, that, although the resulting law is deemed part of the Divine Oral Law, there is nothing divine or superhuman or mystic in the methods employed in making the law." The ritual prescribes that the master of the house, before beginning the search, pronounces the following blessing: "Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with Thy command ments, and commanded us to remove the leaven". After having said the blessing, the master of the house must be careful not to speak until after the conclusion of the search, when securing the pieces of leaven he has collected, he says: "All manner of leaven that is in my possession, that which I have not removed, shall be hereby annulled and accounted as the dust of the earth". [Hagadah shel Pesach). See also Stone, op. cit. supra n. 1, at 24. Another example of legal thinking being incorporated into religious ritual is the inclusion in the synagogical morning service of the legal rules relating to offerings (Numbers 28/9—15) and even of the rules of (legal) interprétation given by Rabbi Ishmael (Authorised Player Book of the United Hebrew Congrégations of the British Empire (1956) 11—14). Among those 13 rules we find the argumentum a minore ad maius (Principie 1), though surprisingly not the argumentum a maiore ad minus, rules regard ing restrictive and extensive interprétation (Principies 4—11), and gram matical interprétation (Principies 2, 12, 13). 12 See supra n. 3. lä ARSP LIV/2</page><page sequence="6">222 Otto Bondy teachings of various periods on the whole range of human intellectual endeavour. This is explained by Cohn by the fact that Jewish tradition comprehends everything occuring in human life as well as in the realm of nature as governed by "law", and does not recognize any conceptual distinction between différent kinds of law. Again: The Divine Will becomes nothing eise than the ultímate ground of validity of the "law" comprising not only all possible rules for human actions, but also those rules which are formulated to explain the "un-willed" re-actions of man, animal or plant, or unanimated matter. Cohn's rendering of the traditional Jewish concept of Law brings to mind the teaching of St. Thomas Aquinas who likewise devises such a system of rules of Divine origin, including in that system not only ail kind of rules regulating the relations of man to man and man to God, but also the Laws of Nature, ail ultimately based on and related to the Will of God in His ordination of the Universe13. Goldin14 points out that Jewish Law distinguishes between manda tory and prohibitory law. Non-performance of a mandatory act ... is solely a violation of a religious duty which only the Law Giver Himself can punish. The transgression of a prohibitory law ... since it entails ... explicit wrong doing, is ... punishable by a human court of justice. Mandatory law seems, according to Goldin, to create duties of com mission, and prohibitory law, duties of omission. Whether or not this distinction was carried out strictly in Jewish law is more a question of legal history which is of no relevance here. It might, however, be con sidered of jurisprudential interest whether the mandatory laws would be considered leges impeifectae creating only obligationes naturales. This question is connected with the problem whether the sanction constitutes an essential element of the law. Kelsen is the most prominent legal scholar who adhères to the Kantian theory that the sanction is an essential element of the law, and that it constitutes the criterion by which the law can be distin guished from all other norms especially those of morality and étiquette. The présent writer has opposed this on semantic grounds15 and 13 St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, la—Ilae, qq. 90-108, esp. 91 and 93 ff. 14 Op. cit. supia n. 1, at 13. 15 O.

Stone 17, quoting Timasheff 18 approvingly, objects against this on sociological grounds. Indeed it appears that law can only be distinguished from other rules by the ultimate ground of validity to which the system's validity regress refers. The Hebrew law seems to indícate that the law can also contain norms which, by their contents, might be characterised as norms of morality and religion. Indeed, the history of Hebrew law seems to demónstrate that the distinction between norms of law, norms of ethics, norms of religion or any other norms is not ontological but only historical. II. furisprudential Interpretation of the Divine Ozigin of the Hebrew Law We have shown so far that the traditional divinity of the Hebrew law refers to its origin rather than to its contents. It is Divine Law because its validity regress ends at the Divine Act of Law-Giving on Mount Sinai from which all legal material derives its validity. For the fundamentalist Jewish theologian there exists no doubt that this original act of law-giving was a historical event which actually took place in the manner described in the Bible. By this the fundamen talist quite unnecessarily invites the criticism of the sceptic. For what is jurisprudentially and, I would venture to think, also theologically all important, is that the Sinaitic Act of Law-Giving was accepted by the Jewish people as being of divine origin and, as laying down the Law for them, and indeed all their rules for human behaviour. Nothing can be gained, theologically or jurisprudentially, by raising the question of the historicity of an event which is the most cherished and sublime of the surprisingly few mystical elements of the Jewish religion. The historian may well assume that the first and original act of law-giving, this "historical first constitution" of the Jewish people is lost in pre-historic times: this does not make any différence whatsoever to its jurispruden tial or theological import. Its jurisprudential significance lies in the fact that it allows to formúlate Kelsen's basic norm in relation to the Hebrew law as: Do as God has commanded on Mount Sinai. 16 E.

Timashefe, An Introduction to the Sociology of Law (1939) 264—65.</page><page sequence="8">224 Otto Bondy The position is here the same as that characterised by Latham when investigating the question whether there is a formal unity of "British Commonwealth Law". For this, Latham19 says, it is not necessary to make the basic norm explicit, "but only to discover whether the mem bers ... share a common Gmndnoim whatever its terms may be." What Latham means to import is that, what is essential to discover, so as to enable us to speak of a "British Commonwealth Law" is, whether the validity regress ends at a point common to all legal Systems of the member nations, in whatever way this point may be determined. This point may not be a historically determinable event. With respect to Hebrew law this point is designated by the Sinaitic Act of Law-Giving, and it is similarily of no jurisprudential conséquence whatsoever whether this point, though traditionally designated by an event be lieved to have actually occurred, can be determined by the historian as one which has actually taken place at a specified time. Indeed, the logical conséquences of the traditional Jewish concept of God might well imply the utter futility of any attempt to interpret the Sinaitic act of law-creation historically. According to the traditional Jewish belief God is not a reality in the philosophical sense. Epstein20 makes the point that it was the tendency to rationalism, discernible already in the Bible, that enabled the teachers of Israel to arrive at a spiritual conception of God notwithstanding the antropomorphisms in which Scriptum abounds ... This spiritualization of the conception of God is reflected already in certain changes known as Tikkune Soferim (Corrections of the Scribes) which, ascribed to Ezra, were introduced into the Biblical text in order to tone down certain anthropomorphic expressions; and it becomes very pronounced in the Aramaic translation of the Bible, the Taigamim in which all anthropomorphisms are avoided. Henee the common use in the Targumim of the term Memia, 'Word', as a reverent circumlocution for God where the literal rendering would make God act in the same manner as man. This antianthropomorphical bias is also characteristic of the Greek translators of the Hebrew scriptures. They likewise sought to spiritualize the conception of God by removing or moderating many of the human qualities or motives attributed to God in the Bible. There is no evidence that these translators were influenced by Greek philos 19 R. T. E. Latham, "The Law and the British Commonwealth" in W. K. Hancock, 1 Survey of British Commonwealth Affaiis (1937) 525. 20 I.

They were mere translators, not philosophers. But they could not help being guided by religious ideas which were already well estab lished in Jewry in their times. Possibily the first expression of such "spiritualization" is the prohi bition contained in the second of the Ten Commandments21 of the making of "any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the waters beneath the earth", namely the portraying of anything which is beyond possible human experience. The narrative of the Bible indicates that it took many centuries for the Jews to accept monotheism and especially the notion of an "invisible" God. But it took as long as the twelfth Century for the classical formulation to be given by Maimonides, a formulation which is now incorporated in the ritual of the orthodox synagogical morning service. The Jewish concept of God is contained in the first four of the "Thirteen Principies of Faith" formulated by Maimonides22. In them God is stated to be "a Unity, ... not a body, ... free from all accidents of matter, and has no form whatsoever." in the light of such formulation it would indeed appear sacrilegious to ascribe "existence" to God23. 21 Exodus 20/4, Deut. 5/8. An interprétation according to which the iniunction against making any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in the heaven above is only an injunction against worshiping idols (Exodus 20/3 and Deut. 5/7): "Thou shalt not have any other gods before me") is obviously too narrow. Such an interprétation could not explain the connection between the injunction against picturing anything which is in heaven with the injunction against picturing anything which is in the earth beneath or in the waters beneath the earth. If only an injunction against worshiping idols had been intended, this would have heen stated clearly with as many words as it was done in Leviticus 19/4: "Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourself molten gods." 22 Authorised Daily Piayei Book cited supra n. 11, at 89. 23 I. Tammelo, "Justice and Doubt" ¡1959) 9 österreichische Zeitschrift für öffentliches Recht 308, at 411: "God that remains hidden in our actual cura is not an irrelevant God to us. Even this God we can approach with our reverence, worship and ultímate longing and leave to Him everything that is beyond our own powers to arrange. In response to this emotion of cura we may expect His grace, by which those things that we cannot achieve in the knowing and realising justice will he given to us. This we may hope if we do not commit the sacrilege of trying to convert God's suhsistence into an existence in our everydayness". Tammelo's concept of God, though stated in a metaphysical context, comes near to the Jewish concept though the latter is entirely free from mysticism and meta</page><page sequence="10">226 Otto Bondy God described as a unity in the classical formulation of Maimonides thus becomes the Symbol or principie of unity of the Jewish law, its ultímate ground of validity. Since to the Jews every aspect of human and natural life is governed by "law", God becomes the ultímate ground of validity of the fews' very Weltanschauung and the Jewish religion not only the basis of, but identical with the Weltbild of the Jews. The concept of a personal God, this fundamental tenet of the Jewish and all Christian religions has recently come under scrutiny24. The development of the Jewish religion, which follows clearly from the narrative of the Bible, was one from polytheism to monotheism (Abraham); from a monotheism which allowed personal contact with God to a monotheism which accepted the one God without any possible experience of His existence; from a monotheism merely prohibiting any picturing of God (second Commandment) to the monotheism of Maimonides which denied God to have any attribute compatible with and necessary for existential reality; from a religion which must have known human sacrifice (sacrifice of Isaac) to a religion which allowed only animal and food sacrifice, and to one which eventually substituted sacrifice by prayer. Such a religion is quite likely to be able to adapt physical cannotation. "As a metaphysical notion 'Cum infinita' does not", Tammelo admits (ibid. 410) "provide definite precepts for social behaviour. But the intimation of the open horizon of our Cognition and conation which it imports may help us to understand better our human situation so that we could be delivered from harmful rigidity in our social attitudes and actions". See also Jacobs, op. cit. supra n. 8, at 14: "The Kabbalists in their eagerness to emphasise God's incomprehensibility go so far as to speak of Hirn as 'Ayin' — He Who is Not — that is to say one cannot, strictly speaking, even say that God exists, for this, too, is an attempted description of that which cannot be described". See also Exodus 3/14, where God's name is given as: I AM THAT I AM. See the interesting survey in the American News Magazine Time of 8th April, 1966, vol. 87, No. 14, at 40 ff. This survey deals mainly with Christian theology and with the Jewish faith only in as far as Christian religious thinking is based on it. However, a prominent Jewish theologian, Mordecai Kaplan, has already advocated in his book The Meaning of God in Modem Jewish Religion (1937) a concept of God which does not conceive of God as a "person" — this is exactly what is now being advocated by some Protestant theologians. According to Kaplan, Godhood can have a meaning for modern man apart from human ideáis (at 25).

Whether it will come to such a development is, of course, mere conjecture; however the mere possibility of such a development quite irrespective of whether or not it is likely ever to take place, might be an indication of the extent to which theological argument may be relevant to the philosophical appraisal of Jewish Law and law in general27. The Jewish Law is clearly positive law only relat ed back to a divine act of law-giving as its ultimate ground of validity, and only in this very restricted sense is the positive law of the Jews divine law; as the ultimate ground of validity the historicity of such "first" law-giving act is jurisprudentially — and it might well be added, philosophically and theologically — of no relevance. 25 Langdon Gilkey of the University of Chicago Divinity School. See article cited supra n. 24 (Time) 40. 26 From the account given by Rabbi Jacob B.Agus in his book The Evolution of Jewish Thought (1959), 197, of the teachings of Maimonides, it would appear that Maimonides might well have considered the feasibility of such an évolution. Referring to the teachings of Maimonides, Agus points out that Moses faced the problem 'of weaning the people away from the worship of pagan deities. In the days of Moses, the people were not yet ready for more elevated forms of worship. . . . Moses' predicament may be compared to the appearance of a prophet in our day who would call to the service of God in the foliowing manner: The Lord commanded you not to pray to Fiim and not to fast and not to seek His help in time of trouble, but to let your service consist in thought only, without deeds". To this, following the quotation from Maimonides, Agus comments: "Such a message would be in keeping with the inner truth of faith, but it would hardly be accepted by the people of our day". Of course, service "with thought only, without deeds" is tantamount to méditation. 27 See F. Puy, "Teología del Deiecho" (1964) 4 (1) Anales de la Catedia "Francisco Suarez" 9—49.</page><page sequence="12">228 Otto Bondy III. Hebiew Law in Its Relations to Ethics and Natural Law We started our délibérations with the Statement that the distinction between norms of law, ethics and religion is absent from the argument of Jewish thinkers. The reason for this seems to be of the highest im portance for the proper évaluation of Jewish legal thinking, and juris prudential thinking in general. The présent writer has always taken the view that the law and all other norms can only be distinguished from each other by the source from which they originate28, and this seems to make it logically pos sible that a norm such as the prohibition of killing 29 is included in legal as well as in moral or religious normative Orders. The fact that Jewish tradition failed to make a distinction between legal, ethical and religious precepts and the failure of the Jewish thinkers to evolve a moral and natural law philosophy on Greek lines seems to have a much deeper reason than just lack of philosophical understanding. "The religion of the Greek", say L. R. Faruck and H. J. Rose,30 "developed without any authoritative sacred writing, such as the Bible and the Koran, or any inflexible or unquestionable tradition to hamper or guide it". They describe it as anthropomorphic polytheism charac terised by "an absence of other-worldliness". In their view mysticism representing secret cuits into which the novice was initiated in stages developed independent of, and side by side with Greek religion. Greek religion shares this absence of mysticism with the orthodox Jewish religion which is centred in the God-given Law and is free from any metaphysical spéculation as well as mysticism; the Kabbalah, and more recently, Hassidism, developed outside Jewish orthodoxy. It is signif icant that the origin of the Kabbalah "may be traced to sayings and beliefs known to have existed among gnostics and followers of Pythagoras". The absence of any authoritative sacred writing in Greek religion telling man what to do, gives it merely the character of explaining certain natural and social facts and fails completely in the task assumed by Jewish monotheism of giving to man strict rules according to which See articles cited supia n. 14. With certain modifications: Killing of the enemy is allowed in war time, blood vengence and human sacrifice to the Gods in primitive society; killing is lawful as the exécution of death penalty.

The Greek, unable to satisfy this obviously basic need within their religion31 devised moral philosophy as a means to satisfy it. It is therefore not surprising that one of the oldest Greek ethical Systems, that of Pythagoras, takes a form very much akin to religion and has to resort to mysticism in order to establish what to the Jews was the expressed Will of God. However, Greek mysticism was too little connected with traditional Greek religion to gain importance beyond that of local cuits. The Greek mind finding no answer in popular religion to the basic question of morality "What shall I do?" discovers moral philosophy and meta physics in an endeavour to answer it. While the Jewish mind is put at ease by clear-cut divine commandments which by way of interprétation were extended to cover not only every aspect of human life, but also every minute of the Jew's waking day, the Greek mind has to achieve the same feeling of security by a strong belief in the capacity of the human mind to discover the rules of proper conduct with equal certainty as would a belief in the omniscience of Almighty God and His revealed Word. IV. Jewish Theology as Philosophy of Hebrew Law When considering the important role which the 18"1 Century Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn played in the history of the Jewish people, Rabbi Dr. I. Epstein32 reports that Moses Mendelssohn refused to recognize any eternal verities, except those which cannot only be conceived but also be established and verified by human reason. Moses Mendelssohn, Epstein continues, based Judaism on three articles of faith33 which are common to all persuasions; "But whereas other religions have superimposed upon the body of common truths a system of creed and dogmas ..., Judaism, Mendelssohn asserts,... is not 51 See O. Bondy, "The Moral Law Theory: Its Methodological Implications for Moral and Legal Philosophy" in I. Tammelo, A. Blackshield, and E. Campbell (eds.), Australian Studies in Legal Philosophy (1963) (published as Beiheft No. 39 of Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie) 141 ff., where reference is made to the basic fact in moral philosophy which is described as man's eternal quandary in determining his own actions.

It is regrettable that the learned rabbi fails completely to appreciate the grandeur of the all-embracing concept of Law devised by Jewish thinkers which is precisely characterised by its all-embracing wideness and does not require any reference to the highly controversial concept of religious experience invoked by modern theology and philosophy. However, it is worthy of noting that Mendelssohn35 clearly perceived the paramount role which juris prudence would have to play in the interprétation of a religion which is clearly based on the concept of law. It is readily admitted36 that atheism, understood as disbelief in the existence of God, did not exist among Jews in ancient times, and that only under the impact of Greek philosophy did the Jews Start to adduce proofs of God's existence. Indeed, as stated above,37 according to ancient Jewish doctrine "existence" cannot be predicated of God; it was clearly left to the individual how to comprehend an "invisible" and "non-existent" God. What was accepted was the promulgation by God of the Jewish Law in its widest implications namely its divine origin, and any spéculation of the essence of God was strictly speaking the result of "legal" interprétation, namely the interprétation of the Biblical text. Metaphysical spéculation such as are adduced in the traditional three proofs of the existence of God are compatible with the ancient Greek, but completely alien to the ancient Hebrew mind. Atheism would have meant the négation of the validity of the Law which was too generally accepted to allow any doubt to arise. If agnos ticism means the view that nothing can be known of the existence of God or of anything beyond material phenomena, it can be stated, only seemingly paradoxically, that this was virtually taught by ancient Hebrew thinkers: it is inherent in the injunction contained in the second of the Ten Commandments38 which in fact prohibits the portraying of anything which we are incapable of knowing from 34 Op. cit. supia n. 20, at 288. 35 Moses Mendelssohn, Jerusalem (English translation by M.Samuels, 1938). 36 See Jacobs, op. cit. su pía n. 9, at 24. 37 See supra n. 23. 34 See Exodus 20/4, Deut. 5/8.</page><page sequence="15">The Validity Problem in Hebrew Law 231 experience. If it is accepted as a tenet of the Jewish religion that strictly speaking "existence" cannot be predicted of God, then even atheism could be considered as being not incompatible with it, provided, of course, we restrict the meaning of atheism to the mere denial of an existence of God which can be experienced through our senses, and further provided that we conceive of Jewish religion, as Moses Mendels sohn indeed did, as "revealed Law" in its widest possible ramifications, without, however, contrasting it to "revealed religion". By extending their concept of Law to comprise what, with a modern expression, might be termed the ontological and the deontological universe, ancient Hebrew thinkers have shown that jurisprudential Problems have an application beyond their merely juristic import. Especially the problem of validity is one which is shown not to be restricted to the juristic field but to extend to nomology generally, namely to all situations where man may be confronted with the problem of arranging his behaviour in conformity with rules devised by what is termed his own conscience, namely the plan adopted by him self for his own life, or some "source" outside himself, some "authority" or some "intelligence" (reason). Because of the meaningful extension of the concept of law to the laws of nature the problem suggests itself that the question of validity of laws of nature and that of the validity of norms of human behaviour might allow a solution common to ontology and deontology. In the field of jurisprudence, however, the Solution of the problem of legal validity suggested by ancient Hebrew law might also help to throw new light on the problem of natural law, at least as far as its relation to divine law is concerned. OTTO BONDY Das Geltungsproblem im hebräischen Recht Zusammenfassung Dem auf dem alten Testament beruhenden hebräischen Recht sind fast alle von den üblichen juristischen Klassifikationen fremd. Dies ist darin begründet, daß der Begriff des Rechts nicht auf das juristische Gebiet beschränkt wird, sondern alle Normen im weitesten Sinne umfaßt. Das hebräische Recht wird als göttliches Recht angesehen nicht wegen eines bestimmten Inhalts, sondern wegen seines göttlichen Ursprungs. Da nach traditioneller Auslegung die Bibel selbst die Regeln für seine Weiterbildung, das heißt aber Abänderung durch Auslegung, enthält,</page><page sequence="16">232 Otto Bondy fehlt trotz Deut. 4/2 und 8 dem göttlichen Recht der alt-hebräischen Tradition die Eigenschaft der Unabänderlichkeit. Es ist positives Recht, teils gesetztes Recht und teils Gewohnheitsrecht, das göttliches Recht ist, weil sein letzter Geltungsgrund auf göttlicher Offenbarung beruht. Weil dieses offenbarte Recht die Grundlage ist, auf welcher die jüdische Religion beruht, wird die Bedeutung der juristischen Argu mentation für die jüdische Religion dargelegt und angedeutet, daß die theologische Argumentation auch für die Rechtsphilosophie fruchtbrin gend ist. Die Theologie der jüdischen Religion wird als Philosophie des hebräischen Rechts angesprochen und der auf griechischer Grundlage beruhenden Rechts- und Moralphilosophie vergleichend gegenüber gestellt. Die sich aus dieser Darstellung ergebenden Schlußfolgerungen werden als eine Ausdehnung des Problemgebietes der Rechtsphilosophie formu liert von der auch eine weitere Klärung des Problems des Naturrechts erhofft werden kann. OTTO BONDY « Le Problème de la Validité du Droit Hébraïque » Le droit hébraïque, basé sur l'Ancient Testament, est complètement différent des tous les autres systèmes du droit, parce que ici la con ception du droit n'est pas limitée au domaine juridique, mais comprend toutes les normes dans le sense le plus large. Le droit hébraïque n'est pas considéré comme divin à cause de son contenu mais à cause de son origine divine. Tandis que selon l'interprétation traditionelle la Bible contient les règles pour développement, c'est à dire le changement par moyen de l'interprétation, il manque (malgré Deut. 4/2 et 8) au droit divin de la tradition hébraïque ancienne la qualité de l'immutabilité. Le droit divin est un droit positif, qui est soit ordonné soit coutumier. Sa validité reste sur une révélation divine. Puisque ce droit révélé constituit la base sur laquelle la religion juive reste, l'argumentation juridique est significante pour la religion juive; de l'autre coté l'argumentation théologique est importante pour la philosophie de droit. La théologie de la religion juive étant aussi la philosophie de droit hébraïque est comparée ici avec l'éthique et avec la philosophie du droit basées sur le fondement grec. Les conclusions de cet article se présentent comme une extension de la sphère des problèmes philosophiques du droit. Leur clarification doit avoir une portée sur l'élucidation du problème du droit naturel.</page></plain_text>
