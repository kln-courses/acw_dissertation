<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEVILLE'S "NATURALISM" AND THE LOCATION OF GOD Robert S. Corrington / Drew University The main concern of this paper will be to come to grips with how Neville envisions the transcendence and immanence of God vis-?-vis the nor mative and formal properties of the world, as they obtain essentially and conditionally. This is directly related to his Schleiermacher-like sense that every determinate thing in the world (and there are no non-determinate things) is absolutely or sheerly dependent on the creator. To be determinate is to be the locus of identity and otherness within a system of infinite reciprocities and negations.1 Primary among the "things" of the world is temporality. To grasp the fullness of the creator it will be necessary to analyze the relationship of ontological mutuality between the flow of time and eternity. At the heart of all of these analyses will be the delineation of the utter centrality, for Neville, of the reality of creatio ex nihilo as the ground principle, or perhaps pre principle, that guarantees the full incarnationality of God as Logos within a world that is fully determinate and closed, yet allows for finite freedom (a position that Neville refers to as neo-Calvinism). This ontological ground creates the world in a unique sense and is held to be the case regardless of the status of the cosmological theory of the Big Bang, or any possible alternative, in astrophysics. That is, ontological creation is different in kind from any event that could be delineated by scientific inquiry, which, by definition, deals with cosmological creation. It might help us to gage the radicality of Neville's concept of ontological creation if we remember that it is similar to the shock of the onto logical difference in Heidegger. That is, there is an abyss of difference between indeterminate being-itself and any being thing that takes on essential and conditional determinate traits. Actually, for Neville there are three terms in the fundamental structure of his system. There is indeterminate being-itself and the opposite extreme of determinate being. Connecting them is the creative act 1 Robert Neville, God the Creator: On the Transcendence and Presence of God (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1968), 49. Reprinted with new Preface by SUNY Press in 1992. 257</page><page sequence="2">258_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ of God that brings determination to the divine precisely in the act of creating the world. The creator makes itself creator when and as it creates; in order to do this, it must be independent, in itself, of the products it creates and even of its own role of being creator. The role of the creator is the nature the creator has in virtue of its connection with the created determinations.2 My own alternative [to the process view] is that God is creator of everything determinate, creator of things actual as well as of things possible. Apart from the relative nature the divinity gives itself as creator in creating the world, God is utterly transcendent.3 God becomes determinate in a relative way, i.e., as relevant to the world, by and through the eternal act of creation. But God as being-itself, that is, as living on the nether side of the ontological difference, is transcendent of any analogy or determinate comparison that could bring God into human purview. The God that we actually encounter in the world is the God that lives as the third term straddling the ontological difference between ind?termination and determination. Put most succinctly, "being-itself is essentially indeterminate and conditionally determinate."4 It should be noted here that the world does not give determination to God, contra the process view, but that God gives itself determination in a strictly relative way so as to remain in eternal relevance to the determinate orders of creation. Neville's God is an extremely large God, if we may use Loomer's language, and cannot be confined in any analogical structure that would bind the divine to finite proportionality.5 There is nothing similar to the consequent nature of God that gains ontological weight with each objectively 2 Ibid., 72. 3 Robert Neville, Creativity and God: A Challenge to Process Theology (New York: Seabury press, 1980), 8.

Nor is God an "as-if ' construct or a neo-pragmatic symbol, but is sheer being-itself transcendent of analogical bridges. Even the God of Aquinas seems rather tame and domestic when placed against Neville's indeterminate ground and abyss. And the process God, especially in its now faded glory, looks like a straight put-up job when projected onto the traitless ground of being-itself. The primordial dimension of God seems too static and determined by internal contrasts, while the con sequent dimension is like an omnivorous cousin that eats one out of house and home. If nothing else can be said, Neville's indeterminate ground cannot get any bigger because of what the world does; it is already and always that than which nothing greater can be conceived. In order to grasp the full richness and scope of Neville's philosophical theology it will be necessary to address several connected themes that cumulatively show us the location of God vis-?-vis his quasi-process under standing of creation or nature. These themes are: the transcendence of God, the presence or immanence of God, the nature of eternity, and the structure of the things of the world. Insofar as Neville considers himself to be a naturalist, and in this we will give him the benefit of the doubt, his conception of nature will be probed to see how it might frame his understanding of God. By way of a proleptic hint of our conclusion, we may find that his God is too big and his nature is too small, and that he wants things from the indeterminate ground, qua self-determining, that simply might not be available. e have noted Neville's extreme version of the ontological difference V Y between Being and a being. However, he prefers to speak of being itself rather than Being by way of emphasizing the utter independence of the primal ground and its position prior to the divide between Being and nonbeing. God transcends the world in the sense that God can not be reached by any conceptual or analogical bridge that starts from any order of creation. As noted above, God or being-itself has no traits and cannot be predicated in any way. For Neville, only the mystic has something like direct access to the indeter minate God. Like Tillich's God beyond the God of theism, Neville's God has no internal contrasts and cannot be in dialogue with itself. This dimension of L</page><page sequence="4">260_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ God, God in essential indifference, has no providential reality. Indeed, Neville marks a distinct departure from so many twentieth century Protestants, for example, Moltmann and Pannenberg, who see the not yet {noch nicht sein) as a fundamental trait of the divine life.6 The indeterminate Ground, hardly unruly for Neville, can only be arrived at by contrast to the determinate things of creation that frilly participate in God, but which are separated from being-itself by an abyss. While Neville is convinced that we can make a series of forceful arguments for the necessity of the ontological one, as a unifying principle that is not part of the many as a kind of super-unity within the world, it does not follow that we can enter into the inner life of the indeterminate God. This position should remind us of the mature Schleiermacher who has been labeled a pietistic agnostic on the God question. For Schleiermacher, of course, the delineation of the features of self-consciousness in its three grades, animal/immediate, middle level, and religious/higher level, gives us indirect access to God through the primacy of the feeling of absolute or sheer dependence. While Neville would be friendly to aspects of this account, he prefers to work in the other direction via a cluster of interrelated arguments that refuse to privilege the human starting point. At the heart of these argu ments is the sense that creation could only be what it is because of an eternal creative act that transcends creation. Yet it does not follow that we can say why God created the world, or why the world is unified in the way that it is.7 Neville is quite clear that Leibniz's theodicy is in error. That is, it makes no sense to see some kind of divine mind prior to creation making decisions as to which essential perfections will be granted existence in such a way as to maximize the amount of realized perfection in the world.8 Neville's God has 6 Thus Pannenberg can say, "Creation and eschatology belong together because it is only in the eschatological consummation that the destiny of the creature, especially the human creature, will come to fulfillment. . . . Nevertheless, creatures that are awakened to independence (i.e., living creatures) open themselves to the future as the dimension from which alone their existence can achieve content and fulfillment." Systematic Theology, Vol. 2, trans, by Goeffrey W. Bromiley (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 1994), 139. 7 Neville, God the Creator, 71. 8 Leibniz gives a clear statement of his view of essence and perfection in his 1697 essay, On the Ultimate Origination of Things. He states, ". . . all possibles, that is, everything that expresses essence or possible reality, strive with equal right for existence in proportion to the amount of essence or reality or the degree of perfection they contain, for perfection is nothing but the amount of essence." Taken from G. W. Leibniz: Philosophical Essays, ed. and trans.</page><page sequence="5">_Vol. 18, No. 3, September 1997_261 no mind, and entertains no possible universes prior to the act of creation. Hence we must endure the utter mystery of why the world is as it is. There are no sufficient reasons linking a divine decision with creation. What lies beyond the sphere of sufficient reasons, so carefully developed by seventeenth century thinkers? Shifting to more theological language, Neville emphasizes the radical novelty of creation and its grace filled heart. The essential and indeterminate God becomes the creator through an eternal act of self-constitution: God as source creates the world, having no determinate need to do so but strictly and purely out of divine self-constituting grace. The universe is wholly dependent for its existence as a set of determinate things on God as source. That God is source is itself a function of the world's being created.9 The primal and gracious act of creation is asymmetrical in the sense that the created cannot in turn act on the creator. The process account, it will be remembered, is a symmetrical one in that the subjective aims and prehensive fields of actual occasions can add to and modify the divine life through their death and simultaneous objective immortality. Hartshorne's God can indeed be surprised and transformed in a way that Neville's cannot. God, in becoming conditionally determinate through the eternal act of creation that creates space, time, and the world, overcomes its utter trans cendence. The world that the now relational God creates is a closed one. By this Neville does not mean that it is a bound but expanding totality in the sense of contemporary astrophysics, although this may be the case on the cosmological level, but that it consists of the "sum" of all determinate things.10 The bridge between the power of God the creator and the created orders is through the economic trinity. Here Neville works out of the classical dis tinction between the immanent trinity, namely, the trinity an sich, and the economic trinity seen as the time-embracing unfolding of God's glory within creation. He privileges the economic trinity precisely because his own Roger Ariew and Daniel Garber (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1989). 9 Robert Neville, A Theology Primer (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1991 ), 40-41. 10 Ibid., 30.</page><page sequence="6">262 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy conception of the indeterminate ground would make it profoundly difficult to probe into the immanent trinity prior to its self-determination under the conditions of temporality and finitude. sing traditional language, he sees God as the source of everything determinate, God the Son as the product or end point of the creative act, while the Spirit is the creative activity itself11 The economic trinity, the "how" of the indeterminate ground as it becomes determinate, moves to overcome the utter transcendence of God. The creating God, as opposed to the creator prior to creation, is immanent within all of the orders of the world. Like Tillich, Neville has a strong sacramental sense of the incarnation; namely, that it is manifest in forms of divinization or epiphanies of power that directly participate in the conditional God. In some passages that might shock Barthians, Neville insists that the human process can enter into the power of God and take on some of its divine power.12 While we can rest assured that Neville knows what the Protestant Principle is for, he also wants to free the self from its alienation from God by his categorial sense that direct participation in creative activity is indeed part of the way of grace, as most clearly actualized in the Covenant.13 The paradox here is that Neville has an extreme sense of divine transcendence combined with an equally extreme sense of divine immanence. His interest in world religions has its source, so I would argue, in this deep sensitivity to the innumerable ways that the triune God can appear within the world and the human process. Like Pannenberg, Neville insists that God is robustly self-revealing in the history of religions. His theory of revelation works in consort with his ontology to show that what had been meant by revelation, as the presentation of group-specific information, can best be seen as a special kind of learning that is less bound to antecedent "messages," II. 11 Ibid., 39. 12 Ibid., 18-19. 13 Ibid., 52.</page><page sequence="7">_Vol. 18, No. 3, September 1997_263 which are often little more than demonic missives from the gods of space.14 The dialectical tension between God's essential transcendence and conditional immanence does not, however, bifurcate God into two dis connected dimensions that can only speak to each other across an abyss of nonbeing (a concept that has already been ruled out). In some mysterious sense, the indeterminate ground "chose" in a non-necessary and non emanating way to create both itself as determined and the closed world of determinate things. We have absolutely no access with any of our philosophical tools to the inner logic of this non-chosen choice. We simply live in the continuing power of its ongoing effects. All of our spatial and temporal pictures of this event of creation shatter on the rock of the ontological difference between being-itself and the things of the world. But there is a very striking sense in which we are left with more than enough semiotic material that can serve as signs of God's radical immanence. Like Bonaventura, Neville can see the "footprints of God" within creation and can follow those footprints back to the invisible sign maker that never creates an order without leaving its traces in its product. Perhaps the most dramatic footprints of the creator are found in the elusive momenta of time and time's flow. One of the most basic connecting links between creation and the created is that between time's flow and eternity. Neville has taken very great pains to develop a theory of eternity that does full justice to our own experience of time. He reworks his understanding of eternity in the context of a philosophical environment that privileges the present and has a subsidiary tendency to spatialize time as if it could be bound and contained in discrete packets. To understand eternity it is also necessary to give equal ontological standing to all three modes of time and to despatialize our understanding of any or all of these modes. The analysis of eternity and time also opens up the basic ontology of things, insofar as each determinate thing is what it is vis-?-vis the mode of time in which it obtains. Here we begin to get a glimpse of Neville's quasi process form of naturalism. I call it a "quasi-process" form because of the centrality of such notions as decision, spontaneous creativity, actualization, 14 Paul Tillich, Die Sozialistische Entscheidung (Potsdam: Alfred Protte, 1933). The English translation is by Franklin Sherman, The Socialist Decision (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1977).</page><page sequence="8">264_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ objective everlastingness, and pure normative form. While Neville will, of course, deny that these terms denote or imply an anthropomorphic structure, we shall see that they do serve to give an honorific and zo?semiotic (even anthroposemiotic) stamp to the delineation of the fundamental traits of the orders of the world. While he has gone beyond the mythology of the actual occasion, thereby refusing to reduce the things of the world to some kind of primal atomic whatness, he still clings to notions that can only blunt the generic sweep of a naturalism that wishes to honor the utter complexity of the world's traits, many of which obtain in utter semiotic darkness. The first thing to note is that time is created, that is, it is not an emergent product, perhaps from spatial extension, and that its creation is rooted in the eternal. Thus the ultimate source of time and time's flow is in the indeterminate ground, "God is the living dynamism of the eternal act creating time's flow."15 It is interesting that Neville brings in rather dynamic language at this point to indicate the living connection between eternity and the three modes of time known to the human process. He also prefers to talk of "time's flow" rather than the moments of time so as to stress the gathering and sustaining power of eternity that continually erases any ultimate atomicity or epochal quality for the moments of time. Philosophical and theological perspectives often unwittingly privilege one mode of time, thus putting the other two into a kind of ontological eclipse. Earlier we noted that Neville's indeterminate being-itself does not have the features of many of the more recent eschatological Gods, who groan through creation, read in politically correct terms, toward an ultimate theophany on the nether side o?chronos. At the other extreme are those perspectives driven by the myth of origin that make antecedent orders numinous per se. Tillich, more forcefully than anyone else, has brilliantly deconstructed these powers of "blood and soil" and shown that they must be chastened by the God of time. Of course, he ends up privileging the future in this move, thereby blunting the efficacy of his framework. There is a sense in which the process view of epochal time privileges the present, insofar as the only living realities are those that are in the infinitesimal moment of becoming in which the past ingresses according to the lure of the future. 15 Robert Neville, Eternity and Time 's Flow (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1993), 13.</page><page sequence="9">_Vol. 18, No. 3, September 1997_265 A further problem with the process reading of epochal time and ingression is that it cannot allow for genuine otherness or discontinuity within the finite orders of the world. The self is the world from the perspective of a subjective form. Neville makes a bold move at this point to rescue a strong sense of difference or otherness for the orders of time so that they are not reduced to a common set of traits or gathered into the power of an omnivorous subjective form. Above we noted some of the differentia for the three modes of time in their essential constitution. The present is characterized by decision and spontaneous creativity. This is, of course, a strongly flavored process account. The past is essentially the fixed reality of objective everlastingness, not, however, as preserved in some alleged consequent nature of God but in the eternity that cannot be consequent to anything within the determinate orders of the world. The past is "the fixed achievements of the universe, all structurally ordered and determinate with respect to one another and each embodying an actualized value."16 The future is essentially a kind of normative reality, the locus of value. Interestingly, Neville rejects anything like a static primordial mind in which compossible forms would reside, and affirms a kind of Peircean "would be" or conditional. His formulation is precise, "Form is what would integrate a plurality, real or subjunctive."17 The three modes of time are both distinct from each other, and deeply relevant to each other. Neville, as always, wants to avoid any static or con tainer analogies that would compartmentalize time. The differentia among the modes are related to their essential and conditional ways of being, rather than to some kind of locatedness that has fixed boundaries. The way of being for the modes of time in consort is to flow together in a kind of "ontological context of mutual relevance."18 But the foundation for this relevance is not through ingression of the past and responsiveness to the divine lure in the future. Rather, it is through a direct and total participation in eternity, "Eternity is the condition for and inclusion of time's flow."19 Looking more directly at eternity, if such language is not too guilty of hubris, we can rule out some misguided conceptions that have plagued generic 16 Neville,/! Theology Primer, 68-69. 17 Neville, Eternity andTime's Flow, 102. 18 Ibid., 109. 19 Ibid., 112.</page><page sequence="10">266_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ level analysis. For Neville, eternity cannot be: 1) static form, 2) the totum simul (a position he sees embodied in Augustine and Hartshorne), 3) a total determinate fact, 4) normative goodness, or 5) an Aristotelian unmoved mover. For one thing, the future is still open in the sense that it is the dimension of the "would be," thus ruling out 1, 3 (which privileges the past), and 5. Number 4 is ruled out on the grounds that eternity is the measure o/form and thus the reality that empowers and sustains form from outside of itself, shades of Plato's Euthyphro. Number 2 is ruled out because the concept of the divine mind grasping all reality at once privileges the present and makes genuine future novelty impossible. III. It is crucial that time's flow be understood from the perspective of eternity. That is, one cannot separate human time from eternity as they entail each other in any sustained analysis of the way of God and God's created world. The mutual relevance of the three modes of time to each other is made possible by the presence of eternity, "the only thing that could constitute an ontological context of mutual relevance is an eternal divine creative act and that the eternal dynamism of time's flow constitutes what we should mean by the life of God."20 Hence God approaches us with a special power and intimacy in the flow of time that we learn to experience when we overcome the idolatry and any one mode of time. The past is ontologically different from the present and future, and the same applies to the other two modes. Difference is preserved while identity is secured through the flow of time that participates in eternity. Put in stronger terms, eternity is as close to us as our own breath. Eternity and the flow of time are grace-filled even if things in time often suffer blindly and have no sense of their whence and whither. Neville's conception of the future is particularly fascinating because it represents an alternative to the process view while still using some of the more basic process categories. The future is tied to form and different forms entail different values. "It is the forms in things that make the difference in value "21 Yet we must always ask: just where are the forms? Whitehead would 20 Ibid., 113. 21 Ibid., 89.</page><page sequence="11">_Vol. 18, No. 3, September 1997_267 have us believe that they are resident in the primordial mind of God, waiting to be sent out as tantalizing lures to hungry actual occasions. Neville, a reconstructed process thinker and Platonist, prefers to let the future have its own distinctive features. Hence, forms are not mental quasi-actualizations in a divine mind, but realities awaiting actualization via the other modes of time. "Far better to say that form is the essential feature of the future and that determinate forms are the ways the future is made determinate by concrete actualities in the past and by the shifting decisions of present moments."22 Actualities and decisions work together to render certain forms actual to the things of the world. These forms are located in a kind of cosmic "would be" that is not a form-bank so much as a potential for actualization. By putting form in this special ontological niche, Neville preserves a more genuine sense of novelty than Whitehead for whom all eternal entities are already attained. The function of form, as the locus of value, is to sustain the togetherness of things. The relation between form and the future prepares the way for an analysis of things in their essential and conditional reality. By looking at the determinate things in the closed world of time we can gain access to the most basic "where" of God vis-?-vis nature, understood here as creation or nature natured. It is at this point that many of Neville's most creative categorial elaborations come home to roost. We have noted that a fundamental distinction in his system is that between the essential aspect of a thing and its conditional aspect. Creation is constituted by the "sum" of all determinate things that each share in some mixture of essence and con ditionality. Each and every thing is determinate is some, but not all respects. "That a thing is determinate does not mean it is wholly determinate: the future is not wholly determinate, for instance, although it is what it is at least by being future to something in its past."23 Hence anything occupying a time process will have some of its future open to it, even though this opening may be infinitesimally small in a given case. A Peircean would even say that the laws of nature are themselves only partially determinate and that they could take on new habits in the future as they are punctuated by firstness and secondness. 22 Ibid. 23 Neville, ,4 Theology Primer, 30.</page><page sequence="12">268_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ Thus we should be clear that the word "determinateness" in no way denotes or connotes a closed deterministic system for Neville, although my suspicion is that his universe is a little less rambunctious than Hartshorne's on this issue. Be that as it may, each and every thing (and the word "thing" is used as an extremely generic place holder for the differentia of the world) has an essential core and a deep relational or conditioned dimension. Neville is very much aware of the issue of identity over time and faults the process epochal view for failing to give a depth structure to the human character and the other things of the world.24 Instead of little epochal pulses that hand the torch of identity down the line, he prefers to see each thing as having an essential core that endures per se and that helps to order the conditional features by and through which the thing takes on relations and relata. More precisely, normative form relates to essential features to sustain identity, "the continuity, the irreducible unity of a life, the subjectivity of the whole, is a matter of the normative side of the forms, of essential features."25 He refers to his perspective on things as an "axiological pluralism," where the focus is on the role normative form plays in the ultimate constitution of the things of the world. Even more important is his sense that things are not relational in a totalistic sense. For a process thinker, any given actual occasion will positively or negatively prehend all non-contemporary occasions, thus entering into what could be called an absolute web of robust internal relations. Neville's naturalism comes to the fore when he denies that such relational totalities exist. A given thing will have "multiple effective locations,"26 but these lo cations will not belong to some kind of super-field that envelops all subaltern realities. Arguing against Weiss's view that space-time fields are antecedent to their "occupants," Neville insists that fields are themselves products or functions of harmonies, and harmonies are subject to change over time. Therefore the cosmos cannot be a totality that is in some sense prior to all things. No thing will be related to all other things. There are genuine 24 Robert Neville, The Cosmology of Freedom (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974), 40-51. Reprinted with a new Preface by SUNY Press in 1995. 25 Ibid., 50-51. 26 Robert Neville, Recovery of the Measure: Interpretation and Nature (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1989), 148.</page><page sequence="13">Vol. 18, No. 3, September 1997 269 ontological breaks in the world that cannot be filled in, especially by an idealistic system that refuses to grasp the utter power of secondness within continua. Thus a thing, the constituent of creation (nature natured), will sustain itself against decay by having intrinsic and essential features. Its conditional features will, of course, be subject to spoliation or augmentation as environing conditions change. As we have just seen, the concept of "harmony" now makes its entrance as the togetherness of the essential and the conditional features of the thing. Neville rejects the atomistic view that would confine harmony to the essential features alone (a position defended in Wittgenstein's Tractatus), and wants us to understand it as a strong bridge connecting the essential and the conditional. The concept of harmony is, of course, one found in process perspectives, and has a decided aesthetic cast. The harmony of any given thing does not come to it from outside, but is its own structure of togetherness. We gain access to it by a kind of aesthetic intuition. We are cautioned, however, not to assume that the word "harmony" always denotes a stability or a peaceful process of regular change. Harmonies can be profoundly displeasing and need not reflect anything congenial to human aspiration or desire. In this sense, the concept of harmony is morally neutral. Neville accepts Whitehead's general cosmological view that harmony brings a multiplicity into a unity; namely, "that the reality of the event for itself is the processive becoming of the unity."27 But the internal creativity of any event/thing is deeply related to the ontological creativity of God. Re member, for Neville the process tradition has erred in separating creativity, as some kind of ultimate ground, from God. In particular, this muddies the relation between God and the world by making divine presence almost a secondary reality. He sees an intimate relationship between self-becoming in time's flow and the continuing power of ontological creativity. Put in theological terms, it is as if the creation is actually the same event as the act of sustaining the world. If Tillich can identify creation as the Fall into finitude, I suppose Neville is allowed to see the creative power of the in-determinate ground as continually present in the things/events of the world. Again, his sense of utter transcendence is richly balanced by his sense of the radical immanence of eternal creativity in the movement of self-forming events toward 27 Neville, Creativity and God, 8.</page><page sequence="14">270_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ harmony and unity. Things/events are thus in formation in the present, responsive to that which obtains everlastingly in the past, and open to prospects of trans formation in the future. While Neville is hardly a thinker of the groaning not yet, he does understand that self-formation requires an intimate relation between God and the future. However, this relation is one of divine otherness in which God remains deeply elusive to our present desires and inquiries. In a particularly striking passage which I quote at some length, he lays out the correlation of human or thingly temporality and divine eternity: From our limited standpoint, where the future is still open and at which point the eternal actual resolution of our future connection does not exist, the future of God's address to us is "other." The character God will take in response to our needs and to our deserts remains alien to us in the present, however real it is in eternity. From the standpoint of the present, God's creation in the future is really other; this issue is not one of our ignorance. Even God does not now know what the future holds because God is never only now. For ourselves, who truly are temporal, existing now with a future still future, the future and God's special presence as redemptive or condemnatory, helpful or negligent, merciful or punitive, remains other.28 Insofar as pre-human orders are also to some extent self-choosing, this categorial framework can be applied across the board. What is interesting is that our temporality is clearly blind to its own whence and whither, and can only see God, qua future, as an alien otherness that may or may not be punitive or helpful, etc. Yet I do not see Neville as affirming a kind of Hartshornian blindness on the part of God, insofar as God truly lives in and as eternity. It takes a great stretching of mind to understand the seeming paradox between God's blindness in the now, which is, of course, a misconception on our part, and God's omniscience in eternity. In structural terms I would say that there 28 Nev?k, Eternity and Time 's Flow, 211-12.</page><page sequence="15">Vol. 18, No. 3, September 1997 271 is no room for a not yet being in eternity, while there can be an energizing otherness/future for finite and perspectival orders. Things/events are self-forming creatures of time and eternity that combine essential and conditional features, participate in the primal creative act that is still with us, harmonize from within their diverse traits, contain form qua value, and occasionally show forth the glory of the creator in their sacramental splendor. Nature, which is "constituted" by these things, is the measure within which things can form themselves the way that they do. Neville rejects anything like some super order of nature that would measure each and every thing in some kind of prescient way. Rather, the measure of nature comes from the orders themselves as they participate in each other and in the divine creative ground. From the human perspective, our own interpretive acts are validated insofar as they bind themselves to a measure that is extra-human. "Interpretation is a special kind of participation in the natural world by natural beings."29 In a quasi-process form of naturalism it follows that other beings beside the human interpret, and that they too must participate in environing conditions that can provide a powerful goad to hermeneutic success, since the cost of interpretive failure could be death. ow that we have arrived at the concept of nature that is implied in JL Neville's concepts of the divine and the divine's creation, we can begin the far more difficult task of appraisal and critique. I have devoted a great deal of energy to the task of exposition because of the painfully reiterated experience that philosophers rarely take the time and care to truly understand each other. In a perspective as rich and powerful as Neville's, it is imperative that the basic categories be delineated with sensitivity and care. Whether I have succeeded in this remains to be seen, but my hope is that at least the rudimentary topology of this landscape has been charted by the preceding reflections. Neville's arguments against the process account are compelling in the main. But my own rejection of the process perspective comes from a sense that the world is fundamentally a sad place and that naturalism, not quasi-process IV. 29 Neville, Recovery of the Measure, 5.</page><page sequence="16">272_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ naturalism, is the one perspective that has the courage to be sad in an informed way. From this it follows that I do not think that Neville has enough onto logical sadness to be a true naturalist, certainly not of the ecstatic variety that must face the utter indifference of the ground to anything that issues from it, even while honoring the self-transforming energies that do obtain in the innumerable orders of nature natured. While this evocation of ontological sadness may not sound like an argument, and I hesitate to place it before an interlocutor who is a master of rigorous argumentation, it does emerge out of a perspective that is to some extent an articulation of what this ground feeling has uncovered. For me, the fruitful interchange between thinkers involves an exhibition and articulation of what they each see as well as the underlying strategies that may support the infrastructure that corresponds to their vision. After all, any significant philosophical framework is overdetermined as to antecedents and no one argumentative trail or strategy can exhaust the richness, and occasional internal contradictions, of the nurturing streams. On the other hand, I do not want to end up with a kind of morpho logical comparison in which you are asked to pick the metaphysical flavor that is most appealing. Therefore, something like arguments will make their appearance in our remaining reflections, remembering that all such strategies are at the service of a vision that has deep unconscious roots and motivations. It is one thing to say that one is ontologically sad, it is another to say why. My hope is that the reader will share this sadness by the end of our reflections, and will know the reasons why this must be so. Following our wayward trail, then, I wish to focus on three distinct issues. The first is the nature of the things of the world as articulated in a quasi-process account verses a semiotic one rooted in ecstatic naturalism. The second is with the nature of the indifferent ground and its relation, or lack thereof, to unity. The third is with the twin concepts of nature and God as they refract each other through different prisms. The primal feeling-tone of ecstatic naturalism will weave itself in and around the categorial elaborations, bringing us to the boundary where ontological sadness envelops but remains open to a kind of naturalist jouissance, understood as the eros that is the true meaning of agape. We have seen how Neville still uses mentalistic language to describe the trajectory of given things within time's flow. Things decide, are spontaneous, shape a harmony that unites essential and conditional traits, and</page><page sequence="17">_Vol. 18, No. 3, September 1997_273 embody value. Neville gives great weight to the concept of value in his system. Even truth, and the search for validation, is related to the disclosure of value, "If reality is the achievement of value, then truth must say what that value is; and if this is so, then saying what properties a thing has contributes to truth telling only insofar as the bearing of properties is tied to the achieved value."30 And, of course, form is never far away, "value is the implicit contribution of form."31 Like John Cobb, Neville envisions the world as the locus of increments of value, all participating in nature itself. It should be pointed out that Neville does stress participation as a key ingredient in his naturalism and theory of interpretation. Signs, values, objects, and selves all participate in an infinitely complex nature that is enveloping, at least in a secondary sense vis ?-vis the creator. What are we to make of concepts like "harmony" and "value"? Are they innocent descriptors within an otherwise healthy metaphysical system, or are they really Trojan horses of an anti-naturalist perspective that still clings to honorific language? Neville has stated more than once that he rejects the process understanding of a di-polar God, while affirming a process under standing of the things of the world. However, as noted, he goes beyond the windowed monads of Whitehead toward a more judicious macro or meso account of the orders of the world. Of even greater importance is his stated rejection of panpsychism for what he calls pan-naturalism that allows for different levels of reality, some of which are indeed material and opaque to any form of mentality. The process account in its classical form, i.e., before it is reconstructed by Neville, privileges the present experience of the actual occasion. Neville wants to speak of what he calls "discursive actualities" that are "enduring," and "temporally thick." The concept of the "discursive actuality" covers most of the discriminda of experience. Neville refers to a human being as a "discursive individual." In either case, the important point is that the things of the world are equally embodied in all three modes of time, even though each mode will prevail in a different way. In rejecting panpsychism, does Neville escape the net of idealism that wishes to mentalize the world? Is his axiological pluralism the real Trojan horse because it smuggles in normative structures where we should remain on 30 Ibid., 68. 31 Ibid., 161.</page><page sequence="18">274_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ the level of description? To put the question differently, does Neville conflate honorific with descriptive language, precisely because his creator God is immanent within things somehow supporting value in an otherwise cold and entropie universe? Could he talk at all about things as "discursive actualities" without God and eternity propping them up against what might still be called absolute nonbeing? The answer seems to be no. And I might make an even stronger claim. If eternity and God are present within creation in the way that Neville intends, can he really outflank panpsychism in his categorial delineation of things? The issue of value in the ontology of things is a sticky one. On the one hand, Neville is to be commended for his unrelenting efforts to deprivilege the anthropocentric starting point. While I think that his quasi-process form of naturalism fails in this task, it fails less dreadfully than almost all of the alternatives. On the other hand, Neville seems to fall prey to a kind of cosmic mythology that wants things to be far more meaningful and structurally loaded with positivity than they can possibly be. I have in mind his idea that there is "an infinitely dense achievement of value presented in each component."32 This is a principle of plenitude that might make even Leibniz blush. Neville is a very subtle Plato scholar and knows what happened to Plato when he made his Forms (assuming that they "exist" at all) into normative structures; namely, "Plato had a profound insight in associating the Good with form."33 Plato's later dialogues, however, show his awakening to this problem, as well as his awareness of the need to counter Aristotle's analysis of four-fold causation. Neville, of course, wants harmony to be in and through things, rather than functioning as an outside principle that somehow hovers in an indeterminate way before instantiation in particulars. It is not just a problem of terminology, although I doubt that merely terminological problems exist on this level of reflection, but a sense that the terms chosen, especially those that have a process pedigree, subtly extrude a kind of semi-conscious mental aura onto the things of the world. The Trojan horse comes into the naturalist settlement and begins to leak, not Greek soldiers, but brightly shining values and harmonies that gather around things that are otherwise opaque or semiotically dense. I have stated that the quasi 32 Ibid., 155. 33 Ibid., 154.</page><page sequence="19">_Vol. 18, No. 3, September 1997_275 process form of naturalism is in tension with a semiotic understanding of the orders of nature natured. This is an especially ticklish point because Neville and I both have deep roots in Peirce's semiotics, as opposed to the minor and glottocentric tradition of Saussure, where roots can hardly even be said to exist. Yet I suspect that Neville and I do very different things with the Peirce we inherit, and that his crypto-idealism surfaces at this point. Put in Peircean terms, a framework on the semiosis of things can, but need not, stress one of Peirce's three primal categories: firstness, which is a kind of swirling and indeterminate "could be;" secondness, which is brute diadicity without intelligibility; or thirdness, which for Neville would be normative form and value as related to harmony, that is, a potentially determinate "would be." Quasi-process naturalism will stress thirdness, its own rhetoric notwithstanding, while ecstatic naturalism understands that the depth mystery of nature and "its" things lies in firstness. Of course, it goes without saying that to be a discrimandum at all is to embody all three categories, even if in a degenerate form. Firstness has no degenerate case since it does not admit of comparisons. My sense is that Peirce remained profoundly ambivalent about the relation between God and the three categories.34 Is God an emergent and developmental force that is self-clothing in thirdness, or is God the material maternal35 that is mysteriously tied to the heterogeneous momenta of nature? This ambivalence about the locatedness of the divine is directly relevant to the way things are envisioned. A quasi-process reading of Peirce and of God and God's creation will privilege thirdness, almost in spite of itself, thereby bringing the lucidity of concrete reasonableness to the things of the world. Neville's being-itself is, of course, prior to thirdness. But his God the creator as self-determining in the eternal act of creation, clothes itself in the Logos structures that bring an ultimate intelligibility to nature and things. For Neville, thirdness qua Logos involves pattern, components, actuality, and value.36 Logos is God's character as expressed in each thing. This character 34 Robert Conington, An Introduction to C. S. circe: Philosopher, Semiotician, and Ecstatic Naturalist (Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1993). 35 Robert Corrington, "Nature's God and the Return of the Material Maternal," The American Journal of Semiotics X (1993): 115-132. 36 Neville,/! Theology Primer, 30.</page><page sequence="20">276_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ is intelligible and available to semiotic scrutiny. Divine footprints are, by definition, examples of thirdness. Of course, one can fall directly under one and experience divine secondness, much like Job. Hence, for Neville, God's character, as loving creator, appears within the semiotic structures of things. Philosophical theology is the description and appraisal of semiotic thirds as they manifest themselves within religious experience. The first and fourth aspect of Logos come to the fore; namely, pattern and value. But what happens if semiosis moves in the opposite direction, toward the ground of absolute indifference that has no obligation to any of its offspring? Thirdness does not collapse in secondness, nor does firstness pull the world back into the material maternal. Something far less dramatic happens, even though this movement will transform thirdness and make it translucent to something that always hovers around its edges. For the ecstatic naturalist, semiosis consists of a series of reminders of the ejective ground that lies trembling within the heart of each thing. Any thing within the domain of nature natured will be the potential locus of signs and interpr?tants.37 We can feel the dyadic pressure of things, and we can gage their intelligibility (Logos as pattern and value). But we must also develop something darkly analogous to Neville's aesthetic intuition. This special night vision, if you will, is a kind of melancholy tinged eros that hungers to return to the ejective, but non-nurturing ground. Firstness is that "within" each thing that pulls it back to the origin that has no semiotic density, nor any possible relation to Logos or thirdness, however defined. Things interact and open out thirdness. Yet they also contain traces of the elusive primal otherness that made them possible in the first place. For the human process, the most basic ground feeling is that of loss, experienced in each and every form of suffering that punctuates life. Signs become transparent to this loss when the sign-using organism sees that elusive space between the sign and its object, between the sign and its interpr?tant, and Within thePeirce community there is a continuing debate as to whether or not interpr?tants (signs emerging from previous and less interpreted signs) require some entertaining mind in order to exist. Peirce's texts fail to give a definitive answer. For the pansemiotician, all orders can generate signs, and many, whether funded by mind or not, can create or sustain interpr?tants. From the perspective of my own ecstatic naturalism, it makes the most sense to see just how far "down" we can envision interpr?tants, perhaps erring on the side of ontological generosity.</page><page sequence="21">_Vol. 18, No. 3, September 1997_277 between the interpr?tant and its inheritor. In this ontologically unique space of betweenness, there is something like an open draft or pull toward the un conscious of nature. Signs struggle toward lucidity and toward consciousness, yet their betweenness structures all point in the opposite direction, toward the far more pervasive unconscious of nature, an unconscious in which even gods and goddesses disappear, perhaps even the Gods of Western monotheism. The unconscious heart of signs and their corollary things is not simply to be equated with entropy, which is, of course, a cosmological notion. The image is not so much disorder and loss of heat in a closed system as it is the haunting presence/absence of an ejective ground and abyss that has absolutely no teleology, no thirdness, no agape, and no ultimate plan for the human process. Things harbor a place where the prepositional ground can enter into and alter positionality, thereby making thirdness vibrate to a deeper melody of loss. This break thorough of nature naturing is far from being a harmony, or a value, or a form that could somehow constitute a divinely supported unity of the thing. In a fundamental sense, things are "on their own" against the churning night of the unconscious of nature. Signs and sign systems live in a nature that has more semiotic fecundity than it has semiotic space. Spoliation and loss permeate the orders of nature natured, leaving each and every foundling of nature naturing without a positive ontological creative ground. Unities exist within the manifest orders of the world, but there is no creative ground that somehow supports or even "wants" unities. Unities are in and among finite orders or not at all. We have seen that Neville envisions the indeterminate ground as the ultimate source of the one that can permeate the many. The one, in his sense, is, by definition, a unity within things and for the closed world as a whole, although this latter sense is tempered by the awareness that this unity is not some kind of bound order or container, a heteronomous Logos, if you will. Thus Neville envisions a unity that is emergent from the ground as that ground gives itself the Logos that can be manifest in the flow of time. From my perspective, unity is an ideal within the fragmented orders of nature natured and has absolutely no relation to the heterogenous ground o? nature naturing. I confess to being one of those thinkers of the groaning not yet being, but I try to confine these groans to emergent interpr?tants and spiritual pulsations within the orders of the world. Each thing of the world is a foundling, cast out of the dark garden o? nature naturing, carried forward by</page><page sequence="22">278 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy signs and interpr?tants into the promiscuous orders of nature natured, and, where mental, caught in the painful dialectic of melancholy longing for the lost object and the hope for erotic transfiguration in the not yet. Now, as we conclude our reflections, we must ask: where is God in all of this? e should now have a fairly clear picture of what Neville means by God, V even though we need to be mystics to become permeable to the "way" of being-itself. How does an ecstatic naturalist see God? Neville, of course, thinks that I have it wrong. In a recent review of my second book he states that my first and second divine dimensions, that is God as fragmented origin and God as fragmented goal within the innumerable orders of the world, are "merely spooky and secularly moral, respectively."381 certainly do not want to foist a "spooky" God on the world, as we have enough frightening ephemera as it is. Nor do I want to pawn off a kind of secular moralist who tells us how to clean up our corrupt social orders. As to my fourth divine dimension, where God is self-overcoming in the face of the almost mocking unconscious of nature (nature natuhng or the Encompassing), and my third divine dimension were God is sheerly relevant to all of the orders of nature natured, Neville sees only a novel but weak Gnosticism in which the ancient and nasty Gnostic God is replaced by one that is "politically correct."39 Why not, he asks, just worship nature naturing and "eliminate middling gods?"40 Why not? Because they are there as complex products of an "eternally" ejective nature that spawns the numinous and its carrier for reasons that will forever remain beyond our ken. It is at this point that I can make my final observation, one that is clearly adumbrated in Neville's critique. Quasi-process naturalism has generated a picture of nature that is too small and too tied to a creative ground that seems to privilege human traits. The nature that is delineated is too small and too ready to enter into semiotic lucidity. The God that creates/sustains this V. 38 Robert Neville, Review of Robert Corrington's Nature and Spirit: An Essay in Ecstatic Naturalism, International Philosophical Quarterly, XXXIV (December, 1994) 504-5. 39 Ibid., 504-5. 40 Ibid., 505.</page><page sequence="23">Vol. 18, No. 3, September 1997 279 wonderful world is so large as to become thin and spooky in its own right. Nature shrinks, God grows, things hum to the tune of the loving Logos, and the human process knows that there is a fitting home, if not here and now, at least in the embrace of eternity that weaves itself in and through time's flow, although the weaving, of course, does not take place in time.41 In ecstatic naturalism nature is understood to be both the indeterminate unconscious of nature naturing and the impossibly complex and fragmented domain of nature natured. God is an emergent product of the unconscious of nature while also being located within the orders of the world in reasonably specifiable ways. Yet God is not processive in the romantic sense of Whitehead and Hartshorne, but in a far more fitful way in which the divine can be at war with itself. Thus the epiphanies of power of the first divine dimension (God as fragmented origin) can be in tension with the lure toward justice in the second divine dimension (God as fragmented goal). The first two dimensions of God are thus fully orders within the world. The third dimension is somewhat akin to Neville's sustaining aspect of God with the strong proviso that God is absolutely indifferent to the orders of the world in this mode of sheer relevance (that is, God cannot alter a single trait of the world). For an ecstatic naturalist, God is encountered in those erotic moments in which the melancholy lure of the lost object is briefly overcome by the encompassing presence of the not yet. Nature per se is absolutely indifferent to its most semiotically complex product (in our small corner of the galaxy), but there is a presence/absence within nature that has traits that are unique among all of the other orders of the world. We are all expelled from the garden of nature naturing, an ontologically unique garden without a gardener. Once we are ejected, we can never return. But we can become permeable to the movements of the divine and reconfigure the lost object just as God must do again and again. Ontological sadness can never be fully erased, as there is genuine loss and tragedy in the world, but we can enter into an erotic 41 In terms of our home in eternity we are told that "God is the mansion's perfect host."
