<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. A Study of Kant. By JAMES WARD, F. B. A. Cambridge: At the University Press, 1922.-Pp. Viii, 206. Professor Ward's Study of Kant is, next to Edward Caird's two monumental volumes on The Critical Philosophy of Kant, the most important work in English that has appeared on Kant's philosophical achievement as a whole. I emphasize "as a whole," in order to pre- vent any odious comparisons of Ward's Study with Norman Kemp Smith's much more minute and detailed examination of the Critique of Pure Reason, by itself. The proper comparison is with Caird's treatise, and despite the startling disparity of size two volumes of over 650 pages each against one volume of barely more than 200 pages -Ward's discussion is, we may fairly affirm, no whit inferior in philosophical importance. Indeed, it provides an admirable contrast to Caird's treatment, for whereas Caird interprets Kant throughout as the forerunner of Hegel, Ward interprets him no less consistently as the successor of Leibniz. This last phrase, however, does less than justice to the originality which Ward concedes to Kant. For, if Kant, on Ward's view, shares Leibniz's metaphysics, he goes far be- yond Leibniz in working out the ways in which the activity of the sub- ject or self manifests itself in knowledge and morality, in aesthetic appreciation and in the teleological interpretation of Nature. " By a single principle Kant opened up for philosophy a renewed and fruitful career-by the central truth, I mean, which he called the synthetic unity of apperception" (p. 8o). Leibniz's monads had, indeed, been conceived as centers of spiritual activity, but that activity had re- mained empty and abstract until Kant-himself not clearly aware of what he was doing-worked out in detail its manifestations in the various realms of our experience, and thus showed how everywhere it determines the character and nature of the universe for us, at least in its universal (a priori) aspects. Needless to say, Ward's interpretation of Kant is but another instance of the truth that any independent thinker, who undertakes to sort out what is living from what is dead in Kant's philosophy, is bound to identify what is living with what he, personally, believes to be the truth about the universe. Mere Kantphilologie, however scholarly, will not guide us through the inconsistencies and ambiguities incidental to the development of Kant's thought, in which so many conflicting tendencies met and struggled for a reconciliation. The critic needs a clue through the maze, and it adds to, rather than de- tracts from, the merit of Ward's interpretation of Kant that he stresses 290</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 291 in Kant all the doctrines which fit into the pattern of his own philosoph- ical convictions, as we know them from his Naturalism and Agnos- ticism, from The Realm of Ends, and from Psychological Principles. And, correspondingly, when he criticizes Kant, it is generally for having ignored, or, at least, failed to make full use of, some principle which counts for much in Ward's own philosophy. It would be easy, but foolish, to object that such a treatment does not give us the real Kant, but only Ward's picture of Kant. For the real Kant (in this sense) was not known even to Kant himself, and when Kant was asked towards the end of his life who among his commentators had understood and interpreted him best, he could only answer," Schulze!" And even then he had to add the qualification, " Nach Buchstaben.' No, the great Kant-interpreters have all been independent thinkers who found their own truth adumbrated in Kant. And if we are wise, we shall not wish it otherwise. Ward, then, studying Kant in the light of his own philosophical convictions, finds the great value of Kant's philosophy in what, borrowing Kant's own term, he calls its anthropomorphic character. "Anthropomorphism" is a term which is nowadays in ill odour, and a careless reader may jump to the conclusion that Ward, in applying the term to Kant's work, means to condemn it. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is just what is anthropomorphic in Kant that Ward regards as living. It is just Kant's failure to be consistently anthropomorphic which provokes Ward's most searching criticisms. Now, what does "anthropomorphism" in this connection connote? From the Hertz Lecture on Kant which Ward delivered before the British Academy (cf. Proceedings, Vol. X) and which sums up the argument of his Study, we learn that it means "immanent meta- physics," i.e., " the projection on to the object of attributes pertaining to the subject-more exactly, the interpretation of the World in terms of Self " (H. L., p. i4). Again, to be anthropomorphic " is in general to interpret the world in terms of ourselves, and more especially to orientate the natural from the standpoint of the spiritual " (ibid., p. i8). Ward admits (Study, pp. I37, 8) that anthropomorphism is not a happy term, and suggests that "epistemological reflexion" would be better. But, it seems to me, the gain in respectability would be slight, and the price in added technicality heavy. Moreover the new term is, if possible, more ambiguous than the old one. For there are many thinkers, both realist and idealist, who would claim to be en- gaged in epistemological reflexion on the relation of subject to object, but who would emphatically reject the "anthropomorphic" theories of Kant and Ward.</page><page sequence="3">292 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. In detail, there are, according to Ward, three specific features of anthropomorphism in Kant. (i) First and foremost, there is, of course, the "transcendental unity of apperception" which is the source of all the categories. In synthesizing the manifold of sense according to its a priori forms, this unity of apperception imposes upon the ob- ject logical or formal characteristics. This is Kants' Kopernican revolution: such logical characters as the object has are projected upon it by the thinking subject. (2) "It is our own moral character which prompts us to believe in a realm of ends, to which we ourselves belong, and of which the Supreme Head is God " (Study, p. 132). (3) When we find the realm of nature conformable to the realm of ends; when we find mechanism organic, i.e., instrumental, to life; when we find the seeming contingency of nature in its details none the less reducible to relatively few and simple laws, and thus manage- able for intellects such as ours; when we find beauty supervening like an added grace upon the mechanical arrangements of nature- there is awakened in us the thought of another intelligence than ours, a supersensible intellectus archetypes, which has adapted nature to our intellectus ectypus. Thus, in each of the three great critiques, the central thought is anthropomorphic. Ward quotes Kant's own striking remark, "I am is the original of all objects," and treats it as the motto, so to speak, of anthropomorphism. He interprets it to mean that the categories are discovered in the subject's self-con- scious reflection upon itself, and then by analogy transferred to the object; that the recognition of other animate beings, and especially of other intelligences, other moral agents, comes with intersubjective intercourse; that the belief in God, whether as moral ruler of the world or as intellectus archetypes, is, once again, modelled on what the sub- ject knows of itself. Thus, Kant's metaphysics is a spiritual pluralism, like Leibniz's world of monads, and its foundation in fact is each subject's self-consciousness, the "I think, I am" of Descartes, the " active spirit" of Berkeley. Whilst, however, thus representing anthropomorphism as Kant's greatest philosophical achievement, Ward is inevitably compelled to criticize Kant severely for his failure to sustain his anthropomorphic point of view consistently, or to develop it fully. In fact, it appears that Kant is guilty both of sins of omission and of sins of commission. Among the former Ward enunciates chiefly four. (i) Kant forgets that experience is not merely cognitive, but also conative. In ac- quiring experience, we become, as Ward likes to put it, "expert by experiment." More important even than the presence of the object to us in experience is the interest which we take in the object. "In</page><page sequence="4">No. 3.1 REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 293 our intercourse with the external world we have limbs which the Ego controls as well as senses which the Non-Ego affects" (Study, p. 83; H. L., p. 12). (2) Such interest is in every subject "selective," to which observation Ward might well have added that every subject's position in the world is unique. For the individual perspective under which each subject, in Leibniz's phrase, " mirrors the universe" would seem to be equally the result of selectiveness of interest and of uniqueness of position. (3) Kant "might have seen that transcen- dental apperception is bound up with transsubjective intercourse "(H. L., p. 14); in other words, his eighteenth century individ- ualism makes him overlook the social character of knowledge and morality. It was Fichte who clearly grasped this aspect of Kant's central truth, viz., "the unity of the complete self at the level of social intercourse, when conscience emerges and the experient subject becomes a person and autonomous" (H. L., p. 21). (4) Kant, again sharing the lack of historical sense characteristic of his age, neglects to study the spontaneity of the subject genetically. Turning, now, to Kant's sins of commission, Ward emphasizes only one, but this a big one, with widespread ramifications throughout Kant's philosophy, viz., the doctrine of the inner sense, and its corollary that the self, like the external world, is experienced only as a phe- nomenon. It is, of course, obvious that, if the anthropomorphic thesis of the centrality of the subject and of its activity is to be main- tained, the doctrine of the inner sense must go. It, like other mistakes of Kant, is due to bad psychology. And it is not only utterly inconsistent with all that is said in the Critique of Pure Reason about the transcendental unity of apperception, but it leads also to the dualism of homo phenomenon and homo noumenon, empirical and intelligible character. Hence Ward, after devoting the first half of his Study to an exposition of Kant's anthropomorphism (pp. 4I-I39), applies himself in the second half to a searching and illuminating examination of the doctrine of the inner sense and of Kant's successive attempts to get around the difficulties which it created for him (pp. 139-i89). This part of the book is of exceptional value, especially in drawing attention to that remarkable passage in the Second Edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (B. 422 n.) where Kant tries to wriggle out of the toils by saying that, in affirming "I am," the subject apprehends itself "not as phenomenon, nor as thing in itself, but only as something that in fact exists." Ward acclaims this passage as definitely showing that " Kant has advanced beyond his critical standpoint as based on transcendental idealism" (Study, p. 170). Another revision, as Ward rightly points out, which a thorough- going and consistent anthropomorphism would necessitate in Kant's 20</page><page sequence="5">294 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. philosophy, is the cancelling of the distinction between constitutive categories and regulative ideas and principles. Whatever patterns the subject finds in its own nature for interpreting the world must all stand on the same level. Of course, like all other interpreters of Kant, Ward can support his case only by a selective emphasis on appropriate texts. In this he shows extraordinary skill and ingenuity, and many a reader who may have considered himself, as I did, well acquainted with Kant's writings, will be surprised both at the fresh light in which familiar passages appear, and at the new significance which has been acquired by pas- sages hitherto seemingly insignificant. It is this freshness, amounting in the aggregate to genuine originality in the treatment of Kant, which is so stimulating in Ward's book. Even where he travels over well- trodden ground-how well trodden only those can appreciate who have themselves followed in the tracks of Kantlitteratur-he manages to say things which arrest attention. The secret of his success is his mastery of his subject. No one nowadays can venture on an interpretation of Kant without a vast burden of technical learning. Ward has the learning, but he is not overwhelmed by it. On the contrary, he has that command of detail which enables him to single out the significant fact and throw it into bold relief, whilst courageously leaving aside the rest as irrelevant. In this respect, Ward's Study is a triumph of ripe scholarship. There is, no doubt, justice in Norman Kemp Smith's criticism (cf. Mind, N. S., Vol. XXXII, No. I28, PP. 482 ff.) that Ward should have made some reference to alternative interpretations of Kant's philoso- phy, instead of ignoring them completely. A critical comparison of this sort would, indeed, have been welcome, but there would have been the danger of its smothering the admirable terseness of Ward's argument, as it stands, under a mass of polemics. Ward has chosen to argue with Kant and not with rival interpreters of Kant, and there is much to be said for his choice. At any rate, whether or no we are convinced by his line of interpretation of Kant-I should myself say that it represents one strain of Kant's tangled thought at the expense of other strains-we must all join in acknowledging that his book will rank as a classic among English treatises on Kant, and that no serious student of Kant can afford to pass it by. The inestimable service of Ward is to have given us a brilliant statement of a relatively unortho- dox reading of Kant's philosophy, and one which had not hitherto been adequately presented to English-speaking students.
