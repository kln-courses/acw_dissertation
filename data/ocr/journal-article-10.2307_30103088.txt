<plain_text><page sequence="1">A MINOAN LARNAX FROM KNOSSOS (PLATES 27-30) AN unusual figurative larnax of Late Minoan III was discovered in the dromos of an Iron Age chamber tomb (107) in the KMF Cemetery north of Knossos. It is presented here in FIGS. I-5, 7, 9-o10, PLATES 27-30, at the generous invitation of the excavators H. W. Catling and J. N. Coldstream prior to their final publication of the North Cemetery.' Tomb 107, which lies on the western side of the cemetery, held pottery ofProtogeometric B to Early Orientalizing.2 The tomb was plundered, probably in the Hellenistic or Roman period, and the larnax was found in fragments mainly scattered throughout the dromos. Curiously, some pieces were discovered in the adjacent Tomb 75 and parts of the back (side B) were found in Tomb 294 some 50 m to the north-east. Most, however, was found deposited in the largest niche of Tomb 107, on the north side of the dromos. Altogether five niches were cut into the dromos, the greatest number of any of the tombs. The base of a second Minoan larnax was found in one of these; it was undecorated. A few small plain larnakes and four decorated (all fragmentary) were found in other tombs of the North Cemetery, one from the side chamber of Tomb Qat Tekke being painted with spiriform plants bordered by filled semicircles.3 Other Minoan finds from the cemetery include a sealstone engraved with a retorted animal found in an urn in Teke TombJ.4 The larnakes were not reused by the Iron Age incumbents though, as J. N. Coldstream has shown, the painter of two ninth-century urns deposited in Tomb 107 may have drawn inspiration from the imagery of the figured larnax.5 An early date in Late Minoan III-LM IIIAi -is indicated for the larnax by the decoration, which includes such ceramic motifs as retorted spirals, tricurved arch, parallel chevrons, wavy lines, and 'tree', and by the figures, whose closest analogies appear on the Ayia Triada sarcophagus (all of which are discussed below in the relevant sections).6 The larnax is of the typical LM III chest type, often said to be derived from panelled wooden chests.7 The sides taper inward slightly towards the base, the preserved dimensions of the long side being I.15 m (top)-I.o3 m (base), short sides 0.50 m (top)-o.46 m (base); height 0.66 m (including leg); average thickness 1.4-1.7 cm (centre sherds) to 2.4-2.7 cm (at the base). It was Acknowledgements. I am grateful to ProfessorJ. N. Coldstream for inviting me to write this article, and to Dr H. W. Catling, Director of the School's rescue excavations at the North Cemetery at Knossos, and the Managing Committee of the British School at Athens for permission to present the material in advance of the final publication. The larnax was restored by Mr Petros Petrakis, with additional joins found by Mr J. A. MacGillivray. The drawings in FIGS. 3-5, 7, 9-10 were made by the author and inked by Miss Emma Faull, those in FIGS. I-2 were made by Miss Faull.

Preliminary reports by H. W. Catling appeared in AR 23 (1976-7) 11-17; 25 (1978-9) 43-58, with two fragments of the larnax illustrated in fig. 4a, b p. 45. Tomb o07 was excavated in 1978 by Dr Catling. 2 See plan of the site: AR 1978-9, 44 fig. 2. Catling considers that the tomb was cut in PGB (ibid. 45), but Coldstream thinks it more likely to have been cut in LM III and reused (1984, 95).- 3 AR 23 (1976-7) 17 fig. 36.

Profiles</page><page sequence="3">A MINOAN LARNAX FROM KNOSSOS 173 Cm FIG. 2. Animal head, front and side made of coarse gritty clay of reddish hue, with a grey core and white and grey inclusions, the surface prepared with a buff slip. The paint ranges from a smooth faint orange-red ochre to a thick flaking chocolate brown, owing to varying thicknesses of application and uneven firing. In places the paint is exceedingly fugitive, particularly on the 'west' side (FIG. 3; PLATE 29c). The upper rim of the larnax (d. 3.4 cm) has an everted lip with squared edge (2.3 cm). Both long sides have a raised central rib (6-7 cm wide). The division is not equal and exact centre on the preserved side (A, FIG. 4; PLATE 29a) is the right-hand edge of the rib. The larnax had two strap handles on each long side (c.12.5 x 8.4 cm) towards the upper edge on alignment with the panelled decoration near the sides. One on each side is fully preserved, a second on side A has broken off. Side A (FIGS. 4-5, 7; PLATES 22a-29a) is well preserved, but only fragments survive of side B (FIG. 10; PLATE 29b), mainly of the left half. Large sections of both short sides have survived (FIGS. 3, 9; PLATES 29c-d) enabling the larnax to be restored to its present condition. The larnax originally stood on four legs, though only one is fully preserved (7 x 13 cm) along with the corner of a second. The legs were hollow. Inside both feet, near the inside corner, is a hole in the clay. Only fragments of the base survive and it has not proved possible to reconstruct it. Several pieces have one or more holes (average diameter 0.8- I.o cm), one is near an edge but the majority of the surviving ten holes probably ran along the centre of the base; one fragment preserves two in alignment. Holes in the base and on the inside of the leg are common on Cretan larnakes. The usual explanation for these is that they enabled the body fluids to be drained away and served to</page><page sequence="4">174 LYVIA MORGAN speed decomposition by allowing air into the larnax.8 Four small holes also appear in the body of the larnax, two near the suspended plant behind the female figure to the left on side A, two beneath the handle (FIGS. 4-5). Such holes are common on LM III larnakes, frequently appearing in the upper outside edges of the panels where they sometimes match up with holes in the lid and must have served to attach the lid to the chest, a function evidently not applicable to the isolated holes on the Knossos larnax. Only a few fragments survive from the lid. Rim sherds have a distinct slope running to a blunt edge, body sherds a less pronounced slope, and top pieces a flat ridge. The lid was therefore of the gabled type, but, judging by the fragment in FIG. 2, with more rounded ends than some examples. Some of the pieces have paint, with straight and curved parallel lines, but insufficient survive to discern the pattern. The most informative piece is the animal head illustrated in FIG. 2, PLATE 3oa-b (three fragments joined; dimensions: chin to forehead 3.8 cm, width of head 4 cm, central ridge 4.1 cm wide; thickness of clay 2.2-4.1 cm). Faint traces of paint are visible around the neck and along the sides. The head would have projected over one of the ends, with its neck becoming the top ridge of the lid, as though the backbone of the animal and the backbone of the larnax were one and the same. From side view the 'neck' of the animal is hunched up before sloping back into the ridge, which at this point is slightly concave. From front view, the 'shoulders' of the animal have a rounded slope as they become the body of the larnax. The 'front' (i.e. the short side of the lid) is relatively flat. The head is hand modelled. The eyes are bulbous, the eyebrows project, and the area between brow and eye is depressed, as is the area behind the brows. The brow was probably pinched with finger and thumb and the depressions smoothed with the fingertip. The sides of the face appear to have been modelled from the front, drawing the clay back with the thumbs. The snout of the animal is chipped and the tip missing. The mouth is marked by an incised line. Small parallel striation marks around chin and left cheek suggest abrasion when the clay was dry. The face does not immediately suggest a particular animal. The placing of a modelled animal's head on one or both extremities of the central ridge of the lid occurs on other chest larnakes, but is not a common feature. A larnax from Dramia Apokoronou with polychrome decoration of animals, birds, and spirals has the modelled head of a horned animal on one extremity.9 A larnax from Metochi Kalou Herakleiou with abstract decoration has modelled animal heads on both extremities.10 The figured larnax from Episkopi lerapetras has a modelled bull's head on one end, overlooking animal scenes painted below." Three other larnakes from Episkopi have bulls' heads on both extremities of the lids,12 as, probably, has a larnax from Praissos.13 A larnax with rounded lid in the Agios Nikolaos Museum (No. 7459) has a modelled animal head on one end of the lid overlooking painted decoration of horns of consecration and a double axe. Another larnax in the same Museum has two modelled bulls' heads on one short side of the larnax body.14 With the exception of the first two, these larnakes come from East Crete. In each case, the head resembles that of a bull, with the exception of Agios Nikolaos No. 7459, which is none the less associated with sacrificial imagery. Mavriyannaki (who does not mention those in the Agios Nikolaos Museum) suggests that the heads are a reference to the sacrifice of bulls in honour of the 8 Bosanquet 1901I-2, 298; Evans 1906, 98; Michalidou- Papa 1972, 333f.; Crouwel 1983, 1 I, 12, and pl. 2. 9 Mavriyannaki 1972, 29-30 n. 38 with references.

In form it most closely resembles the head on Ayios Nikolaos No. 7459, but it is clearly uncanonical. Though the head is the physical extension of the ridge, it is no doubt significant that the animal overhung one of the short sides, for this is one of the focal positions for religious iconography on larnakes (see below). The painted decoration of the long sides is divided into two panels, separated by the central projecting ridge which is painted in both cases with a vertical pattern of retorted spirals. The better preserved side, A, has matching spirals in larger scale down each outer edge next to a pattern of wavy lines, the whole enclosing each figure of a woman within a frame (FIG. 4). The other long side also had panelled divisions, apparently less symmetrical in design (FIG. Io). The 'east' side frames the central motif with the same vertical spirals (FIG. 9), while the 'west' side frames the central motif with the pattern of wavy lines. Thus the narrower panel which makes up the end in each case has a framing device taken from the double design frames of side A. The 'west' side (FIG. 3; PLATE 29C) The 'west' side (to the left of side A) is fragmentary and, except at the top, the left edge is missing. What remains is fugitive in the extreme, the paint being barely visible. PLATE 29C shows the best photographic emulsion could do in recording the paint. In order to draw the design, the surface of the larnax was damped and the marks of paint slowly traced (upside down, as the restored larnax has no base). It was impossible to tell what would emerge until the drawing was complete and the image reversed to its natural position. FIGURE 3 is the result. In the centre of the field is a figure, framed by vertical wavy lines on the right and a similar design on the left. A reserved white line near the right edge appears to have run down into the leg, as does the identical feature at the adjoining edge of side A (FIG. 4). The outer edges of the better-preserved sides (FIGs. 4, 9) are symmetrical and we may suppose that on the west side the reserved line ran down both edges. However, the remaining patches of paint at the top left suggest a deviation in design. The whole is marked out as a single panel, with black lines framing top and bottom, the lower one serving as a base line for the figure. Two horizontal lines ran along the upper rim. Wavy lines, sometimes bordered by straight lines, are the dominant design element of several larnakes.16 On others, such lines are used as border elements for the edges of sides.17 The bordering of figured scenes with such lines is unusual. On pottery, wavy lines are a familiar feature of LM/LH IIIA.s18 Unfortunately, the extraordinary central form is too poorly preserved to be closely defined. The figure's head faces to the right. It is rounded at the back, narrowing into the neck, and the forehead is straight. No profile is preserved, and the only apparent feature to the face is an enormous reserved circular area which forms the eye. A comparable eye appears on the figures on the chariot larnax from Episkopi lerapetras (n. I I above). A reserved area also ran along the top and back of the head. A flame-like head-dress or projecting hair (literally on end) extends upwards and backwards from the top of the head in wavy parallel lines, those at the back joining at the ends. 15 Mavriyannaki 1972, 86. 16 e.g. Gypsades, Knossos: Hood and Huxley 1958-9, 231 fig. 24c pl. 6Ia.

'West' end</page><page sequence="7">A MINOAN LARNAX FROM KNOSSOS 177 The body, which is presumably in front view, appears to be in three parts. The top part is roughly circular and was probably painted solid except for a circular reserved centre which, like the eye, is then painted on the inside. Neither here nor in the eye is the circle exact or complete. The middle part of the body is narrower and appears to have been straight on the right side but curved on the left. It is filled with wavy parallel lines, some of which join, bordered by a horizontal line at the top with short thin parallel linesjoining this to the circular upper part of the body. The wavy lines resemble the dress patterns of the two women on side A (FIGS. 5, 7) and this section is likely to represent the upper part of the skirt. Two or three lines to the left of the main design may indicate a hand. The lower part of the body is almost entirely worn away, but fortunately enough survives of an outer curve to show that it was either circular, like the top, or bell-shaped, like a skirt. To the right of the figure is a vertical stick-like form, and to the right of that are five wavy lines which appear to extend towards the 'stick' from the framing device. The 'stick' is presumably a staffor spear. It is possible that the five wavy lines are actually fingers of a hand, but if so, they are eccentrically drawn. The figure appears to be wearing a small round shield in front of the upper part of the body, a central circle indicating the boss. This interpretation, however, is problematic, since the round shield is not known from representations prior to LH IIIB,19 a date too late for the larnax. None the less, the use of body armour, evidenced by the LH II Dendra corslet, must have made the long shields of earlier times redundant and, indeed, only one example of the rectangular 'tower' shield is known from LH III,20 while the figure-of-eight shield had by then taken on (perhaps solely) religious connotations. Though the round shield has not survived in the representations of LH/LM IIIA, it could conceivably have been in use during this time. On the other hand, it may be that the beginning of the curved form in the lower part of the body was the other half of a figure-of-eight shield, the centre curiously waisted and striped like the fabric of a dress. Bizarre though it sounds, this possibility cannot be excluded. The figure, with its large eye and upraised locks, is unique. As such, it is bound to be unexpected. The significance of this figure and its position on the larnax is discussed below. Side A (FIGs. 4, 5, 7; PLATES 27a-29a) Side A carries the main figurative scene and was surely intended as the front. The central raised ridge divides the space into two slightly unequal panels which are bordered on their outer edges by handles and vertical decoration. Outer borders and central ridge are decorated with retorted spirals, each of which ends in half concentric circles at the top and is bordered by reserved vertical lines (three below each handle, one elsewhere). Reserved crescents fill the interstices of the outer spiral patterns. Wavy bands complete the border designs, framing the two figures which occupy the centres of the two panels. Horizontal lines mark the upper rim of the larnax, as on the other sides. Traces of paint on the one preserved leg indicate a rectangle, but so fugitive is it that it is not entirely certain if it is dark on light or light on dark. The left-hand female figure has a wavy ground line beneath her, with a dark base band below that. The area below the other figure is not preserved. The women face towards the right, towards the 'east' side of the larnax. The woman on the left, behind the other, raises her hands to her forehead in a gesture of adoration (FIG. 5; PLATES 27a, 28a). Her hair projects on the top of her head in a series of loops, like a bunch of ribbons, then 19 See, e.g., Guida 1973, 46-9; also Buchholz and Wiesner 1977, E31 on the IIIC date of the majority of examples.

Papyrus plants, detail from LM IIIA larnax, Vasilika Anogeia. After Marinatos and Hirmer, Crete and Mycenae (London 1960) pl. 26 cascades down her back in wavy lines. Strands of 'hair' (cf. below) extend the other side, below her arm. Her eye is formed by an almond shape with central oval partially filled by the dark pupil which looks upward. An arc forms the eyebrow. Hands and feet are summarily drawn: the feet by two wavy and unjoined lines, the hands by a total of six thin lines, probably representing four (longer) fingers of the near hand and two (shorter) of the far hand with both held together in profile. (If the shorter lines were thumbs, the hands would be inverted, back to back.) Three fingers touch the forehead. The dress is not preserved in the centre and is difficult to follow in what survives. A series of flounces begins high up, shortly below the curve of the shoulder, which is seen in profile. At the bottom of the skirt is a pattern of wavy vertical lines contained within two semicircles, while similar lines appear higher up. These may represent a textile pattern but are perhaps better understood as the crinkling of the fabric as it gathers into flounces. The hem has a reserved border with wavy horizontal line. The majority of the upper part of the garment was probably filled in with the dark paint but only patches now survive. A reserved arc filled with short parallel lines runs from the left side of her body to her right, meeting the juncture of the arm. It is probably a midriff pattern similar to that on the figure to the right. The arms are seen in profile, the edges drawn in outline, the interiors filled with interspersed ovals with central horizontal lines. A line divides the two arms at the wrist and another does the same at the juncture of arms and body. If these two lines were joined the form would be comprehensible as two arms, each with oval patterns running from edge to edge. The ovals are therefore to be understood like those on the adjacent figure (FIG. 7). Rather too many and too regularly spaced for bracelets, they may represent a textile pattern or perhaps slits in the sleeves.21 An extraneous spiral floats buoyantly between neck and arm, joined to the latter. Behind the woman's head, pointing downwards, is a plant with central pointed oval and down-curving petals. The proportion of the plant in relation to the woman suggests a flower but the form most closely resembles the palm-tree motif. The down-curled petals or leaves are common to both lily and palm ceramic motifs. The former is sometimes depicted with three petaloid stamens, occasionally with one rather bulbous central one. The latter (minus its trunk) usually has a number of subsidiary leaves, but always has one dominant central leaf whose 21 I owe the latter suggestion to Dr Nicola Coldstream.</page><page sequence="11">A MINOAN LARNAX FROM KNOSSOS 181 FIG. 7. Detail: side A, right female figure</page><page sequence="12">182 LYVIA MORGAN proportion in relation to the outer down-curled leaves and whose shape match those of the plant on the larnax.22 In front of the woman, reaching down from the rim of the larnax is a pattern of parallel chevrons which end in a small spiriform line. Furumark argued that parallel chevrons (which constitute a ceramic motif occurring in LM/H IIB-IIIC but common in LM/H IIIAi-2) 'are found in connexions showing that they replace the Myc. III flower'.23 The hybrid 'Mycenaean flower' incorporates palm and papyrus units and the parallel chevrons are related to the latter. The chevron motif also functions as an angle-filling element on pottery. However, both the plant on the left and the chevrons on the right were conceived before the border decoration was painted, as the wavy vertical lines which frame the female figure terminate to leave space for the two features. Analogy with the other elements surrounding the two female figures (plants, bird, vessel) suggests that the chevrons should be representational and functional, and in the light of Furumark's analysis of the motif it too is perhaps to be understood as a plant. On Minoan larnakes, the papyrus plant with head composed of central stem and parallel chevrons is a familiar feature.24 On an LM liIA larnax from Vasilika Anogeia it occurs in association with waterfowl and fish (FIG. 6).25 The spiriform ends to the outer curled leaf/petal of the flowers on that larnax (on one side only of each flower) provide an explanation for the spiriform end to one side of the parallel chevrons on the Knossos larnax. In the right-hand panel stands the other female figure, taller than the first and with arms upraised (FIG. 7; PLATES 27b, 28b). The forehead and crown of her head are not preserved but projections at the top suggest short raised locks. Her hair waves down tojust below her shoulder where it ends. Longer wavy lines, like those to the right of the other woman, extend alongside her body from beneath her elbows. They are not connected to the hair above. Such wavy lines or disembodied locks of hair are paralleled on the Ayia Triada sarcophagus, where they occur on each of the processional and pouring figures on the side with the 'deceased' (FIG. I3). Three long wavy strands, painted in red, descend from both sides of the bodies of five of the figures and from one side of the sixth. In no case are the strands visibly attached to the hair, from which they are differentiated in colour. They descend from the region of the elbows and mid back. Mylonas takes them to be hair and suggests a funerary function.26 Long, however, not accepting that they are hair, calls them 'streamers', evoking the red taeniae attached to tombstones in Classical Greece as a possible explanation.27 She does, however, draw attention to similar (though not identical) lines attached to female figures on seal-stones where they are clearly hair, if not clearly funerary.28 If funerary, the Ayia Triada locks recall the Greek practice of tearing the hair in lamentation (portrayed in the hands to head gesture on Geometric pottery), the cutting of hair in mourning, and the offering of locks of hair at tombs following the burial.29 Wavy lines also project from the hips of female figures on one of the Tanagra larnakes. Though shorter and in a different position, these too were interpreted by Vermeule as hair cut off 22 Furumark, palm: motif 14 fig. 38.4 (HIA); cf. lily: motif 9, fig. 32k (IIB).

If a funerary interpretation were also applicable to the feature on the Knossos larnax, it would throw light on the function of that scene and in particular of that figure. The woman's eye is less symmetrical than that of her companion, with short lines on either side near the edge.31 Her pupil also looks upward and she too has an arched eyebrow. Her shoulders, arms, and dress are frontal while face and feet are in profile. The dress is of the same basic Minoan type as that of her companion, filled in with dark paint from the neck down, with flounced edges beginning high up under the arms and reaching to the ground. The hem has no border but the interior of the skirt is filled with vertical and horizontal wavy lines, divided into areas by straight lines. At the top of this pattern is an arc-shaped reserved area with internal short parallel lines, similar to that on the other woman but lower down. Above this is a pattern composed of groups of two curved reserved lines, convex at top and bottom, concave at the sides. Her upraised arms again have the oval shapes with central line this time interspersed with solid ovals. The reserved area of the arms is bordered by a thick dark line. Her right hand (our left) is not preserved but the sleeve has a dark cuff, while the other sleeve has a lined cuff or bracelets. Her left hand is preserved only in a small part, but appears to have been abbreviated, truncated digits rising from the wrist. To the woman's right, hovering in the air in front of her arm, is a funnel-shaped object (top not preserved) with a thick loop near the base like a handle, another thinner loop below, and an attenuated end. It should be a vessel, perhaps of leather(?), but the structure is without direct parallels. The lower loop might have been for hanging the vessel upside-down when not in use. In her right hand the woman held a plant of the same type as that which hangs behind her companion. In front of her and above, between her other hand and her head, is a bird. Stylized beyond ornithological recognition, the bird flies towards the left, its bill resting just above the woman's head. Its wings are partially outstretched (more, space would not allow), little lines indicating feathers extending from the bulbous wings. In the body is a reserved area filled with thin lines. It would suggest the folded wing were it not that the wings were already outstretched. The tail fans out behind with lined divisions, ending where the woman's hand should be. The lack of definition is unusual, the structure most closely resembles the bird flying amongst 'papyrus' plants on a LM IIIB bath-tub larnax from Milatos (FIG. 8).32 Birds appear on few other larnakes. They perch on double axes on the Ayia Triada sarcophagus and on larnakes from Mallia and Giofyrakia.33 They appear on a larnax with mixed iconography from Kavrochori Maleviziou, one of them disproportionately perched on top of a small stylized palm; they heraldically flank a palm on a larnax from Prevelianon Herakleiou and one of unknown provenance, and flank papyrus on another of unknown provenance; waterfowl appear amongst fish and papyrus on a larnax from Vasilika Anogeia.34 On these, and on the Milatos larnax, the birds are associated with vegetation.

After Zervos 1956, pl. 776 waterfowl, also adorn the lid of a larnax from Metochi Kalou Herakleiou, and appear on a bath-tub larnax from Tourloti.35 In Aegean (particularly Cretan) art, birds frequently appear associated with cult: they were amongst the cult objects of domestic sanctuaries, are shown on columns, altars, and horns of consecration, as well as on the arms and heads of female figures, notably the LM III idols from Knossos (Shrine of the Double Axes), Gazi, and Karphi.36 In these instances, their iconographic functions may have been to indicate the sanctity of a place or an event, or to evoke the presence of a deity (whether as an attribute or as a mediator). Their association with death and the world beyond may be glimpsed in the iconography of the Ayia Triada sarcophagus (discussed below) where they appear amidst cult paraphernalia before a female figure on both sides and watched by figures in a chariot on one of the ends, and in the modelled birds which perched on top of one of the larnakes from Tanagra.37 An association with death is reflected in the Ancient World in the winged soul-birds of Egyptian belief (the Ba) and of Greek belief (the psyche). Feathers painted on Egyptian coffins were intended to represent the wings of Isis and Nephthys as kites, appearing as divine mourners of the dead.38 Birds appear as 'filling motifs' in the prothethis scenes of Geometric urns, and it has been suggested that they too had a symbolic value 'serving as ideograms of funeral'.39 In the traditional funeral laments of modern Greece, the bird is a frequent image, functioning as a mediator between the worlds of the living and the dead, able to cross the boundary between the two through flight, and to bring messages from the underworld to those who mourn.40 The presence of the bird on the Knossos larnax, though it could have had an elementary function as an aspect of the natural world, may be similarly imbued with resonance. Associated with the woman with funerary(?) locks and upraised arms, watched by her as it hovers near her head, this bird may also have functioned as a mediator, whether between the world of human and divine or between the world of the living and the dead. 35 Metochi Kalou Herakleiou: Demopoulou-Rethemiotaki and Rethemiotakis 1978, pl.

'East' end The east side (FIG. 9; PLATE 29d) The short 'east' side is divided into three vertical zones. The tripartite division echoes that of the panels on side A, where each side is divided into central element (female figure) and bordering elements (spirals and lines), but on the short side, the central area has been shortened and the bordering spirals have been enlarged, giving equal weight to the three zones.</page><page sequence="16">186 LYVIA MORGAN Retorted spirals fill each border zone, with reserved crescents filling the interstices on the dark-filled background. The left spiral ends, as did those on side A, with semicircles at the top. The east side forms a bridge between the figurative and the abstract represented on its two adjacent sides. The central zone has a reserved background, like that of the three figures on the previous sides. Painted on to this is a stylized tree. The structure is repetitive, formed by a series of down-curled leaves (or petals) rising opposite one another along a central stalk. From the apex of each, where leaf meets stalk, rises a vegetal form whose upper edge curves around the downward curl of the leaf above, echoing its form in negative space. At the top, the vegetal form rises centrally and massively to merge into the upper border. The form is related to the 'waz' lily, the centre split and repeated to create a chain. This is no plant from nature but a ceramic motif of vegetal origin evoking the image of a tree. The tree motif is related to the 'lily-chain' of LM I-LM IIIA pottery. It appears, bordered by linear designs, on an LM IIIA2 amphora from Arkasa, Karpathos (PLATE 3OC).41 One side is painted with joined spirals, the other with a tricurved arch net pattern; between the two, in a vertical zone beneath the handle, is a repetitive tree-like form composed of spiriform 'leaves'. From side view, the overall design is of tree bordered by spirals to left, tricurved arches to right. On the larnax, the tree is bordered by spirals on both sides and the first motif around the right corner, on side B, is that of the tricurved arch. The form of the Karpathos tree motif is directly paralleled on one of the short ends of a larnax of unknown provenance in the Rethymnon Museum.42 The two sides are painted with heraldic waterfowl flanking papyrus plants. On one side a zone of horns of consecration lies beneath the birds. If one takes that side to be the front, then the tree motif, as on the Knossos larnax, occurs on the 'east' end. Trees on other larnakes are identifiable as palm. They occur in isolation on each of the ends (larnax of unknown provenance), covering a larnax in rows (Gazi), associated with birds (Prevelianon Herakleiou, Kavrochori Maleviziou, and unknown provenance), and amongst other vegetation (Maroulas Rethymnis).43 Palm-trees also appear associated with an animal (end) and a chariot scene (front) on a larnax in the Herakleion Museum (n. 75 below) and associated with animals on the lid of the figured larnax from Episkopi Hierapetras (n. II above). The tree, universally employed as a symbol of life and regeneration in the Ancient World, also had specific associations with death in Greek thought. In antiquity, just as in modern Greek funeral laments, analogies were drawn between the various stages of growth and decay in human life and the stages of the life-cycle of the tree.44 The knowledge that growth and decay form a circular process in plant life no doubt gave sustenance to the human need for continuance. Had Aegean culture such a concept, the tree would be a fitting symbol for a larnax. And were it such a symbol, its position on the end of this larnax, at the culminating point of the procession of women, would be appropriate. 41 Zachariadou 1978, 263-4 pl. 78a-y, 6869.

The designs are abstract. The central raised ridge separating the two panels is painted with vertical retorted sprials, like the corresponding ridge on the other side. Vertical lines and cresents border the spirals. The crescents lie closer to one another than in the other examples and are formed by the space which is left between the wavy line of dark paint surrounding the spirals and a dark vertical line. (One is here confronted with a gestalt choice of seeing and describing the pattern as dark on light (dark wavy area, dark lines) or as light on dark (reserved crescents).) The main panel decoration is in both cases spiriform and anomalous. That on the right is preserved only in fragments. Appearance suggests a series of free-floating spirals veering to the left, but originally they would have been intricately connected. Were the panel the same size as the other, the point from which the spirals rise would be exact centre. We may therefore deduce that the composition was symmetrical, spirals veering in both directions, forming pairs along a central stem. Starting from the central stem, following the dark line, the second spiral up becomes a retorted spiral which leads into the spiral above which ends back at the central stem. The lowest spiral ends (or begins) at its own centre and is therefore independent as, perhaps, was that at the top. In between the spirals lies a dark filled-in area, whose concave outer edge merges with the line of the spiral. Mentally detach the shape and it becomes the vegetal form which on the tree on the 'east' side echoes the curls of the leaves. The artist has combined the forms of the retorted spiral with those of the 'tree', linking the curve of the two in the mind's eye. The comparison only works at the angle at which these particular spirals have been drawn. Imagine the other half of this panel in a mirror image and the structure of the composition becomes that of a 'tree' composed of spirals. It is a visual play of forms but not, I suspect, one which carries a message beyond that of the artist's virtuosity. The left-hand panel is preserved only in the upper half. Two running spirals, possiblyjoined at the top, end irretrievably at their own centres. On its side to the right lies a wishbone shape, dark on light like the spirals. The left-hand spiral appears to have carried through across the field to the lower right, joining, no doubt, another of its kind. Insufficient is preserved of the lower half to conjecture further. The panel is bordered on the right by the central ridge and on the left in the area of the handle by a vertical zone of parallel lines. To the left of this is another zone, filled with the pattern known as the tricurved arched net.45 A familiar ceramic motif of LM/LH III, this pattern occurs earlier in other media as a sign indicating 'sea'.46 The tricurved arch pattern covers entire sides of larnakes from Archanes, Ligortino, and Kavrochori Maleviziou; it appears in two vertical columns on one-half of a side on a larnax from Episkopi lerapetra; and it appears in variant form on the two border zones of a side on a larnax from Zapher Papoura, Knossos.47 Such symmetrical bordering probably applied to the Knossos larnax as well, though the right half of side B is not preserved. Normally, the structure is repeated in ever expanding form, the two lower curved lines becoming the left and right upper curved lines of the adjacent arches.

Side B</page><page sequence="19">A MINOAN LARNAX FROM KNOSSOS 189 larnax the pattern occurs in a single narrow zone and each structure is independent. The filling motif in ceramic examples takes a number of shapes, notably papyriform. Here the fill of the upper arch takes a simple shape which echoes the curve of the exterior lines above. It is similar to the form which appears in the 'sea' sign. The fill line of the lower arch terminates midway, bifurcating at the end. This structure is related to the sign for 'water' which was developed in the rivers and coasts of the Theran wall-paintings and transmitted to LM IB pottery where it occurs in association with riverine plants.48 Here, at a later date, it is divorced from its aquatic context but is none the less appropriately placed within a structure which originally held the significance 'sea'. Though the two parts of the structure are consistent in themselves, there is nothing in the iconographic context of the larnax to suggest that it is being used here as anything other than a subsidiary abstract element. The rim of side B differs slightly from those of the other sides in having two rather than three dark bands, the upper one with irregularly reserved triangles, more rounded versions of which appear at the tops of the panel and border zones below. DISCUSSION If, in anthropomorphic partiality, one takes the figures to be the primary iconographic elements, there appears to have been a main side or front with its figured scene and a subsidiary side or back with abstract designs. The short sides have one figured scene and one part abstract, part representational. The spirals The dominant design element is the spiral. It centrally divides the painted panels on both long sides; it borders both female figures of side A and also the tree on the 'east' side. On side B, it takes, in variant forms, the primary positions within the panels. All but the last conform to a retorted structure, while side B includes the simpler running spiral. The retorted spiral is potentially infinite. It can be formed in a single stroke without lifting the brush from the surface, the line turning to run parallel to itself at the centre, moving continuously forward, the end of the last becoming the beginning of the next. The running spiral, in contrast, has a beginning and an end. It starts at a point in the centre and moves outward until the outer line changes the direction of its movement to turn inwards into the following spiral which ends, as the other began, at the centre. On the larnax the surrounding areas of the retorted spiral are blocked out in black. This presents the viewer with a gestalt choice between figure/ground: between seeing a thin, black retorted spiral on a white ground; or thick white running spirals, composed of interlock- ing S shapes bordered in black. Spirals occur on virtually every medium in Aegean art. On Late Minoan, as on Late Helladic, pottery the running spiral is more common than the retorted spiral, though both have a long ancestry.49 The retorted spiral occurs mainly in LM I-IIIAI and may well not have outlived that stage. On larnakes, running spirals are a common motif. They cover the surface of one or 48 Morgan 1984, 172-3 figs. 3-4. 49 Running spiral: Furumark, motif 46 figs. 59, 60 (Mycen- aean).

Knossos side B),50 or run down the narrow surface of the outer borders and/or the central ridge (cf. Side A and the 'east' side for positions).51 Retorted spirals appear down the borders of the front and back of the Ayia Triada sarcophagus, framing the figured scenes (PLATE 3Oe, cf. Knossos side A). Each spiral, marked by a rosette at the centre, is picked out in blue and white. The use of polychrome encouraged the artist to see the spirals in terms of a series of continuous S shapes. Crescents, formed in the negative space (cf. Knossos) are picked out through the use of colours. Similar spirals mark the surfaces of the 'tomb' structure behind the deceased, and the altar (or stand) and shrine on the other side (PLATE 3od). Perhaps they mark the significance of these structures. The coincidence of retorted spirals as border designs on the Knossos larnax and the Ayia Triada sarcophagus may reflect an artistic connection between the two, as suggested also by the figures (below). Alternatively, it may reflect an iconographic connection. Retorted spirals, with their potentially infinite structure, recur on three of the sides of the Knossos larnax, predominating on front and 'east'. Since the spiral resembles no physical object and our culture knows no meaning for this form of visual patterning we call it abstract. But the continuity of structure which it, and it alone of design elements, entails should at least alert us to the possibility of the signification of continuance or perpetuity. The figures: comparanda Only the 'west' side has no spirals, wavy lines instead bordering the central apparition, a figure holding a staff/spear, who appears to be wearing a shield. The image of a figure holding a staff or spear vertically in front of the body is paralleled: (i) by the priestly warrior(?) accompanied by a lion on one of the Knossos Temple Repositories sealings;52 (2) by a warrior in figure-of-eight shield on a sealing from Knossos;53 (3) by the woman on a mountain on the Knossos Columnar Shrine ring impressions;54 (4) by the right-hand boy on the Chieftan's Cup;55 (5) by the man holding a spear before a palm-tree on a seal from Naxos;56 (6) by one of the men taking part in the Meeting on the Hill in the Theran miniature paintings;57 (7) by a male votary standing before a seated female on a gold ring from Mycenae;58 and (8) by the woman in a fringed skirt from the wall-painting from the Shrine of Taylor's excavations at Mycenae, before whom is what appears to be a massive sword.59 In three, perhaps four, cases the object is a spear (i), (2), (5), and (4), in three it is a staff (3), (6), and (7), once it is a sword (8). The gesture is adopted in a supplicatory or deferential manner in one example (7), possibly in two others (5) and (6), and is a gesture of power in two, perhaps three, examples (3), (4), and (8). With the exception of the abbreviated scenes in (I) and (2), the iconographic context in each case indicates a cult scene. The extraordinary figure on the larnax, with its otherworldly head, its body clad half in skirt, half it appears in shield, and its staff or spear in front, is surely not intended to be read as human.

Mycenae has yielded the primary evidence for this 'warrior goddess': the painted plaque with a female figure holding a sword and wearing a figure-of-eight shield from Tsountas's excavations;60 the fresco fragment of a female figure wearing a helmet and carrying a miniature griffin from Mylonas's excavations;61 the shrine painting of a female figure and sword from Taylor's excavations (n. 59 above); and the Acropolis Treasure ring with a diminutive figure-of-eight personage with spear placed in the field above two women and a girl making offerings to a seated female figure (FIG. II).62 The paintings and plaque come from LH IIIB contexts, the ring is usually dated to LH II. Recently, P. Rehak has drawn attention to forerunners of the theme of armed or armoured females in an LM I rectangular seal from Knossos, an LH II seal in the British Museum, and the helmeted female figure of the Zakro sealings, and argues that the 'warrior goddess' was not exclusively Mycenaean (n. 6o above). One might also cite the LM IB cup rhyton from Warren's Stratigraphical Museum excavations at Knossos, on which figure-of-eight shields are drawn alongside a monstrous head or 'gorgoneion',63 as relevant to the early appearance on Crete of a superhuman being associated with warfare. Figures, human or divine, are rare on Cretan larnakes, whose subjects are more often drawn from the natural world of animals and plants or from the sinuous patterns of contemporary pottery. With the exception of the Ayia Triada sarcophagus, on which two figures are conveyed by chariot on each short side,64 the few examples in which a short side bears the image of a figure show only one such personage on one side only. From Milatos Mirabello comes a chest larnax whose long sides are decorated with foliage patterns, fish, and wavy lines, and with a human figure on one end.65 The figure, identified by Evans as male, by Alexiou as female, faces towards the right (head and feet) with both arms raised (frontally). In front, touched, perhaps held, by the left hand, is a curved object which Evans called a shield, though Alexiou saw it as rocks or a large amphora.6 The figure is either holding the object or raising both arms to it. From Vathianos Kambos (Niroukhani Pediadhos) comes a chest larnax decorated with argonaut and papyrus on each long side, a linear design on one short side, and a figure with upraised arms on the other.67 The figure is swathed in a knee-length garment; the arms are frontal, but head and feet face to the right. From Armenoi Rethymnis comes a chest larnax with a figure on one short side standing on a chequered 'plinth'. The figure is highly schematized with spirals dangling from the elbows, but appears to be female and has upraised arms. Her head faces towards the left.68 The figured larnax from Episkopi lerapetras has a small nude female figure modelled in clay, perched on the end of the ridge of the lid overlooking one of the short sides (the opposite end to the modelled bull's head) (n. IXI above). The painted figures are usually thought to represent deities.69 The end may have been considered the appropriate position for a divine protector of the dead, particularly if the body of 60 C.

The closest parallel for the idiom is the Ayia Triada sarcophagus. Both have more in common with the figures of wall-paintings than of those which appear on larnakes. While, however, the entire decoration of the Ayia Triada sarcophagus recalls that of mural painting," the Knossos larnax surrounds the women with motifs drawn from contemporary pottery. The Ayia Triada sarcophagus provides the only parallel for female figures on the long side of a larnax amongst those published from Crete. It also provides the only parallel for a procession of figures on a Cretan larnax. The sarcophagus is datable to LM IIIAI, contemporary with the Knossos larnax and earlier than the other figured larnakes from Crete (LM IIIA2-LM IIIB). The few other published instances in which human figures appear on one of the long sides present the theme of men and animals. The Episkopi lerapetras larnax has a chariot scene and men and animals on the front and lid; animals and trees appear on the other sides (n. i i above). A chariot scene appears on a side of a larnax from Zapher Papoura, while the other side is painted with men hunting wild goats.72 The theme of man as hunter appears on the fronts of two larnakes from Armenoi; creatures of land, sea, and air fill the other sides of one, horns of consecration with double axes appear on the other.3 A larnax from Maroulas repeats the theme of hunter with wounded animal on one short side; antithetic loops decorate the sides.4 A hunter (end) and a chariot scene (front) also appear on a larnax in the Herakleion Museum, amid a complex of images.75 A tiny figure appears with a bird on the front ofa larnax in the Rethymnon Museum. A cult scene with a schematized figure raising his arms to horns of consecration appears on the front of a larnax in the Chania Museum, probably the one from Apodhoulou Amariou referred to in publications.76 On all these larnakes, the figures appear to be male, all but one of whom (Chania Museum) are associated with animals and/or hunting. Only the last has an explicit ritual denotation. The Ayia Triada sarcophagus remains unique in the specificity of its funerary iconography. However, a funerary significance has also been suggested for the chariot scenes from Episkopi lerapetras and Zapher Papoura. A number of Cretan larnakes await publication and no doubt the picture of Cretan funerary iconography will expand with their appearance. An unpublished larnax from Pigi in the Chania Museum is reported as having a scene of the dead man flanked by mourning figures (prothesis).77 Funerary scenes, rare though they be on Crete, form the staple iconography of the Mycenaean larnakes from Tanagra.78 Though echoes of Cretan models can occasionally be detected,79 on the whole these larnakes are distinctly local Mycenaean. Vividly painted figured scenes appear on the majority of those published, often with a clearly funerary significance. The o70 Evans 1906, 99.

The single figures on the larnakes from Vathianos Kambos, Armenoi, Milatos, and Maroulas show that on those larnakes one of the ends held the most potent image. On the other hand, the scenes with human figures on the larnakes from Episkopi Ierapetras, Zapher Papoura, Armenoi, and Apodoulou Amariou appear on one long side-the front. Only one larnax (Herakleion Museum) has a figure on both a side and an end. The Knossos larnax employs both alternatives. The larger space afforded by one of the long sides is used for the more complex narrative scene involving human action, while the short sides appear to have been reserved for images of particularly potent allusion: the deity itself perhaps and an object venerated within the cult, the tree of 'life'.

The back of the larnax, with its abstract patterning, appears to stop the progression so that one imagines the end, front, end-apparition to tree-as a single unfolding sequence, finite in its intention. Seen in this way, an unlikely parallel may be found in the gold ring from the Acropolis at Mycenae in FIG. I I (n. 62 above). 'Hovering' in the space upper left (in the impression) is a small apparition with figure-of- eight shield and out-held spear or staff; it faces to the right. Below and to the right are two female figures and a small girl wearing flounced skirts; each bears flowers and one has delivered hers to the recipient seated in front. The seated figure-usually taken to be a goddess-is placed in front of a tree. There are of course subsidiary elements, but concentrating on the main ones, the sequence reiterates that of the larnax: procession of women with plants, apparition with shield and staff behind (or above), all facing towards a tree. On the ring the sequence is complemented by the appearance of the 'goddess' in association with the tree. The standing female figures are clearly votaries, presumably priestly. The figure with shield appears to be a reference rather than an integral part of the scene, hence the diminutive size and the position. It may be a reference to a warrior deity, perhaps tho 'shield goddess' who appears in the later paintings at Mycenae. The goddess in front of the tree is the culminating point in the progression of the scene, and the importance of vegetation in the proceedings is signalled by the handling of plants by the female figures. On the larnax, the female figures are related to one another in dress and each is associated with a plant. But their gestures differ and one has the further attributes of bird and vessel. The gestures of the women must be seen in relation to the tree, towards which they move.</page><page sequence="25">A MINOAN LARNAX FROM KNOSSOS 195 FIG. 12. Sealstone, Knossos. CMS II (3) no. 17 Though unique amongst larnakes, the theme of two or three women moving towards a tree and/or shrine is recurrent in Aegean glyptic art (FIGS. I2-I3).91 (Occasionally the scene is abbreviated to the women, with or without token plants in the surrounding field.) In some cases, the women carry plants as offerings.92 On a seal from Midea, birds fly within the shrine (FIG. 13).93 On a seal from Mycenae, figure-of-eight shields appear beside the figures.94 The usual gesture of the women is of one arm raised towards the head, the other hanging loosely by the woman's side. On a gold ring from Mycenae, two women adopt the precise gesture of the left-hand figure on the larnax-fingers outstretched to the forehead-as they heraldically flank a shrine with vegetation (FIG. 14).95 The upraised arms gesture (both arms shown frontally, as on the right-hand figure on the larnax) is encountered in a sealing from Ayia Triada on which two women with upraised arms flank a central tree (FIG. 15).96 It is also adopted by one of the women on the Isopata ring97 (left in the impression).

CMS I no. 179 gesture (frontal view) and the two to the right stretch their arms upwards. Alexiou took the left-hand figure with upraised arms to be a goddess, Nilsson took her to be a dancer.98 The gesture of raising the arms upwards can take on widely differing meanings dependent upon small changes of attitude. Any of the permutations could presumably be applied to dance, but some are more specific. Two hands raised to the head, as on the Tanagra larnakes and on Geometric funerary scenes, signifies mourning: tearing the hair in lamentation.99 One hand raised to the forehead is usually interpreted as votive.100 Both arms raised with palms held frontally is a well-known gesture ofLM III, particularly applied to terracotta figures. Following Alexiou, the holder of such a gesture is usually referred to as the 'goddess with upraised arms'.10' But can the figure with upraised arms on the larnax be a goddess if the other figure, who stands behind her and faces in the same direction, is a votary? One would surely expect the goddess to receive the votive gesture, not turn her back to it. The figure's attributes are plant, bird, and vessel and she faces towards the tree. As noted above, the only parallel for female figures on the long side of a larnax from Crete is the Ayia Triada sarcophagus. On one side-the side with male offering-bearers before the image of the deceased illustrated in PLATE 3Oe-the foremost woman in the procession on the left empties the contents of a vessel into a cauldron set between mounted double axes. On top of the double axes, one of which is near the woman's head, is a bird. The woman has 'funerary(?) locks' descending below her arm. On the other side-the scene with the animal sacrifice-the foremost woman on the right looks up towards another bird perched on a double axe, and has in front of her a bowl and a jug (PLATE 3od). In front of these is a shrine with horns of consecration and a 98 Alexiou 1958, 237; also I. Pini and N. Platon, CMS II (3) pp. 61-2. Nilsson 1950, 279-80. 99 Vermeule 1965, 142-3; 1979, 63 n. 46.

On one side, the procession ends at a shrine with a tree; on the other side, the left-hand procession ends in the pouring of liquid while the right-hand procession ends with the deceased who stands behind a tree. Watering the tree (or branch) is an activity which on seal-stones is undertaken by daemons, acolytes of other-worldly appearance.103 On the daemon ring from Tiryns, four of these acolytes bring jugs to a seated female figure (FIG. I6).104 Between each is a branch, an abbreviation for a tree. The figure, presumably the goddess again, holds out to them a vessel, while behind her chair perches a bird. On the Ayia Triada sarcophagus the bird and vessel are associated with the foremost priestess of the ritual, the bird perhaps as a mediator between this world and the other. On the Tiryns ring the bird and vessel are associated with the goddess herself, though vessels too are brought to her. On the ring from the Mycenae Acropolis the two elements at the terminal point of the procession and hence the recipients of the offerings-the seated goddess (Tiryns ring) and the tree (A. Triada sarcophagus) -appear together. On the larnax, two female figures with plants (offerings) move towards the right. One has her hands in a votive gesture. The other has her hands in a gesture usually attributed to goddesses and is associated with a bird and a vessel. In front of both, on the next side, is the tree. I suggest that the two women are priestesses, the one on the right of higher standing in the religious ritual than the other. The one with arms raised to forehead is a votary who brings plants as offerings (shown above). The one in front, with upraised arms brings a plant too but her role demands a more active part in the ritual and she also brings a vessel, probably for the watering of the tree. The bird, unless it alludes to the natural world over which the deity presides, may function as a mediator between human and divine or between living and dead. The raised arms gesture, which is usually interpreted as indicative of the status of deity, is perhaps adopted here by the principal priestess as she simulates the posture of the deity in the culmination of the ritual. The procession has moved to its terminal point at the 'east' end with the image of the tree. The tree is, therefore, in the position of veneration: the embodiment of that over which the deity presides-the natural world-and an image redolent of life. Though the focus of attention is concentrated on the two women on the front of the larnax, we have seen that religious symbolism is frequently reserved for the short ends of Minoan larnakes. Not least, the image of the deity itself appears to have been restricted to one of the ends. The extraordinary apparition on the 'west' end may be a protective warrior deity, who, like Athena in later iconography, stands guard behind the proceedings. A further possible interpretation arises from the funerary context. Though the fragments of the larnax had been widely dispersed, the majority were found placed in niche 2 in the dromos of the tomb. The front of the niche, in running parallel with the direction of the entrance to the tomb ran west-east. Though by no means in situ, this orientation raises the question of the original position of the larnax and the consequent viewpoint of the scenes for those involved in the burial rites. Unfortunately, now, it is a question that cannot be answered. But had the larnax lain in the orientation in which it was found, then the 'warrior apparition', even as a protective deity an image suggestive of death and destruction, would have appeared to the west, the side of the setting sun and the world outside, while the tree, an image of life and growth, would have appeared to the east, the side of the rising sun and the interior of the tomb. The women, bearing plants and the means to nurture vegetation-the vessel-move from the west to the east, from 102 Side I: Long 1974, pls. 6, 15, 19; Marinatos and Hirmer, colour pls. xxvii, xxixA.

Seen in these terms the sequence would suggest a ritual movement on the part of the women towards the interior of the tomb (which may actually have taken place outside towards the entrance to the tomb) and a symbolic movement towards regeneration, from death to life, a dual sequence applicable to the funerary function of the larnax.
