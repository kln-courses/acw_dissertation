<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  ReviewS | 489 While Tariq and other asylum seekers have compelling and detailed accounts  told, the book should not be seen as a colourful and graphic collection of their  lives. It is a scholarly work of significance and is thoroughly researched. For ex- ample, in a chapter on the Australia-Indonesia relationship one is struck by the  amount of funds spent on “border security”—au$7.9 million in 2008 to develop  Indonesia’s “border movement alert system”; au$86.8 million in 2014 (over three  years) as part of a “regional cooperation agreement to manage asylum seekers liv- ing in the archipelago” (195), and many more.  While this might be seen as an Australia-centric problem, politicians claiming to  be “tough” on asylum seekers in transit countries is an issue not only relevant to  Australia. In the wake of photos of dead Syrian children being washed up on shores,  newly deposed Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott urged leaders in Europe to  adopt his tough border protection policies, including turning back boats, because it  saved lives. While the politically sensitive issue of asylum seekers coming to Australia  by boat existed long before Abbott’s reign, Missbach describes his “regime” as go- ing “from bad to worse” when it came to asylum seeker policies (191).  This book would be a crucial resource for scholars, government officials, and  global humanitarian organizations devoted to migration. In addition, anyone in- terested in the Australia-Indonesia relationship should be urged to read it. Given  the polarization and often uninformed commentary on asylum seekers travelling  from Indonesia to Australia, Missbach’s book provides a thorough, precise, and  deeply researched scholarly analysis. But the most engaging aspects of the book  remain the voices of those previously underrepresented in scholarly and media ac- counts of transit migrants. Their stories give a sense of the effect transit migration  will have on their lives even beyond the years they were “stuck” in Indonesia. As  one Iraqi asylum seeker quoted in the book says (240): “Every country has its own  method of torture. In Iraq they use bullets, in Indonesia it is the discrimination  by organizations and their regulations. Night and day they say we are criminals,  illegals, this was more painful than a bullet to your head.” Ross Tapsell  The Australian National University  Gaudenz Domenig, Religion and Architecture in Premodern  Indonesia: Studies in Spatial Anthropology Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2014. xviii+ 576 pages.

ViSiTORS TO THe highland regions of Sumatra and Sulawesi in Indonesia have long  been impressed with the flamboyance of certain local architectural traditions. Par- ticular attention has been drawn to the dramatic sweeping roof lines of traditional  Batak, Minangkabau, and Toraja houses. So emblematic of ethnic identity have  </page> <page sequence="2"> 490 | Asian Ethnology 75/2 • 2016 these roofs become that you can see them invoked on everything from Padang  restaurants and Christian churches to New Order-era monuments and contempo- rary tourist carvings. They have prompted all sorts of speculations ranging from  the more plausible (memories of ancestral ships) to less so (evidence of extrater- restrial visitors) but also serious research by scholars such as Roxanne Waterson  and James Fox. Less well known but also remarkable structures are found in vari- ous parts of Nusa Tenggara Timur (nTT), East Timor, Maluku, and Kalimantan.  The attention these buildings have drawn is disproportionate to the relative scale  of the societies that produce them, most of which are quite small and histori- cally isolated. Although nearly 60 percent of Indonesia’s population lives on Java,  dwellings there have received little scholarly notice by comparison. One reason  for this disproportion is simply the exotic character of the former, against which  even traditional Javanese houses can seem quite familiar, their design principles  functionally straightforward to Western eyes and therefore requiring no particular  investigation. By contrast, the exuberance of Batak and Toraja houses, to men- tion the best known, seems to reach far beyond anything that can be explained in  terms of shelter or comfort. Another reason for the special attention they receive  lies in an old scholarly habit of seeking evidence of archaic traditions and origins  among the present-day inhabitants of societies scattered around the edges of the  densely populated Muslim populations of the irrigated rice-growing lowlands. The  notion that some societies preserve the past as if they had been frozen in time has  long since been discredited among anthropologists. But, rather like James Scott’s  “Zomia,” inhabitants of some of the highlands and smaller islands do have certain  things in common. They managed to elude the more direct forms of state power  during much of their history, and have often relied on what ScOTT calls “escape  agriculture,” (2009) such as swiddening, to remain mobile. Some of them also  share certain distinctive features, such as asymmetric marriage systems, social or- ganization along the lines of “house societies,” and, in certain places, have resisted  the major religious forces that swept the rest of the archipelago. And then there  are those houses. Despite the 1,500 miles distance between the Toraja and Batak  homelands, for instance, their rooflines are strikingly similar.  Religion and Architecture in Premodern Indonesia is an ambitious effort to explain  these houses, the culmination of decades of what was clearly exacting research and  imaginative reflection. Although, as noted, important books on the topic precede it,  this monograph is remarkable both for its thoroughness and the distinctive perspec- tive its author brings to the topic. An architect by training, Domenig has a sharp eye  for detail, and the evidence it offers for construction techniques and the way builders  solve engineering problems. This volume weighs in at over 500 pages, generously  provided with 385 illustrations. The author seems to have scrutinized every picture,  diagram, model, and written account on the subject, and has visited many of the  places in person. His technical discussions of everything from the cantilevering of  floors to the vulnerabilities of roof plates are painstaking in their precision. As an  encyclopedic record and formal analysis, this book will serve as a reference work on  these architectural traditions that we are not likely to see surpassed any time soon—it  is a testimony to the kind of projects that only institutions like the kiTLv can support. </page> <page sequence="3">  ReviewS | 491 The book’s eleven chapters work from the ground up. Beginning with what the  author calls “landtaking rites,” it proceeds to look by turns at sacred groves, the  spatial location of the spirits, and the function of decorations on altars and other  structures, before then moving into the house itself, and culminates in an exhaus- tive discussion of roofs over five chapters. (Perhaps this interest in roofs explains  the relative lack of attention paid to the famous longhouses of Borneo, whose roof- lines are mundane by comparison.) This sequence reflects the overarching concern  of the book, to reconstruct a hypothetical religious logic and developmental se- quence underlying the design principles of these various architectural traditions.  Thus what the book’s subtitle calls “spatial anthropology” is really about some- thing more specific, namely, spatial relations between humans and spirits. In line  with this focus, the volume makes no mention of important work in the anthro- pology of space, such as that of Nancy Munn, Fred Myers, or even the pioneering  writings of Durkheim and Mauss, and has relatively little to say about the overall  layout of villages or the spaces between them.  At the heart of the argument is the claim that the puzzling design features of  these houses can be understood as working to bring spirits down from the sky and  into proximity to the living. As Domenig summarizes his thesis, Indonesian archi- tecture was traditionally “a means of safeguarding the friendship and benevolence  of gods and spirits by inviting them to the house and guiding them to offerings  presented there” (16). Favoring as it does religious over purely utilitarian reason- ing, this argument has a long tradition behind it, going back at least to Fustel de  Coulanges’s 1864 masterpiece, The Ancient City. One contribution of this book  is the effort to shed light on puzzling or hitherto overlooked structural details.  For instance, Domenig notices that certain kinds of decoration are likely to move  in a breeze, animating an altar or house in ways that are not obvious in still pho- tography. I was especially taken with his injunction that “we must try to imagine  how a structure may have looked under different weather conditions” (166). But  Domenig is especially interested in those unusual roofs, which more than any other  features of the house seem to cry out for an explanation beyond mere functionality.  Of certain sorts of projecting gable finials, for instance, he writes “by literally tran- scending the roof they rather contradict or qualify the rigid finiteness of the apex  and provide and aspect of play, of freedom and of life” (428). An entire chapter is  devoted to the instability of the roofs. It might seem that flexible roofs better with- stand earthquakes and storms than rigid ones (I vividly recall being hustled out of  a house in Sumba during a windstorm that my hosts feared would carry our roof  away). Domenig, however, pushes beyond such utilitarian explanations to propose  that movements of a roof were seen as spiritually auspicious. Suggestions like these  will make anyone familiar with these structures view them with fresh eyes. As a contribution to the anthropology of architecture, the book is truly remark- able. As a work in the anthropology of religion, however, it is rather less persuasive.  As a scholarly approach, Domenig’s unapologetically speculative reconstructions  hearken back to the era of the nineteenth century travelers and missionaries whose  texts he favors, on the grounds that their records take us closer to the lost pre- modern world. To be sure, anthropology has a healthy tolerance for some degree  </page> <page sequence="4"> 492 | Asian Ethnology 75/2 • 2016 of speculation. But the approach taken here more or less tacitly assumes several  things that most anthropologists today would hesitate to take on board: first, that  across the archipelago there was once a more or less shared religious logic; second,  that this logic was once a coherent and systematic totality; third, that over time  the system changed following a clear developmental sequence, but, fourth, all that  remains of this system today are fragments whose meanings have been forgotten by  living people; and fifth, that the forgotten system can be reconstructed by fitting  together bits and pieces of evidence that have been selected from various localities  across the region (and even at times, rather inexplicably, from places as far flung as  Thailand, Iceland, Japan, and ancient Greece). And of course this approach means  ignoring most of the archipelago in favor of certain societies thought to be closest  to the past. The idea that all that remains of that past are remnants of a thought- world that was once shared across the region and internally coherent leads the  author at times to override the ethnographic testimony of living people—if the  locals’ interpretations differ from the author’s own, that is because the locals no  longer remember their original meanings. Given that living people often still build  these houses, and in some cases still practice the rituals that go with them, this  dismissal is, at the very least, methodologically problematic. For instance, since the  theory requires that the projections atop Sumbanese houses are “actually” spirit  ladders (263), it leads the author to override the fact that their present-day build- ers call them “house horns”—even though Sumbanese also stack up real buffalo  horns on the veranda, carve them on tombs and altars, and give their shape to  dancers’ head ornaments. Since the theory literally directs our attention upwards,  we rarely get inside the houses enough to see what it’s like to actually live in them,  to explore the religious implications of huddling in the nurturing comfort of dark  spaces and glowing hearths, or of the spatial divisions between eating and sleeping,  guests and hosts, men and women, young and old. The focus is on the house as an  architectural unit, affording only selective discussion of settlement patterns, plazas,  and tombs, and the surrounding gardens and pastures. Although there’s a nice  detail about rats being identified with ancestors—summoning back some chilling  fieldwork memories of my own—we hear little of the domestic animals that often  live under the house, whose presence there is sometimes invoked in local cosmolo- gies. And there is relatively little description of actual rituals, compared to those  the author postulates must once have occurred. Given the lack of direct evidence,  the reconstructions of forgotten religion often follow what E. E. Evans-Pritchard  derided long ago as the “if I were a horse” method.  And then there’s the question of the “premodern.” If the people who construct  and inhabit these houses today cannot be trusted to understand their original mean- ings, when exactly was that time when they did get them right, when the parts did  fit together? An approach that assumes we are reconstructing a lost whole from its  scattered fragments gives the author permission to accept or reject the ethnographic  evidence. And, yes, sometimes one does have to make calls about the evidence—no  anthropologist can be completely literal-minded. But on what grounds should one  be making those calls? The logic underwriting what the author calls the “typologi- cal” method of reconstruction seems to require that there was once an original to- </page> <page sequence="5">  ReviewS | 493 tality, a religious logic that was shared across the archipelago: otherwise, why should  evidence from Borneo shed light on Maluku? But what is it that is being recon- structed when we put the different fragments being put back together again? Now  Domenig is certainly aware that none of these societies existed outside of time—he  does aim to reconstruct a developmental sequence both of house design and of  religious belief. This can lead to some interesting suggestions about how people  respond to their own material culture. For example, he speculates that the tavu of  Tanimbar, in southern Maluku, an elaborately carved structure that often resembles  a person with outstretched arms, was not originally anthropomorphic. Rather, he  proposes that poles that had once been used for holding ceremonial cloths (an idea  he obtains from distant Borneo) came to be seen as resembling arms. This resem- blance led Tanimbarese to take the structure for a human figure, so when new ones  were carved, faces were added (300–22). Whether this is correct may be subject  to debate—but even that possibility reveals that people are always responding to  the affordances their material surroundings offer them, and on that basis they are  elaborating spandrels, producing skeuomorphs, and otherwise engaged in continu- ous invention and reinvention. If people are now constructing new worlds from the  fragments of prior ones, why should we assume this was any different in the past?
