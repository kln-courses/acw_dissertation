<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Research Communications  Special Issue on Memoirs and Memory    Runne-Beana: Dog Herds Ethnographer1  Myrdene Anderson1*  1Department of Anthropology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.   *myanders@purdue.edu   Abstract Saami society in Lapland (now often called Saapmi), particularly the seasonally-nomadic reindeer-breeding  sector, is predicated upon mobility and autonomy of its actors. Runne-Beana, a talented reindeer-herding dog, exhibited  both mobility and autonomy when allocating to himself a peripatetic ethnographer, on the first day of five years of doctoral  dissertation fieldwork in arctic Norway in 1972. That family’s and the wider community’s reactions to Runne-Beana’s  behavior, and mine, highlight the tensions when mobility and autonomy compound with ideologies of ownership and  control. At the same time, his companionship profoundly shaped all field relationships, engendering an understanding of  dog culture as it is manifest in the herder/herding dog/reindeer triad and in the interpenetration of assumptions concerning  child/dog enculturation.
