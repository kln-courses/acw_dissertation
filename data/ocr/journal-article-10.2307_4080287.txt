Price, 15s.-The avowed purpose of this book "is to present a factual, gossipy account of the'Believe-It-or-Not' features of Australia's remarkable bird-life," and the author does this in readable fashion. Only occasionally are the facts interpreted with a tinge of anthropomorphism. The book is a pleasant introduction to some of the birds of Australia which has sometimes been described as a "zoological backwater." Bower-birds and lyre-birds are discussed in some detail, and the activities of cuckoos are treated in a chapter "Infants that commit 'murder'." The relations existing between birds, insects, snakes and man are considered; there is a chapter on "anting." Although the unusual has been stressed to such an extent in certain chapters (Very strange voices, Most curious nests, Strange happenings in birdland) that the overall picture of birdlife may be lost, the entire book is worthwhile reading. The photographs are excellent and illustrate a diversity of birds, nests, and eggs, as well as human beings.-H. I. FISHER.</page></plain_text>
