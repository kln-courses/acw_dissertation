<plain_text><page sequence="1">Social Evil / / BY TERESA BRENNAN 1 he real aim of the devil, wrote Goethe, is not the destruction of holiness but of life. Mephistopheles, a.k.a. Lucifer, laments that despite his best endeavors he will not succeed in destroying life's capacity to reproduce itself endlessly. In Goethe's story of Faust, Mephistopheles breaks away from the original source of creation in order to contest it. This original source is feminine. Goethe calls her Mother Night, and has the Devil name himself proud or haughty Light. When Lucifer breaks away from the Mother, he takes his light with him, but he must nonetheless stay "tied to bodies." He can only use his light through human agency. He is a parasite, dependent on and trapped in the very process of life he seeks to forestall (Goethe, part 1, scene 3, my translation). Goethe is not alone in his emphasis on life as the devil's real opponent. For Augustine too, the devil hates life because he has nothing of his own, no creative power. He tries to make up by capturing life, to pretend that he has what he can never have by controlling it. But life eludes him, with a ceaseless creativity that evades complete prediction, and hence control. That the devil desires control is axiomatic, for he feasts on power and the prospect of power. It is this that leads to his famous sin of pride, superbia. The devil's sin of pride has often been misunderstood as something rather magnificent. He will not "bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee (Milton, 1654, Book I). Genera- tions of those who have stood on the side of the oppressed have confused their cry with his. But as we shall see here, in a reading of Augustine's theology, the devil was prompted by something rather different from the desire to alleviate SOCIAL RESEARCH, Vol. 64, No. 2 (Summer 1997)</page><page sequence="2">SOCIAL EVIL 211 suffering. He was driven, very simply, by the desire to be boss. From this desire comes a fantasy from which all paranoia and its attendant miseries are born. In this fantasy, the state of being created by another, and depending on that other, is interpreted as the state of being controlled. The other or others want to keep you in your place. They created you so that they may feel superior. If not for their ignoble ambition, you could be, well, God. The keystone of this paper is the analysis of that fantasy. In describing it so far and in what follows, I draw not only on Augustine, but on Melanie Klein's and Freud's psychoanalysis. Both Augustine and psychoanalysis make omnipotence and control central in the analysis of evil and paranoia respectively. Their accounts are remarkably similar, and by joining them we fill in some of the lacunae in both, in terms of their motivational logic, and their narrative. On the basis of that improved narrative, I then turn briefly to how the same fantasy is played out in the modern social, attempting to draw a line between evil in a theological sense, and evil in the social. Psychoanalysis mediates between these poles. Of course Augustine, and a few others, who wrote of the Fall as the origin of evil, highlighting the devil's omnipotence in the process, did so long before the rise of the modern social whose beginnings Hannah Arendt dates to some three centuries ago. But it is this modern and profoundly western social which, as I will try to show, seeks to make omnipotent fantasies into realities, leading to an age of paranoia. This paper, then, is organized in three sections: the first on Augustine, the second on psychoanalysis, the third on the social. But before turning to these things, I want to note that the implications of this analysis of omnipotent fantasy for the social, and even the striking similarity between Augustine's and Melanie Klein's accounts, is obscured by any reading which valorizes Lucifer's pride. The striking example here is Hannah Arendt, who sees in Lucifer "that superbia of which only the best are capable: they don't want to serve God but to be like</page><page sequence="3">212 SOCIAL RESEARCH Him." 'They want, Arendt says, to be the equal of any other that there is. But Augustine himself makes it plain that superbia is much closer to omnipotence, the condition of denying others' rights or even the separate existence of others in favor of the wish to dominate and control them. This is what Augustine actually says of superbia. "(P)ride in its perversity apes God. It abhors equality with other men under Him; but, instead of His rule, it seeks to impose a rule of its own upon its equals (Augustine, 1948, Book XIX, 12, p. 318) Similarly, what makes the earthly city unheavenly is that "the princes and the nations it subdues are ruled by the love of ruling" (Book XIV, 28, p. 47). There is a lust for domination in them, a direct reflection of the devil's wish to assert omnipotence by dominating his equals. Stressing this is not to say that Augustine is an equalitarian, not at all. But is to say that he distinguished between service and domination, obligation and control. All human beings were equally obliged to serve God and love one another in service. The methods of service vary, but all are equal in their obligation, whether it is to serve or to obey, and all are equal before God (Books XVI and XIX). Even if one wishes not to pass so lightly over Augustine's feudalism, the fact remains that the wish to dominate is not the same as the wish for equality. The way in which the two wishes are the same for the devil will be plainer through drawing out how, in Augustine's account of the Fall, superbia is allied with Invidia or envy. For Augustine they cannot be separated, as he makes plain in his Confessions. Thus when he wonders how he might have sinned in infancy, he asks whether he might have done so by falling into a rage against my nurses and parents and many other discreet persons, and by endeavouring to strike and hurt them as much as I could, whensoever they did not punctually obey me? [non ad nutum vohtntatis obtemperantibus feriendo nocete niti quantum potest . . . ] Though he ought not to be said to be obeyed, who is but obeyed to his destruction. If so, it is the</page><page sequence="4">SOCIAL EVIL 213 weakness of an infant's body which is innocent, whereas the mind is not innocent. Myself have seen and observed some little child, who could not speak, yet he all in an envious kind of wrath, looking pale, with a bitter countenance upon his foster-brother. And who is ignorant of this? (Augustine, 1923, pp. 38-39). The rage at not being punctually obeyed is what would now be termed omnipotent rage. It sits alongside envy in infancy. As in infancy, so in the Fall. Invidia and Pride in concert cause Lucifer to act as he does. Invidia is the deadliest of the seven deadly sins because it attempts to destroy the source of life and goodness itself. It is the sin that bites the hand that feeds it, and by this biting, it robs even its doers of what they need in order to survive. Here again, invidia and superbia are intertwined. For closely related to, in fact another aspect of, the envy that bites the hand is pride, as an omnipotent denial of dependence. "It is to this basic denial of dependence, and so of gratitude, that Augustine will point, in politics, in thought, in religion" (Brown, 1967, p. 327). We can add that the denial is effected in politics by those who dispute God's claims by ruling through domination. It is effected in thought by those who lack curiosity and do not reflect on the conditions of their ability to think; in religion, in any heresy that downplays God's role in relation to creation, a recurrent theme in Augustine's dissection of paganism. In the last analysis, it is a denial of dependence, I think, on life and the capacity to generate life. Envy and Diabolus are synonyms often for death, reminding us that for Augustine the real struggle is between life and death, and that it is death that Jesus is meant to conquer. That life itself is at issue also emerges through a little reflection on Augustine's understand- ing of the good and the envious. The evil regard the good with "diabolical, envious hatred . . . for no other reason than they are good while themselves are evil" (Augustine, 1948, Book XV, 5, p. 55). Goodness, like life, can be shared without diminishing the stock of goodness of those who already have it,</page><page sequence="5">214 SOCIAL RESEARCH but there is something in evil that operates according to a zero-sum principal. If I have it, you may not. Mia vita, tu morte. My life, your death. The essence of envy seems to be exactly that what the one has the other loses, although it is an assumption that rests on the realization that goodness by being shared simply generates more of itself (ibid). This is the same principle that governs the proliferation of life. Lucifer then, by this interpretation, is envious of God's capacity to create life, which he interprets in terms of power: the power to make, the power not to do so. Having interpreted God's motivation as power (an interpre- tation that dogs all subsequent theology of evil), Lucifer wants this power for himself. Superbia in other words is the desire for power over the other, and it cannot be divorced from a comparative view of that other, in which what the other has, and the self does not, is envied. Envious and proud, Lucifer falls, and with his fellow fallen angels, attempts to build Hell as a rival to Heaven. His ambition is to ape the heavenly city, founded on earth through Abel, by the construction of the earthly city, whose founder is the rival- rous Cain. Envy is not only about possession. It is about rivalry. The other is seen as possessing something that gives them an edge. It is the edge, not the possession, that is resented. Rivalry is the wish to reverse positions. Lucifer does not only wish to be equal with God, he wishes to be God. Were Lucifer to be successful in his ambition, then from Lucifer's standpoint, God would be left with the options of filling Lucifer's recently vacated place, or disappearing altogether (not that we should imagine God has been much exercised over the question). In sum, power over the other, rather than the striving to be equal, is the hallmark of superbia for Augustine. This is why the devil's sin of pride is misunderstood when it is seen as something that "brings out the best" as Arendt put it.2 Superbia is rather omnipotence, the "lust to dominate" by taking the other's right. But there is a problem, not explicitly resolved by St.</page><page sequence="6">SOCIAL EVIL 215 Augustine, although his philosophy lends itself to a resolution. The problem is this: Why does Lucifer interpret the capacity to create as power over others? There is an answer to this question in the psychoanalytic theory of Melanie Klein, a theory also marked by its concern with envy, rivalry, and the denial of dependence. * * * In part, Klein gives us a more explicit answer because the very business of analysis is always a question of the interpretation of fantasies, of their projection and the distortions they effect. Reading Augustine through Klein, we might say that the devil interprets God's creativity as power and control because he projects his own motivations onto God. He fears that God will do to him what he wishes to do to God. Once we venture into the territory of fears and motivations, we find not only that Klein describes them in terms that parallel Augustine's, but that she also helps us account for the confusion between domination and creativity in other ways. The object of her analysis, of course, is not the devil and the Fall, but the infant and its fantasies. And the aim of the infant is not the creativity of God the father but of the mother. It is the dependence on the mother and the mother's creativity that the infant denies. It denies both because of its envy of that creativity and its rage at that dependence. At the outset then we can note that there is also a denial at work in Augustine's account: the creative source of life is figured as paternal.3 A paternal source of creation is already suspect; it may have already committed acts of expropriation and domination. The denial of creativity and dependence begins here with the denial of the mother, and all patriarchal- using the word for once in its strict sense- systems of thought invite a further denial, even diabolic denial, by a logic they themselves inaugurate. On the other hand, if we read Klein through Augustine, her theory takes on a</page><page sequence="7">216 SOCIAL RESEARCH coherence it otherwise lacks. Especially when buttressed by a little Freud, it becomes a coherent account of an omnipotent fantasy. It is as an account of the fantasy's inauguration and to some degree its overcoming. A caveat before proceeding. I have argued at length elsewhere4 that psychoanalytic insights and theories might be less pertinent to individual processes than they are to social processes. The impulses (and fantasies in the end are only impulses) described in psychoanalysis might not originate in the individual psyche, but in the broader social order. What I mean by this is not simply the truism that the psyche is socialized. I mean that psychoanalysts have observed social dynamics in miniature, that psychoanalytic thinking is pre- mised on looking down a telescope the wrong way. If omnipotent impulses are "out there" in the social, they wash through the psyche, especially the infant psyche, which is unshielded from the impact of affects from without, unpro- tected against energies and feelings that the infant mistakenly takes to be its own. In other words, the affects and impulses preexist the infant. We are born into them. But people then (and this is our tragedy) take these impulses to be our own, filtering them through the "I" or ego developed in the first few months* of life. The affect is held in common, but the ego makes up its own story, one that explains why the affects are appropriate to it. Henceforth, the affects become its own. This idea entails that the omnipotent fantasy we are about to discuss can play itself out at various levels: at the social as well as the individual level, and various gradations in between. At the social level, the omnipotent desire to obliterate creativity and distinctness could be manifest in the process of rendering real others superfluous. At the individual level, the overall omnipotent aim of the social fantasy might be obscure to individuals but they nonetheless partake of it when they are its thoughtless vehicles. Like Augustine, Melanie Klein assumes that the infant's envy is innate (Klein, 1980a). Envy's focus, for her, is not a sibling</page><page sequence="8">SOCIAL EVIL 217 (as it was for Augustine, when he observed the wrath of envy in infancy); it is the creativity embodied in the mother's breast, "which the infant regards as an endless source of bounty," and the mother's capacity to make babies and give birth. It is this capacity that envy denies, as it denies dependence on the mother's capacity to nurture and breastfeed. These denials are the mainstay of Kleiniail envy. For Klein, the infant's envy leads it into a series of attacks, in fantasy, on the mother's breast. It desires to devour, poison, and dismember the breast. Its weapons in these attacks are pitiful, merely the capacities it has in infancy: the capacity to bite, to urinate, to defecate. This much of the infant's reality enters into the fantasy at issue, which leads to paranoia in that the infant imagines that what it seeks to do in fantasy will then be done to it. It if wants to devour the mother, it imagines that the mother will eat it up. If it wants to make a mess with its excrements, or use them to poison, it imagines that it will be poisoned in turn. The Kleinian infant has another desire, one that is not foreshadowed explicitly in terms of our parallel, but worth noting. Klein's infant also desires to "get inside" the mother's body in order to know it, and it is this desire that, together with the infant's destructiveness, prompts its urge to dismember. For Klein, the desires to poison, devour, dismember, and know through dismembering are prompted by two interrelated forces. Envy is one of these. The other is the death drive working within. As with Augustine, the real enemy for Klein is death. The death drive in turn becomes anxiety, and anxiety motivates splitting and projection. Is there a way out, or around, death and its drives? For Augustine, it was trust and humility. For Klein, it is depression (and humility). As we have seen, to deal with its dependence on a breast it simultaneously denigrates, the infant splits (Klein, 1980b). It imagines that there is a good breast, an ideal perfect breast (that it does not acknowledge but keeps to itself), and a wicked bad breast that is out to get it. In this split, we may discern the origin of all those paranoid and persecutory</page><page sequence="9">218 SOCIAL RESEARCH impulses that make one thing, person, or group all good, and the other all bad. In this split, we find the origins of that persecutory religious zeal that takes as fundamental the so-called righteous impulse to persecute the bad other, forgetting that this persecutory impulse is but the other side of its own paranoid omnipotence. Fundamentalism makes the most of the diabolization of Satan, a figure who in the Old Testament was not evil incarnate. Fundamentalist religions adopt the position of a persecutory super-ego, standing high above, like the officials in Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon, and policing by their gaze. Their stance is reflected in the anthropomorphic understanding of God, and the banality of debates on evil, which often founder on their attempts to make God into a policeman. The more severe the paranoia, the more one feels oneself watched by a high and punitive official and found wanting. The more one feels this, the greater the sense of persecution, and the impulse to split into good and bad. For Klein, the way out of this situation is for the infant to realize that the good breast and the bad breast are one and the same: the bad breast is a product of its own fantasy. The badness comes from within itself, which implies that one should make sure one's own house is in order before worrying about anyone else's. The devil within has to clean himself up, rather than projecting his ailments onto others he seeks to annihilate. This of course is much easier said than done. First, cleaning up the mess one has made can be overwhelming because dealing with the fact that the badness, the destructive annihilating aggression, is to some extent one's own can be deeply depressing. In the ideal case, this depression leads to creative reparation, to the wish to make up for the damage done in fantasy or fact . But the depression over one's own destructiveness can be such that the only way to cope is to renew one's attacks on the thing that makes you feel bad, and thereby gain a respite from guilt by once more blaming others (and what is more, punishing them for making you feel so bad).5</page><page sequence="10">SOCIAL EVIL 219 Second, how far human beings are capable of reparation depends on how anxious they are. The greater the anxiety, the less the capacity to think and act in creative ways. As Klein puts it, the extent of the splitting, and of the poisoning, devouring, dismembering fantasies that accompany splitting, are mediated by anxiety. Anxiety derives from the death drive working within, and in the last analysis, Klein proposes that the death drive, like envy, is innate. It is not social. It is a psychical fantasy, and clearly not a consequence of the infant's actual social environment or social events. Unless, of course, the social acts out the fantasy at issue, thereby increasing anxiety in other ways. But to recapitulate thus far: we have a theory that tallies with the account of the Fall in terms of envy, paranoia, and the wish to destroy what one depends on. But there is also, in the theology of the devil, the denial of indebtedness, together with the desire to build Hell as a rival to Heaven. There is also the desire to reverse positions. Do these have a psychoanalytic parallel? Here Klein's analysis provides another lead. Though superficially [envy] may manifest itself as a coveting of the prestige, wealth and power which others have attained, its actual aim is creativeness. The capacity to give and preserve life is felt as the greatest gift, and therefore creativeness becomes the deepest cause for envy.6 This means all creativeness, not only that of the breast, although, as the quotation makes plain, envy conceals its real aim from itself. Superficially, it focuses on attributes or possessions, rather than the creative force that may (or may not) result in them. Envy will attempt to rival what it envies, and it will do so by constructing an alternative (hell for heaven), which appropriates while distorting features of the original. The features it appropriates, as superficial features, are visual ones. Or, to say a similar thing differently, the dialectics of envy conduct themselves at the level of images. The word envy is derived from the Latin verb videre: to see. By</page><page sequence="11">220 SOCIAL RESEARCH appearances envy attempts to categorize, which is why it lends itself so well to racism, as we shall see. More generally, Klein's analysis of envy shows that envious motivations are readily recognizable in slander and subtle calumny, such as the plausible lie told with apparent emotional sincerity by the purported friend. This is the lago paradigm. Alternatively, there is that other subtle brand of calumny that begins with praise, but which, having lulled its listener into the belief in the calumniator's kindness, then detracts. Envious motivations are also present in the denial of the labor involved in creativity. We recognize envy where creativity is seen as accidental, or where it is attributed to a lucky circumstance or an unearned possession. That creativeness is not viewed as intelligent or directed activity is consistent with envy's predilection to focus on creativity as the possession of certain attributes, rather than as a force in itself. Creativeness is seen less as what one does, than what one has. Turning now to the reversal of positions. This is best understood not in Kleinian terms, but through what Freud termed "the reversal into the opposite." The infant, or small child, imagines the reversal of the actual state of affairs, and imagines that the mother is a dependent infant (Freud, 1964, vol. 21, p. 236). In reversing the passive experiences of childhood into active ones in his play with a cotton-reel, Freud's grandson not only masters the mother's absence and introduces himself to deathly repetition (vol. 18, pp. 14-17 ); nor does he only, if simultaneously, enter the world of language through the mother's absence that forces him to call. He also makes the mother into a fantasized small child that he controls, a child that is also an inanimate thing. For Augustine, language is a fallen state because it takes away from direct or unmediated knowledge. The fall of Adam and Eve is a fall into symbolic language or "indirect knowledge through signs" (Brown, 1967, p. 261). In Freud's account, the advent of language accompanies an omnipotent pulling of the strings. The mother is will-less.</page><page sequence="12">SOCIAL EVIL 221 It would be consistent with a fantasmatic reversal of the original state of affairs if the infant were to correlate its actual dependent reality with the fantasy of control through imagining that the mother's activity takes place at its behest. It is not that it cannot act; it is just that it chooses not to do so. The infant does not wait upon the mother; the mother waits upon it. Ideally, as she has made one wait and suffer, she should be made to wait and suffer in turn. As if by omnipotent decree. For Freud, omnipotence is scattered all over infancy, but it is specially evident in primary narcissism, where the infant directs all its libido, its sexual and life energy, onto its own body (vol. 14, pp. 73-102). But omnipotence, I suggest, is also evident before primary narcissism comes into being: it is evident in the magical act of hallucination. This act, which Freud saw as the first act, is one he termed the proton pseudo or "first lie" in the psyche (vol. 1, pp. 352-59) (I add parenthetically that one of the names for the devil is the Prince of Liars). While a fantasy of controlling the breast cannot survive at the level of feeling (pain or pleasure), it can survive at the literally imaginary level of hallucination. In fact, the control- ling fantasy can be perpetuated through hallucinations, and this ability to perpetuate it must contribute to the pleasure in hallucination. In other words, by this account, the fantasy of controlling the breast and the act of hallucination are one and the same, which means that the amazing visual power of hallucination is tied to a desire for omnipotence from the outset. Moreover, the tie between hallucination and envy means that the very act of hallucination can never be neutral. In Augustine's imagery, if the fallen angel of light (Lucifer: lux = light, ferre = bring) fell because of envy there is no reason for supposing that he lost his power of light altogether (indeed Goethe tells us otherwise); rather, in the act of hallucination, light becomes actively distorted and redirected as an imaginary and necessarily envious vision.</page><page sequence="13">222 SOCIAL RESEARCH Overall, the omnipotence in the first hallucination lies in two things. The first as noted is the idea that one can call something into being simply by wishing it were there.7 The second omnipotent aspect of hallucination is its denial of space and time. If you want something like the breast, you imagine that the breast is before you here and now. You are instantly gratified. And then, when your hallucination disappoints you, and you do not get the breast in fact, your response is rage. Hence rage when one is not "punctually obeyed" in infancy. The absence of the longed-for breast brings home to you the fact that you are not omnipotent. There is something separate from you and beyond you, something you do not control. The response to this in turn is to annihilate the other and so do away with the unpleasant reminder that you do not control the universe. But right now, time is before us in a different guise. For Freud, psychical life in the beginning is governed by instant gratification, in that it is governed by the pleasure principle, or the Unlust (unpleasure) principle as it was first known. For Freud psychical growth consists in part in replacing the demand for instant gratification with the willingness to accept delayed gratification. People do not give up the desire for the breast, anymore than they give up the desire for the mother attached to it. What they do, in the case of men, is to replace that desire with the knowledge that one day they may have a woman like their mother. In the case of women, they become the mother. But of course, it would all be much less work, far less labor, if only one could just have it all now. The resistance to delayed gratification is then the denial of labor as much as of waiting time. The preference for delayed gratification must also owe something to a lack of faith or trust, to an inability to believe that the slower path ordained by time will lead to the desired goal. Or it may even be the suspicion that the goal that will be realized through following a path one does not control will differ from the goal desired here and now. To refuse trust is always to be a little paranoid, sometimes reasonably,</page><page sequence="14">SOCIAL EVIL 223 sometimes not. But either way, to refuse it is to seek to control one's own destiny. Necessarily this means controlling others. In fantasy, it means controlling one's mother, and ultimately, God. This control is always sought in the name of equality. But as should now be clear, equality with God can only be had by reversing positions, which results not in equality, but in control of the other onto whom one projected the desire to control oneself. Like instant gratification, this fantasy and the projections that go with it deny time. I can now spell out why the omnipotent impulse is primary, the keystone holding together the other negative traits of the psyche. Because one, in the first instance, wants to be without peer, because one envies a creativity one does not possess, one seeks either to control the other, or to do away with it by obliterating it. In infancy, in the attempt to annihilate the mother because she threatens omnipotence, in fantasy one devours her with one's mighty teeth or lays her waste with powerful excrement. Subsequently, the weapons become more serious. But having attributed one's own impulses to control and obliterate to the other, one then fears that what one wishes to do will be done to oneself. This is the origin of paranoia. In paranoia, acknowledged in psychoanalysis as a close relative of omnipotence, the cardinal psychical issues focus on questions of control, or the lack of it. Losing control is felt as a self-annihilation. The paranoid's projected fear is that just as he sought to control the other, so the other will seek to control him. This was the devil's projected fear. The foregoing synthesis of psychoanalysis and theology enables us to draw a line between theological and social as well as psychological evil, as should be plain in the next section. But first let us consider some of the theological implications. The primary denial, a denial it is now evident is anchored in envy, is the denial of the mother's creativity. The corollary of this conclusion is that any system that accords sole creative agency to the father, or symbolizes creativity solely in the father's name, partakes of that denial. A patriarchal religion might be</page><page sequence="15">224 SOCIAL RESEARCH reckoned a wise cultural compromise in that it also "contains" denial, by its very acknowledgment of the creative power of God, but the price of denying the mother is that the denial of dependence is inbuilt even when a religion seeks to combat this denial in other ways. To say this is not to advocate that the father be denied as the mother has been. The point rather is to give the mother the place that the doctrine of the Trinity allows for, but which an exclusivist and patriarchal culture has preempted. This third member of the Trinity is also, in the Catholic Liturgy, the "Giver of Life." Life, once more, is the creative force opposed to death and envy alike. It is a force, whether in its immanence in nature or in the capacity to give birth, that is maternal. If this argument, with its interweaving of psychoanalysis and theology, has contributed at all to theology, it has done so by placing the mother in the position she has been denied for two thousand years in the West. In the Hebraic tradition, the Spirit, termed Ruah, was feminine.8 * # * Thus far, we have a parallel between the theology of the devil and the omnipotent fantasy of infancy. Both are concerned with the wish to obliterate the other (either by controlling it, turning it into an object, or annihilating it) and both are motivated by rivalry. This rivalry is envious and it is paranoid. By virtue of interweaving theology with psychoanalysis, it is clear that all these negative traits: envy, paranoia, judgement- alism, destructive annihilating aggression, fear (of punish- ment, and punishment itself) spring from the same source: the belief in one's omnipotence, superbia as Augustine understood it.9 The concern now is with drawing a line between this fantasy as a theological account of the origin of evil, and evil in the social. I begin by noting that omnipotent fantasy is of course</page><page sequence="16">SOCIAL EVIL 225 evident in all the individual behavior, and for that matter, in individualism, which makes control of the other (person, thing, or surroundings) to one's own advantage the aim of existence. Omnipotence, in the sense given it here, is also dramatically evident in the activities of totalitarian regimes, where the business of controlling, dehumanizing, or mechaniz- ing people, or simply annihilating them is the order of the day, an order that is accompanied by all the requisite paranoia and projection. In fact having reviewed the concept of superbia, the problem Arendt confronted in the banality of evil is less of a problem. Arendt believed that the evil of totalitarianism is both radical and banal. I agree with Richard Bernstein (1996) that these are the same thing for Arendt: the new evil is radical because it falls outside anything explicable by the theological canon, and banal because it lacks a tragic dimension or depth, a satanic greatness. But contrary to this belief, I contend that the evil of Nazism is the apotheosis of evil understood in theological, Augustinian terms. "Making human beings qua human superfluous," eliminating "plurality, spontaneity, natal- ity and individuality," in Arendt's terms, is entirely consistent with a hatred of creativity, and a lust for its domination and control. This radical banality of evil in fact is one expression of an omnipotent fantasy; a banal social is another. Indeed, from the standpoint of omnipotent fantasy, it is possible to account for the similarities between the banality of evil and the social in Arendt's account of it. Both are shallow, thoughtless, and lacking courage as they go about the business of annihilation, evil by outright murder, the social by killing softly through the business of othering. It is on this, on the softer omnipotence of the social, that I will concentrate here. The rise of the social in Arendt's sense is historically located in the last three centuries. Famously, Arendt attributes its rise to the dominance of the life process, the business of animal survival, over the realization of human potential. But there is another explanation. The past three centuries, I want to propose, witnessed the acting out of an omnipotent fantasy that obviously predates the period in question, but which</page><page sequence="17">226 SOCIAL RESEARCH hitherto lacked the means for making itself come true. If we enquire into what those means are, the response is that they lie in an industrial technology deployed at the behest of capital in the conquest of nature, a technology that makes the desire to predict, and hence control, more realizable. From this perspective, more and more, the "life process" is conducted under the auspices of a fantasy that gradually make living into a series of demands for instant gratification, and competitive evaluations, as well as a means of staying alive. Eating today is not only a matter of eating, but of whether you can do so while being served without delay. Clothing and shelter were always means of marking prestige, but now they are also signs of how it is sought. They are ends in themselves, not only for the sake of the life process, but for the demonstration of how far one has succeeded in the aims of having it all come to you, of beating the competition, of securing one's personal fortress against the real or imaginary hostility of the vanquished. To put this issue in new terms, the life process has ceased to be primarily a matter of the body's survival, and become a matter of the mind's realization of its infantile impulses. Instant gratification is no longer a matter of hallucination. It is just around the corner, we will have it in a moment. We can visualize it on the silver screen, in a culture where visuality and virtuality- hallucinatory activity made social - have preemi- nence. We are told that bank cards mean that we no longer need to stand in a queue, or that our take-out will be delivered to us without delay, or that this airline will get us there before we have time to blink, or that such-and-such mobile phone will sit beside us, so that we no longer have to sit beside it. Instant gratification is also evident in the way we assign status. If you are important, the other party comes to you, if you are not, you go to them. These markers are measures of the extent to which a supposedly individual paranoid fantasy is acted out in the social order at large. Just as you might omnipotently wish that the other will serve you, or that you will be magically</page><page sequence="18">SOCIAL EVIL 227 provided with whatever you want instantly, so do the new service commodities promise to wait upon you at the same time as they make sure you do not have to wait. Similarly, as I have suggested elsewhere, new markers of class can be identified in terms of a person's relation to time and space. If the traversing of space is paid for by capital, out of surplus value, if your time is paid for at exorbitant rates, you are that much closer not only to the top, but to the realization of the omnipotent fantasy in everyday life (Brennan, 1993, Ch. 4). Of course, the others you have managed to struggle over to the top are already plotting how to get you: "they want to take our place" is how Franz Fanon summed up the colonizer's fantasy about the colonized. The omnipotent fantasy was of course present before the rise of the modern social, but it was not satisfied, or the promise that it could, would, and should be satisfied was not democratically available, nor was the prospect of this satisfac- tion constantly reinforced as the end and aim of existence. Without taking account of this, it is difficult to explain how the social takes over and inflates the dominance of the life process to the extent that it does. And the consequence of the economic organization that oversees the implementation of these new needs is that the conditions of the life process, "the ever-lasting nature-imposed condition of human existence" as Marx put it, is increasingly spoilt. Just as Klein saw the infant attempting to poison the mother with its excrements in fantasy, so in fact are industrial waste products spoiling the conditions of living. The alliance between the life process and nature evident in the "rhythms of labor" and the "metabolism" shared with natural processes is sundered. Indeed, it is plain that the limits in the ability to control nature were also limits on the extent to which a fantasy comes true, a fantasy of instant gratification and control, not to mention obliteration of the other. The very visuality of the fantasy, as I noted earlier, also lends itself to racism based on skin color as a favorite form of obliteration; and one can add here that perhaps in no other</page><page sequence="19">228 SOCIAL RESEARCH contemporary literature is there such awareness of evil as there is in writing on race, beginning with W. E. B. Dubois. This sketch of an omnipotent fantasy's dominance in material reality in the West is cavalier, and I have not attempted here to develop it at all in relation to the different sources on which I could draw to support an historical account: that is to say, to support the idea that the last three centuries do act out the omnipotent fantasy that psychoanalysis discerns, and which was prefigured in the Augustinian account of the Fall. But I can justify the cavalier nature of this social account not only in terms of the limited space at my disposal, or the time-honored excuse that I have argued it through in another book (Brennan, 1993, part 2). I can support it in that themes of control and domination of the natural world, and of the subject-centeredness that makes the world into standing reserve, there to serve the will of the subject, are familiar through the work of the early Frankfurt school, and the work of Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida. Or, to take another aspect of the omnipotent fantasy, the significance of the denial of indebtedness, this too is evident insofar as it is the refusal of indebtedness to the past that marks the rise of individualism and the bourgeois revolutions. It is, however, a denial of indebtedness to the authority of fathers, as for instance in John Locke's argument against Sir Robert Filmer. But most significantly the rise of individualism is both a condition of and a response to the rise of the free market, in which the place of women- as mothers- changes. No longer is it possible for a woman to mother and work productively, for work ceases to be household based. The free market is the means governing the deployment of technology and the consumption of people and nature. Its mechanisms are inexorable, in that they lead to a territorial and imperialist expansion in order to maintain a profit cycle based on continuous expropriation. "Taking the other's place" is guaranteed by them. Profit mechanisms distinguish capitalist expansion from the territorial imperatives that have marked</page><page sequence="20">SOCIAL EVIL 229 other empires, including the one dominant at the time Augustine was writing. By proposing that these capitalist events and processes enact a superbia that is in essence a fantasy of domination and expropriation, and as such a fantasy that long predates capitalism, I am proposing something that makes nostalgic arguments for a patriarchal order beside the point.10 For the processes discerned here begin with an omnipotent denial of the mother, a denial that paves the way for the denial of fathers, and that is not to be countered by reinstituting a patriarchal bond cemented by the maternal denial. For it is with that first maternal denial that omnipotence stakes its claims on creative territory that is not its own, and begins the business of competing for the honors of controlling and hence predicting the universe. It is worth drawing attention here to Alasdair Maclntyre's analysis of the role of prediction in the sciences born of the last three centuries. He contrasts the emphasis on prediction in the new-born human sciences with the way in which questions of unpredictability figure in medieval theology. For Aquinas, "If God knows everything that will occur, he confronts no as yet unmade decision. He has a single will (Summa Contra Gentiles, cap. LXXIX, Quod Deus Vult Etiam Ea Quae Nondum Sunt)." Maclntyre adds, "It is precisely insofar as we differ from God that unpredictability invades our lives. This way of putting the point has one particular merit: it suggests precisely what project those who seek to eliminate unpredictability from the social world or to deny it may in fact be in engaging in" (Maclntyre, 1984, p. 97). Maclntyre says no more on this front, but the project he has in mind is plainly an omnipotent one, in which complete predictability is no longer the province of God alone. Nor is control the only aspect of omnipotence that marks the new era; it extends all the way to paranoia and annihilation. All this is social evil, and evil in theological terms once the object of the fantasy becomes nature and the human other,</page><page sequence="21">230 SOCIAL RESEARCH rather than God understood in anthropomorphic terms. And what is most subtly evil is the way in which opposition to the acting out of the fantasy -the opposition to the othering of race or sex, or nation, class, and nature- is imbued with the same omnipotent impulses, insofar as the individuals who make up the opposition experience those impulses at more personal levels. For the same reason, genuine individuality becomes close to impossible. That is to say, it is impossible to the extent that the social and individual alike are governed by the same fantasy. At the personal level, to feel the fantasy and to be governed by it, as well as to enact it, is to be at odds and in competition with everyone else. Each person feels as his or her own that possessive competition, in which the values of evil becomes the values of all. The difference lies in the realms in which the values take hold. One may be assiduous in opposing racism and sexism, but be intensely competitive with others who write on the same themes, wishing to annihilate them or make them disappear, if only from a footnote. It is as though the very struggle to change the world is compensated for by petty paranoias and outbursts of narcis- sism at the individual level. Consider the relentless conformism that arises within radical groups. No matter how different them- selves, deviation within them is regarded as eccentricity. It is precisely here that we can discern evidence of the omnipresence of the omnipotent fantasy. It is especially evident in the rivalry, the struggles for prestige, the paranoid states and lack of soli- darity, the careful calculation of advantages, that plague those who are nonetheless opposed to, who attempt to repair, the var- ious manifestations of the fantasy in the exploitation of people and the planet. In other words, the identical, albeit concretized, impulses that are opposed on the large scale are present in min- iature in the psyches of the opposition, and they are strongest when they have been gratified, or to say almost the same thing, when there is no restriction on them.11 I find this more relevant to evil in the everyday than I do the accounts of psychopaths, although these too have their share of impulses. The point is that</page><page sequence="22">SOCIAL EVIL 231 they are not entirely foreign from us who claim more normality. We are all of us on a continuum, in which omnipotent impulses are acted out on different degrees of scale, taking more or less space. What we have gained by this survey is a sense of how an analysis of omnipotence enables us to draw connections between evil in a theological sense, and the ills of the psyche, as well as the radical analysis of what needs to be avoided, and rectified, in the social order. One might have an intuitive sense that self-aggrandizement is bad, and a more powerful conviction that racism is evil, but it is useful to be able to point to why. It may also be useful to have a moral yardstick for measuring psychical states and claims within as well as beyond those who seek to change the world. Notes 1 Hannah Arendt, 1978, p. 3. It is exactly this superbia that is lacking in what Arendt termed "the banality of evil." The evil of totalitarianism is banal because it lacks depth. As well as lacking pride, it lacks the other all-too-human motivations for evil: envy, or the "powerful hatred wickedness feels for sheer goodness," or covetousness, or even weakness. The banality of evil, exemplified in Eichmann, is manifestly shallow, is entirely consistent with thought- lessness, and the bureaucratic manner in which totalitarianism makes human life in its oluralitv superfluous. " The idea that "only the best are capable" of superbia is understandable enough in the light of the logic of The Human Condition. Arendt tells us that "aristocrat" derives from the verb aristeuein, roughly: constantly proving oneself "to be the best" (Arendt, 1958, p. 19). In turn, the wish to be the best, is, as is well known, what is lost for Arendt with the loss of the public striving, the vita activa, that goes into decline with the rise of the social. ** Although Augustine uses paternal language minimally, and there was some sense in which he and his colleagues disregarded traditional gender distinctions: one friend writes to him that he longs to draw milk from Augustine's breasts (St. Augustine, 1953, p. 238).</page><page sequence="23">232 SOCIAL RESEARCH 4 In History after Lacan (Brennan, 1993), and in the forthcoming book from which this paper is culled, The Age of Paranoia, 5 The logic of guilt and persecution goes like this: you attack someone or something or some people; guilt, which is the knowledge that you are responsible, starts to rise up; but this rising up of guilt is so unpleasant that one represses it, while remaining dimly aware that the other makes you feel really uncomfortable. And because they make you feel uncomfortable, you attack them again, and so the cycle starts over. 6 Klein, 1980a, pp. 176-235, pp. 201-2. Klein goes on to say, antic- ipating my argument herself: "The spoiling of creativity implied in envy is illustrated in Milton's Paradise Lost, where Satan, envious of God, decides to become the usurper of Heaven. Fallen, he and his other fallen angels build Hell as a rival to Heaven, and he becomes the destructive force which attempts to destroy what God creates. This theological idea seems to come down from St. Augustine, who describes Life as a creative force opposed to Envy, a destructive force." 7 This impulse survives in what the psychoanalytic argot terms "omnipotent" or "magical" thinking, in which if you think something is so, it is so. 8 The Gnostic gospel of Phillip shows that it was commonplace to see the third element of the divine being as female. The esoteric Phillip is ridiculing those who take the Virgin Birth literally. "Some said, 'Mary conceived by the holy spirit/ They are in error. They do not know what they are saying; for when did a female ever conceive bv a female?" (auoted in Pagels, 1995, d. 175). For this reason, the omnipotent fantasy constitutes a founda- tional event in the psyche. The omnipotent fantasy could also be called the foundational fantasy: this is the term I used for it in Histon after Lacan (1993). However, this term lays insufficient stress on the fact that omnipotence is the critical component in the fantasy's narrative structure. 10 Jürgen Habermas and Lacan, for instance, both yearn for the patriarchal world we have lost. 11 Not only did the nature-imposed limits restrict the extent to which an omnipotent fantasy could make itself material in the world on the large scale. The very restrictions on the impulses involved, the delay in gratifying them, enabled other more varied psychical developments to take place at an individual level. But if an omnipotent aim is not frustrated, if it seems to be gratified, it becomes more dominant in the psyche. It feeds on its own</page><page sequence="24">SOCIAL EVIL 233 realization, but because it can never be realized in full (one can never contain and therefore be the mother) the closer one comes to it, the hungrier one gets. If the illusion that the demands contingent on the fantasy are rightful is reinforced, the strength of the demands grows, if for no other reason than that the ability to resist or rechannel those demands is diminished. To illustrate: it is a commonplace paradox of academic life that the more recognition people get, the hungrier they are for it, and the more they get, the worse their work becomes.
