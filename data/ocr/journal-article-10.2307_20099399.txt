<plain_text><page sequence="1">L?SZL? GARAI AND MARGIT K?CSKI POSITIVIST AND HERMENEUTIC PRINCIPLES IN PSYCHOLOGY: ACTIVITY AND SOCIAL CATEGORISATION (On the question of continuity and discontinuity between Vygotsky and Leontiev) Since B. F. Lomov1 raised the idea in the USSR that Activity Theory was biased because it took into consideration only subject-object interaction, and that it had to be complemented by a theory of the subject-subject relation as well, variants of this idea have appeared again and again. Thus, at the round-table conference organized by the editors of Voprosy filosofii on the philosophical problems of activity, someone suggested that dialectical materialism dealt with subject-object interaction while historical materialism allegedly dealt with the subject subject relation; some people suggested that communication (obscenie) should be added to activity (dejateVnost) in order to represent the subject-subject relation while others asserted that this latter should be introduced in the analysis of activity itself as its aspect. At the same time, V. A. Lektorsky objected that the subject-subject relation cannot exist without being mediated by objects, let alone by the bodies, gestures, utterances of subjects in relation.2 G. Markus3 posed a problem which was not only similar by its logical structure to the one just mentioned but was at the same time its more general version. He described and analyzed two philosophical theories of human existence: a positivistic one that takes production as its paradigm and a hermeneutic one whose paradigm is language. The first theory treated production as a purely technical activity which can be characterized by a goal-rationality (Zweckrationalit?t) of advance from the state of a lower to a higher value. Therefore, the second theory seemed to complete the first one: language was seen as a culture type social categorization of those sharing different norms without being able to evaluate these norms by any measure independent of them. Now, when a Marxian philosophy of history describes social super Studies in Soviet Thought 42:123?135,1991. ?1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">124 L?SZL? GARAI AND MARGIT K?CSKI structure as based on production the latter is very often identified in a positivistic way. Therefore attempts are made to complement it by another one dealing with language-type relations in a hermeneutic way, i.e., considering them as not open to any criticism. This would make intelligible the kind of historico-social relations meant, e.g., by M. Sahlins4 who states that one may "concede that it may be in the nature of agricultural production that father and son cooperate, but it is not in the nature of agricultural production that father and son cooperate as opposed to mother and daughter, mother's brother and sister's son or Don Quixote and Sancho Panza" (p. 23). On the other hand, Markus demonstrates that this positivistic inter pretation of production, although shared by many Marxists as well as by Marx's critics, was not envisaged by Marx himself who distinguished this category from that of work. While work is the interaction between man and nature, Marx distinguished the self-creating praxis of man as another aspect of production. Considering this latter aspect Markus lets us understand that Marx's concept of production comprises both activity with its technical norms imposed by problem-solving (Popper5) on the actors and what we posit as social categorization with its cultural norms which are imposed on us in language-games (Wittgenstein6). VYGOTSKY'S DOUBLE-ORIENTED THEORY In the same way, when Lev Vygotsky established his Marxian psy chology7 his conception comprised both activity theory and social categorization theory: Analyzing the phylogenesis of human thought and speech Vygotsky8 found that they "have different genetic roots [. . .] In animals, speech and thought spring from different roots and develop along different lines [.. .] K?hler's experiments proved that the appearance in animals of an embryonic intellect, i.e., of thinking in the proper sense, is in no way related to speech. The 'inventions' of apes in making and using tools, or to finding detours for the solution of problems, though undoubtedly are rudimentary thinking, belong to a pre-linguistic phase of thought development [. . .] Anthropomorphic intellect without an thropomorphic speech in this respect, and the independence of intellec tual operations from the 'speech' of the apes, this is how one could</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY 125 summarize the conclusions to be drawn from K?hler's respective re searches" (pp. 76?77). At the same time, "as more recent investigations have proved one can find in the chimpanzee a relatively well-developed 'speech' which is in some respects not unlike human speech, most of all phonetically. K?hler writes of the 'speech' of apes he studied for many years at the Canary Island Anthropoid Station: 'Their phonetic expres sions denote only desires and subjective states; they are expressions of affects, never a sign of anything objective' " (pp. 78?79). The same expressivity characterizes the gestures of monkeys as well; similarly, no semiotic function is manifested by the 'drawings' of monkeys. Thus, phylogenetic antecedents of human thought are represented in Vygotsky's oeuvre by monkeys' 'thinking' to solve external problem situations in their activity. Before examining Vygotsky's other idea for phylogenetic antecedents of human speech, let us consider how this first idea was developed by Leontiev.9 LEONTIEV'S ACTIVITY THEORY Alexei Leontiev considers (see especially Vol. 1, pp. 184?279 op. cit.) sensation, perception, and animal intellect as antecedents of human thinking in the sense that all these psychic performances accord to ac tivity a goal-directed flexibility distinguishing it both from a rigid reflex and from a random performance. Sensation, perception, animal intellect, as well as human thinking give insight into conditions of activity: In the first stage of phylogenetic development invertebrates identify and localize, by means of sensation, biologically significant objects before starting to approach them or escape from them. In the following stage of phylogenetic development, perception endows lower vertebrates with the power to identify and localize objects as obstacles to reaching biologically significant objects and, thus, to direct activity to surmount these obstacles. In the next stage of phylogenetic development mammals identify and localize, by means of an animal intellect, objects as tools for surmount ing obstacles and, despite them, ensuring the biologically needed effect. It is to be noted that neither perception, nor animal intellect, when providing activity with an orientation basis (Galperin10), represent iso</page><page sequence="4">126 L?SZL? GARAI AND MARGIT K?CSKI lated objects but a structure of mutually referring objects: an obstacle is not an obstacle unless it is in reference to a biologically significant object, and no tools exist without being referred to that obstacle. Now, the same is true of the final stage of phylogenetic development, only the structure of objects man identifies and localizes by his thinking has become still more complicated. This faculty is put into action when, on the one hand, needs arise to use things as tools for surmounting obstacles and despite them ensuring the biologically needed effect; and, on the other hand, when there is interest in keeping these things in so far as they bear social values. On this last point our interpretation goes somewhat further than that of Leontiev. He evokes and analyzes the structure of hunting where beaters drive the game instead of overtaking it, but by this means they contribute to the game being brought down by the collective and, thus, indirectly, ensure for themselves a biologically needed effect. Com paring such an activity with one comprising a detour referred to the object as tool, Leontiev states that in the latter case "the first phase of the activity leads the animal with natural necessity to the chance of carrying out its second phase. [But] when a beater startling the game satisfies his need, it is by no means a result of the natural conditions of the given object [vescnoj] situation; rather on the contrary, in normal cases these natural conditions are such that by startling the game one cancels the possibility of getting hold of it. What then links up this activity's direct result with its final result? Obviously, it is nothing but the relation of the given individual to the other members of the group thanks to which he gets his share of the prey from their hands, i.e., the share of the product of common work activity. [. . .] It is the very activity of other people that presents an objective basis for the specific structure of a human individual's activity [. . .] Hence, the complex activity of higher animals subjected to natural object connections and relations is transformed in man into an activity subjected to connections and relations that are social from the very beginning" (Op. cit., p. 229). IS LEONTIEV'S SOCIAL ACTIVITY SOCIAL? It is known that a chimpanzee has the competence to learn how to get tokens from a machine provided that by means of these tokens it can</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY 127 get food from another machine (Wolfe11; Cowles12). On the other hand, the chimpanzee may learn how to get tokens from that machine even when the agent between tokens and food is not another machine but another chimpanzee: it learns to go with its token to a window in the wall of the experimental cage, pass the token through the window to the other chimpanzee who may reach with this token the food-supplying slot-machine in its cage, provided that the first chimpanzee gets its share from the hand of the second one. Now, on one hand, there is hardly any difference between the structure of the first, purely "technical," and that of the second, "social," performance. If it holds true of the case when the animal deals successively with two different machines that "the first phase of the activity leads the animal with natural necessity to the chance of carrying out its second phase," and that here "the complex activity of higher animals [is] subjected to natural object connections and relations," then it must be equally true of the case when a second animal happens to be substituted for the second machine. On the other hand, there is hardly any difference between the structure of the activity by which the animal manipulates another of its species the same way it would a food supplying slot-machine (i.e., it puts the token somewhere in order to get some food and then waits for the food), and the specifically human activity of Leontiev's beater. If it is true that "in normal cases these natural conditions are such that by startling the game one cancels the possibility of getting hold of it," it must be equally true that by giving away the token one cancels the possibility of getting hold of food. And if Leontiev finds it obvious that "it is nothing but the relation of the given individual to the other members of the group thanks to which he gets from their hands his share of the product of common work activity," why should we consider the same relation less obvious with regard to the case of animal cooperation? This amounts to saying that, if Leontiev has reason for maintaining that such kind of cooperative activity in man is "subject to connections and relations that are social from the very beginning," we shall have the same reason to make the same statement for the cooperative activity of animals. What we affirm instead is that, when a social factor does intervene in a specifically human activity it appears as opposed to purely technical aspect of activity, including opposition to its socio-technical aspect, i.e.,</page><page sequence="6">128 L?SZL? GARAI AND MARGIT K?CSKI cooperation prescribed by technical norms. To put it in terms of Sahlins' statement cited above: if, e.g., father and son cooperate when the nature of agricultural production (or of hunting) prescribes this cooperation, this is not yet a social factor intervening in specifically human activity. This latter is represented by the fact that, e.g., nobody but father and son cooperate; it would be still more convincing if a taboo prevented the same cooperation between "mother's brother and sister's son or Don Quixote and Sancho Panza," despite technical norms binding for anyone who is up to the technical function in question. Whenever a technical solution to a problem may be found without any social restriction, the intellect put in action is of the same nature as the one orienting "the complex activity of higher animals subjected to natural object connections and relations." Neither is the specifically human faculty of thought needed in a situation where social restrictions prevent people from even taking into consideration the solution that would be prescribed for their problem by technical rationality. Let us imagine, e.g., a situation where a king escapes to an uninhabited island superabundant in game with three lackeys one of whom happens to be a genuine crack shot, and with a single gun; technical rationality would suggest that they earn their livelihood by hunting with this lackey as hunter and, as they have no pack, that the other two and His Royal Majesty be beaters. Though is put into action when needs arise to arbitrate between, on the one hand, technical prescriptions that are binding for several conditions of using things as tools and, on the other, social restrictions on some of these conditions. TOWARDS ANOTHER MEDIATING FACTOR Do we claim by all this that, at least as far as specifically human activity is concerned, considerations about subject-object interaction ? which represent a purely technical aspect of that activity ? should be complemented by a theory reckoning with subject-subject relation as well? At the beginning of this paper we cited a view which claimed that this social aspect of relations was missing from the thinking of the Vygotsky school, and that therefore Activity Theory had to be com plemented by a communication theory.</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY 129 However, we have seen that Vygotsky himself reckoned with two factors from the very beginning of human phylogeny to the very end of human ontogeny: thought by means of which subject reflects object and speech by means of which subject expresses subject. Thus, Vygotsky's theory implies both of the required factors. In general, psychology discusses thought in terms of external-internal opposition: as something by which the subject builds up internal images of the external states of object. Now, for Vygotsky thought is immedi ately referred not to its object but to the activity, which is an entity that may not be represented, as Leontiev put it, in the terms of "the main distinction which the classical psychology of Descartes and Locke is based upon: between, on the one hand, the external world of res extensa, including external, physical activity, and, on the other, the internal world of res cogitans," and which, he continues, "should yield its place to another distinction: between, on the one hand, the object reality including its forms (verwandelte Formen) elevated to the ideal, and, on the other hand, the subject's activity including both external and internal processes" (Op. cit., Vol. 2, p. 152). Now, if we wish to construct and apply a logically more or less coherent conceptual system, we cannot postulate communication as a category corresponding to activity, as the rivals of Activity Theory mentioned in the introduction to this paper insist. In this regard, communication as Vygotsky understands it (let us recall that in his view speech in its most primitive form and even in its preliminary form in apes is communication) is indeed a category corresponding to thought: just as thought is the subjectal image of a non-subjectal world, language is in the same way a non-subjectal expression of the subjectal world. For the sake of the theoretical work, one would need to introduce at this point a turn regarding speech and its reference similar to the one taken by Activity Theory when it discovered that between thought and its reference there exists a mediating factor that cannot be described in terms of the external-internal opposition. Now we affirm that there is an analogous mediating factor between speech and its subject identified neither with external nor internal conditions, viz., social categorization.</page><page sequence="8">130 L?SZL? GARAI AND MARGIT K?CSKI COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL CATEGORIZATION When the rivals of Activity Theory advance the idea of a "subject subject relation" they do not mean the social relation elaborated by social categorization. As to the confusion of philosophic categories on which their considerations are based (when, e.g. Lomov1 substitutes the concept of "subject-object relation" for that of "man's relation to material world" (otnosenie celoveka k predmetnomu miru) and the concept of "man's relation to other people" for that of "subject-subject relation" (pp. 125?126), we have presented some critical remarks in another paper (Garai and K?cski13). The confusion is due to the fact that "other people" may just as well constitute an object for "this very person" (be he a hairdresser, riot policeman or teacher), as a subject together with him. In this latter case, persons are not opposed to one another as subject to some other subject, but constitute one supra-individual subject. In point of fact, it is only one of psychology's twin questions to understand what takes place between subject and object. However it is not worth complementing it by another question if the latter turns out to be the same question only put in another way ? the same question: investigating, what takes place between a person as subject and another person as object. The real complementary question to be asked is: how the social categorization distinguishes those individuals who constitute the subject of a well defined activity from those who do not. Now, if we look at the genetic antecedents of speech without any preconceptions, we come to realize that in phylogeny, a statement such as e.g., K?hler's about the 'speech' of apes never being a sign of anything objective and denoting only subjective states, means this: it denotes precisely the difference of being and of not being a well-defined subject. More exactly, what we are concerned with here is not the 'speech' of animals but their communication in general, even if it is not displayed in a speech-like activity but in a form reminiscent much more of human writing than speech. Ethological investigations have thrown light, e.g., on the kind of animal behavior by which an individual or a smaller or larger group attaches certain marks to certain parts of the external world, making it</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY 131 in this way its territory, i.e., a demarcated place which the individual(s) who placed the sign cannot leave beyond a well defined distance and/or a length of time, and which other individuals of the species may not approach within a well defined distance and/or a length of time. If the latter do so, they provoke a fighting activity in those defending their territory. The marks mediated by territory distribution provoke a social categorization effect: the individuals who defend their territory are disposed, while intruders are indisposed to fight; when the animals defending their territory rout the intruders, the latter flee toward their own territory, and the moment they cross its border the power relations immediately change. Staying on a territory with or without a mark placed by the animal itself may dispose or, respectively, indispose it to other (e.g., mating) activities as well.14 Similar territorial effects of social categorization by disposition and, respectively, indisposition can be observed when the mark is not attached to the territory of a population but to some or to all of its individual members: e.g., in certain species male individuals place during mating a biochemical substance as their mark on the female so as to indispose other males to mate with that female, even if impreg nation was not effective. Furthermore, in supra-individual organizations, functions similar to the above are performed by marks which an individual does not place outside but bears on itself as a result of a social event: e.g., in fighting, by posture or some other means, the winner and loser display the mark of triumph and defeat, respectively ? these marks may determine a rather lasting hierarchical organization of individuals. In all these performances communication marks an individual as subject (or several individuals as participants in a supra-individual subject) of a social function and, hence, disposes it (them) to carry out this function, while other individuals of the same population are marked as non-participants in that subject and, therefore, are indis posed to the performance of the same function. A social relation (of being, e.g., similar to, or different from, others, the first or last within a range, etc.) is by no means a property of the individual in question in the same way as is the colour of its eye or its temperament; but neither can these relations be attributed to this</page><page sequence="10">132 L?SZL? GARAI AND MARGIT K?CSKI individual's social environment: the social relation to be elaborated by social categorization is simply non-intelligible in terms of external internal opposition. TABOO AND TIMING Despite the discoveries of ethology, social relations are still often described as something that characterizes man in opposition to animals: above we saw, e.g., that the Activity Theory of Leontiev describes the structure of human activity as one with the specificity of being socially distributed in, as we put it, a taboo-like setting. A taboo might be described as an incompatibility of two social rela tions establishing people's social identities. If e.g., A and B are brother and sister (or father and daughter, or son and mother) there should not be established between them a relationship eventually involving sexuality. The latter relationship (with or without marriage or romantic love) may equally be precluded by that of the difference in social cate gories the individuals belong to: Romeo and Juliet are not supposed to be in love, and still less are they supposed to be married since they are in a relation of belonging to families hostile to each other. Instead of considering social categorization as being a human specificity we would argue for their having human specificity. The above performance when individuals in an animal population mark themselves by their communication as belonging to one or to another swarm or flock and then establish an incompatibility between belonging to different categories and occupying the same territory may only be considered as an elementary taboo-like mechanism in animals. Now, Leontiev's theory considers that the activity has its human specificity as far as social factors are included in its structure. In an analogous way we consider that the social categorization has its human specificity when its structure includes activity factors: Activity is a temporal process in which the meaning of different factors changes depending on their timing: even the simplest lack of any arousal has different meaning depending on whether no aim has yet been set for an activity or has already been reached. Social relations in animals may exist with no timing factor being involved: whenever a mark is placed on a territory, on other individ</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY 133 ual(s) of the population, or on the very individual(s) who placed the mark, it has the same force until it becomes destroyed by natural decomposition. For human social relations involving activity the same communication event has different social impact depending on its timing as referred to the past record of the interaction between interrelated parties. Let us take a simple act of establishing, maintaining, or changing relations such as greeting or not greeting somebody: obviously, its social effect will be different whether you greet him because whenever you meet him you do so, or this is the first time you pay homage to him; again, it is not the same whether you refrain from greeting someone you have never greeted, or you break off a long habit of greeting now. Social psychologists and psychiatrists have long been concerned with certain implications of this anthropological fact. For instance, the gain and-loss theory has found that liking or hating another person is more definitely determined if I am gaining or losing his esteem, than if he has a uniformly high or low opinion of me. According to the Palo Alto school (Sluzki and Ransom15), what accounts for the deterioration of relations, at least between two persons, is that they interpret the past re cord of their relation-shaping acts in different ways: e.g., the husband believes his wife quarrelled with him, and so he started drinking, while the wife thinks her husband had been drinking, and so she started quarrelling. When Lucien S?ve16 outlines a theory of socially deter mined personality he claims that mastering one's time balance is the definitive criterion of developed personality. IN SUMMARY Vygotsky established a theory of the basic feature of the human mind. According to him, thought and speech that developed along inde pendent lines up to the penultimate stage of phylogeny interact in man to such an extent that in ontogeny even the most primitive speech (that which Piaget considers egocentric speech) is related to thought and its object, just as the most advanced thinking is related to speech and its subject. If we wish to construct on this Vygotskian basis a developed psychological theory it must comprise a pair of twin theories:</page><page sequence="12">134 L?SZL? GARAI AND MARGIT K?CSKI an ACTIVITY THEORY that takes into consideration the taboo being imposed by social categorization on activity; and a SOCIAL CATEGORIZATION THEORY that reckons with the timing social categorization is endowed with by activity.
