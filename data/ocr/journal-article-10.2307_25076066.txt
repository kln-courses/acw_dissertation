New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. x, 356 pp. $74.00 (cloth); $27.50 (paper). In Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls, June McDaniel gives life to popular goddess worship in West Bengal, identifying three major strands of Shakta religion and throughout focusing on its lived religious experience. She organizes her data into typologies?a method she associates with the traditional approach of history of reli gions and writers such as Joachim Wach and Mircea Eliade. Accordingly, the three subtypes of Shaktism that she studies?Folk Shaktism, Tantric and Yogic Shaktism, and Shakta Bhakti?are revealed by McDaniel's careful attention to their respective myths, legends, folklore, deities, songs, rituals, sacred texts, and testimony of prac titioners. In her chapter on Folk Shaktism, McDaniel reveals that four themes emerge in the worship of folk and tribal deities: regionalism; pragmatism; divine personality as profoundly anthropomorphic; and variation of divine form, that is, shape-shifting. After illustrating these themes, McDaniel details the phenomena of possession, as ceticism, the goddess as she is understood to be in nature, and experiences of Folk Shaktas, all through interesting vignettes drawn from her fieldwork. One contem porary example is Shitala, formerly a goddess of smallpox, whose worship declined concomitantly with the disease. Today, Shitala has undergone a career and image change: she is now the AIDS goddess, and artist-singers compose new stories about her in different locales, with the commonality that she is worshipped to save people from AIDS, suiting the pragmatic goals of a newly devoted and fearful constituency. The longest chapter is devoted to Tantric and Yogic Shaktism. Here McDaniel considers how negatively Tantrikas are viewed by various Bengalis. The sensational ized image of the tantrika and rationalist pressures from communist ideology and Western science have led some to fear harassment or career problems should their identity as Tantrikas emerge. Thus, while McDaniel here stays true to her interest in popular goddess worship and privileges the living informant, the climate makes reach ing informants difficult: "Stalking the wild tantrika is a time-consuming affair, where each person involved is speculating upon the hidden roles and practices of the others" (p. 69). She follows this wry observation by problematizing her own role as a Western researcher, leading her to comment on how "responding to even a sympathetic West erner forces the informant into the role of a defender of his religion, elaborating myths and emphasizing his own status" (p. 69). She typologizes the diverse phenomena first into folk tantra, followed by the more abstract and textually based classical Tantra,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS?SOUTH ASIA 447 traditionally called Kali-kula. She next turns her attention to the practice of kundalini yoga, Tantric rituals, and several wonderfully detailed biographies narrating the ex periences of Shakta Tantrikas. McDaniel suggests that Folk Shakta tantra has its origins in the tribal traditions of Bengal's rural healers and shaman-magicians, whereas Classical Shakta Tantra in Bengal originates from the Sanskrit philosophical traditions of Advaita Vedanta and Samkhya (p. 143). They became "linked by the value on esoteric yogic knowledge and practice, which can adapt to each. Tribal shamanism plus esoteric yoga equals folk tantra; classical philosophy plus esoteric yoga equals classical tantra" (p. 144). The third chapter on Shakta Bhakti describes four major types: folk bhakti, emo tional bhakti, political Shakta bhakti or Shakta nationalism, and universalist bhakti or Shakta Vedanta. All four are thoroughly described and illustrated, but my favorite portion concerns the political Shakta bhakti, which I found to be an excellent intro duction to contemporary currents. I enjoyed reading how Shakta bhakti figured in united Hindu/Muslim opposition to colonialism. I was intrigued by her description of Muslim Kazi Nazrul Islam, a favorite Shakta poet among her informants. The fourth chapter provides both the traditional history and mythology, as well as modern trans formations, of the great Bhakti goddesses of west Bengal. While I found all of this book well researched and interesting, the final two chapters were particularly lively and engaging. McDaniel illustrates how Shakta re ligion and practices have been reinterpreted in the West, particularly by those es pousing New Age religions. "Shakta tantra has become a religion of hedonism, with an immanent goddess recognized as dwelling within the woman, and sexuality un derstood to be a spiritual path" (p. 266). Kundalini yoga has been similarly trans formed, such that its values are primarily bodily health, relaxation from stress, and the occasional religious insight. The less common Westernized goddess worship has tended to function as a psychological tool to address gender issues. McDaniel con cludes that goddess worship has for the Westerner gained the values of sexual freedom, bodily health, and psychological healing, but in so doing, Westernized Shaktism has lost the traditional emphases on devotion and asceticism. In her conclusion, McDaniel offers many provocative comments on postcolonialism, postmodernism, and modern research methods. I would recommend Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls for those seeking to learn more about popular Indian culture and Bengali religion as well as modern religion. Emi nently accessible, it could be adopted for undergraduate courses in history, religious studies, and anthropology. Cynthia Ann Humes Claremont McKenna College</page></plain_text>
