Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1993. xiv, 148 pp. A vexing conundrum that has periodically puzzled students of Jewish angelology involves the origin of the angels' proper names. While the older strata of biblical literature seem content with anonymity, Second Temple and postbiblical sources attest a veritable explosion of interest in the identification of individual subordinate supernal entities. Scholars (predictably) have put forward a variety of proposals in their attempts to explain this phenomenon. Some stress the persistent influence of prolonged contact with Babylonian and/or Iranian ideas regarding the corporate structure of heaven. Others view the emergence of angels to be a logical consequence of an alleged conceptual shift away from an anthropomorphic deity; divine activity in the cosmos and supernatural integrity could thus be simultaneously preserved. Still others argue for a process involving the gradual hypostatization and personification of particular divine attributes or qualities. The present volume by Saul Olyan is a significant contribution to the discussion about the origin of and impetus behind angelic nomenclature. Therein he has mounted a careful and sustained argument for the crucial role of biblical exegesis in the generation and application of proper names for certain individual angels and for certain angelic brigades or groups. The cogency of Olyan's thesis is bolstered by the demonstrably "text-centered" character of both Second Temple-era and postbiblical Jewish literature, whether "classical" or "sectarian" in provenance. As long as the biblical text is regarded as a well-nigh inexhaustible source of continuing revelation by various religious communities, it will invariably attract interpretive efforts bent upon extracting the divine mysteries thought to be encoded therein, including, as Olyan ingeniously demonstrates, new information about angels.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 385 The book begins with an informative introduction which surveys and assesses previous theories regarding "the articulation of the angelic host" (p. 11), and which also includes an initial presentation of the author's main argument. This is followed by four chapters of "case-studies" that support his thesis, each chapter conveniently arranged around a particular theme: "Patterns in Angelic Exegesis" (chap. 1), "The Exegetical Origins of the Angelic Brigades" (chap. 2), "Exegesis and the Names of Individual Angels" (chap. 3), and "Angelic Names Derived from Divine Attributes and Cultic Terms" (chap. 4). A final chapter ("Conclusion") summarizes the results of the investigation and restates the author's thesis of the primacy of biblical exegesis in creating a framework that supported the development of Jewish angelology. An appendix, bibliography, and indices of passages and authors complete the book. Olyan shows that the most fruitful biblical passages for the textual gener- ation of angelic groups or individual names are those featuring hierophanies, particularly ones exhibiting military terminology, a textual crux, or a rare word. Although most of his examples are convincing to this reader (a tour de force is Olyan's exemplary demonstration of the exegetical link between Psalm 78:49 and LXX Job 40:11 [pp. 98-100]!), there are a few instances where he resorts to special pleading or goes beyond the available evidence. For example, since 4QShirShab does not mention the Hayyot as an angelic brigade, but does cite the Cherubim, it "may suggest that the writer. . accepted [Ezekiel's] equation of Hayyot and Cherubin" (p. 33). Perhaps. Yet given the extremely fragmentary nature of the Qumran ShirShab remnants, this constitutes a dangerous argument from silence. Olyan's identification of the Ma 'asim (pp. 42-47; cf. Ezekiel 1:16) as "angels" in the ShirShab fragments, although derivative from Newsom, seems peculiarly forced. Could they not be viewed simply as personified cultic articles or appurtenances, d la the tendency demonstrated in his own chapter 4? A similar dissatifaction emerges from his suggested exegetical origin for the group termed Degelim from Song of Songs 5:10 ( pp. 55-58); here one suspects that the evidence is being unnecessarily forced into a Procrustean bed. Finally, the author's discussion of the intriguing entity named Azazel (pp. 109-111) would have profited from a fresh consideration of the related later forms like Asael, Azael, and Uzziel. As is, it presents no new insights, exegetical or otherwise.
