Petersen, Memphis State University K. Peter Takayama, Memphis State University This study tests Roof's (1972, 1976, 1978) local-cosmopolitan theory of religious com- mitment using a sample of Catholics living in west Tennessee. Consistent with Roof's theory, local community reference (localism) had significant positive effects on four measures of religious beliefs and played a limited role in mediating the effects of education, size of hometown, and length of residence on these measures. However, localism had inconsequential effects on four behavioral measures of religiosity. Possible explanations for these findings and implications they have for the generalizability of the theory are discussed. In recent years, a great deal of the research in sociology of religion has attemp- ted to identify antecedents of individual religiosity. While this research has suc- ceeded in uncovering a number of "correlates" of religiosity, relatively little effort has been directed toward developing a theoretical understanding of the sources of religious commitment. Roof's (1972, 1976, 1978) local-cosmopolitan theory is an important exception. His theory is perhaps more systematic and comprehensive than any existing theory of religious commitment. The purpose of this paper is to test the aspect of Roof's theory which implicates local com- munity reference as an intervening variable between several background variables and religiosity. To do so, many of the analytical procedures employed by Roof (1976, 1978) in his study of Episcopalians are applied to a sample of Catholics. Roof criticized much of the theorizing which has focused on sources of religious commitment because it presupposes a religious-based moral order. That is, it assumes that traditional religious norms and values are both plausible to and widely shared by societal members. For example, deprivation theory maintains that those occupying certain statuses (e.g., women, the elderly, and lower class individuals) will turn to religion to compensate for deprivation experienced as a result of occupying those statuses. At least in part, the adequacy of this ex- planation rests on the assumption that all deprived segments of society find a religious perspective to be plausible. Siding with such writers as Eister (1957), Fenn (1970, 1972), and Luckmann (1967), Roof takes the position that with increasing secularization, a religion- based moral order can no longer be taken for granted.

Indeed, religion is only one of many institutions which of- fer meaning systems. Correspondingly, the plausibility of traditional religious belief systems has declined, making it necessary for an adequate theory of religious commitment to treat the issue of plausibility as problematic. Drawing on Berger's (1967) notion of plausibility structure, Roof (1976, 1978) contended that belief systems must be socially supported if they are to retain their plausibility. More specifically, one must be integrated into interaction net- works of individuals who share his/her beliefs and world views. These networks (plausibility structures) confirm or reinforce the individual's definitions of reali- ty, ensuring that they remain subjectively meaningful. Since it can no longer be assumed that plausibility structures for religion permeate the entire socie- ty, one must identify segments of society where these structures still operate if religious commitment in contemporary society is to be understood. Roof argued that an important sphere which continues to serve as a plausibility struc- ture for traditional religion (as well as other forms of traditionality) is the local community. Consequently, local community attachment is seen as a primary source of religious commitment. This attachment is seen to vary on a local-cosmopolitan continuum which assesses an individual's orientation to his/her immediate social environment, as opposed to the broader society. "Locals are more attached to their immediate social locale and are quite sensitive to the primary groups in which they interact, such as the family, neighborhood cliques, and community organizations. In con- trast, cosmopolitans have their commitments centered outside the residential community and tend to identify more with abstract, generalized groups that may be spatially remote . . ." (Roof, 1978:41). Relatedly, cosmopolitans possess broader social perspectives (i.e., greater "breadth of perspective") than do locals, whose social experiences and world views, being rooted in their im- mediate communities, tend to be narrowly defined and highly traditional. The local-cosmopolitan distinction is not new to sociology. Merton (1957), Gouldner (1957-58), Dye (1963), and others employed the distinction in efforts to understand differences in such things as life-styles, professional orientations of college professors, and political ideologies. However, Roof was the first to introduce the distinction as an explanatory variable in understanding differences in religious commitment. The implications the distinction has for understanding the belonging compo- nent of religious commitment (i.e., religious participation) are at least twofold. First, locals are well-integrated into community-based primary groups, which have traditionally supported religious norms (e.g., families, kinships, and ethnic groups). Thus, locals are more exposed to and subject to the influence of norms and sanctions which encourage religious participation. Second, local religious organizations offer settings in which informal, communal relations, which are highly valued by locals, can be developed. Thus, one would expect religious par- ticipation to be greater among locals than among cosmopolitans. The local-cosmopolitan distinction also has implications for the meaning com- ponent of religion (i.e., subjective, personal aspects of commitment). Since locals and cosmopolitans have different life-styles and social experiences, they develop</page><page sequence="3">Community and Commitment Among Catholics 99 different meaning systems and interpretations of social reality. An important difference between the two groups is the extent to which they personalize their interpretations of social experiences. Locals rely heavily upon interpersonal norms in interpreting such experiences, and thus view them in a highly per- sonalized, concrete manner which is relevant to their lives. Roof (1978:45) il- lustrated this, for example, by pointing out that locals see international rela- tions as analogous to interpersonal relations and the national debt as analogous to an individual's debt. By comparison, cosmopolitans are cognitively oriented to a world of structural relations in the larger society and more predisposed toward impersonal, universalistic values and interpretations. With respect to religious beliefs, the implication here is clear. Locals tend to personalize their con- ceptions of reality in such a way that they probably find literal, otherworldly beliefs about the Deity far more acceptable than do cosmopolitans. They are predisposed to rely more upon anthropomor- phic conceptions of God and to hold simple, unsophisticated supernatural beliefs. For this reason literal orthodox doctrines and beliefs should possess a plausibility of meaning among locals unknown to those oriented to a broader, more secular world (Roof 1978:45). Roof further explicated the implications of the local-cosmopolitan distinction for the meaning component: "Literal and rigid [religious] views on [the part of locals] may reflect a lack of capacity for complex symbolization; but because such beliefs are congruent with their traditional life-styles, locals probably ex- perience fewer cognitive strains than do cosmopolitans. Fewer strains should manifest themselves in adherence to orthodox beliefs, greater personal religiosi- ty, and less doubt" (Roof 1978:50). Clearly, then, Roof's theory implicates local-cosmopolitan orientation (localism) as an antecedent of both the belonging and the meaning aspects of religious commitment. In addition, his theory specifies the role localism plays as a mediator of the effects of several well documented correlates of religious commitment, specifically community size, length of residence, and education. Localism mediates the effects of community size on commitment because large cities provide social milieus which are supportive of nontraditional values and life-styles. Urban dwellers are more exposed to and have greater opportunities to adopt broadened social perspectives which transcend narrow, particularistic concerns. In other words, urban living facilitates a more cosmopolitan orienta- tion which, in turn, undermines traditional religious commitment. Length of residence is relevant to commitment because the longer individuals reside in a given community, the more likely they are to develop attachments to that com- munity and, thus, to possess a localistic perspective. Roof theorized that the effects of community size and length of residence on both the belonging and the meaning aspects of religiosity are largely indirect through localism. Education, however, is theorized to have both direct and in- direct influences on the belonging aspect. Education has an indirect influence because it exposes individuals to new perspectives and values, thereby increas- ing their breadth of perspective or the extent to which their outlook is cosmopolitan. Education's direct influence reflects a "status effect." Higher status individuals tend to be more involved in religious institutions than do lower status individuals, as a symbolic means of representing middle-class position. Since education is an important indicator of social status, it should have a positive effect on religious participation which is not mediated through localism.</page><page sequence="4">100 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Roof's theory is a potentially important contribution to a sociological understanding of individual religiosity. It takes what appears to be a more satisfactory approach to the issue of plausibility than do existing theories of com- mitment, and, in doing so, it directs attention to an untried conceptual variable as a source of commitment. Moreover, it promises to provide insights into the nature of the relationship between religious commitment and several of its cor- relates by outlining the role localism plays in transmitting the effects of these correlates. Surprisingly, very little research has been designed to test Roof's theory. In both a sample of Southern Baptists (Roof, 1972) and a sample of Episcopalians (Roof, 1976, 1978), Roof found the expected positive relationship between localism and several meaning and belonging measures of religious commitment. Fur- thermore, in the Episcopalian sample, Roof empirically assessed localism's role as a mediator of the effects of community size, length of residence, and educa- tion. Localism mediated nearly all of the effects of community size and length of residence on both the belonging and meaning measures of commitment, and education had the predicted direct and indirect effects on the belonging measures. The purpose of this study is to test local-cosmopolitan theory using a sample of Catholics. Testing Roof's theory among Catholics may be particularly useful in determining its generalizability. Roof's (1978:210-11, 219) major concern lay with the applicability of his theory to mainline Protestant groups, particularly to the more liberal Protestant groups. Catholic, Jewish, and conservative Pro- testant bodies, at least to some degree, have "self-contained natural com- munities" which serve as plausibility structures for religion. In the case of Catholics, whose ethnic and religious identities are inextricably tied, ethnic groups may provide the plausibility structures which maintain religious com- mitment. Since liberal Protestants lack such "natural communities," the local community serves as the plausibility structure and local community reference becomes an important predictor of religiosity. We suspect, however, that local community reference is helpful in understan- ding patterns of religious commitment among Catholics, as well. Like liberal Protestants, Catholics vary in the extent to which they are attached to their local communities, and, to the extent that local communities do provide plausibility structures for traditional religion, it is possible that local Catholics exhibit greater traditional religiosity than do cosmopolitan Catholics. This, of course, is not to say that ethnic groups are unimportant in maintaining religious com- mitment among Catholics, but it is important to recognize that ethnic groups are local communal structures. Therefore, it is quite possible that local at- tachments reinforce religious commitment among Catholics, as well as among liberal Protestants. Furthermore, it seems likely that cosmopolitan-oriented Catholics do not feel particularly bound by the traditions of their ethnic groups or local communities. Cosmopolitan Catholics, like cosmopolitan members of liberal Protestant groups, are oriented to the broader, secular society, and therefore are probably less sensitive to primary group expectations, whether these expectations emanate from ethnic groups or other community-based primary groups.</page><page sequence="5">Community and Commitment Among Catholics 101 The differing cognitive styles of locals and cosmopolitans may also have im- plications for the applicability of Roof's theory to Catholics. If, as Roof's theory suggests, people with limited social perspectives are disposed to endorse per- sonalized, anthropomorphic religious imageries, it seems that this would be true regardless of religious affiliation. It is doubtful that cosmopolitan Catholics, with their greater breadth of perspective, would be any more likely than cosmopolitan Protestants to derive a "plausibility of meaning" from simple, unsophisticated supernatural beliefs. Such beliefs would probably be far more congruent with the traditional life-styles and social experiences of local Catholics, producing fewer cognitive strains for them than for cosmopolitan Catholics. In any case, testing localism theory among Catholics is an important initial step in deter- mining its generalizability. Both belief and behavioral measures of religiosity are included as dependent variables in this study. Several of the measures assess general Christian beliefs and behaviors (literal orthodoxy, church attendance, and private prayer), and several assess beliefs and behaviors unique to, or at least more central to, Catholicism (belief in the infallibility of the pope, receiving Holy Communion, and going to confession). In addition, two "image of God" belief measures are included. One (supernatural determinism) assesses the extent to which one believes that worldly events are controlled by God, and the other (divine or- dination of social arrangements) assesses the extent to which one believes that existing (unequal) social arrangements are ordained by God. These two measures were included because they may be particularly responsive to dif- ferences in local and cosmopolitan cognitive styles. Both images of God imply the existence of a very personal, anthropomorphic being who is not only active- ly involved in human affairs, but who actually regulates them. In modern, secular society, it is doubtful that cosmopolitans, with their broader social perspectives and preferences for abstract conceptualizations, could find such views of God tenable or meaningful. Methods Sample. To obtain the data for this analysis, questionnaires were mailed to a sample of 1,036 adult Catholics living in the western third of Tennessee. The sam- ple was systematically drawn in the summer of 1981 from a newsletter mailing list provided by the Memphis diocese. This list contains the names of virtually all registered Catholics in west Tennessee. In an effort to maximize the response rate, Dillman's (1978) four-stage mailing and follow-up procedure was used This procedure yielded 797 usable questionnaires which, after subtracting "undeliverable" and "deceased" categories, reflects a 79.5 percent response rate. Since Roof (1976, 1978) excluded nonwhites from the analysis of his Episcopalian data, nonwhites were also excluded from this analysis to help en- sure that the findings of the two studies are as comparable as possible. This resulted in 727 respondents. Since the sample for this study was drawn in the South (where religious com- mitment is generally assumed to be high) and since the sample consists of registered Catholics (i.e., Catholics who are on official church membership rolls), the respondents are likely to be more strongly committed than are</page><page sequence="6">102 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Catholics in the general population. Evidence of this is the fact that the respondents in this study tended to score higher on behavioral measures of religiosity than did the respondents in Greeley's (1977) nationwide probability sample of Catholics. For example, Greeley reported that 50 percent of the respondents in his study attended mass "every week" and 12 percent attended "practically never" or "not at all." In this study, 67 percent claimed weekly attendance and only seven percent indicated that they attended mass "several times a year" or "never." Greeley also reported that 60 percent of his respondents prayed every day and four percent never prayed; the correspon- ding figures for this study are 69 percent and one percent, respectively. Although the respondents in this study apparently are more committed than are Catholics in general, that they are registered Catholics and were drawn from a southern population helps ensure that the sample is comparable to Roof's Episcopalian and Baptist samples. Roof's samples were also drawn from a southern population (North Carolina) and included only church members. Thus, neither Roof's samples nor the current sample included people who were not on church membership rolls. Measurement. The exogenous variables in this study include total education, length of residence in the present community, size of hometown, and propor- tion of total education received in Catholic school. Total education and length of residence were measured in actual years. Size of hometown was measured on an eight-point scale which ranged from "farm" to "city of a million or more persons." Proportion of total education received in Catholic school was measured by dividing years of Catholic education by total years of education. Size of hometown is used instead of size of present city (which is the variable used in Roof's Episcopalian study) because of certain geographic restrictions of the sample. The sample includes Catholics living in the western third of Ten- nessee, which tends to be culturally homogeneous and which has only one metropolitan area (Memphis). Moreover, over 76 percent of the respondents reside in Memphis. Thus, the variance associated with size of present city is highly restricted, which limits this variable's ability to explain variation in localism. The logic of Roof's theory appears to implicate size of hometown as an antecedent of localism for essentially the same reason it implicates size of present city. Individuals raised in urban areas, like individuals currently liv- ing in urban areas, have experienced greater exposure to broadened social perspectives than those raised in rural areas. Consequently, size of hometown, which has substantially greater variance than size of present city, is used in this analysis. Proportion of total education received in Catholic school is included as a con- trol variable. Since Catholic schools are concerned with inculcating religious values (which may affect one's breadth of perspective) and since the effects of Catholic education on various dimensions of religiosity are well-documented (Greeley and Rossi, 1966; Greeley et al., 1976), it seems relevant to control for the Catholic school influence. In many studies, the Catholic school influence is controlled for by simply including years of Catholic school and years of total education as independent variables in the same regression equation. This seems inadvisable, however, since there is considerable overlap between the two variables. All respondents who received all their education in Catholic schools</page><page sequence="7">Community and Commitment Among Catholics 103 receive the same value on both variables, potentially creating multicolineari- ty. This problem is avoided by controlling for proportion of total education receiv- ed in Catholic schools (as is the case in this study) instead of years of Catholic education. The intervening variable, local-cosmopolitan orientation, was measured with three of the localism items included in Roof's Episcopalian survey. These items are: (1) Big cities may have their place, but the local community is the backbone of America. (2) When it comes to choosing someone for a responsible public office in my community, I prefer a person whose family is known and well-established. (3) Despite all the newspaper and TV coverage, national and international events rarely seem as interesting as events that occur right in the local community in which one lives. For each item, responses were assessed on a four-point scale, which ranged from "agree strongly" to "disagree strongly." As was true of Roof's (1976:200) study, these items were randomly distributed throughout the questionnaire to minimize the possibility of a response-set bias. The scale points on these items were coded so that higher scores indicate greater localism. These scores were then summed to create the composite scale, which ranged from 3 to 12 (Corn- bach's alpha = .653 for these items). Integers nearest the mean values were substituted for missing data in this and all other scales that were created by combining items. The frequency distribution for the localism scale was skewed in the direction of local responses. Forty-five percent of the respondents scored from 9 to 12 on this scale; 34 percent scored from 7 to 8; 21 percent scored from 3 to 6. In Roof's study, a fourth item was included in the localism index: "The most rewarding organizations a person can belong to are the large, state and nation- wide associations rather than local community clubs and activities." This item was also included in the current study. However, it evidenced essentially no cor- relation with the other three items, and in a factor analysis, it failed to load on the same factor with them. Furthermore, when the item was included with the other independent variables in regression equations, it had inconsequential ef- fects on the religiosity measures. Consequently, the item is excluded from this analysis. Interestingly, Roof and Perkins (1975) excluded this item from the localism scale in their study of salience in religious commitment. Literal orthodoxy was measured with the same index used in Roof's survey. This index included four items, each of which consists of a list of traditional (or- thodox) and nontraditional statements concerning a specific area of Christian beliefs. These areas include (1) the nature of God, (2) the divinity of Jesus, (3) the meaning of the words Heaven and Hell, and (4) the Bible. Respondents were asked to select from each list the statement which comes closest to their own belief. For each item, respondents who selected a traditional statement receiv- ed a value of 2; respondents who selected a nontraditional statement received a value of 1 (see Roof, 1978:221-22, 231-33 for the list of statements associated with each item and for coding information). Summing the values across the four items resulted in a five-point scale which ranged from 4 to 8; higher scores in- dicate greater orthodoxy. Cornbach's alpha for these items was .671.</page><page sequence="8">104 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Belief in the infallibility of the pope was measured with a single item which read, "Under certain conditions, the Pope is infallible when he speaks on mat- ters of faith and morals" (Greeley et al., 1976). Divine ordination of social ar- rangements was also measured with a single item: "One reason there are still so many poor people in America is because God gave people different abilities so the work of the world will get done" (Piazza and Glock, 1979). Responses to both items were assessed on four-point scales ranging from "disagree strong- ly" (coded 1) to "agree strongly" (coded 4). Supernatural determinism was measured with two items. One read, "Nothing happens in this world unless God wills it," and the other read, "God has a plan for this world and everything that happens to us is part of this plan." Again, responses were assessed on four-point scales ranging from "disagree strong- ly" (coded 1) to "agree strongly" (coded 4). The Pearson correlation between these two items was .641. To crea te the final index, the scale points were summed. Finally, all the behavioral measures of religiosity (frequency of mass atten- dance, receiving Holy Communion, going to confession, and private prayer) were measured on six-point scales which ranged from "never" (coded 1) to "every day" (coded 6). Since Roof's theory implicates localism as an intervening variable between several background and religiosity variables, path analysis was employed to analyze the data. The decomposition of effects method proposed by Alwin and Hauser (1975) was used to obtain total, direct, and indirect effects. The bivariate correlations, means, and standard deviations for all variables are reported in Table 1. Findings The path model to be tested is presented in Figure 1. The standardized regres- sion coefficients indicating the strength of the effects of the exogenous variables on localism are also presented. Generally speaking, the findings support Roof's theory. As expected, education and size of hometown have negative effects on localism (-.216 and -.125, respectively) and length of residence has a positive effect (.099). Although the effects of length of residence and size of hometown are small, they are statistically significant at conventional levels. The total effects of the exogenous variables on the four belief measures of religiosity are decomposed into their direct and indirect components in Table 2. Consistent with Roof's theory, localism has a positive direct effect on each belief variable. Its effects on supernatural determinism and divine ordination of social arrangements are appreciable (.240 and .237, respectively). Indeed, localism is a substantially better predictor of both of these variables than any other variables included in the analysis. Localism fares less well in predicting literal orthodoxy (.146) and papal infallibility (.133); however, in both instances the effect is highly significant (p &lt; .001). Roof found in his Episcopalian survey that education's direct effect on or- thodoxy was stronger than its indirect effect (Roof, 1976:205, 1978:123). This fin- ding is echoed in this study. In fact, education's direct effect on each of the belief variables except papal infallibility is larger than its indirect effect. Whether con- sidering total, direct, or indirect effects, education's effects on papal infallibili-</page><page sequence="9">Table 1.

Localism plays its most important role as an interven- ing variable in mediating the effects of education on supernatural determinism and on divine ordination of social arrangements. Localism mediates nearly 45 percent of education's total effect on supernatural determinism (i.e., -.052/-.116 = .448) and 30.5 percent of its total effect on the divine ordination variable. On- ly 16.6 percent of education's total effect on orthodoxy is mediated via localism. Inconsistent with Roof's Episcopalian findings, the direct effects of length of residence are stronger than its indirect effects, regardless of which belief variable is considered. In several cases, the difference is substantial. For ex- ample, 91.9 percent of the total effect of length of residence on orthodoxy and 93.5 percent of its total effect on papal infallability is direct. Similarly, the direct effects of size of hometown tend to be stronger than its indirect effects. Nearly 74 percent of its total effect on supernatural determinism and nearly 84 percent of its total effect on papal infallability is direct. The total, direct, and indirect effects of size of hometown on the divine ordination variable and on orthodoxy are negligible. The total effects of the exogenous variables on the four behavior measures of religiosity are decomposed into their direct and indirect components in Table 3. The most striking finding apparent in this table is that localism has essen- tially no effect on attendance at mass (.020), receiving Holy Communion (.016), and private prayer (-.009).

Consequently, localism does not mediate the effects of the exogenous variables; any effects that these variables have are almost entirely direct. All four of the exogenous variables have significant direct effects on at- tendance at mass, and education and length of residence have significant direct effects on receiving Holy Communion. The only variable which has a signifi- cant direct effect on going to confession is length of residence. Three of the ex- ogenous variables (education, size of hometown, and length of residence) have significant effects on private prayer. Discussion The findings of this study support the aspect of local-cosmopolitan theory which links religious beliefs to localism. Localism had a significant positive effect on each of the four belief items included in the analysis. Moreover, it played a role in mediating the effects of education, length of residence, and size of hometown on the belief measures. However, its importance in this regard should not be overemphasized. While it is true that each exogenous variable (except propor- tion of total education received in Catholic school) had a significant effect on localism, which in turn had a significant effect on each belief item, the indirect effects of the exogenous variables were typically quite small and weaker than their direct effects. The expectation that localism would be helpful in predic- ting religious behavior was not supported. Localism had inconsequential effects on all the behavioral variables and thus played no role in mediating the effects of the exogenous variables. Localism's negligible effects on private prayer and going to confession are perhaps explainable when one considers the very private nature of these prac- tices. Generally speaking, these practices are not subject to the scrutiny or sanc- tions of one's locally based primary groups. Thus, one would not necessarily expect these practices to be particularly responsive to variation in local at- tachments. Indeed, in Roof's Episcopalian study, localism proved to be less ef- fective in predicting private devotion than it was in predicting beliefs and public forms of religiosity. It should be emphasized that religious beliefs are also private aspects of religion. However, Roof's theory implicates localism as an antece- dent of beliefs, not so much because of primary group pressures for conformity (although such pressures may play a role), but because limited social ex- periences dispose locals to personalize their interpretations of reality in such a way that they find unsophisticated, anthropomorphic religious beliefs more credible than do cosmopolitans. Furthermore, such beliefs produce fewer cognitive strains for locals than for cosmopolitans since the beliefs are more congruent with the traditional life-styles of locals. The finding that localism has negligible effects on attendance at mass and receiving Holy Communion is surprising, particularly since Roof (1976, 1978) found localism to be a much better predictor of measures of religious participa- tion (particularly church attendance) than any of the other religiosity variables in his study. These practices, being public in nature, definitely are subject to primary group pressures. At least two possible explanations may account for localism's negligible effects in this study. First, as Roof suggested, perhaps</page><page sequence="14">110 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY among Catholics "natural communities," formed as a result of ethnic group ties, are capable of maintaining institutional commitment. However, this explana- tion assumes that cosmopolitan Catholics, even though they are oriented to the broader, secular society, are just as sensitive to ethnic group expectations as are locally oriented Catholics. An alternative explanation takes into account recent changes in the Catholic Church and the possible consequences these changes have had for the types of people who can derive a plausibility of meaning from Catholicism. In an attempt to modernize the church, the Second Vatican Council, 1962-65, initiated far- reaching changes, which resulted in significant departures from traditional Catholic teachings and practices. The changes not only altered what went on within the church (e.g., English instead of Latin mass, fewer liturgical activities, and lay people distributing communion), they also encouraged ecumenism and signaled greater theological pluralism and broadened religious interests (Faase, 1980; Hoge, 1981; Koller, 1979). Generally speaking, the pre-Vatican II church can be characterized as highly authoritarian, with a hierarchical order of the sacred and formalized rules and rituals defining "proper" religious behavior. The post-Vatican II church has taken on a more democratic character, encourag- ing greater lay participation and allowing individual Catholics more freedom to construct their own religious meanings. Another important change in the church, although not necessarily resulting from Vatican II, has been its increas- ing involvement in world affairs. In recent years, the Catholic Church has been highly visible in its attempts to bring about humanitarian social and economic changes on an international basis. In other words, Catholicism itself has become more open and cosmopolitan, particularly in its intellectual and social perspectives. In the process, it is possible that it has become more relevant to the experiences and concerns of cosmopolitans. This is not to suggest that the Catholic Church is now a haven for people who do not feel particularly bound by cultural traditions. The church's stance on such issues as birth control, abortion, and the ordination of women priests remains traditional. In fact, its stance on birth control is perhaps the major cause of apostacy from the church in recent years (Greeley et al., 1976). Nevertheless, it seems likely that the changes which have occurred have created an environment in which cosmopolitans are now better able to derive plausibility of meaning. On the other hand, it is possible that the changes have made the church less relevant to the life-styles and concerns of the more traditional- oriented locals. Not only has the church departed from centuries of tradition, it has created an environment of continued (and perhaps even institutionaliz- ed) change (Kim, 1980). It is doubtful that such an environment is capable of providing religious meaning for locals, who tend to view the world in fixed, ab- solute terms (Roof, 1978:46). If this is true, localism's inconsequential effects on attendance at mass and receiving Holy Communion are understandable. The changes may have weaken- ed locals' commitment to the institutional life of the church, while strengthen- ing that of cosmopolitans; consequently, any differences between the two are attenuated. While this explanation is admittedly post hoc and speculative, it does account for why, among Catholics, localism is capable of explaining variance in religious</page><page sequence="15">Community and Commitment Among Catholics 111 beliefs but not in institutional commitment. Religious beliefs, being a more private aspect of religion, are less dependent upon the direction of institutional change. Such change may weaken (or strengthen) one's commitment to the in- stitution without affecting the content of one's private religious beliefs, which, according to localism theory, depends more upon one's breadth of perspective and disposition to personalize interpretations of reality. Although the findings of this study should be viewed with caution, they have important implications for the generalizability of local-cosmopolitan theory beyond mainline Protestant groups. If one's concern is to predict institutional commitment, this study provides no evidence that the localism construct has predictive utility in the case of Catholics. It should be stressed, however, that localism's failure to predict this type of commitment among Catholics does not necessarily mean that the underlying propositions of Roof's theory are invalid. Instead, it may mean that one must carefully consider what implications these propositions have for predicting institutional commitment when change within an institution alters its ability to provide religious meaning for people with dif- fering breadths of perspective. If this change undermines tradition, localism theory would not necessarily predict that locals, being tradition-oriented, are more committed than cosmopolitans. If one's concern is to predict anthropomorphic supernatural beliefs, this study suggests that the utility of the localism construct is not confined to mainline Pro- testants. Obviously, this study has not demonstrated that the logic of Roof's theory, which links religious beliefs to localism, can be applied to any religious group. Furthermore, since the sample for this study was drawn from only one diocese located in the South, future research needs to test localism theory us- ing more diverse samples of Catholics. Nevertheless, the fact that the logic of localism theory which links religious beliefs to localism has been helpful in predicting the beliefs of Catholics in this study suggests that this logic has wider applicability than was originally assumed. Hopefully, future research will test localism theory using other religious groups, so the credibility of the theory and the limits of its generalizability can be more clearly established.
