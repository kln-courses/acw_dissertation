<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bewildering: Paul de Man, Poetry, Politics * Kevin Newmark It is no easy task to determine the proper place of the "political" within the writings of Paul de Man. The difficulties inherent in the question stem not so much from the absence of references to history and politics in his writing - on the contrary; it is a rare text that does not mention law, politics, economics, social unrest, war, or revolution. The problem arises instead from the way such references can become intelligible only in the context of analyses that are themselves not in the first place either historical or political. What one does not find in de Man's archive - at least not in the one composed after the war - is a consideration of the political that would not first have to address complications that are specifically textual, and that have to do with literary concerns on the one hand and philosophical ones on the other, or in somewhat more restricted terminology, with rhetoric and epistemology. "One should . . . not forget," de Man warns character- istically about proceeding too quickly from literary critical analysis to critique of ideology, "that we are dealing with textual models, not with the historical and political systems that are their correlate."1 As a "correlate" of the textual models from which it necessarily derives, whatever is properly political is therefore not accessible to thought in any direct or immediate fashion. Rather, genuinely historical, political and ideological questions - and it would be worth asking whether and to what extent de Man conceives of the possibility of separating any one from its necessary intertwining with the others - can be effectively and legitimately addressed only on the far side of a critical-linguistic analysis of concepts. And these concepts will always be conditioned MLN 124 (2009): 1048-1071 © 2010 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">MLN 1049 by textual features that are both rhetorical and epistemological in nature. A case in point is provided by the opening of the essay "Hegel on the Sublime," where de Man economically spells out both the impera- tive of treating literary, philosophical, and political issues together and the unwarranted tendency to introduce into the mix principles of exclusion that would somehow isolate the literary from either contaminating, or being contaminated by, the all-important coordina- tion between the other two. The conclusion de Man draws here, and which he inscribes within a "tradition" of thinkers stretching from Kant to Hegel, Marx, Adorno, Benjamin, Althusser and Derrida, is that the trajectory that joins intellectual discourse to political action must inevitably pass by way of the aesthetic category in which the confrontation with literature is impossible to avoid. Therefore, and despite the near-mechanical regularity of such reductive gestures, no valorization of aesthetic experience at the expense of either epistemo- logical or political considerations, nor any dismissal of the category of the aesthetic as an autonomous and thus self-reflexive totality having no impact on the others, could ever succeed in achieving its stated aims. A given philosophical thinker, de Man observes laconically, "is politically effective because of, and not in spite of his concentration on literary texts."2 If you want to think productively about genuine political activity, that is, if you want to bring thought together with action, he seems to be saying, you should go read some more fiction! Can such a suggestion be taken seriously? This is the kind of baffling statement that is upsetting for our most familiar understanding of both literature and politics. Upsetting enough, de Man argues, that rather than face up to its challenge, we will resort to numberless strategies in order to dismiss it outright, ignore it politely, or domesticate it into the kind of reassuring schémas that pretend to restore us to a sense of philosophical and ideological equilibrium. As luck would have it, one means of escape from this dilemma is obligingly offered by a remark de Man himself makes in connection to the very argument which, in "Hegel on the Sublime," alerts us to the danger of falling prey to the philosophical and political seductive- ness of such schemes. For "Hegel on the Sublime," as is well known, was part of a series of six lectures that de Man delivered at Cornell in February and March of 1983. When he was finished delivering the last lecture, on Walter Benjamin, he granted to Stefano Rosso an interview commissioned by RAJ (Italian Public Service Broadcasts). And in the very last of his responses, de Man addresses the "book" he is at that</page><page sequence="3">1050 KEVIN NEWMARK moment in the process of writing, and to which the essay, "Hegel on the Sublime" would have properly belonged, had this book ever been completed. De Man died in December of that same year, and the six Messenger Lectures, along with the Interview that sealed them, were almost immediately detached from their original context and dissemi- nated among several different published volumes. Two lectures, on Baudelaire and Kleist, were published in The Rhetoric of Romanticism (1984); three lectures, on Kant, Schiller and Hegel, became part of Aesthetic Ideology (1996); the last lecture, on Benjamin, can be found along with the Interview in The Resistance to Theory (1986). Given the circumstances, it is tempting to hear de Man's voice in that final response to Rosso as constituting something like his last word on the subject. And since the subject involves the place of the political in the projected volume, it is all the more understandable that we would look to this remark as a key to de Man's own perception of what he had been able to accomplish as a critic and a theorist. "I have the feeling," he says there, "[that] I have achieved some control over technical problems of language, specifically problems of rhetoric . . . I feel now some control of a vocabulary and of a conceptual apparatus that can handle that. It was in working on Rousseau that I felt I was able to progress from purely linguistic analysis to questions which are already of a political and ideological nature . . . ."3 This moment can easily acquire paradigmatic significance, for it appears to correspond to an act of self-reflexive assessment in which de Man turns back to survey his career, summing it up with the full authority that seems to come only from the privileged vantage point of hindsight. The rela- tion between language - conceived extensively enough to include the rhetoric of literature as well as the epistemology of philosophy - and politics, would be fundamentally "historical" in nature. It would mark a passage in the strict sense of the term: a sequential movement that crosses from one moment or point to another in order to join them both together. In this case specifically, it also appears as a progression that passes from the purely linguistic analysis in which it must begin to questions that can later on (already) be ideological and political in nature. Nonetheless, there is something odd, something disconcerting in this affirmation by Paul de Man about finally gaining "control" over rhetoric, about ultimately having made "progress" from purely linguistic analysis to political and ideological questions. It is not just the irony - perhaps unintentional, though with de Man one will never know for sure - in the claim to have gained control over the techni-</page><page sequence="4">MLN 1051 cal problems of language at precisely the moment when he would be compelled to stop writing once and for all, as though he were provid- ing one last, spectacular, example of the way a claim to mastery over rhetoric could coincide only with the death of all writing. Rather, it is the more profound disruption that occurs as soon as one notices, as one must simply by reading de Man, the way that these very words "control" and "progress" are themselves decisive components of "a vocabulary" de Man has just employed in the Messenger Lectures, com- ponents that serve to activate "a conceptual apparatus" that from now on will permit him to "handle . . . the technical problems of language, specifically problems of rhetoric." And once one considers the way this vocabulary of "control" and "progress" functions within de Man's own readings, for instance, to take but one example, in the second of the Messenger Lectures, devoted to Kleist's Über das Marionettentheater, then it becomes strictly impossible to take them at face value. For what would it mean, in the Interview, to gain "control" over the problems of rhetoric that, in Kleist's text, are themselves what always and again account for as well as determine the repetitive "loss of control" that is disclosed by the reading carried out by the lecture? To put the Interview back together with the lecture on Kleist to which it was originally attached serves only to bring out the way the Inter- view begins to resemble the dialogic frame that encloses Kleist's text without in any way managing to gain control over its meaning. As a scene of instruction, moreover, the dialogic Interview with de Man is highly satisfying - if not nearly as entertaining as the lecture - in its capacity to formulate its intended meaning with the kind of economy and clarity that is only too distressingly missing from the lecture.4 But since the lecture on Kleist - despite all its vertiginous twists and turns - finally reveals just how dubious is the authority on which such staged scenes of teaching ultimately rest, one would, like the character named K in Kleist's fiction, in fact, have to be rather absent-minded or "distracted" - zerstreut - not to suspect at this point a discrepancy between what the Interview says about de Man's authority and what his readings actually do with it. De Man's recourse to a vocabulary of control and progress at the conclusion of his lectures therefore resembles nothing so much as the teleological conclusion that seems to be reached at the end of Kleist's text, and about which de Man himself says: "within the bewildering and mystifying context, it provides an enclave of familiarity, an anchor of the commonplace in the midst of an uncanny scene of extravagance and paradox. It [is] very easy to forget how little this pseudo-conclusion has to do with the rest . . .</page><page sequence="5">1052 KEVIN NEWMARK and how derisively ungermane it is to the implications of what comes before" (268). In the case of Paul de Man, of course, "what comes before" the teleological pseudo-conclusion of the Interview is the set of six readings that are enacted by the lectures. And the story they tell about the relation between language and politics is anything but a simple narrative of gaining control and making progress - especially over the technical problems of language. If it remains nevertheless true and inevitable that the mutually determining relation between rhetoric, epistemology, and politics can become accessible only in the mode of a passage, then it will be precisely the "vocabulary" and the "conceptual apparatus" - in other words the rhetoric and the epistemology - of the passage that will constitute the main burden of situating the political in de Man's writings. If there is a thread that weaves its way through each of the six Mes- senger Lectures and then stitches them all together, it would indeed appear in the generalized principle of articulation. Articulation is what binds the various members of the puppet's body together in Kleist's Marionettentheater, as is evident in the compound noun Gliedermann used to name him, and it serves as an overarching figure for joining the entire set of de Man's lectures into something of an "unpublished manuscript" in its own right. Scattered like the fragments of a broken jug or amphora, the six lectures and Interview still bear the marks of a virtual volume from which they will have been detached, testifying by the same token to the future possibility of gluing them all back together again. Such a potential for articulation indeed becomes crucial for an understanding of the final lecture on Benjamin's "Task of the Translator," where de Man deliberately introduces it to convey the sense Benjamin is seeking to attach to - what else could it possibly be - the metaphor of a broken vessel (RT 90) I It accounts, moreover, for de Man's recurrent interest in Kant's third Critique as the point of articulation between theoretical and practical reason, or between cognition and free will. It is as well what determines de Man's analysis of Hegel's Aesthetics, and within the Aesthetics the problematic place of the sublime, as "the passage" from objective to absolute spirit, or the articulation between politics, art, and philosophy. Finally, it sup- plies the inaugural gesture to the opening lecture on Baudelaire, which specifies this question as "the link" between epistemology and rhetoric, a question that is persistently carried out in philosophical texts from Kant to Nietzsche, and that manifests itself in Baudelaire's famous sonnet, "Correspondances," as the implied project to achieve a "seamless articulation, by ways of language, of sensory and aesthetic</page><page sequence="6">MLN 1053 experience with . . . intellectual assurance" (RR 244). If the passage from language to history and politics always ends up in de Man's writ- ing as the critical analysis of articulation, this should come as no great shock, for language is articulation and nothing else.5 But in that case, what actually occurs - in Kant or in Kleist, in Hegel, Baudelaire, or Benjamin - when the articulation that is language makes its obliga- tory passage to understanding and history, or to epistemology, politics and ideology? A possible response to this question takes a hint from the fourth of the Messenger Lectures, on the Sublime in Kant's third Critique.6 From the beginning, the lecture is concerned with the necessarily interdependent relations between substance and structure, or between bodies and their architectonics as well as their mutually determined motions. The question can be taken as yet another version of what we have been calling the passage, or articulation between language, philosophy, and politics considered in themselves as articulated struc- tures or "bodies" that move among and transform each other. The analytic of aesthetic judgment, and within this general division, the section on the sublime, will provide de Man with the means of sug- gesting that Kant has to have recourse to linguistic models in order to resolve the paradoxical relationship between transcendental and metaphysical principles that is always involved here (AI 72-74) . On the one hand, within the section on the mathematical sublime, Kant will try to demonstrate how reason demands that an infinitely large quantity become a sensory intuition in the imagination, or how the formal infinity of number must be articulated with the totality of space in its extension and magnitude (AI 77). According to de Man, this demonstration, which Kant attempts to accomplish in several different ways, cannot become intelligible for thought without first introducing a tropological model in which the rhetorical figure of synecdoche serves as a substitute for the properly philosophical syntheses of apprehen- sion and comprehension which remain as a result beyond the power of the mind to accomplish on its own. In like manner, de Man will take advantage of Kant's consideration of the sublime from both a mathematical and a dynamic point of view to ask whether another linguistic model, alongside the tropological one needed to explain the system of number-extension, will become evident in the case of the system of number-motion. Tropes that take parts for the wholes they cannot in fact ever reach provide a rhetorical passage from the infinity of number to the totality of extension; but what puts the world that is then composed of all these partial bodies into motion?</page><page sequence="7">1054 KEVIN NEWMARK The answer, de Man suggests, can be read in the section on the dynamic sublime, where the exposition introduces at once the notion of might in a quasi-empirical sense of fright, pitting man against nature in a scene of armed combat in which the combined forces of soldiers, diplomats, and generals can then be enlisted in order to declare victory over it. Generals, Kant assures us, are more admirable in the battle to illustrate the dynamic sublime than diplomats - presumably because their power depends less on the back and forth of cognitive argumentation than on their unimpeachable authority to issue com- mands. The enigma posed here becomes legible in a certain ambiguity displayed by Kant's own terminology but not addressed as such at this point: does man have within his power a special force (Kraft) equal to or even greater than the raw power (Macht) of nature, and how could the capacity for aesthetic judgment ( Urteilskraft) be employed to answer such a question? Thus, rather than develop a straightforward philosophical argument from a kinetics of gravitational motion, Kant's treatment of the dynamic sublime, according to de Man, can be fully explained only by expanding the cognitive dimensions of language to include elements of force, violence and imposition (AI 78-79). The analysis of the mathematical and dynamic sublime leads de Man to uncover in each case a function of language that is implied but unacknowledged within the structure and motion of Kant's own text. The knowledge of all bodies, as de Man reads Kant, is not attainable by properly philosophical methods and can be achieved only by means of tropological devices such as synecdoche. Nor can the subsequent motions among themselves of such incomplete and therefore impaired bodies be fully accounted for, de Man argues, by purely physical con- cepts such as gravity, since they are also always subject to a world of other forces that, like the power of performative language, remain free to defy both natural and cognitive restraints. We seem to have reached a provisional conclusion, for at this point in de Man's reading it becomes evident that the challenge of extend- ing philosophical cognition to the totality of the phenomenal world, a challenge always involved in the experience of the sublime, moreover, cannot be met without employing synecdochal tropes that take parts for wholes that for the same reason always turn out to be essentially incomplete. And as a consequence of this epistemological limitation, the practical efficacy required in the world of ethical and political action cannot be achieved without supplementing these pseudo- cognitions with a force that is provided by performative models of language. The proper place of the political - of what happens as both</page><page sequence="8">MLN 1055 history and ideology in the writing of Paul de Man - can therefore be located in the critical analysis of language, and more precisely, as we have just seen in the lecture on Kant, in the passage from a language of tropes as cognition to a language of performance as force. This is of course merely a paraphrase of what de Man himself says in his own attempt to clarify these developments when he returns to them at the beginning of the fifth Messenger Lecture, on Kant and Schiller: "[T]he topic that has emerged . . . has been the question of reversibility . . . linked to the question of historicity .... The model for that ... is the model of the passage from trope, which is a cognitive model, to the performative .... Not the performative in itself .... but the transi- tion, the passage from [one] conception of language ... to another .... And this passage . . . occurs always, and can only occur, by ways of an epistemological critique of trope .... History is therefore . . . the emergence of a language of power out of a language of cognition" (AI 132, 133). This resonates somewhat with what de Man will say later in the Interview, where he speaks of a "critical linguistic analysis" able to treat questions having to do with "the relation between tropes and performatives, of [the] saturation of tropology as a field that in certain forms of language goes beyond that field . . ." (RT 121). But this similarity, as we have also seen, is something of an illusion, since in the lecture de Man is very careful - as he is not in the Interview - to insist that this passage, this movement, this occurrence that is historical, is "something which one could call a progression - though it shouldn't be ... it is not a progression." History, according to de Man, and as we should know by now, is the passage that moves beyond cognition to performance, from thought to actual and therefore political power. But this passage that takes one irreversibly from acts of knowledge to something that actually occurs and does something to change the face of the world as such, is not to be thought of in any way as a progres- sion. How, then, is it to be thought? It is curious, though not without didactic value in its own right, that in the Interview that takes place immediately after the lectures, de Man will relapse into the very vocabulary of "progress" that each of the six Messenger Lectures takes in its own way as the target of an epistemological critique of trope. It suggests that in some sense de Man is not able to read what he has just written into his own text - though it is certainly understandable that after doing all that reading in the lectures he would himself be a little tired or distracted in the conversation with the radio interviewer afterwards. At the very moment that de Man is making history in the lectures, he seems to confuse it</page><page sequence="9">1056 KEVIN NEWMARK ideologically with his own personal progress in the Interview, since, as he has taught us, ideology is precisely that which prevents one from reading. On the other hand, what is truly perplexing is not the way that de Man himself falls into this trap; since by itself that would be of merely contingent interest, but rather the way the lectures themselves argue that this particular relapse into ideology is inevitable from the moment history actually occurs. One rather compact instance of the argument can be found in the prologue to the first Messenger lecture, "Anthropomorphism and Trope in Baudelaire."7 Working from a truncated version of Nietzsche's well-known but less well understood question/assertion, "What then is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomor- phisms . . . ," de Man neatly condenses the analysis he will work out in much more detail from Kant's third Critique. First, he identifies metaphor and metonymy as rhetorical tropes, an identification which allows him to read Nietzsche's qualification of truth as "an army of metaphors and metonymies" to mean that it is a coordinated collection, or system, of tropological displacements between any given subject, such as truth itself, and its potentially endless expansion into different but related predicates. Truth is in this way the straightforward possibil- ity of definition by means of an infinitely varied set of propositional substitutions among its own terms. To read Nietzsche's sentence closely is therefore to conclude that truth is a trope, though there is at this point nothing inherently disruptive in the idea that truth, like any other trope, moreover, has to involve motions that avoid being merely tautological in nature. The passage in Nietzsche's sentence to anthro- pomorphism from trope, however, alters the formal definition of truth as trope to include a new determination of a specific kind of empirical entity. In distinction to trope, the term anthropomorphism implies the prior existence of human-like beings whose potential to engage in substitutions and exchanges among themselves and others - both anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic others - can always be challenged, defended, or imposed on the basis of whatever has been taken to constitute the "human" in the first place. When truth moves beyond being tropological - as it must in order to know anything more than its own purely formal consistency - it generates values (ideologies) that are then subject to struggle among their competing claims and forces - only one of which is grounded in cognition. This, then, is the moment in de Man's miniature critical-linguistic analysis of Nietzsche's sentence fragment that history can be said to occur, when a language of cognition makes the passage to a language of power.</page><page sequence="10">MLN 1057 Hence, also at this point, the double reading that is required by the qualifier and noun "mobile army." The army of cognition is a rhetori- cal army of tropes', but the army of force can always be an actual army of anthropomorphic troops. The cognitive "mobility" of metaphori- cal figures is by no means equivalent to the tactical "movement" of personnel units. The single noun "army" thus relates to its objective correlatives - tropes and anthropomorphisms - in two entirely incom- patible ways. The truth of history and politics emerges at the precise moment that, thanks to the reading, the army of troops is mobilized from out of the moving collection of tropes, that is, when strategies involving the deployment of actual force go beyond the synthesiz- ing motions of cognition, and when the stage is then set for a battle between radically asymmetrical powers. What interests us in the pres- ent case is de Man's conclusion: "How the two modes of power could exist side by side certainly baffles the mind, if not the grammar of Nietzsche's tale" (RR 243). We begin to suspect why reading de Man regularly turns out to be such a perplexing experience. The articula- tion, the putting side by side of cognition and performance that is the mind in action is said here to baffle the same mind through which alone they can appear and be understood in their very difference from each other. The passage from epistemology to politics, from tropes to performance, and that passes through language, is said to baffle the grammatical articulations of the tale whose principal objective is to convey this necessity with all possible clarity. Rather than providing us with a genuine conclusion, then, de Man's reading points in fact to the obligation of retracing a path to what could only be called another starting point. For the coming together in history of cognitive with performative language that eventually baffles both the mind and the grammar of all possible narratives must itself form a residue in which this very failure to understand and to narrate is in its turn marked or articulated, and obviously not just in the ideological mode of a new narrative about history. If history, and a fortiori the political, must be thought as occurrence, as de Man never tires of reminding us, then it will have to leave a material trace wherever and whenever it can be said to have actually happened. De Man himself tells us that this happens - it always happens and has to happen - only by way of an epistemological critique of trope; for instance when, as in the reading of Nietzsche, the notion of truth as trope is pushed to the breaking point, and when something other than tropes, such as the anthropomorphic figures in this example, suddenly emerge from the closed system of formal substitutions. Our</page><page sequence="11">1058 KEVIN NEWMARK question now becomes: how exactly in the writing of Paul de Man is this passage beyond trope itself marked out or articulated? Where is it in the writing of Paul de Man that the emergence of a language of power from a language of cognition can be said to occur as an actual event in its own right? The answer leads back to a formulation that recurs variously throughout the Messenger Lectures as a kind of refrain. "The bottom line," de Man insists at the end of the fourth lecture, "in Kant as well as in Hegel" - but this "bottom line" is also written into the lectures on Baudelaire, Kleist, and Benjamin - "is the prosaic materiality of the letter" (90). The shift from a tropological to a different mode of language effected through epistemological critique must itself be articulated in such a way as to leave its mark on the world, though not simply in the mode of either tropological or performative structures of language. The name de Man gives to this marked articulation that he also calls history is curiously enough the letter, or more precisely, the prosaic materiality of the letter. History in de Man is prosaic because it should always be read according to the letter - à la lettre as it were and as they say in French. This implies, among other things, that "history" is itself a loaded term that can always be understood and/ or performed in all kinds of mutually incompatible ways, many or even most of which are at the furthest remove from what Paul de Man calls actual history, much less its genuinely material and political dimensions. When practical action loses touch with cognitive analysis, history becomes pure ideology and power politics. But when cogni- tion attempts to by-pass the question of its own ideological potential it collapses into an idealism that is all too easily reappropriated by precisely those ideologies it refuses to acknowledge and thus fails to engage historically. Only when history is maintained within the inextricable knot of its cognitive and performative dimensions does it become history à la lettre for de Man, that is, history as it necessarily occurs in the passage from knowledge to action, and that also leaves a material trace on the world it therefore changes. This trace is in the same way and for the same reasons what de Man calls the prosaic materiality of the letter that alone articulates and thus archives the passage into history as writing. To ask about the political archive in de Man is therefore to ask how the political dimension of history can itself occur, or happen, only in such a paradoxical mode; that is, only as an event that is both singu- lar in its coming to pass and infinitely repeatable in the written trace</page><page sequence="12">MLN 1059 its passage will as a consequence have left on the world.8 We are led, then, from our earlier question - how does the passage from trope to performance occur in the writing of Paul to de Man - to a new question: in the materiality of what letter does this passage to history in its properly political and ideological dimension leave its mark on de Man's own text? One possible response can again be found in the fourth Messenger Lecture, "Kant on the Sublime." According to the logic of de Man's reading, and as he spells it out in the following lecture on "Kant and Schiller," it is in the shift from the mathematical to the dynamic sublime, in the passage from a tropological to a performative model of language, that the occurrence of history can be located in the third Critique. "One could say," de Man jokes in the Schiller lecture two days later, referring to the singularity of this event in Kant's text, "that in the whole reception of Kant from then until now, nothing has happened, nothing at all" (AI 134). What is odd, however, and well worth remarking, is the way that de Man's reading does not come to a stop at that point, in other words, it in no way concludes with the identification of this truly historical occurrence in Kant's text on the sublime. Rather, it is precisely there that he goes on to ask, quite abruptly in fact, whether and where this passage to the event becomes "apparent" in Kant's text at another moment, though without its being openly stated as such (A/79).9 This is the moment, moreover, when de Man's own text begins to make things happen. After inserting a break or blank into his reading here, de Man undertakes to show that Kant's text is indeed marked in an indelible manner by the pas- sage from trope to performance, in other words, by history as it has to emerge from the articulation of the section on the mathematical with the dynamic sublime. What follows is de Man's treatment of the General Remark that concludes the analytic of aesthetic judgment in the third Critique. In this ever so aptly named re-mark, An-merkung, de Man finds what he is looking for: the passage from trope to performa- tive effectuated by the epistemological critique of the sublime leaves its trace on the world when Kant goes on to consider how, within the sublime, the starry heavens that cover the earth's surface appear as the purely architectural construct of an all-encompassing vault (ein weites Gewölbe). More precisely, de Man adds, the world of natural space can at this point no longer be seen as nature but must henceforth be regarded as a function of art as techné, that is, as a building, in fact, a certain kind of house.10 But before rushing to take up abode there,</page><page sequence="13">1060 KEVIN NEWMARK we should examine with a bit more care the materials with which, always according to de Man, this particular house, temple or crypt is necessarily traced out and erected. For it is here that de Man focuses on Kant's reminder about how nature, in its sublimity - that is, its radically non-teleological aspect - is to be considered as pure architectonic construct. In the first place de Man notes how, at this moment of Rant's text, the capacity to find nature sublime is a distinctly poetic faculty. If we want to have access to the sublime by entering nature as into the architectonic of a covered house, then we will have to learn to do it the way the poets do, "wie die Dichter es tun."11 But how is the poetic to be understood here - and, especially, what role does it play in the key transition from pure to practical reason that remains the burden of Kant's entire investment in the aesthetic? Taking his cue from the way Kant links the sublime with the poetic faculty of constructing the heavens into a vast arch bounded at the horizon by the floor of the sea, de Man wonders if we should regard Kant as anticipating in this manner certain themes prevalent in romantic poetry as well as in the later Heidegger. Poetically we dwell upon the earth from the moment we inhabit natural space as though it were a house built to shelter Being. The problem with this reading, according to de Man, is that the sublime in Kant's passage is not structured like that kind of house, since it is not a dwelling, and it can therefore neither offer nor deprive us of shelter. Beyond shelter, otherwise than shelter, then, the construct that Kant's poet builds into the sublime experience of nature has little to do with the aesthetic reception of poetry as it has developed from Kant's text all the way to Heidegger. In fact, the only example that de Man can finally offer for the way "nature" appears to poets as a building in Kant's text is itself a rather strange poetic device, and it serves only to underscore the divergence of the non-teleological sublime from any symbolic and therefore aesthetic elements. In a lesser-known passage from Kant's Logic, de Man finds a metaphorical comparison to illustrate his point about the way poets erect nature into a bounded space, as opposed to the way all other human beings - Hölderlin, Wordsworth, Heidegger, presumably - conceive of such covered buildings for the purpose of both dwelling and shelter. "[A] wild man," de Man translates himself from Kant's text, "sees a house of which he does not know the use. He certainly observes the same object as does another, who knows it to be definitely built and arranged to serve as a dwelling for human beings [als eine für Menschen eingerichtete Wohnung] . Yet in formal terms this knowledge of the self-same object differs in both cases. For the</page><page sequence="14">MLN 1061 first it is mere intuition, for the other both intuition and concept." And then de Man supplies the conclusion: "The poet who sees the heavens as a vault is clearly like the savage, and unlike Wordsworth" (A/81).12 According to de Man, the poet, at least when he is acting poetically, as a poet does it, is not really a man, is not exactly human; he's not a real Mensch as we like to say, the same as everybody else. The poet, insofar as he constructs nature in a thoroughly non-teleological manner as a house that is manifestly not a dwelling or a shelter, is therefore a wild man, ein Wilder. Or, it would be better to say: the poet is a certain kind of wild man, since the poet is most definitely not simply or naturally wild in any sense of the word. What is wild, de Man will make clear, is the poet's prosaic capacity to find nature sublime, to consider the world in a thoroughly literal and therefore non-teleological manner, entirely devoid of both concept and perception, understanding and sensation, as well as all the tropological exchanges in which such pairs necessarily partake. For when Kant says that, in the sublime, the poet "sees" the sky as a vault, he cannot mean that in a figurai manner, since in that case the poet would already be substituting an intellectual content, a cogni- tion, for what is happening materially before his very eyes. Still less could we call what the poet "sees" in the sublime a mere perception, since in whatever form the starry skies appear to the naked eye, they in no way constitute an empirical vault, roof, arch, doorway, window or any other architectural element of an actual building. Neither as conceptual knowledge, then - for instance the heavens as a metaphori- cal house and shelter - nor as pure sensation - for instance the starry skies as nothing but starry skies - the only access the poet can have to the sublime passes therefore through what de Man has been calling the formal materiality of the letter, in this case, ein weites Gewölbe, the frame of a vault that freezes, burns, or better, etches the sky into an undeniable but utterly blank notation. It is in this way, in the articulated space of a signifier, that history à la lettre leaves its mark on the world. The passage from trope to performance, accomplished by way of the epistemological critique of the mathematical and dynamic sublime, issues first of all, as it must, in this "re-marking" of the world as pure frame. It consists therefore in the erection of an archival vault for the inscribed signifiers that have to result from any genuinely historical event. De Man himself states this with all possible precision in the lecture on Schiller, when he indicates what also always happens in the wake of such events: "... the transition from the trope to the performative . . . will always</page><page sequence="15">1062 KEVIN NEWMARK be reinscribed within a cognitive system, it will always be recuper- ated ... in a tropological system of cognition again .... [But] the regression from the event, from the materiality of the inscribed signifier in Kant, ... is no longer historical .... The event, the occurrence is resisted by reinscribing it in the cognition of tropes, and that is itself a tropological, cognitive, and not a historical move . . ." (AI 133, 134; emphasis added). Where is it, we must now ask, that the materiality of this archival vault that is erected in Kant's text is then reinscribed within a tropological system of recuperation that is no longer historical in de Man's sense? And what, if anything, is de Man's own text able to do in the face of this unavoidable regression and relapse? The architectonic of the letter, the techné by which alone the event is materially inscribed on the world, appears juxtaposed in Kant's text to a second architectonic, one in which de Man retraces the construction of a new tropological narrative of recovery and recuperation. But this narrative, which recounts the all-important sacrifice that imagination will have to make to align itself with the superior powers of tran- scendental reason, is not a simple repetition of the earlier version of tropological structures and their transformations played out in section 26. For this time, concerning the interaction between the faculties of imagination and reason, de Man is careful to note that the tropes have expanded well beyond their merely formal operations of syntagmatic succession and paradigmatic substitution, in other words, far beyond the quasi-totalizing synecdoches of the earlier section. What could remain only implicit in the first shift between the mathematical and the dynamic sublime, that is to say, in the blank that signals the actual occurrence of history, will now have to become legible in the General Remark as the juxtaposition of both the materiality of the letter and the emergence of overtly political and ideological discourse. Unlike the straightforwardly tropological relationship between apprehension and comprehension dealt with in sections 25-28, the relation between imagination and reason now manifests itself in the Remark as an actual conflict, or battle between unequal but mutu- ally dependent forces. Just as in the Nietzsche sentence from the first Messenger Lecture, de Man will identify the political dimension of Kant's text with the moment when tropes move beyond the confines of their closed circulation to name specific entities and agents, and that independently of any philosophical justification for their consti- tution as such. Tropes have a tendency to generate norms or values, in other words, systems of interpretation whose authority, like that of ideologies, is empirical through and through, since it can no longer</page><page sequence="16">MLN 1063 be restricted to purely formal structures of exchange and meaning. In the course of the Remark, the tropological transformations of metonymy and metaphor described in section 26 "are personified or anthropomorphized" into the properly named faculties of "Reason" and "Imagination," which then square off and challenge each other for supremacy. "Like the five squabbling faculties hilariously staged by Diderot in the Lettre sur les sourds et muets" de Man continues, "the relationship between [reason and imagination] is stated in delusively interpersonal terms" (AI 86-87) . In the third Critique, the "conflict of the faculties," whether we find it hilarious or not, is therefore no longer represented as a merely academic exercise. Its implications become thoroughly political from the moment it pits the empirical freedom asserted by one anthropomorphic figure against the unequal and transcendent claim to freedom of another anthropomorphic figure. The binding claim of reason as opposed to the free-play of imagination, and which is upheld by means of recourse to a greater law and greater power, cannot be understood independently of the political and ideological ramifications that are inscribed within it. "The aesthetic," de Man has already emphasized in the lecture on Kleist (RR 264), "is primarily a social and political model, ethically grounded in an assumedly Kantian notion of Freedom," and this is one of the passages in Kant in which such a notion needs to be criti- cally examined. Hence, at this point in de Man's reading, the sudden and otherwise inexplicable references to Antigone and Iphigenia, tragic figures whose sacrifice of free will remains forever inseparable from the legal, political, and interpersonal struggles to which their acts ceaselessly bear witness. Hegel, as de Man well knows, will say nothing essentially different when he discusses both Iphigenia and Antigone in his Aesthetics. Nor will Kierkegaard when he identifies Antigone as the key figure in the transition from the aesthetic to the ethical that is carried out in Either/Or. What will always have been in play in imagination's struggle to become adequate (angemessen) to reason, despite its irreducible difference (Unangemessenheit) from it, is not only the provisional agreement, or truce, that is negotiated by the third Critique between competing "states" of mind; it is as well the irreducible historical and political differences between actual states that are its necessary correlate. The crucial shift that de Man thus traces from the formal structures of tropes described in section 26 to the practical actions carried out by anthropomorphic figures in the General Remark, also demands to be accounted for in terms of Kant's own text. The justification is</page><page sequence="17">1064 KEVIN NEWMARK provided by Kant's insistence in section 29, immediately preceding the General Remark, that an aesthetic judgment about the sublime requires a predisposition to the feeling of practical ideas and not just concepts, in other words, the sublime must somehow be connected to a capacity for moral affect.13 Moral affectivity, in short, is what in an aesthetic judgment of the sublime would refer imagination to the practical sphere of law and politics, just as taste is what in an aes- thetic judgment of the beautiful refers it to the theoretical sphere of the understanding. We may find Kant's actual examples of affective judgment bland or silly, de Man remarks with a smile, but we need to develop a "taste" for them if we are to appreciate what is ultimately at stake in the sublime (AI 123). For according to the explicit logic of de Man's reading, the articulation of reason with practical action, the raison d'être of the third Critique, will pass by necessity through the affectivity of the sublime, whose appearance also happens to coincide with the problem of freedom as it unfolds in the conflict between imagination and reason. Now this conflict, as we have seen, is resolved, at least in appearance, through what de Man himself calls a "complicated and slightly devious scenario" of confrontation, nego- tiation, sacrifice, and exchange between opposing anthropomorphic powers. But this drama of personified faculties, which by its emphasis on the interplay of freedom, inequality, and submission already enacts the referential political sphere that it also serves to prefigure, is itself predicated on an even more fundamental transformation that has to take place at the level of affect, one which will ensure the link between a feeling for the sublime and moral feeling. In order for imagination to accomplish its appointed task, to ally itself eventually with reason by giving up its empirical freedom in exchange for the even greater freedom promised to it by the transcendental authority of reason, it must, according to de Man, recover from an initial shock. It should come as no surprise, mild or otherwise, that de Man would be particularly responsive to this shock, since it is of course the one that lies at the very root of the sublime.14 "Shock, which borders on ter- ror," Kant writes, "seizes the onlooker before the spectacle of towering mountains, gushing cataracts, and wastelands plunged into darkness" (195; 129). This description recalls Kant's earlier and perhaps better- known characterization of the "feeling" produced by an encounter with the sublime, which occurs "through a momentary interruption of the vital forces" ("das Gefühl einer augenblicklichen Hemmung der Leb- enskräfte") (165; 99) .15 But we now know from de Man's reading of the poet's "material vision" in what this shock, this suspension and thus</page><page sequence="18">MLN 1065 loss of every life force effectively consists. The affect of the sublime is shock because it has to register the failure of representation and along with it a sudden encounter with the formal materiality of language. It resides in that "moment" when every feeling is radically suspended, where there occurs an "experience" so devoid, so free of interest that it cannot be reappropriated under any organic category, be it of body or mind, or some combination of them both. The "blank" that de Man archives between the mathematical and dynamic sublime must therefore be understood, he will insist at the end of the lecture, as the architectonic space of this shock. Without the articulated blank, moreover, there would be no such thing as either cognition or per- formance, much less the passage from one to the other, that is to say, history as the space of the political and ideological. Into this vault, de Man will reinscribe the materiality of Kant's signifier. He does so by reading the shock of the signifier à la lettre, as that which alone juxtaposes side by side in Kant's text the poet's vision of the sublime with the allegorical attempt to understand and thus recuperate from it. The drama of the faculties has no choice but to tell the self-serving story of how imagination, and then reason, will ultimately be able to overcome the historical shock of the sublime by rearticulating it with the illusion of tranquil admiration, the necessary precursor to the respect (Achtung) that is always required by moral law. But such ideo- logical relapses, de Man warns, despite their inevitability, will always be marked by the original trauma, bordering on terror, to which they owe their own existence. Only the poet who is wild or the wild man who is poetic can read the singularity of this shock that is archived in Kant's third Critique: de Man locates it specifically in the inscribed signifier Ver-wunde-rung. Such would be de Man's material vision of history as wounding, a criti- cal art or techné that fractures - poetically, savagely - the political and ideological constructions of authority it then makes possible once again in the wake of its own writing. The burden of the political thus becomes the ever-recurring challenge of refashioning this wound of the signifier - die Wunde - into a process of philosophical questioning - das Wunder - that would one day become adequate to it, a Bewunderung of Verwunderung, then, and which is also the path followed in Kant's analysis of the sublime.16 Such a passage, or "modulation" as de Man calls it at one point, will always have to proceed from the shock and quasi-terror of the letter to a recovered tranquility of the mind in its freedom to think and to act in the world with reason (AI 84-86) . This, of course, leads to the most political moment of all in de Man's text,</page><page sequence="19">1066 KEVIN NEWMARK since it also corresponds directly to the question par excellence of the political. By extending slightly de Man's own formulation, "There is history from the moment that words such as 'power' and 'battle' and so on emerge on the scene," one could now say: history becomes political from the moment that words such as "freedom" and "justice" and so on emerge on the scene (AI 133). This moment occurs in the General Remark when it addresses the law by which freedom is necessarily apportioned or measured out - gemessen an - among the conflicting claims forever put upon it by anthropomorphic figures at once imaginary and reasonable. How can we then fail, no matter the price, to assent to the passage from history's blank shocks to the wonders of transcendental reason? De Man in no wise opposes the law of this passage, moreover; far from it, he emphasizes over and over its ineluctable hold on us. However, the passage occurs in his own writing in a critical mode that could no longer be called simply ideological, much less tropological, since it repeatedly submits itself to this law only in order to subvert the foundations of its authority. In the particular instance of reading Kant, this happens when de Man affixes his signature to the imperative of grasping the propor- tionality of imagination's relation to reason - their Angemessenheit, then - the taking of a common ratio without which no law or politics would ever be thinkable (AI 89-90). The paradoxical requirement of finding a standard for measurement, or Maßstab, which governs not only the analysis of the mathematical sublime but the possibility of aesthetic reflective judgment as such, already implies an analogous obligation in the practical sphere, and Kant himself does not fail at this point to offer the exemplary case "in concreto": the actual degree or magnitude of civil liberty and justice that is allotted by the state to its subjects ("die Größe der öffentlichen Freiheit und Gerechtigkeit in einem Lande') (section 25: 170; 104). Having duly noted how the notion of the sublime ultimately hinges on imagination's elevation from the pure shock of Verwunderung to a respectful Bewunderung before rea- son's sovereignty, de Man concludes his reading by wondering how a genuine incommensurability between such powers - the original Unangemessenheit of the still phenomenally determined imagination to the extra-sensory domain of reason - could ever be converted with- out remainder into their congruity, or Angemessenheit. The "bottom line" - which in de Man refers every bit as much to the political as to the economic and financial discourses from which it is in the first place borrowed - would also be the line that articulates the irreduc- ible distinction, and thus inequality, between all true differences and</page><page sequence="20">MLN 1067 the merely hypothetical adequacy or equation that can only ever be imagined to prevail among them.17 Without such a bottom line, de Man now adds, the constant alternation, or passage, between terms like adequacy and inadequacy would proceed to the point where one can no longer tell them apart. At precisely this point, where the crucial articulation of theoretical with practical reason is supposed to be ensured by the sublime and self-sacrificing labor of imagination, the ineradicable difference between terms like equality and inequality threatens to disappear without a trace. It is at this point as well that de Man will draw his own line between Verwunderung and Bewunderung, and by doing so disarticulate once and for all their presumed compatibility within the unifying principle of the sublime. De Man, who is often thought to have forgotten all about the reality principle in the name of literary fictions, is unsurpassed in his capacity to remember that the fiction of "comparative" or "proportion- ate" equality remains the most ideological of historical and political evasions. By supplying from his own language a quasi-equivalent for the radical incompatibility of Verwunderung and Bewunderung that is covered over in Kant's text by the figurai reconciliation of the facul- ties, de Man's writing stubbornly resists the seductive idea that the actual occurrence of shock and terror could ever be subsequently harmonized or made congruent with admiration and respect.18 At the point where one can no longer tell the terms Unangemessenheit and Angemessenheit apart, de Man's reading thus underlines, the actual economic and political inequalities to which such terms also always refer would be allowed to fade from view. Hence the eruption at this point of a new line that passes between and splits them apart in de Man's own writing. The passage that transforms imagination's inadequacy to reason into adequacy, the promotion from empirical inequality to transcen- dental equivalence that remains the aim of all that Verwundering and Bewundering in Kant's analysis of the sublime, how could de Man have possibly resisted translating it at one stroke with bewildering? "And are we not made to assent," de Man asks in conclusion, "to the more than paradoxical but truly aporetic incompatibility . . . because of a constant, and finally bewildering alternation of the two terms, Angemessen(heit) and Unangemessen(heit), to the point where one can no longer tell them apart?" (AI 89-90). The constant shuttling by which we are always made to swallow this passage between wholly unequal terms, de Man says, is not just bewildering; it is finally bewildering, bewildering at last and in its finality, bewildering definitively and without end much less</page><page sequence="21">1068 KEVIN NEWMARK ultimate purpose. In the materiality of bewildering, then, the ceaseless shudder of Verwunderung and Bewunderung is at last arrested, though manifestly not sublimated, sublated, erhoben or aufgehoben in any sense that could ever be conceived as adequate, or angemessen. Up to a point, it could even be said that bewildering is the most inappropriate or unangemessen signifier imaginable for the task assigned by reason to our obligatory passage from Verwunderung to Bewunderung But that is also because such a signifier, taken prosaically and therefore à la lettre, actually succeeds in re-opening the concealed wound that remains forever at the origin of Kant's thinking of the sublime. That wound, as we have seen, is the one that is suffered, for the sake of history, moreover, by the poet who is also a wild man. For only a poet, like de Man, can ever be wild enough to restore the wound to its proper place, in the endlessly inappropriate play of the signifier. No house or dwelling can be built to domesticate or recover the wildness of that wounding letter, whose errancy inhabits the architecture of all being - a be-wild-err-ing, then, that in Paul de Man's writing is finally and wildly historical as well as poetic and political.

Further references in the text. 4 Stefano Rosso makes a point of emphasizing how "de Man had agreed to try to be as 'perspicuous' as possible, since he had to be understood by listeners and not by professional readers . . ." (115). The degree to which the contractual agree- ment of the Interview depends here on the transparency of an "understanding" that would not be subject to the constraints of "professional" reading is already a symptom of the uneasy relation between critical epistemology and ideology. 5 To miss de Man's recurrent insistence on language as a necessary but problematic articulation between philosophy and history is to misconstrue nearly everything. A recent example of such a wide miss of de Man's point - by a mile as well as a millimeter - is provided by an article published in last year's issue of this journal by Leroy Searle. What is at stake in de Man's 1960 essay, "The Intentional Struc- ture of the Romantic Image," which now appears as the opening chapter in The Rhetoric of Romanticism, is not easily reducible to what Searle rather casually terms and then dismisses as "the dialectic of words and things." As its title already hints, and as is confirmed by reading the argument of the essay, what concerns de Man is the precise way that the faculty of the imagination has to intervene between the</page><page sequence="22">MLN 1069 perception of empirical nature and what he calls "the ascent of consciousness." In a vocabulary that he would no doubt no longer have used only a few years later, de Man identifies the crux of romanticism with "the passage from a certain type of nature, earthly and material, to another nature which could be called mental and celestial, although the 'Heaven' referred to is devoid of specific theological connotations" (RR 13; emphasis added). This passage from one "nature" to an- other, by which is actually meant the passage from nature to history (as opposed to theology), is effected thanks to the faculty of the imagination, and it manifests itself, de Man says, in the use of an "outspokenly sublime language" (RR 10; em- phasis added) . Thus, even in this early essay that makes no reference to Kant, de Man is already broaching the problem that in the third Critique, and in de Man's sustained reference to it throughout the Messenger Lectures, is posed by needing the imagination to bridge the abyss between nature and freedom, understanding and reason. See Leroy Searle, "From Inference to Insight: A Peircian Model of Literary Reasoning," MLN 123.5 (2008): 1006-38, especially part one. 6 Now entitled, "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant," in Aesthetic Ideology.

Pluhar (Indianapolis, Cambridge: Hackett, 1987), will appear in the text. 7 Now entitled, "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," in The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York: Columbia UP, 1984). Further references in the text. 8 For an elaboration of the way this aporia between the singularity of the event and the iterability of the trace it will as such have left on the world is legible in Paul de Man's writing, see inter alia Jacques Derrida's "Typewriter Ribbon: Limited Ink (2) ("within such limits")" in Material Events, ed. Tom Cohen, et al. (Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 2001), especially 329-36. 9 De Man's actual sentence, not atypically, is syntactically and grammatically loose enough to require explication: "Our question, then, becomes whether and where this . . . becomes apparent in the text, at a moment when the aporia of the sublime is no longer stated, as was the case in the mathematical sublime and in the ensuing general definitions of the concept, as an explicit paradox, but as the apparently tranquil, because entirely unreflected, juxtaposition of incompatibles . . ." (AI 79, emphasis added). The parallel construction, "the aporia of the sublime is no longer stated as ... an explicit paradox"/"but [rather stated] as the . . . juxtaposition," cannot be completed in a satisfactory way here, since a "juxtaposition," unlike a "paradox," cannot really become a "statement" in the strict sense of the term. This is nevertheless consistent with the fact that whatever material trace the passage to history leaves in a text, it could not become "apparent," or better legible, as either an explicit "statement" or a "conceptual definition." It appears then that the theoretical consistency of de Man's thinking, at least in this passage, can be preserved only at the cost of its own grammatical coherence. 10 The specification of nature, in the sublime, as both an art and techné of the "build- ing" is not, properly speaking, part of de Man's argument in the fourth Messenger Lecture, but comes instead from an earlier paper that he delivered at the MLA in 1981. The paper is entitled "Kant's Materialism" and can in many respects be considered another or preliminary version of "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant." For the specification in question, see "Kant's Materialism" (AI 125-27). 11 The key word in this formulation is the pronoun, es, it, for what exactly the poets "do" in constructing the experience of the sublime remains impossible to say since it is in fact the condition of possibility for saying anything. De Man offers his own highly compact version of this undecidability in his paper, "Kant's Materialism," when he traces out the architectonic of the sublime in the following "juxtaposition</page><page sequence="23">1070 KEVIN NEWMARK of incompatibles": ". . . What is [the erection of the architectonic] for Kant? We receive a hint in a passage which tells us how to look at the sublime, how to read judiciously, like the poets ('wie die Dichter es tun'): 'If we call sublime the sight of a star-studded sky . . .' ..." (AI 126; emphasis added). For an elaboration of what lies compacted in de Man's juxtaposition of "looking" and "reading" here, see (read) Andrzej Warminski, "'As the Poets Do It': On the Material Sublime," in Material Events, ed. Tom Cohen, et al. (Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 2001) 3-31. 12 There is of course an irony in the way that de Man distinguishes here between Kant's (wild) "poet" and the more familiar image of Wordsworth, one that perhaps only he would indulge in so good-naturedly. Just as nothing has happened in the reception of Kant - until "this" reading by de Man? - so too nothing would have happened in the reception of Wordsworth - at least nothing that would have made a dent in the overwhelmingly aesthetic reception of his poetry. And so this de Man, like everybody else - wie ein anderer - reads Wordsworth here as though another (ein ganz anderer und wilder) de Man had not already read him as Kant's poet in so many other essays! The passage in Kant can be found in the Logik, Werkausgabe, 6:457. 13 "Die Stimmung des Gemüts zum Gefühl des Erhabenen erfordert eine Empfäng- lichkeit desselben für Ideen .... was man mit dem gesunden Verstande zugleich jedermann ansinnen und von ihm fodern kann, nämlich in der Anlage zum Ge- fühl für (praktische) Ideen, d.i. zu dem moralischen . . ." (Kritik 189, 190; Critique 124, 125). See also section VII of the Introduction. On the role of affectivity in an aesthetic judgment of the beautiful, see Jacques Derrida, "Le Parergon," in La vérité en peinture (Paris: Flammarion, 1978). For an excellent account of what remains in play in the philosophical reception of Kant's sublime "feeling," which however does not mention either de Man or Derrida, see Peter Fenves, "Taking Stock of the Kantian Sublime," Eighteenth-Century Studies 28.1 (1994): 65-82. 14 The reference is to the famous Boy of Winander scene in Wordsworth's The Pre- lude (V. 406-09). It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that de Man's interest in romanticism as a crux for literary theory as well as for literary criticism and history stems from his attentiveness to the peculiar structure and occurrence of this "shock." For his most extended considerations of the textual occurrence of shock, interruption, and fragmentation, see TheRlietoric of Romanticism (New York: Columbia UP, 1984) and Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism, ed. E. S. Burt, et al. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1993). 15 And this characterization recalls a still earlier description, in section 14, of the affect of the sublime and the standard of measure (Maßstab) peculiar to its judgment: "Rührung, eine Empfindung wo Annehmlichkeit nur vermittelst augenblicklicher Hemmung und darauf erfolgender stärkerer Ergießung der Lebenskraft gewirkt wird, gehört gar nicht zur Schönheit. Erhabenheit (mit welcher das Gefühl der Rührung verbunden ist) aber erfordert einen andern Maßstab der Beurteilung, als der Geschmack sich zum Grunde legt . . ." (142; 72). Yet another passage, in section 27, compares the shock affect of the sublime to a shaking, shuddering or trembling motion: "Das Gemüt fühlt sich in der Vorstellung des Erhabenen in der Natur bewegt . . . Diese Bewegung kann (vornehmlich in ihrem Anfang) mit einer Erschütterung verglichen werden . . ." (181; 115). The German verb hemmen is a cognate of the English word hem. It means to restrain, to put a check on, or to interrupt by means of introducing a fold or a stitch; it is derived from plait work, wattle, thatch, i.e., sewing and weaving (Pflechtwerk) . As if by chance, the association within an experience of the sublime of "hemming" with a sudden shudder of shock also occurs at a key moment in Baudelaire's famous sonnet, "A Une Passante," much commented upon for the same reasons by Walter Benjamin:</page><page sequence="24">MLN 1071 ". . . Une femme passa, d'une main fastueuse / Soulevant, balançant le feston et Y ourlet; / Agile et noble, avec sa jambe de statue. / Moi, je buvais, crispé comme un extravagant . . . ." For a consideration of the way Kant's text on the sublime is organized by the intersecting lines of all these questions, see Jacques Derrida's "Le colossal," in La vérité en peinture (Paris: Flammarion, 1978). 16 Verwundern, to amaze or astonish, has no semantic tie to verwunden, to wound. The shock of the "Wunde" in Verwunderung therefore occurs and can only occur at the level of the inscribed signifier, which is also to say, like the erection of the "wide vault" under which the wild poet always stands, it can happen neither as cognition nor perception. The English word "wound," moreover, does not appear in de Man's reading of the third Critiquem this lecture. Rather, it becomes legible in the way he characterizes the "shock" of Verwunderung variously as "suffering," "pain," "mutilation," and "dismemberment" (AI 86, 88, 89). Nonetheless, all the wounding implications of Verwunderung in the Kant lecture are made literally manifest in the Kleist lecture, where the word "wound" is made to play a key role in de Man's treatment of the philosophical and historical category of the aesthetic as it developed in the wake of the third Critique (RR 275-80). 17 It would be pertinent to ask whether and to what extent an "equivalent" political moment can be documented in all the Messenger Lectures. The question could be developed by following the way Kant's analysis of the sublime necessarily relates measurement (Messung), freedom (Freiheit) and justice (Gerechtigkeit) directly to the question of equality. Sections 25-27, on the mathematical sublime, refer at key moments to the need for a standard of comparison and equality, ein Maßstab der Vergleichung, an obligation which by extension would also hold for the practical realm of law and politics. The possibility of establishing "Gleichheit" as equality, parity, and equivalence, is of obvious importance in the first lecture (the "correspon- dances" in Baudelaire) as well as in the last lecture (the individual "fragments" of a vessel that, according to Benjamin, without having to equal each other, "nicht so zu gleichen haben," nonetheless allow themselves to be articulated together, "sich zusammenfügen zu lassen"). In each case, it would be necessary to demonstrate the precise ways in which de Man's critical analysis of textual models leads to the disclosure of the historical and political systems that come into existence only as their correlate. The overtly political dimensions of the lectures on Kleist, Schiller, and Hegel are of course more clearly pronounced, though they too stand in need of being traced back to the rhetorical and epistemological configurations from which they also have to result. In this way would be disclosed what we might call the "law" of Paul de Man's own writing: a repeated response to the irreducible differences - linguistic, epistemological, economic, political, and ideological - that always lie concealed in the usurped, and therefore illusory authority of equivalence. "[T]he law," de Man writes in an economical summary, "is always a law of differentiation (Unterscheidung) , not the grounding of an authority but the unsettling of an authority that is shown to be illegitimate" (AI 115). 18 For if the affect of shock is truly prerequisite to "feel" the sublime in the first place, then what could ever prevent the sublime feeling of admiration from repeating this inaugural shock in its very attempt to recover from and move beyond it? Kant himself comes close to sketching out the mutually obliterating relationship that is involved here when he writes: "A sublime cast of mind can be called noble . . . only if it provokes not so much Verwunderung (an affect in which the representation of novelty exceeds all expectation) as Bewunderung (a Verwunderung that does not cease once the novelty has passed . . ." (199; 133; also see section 62, 311; 243). In other words, Bewunderung is itself nothing but (ceaseless) Verwunderung - the uninterrupted, though now dissimulated shock that necessarily accompanies the rational fiction of the mind's capacity to attain tranquil admiration, respect, nobility.</page></plain_text>
