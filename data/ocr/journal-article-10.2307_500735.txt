Wiesbaden (Franz Steiner Verlag), 1956. One hundred and sixty-nine of the ostraka cata- logued and discussed in this admirable publication are (or were before the last war) to be found in the great German collections of Egyptian antiquities in Berlin, Munich, Leipzig, and Hildesheim, with four others divided between the museums and universities of Hamburg, Tiibingen, Heidelberg, and Vienna, and one in the private collection of Dr. Kurt Herberts. Of the one hundred and seventy-seven drawings and colored sketches preserved on these flakes of limestone and fragments of pottery almost all are illustrated in line or (in thirteen cases) in color in the book's frontis-</page><page sequence="2">292 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AlA 61 piece and first forty-five plates, the remaining three plates being taken up with photographs of sculptors' studies, and the like, used as comparative material. Besides the museum number ("Berlin 214367") the catalogue entries give in each case the dimensions and material of the piece, the technique employed in pro- ducing its drawing or painting, its condition, prove- nance, and dating, the pertinent bibliography, and a selection of parallels. For the last Dr. Brunner-Traut has had recourse to more than four hundred sketches on flakes and potsherds preserved in museums and private collections the world over. Within the cata- logue the drawings are grouped in order according to their subject matter, starting with representations of anthropomorphic divinities and divine barques and continuing with drawings of royal and private persons, foreigners, divine animals, animals which figure in myths and stories, ordinary domestic and wild animals, plants, architectural elements and plans, inanimate ob- jects and lists, and, finally, hieroglyphs and practice sketches. The catalogue proper is preceded by a Foreword and a substantial and extremely valuable Introduction com- prising general discussions of the ownership and prove- nance of the ostraka, their materials and sizes, the techniques used, the subject matter, the purposes and originators of the different classes of drawings, the style and style development, and the dating. It is fol- lowed by a tabulated summary of the key items of information given in the catalogue and by six indices which add enormously to the usefulness of the book. In this fine series of drawings and paintings, most of which originated in the Theban necropolis during Ramesside times (Dyn. XIX-XX), the student of Egyptian art will find many old friends-famous draw- ings, some, unhappily, destroyed or lost during the heavy bombing of German cities in 1944. Such pieces are the satirical sketch of the lady mouse having her hair dressed by an attendant cat (Munich 1549), the kinky-haired Nubian and his oboe-playing ape (Mu- nich 1540), the goddess Astarte on horseback (Berlin 21826), the king at the Window of Royal Appearances (Berlin 3316 verso), the squatting figure of Amenhotep, Son of Hapu (Berlin 21447 verso), the naked peasant woman blowing up the fire in her baking oven (Leip- zig 1894), and the Queen of Punt sketched from the Deir el Bahri temple relief (Berlin 21442). Die altigyptischen Scherbenbilder is a book which will certainly take its place among the standard works on Egyptian drawing and painting. One of the most complete and richly documented treatments of its sub- ject yet produced, it can hardly fail to be a welcome addition to the library of the Egyptologist and art historian, and, one ventures to think, a source of con- siderable interest to the creative artist.
