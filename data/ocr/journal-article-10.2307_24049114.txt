In the Paris wine leg, the circular hole at the tip of the foot is very apparent, even though earth and dirt which have piled up inside, at the bottom of the vessel, now obstruct the out let. Quite small—it is only 18 cm high—the ves sel would easily have been held in the palm of the hand. A variant of the type emitting a jet-like stream of wine with an arched handle attached to the side of the vessel about two or three cm below the rim is represented by a number of pieces which turned up on the market in the last four decades. One of these could be seen in a London auction at Bonhams on April 7, 1998 (fig. 4).60 It is designed like a human leg up to the top of the calf. A short slanting rim curves out at the top, as it might in a vase. Here, yet again, a circular opening lodged at the tip of the foot allowed the wine to jut forth. It is identical to the outlet in the Paris wine leg, but instead of being placed in the middle of the footwear, it is where the toe would be.

The drinkers would have drunk in turns from the same vessel in stead of each of them holding his own wine leg. The symbolism of twin-legged vessels must certainly have been strong enough over a long period. Considerable diversity is displayed in their construction, and widely different styles are represented. A "vessel with two feet," as Trudy Kawami called it, is now in the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation in New York (fig. 7).63 Just as most of the vessels reproduce the profile of a flaring drinking beaker prolonging the shape of the foot, or in the case of the Hasanlu vessel in fig. 2 the two feet, so does the Arthur M. Sackler vessel represent a wine vessel shape walking on two legs. The lower part might vaguely suggest a human body handled in cartoon fashion. This too was designed so as to emit a jet-like stream of wine. At the tip of each foot, under the sole, a small circular opening drilled with care al lowed the wine to pour out.64 One might imag ine, as a working hypothesis, that the openings would be unplugged in turns to allow the liquid to come out. Another model is the ewer shaped like a squat pot with pouring spout on two human legs of which one example was excavated at Kaluraz and another variant is preserved in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.65 In both cases, the vessel rests on two shod feet with the tops Fig. 4.

On the largest vessel, this consists of two mouldings. The beaker is of a tall, slightly flar ing type. On the second object, the beaker has slightly convex sides. Broad vertical grooves are emphasized by sharp edges that melt into the sides two-thirds of the way up. Here, the sepa ration is discreetly suggested by a lighter streak in the earthenware. Without the evidence of the other two pieces, this division might be thought to be fortuitous. On the third and short est piece, the beaker also has convex sides. Its proportion can also be matched from earthen ware and bronze sheet vessels.67 The section and the foot are separated by a dotted line—the dots drilled in the same way as the figural motifs drilled in the central area of the beaker. Had the conditions prevailing in Äzarbäyjän allowed the use of modern techniques leading to more rigorous dating, the importance of the site in relationship to the study of wine legs would be greatly enhanced. As it is, the fact that the general context is known gives the proposed datings some foundation. The dates put forward by the Äzarbäyjän! scholars were retained by Guitty Azarpay when she described "two Urar tian boot-shaped vessels" from Karmir-Blur in Armenia.68 The last of the three wine legs ("terra-cotta boot vessel" in Miss Azarpay's words) is thus dated by her to "ca.

The top narrows slightly and is topped by a short neck of waisted cylindrical form joined with the top of the body by an arched handle. From the char acterization of the colour "dark brownish gray pottery with a highly polished and burnished surface," it appears to be similar to that of a wine leg in the collection of the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation (fig. 8).73 A third area has yielded a wine leg, alas dug up by commercial looters. It was published by P. R. S. Moorey, who observed that the black painted motif pointed to a place somewhere in "North West Iran," and dated it to the early first millennium b.c.74 The object is the only one of its kind that belongs to a public institution and has been illustrated. The shape of the leg, which is shod, is distinctly recognizable. A small han dle in the upper area clearly makes it a beaker. Out of the general imprecision, several facts emerge. One concerns the Marlilc wine leg. It came out of a richly furnished tomb in which the skeleton lay upon daggers, the hands reach ing out to or holding a gold beaker.75 This and the wealth of the jewellery associated with it led the excavator Ezzatollah Negahban to use the phrase "warrior king" in reference to the deceased.76 Should this observation come to be corroborated by similar finds, it would indicate that the constant association of the wine leg with royalty found in Persian literature of the Islamic period echoes a custom that goes right back to the dawn of Iranian culture. A second inference may be drawn from the very oddity of construction of some vessels. The Marlik wine leg is so unbalanced that the ves sel cannot stand on its own and needs to he supported.

It may be as sumed to date from the same period, the late 2d millennium b.c. or early 1st millennium, sub ject to future correction when proper excavation campaigns are at last conducted in the northern areas of Iran. While the symbolism was apparently suffi ciently compelling for some extremely unwieldy vessels to be constructed, more practical leg shaped beakers seem to have been common to a number of North Iranian areas. A small ves sel moulded from the pink earthenware typical of Marlik and other Grlan province wares may be very tentatively dated to the 9th or 8th cen tury b.c. (flg. II).80 Its shape and size would have made it a reasonably convenient wine tankard, easily held by the semi-circular han dle fitted into the upper side. Any attempt at working out a chronological classification seems futile when the limited material recovered from excavations yields so few safe anchoring points.

Notes A Note of Thanks: I wish to thank my colleagues in the museum world, particularly Trudy Kawami, Curator of the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation, New York, and Prudence Oliver Harper, Curator of the Ancient Near East Department, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, who, despite the constant calls on their time, went out of their way to help me with my study of the objects in their collections. In Teh ran, Mehdi Hojjat, the well-known architect and national heritage historian, and Musa Kargar, the distinguished director of the National Museum of Iran, gave me every facility to study the highly im portant pieces found in the course of archaeological reconnaissance now in the museum. 1.

The eminent scholarly editor and poet hesitated about the meaning of the compound pll-sä. In footnote 2, in the same page, he offers two possible interpretations: 1) "in the shadow of his throne so big that, if it is hoisted on to the back of an elephant [takht, "throne," is the word also used for howda], it "grates" it; or 2) it casts a shadow as big as an elephant; therefore no one can drain his wine elephant leg. I understand the distich differently. 1) I take takht to be used in its literal sense, "throne," rather than as howda, because praising the throne is expected in a dedication panegyric. 2) I under stand pll-sä, "pll-grating/scratching," to refer to the "floating elephant," in Persian pll-e häva 1, "the at mospheric elephant," a standard metaphor of a cloud, because the rule in this particular poetic conceit is that the same word must be repeated with a different meaning each time. As pll is used with the meaning "elephant" in the second position, it should not ap pear with that same meaning in pll-sä. Furthermore, I understand keshldan in its literal sense, "to drag," "to pull," not as Vahid Dastgerdi does, as a synonym of dai keshldan, "to drain [a wine cup/bowl/beaker]" be cause it is utterly unusual in the Persian system of images and metaphors to talk about animals (in this case, the elephant) drinking wine. It might be con ceivable in the context of an animal fable, hardly in that of Nezäml's panegyric where the humorous note would be out of tune. The symmetry of the images one would expect also requires keshldan to be used with the meaning "to drag": Just as the throne is so high that it scratches clouds (the floating elephants), the wine decanter (here the elephant leg) is so heavy (because it is huge) that elephants could not drag it. Comparison with Khäqäni's distichs quoted below in this essay shows that the punning contrast pll/pll-pä/ pll-e havä-1 was an established conceit at that time in Shirvän. 44. Sharaf-Näme, ed.

The paragraph on "Chronology and the Distribution of the Marlik Culture" pp. 95-96 and the table of "Comparative Chronology and Time Range of Some of [sic] Marlik Decorative Vessels" p. 94 yield no clear information. In his preface, Robert K. Dyson, Jr., who conducted excavations at Hasanlu, remains understandably circumspect. The only broad dating relevant to the wine leg appears in chap. 9, "Pottery Vessels," p. 243, as "late second and early first mille nium b.c." 72. See entry vol. 1, p. 219. 73. Kawami, Ancient Iranian Ceramics, col. pi. p. 152; relevant entry p. 153. The rusty brown surface veers to blackish grey. The surface has a fine burnish, yet shows traces of vertical scraping with a spatula. In ventory S-2071M. H. 34.1 cm. Max. W. 45 cm. Trudy Kawami kindly indicated (oral communication) that the narrow opening 0.65 cm across drilled in the sole gives access to a very narrow conduit right up to the top where it widens slightly in funnel shape. 74.

Ibid., p. 22, see vol. 1, pi. XI-A where the gold beaker, owned by the warrior king (?), arguably the most admirable of all the finds made at Marlik, can be seen in its crushed condition. The importance of the finds leaves little doubt as to the top-ranking position of the deceased—whether a king or a prince may never be known. 77. Müze-ye Melli-e Iran. Excavation number (?)

See latterly Harper and Meyers, Silver Vessels, pl. 22, text pp. 71-72. Mrs. Harper implicitly seems to consider that a date prior to the reign of Khosrow II (591-628) is unlikely, see p. 72. 87.

Clearly represented in full front in the earthen ware "Man with Goose" published by Eskenazi, Tang (London, 1987), no. 31, reproduced p. 63 and described p. 62. The goose is not held for "force feeding" as claimed in the caption. It is a wine ewer illustrating the Iranian concept of the wine duck. The top of the funnel coming out of its beak is carefully modelled like a wine boat. See present study p. 85 fig. 16. 94. Dlvän-e Salmän-e Sävejl, ed. Mansür Mo shaffaq (Tehran, 1336/1957), p. 626. The third hemi stich has az, not dar as in Ävastä's edition p. 548 (Kolliyät-e Khwäje Jamäl od-Dln Salmän-e Sävejl, ed. Ävastä [Tehran, n.d.]). I also corrected bar khwäste, reproduced in the printed editions, to bar khäste on the basis of meaning as well as image symmetry in the two hemistichs. 95. See Melikian-Chirvani, "Les taureaux ä vin"; Khäqäni, gäv-e slmln ("silver wine bull"), p. 105. Gäv-e zarrln ("gold bull," but possibly too "golden bull," in which case it may refer to silver gilt, brass, or pottery painted in golden [so-called "copper"] lustre), p. 107, in two different poems, and p. 109 Gäv-e sefä lln/sefäll ("pottery [wine] bull"), p. 109 in two differ ent poems. For English translations of some of these poems, see Melikian-Chirvani, "The Wine-Bull and the Magian Master," p. 116 (trans, p. 117) and p. 113 (trans, p. 114). 96. Melikian-Chirvani, "The Iranian Wine Horn from Pre-Achaemenid Antiquity to the Safavid Age," p. 88. In lexicography we hear about wine horns made from rhinoceros or bull horns, or elephant tusks. In another dictionary, wooden wine horns are mentioned. 97. On early Hittite wine ewers in the shape of var ious animals and birds recovered from Kültepe, see T. Özgtic, Ausgrabungen in Kültepe: Bericht über die im Auftrage der Türkischen Historischen Gesell schaft, 1948 durchgeführten Ausgrabungen, Türk Tarih Kurumu Yayinlari, ser. 5, no. 12 (Ankara, 1953). The best reproduction of these early vessels will be found in Schatten uit Turkije/Türkiye'nin: Tarihi Zenginlikleri/Treasures from Turkey (Leiden: Rijks museum van Oudheden, 1986), notably p. 88, no. 95, for a pair of painted wine legs from Kültepe. 98. For easily accessible reproductions of well known wine horns found on the territory that once was Urartu, see B. Piotrovsky, Ourartou (Geneva, 1969), pis. 47, 48, both from Karmir-Blour, outside present-day Yerevan. Captions p. 213, where they are dated to the 8th century b.c. But see latterly Simon Hämaiakian in Arminie: Tresors de VArmenie anci enne, p. 170, and p. 172, pi. 172, where Piotrovsky's pi. 47 is given a 7th century date. 91</page></plain_text>
