<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BREAKING OF THE BOW * By NAHUM M. WALDMAN, Dropsie University I. The bow as "military power" THE EXPRESSION "to break the weapon" or "to break the bow" in Akkadian signifies destroying the military power of an enemy, e.g., assum tukki nakrim sa nistemmu kakki nakrim sdtu lisb[i]r, "because of the outcry of the enemy which we are continually hearing, may the weapon of that enemy be broken";1 asar tamhdrim kakkasu lisbir, "in the place of battle, may (Zababa) break his weapon"; 2 dSamas kakkisu u kakki ummdnTsu lisbir, "may Shamash break his weapon and the weapon of his army";3 dIstar belet qabli u tdhdzi rd'imat sangutija ida'a tdzizma iqasassunu tasbir tdhdzdsunu raksi tapturma, "Ishtar, the lady of battle and war, who loves my priesthood, stood at my side, broke their bow, and scattered their battle-formations".4 The expression is also found in the curse formulae of treaties, e.g., aAstartu ina tdhdzi danni iqasatkunu lis( ?)bir( ?), "May Astarte break (?) your bow in a fierce battle"; 5 and dIstar bglet qabli tdhdzi ina tdhazi danni qasatkunu lisbir, "May Ishtar, lady of battle and war, smash your bow in a stiff battle".6 In the Aramaic Sefire inscriptions we find: [1xYina ] nw,7 n1 aK nNx ni 1p 1X &lt;nl Knm p m7nn 1t 1pXi n~n'i ntpi "as this bow and these arrows are broken, thus * Abbreviations used follow the CAD. 1ARM 3, 15:5-8. 2 Code of Hammurabi L (Rs.

Universal peace and the end of war The passages cited above refer to a specific adversary and a unitary incident. The breaking of any one nation's military power does not spell universal peace. There is, however, in Mesopotamian royal inscriptions the concept of the king as "cosmocrator", the ruler of the world, imposing his peace upon the nations and smashing war in toto. In connection with this, we should take note of the expression lugal kalamma/mada = sar mdtim, "king of the land", and lugal an.ubda limmu.ba - saar kibrdtim arba'im, "king of the four edges (of the universe)".8 Related also is the image of the king as the shepherd of his people, providing sustenance and security, e.g., sib nig.si.sa uku.dagal.la.na u.sal ne.in.nad.a, "(Warad-Sin), the shepherd of righteousness, who makes his widespread people to lie down in peace";9 and the inscription of Lugalzaggizzi: kur.kur gir.na e.ni. si.ga.a ud.e.ta ud.su.su gui.e.na.gar.ra.a ud.ba a.ab.ba. sig.ta.ta idigna buranun.bi a.ab.ba.igi.nim.ma.su gir.bi si.en.na.sa ud.e.ta ud.su.su den.lil.li gab.su.gar nu.mu. ni.tuk kur.kur ui.sal.la mu.da.n ad kalam.e a.huil.la mu.da.e, "when he had delivered the lands to his foot as conquests, from the rising sun to the setting sun, he had subdued them unto him; at that time, from the lower sea, the Tigris and Euphrates, unto the upper sea, he made his 7 KAI, I, #222 A:38-39; ANET3, 660. 8 W.

I would suggest that the Mishnah contains the original idiom, going back to the Bible and to pre-Biblical models, e.g., Akkadian qabldtim ubelli (see, above, note 12). The Mekhilta passage would then be a paraphrase. The idiom has been shown to be reflected in the LXX rendering of Exod. 15:3, "the Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name". The LXX has xupLos cuvTptpofv rtoXzlouq, "the Lord crushes wars".17 Conceivably, the expression "man of war", although occuring in Isa. 42:13, was considered too anthropomorphic by later generations. This may account for the Samaritan ':i1 ';n pour peace into the earth's very bowels, much amity into earth's very bosom," C. Gordon, Ugaritic Textbook (Rome, I965), Cnt,iii,II-I4, 52-54; Anchor Bible, Psalms ,I (New York, 1965), p. 28I. The Ugaritic pas- sage, however, does not have any relationship to the ruler-of-the- world and universal-shepherd theme. 15 There are other elements of the warrior-god theme in this dif- ficult psalm, e.g., v. 7, the fear-silence pattern, see the writer's study in JQR 64 (I976), I89-I92; v.

Midrash Mekhilta (Shirata, 4) interprets the verse as referring to one of God's manifestations: He appeared to his people as a warrior at the Sea of Reeds, and as an old man full of mercy at Sinai. The LXX appears also to be an early paraphrase, in order to avoid the anthropomorphic connotations of nnnzr t,K.19 In Mesopotamian sources, how- ever, gods are spoken of as warriors, providing the model for the Biblical expression, e.g., ur.sag.Sul, "mighty warrior" (Shamash),20 and qarradu, qurddu, "warrior".21 18 For an attempt to establish the correct text, or two variants of the original, see F.

The bow as a term for "vigor" There is reason to believe that the Biblical "bow" in the expressions we have considered was taken not literally but rather as a term for "strength, vigor". In Jer. 49:35 nrp and nm':nl nr"tt are parallel, while Targum Jonathan renders ntwp by lipn, "strength". An interesting parallel is the Pan- namua inscription, where we find in juxtaposition ;nnp 'v nn?z 5 1 nml: L IN "by his bow, or his might, or his word".22 The nonliteral understanding of "bow" in such contexts is clearly shown in Job 29:I9-20, where the metaphors are mixed: ru cnn mr.= :m',1 ~ D. " 1 t ' n 4' n , ^n'~ ?Lnn 'Tr1= 'nvp' "my roots are spread out to the waters, with the dew all night on my branches; my glory fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand". The image of the bow in the hand derives from the use of the actual bow, e.g., 2 Kings 9:24, nip: rr n~ nmi "and Jehu filled his hand with the bow" (so literally; RV and RSV have "drew his bow with his full strength"). Grasping an object is expressed by an idiom involving qdtu, "hand", and mali/n?, "fill", e.g., sirrassina ana qdtisu umalliu, "and placed their 'halter' in his hand".23 warrior," Code of Hammurabi, Epilogue, L (Rs.

The bow as a term for "sexual vigor" In an Assyrian passage we find the use of the word "bow" in the sense of "sexual vigor", or "manhood", e.g., isqasassunu ltki[m], "may (Ishtar, the goddess of men, the lady of women) take away their bow".24 The idea is that the warriors should be turned into women and rendered unable to fight. In an incantation for potency there occurs a'[i'rriq]a [is]rpaltu rai irm'a qastu, "may the quiver not become empty; may the bow not become slack".25 A Hittite parallel is translated in ANET (349b): "I shall give him a bow and arrows, and while doing so, I shall speak as follows: 'See, I have taken womanliness away from thee and given thee back manliness."' There are parallels in Rabbinic literature to this use of "bow", e.g., rnmln nrwp m;nnv 4 ~ndrn r "whosoever gazes upon the place of shame, his 'bow' becomes empty".26 Com- pare also Midrash Gen. R. 98:20 and B. Sot. 36b, where "his bow" in Gen. 49:24 is likewise applied to the membrun virile. 24 E. F.
