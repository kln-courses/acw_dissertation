John P. Capp and James A. Obermeyer Environmental Activities Staff General Motors Corp. Abstract Frontal crashes and near-side crashes were com- pared and found to be significantly different events. In a frontal crash, the energy to be dissipated from the occupant is constant for a given speed. In a side crash, the energy transferred to a struck-side occupant depends highly on his interaction with the door. That difference has important implications on the choice of countermeasures, injury criteria, and subsystem tests. In a frontal crash, chest and abdominal injuries occur in the "second" impact when the occupant, acting like a free-flight mass, strikes the interior. Padding can absoib some of the free-flight energy, reduce the impact force, and provide earlier and longer contact of the occupant with the interior. The earlier contact de- creases the differential velocity of the occupant to the interior, and the longer contact allows more time and greater distance to dissipate the kinetic energy. These improved energy management effects are reflected by lower deflection-based and acceleration-based chest injury criteria in a frontal crash test when padding is added. In a side impact, chest and abdominal injuries occur when the stationary occupant is "punched" by the encroaching door. Padding also provides an earlier and a longer contact of the occupant with the encroach- ing door, which prolongs the side impact punch. The prolonged punch can actually increase the net energy transferred from the door to the occupant, which may be reflected by higher deflection-based chest injury crite- ria. Despite the greater energy transfer, padding actual- ly reduces acceleration-based injury criteria, such as TTI(d), in the same side impact crash test. Traditional subsystem tests, such as sled or pendulum tests, can mimic most effects on an occupant of a frontal crash, but they cannot mimic many essential characteristics of a side crash. Introduction Extensive safety research and development has focused on enhancing occupant protection in frontal crashes for years, because frontal crashes are respon- sible for three-fourths of the total harm of all crashes (21). A large base of data and insight has developed to enhance occupant protection in frontal crashes. New emphasis is now emerging to enhance occupant protection in side crashes. Improving side impact crashworthiness would be simplified if the large knowl- edge base obtained from the years of frontal crash experience could be rotated 90° and applied to side impact. In fact, many conclusions regarding side impact have been obtained that way. Many of the demographic and environmental factors for frontal versus side impact were compared previously (29). This paper focuses on a scientific com- parison of the crash dynamics between frontal and side impacts. We will explain physical differences and similarities between front and side crashes utilizing data from full-scale tests, sled tests and other subsystem tests. We will then apply that knowledge to char- acterize the effects of common countermeasures and the utility of subsystem tests for frontal and side im- pacts, respectively. In field crashes, a car can be struck at any angle. Our discussion will be restricted to comparing the effects of a head-on frontal crash on a front seat occupant to the effects of an intersection side crash on a near side occupant. The two correspond to the FMVSS 208 frontal impact certification test and the new FMVSS 214 dynamic side impact certification test, respectively. Surrogates and Injury Criteria In both frontal and side impacts, the superiority of one design over another is often judged by the magnitude of the injury criteria measured on test dummies. In a frontal impact, the Hybrid III is the most advanced dummy available. Spinal acceleration and chest deflection measurements are the chest injury criteria. In a side impact, the appropriate dummy and injury criteria are subjects of continuing discussion. A federal standard is now finalized specifying the Side Impact Dummy (SID) (1), which measures lateral accelerations of the ribs, the spine, and the pelvis. SID was de- signed to achieve biofidelity in peak lateral accelera- tions in these areas during impacts similar to those experienced in the FMVSS 214 dynamic side impact test (11). The new standard includes a thoracic injury criterion called TTI(d), the average of peak rib and spine accelerations: TTI(d) = 0.5 (Rib Gtox + Lower Spinal GmJ 1899</page><page sequence="2">TTI(d) is actually the kernel portion of TTI, the Thoracic Trauma Index: TTI =1.4 age + 0.5 (Rib + Lower Spinal G„J * Body Mass/165 TTI was originally derived from cadaver test data, while TTI(d) is intended to be applied to measurements in test dummies. Other data suggest that torso compression, best embodied as the maximum chest deflection, or D^, along with the velocity of deformation, best embodied as the maximum Viscous response, or VC^ (19), are the mechanisms more closely related to chest and ab- dominal injuries (3 5 6 24 30). To address the need to measure chest and abdominal deflection time history in a side impact, an SAE committee designed a new side impact dummy, called BIOSID, to conform to biofidelity corridors of the International Standards Organization (2 11). BIOSID also measures rib and spine accelerations needed to calculate TTI(d), and it measures pelvis acceleration. SID does not measure chest or abdomen deflection and was not designed with biomechanically correct thorax deflection or stiffness (11). For our discussion, we have assumed that TTI(d) as measured by SID or BIOSID is an acceptable pre- dictor of the kernel portion of cadaver TTI and that BIOSID D^ is an acceptable predictor of cadaver thoracic injury. The NHTSA said that the biofidelity of the SID spine and rib acceleration responses are within the range of acceptable biofidelity and that the bio- fidelity of BIOSID for these responses is comparable (11). In separate series of sled tests reported by Cava- naugh, et al, and by Viano, BIOSID deflection-based criteria, among several SID and BIOSID chest injury cri- teria, appeared to best predict thorax and abdomen injuries in cadavers (5) and swine (28), respectively. Human cadavers and anesthetized animal models offer monitoring of injury criteria and independent injury assessment by an autopsy. They are, therefore, the model of choice for actual verification of contrasting injury criteria. The mechanism of blunt injury of the torso may depend on impact speed, but it does not depend on test method. If an injury criterion is related to the causal mechanism of injury, the same criterion will pre- dict injury in full-scale or sled tests, in pendulum or impactor tests, and with padded or unpadded impact- ing surfaces. If a design modification in a vehicle reduces an injury criterion in a crash test, the risk of injury should also be reduced with the new design in an actual crash. The Frontal Impact (Fig 1) A frontal crash is a two impact event: First: The vehicle strikes a barrier, causing the front end to crush. Kinetic energy of the vehicle is expended in deforming the ve- hicle's front structure. Second: The occupant continues to move forward as a free-flight mass and strikes the ve- hicle interior or loads the restraint. Some of the kinetic energy of the occupant is ex- pended in deforming the vehicle interior or the restraint system, and in deforming the First Impact Second Impact / y* snn %£''1 ' Fig 1 : The impact sequence in a frontal crash. The first impact is car to barrier; the second Is occupant to interior. The second impact is the injury producing event. occupant's torso. The remaining kinetic energy is dissipated as the occupant decel- erates with the vehicle. Iniurv Causation in a Frontal Impact Injury occurs while the occupant is loading the interior or the restraint system, commonly referred to as the second impact. The kinetic energy of the occupant's torso should be dissipated gradually for the impact to be non-injurious. If there is a large differential velocity between the occupant and the interior, then much of the kinetic energy must be dissipated during the impact of the occupant with the interior or the restraint system. If this second impact is of a very short duration, then the resulting forces on the occupant can exceed human tolerance levels. The kinetic energy dissipated during the second impact is a function of the occupant's mass and of the differential velocity of the occupant to the interior. Managing the Energy in a Frontal Impact Energy absorbing (EA) materials on the interior, and devices such as EA steering column, belts and air bag, provide two important synergistic benefits. First, they enhance "ride-down" for the impacting occupant. Second, they absorb some of the energy of the second impact. "Ride-down" can be described as taking advantage of the gradual deceleration of the center of gravity (CG) of the vehicle to manage the occupant's energy. At the onset of a frontal crash, the free-flight occupant and the decelerating vehicle interior have the same initial veloci- ty. The car interior slows relatively gradually as the 1900</page><page sequence="3">front structure of the vehicle crushes. The occupant travels at his initial speed until he contacts the interior. Since EA materials always take up space, they induce an earlier coupling of the occupant with the gradually decelerating interior. The forces required to decelerate the occupant during ride-down are often below human tolerance levels. The earlier contact also results in a smaller differential velocity between the occupant and the interior. The earlier contact thus reduces the portion of the occupant's kinetic energy that must be dissipated in the second impact. EA materials can be designed to crush at forces below human tolerance levels, and they absorb energy as they are crushed. Because of this crush, the occupant's differential velocity with the interior in the second impact is reduced over a longer period of time. This towers the deceleration forces on the occupant. A Spring-Mass Analog (Fig 2) A simple analysis using a spring-mass analog to represent the human or the test dummy demonstrates how energy-absorbing materials, such as padding, reduce both deflection- based and acceleration-based injury criteria. The oc- cupant in free flight strikes a wall at velocity (v), which can represent the differential velocity between the oc- cupant and the interior. As long as padding crushes and removes some energy from the system, chest deflection (x') in the padded case will be less than that (x) in the baseline case. The padded acceleration (a') must also be tower than the baseline acceleration (a) because the chest and the padding behave like two springs in series, providing a greater distance for the chest to decelerate. This simplistic model is useful to help explain how padding can help reduce both chest deflection and acceleration in a frontal crash, but it does not stand atone as a proof. The spring-mass analog overlooks rate sensitivity of the torso and padding, and it only deals with average accelerations and maximum chest deflections. Analysis and testing can help determine the effects of padding in a specific frontal crash scenario. A Point Mass Analog (Fig 3) Another simple model can help explain some of the effects of padding in a frontal crash. The occupant is represented by a point mass subjected to a 30 mph crash pulse. In the baseline case, the initial spacing between the occupant and the interior of the car is 10 inches. In our example, the vehicle decelerates as shown, while the point mass continues at 30 mph until it contacts the interior at point c (at about 61 ms) after travelling 10 inches relative to the interior (represented by the marked area between the vehicle and point mass velocity traces). At that instant, the differential velocity (Av) between the point mass and the interior is about 18 mph. In the example, the interior has enough compliance to limit the deceleration of the point mass to 100 g (illustrated by the slope of line c-d). At point d (at about 71 ms), the ļļ ļļ^"* Baseline Padded 1/2 mv2= 1/2 kx2 1/2 mi/ - Ep= 1/2 kx'2 (x = chest deflection) (x' s chest deflection) x =ļmv2 X' =ļrW - 2Er N k n| k 4f° lx&gt;x'l A v2= 2xa fi- v = 2(x' + Xp)a' a = ^y2 a' = - v2 2x 2(x' +x„) (x &lt; x'+xp) [¡77] Fig 2: The spring-mass analog of a frontal impact. The analog can help explain how padding helps reduce both chest deflection and acceleration in a frontal impact. 1901</page><page sequence="4">point mass has reached the same velocity as the interior, and will "ride-down" with the relatively mild vehicle pulse to a stop. The total time to decelerate the point mass from 30 mph to rest was about 39 ms; however, the point mass experienced 100 g for 10 ms. In the second example, 5 inches of padding is added. Because padding occupies some of the space between the point mass and the interior, the point mass contacts the interior sooner (point c', at about 43 ms). Therefore, the point mass strikes the padded interior at a lower Av (about 13 mph) than in the baseline case. As padding crushes, it also allows the point mass more time and distance to decelerate, at 60 g in our example (represented by the slope of line c'-d'), to vehicle speed (point d', at about 56 ms). In the padded case, the total time to decelerate the point mass from 30 mph to rest was about 57 ms, all of which was at 60 g or less. Although this simple example can help explain some of the benefits of padding in a frontal crash, it does not stand alone as a proof or model. For ex- ample, a point mass cannot deform like an occupant. However, the analog illustrates how padding can reduce the differential contact velocity of the occupant to the interior, thus reducing the kinetic energy that must be dissipated in the second collision. It also demonstrates how padding provides more time and greater distance for the free flight occupant to dissipate that energy. Again, analysis and testing can help determine the benefits of padding in a specific frontal crash scenario. The Side Impact (Fig 4) A side crash is more appropriately characterized by a single event in which the moving barrier or vehicle strikes the side of the car. The struck door encroaches into the occupant compartment and strikes the station- ary occupant directly. The barrier strikes the door with so much momentum that the door behaves like a mechanical power source, or a "punch", to the dummy. This punch can be characterized by the velocity-time history of the door, which is affected marginally by the presence of the dummy (Fig 5).

Thereafter, barrier momentum is transferred to the CG of the struck car away from the door, and the door decelerates to the car CG velocity.

The car without dummies actually has a slightly lower peak velocity, possibly due to the slight difference In effective mass of the test vehicles. Injury Causation in a Side Impact The potential for injury in a side impact is principally related to the inter- action between the struck door and the occupant. The velocity-time history of the door, the occupant's location relative to the door, and the shape and compliance of the interior all affect the injury risk. Managing the Energy in a Side Impact Because of the characteristic shape of the door velocity pulse in a typical side impact crash test, the dummy's location relative to the door helps determine the velocity of the door when it strikes the occupant. Delaying the dummy's contact with the encroaching door can de- crease the energy transferred from the punch to the 8 1 1 1 1 CO II I o ►- ^ ^ / V^^-BASELIIIE 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 LATERAL DISPLACEMENT (MM) Fig 6: Hysteresis loops reconstructed from the chest deflection-time histories of BIOSID In the MVMA fufl-scale baseline and padded tests. The shaded area represents the additional energy dissipated In the BIOSID chest. 1903 occupant. For a given door velocity-time history, more energy is available for transfer from the door to the occupant if contact begins during the rise of the punch, and less energy is available for transfer to the oc- cupant if contact begins while the door is already decelerating. Padding and structure have been identified as potential countermeasures for side impacts (11). Modifying the vehicle structure can help reduce the peak velocity of the encroaching door by providing a more efficient and earlier transfer of momentum away from the door to the CG of the struck car. Energy absorbing materials, such as padding, do not alone change the velocity-time history of the door and might not reduce the severity of the side impact punch. Padding occupies space, and thus causes an earlier and a longer occupant contact with the door. Although the padding can also absorb a portion of the additional energy that is available due to the prolonged contact, the net effect in an actual side impact test can be a greater amount of energy transferred to the occu- pant. An apparent increase of energy transfer to the oc- cupant was observed in actual crash tests sponsored by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association (MVMA) (4) using 6 baseline and 6 padded Pontiac 6000s. Chest deflection was higher in the padded cars. This additional deflection resulted in an apparent increase in energy dissipated in the dummy chest, as represented by the area of the hysteresis loop on the force-deflection plane of the dummy impact response characteristics (Fig 6). This hysteresis loop was reconstructed by subjecting BIOSID dummies to pen- dulum impacts into the thoracic ribs. Pendulum force, chest deflection, and rib velocity were measured. The speed of the pendulum was varied until the maximum chest deflection and the rib velocity-time histories were similar to those in the baseline and padded full-scale tests. The force deflection plots shown were recorded in the pendulum impacts that matched the baseline and padded vehicle tests. The higher chest deflections, then, may reflect an increase in energy transfer caused by padding.

That same prolonged punch increased chest deflections. 1904</page><page sequence="7">one study has demonstrated BIOSID chest deflection to be a reasonable predictor of human chest injury (5). Despite the increased chest deflection and apparent increase in energy transfer, the padding sig- nificantly reduced TTI(d) (Fig 7), primarily by prolonging the contact to substantially reduce peak rib acceler- ations (Fig 8). The ARCEL padding used in the MVMA tests reduced TTI(d) to a level needed to comply with FMVSS 214 with a comfortable margin while increasing chest deflection. The MVMA tests also showed that padding advanced dummy contact by 10 ms and pro- longed the punch by 15 ms. Padding did not sig- nificantly influence peak spinal acceleration nor the characteristic shape of the spinal acceleration time history (Fig 10). A range of energy absorbing pads studied by Deng using a Cal-3D model (8) predicted a similar conflicting trend of increased chest deflection and decreased TTI(d) when padding was added as a countermeasure to a side impact pulse. In his model, the conflicting trend prevailed over the range of padding thicknesses and stiffnesses he examined. For example, as the padding thickness was increased, TTI(d) decreased and chest deflection increased (Fig 9). Warner et al also demonstrated the conflicting effect of padding on deflection and acceleration through graphical analysis of door and occupant velocity-time histories (31). In their analysis, a hypothetical padding designed to reduce spinal acceleration by 50% in- creased chest deflection well into the injury range suggested by swine and cadaver testing.

A Spring-Mass Analog (Fig 101 A simple analysis may help explain how padding could have decreased rib acceleration and TTI(d) while increasing chest deflection in the MVMA full-scale tests. The door velocity-time history is represented by a programmed punch. The punch is a power source, i.e., its velocity-time history is not affected by loads along its path. In the baseline case, chest deflection is equal to the effective stroke of the punch (D-d) less the amount the occupant moves O/2 a, At2). Since the padding occupies some residual space, p, the effective stroke of the punch is now (D-d+p). Unless the occupant moves further out of the way (1/2a,'Ať2-1/2atAť) to compensate for the residual thickness of the padding, maximum chest deflection will increase. In the MVMA crash tests (4), the time history of spinal acceleration was not significantly affected by padding in a side impact (a, = a,'). Although further analysis is needed to fully explain this, it may have occurred because the added force on the dummy due to the increased chest deflection (from Fig 6) from the baseline case (kx-4.5 kN) to the padded case (kx'=6 kN) is small compared to the total of forces acting to accelerate the dummy, including other toad paths such as the pelvis, the shoulder, and the viscous elements of the ribs. For example, to achieve 50 g acceleration of the whole dummy, a force of about 37 •kN is needed. The physical interpretation is that the body is soft and heavy. Forces on the thorax in the padded case could not move the whole body quickly enough to compensate for the padding thickness, in the MVMA tests, then, chest deflection increased with added padding. In the spring-mass model, the average rib ac- celeration (ą) is related to the square of the velocity of rib divided by the distance the rib is displaced (a, = sřlZx). In the baseline case, the velocity of the rib (v) is equal to the velocity of the encroaching punch. Since padding crushes, the velocity of the rib in the padded case (V) will be less than that of the punch. As explained above, deflection in the padded case (x') is actually greater than the baseline case (x). Thus, rib acceleration (a,' = v'2/2x') decreases with padding. The decrease in rib acceleration is reflected as a tower TTI(d). This simplistic model has limitations and does not prove that padding will always increase deflection while decreasing TTI(d) in full-scale side impact tests. The model only deals with average rib acceleration and maximum chest deflection. Nonetheless, the model may help explain the trends that did occur in the MVMA tests, and that could occur in other full-scale tests. The Point Mass Analog (Fig 11) A point mass analog may be useful to help illustrate examples of how padding that reduces acceleration may increase the total amount of energy transferred to the struck mass. In the baseline case, the point mass is initially spaced 9 in. from the struck door. The struck door crushes to fill the 9 in. (illustrated by the cross-hatched area), and contacts the point mass at point c. The door has finite compliance and it crushes as the point mass ac- celerates, at 100 g in our example (illustrated by the slope of line c-d). The point mass quickly acquires the door velocity of 15.4 mph and moves away at that velocity as the door decelerates. In the padded example, the addition of a 5 in. pad leaves only 4 in. of space, which is quickly filled by the crushing door (illustrated by the first cross-hatched area), which advances the contact of the occupant to point c'. The door has a higher velocity at the time of contact than in the baseline case and is accelerating instead of decelerating. In our example, the pad is designed to limit acceleration of the point mass to 60 g (illustrated by the slope of line c'-d'). This results in the point mass acquiring the door velocity of 18.5 mph at point d, higher than in the baseline case. Further, if the pad "bottoms out" after 3 in. of crush (illustrated by the second shaded area), for example, the point mass will then accelerate at 100 g (illustrated by the slope of line b'-d") based on the stiff er crush of the baseline 1905</page><page sequence="8">«ļ ta /' CB001 /-v CS003 5 ū /-X /' 50 /_ /-v , / ' baseline /' ^ho Z ' /' PADDED_ ^ho 2 I X 9¡ / ' w » i j 1 j L H 20 i i L. 20 / i / a(t) ' X io / 1 a'(t) ' io -1 jl X io 1 ¡L f iiCiiT y ' T. vluhJ ; ' Lin ' ^ LEFT ' -1oli"IIHIII 1 1 1 I I -lolllllllllll Jl 1 1 ■ ^ 1 - 0 20 -&lt;40 60 80 I OU o 20 «O 60 80 ion t(ms) t(ms) D = stroke of punch d = distance from punch to thorax X = maximum thorax deflection a,= spine acceleration af= rib acceleration p = residual thickness of pad S ' ' - S S V =dß S ' ' - S =® S r V tot, t2 ļ totit2r r i Baseline Padded X = (D - d) - 1/2 a,At2 X' = (D ■ d) + p ■ 1/2 a&gt;ť from tests, 1/2 a^ť- 1/2 ą|At'2 X &lt; x' v2= 2arx v,2= 2a'rx' a r=vL a'r - v'2 2x 2x' If pad crushes at all, then v &gt; v' ar&gt; al Fig 10: The spring-mass analog of a side impact.

Again, the simplistic model has limitations and does not prove that padding will always increase the energy transferred to the struck dummy in a side impact crash test. For example, the point mass analog of the occupant does not deflect like a human or a dummy. Also, only two padding scenarios and one velocity-time profile were analyzed. Nonetheless, the analog may help explain how padding potentially can induce a net increase in the energy acquired by the dummy in a side impact, which does not seem readily possible in a frontal impact. Again, more detailed analysis and testing can help determine the effects of padding on dummies or occupants in specific side impact scenarios. Can Padding Reduce Energy Transfer and Chest Deflection in a Side Impact? The two simplistic ana- logs can also help explain possible conditions for padding to reduce chest deflection and energy transfer in a side impact punch environment. Based on the spring-mass analog, there would be a net reduction of chest deflection if the padding could PADDED 9" SOFT PAD 30 I 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 26.8 mph 20 JÉIÉPsî v(mph) irrrr t wt wk w- ¿ 10 #É§ t wt wk w- Tält Door Velocity J/ýť Oce.

Physically, this padding must be softer than the human torso. The padding crush force thus moves the whole body more than deforms it. The padding must also be thick enough to allow sufficient time for the crush force to accelerate the spine, or the whole body, to more than compensate for the earlier occupant contact induced by the padding. We know of no published studies to date where these conditions have been met to reduce chest deflection in side impact crash tests by adding padding alone. The point mass analog can illustrate a hypothetical soft padding that crushes almost completely to limit the velocity acquired by point mass (Fig 12). In this example, 9 in. of padding fills all of the space in the baseline case (Fig 11) and crushes more than 7 in., while limiting acceleration of the point mass to 15 g. This would result in the point mass acquiring the door velocity at its 13.4 mph minimum. This example indicates reduced energy transfer compared to the baseline case. Further study would be needed to determine how such a thick, soft pad would perform in a wide spectrum of real-world side impacts, and whether customers would be comfortable driving such thickly padded cars. In a study described by the NHTSA (11), drivers rated 4 in. of added padding as "uncomfortable." Another scenario exists. The occupant must be moved far enough from the door to avoid the punch of the door. In this scenario, the occupant does not contact the door or any added padding until after the door and the CG of the struck car are at the same velocity. Padding may then reduce chest deflection and acceleration because the occupant-to-door contact would now be a "second impact". Such a scheme would likely result in a substantially reconfigured vehicle. The scenario may apply to a far side occupant in current cars. Also, if the side impact punch can be reduced or eliminated by extreme structural modifications, adding 1907</page><page sequence="10">padding could reduce TTI(d) and deflection. Hobbs reported reductions in TTI(d) from 178 g to 58 g and in chest deflection from 51 mm to 26 mm in the European Side Impact Dummy (EUROSID), by welding an exter- nal steel plate on the side of the car and adding pad- ding (12). Such extreme modifications may not be practicable, but demonstrate directional effects. Others have informally suggested avoiding the conflicting effects of padding on TTI(d) and chest deflec- tion by simultaneously moving the occupant away from the door by the thickness of the padding whenever padding is used. Such a scheme would preserve the baseline timing of dummy contact, and, therefore, the punch of the door into the dummy might not be pro- longed. However, if the occupant could be moved away from the door, not adding any padding would further delay and shorten the dummy's contact with the side impact punch, which may reduce the energy trans- ferred to the occupant compared to the padded case. Padding placed under door trim may also advance contact with the door because the padding takes up space that serves to help delay the punch in the baseline, unpadded case. To date, we know of no test data that demonstrate the feasibility of these two suggestions in reducing both TTI(d) and deflection. 30 $ v i X ļ'S~ Side Impact - Door Velocity / Nl /^Frontal Impact - CG Velocity v (mph) / ' 15 / 0 J f 1 i 1 f-* 0 50 100 Time (msec) Fig 13: A simplistic representation of the velocity-time history that best characterizes the critical elements in a typical frontal FMVSS 208 certification test and a typical side FMVSS 214 certification test. In the frontal crash, the velocity of the center of gravity of the tested car best characterizes the event. In the side impact, the velocity of the struck door best characterizes the event. Additional Observations of a Frontal Crash vs. a Side Crash (Fig 13) In the FMVSS 208 certification test, the occupant always experiences a Av the same as that of the test vehicle. In the FMVSS 214 certification test, the occupant can experience a Av as high as the striking barrier velocity to one as low as the Av of the struck vehicle. In both cases, we have neglected rebound of the dummy. In the frontal crash, the dummy receives the maximum ride-down with relative- ly low deceleration when there is no initial space be- tween the occupant and the restraint or interior. In the side crash, the dummy is coupled to a relatively severe door velocity-time history and may experience an increase in energy transfer when there is no initial space between the occupant and the door. Topography of the Impacting Surface in Frontal and Side Impact Injury causation in both frontal and side impact de- pends also on the shape of the impacting surface. In a frontal impact, the body in free flight is decelerated by the forces generated as the body strikes the interior or loads the restraint. Obviously, the same force is more injurious in a local area than over a large area, and some areas corresponding to vital organs are more vul- nerable than others. A tolerable force over an area of the steering wheel plane could be injurious if it were concentrated on the hub or the rim alone (14). The GM self-aligning wheel, for example, improves occupant protection by ensuring a more even distribution of load in all impact directions. It is soft enough to help prevent abdominal injury by tipping at the hub and strong enough to distribute chest and shoulder loading over the wheel plane (13 18). In a side impact, the stationary occupant is punched by the encroaching door. The forces gen- erated by that interaction deform the body and even- tually accelerate it away from the door. The same force is more injurious in a local area than over a large area. Some anatomic regions are more vulnerable than others. In a side impact, a stiff arm rest or other protrusions on the trim can produce concentrated loads. Door buckling induced by barrier impact can also present a non-uniform surface to the occupant. The effect of the impacting surface topography on injury is also well documented (25). In general, peak acceleration and deflection will be higher at the location of the concentrated load in a frontal or a side impact. The capability of a dummy to sense concentrated load depends more on the number of independent load measurement paths than on the injury criterion. For example, if the concentrated load were focused at a location where the dummy has no transducer, the dummy cannot sense it. The standard Hybrid III lacks an abdominal transducer, but the new frangible abdomen can be installed in a Hybrid III to assess abdominal loads (26). The SID is not equipped with shoulder and abdominal load paths to distinguish concentrated loads from distributed loads on the torso. The BIOSID has eight independent load measurement paths to represent the human torso, including transdu- cers in the abdominal region. Full-scale and Subsystem Tests Full-scale testing is the most comprehensive laboratory simulation of a specific field scenario for frontal and side impact. In frontal FMVSS 208 full- scale tests with the Hybrid III, a given design change generally affects chest deflection and spinal acceler- ation in a similar direction. In the new FMVSS 214 side impact test with the SID, TTI(d) and its component spine and rib accelerations are the only chest injury criterion that can be measured. Thus, possible con- flicting trends between chest deflection and accelera- tion cannot be documented, and may be overlooked. 1908</page><page sequence="11">Because full-scale tests are expensive, and new models are available only late in the development process, subsystem tests are often used to predict full- scale trends. The differences between energy manage- ment and transfer in a frontal crash and a side crash must be considered when subsystem experiments are conducted. As explained below, the punch of a side impact, for example, cannot be simulated in a traditional HEIDELBERG FULL-SCALE CAR TESTS CADAVER AIS VS.

Since the effect of topography of the impact- ing surface on injury outcome is similar in frontal or side impact, the same experimental technique can be used to study that aspect of frontal or side impact, as long as sufficient independent load measurement paths are available. Full-scale Side Impact Tests NHTSA used full-scale tests performed at the University of Heidelberg (22) to support the relationship between TTI and injury risk in a car-like environment. Those tests used human cadav- ers seated in identical Opel Kadette bodies-in-white. Since they were full-scale tests, we assume that the side impact punch was present. The velocity of the impacting barrier was the only variable in those tests. In such a test series, we would expect that cadaver injury and all other indices reflecting crash severity would tend to rise and fall together. While there is some correlation of TTI with injury in those tests, the demarcation of injury by TTI was marginal (Fig 14). These experiments only verified that acceleration and injury both increased with the speed of the crash when everything else was unchanged. They do not show whether or not TTI and injury severity are related when comparing different vehicle designs at a single crash speed. ^ A Hyge Sled Vmax ' « o ' V ( K. oL ^ ,Vmax I ' / I ~| ļ. - 1'^ Decel.

The vehicle interior is attached to a fixture which is ac- celerated from rest on the Hyge sled, or decelerated from crash velocity on the deceleration sled. When the dummy and vehicle interior collide on the deceleration sled, the dummy torso is in free flight striking a station- ary or decelerating interior. On the Hyge sled, the fixture is in free flight or accelerating as it strikes the stationary dummy. In either case, the sled simulates the typical "second" impact of a frontal crash. Sled tests have been an essential tool for simulating frontal impacts, and have aided in the development of frontal crash protective devices such as energy-absorbing steering systems, belt restraint systems, and air bags. Simulating the door velocity profile of a full-scale side impact test would require both acceleration and deceleration of up to 100 g during the 30 ms occupant contact. A typical Hyge sled only accelerates, while a typical deceleration sled only decelerates; neither can mimic the punch of a side impact. Despite this draw- back, many have taken advantage of the simplicity of the sled test, and rotated existing frontal fixtures by 90° to study side impact. Such research can still be useful for studying the effects of changing door topography, location of load paths, and comparing the responses of surrogates. However, the traditional sled test is not valid for evaluating the effects of padding with regard to the influence of spacing in a side impact. Sled tests repro- duce only the effect of padding on limiting impact force; they do not reproduce the effect of padding on the onset and duration of the side impact punch. Thus, sled tests would not reveal any opposing trends be- tween TTI(d) and chest deflection such as was ob- served in the MVMA full-scale tests when padding was employed. A large set of cadaver data was acquired on the deceleration sled at the University of Heidelberg (9). Data from those rigid and padded flat-wall impacts formed much of the basis of NHTSA's development of TTI as an injury criterion.

While these tests have produced an important body of data, retro- spection reveals the limits of their application. Since the deceleration sled did not reproduce the side impact punch, only the effects of padding on limiting impact forces and absorbing energy could be evaluated, not the effects of padding on prolonging occupant contact in a side impact crash environment. Because the tests were performed with flat plates, the effect of the topography of the impacting surface also could not be addressed. The Heidelberg sled series showed marginal correlation of TTI with observed injuries (Fig 16). Biological age of the cadavers contributed 40% to the average TTI score in its original formula. Without this age factor, which cannot be reproduced in current test dummies, less correlation would exist between TTI and injuries. A similar series of sled tests were sponsored by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and performed by Wayne State University (WSU). The CDC tests are the only padded and unpadded sled tests where both chest SCALED INJURY CRITERIA - SID &amp; BIOSID NHTSA 20 mph SLED TESTS 11.6- pi -X-SIDTTMD) ÏÏ 5- ļ OfT" -0- BIOSID TTI(D) -0- BIOSID VCmax + BIOSID Dmax .3 1 i - i i i i i I i i i i 0 40 80 120 160 200 240 PAD CRUSH STRENGTH @ 35% COMP, (pal) Fig 18: NHTSA "side impact" sled test data of arm-down BIOSID and SID on padded and rigid wall side impact sled tests (11). deflection and rib and spinal accelerations were mea- sured (6). TTI again showed a marginal correlation in this data set (Fig 17), similar to that in the Heidelberg sled test data. Deformation-based injury criteria, including D^ and VC^, showed significantly better cor- relation with and demarcation of chest and abdominal injury. As with all similar sled tests, they did not repro- duce the side impact punch, so they may not be valid for judging the effects on chest deflection of specific side impact countermeasures in full-scale crash tests. The absence of the side impact punch may help explain why NHTSA sled testing of SID and BIOSID (11) showed that either dummy will lead to the same padding countermeasure regardless of injury criterion (Fig 18). These NHTSA sled tests used the Heidel- berg-type sled fixture, with various density padding materials on a flush impacting surface. In general, the trends indicated by TTI(d) were similar to those indicat- ed by Dhw, and VC^ among the padding materials tested. However, the risk of injury predicted by the various injury criteria in the same padded test was very different. When ARSAN padding was used, TTI(d) was below 70 g in either dummy, indicating less than a 2% probability of an AIS5 injury (23). Chest deflection, however, was greater than 70 mm, a level at which one may expect severe injury. CDC cadaver tests at the same sled velocity using ARSAN padding showed two separate, critical AIS5 injuries (6). Pendulum Tests The pendulum test reduces the complexity of an occupant impact to its simplest level. In these tests, a free-flight pendulum strikes a station- ary surrogate at specific "anatomic" locations. The pen- dulum's finite, well-defined kinetic energy is the only available energy in the impact. Like a sled test, a free- flight pendulum does not simulate the punch of a side impact. Depending on its shape and size, the pen- dulum may or may not simulate the possible topography of a typical impacting surface. Viano et al performed a large series of pendulum tests with cadavers to establish human tolerance based on deflection-based injury criteria, including VC^ and D«*, (30). Pendulum velocity was the only variable in these tests. As in the Heidelberg full-scale tests, any criterion which varies with severity, or pendulum velo- city, will tend to correlate with cadaver injuries.

Frontal pendulum data do exist in which the pendu- lum mass, in addition to its velocity, is a variable (17). Those tests show that there is a difference in injury causation between a high velocity/low mass impact, where the energy is dissipated primarily by a viscous mechanism, and a low velocity/high mass impact, where the energy is dissipated primarily by a crushing mech- anism. Those data show that VC™, is the better criterion when the velocity of deformation is above 4 m/s, whereas D™, is the better criterion when the velocity of deformation is below that (24). Those data also show that spinal acceleration does not correlate with injury. Pendulum impacts are also simple to model mathe- matically. By varying the parameter values of the Lob- dell model of the chest (20), the model can represent any dummy or a human cadaver in a pendulum impact. Using cadaver parameter values derived from side impact experiments, Viano examined the capability of a large variety of hypothetical padding materials which would reduce VC™, in a pendulum impact (27). Constant crush force materials managed the energy best at a given impact speed. Constant stiffness materials actually provided better protection over a wider range of impact velocities. Although the simulation utilized proper human response parameters, the "opti- mal" padding selected cannot be assured to perform in a side impact because the side impact punch was not simulated, and spacing was not considered. The study may be more applicable to occupant protection in a frontal impact, which the pendulum impact better ap- proximates. Because of its simplicity, the pendulum impact is commonly used to calibrate test dummies. Pendulum tests provide a simple, reliable means to compare impact response of a dummy to that of cadavers, or another dummy. Such comparisons have shown that the impact responses of the Hybrid III frontal dummy (10) and BIOSID side impact dummy (15) are the most similar to those of the human cadaver.

With its stroke and velocity-time history controlled indepen- dently, the impactor may better reproduce the effects of both spacing and padding during a side impact punch. be controlled independently, i.e., its stroke and velocity do not depend significantly on its load. When Deng compared simulation results from pendulum and impac- tor impacts to full-scale side impact data, the impactor impact could better capture the essence of a side impact than a pendulum (7). This is because the impactor, like the intruding door, is a power source or a punch. The energy transfer from the impactor to the surrogate depends on spacing, the stiffness and the topography of the impactor face. We know of no published animal or cadaver data acquired with an impactor programmed to simulate a side impact punch. Kroell performed a series of frontal impactor experiments with the swine (16).

The results showed that VCma&gt; was an excellent predictor of soft tissue injuries such as heart rupture. Since sternal acceleration was measured in those tests, a TTI(d)-like injury criterion based on the peak sternal and spinal acceleration could be calcu- lated. Such a criterion did not correlate as strongly with injury as did VCmax (Fig 21). Conclusions In a frontal impact, the critical event is the oc- cupant striking the interior or loading the restraint in free-flight. EA materials or schemes can improve ride- down and help manage the occupant's effective kinetic energy. They reduce both chest deflection and acceler- ation. In a side impact, the critical event is the station- ary occupant being punched by the encroaching door at a high speed with a self-limiting stroke. Although EA materials like padding can reduce the peak accelera- tions, they may also prolong occupant contact with the side impact punch. Existing crash test data show that padding apparently can increase the net energy trans- ferred to the dummy chest, as reflected by higher chest deflections when padding was added. However, padding can lower TTI(d) in the same side impact crash tests, indicating a milder impact exposure. There- fore, the choice between acceleration-based and deflec- tion-based injury criteria in a side impact may be critical when evaluating countermeasures. Further investigation is needed to determine whether acceleration-based criteria, deflection-based criteria, or both must be lowered to reduce injury risk to humans in actual side impacts. The correct combination of structural changes and padding may lower both TTI(d) and chest deflection in side impact crash tests. A carefully chosen pad may, by itself, reduce both TTI(d) and deflection. However, developing side impact performance using TTI(d) alone may not ensure that the countermeasures chosen will reduce both TTI(d) and deflection.
