(Reprinted from Revue Anthro- pologique, vol. 41, pp. 301-579. Paris: Librarie Emile Nourry, 1931.) There are in France on rough monolithic pillars, on slabs in megalithic tombs and on the walls of rock cut tombs in the Marne a large number of anthropomorphic carvings which have long been recognized as bearing a general resemblance to each other and also as falling into a number of separate groups of more restricted type and distribution. There are in addition other carvings on boulders and megaliths, of other objects, as well as fluted and phallic pillars of clearly different character and of much later date. Commandant Octobon has collected and summarized the ma- terial on all these types of carving in France, illustrating the more important ex-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 387 amples of each. He proposes a classification that is based on mode of occurrence, type of carving, details represented, and regional distribution, and then proceeds to analyze each of his types. He finally suggests the interrelations and relative chronology of the various types. Since most of this material was first discovered in the latter part of last century and was published in the journals of local societies and guide-books, a great deal of it has remained generally inaccessible, and the author has performed a very valuable service in making this corpus. His analysis brings out clearly the contrasts both in style and technique between (a) the anthropomorphic bas-relief carvings in the megalithic and rock-cut tombs of the Paris basin (Seine et Oise and Marne) and in the lower Rhone valley (at Col- lorgues) and (b) the free standing carved statue-menhirs mainly restricted to the southern part of the Central plateau. Among other reasons for regarding the former (a) as earlier is the representation of the hafted stone axe found on these bas-relief carvings as opposed to the hilted dagger found on the rounded sculptures of statue- menhirs attributed to the early bronze age. Attention is not called, however, to the appearance of the dagger in both the N. Italian groups related to (a) and (b) re- spectively. The author produces little evidence for his view that statue-menhirs derive from phallic pillars, for which no prototype is known, elaborated into sculp- tures of human figures, and his comparisons with carvings and statuettes among the furniture of megalithic and other tombs in Iberia and the East Mediterranean is somewhat perfunctory. In the conclusion the author indulges in a number of speculations, at present quite incapable of proof, concerning the significance of the position of the carved slabs in the tombs in relation to putative guardian functions, and he ends in the fashion popular in French archaeological writings of the end of last century, with a long list of rhetorical questions. This is a very useful collection of material and will be a valuable source of reference for workers on megalithic and bronze age cultures of Western Europe. It is unfortunate from this point of view that the text and illustrations have not been better arranged and cross-referenced. Forms which the author shows to be related are not considered in sequence, but are separated by sections on other types, while there are no page references in the comparative sections and no index. The monograph thus becomes unnecessarily difficult and tedious to use. There are a very large number of illustrations, most of them half-tone. For these we must be grateful, but the photographs are mostly old ones taken with little skill, and the blocks are printed on such poor paper that they fall far below the standard neces- sary for the study of such objects and to be expected today. There are no distribu- tion maps. C. DARYLL FORDE</page></plain_text>
