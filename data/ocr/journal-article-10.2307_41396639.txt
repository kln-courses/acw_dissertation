<plain_text><page sequence="1">Doing the Best They Can By Thornton H. Parsons As strategies I Lay Dying to be found has one in of the the modern most novel. precarious Though and it elusive is a strategies to be found in the modern novel. Though it is a depiction of primitive people, it is sophisticated, for Faulkner devised a way of treating them so as to avoid both sentimentality and con- descension. We assume at first that Faulkner is hoping to distract us from a gross attention to plot and thereby to overcome the tradi- tional stark limitations of the episodic road story by his audacious method of presentation, shifting from one consciousness to another with a dazzling versatility; but what ultimately overtakes us is that neither plot nor characterization is predominant, but theme, an implicit set of values governing "familyness" and "Bundrenism." The intricate presentation of As I Lay Dying- the use of numerous, shifting perspectives- is Faulkner's austere refusal to do more than imply, and it throws an unusual burden upon the reader. It is the same burden that must be assumed by the reader of The Sun Also Rises, but with the difference that in Hemingway the norms emerge early in the novel with the telling contrast between the weak and slovenly Cohn and the quietly strong and decorous Jake Barnes, whereas Faulkner prolongs the reader's perplexity about implicit values and sometimes encourages skepticism even about individual versions of what has happened. This perplexity is reflected in the different accounts that critics give of the central point of the book, its principle of form. Some try to find a developing character. Olga Vickery thinks Cash grows in understanding throughout the ten or eleven days covered by the plot. I think this is the wrong place to look for development; it diminishes the subtlety of Faulkner's achievement. There is no movement toward light or self-understanding in any single character. We gain information about some characters that enables us to correct our first impressions, but none of them moves self-consciously toward light. A similar temptation is to take Darl as the main character. We can begin the novel impatiently, assuming that Darl with his perceptiveness and his marvelous insight into all the members of the family is the best and rarest Bundren, and if we cling to this view to the end, we arrive at the high-pitched irony of a family's blind and hopeless [ 292 ]</page><page sequence="2">DOING THE BEST THEY CAN 2Ç3 destruction of its best human specimen. Darl would thus be comparable to some of J. D. Salinger's protagonists- to Holden Caulfield and Seymour Glass- and from this characterization we would deduce the theme that existence is unspeakably harsh and involves a dreadful waste of sensitiveness: delicate, subtle, imaginative people are broken. Parallel- ing this reading would be a negative judgment of the novel's total economy, however, for other strong themes simply do not accord with it. Though Faulkner might have chosen developing characterization as a way of transcending the crude and stark efficiency of the road- story form, he worked much more elusively and covertly, and prolonged the suspense about his artistic design. He kept the appearance of the perennial emphasis upon plot, allowed an overwhelming interest in character to supplant it gradually, and ultimately assimilated charac- terization to theme. Once this dynamic technique is apprehended, we feel the tactlessness of the claim for Cash's miraculous growth in wisdom. The monologues of Cash near the end of the book are more revelatory not because he has undergone a tremendous enlightenment but because it is more plausible that he would be ruminative while riding with a broken leg than while, under the scrutiny of his dying mother, applying his mind to the precise construction of her coffin. Faulkner needs a spokesman for some important emphases at the end, and Cash is the most likely character to funnel them through. Faulkner's design is to exploit impatience and to allow us to believe at first that Cash is insensitive or perverse or vain in seeking his mother's approbation for the coffin which he is building. But Cash is not the only one susceptible to early misunderstanding; a deliberate pattern emerges with other characters. If we are hasty about discovering the norms immediately, and thus placing our sympathy or aversion, Faulkner will allow us to be misled. Our first impression of Jewel, from the perspectives of Darl and Cora, is quite unfavorable. He seems rigid, implacable, unfeeling- always on the edge of anger or indignation, and interested in little besides his horse. However, in the monologue of Darl revealing his intuitive knowledge of Jewel's behavior while feeding the horse, we get a clue that will eventually be important in our assessment of him: he has a curious inseparable mixture of violence and affection. Then in Jewel's next section we discover a jealous love of his mother (which counteracts Cora's testimony), a resentment toward Cash for his apparent obduracy and egotistical obsession with</page><page sequence="3">294 THE GEORGIA REVIEW carpentry and for his sycophancy- his childish effort to please his mother and receive her praise. At this point in the novel we begin to get a sense of Faulkner's skill and economy in presenting psychological complexity. This chapter devoted to Jewel's consciousness serves to qualify somewhat the negative version of Jewel derived from Darl and Cora and at the same time to excite our curiosity about whether Jewel's version of Cash is reliable. We feel some aesthetic suspense, too, realizing that reversal or correction of our first impressions must turn out to be more than a trick or the novel will be vulgarized. We can easily build an aversion to Anse from the information in the early pages of the book. He seems chronically self-pitying, lazy, indecisive, passive, utterly ineffectual. His parsimony is so acute that he resents having to pay a doctor who comes to attend Addie and can only announce that she is dying. Anse's eloquent denunciation of the road is an extraordinary compendium of his weaknesses: indolence begets his resentment toward the road because its nearness to the house compels him to carry out Addie's wish that her body be transported to Jefferson for burial; self-pity and ineffectual wishing are implicit in his theories that without a road nearby Cash would not have heard about carpentry and become interested in it and thus would not have broken his leg in falling off a church, and Darl's eccentricity would not have been noticed by people outside the family and no threats to take him away would have been made; a petty selfishness appears to govern when he fears that the trip to Jefferson will cost money that he might otherwise use to buy some false teeth. Anse seems thoroughly reprehensible, and we shall not be surprised later on to discover that he steals money from Cash, appropriates Dewey Dell's ten dollars, and trades the horse without conferring first with Jewel and getting his permission, or that he so hastily courts and wins another woman while he is in Jefferson for the purpose of burying Addie. Faulkner's immediate aim in the opening pages is to charm us, to glide us, into the milieu of the Bundren family, but concurrently to create suspense by revealing enough about each important character to let us think we discern his particular bias of temperament. A novelist can invent characters that are gradually changed by their experiences or he can manage his characters and events so that change is a phenomenon of the reader's mind as implications accrue. The dynamics of As I Lay Dying depends upon the latter principle. In his first monologue furious Jewel has a violent phantasy of</page><page sequence="4">DOING THE BEST THEY CAN 295 destruction and hate: he imagines himself and Addie on a hill, rolling stones into the faces of the others. Yet, despite this wild jealousy for an exclusive relationship with Addie and despite his apparent estrange- ment from the other Bundrens, Jewel turns out to be the hero of the three crises on the road to Jefferson. He acts each time with astonishing selflessness. In the project of the ill-fated fording he urges his precious horse into the deep water in order to save Cash, who cannot swim. (Just before this incident Faulkner has Darl reflecting upon the time when Jewel was fifteen and earned the horse by an incredible expense of himself, working at night by lantern light to clear forty acres of land for a neighboring farmer.) After providing for Cash's safety Jewel rescues the coffin. Then without any rest he starts diving to recover Cash's tools lost in the river. This mishap at the ford precipitates the second crisis in the Bundrens' Odyssey, for the mules are drowned. Again it is Jewel who keeps the mission to Jefferson alive by sacrificing his horse after Anse has presumptuously included it in a trade with Snopes for new mules. Finally, Jewel helps to save Gillespie's livestock from the fire and suffers burns while singlehandedly wrestling the coffin from the blazing barn. This is a pattern of increasing dramatic intensity, but intensity care- fully protected from overstatement by persistent reminders of Jewel's petty faults- his impatience, sullenness, and anger. Whenever the family's frail and vulnerable mission is jeopardized, Jewel emerges as a self-possessed hero of fierce, relevant action, casually capable of enor- mous personal sacrifice. Faulkner's boldest enhancement of the theme of sacrifice is made through the ingenious handling of Jewel's relation- ship to the horse. Darl's early descriptions of the way Jewel catches the horse in the pasture and brings it to the barn for feeding are symptomatic: Then they are rigid, motionless, terrific, the horse back-thrust on stiffened, quivering legs, with lowered head; Jewel with dug heels, shutting off the horse's wind with one hand, with the other patting the horse's neck in short strokes myriad and caressing, cursing the horse with obscene ferocity. "Eat," he says. "Get the goddamn stuff out of sight while you got a chance, you pussel-gutted bastard. You sweet son of a bitch," he says. Violence and affection are inseparable here as they are later on the road when Jewel's ability to take action keeps saving the expedition</page><page sequence="5">2ÇÓ THE GEORGIA REVIEW from disaster. In retrospect we see how deliberate and meticulous has been Faulkner's design, how subtle have been the preparations for Jewel's momentous investment in the burial at Jefferson. Everybody assumes when Jewel rides away after learning of Anse's trade that he will never be seen again, that he loves the horse earned by his exhausting labor as a fifteen-year-old boy too much to part with it. And it is not merely the fruit of his pain and labor, impressive as that would be, that Jewel sacrifices. Faulkner has been quietly at work on a symbolic motif through Darl's cryptic taunting of Jewel: "Jewel's mother is a horse." Later, in the only section devoted to Addie, we learn of her version of existence as "wild blood boiling along the earth." In obedience to this primordial force in herself she conceived Jewel with Whitfield; and Jewel, we eventually see, is the best exemplar of wild blood: he has no capacity for speculation, rumination, self-expression, but is a virtuoso of violent action. We cannot avoid thinking of the polar temperaments of Darl and Jewel when Addie describes "how words go straight up in a thin line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it. . . . " As Jewel is the living extension of Addie's principle of action, so the horse is a living extension of the wild boiling blood, furious and violent, that governs Addie and Jewel. Working through the feverish psyche of Darl, Faulkner has managed a splendid, unobtrusive mediation between verisimilitude and symbolism. Because Darl has been neglected by his mother and has noticed her special affection for Jewel and has been deeply hurt, he resents Jewel and baits him in the cruelest way he can, by suggesting that Jewel cares more for his horse than for his mother. When he and Jewel are returning to the house to get a wheel for replacement of the broken one, Addie has been dead long enough to attract some buzzards. As Darl sees them hovering over the house, he says, "It's not your horse that's dead, Jewel." Jewel has no verbal resources to counter with except a repeated curse, but his love for Addie is richly authenticated later when he acts upon it, delivering the horse to Snopes's barn at night and tacitly endorsing his father's trade. In equating Addie with the horse Darl's powerful intuition has discovered not only her deceitful lapse in marital fidelity but the deepest principle of her psyche, her emphasis upon wild boiling blood. This is an ambitious strengthening of the symbolic pattern which Faulkner uses to enhance Jewel's sacrifice, for after Vardaman has</page><page sequence="6">DOING THE BEST THEY CAN 297 suffered his hallucinated lesson in mortality, after he has been- at least temporarily- deranged by the experience of his mother's dying, he confuses her with a fish that he caught the same afternoon. Because of this particular delusion of his, Vardaman is ready, some time later, to take literally the complicated insult that Darl keeps repeating to Jewel: "Jewel's mother is a horse," Darl said. "Then mine can be a fish, can't it, Darl?" I said. Jewel is my brother. "Then mine will have to be a horse, too," I said. "Why?" Darl said. "If pa is your pa, why does your ma have to be a horse just because Jewel's is?" "Why does it?" I said. "Why does it, Darl?" Faulkner makes skilful use of anthropomorphism as a symptom of hallucination to buttress his ambitious motif of symbolic connections between Addie, Jewel, and the horse. And it is this extraordinary horse that Jewel sacrifices. Our first strong impressions of Cash come from Jewel and Cora Tuli. Jewel attributes a petty vanity to Cash for stolidly and insensitively making a coffin in view of his dying mother. Cora thinks that Addie is watching Cash work on her coffin "so he would not skimp on it." However, Dr. Peabody has heard a different version from Vernon Tuli, who says that Cash "brings each board up to the window for her to see it and say it is all right." That Addie set Cash to work is supported by Anse when he rebukes Jewel for complaining about the way Cash is working within Addie's sight: "We would be beholden to no man," he says, "me and her. We have never yet been, and she will rest quieter for knowing it and that it was her own blood sawed out the boards and drove the nails. She was ever one to clean up after herself." This speech corroborates Darl's thought in the first section of the book: "A good carpenter. Addie Bundren could not want a better one, a better box to lie in. It will give her confidence and comfort." Cora's skeptical view is thoroughly discredited by the account of Cash's behavior following his mother's death in the afternoon. He works all night, enduring the rain and patiently suffering his father's bumbling interruptions, to finish the coffin and to make it as perfect as he can. He designs it specifically for the shape and weight of Addie's body. Darl's description of his meticulous work supplies an important</page><page sequence="7">298 THE GEORGIA REVIEW comparison that helps us get beyond Cash's apparent stolidity: "Vernon holds the board steady while Cash bevels the edge of it with the tedious and minute care of a jeweller." Even after Vardaman has bored the holes in the coffin, Cash meticulously fashions plugs for them, although- as Vernon Tuli observes- he could resort to some easier method of hiding the holes and nobody would know of it. When the neighbors and friends gather for the funeral service, Cash does not talk to them with perfect coherence because he is obsessed with the peremptory thwarting of his precise workmanship by the women who decided that Addie should be put in the box backwards to accommodate the "flare-out bottom" of her wedding dress. The fine skill of Cash is converted into a gentle act of love that fits the immediate circumstances and needs of the Bundrens. Beneath his rustic literal-mindedness is a rare and touching love of perfection in small things. He scrupulously bevels all the edges of the boards even though it means prolonging his work in the rain. Upon the return of Darl and Jewel from the lumber-hauling job that has caused a three-day delay in the departure for Jefferson, the three oldest boys load the coffin in the wagon. Cash urges that they turn the body around so that it will ride balanced, but Jewel's impatience prevails. It may be that the coffin would not have come off the wagon in the flood if Cash had had his way. Cash stays on the wagon when it is struck by the floating log and tries to protect the coffin even though he cannot swim. Early in the trip, when Jewel's horse kicks up some mud that lands on the coffin, Cash takes a tool from his tool box and removes it, and "When the road crosses Whiteleaf, the willows leaning near enough, he breaks off a branch and scours at the stain with the wet leaves." With his broken leg in an improvised cement cast, he rides sitting on the coffin for several days and endures what must be unspeakable pain without complaining, and at Jefferson even urges that they bury Addie before taking him to Dr. Peabody. This patient and serene suffering and the exquisite craftsmanship devoted to the coffin are his unself-conscious enactment of love for his mother. He spends himself in a subtler and less spectacular way than Jewel does. With his broken leg he can do nothing in the third family crisis, the fire at Gillespie's, but in the first two crises his behavior is admirably selfless. He risks his life to try to save the coffin, and he says nothing when Anse appropriates his money for the mule trade with Snopes.</page><page sequence="8">DOING THE BEST THEY CAN 2ÇÇ Like Jewel, he never lapses into regret or bitterness over the enormous price he has paid for getting Addie to Jefferson. Paradox governs the characterization of Jewel and Cash. Whenever the Bundren solidarity is threatened, Jewel's strength and violence are strangely converted into centralizing acts of devotion and loyalty. The obsession of Cash with carpentry, the endurance of a painful broken leg, and the sacrifice of money saved for a graphophone are sublimed into thank-offerings to Addie. But the greatest paradox of all emerges in the characterization of Anse. Throughout much of the novel it seems that Anse must be despicable. As the norm of relevant action comes to prevail, he looks more and more like an extreme negative example. He whines continually, he pities himself, he is lazy, he mumbles his mouth, he is dependent upon others, he is the ultimately passive man. The great contrast between Jewel and Anse is dramatized by their behavior at the submerged bridge near Tull's farm. "If it was just up, we could drive across," Anse says. "We could drive right on across it." While Anse can contribute only a maundering, childish, regretful hypothesis to this emergency, Jewel is restless for action, impatient to begin the arduous task of fording the river even at great personal risk. When the floating log strikes the wagon, he assumes a triumphant leadership, saving Cash and the coffin and many of the carpenter tools. Yet, to take Anse as merely a contrast to Jewel is to miss one of Faulkner's heartiest ironies. Anse cannot often take effective action himself, but his nearly complete dependency impels, even inspires, others to action. Visiting the Bundrens while Addie is dying, Vernon Tuli volunteers to help Anse and then muses about it: "About that corn," I say. I tell him again I will help him out if he gets into a tight, with her sick and all. Like most folks around here, I done holp him so much already I can't quit now. Other friends, conversing at the funeral, concur in Anse's mysterious power to evoke help: "Well, it'll take the Lord to get her over that river now," Peabody says. "Anse can't do it." "And I reckon He will," Quick says. "He's took care of Anse a long time, now." "It's a fact," Littlejohn says. "Too long to quit now," Armstid says. "I reckon He's like everybody else around here," Uncle Billy says. "He's done it so long now He can't quit."</page><page sequence="9">ЗОО THE GEORGIA REVIEW Several days later Armstid is ready to lend his mules to Anse after the calamity at the ford, but Jewel's delivery of the horse to Snopes's barn obviates his offer: ... Be durn if there ain't something about a durn fellow like Anse that seems to make a man have to help him, even when he knows he'll be wanting to kick himself next minute. And if it hadn't a been Jewel, I reckon it'd a been me; I owe him that much, myself. I be durn if Anse don't conjure a man, some way. I be durn if he ain't a sight. These remarks are not invitations for us to feel indignation toward Anse. There is something marvelous about his unaggressive, passive ability to make others act on his behalf. Because his motives in going to Jefferson are not pure, are not restricted to the fulfillment of his promise to Addie, he should not be singled out for scorn. This is an important emphasis of Faulkner's: purity of motive is inimical to human life. The living survivors cannot subordinate themselves entirely to the deceased person. They have a right to- cannot sanely avoid- a mixture of motives. Nearly every Bundren has a private reason for going to Jefferson apart from the communal one of burying Addie with her kinfolks. Cash hopes to buy a graphophone there, and he carries his tools with him so that he can stop at Vernon Tull's on the way back and do some work for him. Anse suspects, justly perhaps, that Jewel would like to show off his splendid horse. Vardaman wants to see the toy train. Dewey Dell is intent upon getting to a drug store and buying a medicine that Lafe has assured her will effect an abortion. Anse wants to get some store teeth, and after we finish the novel we wonder, in retrospect, whether even before he left home he had thoughts of finding another woman. Dependent and passive as Anse usually is, he is the one who sets the journey in motion by his promise to Addie, he is the implausible leader; and when Dewey Dell suspects that Samson might be persuading the family to settle for the New Hope churchyard, Anse is the one she delivers her urgent pleas to. Not spectacular but ironic is his leader- ship. Laziness, stubbornness, and dependency are his unlikely cre- dentials. As his motives are impure, so are his methods. After Jewel has kept the mission alive by saving Cash and the coffin at the ford, Anse keeps</page><page sequence="10">DOING THE BEST THEY CAN 3OI it alive by the questionable appropriation of Cash's money (saved for the graphophone) and the presumptuous trading of Jewel's beloved horse. Given Anse's temperament, we cannot expect him to move with cleanly principled strokes toward an idealistic goal. He is a perennial bumbler, a loser. What saves him- and this is the point to be emphasized about the acquisition of the mules- is an immunity to despair. At the moment when he might be expected to succumb to the overwhelming misfortune and accept the futility of the family's errand, he stirs himself to take ragged and sullied action. Snopes undoubtedly fleeces him, and the trade is another example of the exorbitant cost of keeping the promise to Addie. To Armstid's offer to lend mules Anse says, "She'll want to go in ourn," and he stubbornly hews to this purity at least and confines himself to the resources of the traveling Bundrens. Whether he is thinking mainly about Addie's burial or store teeth, his brazen action has the effect of concentrating Bundren energy and purpose at a critical moment. Whether he treats the property of Cash and Jewel with the proper respect for individual rights or not, his decisive behavior here confines the sacrifice to the Bundren family. Whether Cash and Jewel cooperate with the decision out of a desperate resignation or not, the chance to carry out the sacred promise to Addie is kept open. Even our contempt for the most unattractive trait of Anse- his self- pity- is greatly mitigated by the very unfolding of the story. When he announces (in the fifth section), "I am a luckless man. I have ever been," we may assume that a glib overstatement of his bad luck is part of his general unattractive eccentricity; but after the unsuccessful at- tempt to ford the river, when Cash is lying on the shore, having nearly drowned, and Jewel and Tuli are diving for the tools, we can feel the astonishing truth of his claim, "If ever was such a misfortunate man." Eventually we have to admit that, if anything, he understates his troubles, for though he is certainly aware of enough "trials and floutings," Faulkner has arranged for us to be aware of even a greater number of afflictions and deprivations that beset him. By the end of the novel the incredible list runs like this: Anse has had no teeth for years; his wife felt a deep contempt for him during their marriage, and even begat a son with the preacher; one son is odd, and threats have been made to have him institutionalized; one son seems perpetually angry; Addie dies; one son is deranged by grief, and while making holes in the coffin to give his mother air bores the auger into her face several</page><page sequence="11">302 THE GEORGIA REVIEW times; a wheel is broken during the lumber-hauling trip and the funeral expedition is delayed three days; the bridges are out or impassable; the coffin is lost in the water; Cash barely escapes drowning and breaks his leg, the leg he broke earlier in a fall from a church, and a makeshift cast is applied by Darl and Anse; the mules are drowned; Jewel loses his horse in the trade for new mules; neighbors and townspeople register disgust over the smell of the putrescent corpse; buzzards hover over- head throughout the journey and even approach the coffin at times; Jewel gets burned in saving the coffin from the fire set by Darl in Gillespie's barn; Dewey Dell is seduced by a drug-sto/e clerk, victimized in an infamous deception because she is apprehensive over her pregnancy; Darl is committed to the asylum in order that a lawsuit over the fire may be avoided. Here we see how brilliantly Faulkner has made his presentation serve the design of the novel. Working through the consciousness of individual Bundrens, each limited by an irrevocable temperament, he can imply the serene and casual good faith that enables the family to persist in an enterprise that seems to us more futile with each new experience. It will not do to inquire too closely into precisely what enables any man to resist despair. Anse Bundren should be over- whelmed by the number and quality of his misfortunes, but though he makes ritual noises in complaint of his lot, he has a wiry toughness and stubbornness that render him immune to despair. He is one of Faulkner's shabby heroes of endurance. Faulkner reveals the shabbiness early and reminds us often that it is inseparably part of Anse's character, but we see gradually that, like Jewel's anger and Cash's stolidity, it can be strangely redeemed. Faulkner's ways of altering our feelings toward Anse are marvelously subtle, always quietly and indirectly dependent upon our retrospection. Anse has too many statements, delivered in the inevitably just idiom of the rural poor Southerner, that we come to perceive as profound thematic epitomes of the novel, for us to persist in scorning him. He says of Addie, "She was ever one to clean up after herself." Setting Cash to work on her coffin is not a symptom of morbidity at all but a serene acceptance of a natural fact. Addie's resolution to clean up after herself precipitates the ensuing events of the book. In accepting and abiding by Addie's request to be buried in Jefferson, Anse incurs for himself and the other members of the family all the outrageous misfortunes enroute. If thought upon, if analyzed much,</page><page sequence="12">DOING THE BEST THEY CAN 303 burying the dead- performing a metaphysical cleaning-up- could loom as the most appalling of human responsibilities. It is outrageous that we should be expected to do it. It calls preëminently for primitive action and mindless faith. Faulkner sustains throughout the book a resourcefulness in creating thematic reverberations from low-keyed, innocuous statements. As with Eliot's telling line in The Waste Land- "What you get married for if you don't want children?"- the pleasurable aesthetic effect comes from our realizing only later that so important an idea could be pre- sented so casually, consonant with the demands of racy dialogue. Given the circumstances- Addie's request that harmonizes with some private motives of her survivors, the family's limited resources, the grotesque collection of misfortunes, and the fierce individual obsessions- no fairer evaluation of Anse's efforts could be made than the assertion of Armstid: "He's getting her into the ground the best he can." In the same section Anse himself says, "I do the best I can." Two sections after this one, as they are preparing to put Cash's broken leg in cement, Anse says, "We're doing the best we can." Clean, efficient executions are simply not possible for the Bundrens, but they stay on the road with their precious burden and make momentous if clumsy sacrifices for it. "We can make out," says Anse. "It ain't no luck in turning- back." Jewel contributes the most strength and overt stamina to the mission, and he makes the most dramatic sacrifice to sustain it. Cash offers an artist's precision and delicacy to the coffin, and later suffers uncom- plainingly. Bumbling, ineffectual Anse, though, turns out to be the ironic spring, the one who initiates the journey and revives it at the most dismal, hopeless moment. Jewel's love is suffused with anger and resentment. Cash's serene patience is induced partly by his obsession with carpentry; as he rides along in pain he consoles himself by touching his carpenter's tools. Anse inspires effort in others by his sheer help- lessness and saves the mission from despair and implausibly unifies the family at a critical moment by ignoring individual rights. Family unity is the overriding norm of the novel. That it is possible at all, considering the enormous diversity of temperaments, is another commonplace miracle of existence. Even Dewey Dell, who regrets that she is so anxious over her pregnancy that she cannot feel the proper grief at her mother's dying, is alert and helpful and gentle when Cash is ill from his near-drowning and when he wears the makeshift</page><page sequence="13">304 THE GEORGIA REVIEW cast, and when Jewel gets burned in rescuing the coffin from Gillespie's barn. What sustains a family and makes endurance and continuity possible is the intuitive (not self-conscious) ability to act or cause to act, to sacrifice or cause to sacrifice, in the communal interest. This is the main controlling idea of the book. Faulkner saves his greatest irony for the end. In committing Darl to the asylum the Bundrens would seem to be victims of disunity, but in the context of unspeakable expenditures for modest achievements the family's pragmatic decision to surrender Darl to the authorities may be seen as an unconscious purging of discord. Darl is addicted to words, abstractions, that do not issue in action. He is sterilely preoccupied with his own imagination, and he can easily and frequently get himself into a mood of despair or a longing for his own dissolution: "If you could just ravel out into time. That would be nice. It would be nice if you could just ravel out into time." He intuits the pregnancy of Dewey Dell and knows of her anxiety, but he does nothing to comfort her; he prudently leaps off the wagon in the river and leaves Cash, who cannot swim, to deal with the coffin alone; he can only add to the confusion of Vardaman as he takes him to Addie's coffin to listen for her voice; and finally he succumbs to a sense of futility and tries to sabotage the whole mission by burning the coffin and corpse. As Cash understands, it is possible to view Darl's act of arson as the appropriate and rational response to an absurd persistence in a futile project. However, one of Faulkner's strongest themes in this novel is the awesome disparity between what things are worth and what people must pay for them. When we see what ludicrous refine- ments are made upon outrageous sacrifice, we suspect that Faulkner is intensifying his point and at the same time using comic hyperbole to avoid a tone of regret. The Bundrens can succeed in their purpose only because they are not overwhelmed by a sense of cosmic injustice; they ingenuously accept the accruing misfortunes and do not dramatize themselves as victims. Anse, Jewel, Cash, and Dewey Dell seem quite immune to despair. They cannot think themselves into a paralysis. They set out for Jefferson for the purpose of cleaning up after themselves, and they do the best they can. Cash recognizes the investment of Jewel in the corpse and coffin ("in a sense it was the value of his horse Darl tried to burn up"), but he does not take account, as we do, of the enormous investment of the whole family in fulfilling the promise to Addie. Weighing</page><page sequence="14">DOING THE BEST THEY CAN 305 all the quintessences of devotion, hardship, outrage, and sacrifice that Faulkner has consigned to the mission, we cannot take the position that Darl was right. As Addie's corpse becomes more putrescent, it becomes more precious to the Bundrens, because each day on the road is expensive in different kinds of pain and privation. Cash per- ceives Jewel's most obvious kind of sacrifice, but he does not think about his own or the subtle other kinds of expenditures which Faulkner has impressed upon the reader: Jewel's strength, coordination, and agility required to save the coffin at the river, the burns he suffers at Gillespie's; Dewey Dell's persistent anxiety along the way that can be relieved (she thinks) in Jefferson; Anse's stubborn adherence to the letter of the promise he made; Vardaman's misery which is exacerbated by the ordeal of the journey; even Darl's agony over the irrationality of it all. Furthermore, the reader has access to information that has symbolic import and that Cash is not self-conscious enough to per- ceive: the attenuated sacrifice of a horse that has a symbolic relationship to Addie and Jewel as an embodiment of "wild blood"; and the fulfilled prophecy of Addie that Jewel would save her after her death ("He is my cross and he will be my salvation. He will save me from the water and from the fire. Even though I have laid down my Ufe, he will save me"). This prophecy is given further support by a statement of Tull's that mediates nicely between the somber tone of Biblical prophecy and the racy, local milieu of Southern farmers: the Bundrens, Tuli says, "would risk the fire and the earth and the water and all just to eat a sack of bananas." Here is another of Faulkner's splendid epitomes of Bundrenism and of human destiny- the fidelity to sublime idealisms in a context of petty egotisms. Addie is buried, Darl committed; then the family eats bananas in Jefferson. Faulkner does not invite us to scorn or to deplore this economy. Human existence is inevitably a grotesque mixture of the sublime and the trivial, the sacred and the profane, the idealistic and the practical, the heroic and the paltry, the altruistic and the selfish. Nothing un- does a person more than the unrealistic demand for rationality or for purism. I think there is a suggestion of healthy accommodation to realities in Anse's acquisition of a new wife. He fulfills his promise to Addie, then gets his store teeth and a wife to cook his turnip greens. Peabody says that "Anse has not been in town in twelve years."

Anse does not straggle or chafe against the con- vergence of discordant events. The trip to Jefferson is a momentous one for him; it has religious, hygienic, and marital consequences, all flowing together. His marriage is the fulfillment of another prophecy, by the neighbor Kate, early in the novel: "... He'll get another one before cotton-picking." Regretting the grotesque mixture of noble and selfish motives, or analyzing it too much, can bring on trouble like Darl's. Cash is Faulkner's unobtrusive spokesman as he makes the final statement about Darl: "This world is not his world; this life his life." But this is the world of Anse, Cash, Jewel, Dewey Dell, and Vardaman. They have successfully completed their religious errand- Addie has been delivered intact to Jefferson and buried with her people- and now her children sit in the wagon eating bananas as Anse approaches with his duck-shaped woman, who carries a graphophone. The Bundrens are casually ready to carry on an existence whose harshness they suffer naturally and whose possible injustice they are mercifully ignorant of and will not brood about; and with their easy, unthinking acceptance of a necessarily alloyed existence go hope and faith. The Bundrens do not know that in their expedient decision to avoid a lawsuit by committing Darl to the asylum they lopped off the member of the family who most threatened its unity and solidarity. If the reader detaches himself from the milieu that Faulkner has so richly created and sustained, he may find himself regretting the waste of sensitiveness, of imaginative power. No such norm emerges from the novel, however. Tuli expresses the idea that is confirmed by the plot and characterization when he is musing "About all the sorrow and afflictions in this world": Now and then a fellow gets to thinking about it. Not often, though. Which is a good thing. For the Lord aimed for him to do and not to spend too much time thinking, because his brain it's like a piece of machinery: it won't stand a whole lot of racking. It's best when it all runs along the same, doing the day's work and not no one part used no more than needful. I have said and I say again, that's ever living thing the matter with Darl: he just thinks by himself too much.</page></plain_text>
