Materialien zur Archäologie der Nordgebiete Pakistans 4. Mainz: Philipp von Zabern, 2001. xiii + 385 pp. + 63 pp. (Urdu), 125 pis., 4 maps. This hefty volume of petroglyphs and inscrip tions from Shing Nala and Gichi Nala in the Upper Indus region of northern Pakistan is an ex cellent successor to the previous three volumes on Oshibat, Shatial, and Hodar in the series Ma terialien zur Archäologie der Nordgebiete Paki stans, edited by Harald Hauptmann.1 Although Shing Nala and Gichi Nala are about 40 km apart, both "Felsbildstationen" feature Buddhist images of stupas and graffiti written primarily in the Brähml script belonging to the period from approximately 400-600 c.e. Earlier petroglyphs at Gichi Nala are documented, along with later drawings at both stations. Following the format of previous volumes of MANP, this volume in cludes thorough descriptions, analytical essays, and a very well-illustrated catalog. The valuable documentation of almost 1,200 petroglyphs and inscriptions from Shing Nala and Gichi Nala sig nificantly enhances the published corpus of rock art and graffiti in the Upper Indus region.2 Shing Nala, located approximately thirty km upstream from Chilas on the right bank of the Indus River, is remarkable for its concentration of Buddhist petroglyphs. Most of the Buddhist images and inscriptions are clustered around a large geological formation at the center of the station called a "glacier mill" (Gletschermühle) (p. 57). This natural feature periodically fills with water and serves as a place to rest in the shade of overhanging rocks. Buddhist images and in scriptions predominate among 420 engravings at Shing Nala, with between 150 and 160 drawings classified as stüpas. Five stüpa images are unusu ally large drawings over two meters in height (nos. 14:8, 20:4, 35:1, 39:2, 59:1), and more than thirty are larger than a meter (p. 34). In addition to the characteristic dome (anda), stüpas at Shing Nala generally have several rectangular founda tions (medhi) and rows of discs [chattiavail). More ornate drawings include additional archi tectural and decorative features, such as pillars with animal capitals, pilasters, niches, bells, ban ners, and various types of crowning elements (pp. 33-43). Renderings of vases and lotus blos soms are distinctive at Shing Nala, perhaps be cause lotuses (which are not native to the Upper Indus but could have been cultivated in the pool of the glacier mill) may have been used to adorn the stüpa drawings (pp. 25-27). Adorants, includ ing one figure who seems to be dressed as a Bud dhist monk (no. 58:2), are sometimes portrayed paying homage to stüpas (nos. 39:3, 40:2). Ditte Bandini-König suggests that two very large Bud dha figures (nos. 38:13 and 47:2) may have been drawn by a professional artist (p. 58), but indi vidual devotees created the majority of Buddhist images at Shing Nala. Non-Buddhist petroglyphs of discs, tamgas, riders, animals, and axes are gen erally found outside of the central area around the glacier mill and usually belong to later periods. Sixty Brahml inscriptions typically record the names of visitors responsible for Buddhist im ages at Shing Nala.

Almost 300 Brahml inscriptions are very capably read by Oskar von Hinüber, but almost a third are il legible or incomplete (p. 108). Among the legible Brähm! inscriptions in the eastern part of the station, there are numerous invocations to the Buddha as well as to other Tathägatas and Bodhi sattvas (including some figures with previously unattested very long names). Buddhist dedica tions are also frequently attested, with 25 ex amples of formulae with devadharma-, krta, and dharmahetuvarada. Numerous visitors' inscrip tions in the western part of the station provide a window for viewing onomastic patterns. Many Iranian or hybrid Indo-Iranian names are note worthy, including several names likely to belong to a group of travelers clustered on stone 144. Repetition of the names of some visitors who wrote their names at other sites allows their routes through the Upper Indus region to be re constructed (p. 109). The name of Valavira occurs in four inscriptions at Gichi Nala (nos. 35:1, 92:4, 102:2, 157:8), including once inside a quadran gular outline with drawings of horses and a bird (Group 92:A, pi. XH-a). Other remarkable graffiti include nos. 157:4 (translated by von Hinüber as "Der Schauspieler Kajakärikä futuit die Mrgottikä") and 157:16, which gives bio graphical details about Somadatta Somavira, the son of Horumaysa-kritana, born in the country of Aryahima(*la)ya. Only two suggestions for mi nor corrections to the reliable and accurate read ings of Oskar von Hinüber may be offered: p. 260, no. 97:5: for jaya(bha)rdrah read jayacan diah p. 265, no. 108:6: for (kula)dh(rajga grihati read ku(la)bhaga grihati. An especially helpful feature of this volume is a cumulative index of close to 1,200 Brahml and Kharosthl inscriptions in the first four vol umes of MANP compiled by Ditte Bandini König (pp. 339-77). Oskar von Hinüber makes useful comments on proper names in the inscrip tions (pp. 383-84). A comparative table of types of petroglyphs and inscriptions in MANP 1-4 (pp. 118-21) and thematic and general indices to the description of materials and essays are also useful tools for researchers. Contributions by W. Bernhard Dickore on the flora and vegeta tion of the Chilas area and by Günther A. Wag ner on possibilities for numerical dating of the rock surfaces help to clarify related technical issues. The petroglyphic and epigraphic materials that have been exhaustively cataloged and described in Die Felsbildstationen Shing Nala und Gichi Nala are clearly important for specialists in rock art and Indian epigraphy. Audiences with inter ests in local Buddhist devotional practices will find many fascinating examples of Buddhist im ages and dedicatory inscriptions. Data collected from a wide array of rock drawings and inscrip tions will surely contribute to a better under standing of the history of the Upper Indus River Valley, which linked ancient Gandhära, Swat, and Kashmir with the Tarim Basin. Notes 1. Previous volumes of MANP are reviewed in BAI 11 (1997 [2000]), pp. 217-24 and BAI 13 (1999 [2002]), pp. 179-82. 2. At the time of this review, another volume in the series is available: Ditte Bandini-König, Die Felsbild station Thalpan, vol. 1, Kataloge Chilas-Biücke und Thalpan (Steine 1-30), MANP 6 (Mainz, 2003). 3. In a review of MANP 3 and 4 in Orientalische Literaturzeitung 96 (2001), pp. 753-58, Harry Falk speculates that these figures were not "giants" but outlines of medium to large males offered as human sacrifices. While the dimensions of the drawings are not gigantic, Falk's vividly imaginative hypothesis of human sacrifice seems farfetched. Jason Neelis</page></plain_text>
