<plain_text><page sequence="1">Uprooting the Lyric: Baudelaire in Wagner's Forests JOSEPH ACQUISTO Richard Wagner's arrival on the Parisian opera scene rocked Paris in i860.1 Small riots also broke out the next year, when Wagner staged Tannhauser in Paris. To defend Wagner against his Parisian detractors, Charles Baudelaire wrote Richard Wagner et Tannhauser à Paris, his only music criticism, an essay that would also turn out to be a fundamental performance of Baudelaire's own esthetics. I examine here the intertextual relationship between Wagner and Baudelaire, arguing that the latter's reworking of Wagner has important implications for the status of lyric poetry reinscribed within an urban context. My analyses of a network of intertexts will suggest that Baudelaire transformed his consideration of music into a prolonged meditation on memory. It is through his reflections on textual and cultural memory that Baudelaire rewrites the nature of esthetic experience in the early 1860s. Toward the end of the first section of Richard Wagner et Tannhauser à Paris, between two paragraphs, Baudelaire inserts the quatrains of his famous sonnet " Correspondances" : Le lecteur sait quel but nous poursuivons: démontrer que la véritable musique suggère des idées analogues dans des cerveaux différents. D'ailleurs, il ne serait pas ridicule ici de raisonner a priori, sans analyse et sans comparaisons; car ce qui serait vraiment surprenant, c'est que le son ne pût pas suggérer la couleur, que les couleurs ne pussent pas donner l'idée d'une mélodie, et que le son et la couleur fussent impropres à traduire des idées; les choses s'étant toujours exprimées par une analogie réciproque, depuis le jour où Dieu a proféré le monde comme une complexe et indivisible totalité. La nature est un temple où de vivants piliers Laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles; L'homme y passe à travers des forêts de symboles Qui l'observent avec des regards familiers. Nineteenth-Century French Studies 32, Nos. 3 &amp; 4 Spring-Summer :</page><page sequence="2">Comme de longs échos qui de loin se confondent Dans une ténébreuse et profonde unité, Vaste comme la nuit et comme la clarté, Les parfums, les couleurs et les sons se répondent. Je poursuis donc.2 This charged moment interrupts the argument Baudelaire had been developing and directly links music with poetry and esthetic perception more generally. Is this interpolation of "Correspondances" a restatement in verse of the preceding claims?3 Is it a continuation of the preceding paragraph, or a new idea, a further development and expansion? This incorporation of the poem highlights the Wagner essay's status as a text, in the etymological sense of a weaving together of pre-existing materials. Margaret Miner indicates the ways in which Baudelaire's citation of Franz Liszt earlier in the Wagner essay colors the appearance of the citation from "Correspondances": Readers might briefly consider that "Dieu" is a true original, situated safely beyond the domain of translation, but Baudelaire's quotation from "Correspondances" throws doubt on this possibility as well. Because it comes so soon after Liszt's program, the poem's famous first line [... ] resonates differently than it might in other contexts. For Liszt, the temple [...] is a uniquely musical structure, founded and built by [Wagner's] prelude's motif in order to guarantee listeners' passage between ephemeral artworks and eternal transcendence. With Baudelaire's quo tation of his quatrains, however, the temple itself becomes a motif, passing from musical painting to poetry: [...] the temple can assure passage only from one art to another rather than to higher spirituality. (49) I would like to extend Miner's intertextual analysis, arguing that the citation of "Correspondances" leads the reader not even from one art to another but rather from one text to another, as this early poem returns to haunt and transform, and be transformed by, the essay. Baudelaire's importation of part of "Cor respondances" invites an examination of the vertical transports between Wagnerian texts and his own. By placing these verses within a context wholly different from their original place in Les Fleurs du mal, Baudelaire calls for a new interpretation of his previous work.4 In fact, Baudelaire has left a trail of references, scattered throughout his writings in the early 1860s, that should give us clues as to how to re-interpret this fragment of "Correspondances." I read the blank spaces surrounding the verse as "une lacune complétée par l'imagination de l'auditeur" (002: 782), the mandate to interpretation that, according to Baudelaire, is always there in music, painting, or the written word.5 The 224 Joseph Acquisto</page><page sequence="3">"lacune" is, additionally, a space that Baudelaire himself will fill with his textual memory of pre-modern esthetic experience, a feeling of transport than can be echoed or reproduced, but never recuperated, by recalling and rewriting the experience.6 Ultimately, then, a series of intertexts will provide clues about how one should read the "Correspondances" fragment, just as the fragment itself provides the mandate for emphasizing the role of textual memory and transformation within Baudelaire's work. To begin to account for the "Correspondances" fragment, I would like to consider a passage from a text that Wagner published in French as an introduction to his esthetics, the Lettre sur la musique of i860. The following passage toward the end of the essay stands out from the rest by its sustained lyric tone: [La grande mélodie] doit donc d'abord produire dans l'âme une disposition pareille à celle qu'une belle forêt produit, au soleil couchant, sur le promeneur qui vient de s'échapper aux bruits de la ville. Cette impression [...] consiste [...] dans la perception d'un silence de plus en plus éloquent. [... ] Celui qui se promène dans la forêt, subjugué par cette impression générale, s'abandonne alors à un recueil lement plus durable; ses facultés, délivrées du tumulte et du bruit de la ville, se tendent et acquièrent un nouveau mode de perception; doué pour ainsi dire d'un sens nouveau, son oreille devient de plus en plus pénétrante, il distingue avec une netteté croissante les voix d'une variété infinie qui s'éveillent pour lui dans la forêt; elles vont se diversifiant sans cesse; il en entend qu'il croit n'avoir jamais entendues; avec leur nombre s'accroît aussi d'une façon étrange leur intensité; les sons deviennent toujours plus retentissants; à mesure qu'il entend un plus grand nombre de voix distinctes, de modes divers, il reconnaît pourtant, dans ces sons qui s'éclaircissent, s'influent et le dominent, la grande, l'unique mélodie de la forêt; c'est cette mélodie même qui dès le début l'avait saisi d'une impression religieuse. [... ] Plus il s'abandonne sans réserve à ce spectacle, plus les armées d'étoiles de la voûte céleste se révèlent à ses yeux, distinctes, claires, étincelantes, innombrables. Cette mélodie laissera en lui un éternel retentissement; mais la redire lui est impossible; pour l'entendre de nouveau, il faut qu'il retourne dans la forêt, qu'il y retourne au soleil couchant. (64-65) This amazing passage reads like a Baudelairean prose poem, or, rather, like a pastiche of Baudelaire's most famous images. Nearly all of Baudelaire's main topo'i are present in the single phrase "celle qu'une belle forêt produit, au soleil couchant, sur le promeneur qui vient de s'échapper aux bruits de la ville ' (my emphasis). The long, sustained meditation on the relation between forest and esthetic experience merits careful comparison with Baudelaire's treatment of these same questions in "Correspondances" and the Wagner essay generally. Nineteenth-Century French Studies 32, Nos. 3 &amp; 4 Spring-Summer 2004 225</page><page sequence="4">What Wagner outlines is a series of experiences parallel to those described in the quatrains of "Correspondances." Wagner's forest voices that go along "se diversifiant sans cesse" equal Baudelaire's "longs échos qui de loin se con fondent." There is the same slippage between variety and unity among the voices of the forest, with Wagner's "voix d'une variété infinie" becoming "la grande, l'unique mélodie de la forêt." Similarly, Baudelaire's sounds "se répondent" and hover somewhere between confusion ("se confondent") and "une ténébreuse et profonde unité." The Wagnerian and Baudelairean forests, then, have much in common. What varies radically, however, from Wagner to Baudelaire is the status of the perceiving subject who enters this metaphorical space and the nature of the esthetic experience he is to have there. Wagner's perceiving subject is active. Once he (the masculine pronoun is Wagner's) is able to cast off the inter ference of modern life, he elevates himself to a higher level of esthetic experience where he is able to hear the sounds of the forest in their infinite variety and unity and their full intensity. The figurative forest walk produces an act of revelation on the part of nature, where not only the music of the forest but also the sight of phenomena beyond the forest itself become accessible. This ultimate clarity of sound and vision stands in stark contrast to the experience of Baudelaire's forest walker, who has a much smaller role to play in "Cor respondances." Wagner's esthetic subject lingers for a while in the forest and gradually opens himself up to the experiences around him. His journey is a linear one, progressing from outside noise to silence to the melody of the forest and then on to the revelation of a host of stars. Baudelaire's generalized perceiving subject, by contrast, is simply passing through: "L'homme y passe à travers des forêts de symbols / Qui l'observent avec des regards familiers." The subject is even transformed into an object, as active nature, anthropomor phized as a human-built edifice, gazes at the passing and passive human figure. Humanity disappears from the poem after the first quatrain, before we get to the "ténébreuse et profonde unité." We are left, in the first quatrain, with the famous forest of symbols and "de confuses paroles." Wagner's subject had been able to hear and be transformed by the mysterious sounds of the forest, but it is unclear whether Baudelaire's subject even hears those confused words. Nature speaks them, to be sure, but man in his passing does not even listen, much less understand. Direct esthetic perception and transcendence is already relegated to memory, as Wagner's actively engaged subject is rewritten as one with no access in the present to esthetic transformation. In order better to interpret the truncated citation of "Correspondances" within the wider intertextual context of the Wagner essay, it is helpful to turn to some of the other poetry that Baudelaire was writing around the same time. It is 226 Joseph Acquisto</page><page sequence="5">in some of these other poems that Baudelaire makes an explicit connection between memory and esthetic experience, and in so doing, he gives us clues to the interpretation of the passage in question in the Wagner essay. "Obsession," for example, is a sort of unmasking of the esthetic experiences suggested in "Correspondances."7 Paul de Man characterizes the opposition between the two poems in this way: Stated in generic rather than historical terms, the relationship between "Corres pondances" and "Obsession" touches upon the uncertain status of the lyric as a term for poetic discourse in general. The lyric's claim of being song is made explicitly in "Correspondances" ("qui chantent les transports ..."), whereas "Obsession" howls, laughs, and speaks but does not pretend to sing. (254) Baudelaire sent "Obsession" to his publisher, Poulet-Malassis, on February 10, i860, exactly one week before Baudelaire penned a letter to Wagner and around the time he was seriously contemplating the Wagner essay. As the forest shifts from locus of the highest esthetic alchemy to site of horror for the poetic subject, Baudelaire rethinks and rewrites the experience of correspondences throughout this network of texts. The impersonal third-person pronouns of "Corres pondances" become the situated first-person singular of "Obsession" and, ultimately, the fragmented, performative "je" in the guise of several writerly voices in the Wagner essay. In his letter to Wagner of February 17, i860, Baudelaire writes that he owes to Wagner "la plus grande jouissance musicale que j'aie jamais éprouvée."* As noted above, Baudelaire then goes on to situate his writing within the ongoing Parisian controversy over Wagner's operas, saying that he might not have been en couraged to write to Wagner had he not constantly read newspaper articles that attempted to malign his genius. He then announces his intentions in writing the letter while at the same time announcing the impossibility of accomplishing those goals: "Ce que j'ai éprouvé [en écoutant de la musique wagnérienne] est indescriptible, et si vous daignez ne pas rire, j'essaierai de vous le traduire" (Corn: 672). After outlining at some length the visions that came to his mind as he listened to Wagner's music, Baudelaire once more takes up the theme of the conditions of writing about an esthetic experience: J'avais commencé à écrire quelques méditations sur les morceaux de Tannhauser et de Lohengrin que nous avons entendus; mais j'ai reconnu l'impossibilité de tout dire. Ainsi je pourrais continuer cette lettre interminablement. (Corn: 674) Baudelaire's use of transitions gives rise to puzzling questions. He abandons the attempt to write about Wagner's operas because he knows that his writings could Nineteenth-Century French Studies 32, Nos. 3 &amp; 4 Spring-Summer 2004 227</page><page sequence="6">never be complete. To borrow Margaret Miner's term, there is an irremovable gap between esthetic experience and the possibility of creating from the raw material of the experience a plausible written description. Within the space of one week in February, i860, then, Baudelaire is torn among esthetic jouissance, the impossibility of describing it fully, and the terror of psycho-esthetic experience that makes one desirous of a void where all correspondence would cease and the anxiety-producing harmony of nature would become the reassuring unity of nothingness. "Obsession" responds to and reads the letter to Wagner as much as it responds to and reads "Corres pondances": the impetus to transcribe his experience in listening to Wagner falls into the same kind of eternal recurrence, the narrative that never ends, the unwritten interminable letter, as the regression of experience in "Obsession," where the dark night, the infinite nothingness, become the site for further esthetic experience in the form of visions dancing before the poet. Jouissance, then, lasts but a moment, whereas the effort to preserve it through transcription into written form is a source of torment, an eternal and futile effort to recapture, through memory, the pleasure of a moment. The erasure of what can never be found again calls to the attentive reader's mind another poem, first published on January 22, i860, just a few weeks before the publication of "Obsession" and the composition of the letter to Wagner. Here are the final three stanzas of "Le Cygne": Je pense à la négresse, amaigrie et phtisique, Piétinant dans la boue, et cherchant, l'œil hagard, Les cocotiers absents de la superbe Afrique Derrière la muraille immense du brouillard ; A quiconque a perdu ce qui ne se retrouve Jamais, jamais! à ceux qui s'abreuvent de pleurs Et tètent la Douleur comme une bonne louve! Aux maigres orphelins séchant comme des fleurs! Ainsi dans la forêt où mon esprit s'exile Un vieux Souvenir sonne à plein souffle du cor! Je pense aux matelots oubliés dans une île, Aux captifs, aux vaincus! ... à bien d'autres encor! (oci: 87) Dedicated to Victor Hugo, Paris' most prestigious exile in i860, "Le Cygne" famously brings together the mythic imagination of the ancient Greeks, Romans, and the Haussmannization of Paris under Napoléon hi.9 The con clusion of the poem, with its open-ended series of images, has inspired many commentaries on its portrayal of the limitless bounds of memory. Often read in 228 Joseph Acquisto</page><page sequence="7">conjunction with the second of the "Spleen" poems ("J'ai plus de souvenirs...") another instance of the endless accumulation of memories that haunt the poetic imagination, "Le Cygne" is a performance of the eternal substitution of signifiers.10 In a work depicting a poetic imagination in which "tout [... ] devient allégorie" (v. 31), modern Paris can become ancient Greece and Andromache can be linked to any other figure of exile. In the midst of the urban landscape, painted earlier in the poem with references to the Carousel (v. 6) and the Louvre (v. 33), the poetic subject finds himself at the conclusion of the poem, among the varied images presented in rapid succession, in that most poetically-charged of settings in Baudelaire's corpus, the forest. The city, while it is certainly an object of poetic reflection in "Le Cygne," cannot be the site of such reflection. The poet pauses in the midst of the series of images to situate that reflection in the first two verses of the final stanza. The forest is the site of voluntary exile ("où mon esprit s'exile," my emphasis) of the mind, and Baudelaire's estheticization of exile via the use of the forest trope complements Victor Hugo's own self-imposed political exile. The final scene of the poem represents a most extraordinary fragmentation of the poetic subject, whose body remains in Paris while his mind retires to the figurative forest, which becomes the site of recuperation of memory. This Memory is expressed not through the "langage inconnu" of the forest of "Correspondances," but rather as music, which is, in turn, the result of the physical action of blowing the horn. The music could easily have come instead from the rustling of the trees or the song of the birds, but rather, the music is the result of a human body blowing air through a human-crafted musical instru ment. The body giving sound to the horn - the cor/corps - substitutes for the absent body of the poet in the forest. With "Le Cygne," Baudelaire adds two crucial dimensions to our un derstanding of the place of "Correspondances" in the Wagner essay and of the role of memory in recuperating and transforming esthetic perception. First, it is only within memory that esthetic experience can be said permanently to reside. The ever-elusive jouissance of hearing Wagner's music is an inherently tem porary phenomenon that Baudelaire uses writing to recover and prolong. Its existence in subsequent moments of time is entirely dependent upon memory. Wagner's music, like the old city of Paris, has been relegated to an unattainable mythic past, where only writing can recuperate it by preserving a faint memory of the experience. What is perhaps the impossible task of writing the experience becomes nevertheless essential in the preservation of its memory. Once the experience is given new form as writing, a new object is created, a new text, which opens the way for another community of readers to interpret it, simul taneously preserving and altering the tradition of hearing or of reading. The loss Nineteenth-Century French Studies 32, Nos. 3 &amp; 4 Spring-Summer 2004 229</page><page sequence="8">that is always already absent is, in the case of the Wagner essay, analogous to the esthetic experience itself.12 Baudelaire pursues the impossible project of translating his sensations into written form in order to preserve and communicate them, and yet the experiences are irretrievable from the start, and, in any case, they are altered by their transposition into writing. The whole of the Wagner essay, like the whole of "Le Cygne," is a meditation on the effect of trading the permanence of writing for the irretrievable origins that are the writing's signified. This journey through the intertexts that construct the relationship of memory and esthetic experience should return to where it began, with the forest passage in Wagner's Lettre sur la musique that serves as the text of origin from which Baudelaire's essay swerves. The metaphorical space that Wagner and Baudelaire evoke is the city. Both writers construct the urban space within their texts as the opposite of the forest space, a metaphor for a mental state whereby one cannot exercise one's faculty of esthetic perception. The extended com parison in Wagner's text makes this point clear. The perceiving subject is first characterized as "le promeneur qui vient de s'échapper aux bruits de la ville" (Wagner 64), and the subject's faculties, once they reach the forest, are described as "délivrées du tumulte et du bruit de la ville" (64). The forest space is set up in opposition to the city in Wagner's text as well as in Baudelaire's. Esthetic experience is possible only when one is removed from the urban context, a figure of the realist, as opposed to the artistic, realm. Withdrawal is necessary for contemplation, and retreat into the figurative forest, i.e. a mental state conducive to esthetic reflection, becomes the condition of possibility not only of the appreciation of art but also its very perception. Lost in the noise of the city, so the extended metaphor runs, it is impossible to hear the music of the forest. In the same way, following Wagner's analogy, it is impossible to hear and be moved by melody in a noisy urban space. At this still superficial level of comparison, Wagner and Baudelaire are in agreement, and each relies on the trope of the forest as anti-urban environment to further his esthetic theory. On further examination, though, Baudelaire's use of urban and forestial geographies is more nuanced and subtle, his rhetorical strategies more complex, than Wagner's. In "Le Cygne," there is a further complication of metaphoric substitution. To appreciate how Baudelaire complicates the trope of music in the forest, it is necessary once again to return to Wagner's forest-music passage in the Lettre sur la musique. Near the conclusion of the passage, Wagner emphasizes the transitory nature of the esthetic experience: "Cette mélodie laissera en lui un éternel retentissement; mais la redire lui est impossible; pour l'entendre de nouveau, il faut qu'il retourne dans la forêt, qu'il y retourne au soleil couchant" (Wagner 65).13 For 230 Joseph Acquisto</page><page sequence="9">Wagner, then, the music of the forest, the ideal object of esthetic perception and meditation, is completely inaccessible outside its geographical and even its temporal realm. Not even reconstruction through memory can recover the lost experience. Once transferred to the city, it is impossible to conceive of any kind of experience of ecstasy through contact with art. What remains is an in significant impression, a "retentissement," a vague shadow that, above all, cannot be communicated to others. In Baudelaire's reworking of Wagner's scheme, the categories that are fixed in Wagner become destabilized. For Wagner, memory plays a role in esthetic experience only after that experience has ended. The "retentissement" is a figure of absence, a replacement for the music of the forest when the subject finds himself in a different spatio-temporal location. In "Le Cygne," by contrast, memory has a role to play within the forest itself. In fact, memory or, more precisely, a memory, becomes the agent, the source of the musical sound. The resulting music is not at all a simple "retentissement" but rather a loud, broad sound: "Un vieux Souvenir sonne à plein souffle du cor !" (v. 50). It is no longer clear whether the poetic subject is hearing the music or the memory. While Baudelaire has borrowed Wagner's geographical metaphor of the forest, his text confounds music and memory in a complex metaphorical relation where the memory is like music but the music itself is the memory. All of this substitution takes place, not within a metaphorical forest strictly speaking, but rather within a forest space created by the mind of the poetic subject: "la forêt où mon esprit s'exile" (v. 49).14 The anthropomorphism of "Correspondances" and "Obses sion" is completed with the third term in that succession of poems, "Le Cygne," where memory reshapes and gives new significance to experiences and to the metaphors Baudelaire uses to describe them. Having retraced this network of metaphors among Baudelaire's lyric poetry and back through Wagner's prose, we may now at last return to the questions of textual memory and transformation posed by the quatrains of "Corres pondances" within their new context in section one of Richard Wagner et Tannhàuser à Paris. It is unclear whether Baudelaire intends the quatrains of "Correspondances" to serve as an example, illustration, extension, or confir mation of the ideas he has just expressed in prose, namely, that it would be surprising if colors could not suggest melody or that sounds and colors could not translate ideas (002:784). It is important to note first of all that God, present in Baudelaire's prose in this instance, is conspicuously absent from "Corres pondances."15 The universe of "Correspondances" is marked, not by vertical analogies allowing humanity to penetrate the secrets of a deity, but rather by a relentless horizontality. The only vertical imagery in the quatrains is the living pillars, whose words are not even perceived by the human subject horizontally Nineteenth-Century French Studies 32, Nos. 3 &amp; 4 Spring</page><page sequence="10">traversing the forest. A further horizontal network is established among "les parfums, les couleurs et les sons," but again there is no passage to a vertical axis. The human subject follows its path and the sensory expressions follow their own without any interaction between the two. This relentless horizontality reinforces Baudelaire's new emphasis on memory as the vehicle for recu perating esthetic experience. The horizontality of memory provides a linear model of esthetic perception, allowing transport, not from one art to another, but from present to past, and, more importantly, from text to text, as esthetic experience is simultaneously created and remembered. This new model of quasi-nostalgic, quasi-creative esthetic memory replaces a vertical conception of music and poetry as transcendence and allows us better to understand the omission of the tercets from the citation of "Correspondances" in the Wagner essay.16 By extracting the quatrains not only from the context of Les Fleurs du mal more generally but also separating them from their tercets, Baudelaire tears apart and forces into fragmentation what is for many an "étonnant chef-d'œuvre d'unité profonde et de clarté complexe."17 Baudelaire's citational practice privileges fragmentation over unity and fundamentally alters the character of the poem. Here are the tercets that Baudelaire omits: Il est des parfums frais comme des chairs d'enfants, Doux comme les hautbois, verts comme les prairies, - Et d'autres, corrompus, riches et triomphants, Ayant l'expansion des choses infinies, Comme l'ambre, le musc, le benjoin et l'encens, Qui chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens, (oci: u) The unity thematized in the poem is emphasized structurally by the union of these two tercets into a single sentence. The famous series of comparisons introduced by the word "comme," begun in the second quatrain, continues chiefly in the tercets. Whether the "comme" introduces a term of comparison or, as de Man has remarked of the final occurrence of the word, a simple series of examples, these enumerations mark equivalence and expansion of the range of images within the poem (249). Thematically, the realm of the infinite comes into play, as do the horizontal correspondences in the final verse, where all of these images are related back to the human subject and its spirit and senses. The omission of these tercets, then, changes the poem considerably. Whereas in the complete sonnet we are left with the image of horizontal correspondences between nature as symbols and esthetic transcendence or transport, in the truncated citation there is only the strictly dual world of sensory phenomena never reaching the grounded human subject. Gone is the reference to the infinite, the only temporal reference in the quatrains being the less grandiose 232 Joseph Acquisto</page><page sequence="11">"parfois" referring to the occasionally spoken words of living pillars. Perhaps the most relevant word of the tercets missing from the Wagner essay is the verb "chantent," the only musical reference in the poem. Without the tercets, the senses are not transported and there is no singing, no music. In other words, the most central esthetic experiences that Wagner brought to Baudelaire, the transport of the senses and the emotions through music, and specifically singing, are the very experiences that are edited out of the Wagner essay when "Correspondances" is transposed there.18 This section of Richard Wagner et Tannhàuser à Paris is, then, the most direct and performative example of the reinscription of the lyric within memory as Baudelaire develops it in "Obsession" and "Le Cygne." It is thus only by way of a detour through the Wagner essay that one can trace the consequences of Baudelaire's transformation of esthetic experience into memory. By frag menting the unity of "Correspondances" by fracturing the text at its cleavage point, the point tournant between the quatrains and the tercets, Baudelaire performs the undoing of the argument as constatively stated in this section. One may not go back, after all, to the forest, to the origin of the esthetic experience. One can move horizontally among various translations of experience in prose or poetry, but one cannot ascend once more to a new horizontal level of esthetic transport. The opera sounds in Baudelaire's mind only as a memory, whereas the crisis over it continues, just as, in "Le Cygne," the poet remains firmly planted in the modern city, never to return to that Paris which exists no longer. The forest of "Le Cygne," like the forest of "Correspondances," has been uprooted. In "Le Cygne," it is relegated to memory. In the latter poem, it is transposed and radically reinterpreted in the new context of the critical essay in prose. Wagner, in his own passage on forests, claimed that one cannot have a distinct impression of the music of the forest without returning there. In reply, Baudelaire swerves away from Wagner and reinterprets the supposedly uni versal Wagnerian art in the new context of the modern French city inscribed within the lyric; Baudelaire shows that the figurative forest of esthetic transcendence is gone and that a return is as necessary as it is impossible. In this light we may read new meaning in his assertion that "tous les grands poètes deviennent naturellement, fatalement, critiques" (0C2: 793). The new context, the modem city, necessitates a new poetry, as exemplified in "Le Cygne." It also calls for a new relationship to art and accords a crucial role to memory. Baudelaire rethinks the forests of his own first period of lyric poetry and relegates esthetic experience to the forest of memory, which he carries with him and which enters into the very heart, the very center of the Wagner essay, surrounded on both sides by prose descriptions of crisis. The "lacune" of esthetic experience is filled by horizontal correspondences among a network of Nineteenth-Century French Studies 32, Nos. 3 &amp; 4 Spring-Summer 2004 233</page><page sequence="12">intertexts, and this textual and cultural memory takes the place of immediate and unmediated transcendence in an eternal present.19 Baudelaire thus de stroys the lyric mode as it had been characterized by lyric poets of the early nineteenth century and by Wagner in the 1860s. Baudelaire has, in this way, through the violent excising of the lyric tendency, fatally become a critic; his next major publication as a poet will be his prose poems. And yet the lyric tendency survives the crisis even as it is transformed by it. Baudelaire's essay sketches the possibility, not of the elimination of the lyric within modern life, but rather of a new role for poetry, as a lyric for and of memory. One becomes fatally but also joyfully a critic; the impulse to write about esthetic experience, even inspired, as Baudelaire writes to Wagner, by the context of crisis, preserves that experience in at least some faint copy or translation. The purity of esthetic experience in the forest is now reinscribed within the logic of citationality, disunity, fragmentation, and crisis. None theless, the forest image still remains alive within the poetic imagination, or rather, within memory, as the imaginary forests remembered by the dismembered poetic subject of "Le Cygne" and reinscribed in the Wagner essay as Baudelaire looks both forward and back and thereby transforms his esthetics.

Further references will appear in the text as "oci" or "ocz." 3 This is not the first time Baudelaire has interpolated verse into his critical articles. See, for instance, the Exposition universelle, where he cites Théophile Gautier (0C2: 590), and his own poem "Les Phares" (0C2: 595). As I hope to show, however, his performative rhetorical strategies are very different in Richard Wagner et Tannhàuser à Paris. 4 Eugene Holland writes an account of the differences between the quatrains and tercets of "Correspondances," noting that Baudelaire eliminated the tercets from the Wagner essay. Holland's analysis concentrates on the tensions within the sonnet itself rather than examining the context of the comments surrounding its citation in the Wagner essay. See Baudelaire and Schizoanalysis, 76-79. 234 Joseph Acquisto</page><page sequence="13">5 "Dans la musique, comme dans la peinture et même dans la parole écrite, qui est cependant le plus positif des arts, il y a toujours une lacune complétée par l'imagination de l'auditeur" (0C2: 781-82). 6 Again I take as a point of departure Margaret Miner's observation that, right from the start of Baudelaire's programmatic description of Wagner's music, he "cate gorizes his program as a memory, an account of past experience. . . . But it quickly becomes clear that for Baudelaire, the program not only describes one level of memory, but also leads toward other, more distant levels. . .. For Baudelaire, to listen to the prelude is to engage in remembering, and to write about the prelude is to remember remembering" (Miner 50). I hope to show that, in the Wagner essay and in other Baudelairean texts of the same period, it is this new emphasis on memory that replaces an earlier conception of immediate and transcendent esthetic experience. 7 "Obsession," like "Correspondances," begins in the forest: "Grands bois, vous m'effrayez comme des cathédrales; / Vous hurlez comme l'orgue; et dans nos coeurs maudits, / Chambres d'éternel deuil où vibrent de vieux râles, / Répondent les échos de vos De profundis" (oci: 75). 8 Charles Baudelaire, Correspondance (Paris: Gallimard, 1973), 1: 672.

Hugo seems to have played a role similar to Wagner's in Baudelaire's poetico-critical imagination, both men resembling larger-than-life figures of the artist to be respected and followed yet not imitated. 10 See Jonathan Culler, The Pursuit of Signs (144-45). 11 Gérard Gasarian notes the change from the usually soft horn of memory to the bolder music in "Le Cygne": "The horn that blows at the end of the poem has lost the soft, distant, and sad sound it traditionally has in French lyric poetry (as in Vigny's 'Le Cor' or Apollinaire's 'Cors de chasse'). By raising the volume of the horn, which is blown here full blast, Baudelaire deliberately drowns the melancholic overtones of this romantic instrument. With its first letter capitalized, moreover, the old 'Souvenir' turns into a timeless allegory that is disconnected from the poet's personal souvenir" (127). 12 Nathaniel Wing writes of the conclusion of "Le Cygne": "Poetic thought is no longer delimited by the semantic horizon of the allegorical signified; it breaks that horizon by the repetition of an endless discontinuity. Each allegorical figure reiterates the impossibility of retrieving a lost origin; the loss which is allegorised here is that which is always already absent" (15). 13 This remark of Wagner's calls to mind of course Baudelaire's "Coucher du soleil romantique," published one year following the Wagner essay. This poem shares with Nineteenth-Century French Studies 32, Nos. 3 &amp; 4 Spring-Summer 2004 235</page><page sequence="14">"Le Cygne" its storehouse of imagery united in the mind of the poet who is incapable of re-establishing what time has removed: "Je me souviens! . . . J'ai vu tout, fleur, source, sillon / Se pâmer sous son œil comme un Coeur qui palpite [...] / Mais je poursuis en vain le Dieu qui se retire" (oci: 149). Here, the death of romanticism is the explicit thematic interest of the poem, whereas in "Le Cygne" it is through allegorical reading of that poem where "tout devient allégorie" that we can see the relationship of the city to esthetic experience. 14 My claim that Baudelaire uses a network of texts, and in particular "Le Cygne," to offer new insight on the idea of "correspondences" is supported by Baudelaire's own comment in the Wagner essay: "Mais les phénomènes et les idées qui se produisent périodiquement à travers les âges empruntent toujours à chaque résurrection le caractère complémentaire de la variante et de la circonstance" (002: 790). 15 Jonathan Culler notes, albeit dismissively, the absence of God from "Cor respondances" as a significant difference between Baudelaire and his romantic pre decessors who also wrote about esthetic experience in the forest, specifically Hugo and Lamartine (121). 16 A significant change in typography from the "Correspondances" of Les Fleurs du mal to the "Correspondances" fragment of the Wagner essay seems to have escaped the attention of Baudelaire critics. The "Nature" of the full poem becomes, in all editions of the Wagner essay, simply "nature." Read in the context of the other poems on which Baudelaire had been working around i860, this small typographical change acquires considerable significance. Baudelaire's reconsideration of the capitalization of "nature" represents a move away from the sublime Nature of Hugo and other Romantics. Just as in "Obsession" the forests and oceans turn out to be the very human constructions of an obsession, so too "Nature" becomes demoted to "nature," no longer the site of a quasi-sacred communion with higher powers but rather a too often-written poetic cliché. 17 Jean Pellerin, cited by Claude Pichois in the notes to "Correspondances." See oci: 847, n. 11. 18 The high stakes involved in the inclusion or excision of the tercets is highlighted by Robert Pogue Harrison. Of "Correspondances," he writes that the objects within the poem "assume what Walter Benjamin has called an 'aura' that contains vague reminders of a lost kinship between subject and object. The deadly Cartesian separation between the res cogitans and the res extensa gives way, in the forests of symbols, to an ecstatic psychological state - a 'transport of the mind and senses' - which recovers the realm of correspondences in their predifferentiated unity" (180). 19 The year following the composition of the Wagner essay saw the publication of "Le mauvais vitrier," a prose poem whose first few paragraphs are often overlooked in favor of the main plot of the glazier. In the third paragraph of the poem, a friend of the poetic subject, "le plus inoffensif rêveur qui ait existé, a mis une fois le feu à une 236 Joseph Acquisto</page><page sequence="15">forêt pour voir, disait-il, si le feu prenait avec autant de facilité qu'on l'affirme généralement. Dix fois de suite, l'expérience manqua; mais, à la onzième, elle réussit beaucoup trop bien" (oci: 285). The rhetorical game presented here, playing with fire in a forest for the pleasure of observing whether it will burn, represents the same sort of recasting of the lyric as the displacement of the forests of "Correspondances" in the Wagner essay.
