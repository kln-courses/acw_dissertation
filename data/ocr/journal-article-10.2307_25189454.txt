<plain_text><page sequence="1">M. REINACH'S THEORY OF SACRIFICE The chief characteristic of all writers on the histoiy of religion is their determination to see only one explanation of any fundamental feature in it. Sir J. Frazer, with Mannhardt, finds in every form of worship the presence of vegetation rites, and, similarly, M. S. Reinach remains, despite his admiration for Sir J. Frazer, convinced that the original form of sacrifice is, indeed, not the gift form, but the communion sacrifice of Robertson Smith, involving the ceremonial eating of the animal which is the totem of the clan at fixed intervals, in order to strengthen the bond of unity between the clan and its totem. It must, however, be remembered that M. Reinach has a special view of the nature of totemism which distinguishes him</page><page sequence="2">M. RElNACIl's THEORY OF SACRIFICE 543 from other believers in totemism : he does not consider the totem as primarily an ancestral spirit,1 but holds that the relation of man to an animal is due to a hypertrophy of the social instinct which permits the formation of any human society by prescribing the relations of friendship between members of the same clan. The effect of Al. Reinach's theory is therefore that early worship consists in the sacramental eating of the animal which is regarded as the deity of the elan, and that in course of time the animal god disappears before anthropomorphism, with the result that the animal ceases to be considered as the god, but falls instead into the position of an attendant or adversary of the god killed by him ; while on the other hand the sacrifice becomes regarded as the gift to the god of some animal, either a favourite of the god or disliked by the god. His principles, in fact, may be summed up as animal deities before anthropomorphic deities: sacrament before gifts. To this theory the only real objection lies in its universal application : that there are cases in which it is perfectly applicable should not be denied, for animal worship?the term totemism is so meaningless that it had better be avoided?is to all appearance a genuine early form of religion, and that some animals which appear in the entourage of gods were themselves once really regarded independently as divine, should not be denied. Nor in some cases can we doubt the sacramental sacrifice, and it may be remarked that Al. lieinach by remaining fast to the original view of Robertson Smith, frees himself from the difficulties engendered by the theory of Sir J. Frazer that the slaying of the animal is an annual effort to restore the strength of the spirit of vegetation or pastoral life. But it is necessary to deny that all religion is of one type and to reassert the view that the connexion of an animal with a deity need not mean that the deity 1 Cidff.*t Myth?*, tt Belifjions, i, 39.</page><page sequence="3">544 M. reinach's THEORY OF SACRIFICE was originally an animal, and that the gift theory of sacrifice has its due place as an original conception. It is not impossible to find that M. Reinach himself is ly no means quite consistent in his views. In his essay on Samson,1 which dates from 1912, we find that he insists on finding the original form of Samson in a lion with mane, which was identified later, it seems, with the sun, and he expressly denies that there are any solar myths, believing instead in animal and vegetable myths. The case of Samson is certainty not at all strong in his favour, for all that is necessary to cover the legend of that hero is to assume that it hides the legend of a sun hero, the lion being identified with an incorporation of the sun : the lion is not the sun, but the sun is present in the lion, which therefore is p&gt;ro tanto divine. The nature of such a belief is perfectly indicated by the fact that at Heliopolis a lion was kept in the temple as the repre sentative of the sun-god worshipped there: it is idle to suppose that the lion was the god: the sun was the deity, but doubtless in the minds of the more primitive of the worshippers the lion was realty an abode of the divine spirit, while to the more refined the lion wras a symbol of the god. But apart from this case, M. Reinach himself, in an earlier paper on Phaethon published in 1908,2 expressly admitted that the course of the sun could give rise to the myth of the sun each evening bathing its horses in the waves of the ocean, so clear a case of solar myth that his denial of such myths in his treatment of Samson is certain!}' an inconsequence. 31. Reinach's actual treatment of the Phaethon myth is of interest, as it is a good example of the pressing to undue limits of the desire to find explanations of myths from ritual. It is curious that in face of the flights of fancy found in folklore it is thought necessary to trace every myth to some definite origin : the old school, which 1 Cultes, Mythes, el Ilelu/ions, iv, 148-0(?. 3 Ibid, iv, 45-53.</page><page sequence="4">M. RElNAGTl'S THEORY OF SACRIFICE 545 found in each detail of the myth the natural phenomenon which accounted for it, is no more absurd than the new school which ignores human imagination and believes that for every myth some origin must be found in ritual. In this case the ritual consists in the practice of burning a horse alive as an offering to the sun or plunging the horse into water. From this usage there gradually grew up the idea that the burning of the horse was a punish ment, and so the growth of the Phaethon legend. The explanation is quite incredible: it leaves to the mytho poetic function practically the whole of the story, and it is better frankly to admit that that faculty created the story from nothing more abstruse than the fact of the daily path of the sun and the view that the sun travelled in a chariot with horses. The ritual itself, however, deserves some attention, as the explanation given of it by M. Reinach is not altogether simple or satisfactory. For once he does not find any totemism in the horse sacrifice, though perhaps this is an inadvertence. He denies, however, as a matter of course, the gift theory : the sacrifice is in his view entirely a magic rite in origin intended to strengthen the sun in its performance of its important functions, and is to be paralleled with the numerous fire rituals observed iu Europe and in other parts of the earth. Only later, when gods were conceived as anthropomorphic, was the sacrifice understood to be a gift. This solution presents a series of great difficulties which should not be ignored. The assertion that anthropomorphism is foreign to early religion is not one which can be supported by any evidence whatever. The fact that the earliest representations of the gods take the form of pillars, not of statues, is of course of no value as proof of the view that the gods were not conceived as anthropomorphic : Indian religion shows us clearly anthropomorphic conceptions at a time when statues were</page><page sequence="5">546 m. reinach's theory of sacrifice clearly not thought of. The same religion equally shows theriomorphic conceptions of deities : the fact evidently is simply that both ideas naturally occur to peoples which do not distinguish betwreen men and animals in such a way as to render it impossible to combine anthropo morphic and animal ideas of their gods.1 In the second place, part of the foundation on which JL Reinach has built, the interpretation of the fire rites in Europe as solar spells, has been undermined by the fact that Sir J. Frazer no longer2 holds Mannhardt's view 3 that the burning of animals at the summer festivals and the rolling of burning wheels are sun spells, but accepts, on the contrary, the view of Westermarck4 that the burning is intended to destroy the witches in human or animal form, the same purpose being served by the hurling of lighted disks through the air to destroy the fiends therein. It is quite probable that Westermarck is right in his interpretation of many of the phenomena, especially the burning of animals or human beings. If that view is accepted, the same principle would have to be applied to many cases in which Sir J. Frazer has seen the death of the god annually as a rite for the securing of the strength of the species, and, indeed, it is hard to see how any of the original theory of the Goldeoi Bough could logically5 be held to survive : moreover, the use of fire against the Raksases is one of its most constant uses iu Vedic ritual, an idea which is doubtless a more primitive form of the belief in witchcraft. But the throwing of discs and the rolling of wheels are much more likely to be direct sun spells, as is suggested by the round white skin representing the sun for which an 1 Reinacli, Cnltes, Mythes, et Beligions, i, 38, n. 1. 2 Balder the Beautiful, i, 328-4(5 ; ii, 1-44. 3 Der Baumkullus der Germanen, pp. 521 sec|(j. 4 Ceremonies and Beliefs connected with Agriculture . . . in Morocco, pp. 1)3-102. 8 Sir J.

Now the actual facts of the offerings made to the sun in which horses figure are very scanty though important. Our chief authority is Festus, when, in connexion with the October Horse at Rome,1 he mentions that the Lacedaemonians used to offer a horse to the Winds on Mount Taygetos, scattering its ashes, after it had been burned, to the winds; that the lllyrian tribe of Sallentini offered to their Jupiter, called Menzana, a horse which they threw alive into the flames; and that tbe Rhodians each year used to throw into the sea quado'igas Soli cooisecoxitas, tbe reason given being quod is tali rehiculo fertur cWcuonvehi mundum. From these cases M. Reinach deduces the rule that the horse was primitively burned alive or drowned : he recognizes that the notice of Festus does not refer to actual drowning of horses at Rhodes, though the passage has often been cited for that purpose 2 and though it is possible that thus to take it improves the sense of the citation. He holds further that, while in course of time the actual drowning of horses was abandoned, the car or cars were still set on fire, and that once the chariot horses?originally but one horse?were burned. But both these assertions are purely conjectural, and, what is more important, there is no proof offered that the gift theory of sacrifice is not really the idea at the bottom of the rites. If, as even M. Reinach admits, it is an early view that the sun has a chariot and horses, and, indeed, is represented as a horse, the offering to be made to the god would naturally be a horse and chariot together or separately : it is perfectly true that to present the god thus with the means of his locomotion, is at the same time a means of making him stronger and better fit to carry out his function of traversing the heaven, but 1 pp. 1711 se&lt;m. 2 u.g. O. (jtuppe, (hiechische My/hnhgie, p. 830.</page><page sequence="7">548 M. reinach's theory OF SACRIFICE this fact is iu no way inconsistent with the sacrifice being a gift. It is often forgotten that the gift theory of sacrifice allows of two different applications of the gift: in the one case the gift is mainly intended to make the god propitious to the giver; it strengthens the god doubtless, but the chief aspect in the mind of the offerer is the favour of the god, not the strengthening of the god : in the other the offerer seeks in the main to strengthen the god, of course with the idea of securing his favour, but not with that as the more immediate point on which his aim is fixed. In both cases, however, the attitude of the offerer is that of one who presents : in magic rite pure and simple the performer produces effects, and is neither an offerer nor a suppliant. There is no possible way to prove that magic is older than sacrifice or vice versa. Applying these principles we can see at once that the throwing of the cars in the water may have been simply a magic rite : we are not told that they were offered to the god, though they were consecrated to him : the offering, indeed, would lie in the consecration rather than in the throwing into the sea. But in the case of the offering to the Winds, or, according to Pausanias,1 to Helios on Taygetos, the ceremony was clearly an offering, as in the case of the ottering of the Sallentini to their god. According to Festus'the ashes of the horse in the case of the former ottering were scattered to the winds to be borne far and wide, and it would be vain to deny that this is intended to secure prosperity, probably for the crops and the cattle. But here again we have no need to see in the rite the operation of magic pure and simple : if the horse is burned as an offering to the sun, and is at the same time conceived as being closely connected with the sun, which is regarded sometimes as a horse, sometimes as borne in a chariot, then it is certain that the animal is at the time of sacrifice distinctly full 1 iii, 20. 4.</page><page sequence="8">m. reinach's theory of sacrifice 549 of the divine essence : the fire, too, is closely connected with the sun, and the cinders of the victim must clearly have divine potency in them. M. Reinach deduces from the ritual that the idea that a horse should be offered to Poseidon is derived from the practice of throwing the horses into the water as a piece of sun magic. But clearly this is contrary to all probability, and runs counter to the fact that as early as Homer1 we find offerings of animals made to rivers, including horses. The origin of the offering may be found in the fact that the waves of the sea are regularlv regarded as horses by primitive imagination, and the choice of animal might be dictated by that fact. The essential principle is that the ottering of any animal may be due to many different causes, and that it is impossible to construct a po9iori theories of the development of sacrifice and to insist on adapting the facts to them, without perverting the interpretation of religious phenomena. M. Reinach is doubtless led into his attitude towards the problem of the origin of religion by the view, upon which he insists, that the beginnings of religious belief are to be traced among primitive savages such as now exist in various parts of the earth. He commends2 M. Durkheim for not even dealing with the obvious objection that primitive savages do not really exist at the present day, and that the primitiveness of the alleged savage may consist in tbe fact that he is the production of ancestors who have wandered from the track of progress into superstitions which have prevented the development of tbe race. It is idle to regard this theory as absurd, for it is impossible even to make it probable that it is : the world is not young nor is the life of man young, aud arguing from the merely empirical point of 1 Iliad, xxi, 132.

RElKACll'S THEORY OF SACRIFICE view it is clear that the possibility that different races have developed different forms of religious belief is undeniable. Hence the only real progress which can be made in the field of religious investigation is not to be sought in the sphere of discovering the origin of religion, which is properly a fundamental problem of philosophy, not of science, but in that of arranging religious phenomena under definite categories and tracing when evidence allows the developments of religious beliefs. Where no evidence is available, it is the duty of religion as a science to note the fact and not fill in the blank by wild conjecture. The extraordinary dangers of the a jwiori practice of reasoning are neatly revealed in Sir J. Frazer's latest theory of totemism.1 He now suggests that the totem is the place of deposit of the souls of man, or of his souls if he is taken as having more than one2: initiation ceremonies he shows often take the form among savages of a second birth after a simulated death,3 the real object being permanently to transfer the soul to some external object for greater safety, a rite carried out especially at the danger period of puberty. The theory is supported by the evidence that the Battas of Sumatra, who believe that man has seven or three souls, hold that one is always external to the man, but that whenever it dies the man dies also. But, unfortunately for the theory, Sir J. Frazer frankly states that there is no evidence that the external souls of these people are held to be in the totem. This somewhat serious difficulty is removed by laying stress on the secrecy of savages, especially concerning so important a thing as the location of the soul, with which the man's life is bound up. In support of this view 1 Balder the. Beautiful, ii, 218-25. - He might lmve compared the live constituents of the personality and the live souls of Iranian belief (Moulton, Early Zoroatftriaviam, pp. 250 seqq.). 3 Cf. the Vedic Diksa.</page><page sequence="10">m. reinach's theory of sacrifice 551 Sir J. Frazer quotes the evidence of Messrs. Hose and MacDougall1 that one of them lived for fourteen years with the Ibans before realizing the importance of one of their institutions. The fact is noteworthy and is of course paralleled in the case of Mr. Howitt in Australia, but Sir J. Frazer fails to draw from it the obvious con clusion that to build hypotheses on the practices of savages is infinitely more dangerous than to erect them on the records of classical and Indian antiquity, for the latter were not handed down by students of ethnology under the bias of theory and dealing with peoples to whose life they are essentially strangers by birth, by language, and by mental capacity. If it be objected that it is possible to obtain from these tribes explanations of the real meaning to them of the rites they follow, the reply is that of M. Reinach,2 himself a firm believer in the doctrine of the homogeneity of religion, namely, that the accounts given by peoples of their rites are normally subject to grave doubt, since they represent, not primitive views, but reflections on these views ; he enforces his doctrine by the case of the theory held by most savages that their totems are ancestors, which is in his view a mistake. Equally on Sir J. Frazer's view modern savages do not understand the origin of their totemistic worship, for they certainly do not ascribe it to the source alleged by Sir J. Frazer. In one not unimportant respect M. Reinach's views differ for the better from those of Sir J. Frazer in that he prefers the evidence of classical antiquity to the con clusions drawn from the examination by anthropologists with preconceived theories of the rites of savage tribes. Unhappily his attitude towards the Vedic and Indian evidence is prejudiced by the error which he has made of considering that for primitive religion it is useless to 1 Pagan Tribes of Borneo, ii, 90 seqq. 2 Cultes, Mythes, et Religions, i, 37 seqq. jras. 1916. 36</page><page sequence="11">552 M. reinach's THEORY of SACRIFICE search in the Veda, an idea apparently generated by the belief that the Veda contains nothing but the hymns on which Max Muller founded his mythological theories. The disadvantages of this view are curiously illustrated by his treatment of the possible connexions between Indian and Greek art. The nude statues of the Tirtha karas are held by him to be certainly derived from the archaic type of " Apollo " which flourished in Greece in the middle of the sixth century n.c, and he suggests1 that either a statue of this type was taken at an early date to India, where it served as a model for the wooden statues which he assumes preceded those in bronze, or that when the Jaina artists began after the Christian era to erect statues in stone they sought for archaic specimens of Greek art to serve as models, and chose those which they calculated to be contemporary with the period of the Jina Mahavira. In support of this theory he mentions the fact that an ivory figure of a priest and one of a lion found at Ephesos show similarities to Buddhist art. He also argues that the seated figures of the Buddha are really derived, like the seated figures of Gaulish gods, with limbs crossed, from an ancient Ionian prototype of the sixth century B.C. It is perfectly clear that there is no possible ground for supporting these hypotheses : the nudity of the Jaina statues is of definite religious purpose, while that of the Apollo statues has no such simple origin,2 and the attitude of the figures of the Buddha is a perfectly natural Oriental, as it is also a Gallic, attitude, while it is difficult to say which of M. Reinach's theories of the connexion between the Greek work of the sixth century n.c. and the Indian is the more improbable. Another striking instance of the error of ignoring Indian evidence may be adduced. In a very interesting 1 Cultes, Mythes, et Beligions, i, 03-8. 2 Cf. Farnell, Cults of the Greek States, iv, 329 seqq.</page><page sequence="12">m. reinach's theory of sacrifice 553 study1 of the legend of the sufferings of Prometheus M. Reinach finds that in origin the eagle was a bird of prognostication which was attached firmly by impaling it or by some other similar means to the front of the temples of Greece?possibly at an earlier date to the front of any house?as is apparently the view of Miss Harrison,2 in order to avert evil influences and in special the lightning. This bird, the foreseeing, Pro metheus, was the prototype of the god Prometheus, the death of the bird being in complete harmony with the ritual slaying of a god either to eat the body as a sacra ment or to use the skin for a mascarade. When, however, influences from the north changed zoomorphism to anthropomorphism, Prometheus was deemed to be a man and the eagle came to be the power which tormented him, just as the boar which slew Adonis is originally the god himself. The connexion of the eagle with the theft of fire is due to the fact that the eagle flies highest of all birds and may justly be deemed to fetch the fire from the sky, while the difficulty of obtaining fire in early times and the frequent resort to theft to secure it explains why the action was regarded as a theft. This is a very captivating theory, and its chief defect lies in the incorrect view that zoomorphism is a thing in time before and different essentially from anthropo morphism. Hence M. Reinach insists that the eagle is tbe origin and object of worship for itself, and brings it more or less artificially for logical reasons into connexion with the lightning. But the obvious solution pointed to by the Vedic evidence is that the eagle is the lightning itself, and this fact explains at once the whole situation : if the eagle is considered to be the form of manifestation of the lightning, the use of the eagle on the temple front in order to avert lightning becomes at once in harmony with the general primitive views of man on magic. 1 Cultes, Mythes, et Religions, iv, 68-91. 2 See Reinach, iv, 91, n. 1.</page><page sequence="13">554 M. reinach's theory of sacrifice Moreover, the fact that the eagle brings down the lightning is at once explained, and it is not necessary to assume that an original eagle worship has been later on confused with a different form of religion. Where, in effect, M. Reinach sees zoolatry, there is no need to see more than theriomorphic conceptions of a divinity not in itself an animal at all, but the lightning. The reason why the lightning was thought of as in eagle form may well be due to the fact of the bird's lofty flight, but the essential point is that we have no reason in this case to see any worship of the bird per se: it is perfectly con ceivable that it was so worshipped, but it is clearly contrary to sound method to go beyond the facts which adequately explain the myth without any such assumption. A further point of doubt must lie in the view suggested first by Lang1 that the practice of human stealing of fire is the origin of the myth of the stealing from heaven : it is much simpler to suppose that, if the fire is in the sky, it was thought natural that its being brought down was a theft: the Indian idea is so expressed as to favour this view rather than the view taken by Lang. There remains still intact the view that the mode of punishment of Prometheus was suggested by the treatment of the eagle on Greek temples. The idea is ingenious, but it is not proved to be correct. All that can be gathered from the passage of Pindar (01. xiii, 20-2) which forms the starting-point of M. Reinach's conclusions is that the figure of an eagle was placed on the temple. For this we have a clear parallel in the solar disk with wings used in Egyptian temples : this usage is asserted by M. Reinach to be the result of syncretism between an eagle and the sun as protectors of the temple, but we are not required to accept this theory unless we hold his theory of the position of the eagle. It is much simpler to regard tbe symbol as the representation of the sun as an eagle, which 1 Modern Mythology, pp. 194 seqq.</page><page sequence="14">THE INDIAN DAY 555 is a parallel concept to the idea of the eagle as lightning. Early religion is theriomorphic in its conceptions as well as anthropomorphic : early religion is also sometimes given to out-and-out zoolatry, but not every divine animal was once actually worshipped 2?ev se. The exact origin of the fable of the punishment of Prometheus must therefore be left vague. It is clear, however, that the Vedic myth already * regards the action of the descent of fire in the form of lightning and the fall of rain there with as a species of theft, and the development of a myth like that of Prometheus is not very difficult.
