<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEAN ALFANGE, JR. CONGRESSIONAL REGULATION OF THE "STATES QUA STATES": FROM NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES TO EEOC V. WYOMING In EEOC v. Wyoming,' the Supreme Court upheld, by a vote of five to four, the constitutionality of the 1974 amendment2 to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967' extending the Act to employees of "a State or political subdivision of a State."' It thereby sustained the claim of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that, under the amended law, Wyoming was prohibited from conditioning the employment of its game and fish wardens after the age of fifty-five upon "the approval of the employer."' Commenting on this decision on the following day in the New York Times, Linda Greenhouse wrote that the Court had "effectively overruled, albeit not in so many words,"' its 1976 decision in National League of Cities v. Usery.' In that case, the Court had invalidated the 1974 amendment8 to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 19389 (ironically enacted together with the ADEA amendment upheld in the Wyoming case), extending the wage and hour provisions of the Act to employees Dean Alfange, Jr., is Professor of Political Science at the University of Massachusetts -Amherst.

Although it is clear that faithful adherence to the reasoning of Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion in National League of Cities would have led to the invalidation of the ADEA amendment (only one of the eight Justices who participated in the decision of both cases-Justice Blackmun-appeared to believe that the two cases should have been decided differently),'2 and although National League of Cities has had no progeny among Supreme Court decisions, it cannot be said to have been overruled by Wyoming. The dissenters in National League of Cities (who were four-fifths of the new majority) applied in Wyoming-and thereby legitimated-the approach to the issue of constitutionality set forth by Justice Rehnquist in the earlier case. The differences that were seen to require a different result were merely differences of fact. Thus, a minor reassessment of the factual situation in a subsequent case is all that is required to restore the vitality of the earlier decision. In Justice Jackson's phrase, National League of Cities still "lies about like a loaded weapon"" ready for use by a Court that is prepared to circumscribe congressional authority to satisfy its own conception of proper public policy.

It is not clear whether he saw the cases as distinguishable or whether he had simply changed his mind in the intervening seven years.

WYOMING 217 least of the bases for its critical reception was its startling break with established precedent. Since the end, in 1937, of the era in which the Court had employed restrictive definitions of the commerce clause and the doctrine of substantive due process to protect American business from state and federal regulation,"' the Court had not employed state autonomy to invalidate an act of Congress based on the commerce power." In United States v. California"' in 1936, the Court had unanimously rejected the contention that Congress could not, under that power, require a railroad owned and operated by a state to comply with the provisions of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.'9 The Court distinguished precedents holding that state instrumentalities were immune from federal taxation, declaring that "there is no such limitation upon the plenary power to regulate commerce. The state can no more deny the power if its exercise has been authorized by Congress than can an individual."20 This view remained good law for forty years,2' and the reasoning had been extended in 1946 to cover congressional regulation of state activity under the war power.2 In 1966, Congress for the first time extended the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act to include certain employees of state and local governments-those employed in hospitals, institutions, and schools.2 The constitutionality of this extension was upheld in Mary- Money, and State Sovereignty: The Judicial Role, 79 COLUM.

In an opinion by Justice Harlan, the Court stated that the controlling principle was that laid down in United States v. California: there could be no denial of the reach of "the commerce power to protect enterprises indistinguishable in their effect on commerce from private businesses, simply because those enterprises happen to be run by the States for the benefit of their citizens."2" Justice Douglas, joined by Justice Stewart, dissented, arguing that if Congress were as free to regulate the activities of states under the commerce power as it is to regulate individuals, "then the National Government could devour the essentials of state sovereignty."26 As late as 1975, in Fry v. United States," with only Justice Rehnquist in dissent, the Court relied on both Maryland v. Wirtz and United States v. California to uphold the application of the salary increase restrictions that had been authorized by the Economic Stabilization Act of 197028 to prevent the State of Ohio from awarding wage and salary increases to its employees larger than those that were permissible under the administrative regulations that had been promulgated to implement the provisions of the Act. The Court devoted scarcely any discussion to the constitutional question beyond noting that the State's position was "foreclosed" by Wirtz.29 Yet, only thirteen months later, four members of the majority in that case joined with Justice Rehnquist in National League of Cities to explain away the significance of Fry,"0 to declare the language of United States v. California, on which the subsequent line of cases had been based," to be "simply wrong,"32 and to overrule Maryland v. Wirtz." To accommodate its ruling with precedents it was not prepared to overrule and with federal law it was not prepared to invalidate, the Court in National League of Cities attempted to draw four distinctions, " 392 U.S. 183 (1968), overruled in National League of Cities v.

It was an augury of things to come that the majority opinion in Fry included an enigmatic footnote that stated that the Tenth Amendment "is not without significance," and that its meaning was "that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system." Id. at 547 n.7. It was quickly noted, however, that the Court was "convinced that the wage restriction regulations constituted no such drastic invasion of state sovereignty."

It sought to distinguish (1) between the scope of Congress's authority over the states under the commerce power and under other delegated powers; (2) between congressional regulation of private activities within a state and regulation of the activities of the State itself; (3) between traditional and nontraditional functions of state and local governments; and (4) between necessary, desirable, insubstantial, or benign effects on state autonomy and effects which are unnecessary, undesirable, significant, or harsh. A. THE COMMERCE POWER AND OTHER DELEGATED POWERS One of the principal difficulties with Justice Rehnquist's opinion is that he changes his argument in the midst of making it. He begins by conceding that the regulation of the wages and hours of state and local employees is "undoubtedly within the scope of the Commerce Clause,""4 but notes that, even so, "there are attributes of sovereignty attaching to every state government which may not be impaired by Congress, not because Congress may lack an affirmative grant of legislative authority to reach the matter, but because the Constitution prohibits it from exercising the authority in that manner.""'' To protect these "attributes of sovereignty"-the existence of which is reflected in the Tenth Amendment--Congress is forbidden to "exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system."" It may not directly regulate the "States qua States,"" by displacing their "freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.'"" The Tenth Amendment cannot, of course, by its terms place a limit on the exercise of a delegated power. It merely provides that "powers not delegated to the United States ... are reserved to the States," and, therefore, any aspect of a power which is delegated to the United States is not, by definition, reserved to the states." But that is not the heart of " Id. at 841. That this was not a grudging concession may be seen from Justice Rehnquist's dissenting opinion in Fry v. United States, 421 U.S. at 551, where he spoke of "the anachronistic and doctrinally unsound constructions of the Commerce Clause which had [prior to 1937] been used to deny both to the States and to Congress authority to regulate economic affairs." " 426 U.S. at 845. '6 Id. at 843, quoting from Fry v. United States, 421 U.S. at 547 n.7. See note 29 supra. 37 426 U.S. at 847. 38 Id. at 852. * It was on this basis that Justice Stone made his often quoted remark that the Tenth Amendment "states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered." United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 124 (1941).</page><page sequence="6">220 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1983 the problem here. Constitutional prohibitions may be implicit as well as expressly stated." The principal problem is that Justice Rehnquist ultimately does not rest his argument on the existence of a constitutional prohibition at all, whether drawn from the Tenth Amendment or from any other source. He concludes-in direct contradiction to his initial concession-that the statutory amendment was invalid, not because it violated a prohibition, but because it was "not within the authority granted Congress by [the Commerce Clause].''"" The logical dilemma Justice Rehnquist faced was that, as he constructed his argument, the invalidity of the law both had to be and could not be based on a constitutional prohibition. It had to be based on a prohibition, because-given his concession that the law was within the scope of the commerce power-it could not be unconstitutional unless it violated a prohibition. It could not be based on a prohibition, because the Court was not prepared to hold that Congress could not interfere with the states' "freedom to structure integral operations" through the use of delegated powers other than the commerce power. (In a footnote, the Court expressly reserved judgment on that question.)" But constitutional prohibitions cannot merely limit one power; they must apply equally to all. If Congress is in fact forbidden to interfere with "the States' freedom to structure integral operations," then it cannot do so under any of its powers. Conversely, if it can validly do so under one of its powers, then it cannot be constitutionally prohibited from doing so. Only four days after National League of Cities was issued, the Court confirmed the implications of its footnote in another opinion by Justice Rehnquist," when, without dissent, it accepted as beyond question that Congress was empowered under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to extend the prohibitions against employment discrimi- nation contained in ?703(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964" to states (or local governments) as employers"4-despite the fact ' See, e.g., McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 426 (1819), where Chief Justice Marshall found a prohibition against state taxation of federal instrumentalities in "a principle which so entirely pervades the constitution, is so intermixed with the materials which compose it, so interwoven with its web, so blended with its texture, as to be incapable of being separated from it, without rending it into shreds."

WYOMING 221 that this prohibition operated upon the "States qua States" and "displace[d] the States' freedom to structure integral operations" every bit as much as did the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act that had been invalidated for doing so a few days earlier. "There can be no doubt," Justice Rehnquist declared, that "Congress, acting under the Civil War Amendments, [may intrude] into the judicial, executive, and legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the States."" It can do so, he explained, because the authority granted by the enforcement clauses of those amendments is delegated expressly for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the prohibitory provisions, "which themselves embody significant limitations on state authori- ty."" Thus it can hardly be impermissible for Congress to restrict state autonomy in areas where that autonomy is already limited by the Constitution. Such a distinction might be valid if Congress's power under the Civil War Amendments were limited to providing sanctions or remedies to deal with acts of states that were, in themselves, prohibited by the Constitution." But Congress's power is not so limited, and, in fact, Justice Rehnquist relied on South Carolina v. Katzenbach," which upheld provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,50 whose encroachments on state sovereignty were about as sweeping as could be imagined. While the Voting Rights Act was a congressional response to the widespread practice of racial discrimination in voting," its principal provisions (which included disallowing literacy tests as a means of determining voter eligibility in states covered by the Act," authorizing the appointment of federal examiners to supplant state and local officials in carrying out the traditional state functions of determining voting qualifications and registering voters,53 and " 427 U.S. at 455, citing and quoting at length from Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 345-48 (1880), which had upheld a federal indictment against a state judge for excluding persons from service on state court juries "on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude" in violation of ?4 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, 18 Stat., Pt. 3, 336.

And in 1980, in City of Rome v. United States" and Fullilove v. Klutznick,56 the Court reaffirmed both that the reach of Congress's power under the Civil War Amendments extended to the regulation of state actions that were in themselves perfectly constitutional and that this enforcement power was not subject to the restrictions imposed on the commerce power in National League of Cities. But as long as the state policies being displaced by congressional action are ones that the Constitution leaves the states free to adopt, it can make no difference to the integrity or autonomy of the states whether Congress displaces those policies through the use of the commerce power or any other power. In either case, it is Congress, not the Constitution, that takes authority away from the states. It is of no relevance that the Civil War Amendments were intended to "embody significant limitations on state authority." 5 For it is certainly no less true that the Commerce Clause was also intended to limit state authority.5" The constitutional grant to Congress of authority over 54 79 Stat. 439; 42 U.S.C. ?1973c. South Carolina v. Katzenbach was unanimous except that Justice Black alone dissented on this single aspect of the case, insisting that the constitutional guarantees of federalism must "mean at least that the States have power to pass laws and amend their constitutions without first sending their officials hundreds of miles away to beg federal authorities to approve them." 383 U.S. at 359 (concurring and dissenting opinion).

See text at note 47 supra. ?8 See, e.g., CORWIN, THE COMMERCE POWER VERSUS STATES RIGHTS (1936). Professor Corwin observed that one of the "immediate objectives back of the commerce clause" was "to bring to an end either directly or through Congressional action, all State power in relation to both foreign and interstate commerce." Id. at 23. While there may be reason to doubt that the commerce clause itself took away all state power over interstate or foreign commerce, see Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court: State and Congressional Powers, 1801-1835, 49 U. CHI. L. REV. 887, 942-47 (1982), a view which has been rejected by the Supreme Court-see, e.g., Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299 (1851)-surely at the very least it invested Congress with full authority to remove from the states whatever power over interstate or foreign commerce they had previously possessed that Congress deemed incompatible with the national interest. Thus, if Professor Corwin meant that the commerce clause provided the potential, "either directly or through Congressional action," to end all state power over interstate and foreign commerce, he was unquestionably correct. For a review of the meager history of the adoption of the commerce</page><page sequence="9">6] NLC TO EEOC v. WYOMING 223 commerce is, at bottom, simply a power to displace state choices.59 The only other power mentioned by Justice Rehnquist, in his National League of Cities footnote,' by which Congress might possibly be able to "affect integral operations of state governments" in ways it could not validly accomplish under the Commerce Clause was the spending power-which, since 1937, has consistently been interpreted as empowering Congress to tell the states how to carry out particular governmental responsibilities, even in areas where it lacks direct regulatory authority."' Since the basic provisions of the Social Security Act of 193562 were upheld by the Supreme Court in Steward Machine Co. v. Davis6 and Helvering v. Davis," the ability of Congress to use the power to tax and spend to induce the states to maintain particular programs has become a prominent and broadly accepted feature of the federal system.6 The very purpose of imposing these conditions frequently is to require the states to make choices regarding their "integral operations" that they might otherwise be disinclined to make." But only in the quickly repudiated decision in United States v. clause, see Stern, That Commerce Which Concerns More States than One, 47 HARV. L. REV. 1335, 1337-48 (1934). " In his dissent in EEOC v. Wyoming, 103 S. Ct. at 1072-73, Chief Justice Burger suggested another reason for distinguishing the extent of the limits imposed by the principles of state autonomy embodied in the Tenth Amendment on the commerce power of Congress from the limits on its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment: the Tenth Amendment was adopted after the commerce clause and thus limits it; it was adopted before the Civil War Amendments and thus is limited by them.

An extremely informative summary may be found in Kaden, note 14 supra, at 871-81. 6 In recent years, scholarly commentators have expressed concern over the potential reach of Congress's power to require the states to do its bidding by the imposition of conditions on federal grants. A thorough and balanced analysis of the constitutional issues is in Stewart, Pyramids of Sacrifice? Problems of Federalism in Mandating State Implementation of National Environmental Policy, 86 YALE L. J. 1196, 1250-62 (1977).

"Things As They Are" and Fiscal Federalism, 50 FORDHAM L. REV. 130 (1981). But there is virtually unanimous agreement among commentators that, without more, there is no constitutional prohibition against constitutional grants merely because they displace state choices regarding the conduct of state business. See, e.g., Stewart, supra, at 1255.</page><page sequence="10">224 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1983 Butler" in 1936 has the Supreme Court held that state sovereignty limits the spending power. In rejecting Butler's conclusion that such use of the spending power was void because of its "coercive purpose and intent,""' the new majority of the following year (which included Justice Roberts, the author of Butler) held that the provisions of the Social Security Act were not, in fact, "weapons of coercion, destroying or impairing the autonomy of the states.""' "[T]emptation," the Court intimated, is not "equivalent to coercion."70 It is on this basis that courts have traditionally dismissed constitutional complaints that conditional grants impair state autonomy." Insofar as the assumption is correct, Congress does not displace, through the spending power, the states' freedom to act as they see fit. It merely encourages them successfully to exercise that freedom in different ways. An advantage of this assumption, of course, is that it avoids the problem of differentiating between Congress's capacity to interfere with state autonomy through the spending power and the commerce power. If the spending power does not interfere with state autonomy, then there is no need to explain why Congress has broader authority to interfere with the states here than under the commerce power. But the assumption is a transparent fiction. In the first place, as Richard Stewart has noted: "Debating whether conditions on federal grants ... 'coerce' the states is an unhelpful anthropomorphism. The structure of the federal system under current social and economic conditions makes it inevitable that states will become subject to the federal spending power, just as it makes it inevitable that they will become subject to the federal commerce power."72 Second, it is analytically not very useful to assert that Congress interferes with state autonomy when it achieves a modification of state policies through the commerce power, but that it does not interfere with state autonomy when it achieves the identical modification through the spending power. At the close of his dissent in National League of Cities, Justice Brennan pointed out that Congress could restore the wage and hour 6 297 U.S. 1 (1936). 68 Id. at 71. 6' Steward Machine Co. v.

WYOMING 225 requirements invalidated by the majority "by conditioning grants of federal funds upon compliance with federal minimum wage and overtime standards,"" and there is no reason to believe that the Court would not uphold congressional power if exercised in that manner. But surely the interference with state autonomy, or the degree of displacement of state choices, would be no greater in the one case than in the other. If, as the Court has consistently held, Congress may effectively control integral operations of state governments through the spending power, it can only be because no constitutional prohibition is involved. There would be no particular utility to canvassing each of the other delegated powers to demonstrate that, with the possible exception of the taxing power-which will be discussed later"-there is no basis for drawing a constitutional distinction between the degree to which Congress may interfere with state autonomy through them and through the power to regulate interstate commerce. Suffice it to say that although Justice Rehnquist only made express reference to the spending power and to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in suggesting, in his National League of Cities footnote, that there may be greater room for Congress to displace state choices under other powers than under the commerce power, the Court has made quite clear in other cases-including some contemporaneous with or subsequent to National League of Cities-that Congress is not limited by considera- tions of state autonomy when exercising a wide range of different powers.

THE REGULATION OF THE "STATES QUA STATES" The authority of Congress under the Commerce Clause to displace state policies regulating private activity has, since 1937, been held to be virtually without limit as long as there is "a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of com- merce."76 On this basis, the power of Congress to control the wages and hours of those who work for private employers is as settled as any proposition of constitutional law can be." Justice Rehnquist made no effort whatever to deny Congress's plenary authority in this regard,78 but declared that it was an entirely different matter "to uphold a similar exercise of congressional authority directed, not to private citizens, but to the States as States."9" The perceived difference was that, apparently unlike congressional regulation of private activity, the control of what state and local governments pay to their employees-or at least those of their employees engaged in "traditional governmental functions"- powers, express or implied, delegated to the national government.' " 327 U.S. at 102, quoting from Fernandez v. Wiener, 326 U.S. 340, 362 (1945). With regard to the power under Art. IV, sec. 3, to make rules respecting federal property, the Court has held that the exercise by Congress of its "power over the public land ... is without limitations" and may constitutionally be employed to displace the choices of a state and a municipal government as to how water and electrical energy obtained from public lands "shall be disposed of in San Francisco"- that is, whether it should be made available to consumers through public or private agencies. United States v. San Francisco, 310 U.S. 16, 28, 29 (1940). See also Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529 (1976), and the cases cited therein, id. at 539. 7' Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 304 (1964). 7 As originally enacted, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, note 9 supra, controlled only the wages and hours of employees "engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce." 52 Stat. 1062. A unanimous Court upheld this law in United States v. Darby, note 39 supra, in part on the ground that it was rationally related to the regulation of interstate commerce. But since the test of the scope of this power is that Congress may act when it has "a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce," see text at note 76 supra, Congress had authority under the commerce power to regulate the wages and hours of a much broader category of employees. In 1961, Congress extended coverage of the Act to all employees of an "enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce," whether or not they themselves were engaged in these activities. 75 Stat. 66; 29 U.S.C. ?203(s). Since there was a reasonable basis for believing that the total labor costs of such an enterprise would affect interstate commerce, the extension was upheld. Maryland v. Wirtz, note 24 supra, at 188-93. But even as thus extended, the Act covered a much narrower category of employees than was constitutionally required. Congress may reach the wages and hours of all employees, no matter how local or far removed from commerce their employment may be. That was the net effect of the 1966 and 1974 amendments, which extended the coverage of the Act to employees of enterprises in which persons are engaged in "handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person." 80 Stat. 831, 88 Stat. 59. Since there is scarcely any employee who does not work in an organization in which someone handles "materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person," and since the working conditions of such persons are rationally related to interstate commerce in those materials, Congress is constitutionally empowered to control the wage and hour levels of all of these employees.

Some of these "attributes of sovereignty" find express protection in the Constitution: for example, Article IV, section 3, guarantees each state sovereignty over its territorial integrity by providing that no new state shall be created by carving territory from an existing state or group of states without the consent of the states concerned; Article V provides that the Constitution shall not be amended to eliminate the guarantee that a state may not be deprived of equal representation in the Senate without its consent; the Eleventh Amendment protects states from being sued in federal court by citizens of other states or citizens of foreign countries.83 Other sovereign attributes may exist even though not expressly mentioned in the Constitution." The power to tax, the power to legislate with regard to activities not subject to federal regulation, and the power to determine both the form and structure of the state government and the terms of office of state officials would be in this category." The states' very existence has absolute constitutional protection: Congress "could not abolish the states on the grounds that they adversely affect interstate commerce."86 Other attributes of sovereignty may have absolute protection at a general, but not at a particular, level against 8 Ibid.

It may, however, through its delegated powers, including the commerce power, prohibit many possible exertions of a state's taxing power.8 Some attributes may appear to be absolute, such as the power to decide on the location of the state capital or on the terms of office of state officials, but the appearance of absoluteness probably rests more on the difficulty of imagining a legitimate reason for congressional interference than with the existence of an unyielding constitutional prohibition against interference if a legitimate reason were to be found. Justice Brennan was undoubtedly correct in his National League of Cities dissent when he declared that the Court's power to protect state sovereignty from destruction by Congress is to be found in its ability to invalidate laws that are not legitimately within the scope of the delegated powers." When Congress has been found to have a legitimate reason within the scope of its delegated powers to act, it may intrude even so far into the attributes of state sovereignty as to require a state or local government to obtain federal authorization prior to amending its election laws.89 The power to determine the wages and hours of its employees may be an attribute of state sovereignty, but there appears to be little reason for treating it as more immune from congressional control than a state's tax structure or its election machinery. More to the point, there is little reason for treating it as more immune from congressional control than a state's power to make policy judgments regarding the conditions of employment of private employees within its jurisdiction and to embody those judgments in legislation. As Justice Brennan stated, "the paradigm of sovereign action-action qua State-is in the enactment and enforcement of state laws. . . . [T]he ouster of state laws obviously curtails or prohibits the States' prerogatives to make policy choices respecting subjects clearly of greater significance to the 'State qua State' than the minimum wage paid to state employees.""

The majority opinion in National League of Cities makes little effort to explain why the power to set the wages of its own employees is more essential to a state's sovereignty than its power to control the wages paid by private employers. It merely asserts that, without such authority, "there would be little left of the States' '"separate and independent existence.'" ' 93 But such an assertion could be at least as easily made with respect to the authority of the state to regulate its internal economy, and no analysis supporting a coherent distinction is provided.

For an interesting development in another area of constitutional law in which the Court has distinguished "the state in its guise of active agent having particular interests opposed to other particular interests"-in this case the state as market participant rather than as market regulator with regard to transactions in interstate commerce-and has granted the state greater freedom in its role as "active agent" rather than as lawmaker, see White v.

But the state's inability to control the wages and hours of employees in the private sector makes it impossible for the state to compete for private business by lowering standards, and thus it may lose tax revenues and the quality or quantity of governmental services it can provide may be correspondingly circumscribed. Ultimately, the Court did not in fact assess the financial impact on the states of the federal wage and hour requirements, because it held that that question was immaterial. Regardless of the amount of strain involved, the federal standards "will nonetheless significantly alter or displace the States' abilities to structure employer-employee relation- ships" with regard to the provision of traditional governmental services95-that is, they will reduce or eliminate altogether the freedom of a state to provide these services through such means as the use of volunteer assistance, specially designed hours for special areas such as the police or fire departments,"96 the summertime use of teenage help, or the employment of persons "who for some ... reason do not possess minimum employment requirements, and [who thus may be paid] less than the federally prescribed minimum wage."97 Obviously, these requirements would affect state and local governments and could easily require them to restructure their delivery of essential services, but to say that they would leave the states without a "separate and independent existence" or that they would "impair[ ] the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system" is unwarranted hyperbole.

"1'0 But to suggest that such destruction is a risk of enforcement of the federal standards with regard to state and local employees is wholly unreasonable."'02 National League of Cities was not a case in which a state was being required to relocate its capital or to change the term of office of its governor. It was not even a case in which a state was being required to provide a service or to discontinue a service or to increase or decrease the level of service it chose to provide. Moreover, since the Court treats the actual financial impact on the states as immaterial, its rule would apparently apply even where that impact was minimal and necessitated no diminution of governmental services whatever.'03 Wage and hour standards do not implicate the issue that has, within the past decade, aroused considerable concern among constitutional scholars--whether the federal government has constitutional authority to "commandeer" agencies of state government to implement and enforce federal policies of which the states may not approve.'"

Perhaps a constitutional prohibition against "commandeer- ing" could be fashioned that would have general application and would not simply provide an ad hoc basis for invalidating a congressional policy disliked by the courts."'1 However, the wage and hour requirements merely call upon the states to comply with federal law; they do not call upon them to develop, promulgate, or implement a regulatory program mandated by the federal government to be enforced through state governmental machinery, or to create a state agency to carry out such functions. Lewis Kaden, who strongly believes that the "commandeering" by Congress of state governmental machinery is unconstitutional, nevertheless sees the issue in National League of Cities as fundamentally different: "Neither the fiscal nor the governmental impact of fair labor standards . . . significantly alters a state's political process.""' Inasmuch as such standards do not involve federal control of "the performance of a uniquely sovereign power: the "" Any such rule would have to take into account the fact that some congressional "commandeering" of state governmental agencies has already been upheld. See Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386 (1947). Those who would treat Testa v. Katt as not dispositive of the "commandeering" question argue that state courts, by the express provision of Art. VI, sec. 2, have the constitutional obligation to consider themselves bound by federal law, an obligation which is not imposed on state administrative agencies or other branches of state government, and that, in any event, the state courts, under Testa, were not required to assume jurisdiction that was not granted them under state law, but were merely required to enforce the terms of federal law when that was invoked in a case in which the state courts had jurisdiction under state law. See id. at 394. For statements of this argument, see, e.g., La Pierre, note 14 supra, at 944-45; Stewart, note 66 supra, at 1246-47; Dorsen, note 104 supra, at 53-55; and the dissenting opinions of Justices Powell and O'Connor in FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. at 773-74 n.4, 784-85. The fact remains that Testa v. Katt stands for the proposition that at least one state agency-the state courts-may, when properly vested with jurisdiction, be required by Congress to enforce provisions of federal law of which the state may not approve. See the discussion in FERC v. Mississippi, id. at 758-63. As for the requirement that the state authorities specifically consider the adoption of certain conservation measures, the Court resolved this issue without "mak[ing] a definitive choice between competing views of federal power to compel state regulatory activity."

Ibid. The Court specifically repudiated the "rigid and isolated statement" in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 107 (1861), that Congress "has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it."

If, as Justice Rehnquist maintains, the constitutional problem arises when congressional action affects the "States qua States," the case against constitutionality should be at its weakest when only a state's salary schedule, and not its capacity to govern, is at stake. C. TRADITIONAL AND NONTRADITIONAL GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS Perhaps the most widely criticized of the artificial distinctions in Justice Rehnquist's opinion was the line he drew between the "traditional governmental functions" of states and municipalities and their other functions.'0? To begin with, by conceding that the federal government has plenary power under the Commerce Clause "over areas of private endeavor, even when its exercise may pre-empt express state-law determinations contrary to the result which has commended itself to the collective wisdom of Congress,"'" the Court has not only allowed congressional regulation that "displaces state policies""0 in the area most central to the core interests of the "States qua States," but it has also authorized sweeping interference with the most traditional governmental function of all: governing. Probably the most severe of the anomalies of National League of Cities is its persistent equation of state sovereignty not with the ability to govern but with the ability to provide services."' But even if one dismisses that anomaly and focuses on the notion of "traditional governmental functions" exclusively in terms of the provision of services, it is difficult to understand how a distinction drawn by a federal court between what could be described as nontraditional services (subject to federal control) and traditional services (not subject to federal control) would not itself make severe inroads into a state's "sovereign prerogative of choice."2 For, as Frank 1'o Id. at 891.

Not only is the distinction between traditional and nontraditional functions extremely difficult to define and to apply in concrete instances,"4 but any attempt to define it by reference to past practice would tend to freeze constitutional law into a static, historically determined pattern,"' and, as Felix Frankfurter put it: "Such a static concept of government denies its essential nature.""' On the other hand, if "traditional" is redefined to mean "important" or "essential,'"' the concept becomes boundless. Surely there is no better standard for measuring what is an important or essential service than observing what the legislature, within the limited scope of its resources, has decided to provide. One of the routine justifications for respecting state autonomy is the classic argument of Justice Brandeis in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann"" (dissenting from a decision that state regulation of the ice industry was novel and not sufficiently important to the public interest to be constitutionally justified): "It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.".'. If by traditional governmental functions the Court meant what it said, then it both affirmed the virtues of state sovereignty and-by limiting the states' freedom from federal control in the provision of services to those services that are time-tested and nonexperimental-curtailed one of the principal reasons for recognizing that sovereignty: the preservation of the states' ability to experiment that Justice Brandeis extolled.'20 "' Michelman, note 92 supra, at 1172.

In the course of invalidating the wage and hour standards for state and local employees performing "traditional governmental functions," it specifically reaffirmed the result, if not the reasoning, of United States v. California,'2' in which congressional regulation of a state-owned railroad had been upheld. And, six years later, it reiterated this position by defining "traditional" purely in static, historical terms to uphold federal regulation of a state-owned commuter railroad on the ground that running a railroad is a nontraditional governmental activity,122 thus entirely ignoring the importance of providing commuter transporta- tion in urban areas. Such precedential basis as the Court had for its distinction between traditional and nontraditional governmental functions was derived from the area of intergovernmental tax immunity-not one of the most admired doctrines of American constitutional history. Tax immunity was granted the states as an indirect means of ensuring that state governments could not be "crippled, much less defeated" by the federal taxing power.23 But, in South Carolina v. United States24 in 1905, the Court refused to grant a state immunity from federal liquor license taxes when it took over from private dealers the business of selling liquor. Business enterprises of the state were not to be accorded the same degree of constitutional protection as the states' traditional functions, and states were not given the ability to immunize activities within the legitimate scope of the federal taxing power from the reach of that power by the expedient of taking them over.'25 But neither the justification for granting the states immunity from federal taxation nor the justification for distinguishing in this area between traditional and nontraditional functions of states has any application to areas in which Congress is exercising regulatory authority. The taxing power of Congress is more difficult to cabin than its 121 297 U.S. 175 (1936). See text at notes 18-21 supra. ,22 United Transportation Union v.

The distinction between traditional and nontraditional functions of government for the purpose of determining the scope of state immunity from federal taxation was continued-see Ohio v.

New York v. United States, 326 U.S. 572 (1946) (sale of mineral waters)-but was ultimately described by the Court as "unworkable," Case v.

Justice Brennan noted in his National League of Cities dissent that the Court could effectively protect the states from destruction through the commerce power by limiting congressional exercise of that power to enactments that have a legitimate relation to commerce.26 But the taxing power is not susceptible to that kind of control.'27 Congress is free to choose the subjects it wishes to tax virtually without direct constitutional limitation. The immunity doctrine thus serves as an artificial means of ensuring that Congress will no more be able to destroy the states through taxation than through regulation. Although the relevant constitutional prohibition on the taxing power of Congress is no different from that which applies to all the delegated powers-that is, Congress may not, under any of its powers, strip the states of the ability to carry out any function essential to their continued existence-the special guarantee of tax immunity was provided to preclude any possibility of the circumven- tion of that prohibition through the instrument of taxation. Since the distinction between the traditional and nontraditional functions of government was established in the tax immunity area to avoid the adverse effects on federal power of granting unnecessarily broad immunity to the states, there is no reason to invoke it in an area where immunity does not exist to begin with. Moreover, inasmuch as it was created, not for the purpose of imposing a limitation on the power of Congress, but to lessen the restrictiveness of a limitation already established, its importation into National League of Cities to impose a limitation on the commerce power is particularly inappropriate. When Congress restricts the freedom of the states through a regulatory power, the constitutional questions to be asked are whether Congress can reasonably be said to have acted within the scope of the power invoked and whether the particular exercise of that power genuinely threatens the "separate and independent" existence of the states. These inquiries require no distinction to be made between traditional and nontraditional governmental functions. "" 426 U.S. at 860 (dissenting opinion). See text at note 88 supra. "' As Justice Brennan has described it, the granting of intergovernmental tax immunity "reflected the view that the awesomeness of the taxing power required a flat and absolute prohibition against a tax implicating an essential state function because the ability of the federal courts to determine whether particular revenue measures would or would not destroy such an essential function was to be doubted."

The legacy of Fry. In his brief but elegant dissent in National League of Cities,28 Justice Stevens declared that he personally disagreed with the policy underlying the federal minimum-wage requirement but that his disagreement "merely reflects my views on a policy issue which has been firmly resolved by the branches of government having power to decide such questions."'29 He concluded: "Since I am unable to identify a limitation on ... federal power that would not also invalidate federal regulation of state activities that I consider unquestionably permissible, I am persuaded that this statute is valid.""'' His assessment that the decision reflected no principle of constitutional law of general applicability, but merely the majority's dissatisfaction with the wisdom of the policy embodied in the statute, is widely shared."' Archibald Cox, for example, described the decision as one which "illustrates with unusual clarity the Burger Court's affinity for pragmatic and particularistic policymaking.""'32 The problem is, as Justice Stevens pointed out, that the Court articulated no rule in support of its decision that could not be shown to have been transgressed by similar exercises of congressional power affecting the states. If the argument is that Congress cannot impose regulations on the "States qua States," it is plain that Congress frequently does so in ways that are not seriously challenged and that affect the "States qua States" at least as centrally as the requirement that they pay a minimum wage to their employees."' Nor does the fact that the rule of National League of Cities applies only to "traditional" or "essential" governmental functions provide a principle capable of general application."'

In Fry v. United States,"" only one year prior to National League of Cities, the Court upheld Congress's use of the commerce power to impose limitations on the authority of state and local governments to offer salary increases to their employees. The absence of any general principle of decision in National League of Cities is most clearly apparent in the Court's attempt to distinguish rather than to overrule Fry. It identified four reasons for regarding the congressional imposition of salary increase limitations on the employees of state and local governments as valid under the commerce power while regarding the imposition of wage and hour limitations on these same employees as invalid. The reasons were that the anti-inflation salary freeze that had been upheld in Fry (1) dealt with "an extremely serious problem ... which only collective action by the National Government might forestall"; (2) was to be in effect for only "a very limited, specific period of time"; (3) "displaced no state choices as to how governmental operations should be structured"; and (4) "operated to reduce the pressures upon state budgets rather than increase them."' 3 Justice Rehnquist declared: "The limits imposed upon the commerce power when Congress seeks to apply it to the States are not so inflexible as to preclude temporary enactments tailored to combat a national emergency.""'

WYOMING 239 correct to say, as the Court did, that congressional displacement of "the States' freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions" is outside the scope of the commerce power.'41 The statement must be rewritten: Congress may not displace the states' freedom in this area under the commerce power unless it really needs to do so and promises to cease doing so when the need is over. Moreover, it has greater power to do so when it seeks to prevent the states from amending their previous decisions (as opposed to making new decisions for them) and when it seeks to prevent them from being overly munificent as opposed to overly parsimonious.42 Each of the four asserted grounds for distinguishing Fry is manifestly untenable. The questions how badly legislation is needed and whether it is important that it be applied to the states are preeminently legislative. If Congress perceives a need and acts on that perception, the Court would not be performing a judicial function in substituting its judgment for that of Congress.43 And if Congress can determine the existence of the need, it must also be able to determine how long the need continues. Although Congress authorized the imposition of the wage freeze upheld in Fry for a period of limited duration,'" that fact cannot seriously be taken to have a bearing on the constitutionality of its action. Surely, the Court could not have been suggesting that a congressional effort to renew the restriction beyond the time of its expiration would have been of dubious constitutionality. And suppose Congress were to have decided that the continuing threat of inflation was so serious that a permanent system of wage controls needed to be instituted. Whatever might be said of the merits of such a conclusion, it could scarcely be argued that Congress's constitutional authority to maintain such controls would lapse after a period of six months or a year-perhaps to be revived once more after a passage of time. The contention that the salary increase limitations upheld in Fry 141 Id. at 852. 142 See Barber, note 14 supra, at 180-81, for a similar attempt to derive a constitutional rule from the National League of Cities opinion.

'W The classic statement of Chief Justice Marshall is directly in point: "But where the law is not prohibited, and is really calculated to effect any of the objects entrusted to the government, to undertake here to inquire into the degree of its necessity, would be to pass the line which circumscribes the judicial department, and to tread on legislative ground."

If a state believes that a choice that it had previously made has become obsolete and needs to be modified, denying it the capacity to make that modification is no less a displacement of the state's power of choice than the imposition on it of a federally determined salary scale."' As Justice Brennan forcefully pointed out: "It is absurd to suggest that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between curbs against increasing wages and curbs against paying wages lower than the federal minimum."'" In any event, it is particularly difficult to see how, if the Court could claim to see a distinction of constitutional dimension between acts of Congress that reduce the strain on state budgets and those that increase them, it could have arrived at its decision in National League of Cities without resolving the question whether the wage and hour restrictions there actually increased significantly the strains on the budgets of the governments involved."' In short, the only visible basis for a distinction between National League of Cities and Fry is that in the former case the Court did not believe that the need for federally mandated labor standards was sufficiently great, as a matter of policy, to justify imposing them on state and local governments. That the Court was, in reality, employing a "balancing of interests"-or, more accurately, a "balancing of policy considerations"-approach was made even clearer by the express recognition of that fact in Justice Blackmun's one-paragraph concurring opinion. Justice Blackmun joined the opinion of the Court, thus making it a majority rather than a plurality opinion,'8 but stated that he did not believe that the balancing approach that he saw the Court as adopting would "outlaw federal power in areas such as environmental protection, where the federal interest is demonstrably greater and where state facility compliance with imposed federal standards would be essential."'"

But, as Mark Tushnet has noted, Justice Blackmun "did not demonstrate why" the federal interest in environmental protection is greater than the</page><page sequence="27">6] NLC TO EEOC v. WYOMING 241 interest in imposing wage and hour requirements on the states as less great, he was prepared to deny Congress authority to require the states to meet these standards even though it would have power under the Commerce Clause, in other areas, to displace state choices with regard to the structuring of "integral operations" of their affairs. That surely is also the Court's position-no other explanation makes sense -but the Court would have greatly added to the coherency of its opinion if it had openly followed a balancing approach rather than to pretend to state a general constitutional rule and to hide its use of balancing by avoiding discussion of the factors that would have to have been balanced.'s0 What is the justification for balancing interests in this area-that is, for making the judgment of constitutionality turn on the Court's assessment of the wisdom, desirability, or necessity of the policy embodied in the challenged law? Since no question of individual rights is at stake here,"' this would appear to be a proper case for the judicial self-restraint endorsed by the Court since 1937 in the area of economic regulation.'52 This is not to quarrel with Charles Black's observation that, "as a matter of constitutional law, one must conclude that some limits on federal power arise by mere implication from the fact of there being states, with general authority over their own local concerns.'5"" Rather, if the "limits on federal power [that] arise ... from the fact of there being states" are to be judicially enforced, it should be through the articulation of rules or principles of general applicability-designed to ensure the continued existence of the states and to protect their powers to maintain a government, to legislate, to lay and collect taxes, to decide on their own "internal processes of decision making"'54 and perhaps also their right not to have their governmental agencies federal interest in maintaining adequate labor standards, nor did he explain what "such a demonstration would look like." Tushnet, note 14 supra, at 1341. 0O For one thing, if the Court had conceded that it was employing a balancing approach, it would have had to enter into an examination of one point to which no attention was paid in its opinion: the actual importance to the attainment of essential national goals of the application to state and local governments of federally designated labor standards. The significance of denying to Congress any power to control the wages of a sizable number of state and local employees, who, in total, constitute some 12 percent of the national civilian work force (13,103,000 out of a total civilian work force in 1981 of 108,670,000, STATISTICAL ABSTRACT OF THE UNITED STATES, 1982-83, at 303, 379), is probably not trivial, but the Court's opinion gives no consideration whatever to that side of the balance. "' Notwithstanding the ingenious arguments of Professors Michelman and Tribe. See note 92 supra. '2 See generally JACKSON, note 16 supra.

It should not be through a process of balancing that allows judges free rein to approve one act of Congress as constitutional, even though it restricts the autonomy of the states, and to disapprove another, whose impact on the states is no different from that of the first, because they do not happen to agree with Congress's judgment that the law is needed. To paraphrase Justice Stevens, if the Court cannot "identify a limitation on ... federal power that would not also invalidate federal regulation of state activities that [is] unquestionably permissible,"''l it should allow the congressional judgment to stand. 2. Political safeguards for the states. The classic statement of the proposition that the states are protected by political safeguards in the national political process was made by Herbert Wechsler."' Substantial changes in the structure and realities of that process- together with the vast expansion of federal programs in areas once left entirely to state control-have occurred in the thirty years since he wrote and have rendered much of his argument obsolete.'l Its ultimate conclusion, however, that the degree of permissible "[f]ederal intervention as against the states is ... primarily a matter for congressional determination in our system as it stands,"'I9 still is sound.'"? While it may no longer be possible to argue that state interests dominate the national political process, the critical point is not whether they are dominant but whether they can be assured a respectful and sympathetic hearing."' And, indeed, there is also no small degree of "' See note 105 supra and the discussion there in text. Another way to approach the problem of judicial enforcement of the constitutional "limits on federal power [that] arise ... from the fact of there being states" would be to inquire whether adequate political safeguards exist that would render Congress politically accountable for its actions and check possible irresponsible exertions of its authority.

In a footnote to his opinion in National League of Cities,"' Justice Rehnquist attempted to counter the argument that the courts should defer to Congress on such issues because, as Justice Brennan argued, "the States are fully able to protect their own interests in the premises."'6 If, Justice Rehnquist maintained, judicial protection should not be accorded to active participants in the governing process because their role provides them with adequate ability to protect themselves, then the Court should not have protected the President against invasions by Congress of his constitutional authority because Presidents have the capacity to protect their interests in the legislative process through the use of the veto.'65 This misses the point. The Court may provide protection for the constitutional authority of the President, just as it may provide protection for whatever degree of state autonomy is constitutionally guaranteed, but not by an ad hoc balancing of interests process through which it might conclude that the policy Congress sought to advance was not sufficiently important or desirable to justify an invasion of presidential (or state) authority that might be acceptable under other circumstances. To protect presidential or state authority, the Court should be prepared to rely on constitutional standards of general applicability. If such a standard can be articulated and defended, it may be applied in concrete cases without regard to the existence of the presidential veto power or the influence possessed by the states in the national political process.

For if the states can command a serious hearing for their concerns, it is not a proper judicial function to reassess the outcome of the legislative process to see whether it is desirable. It is not the Court's function to protect losers in the legislative process when the process has been fairly conducted. As long as the question is one of policy, the fact that the losers may be states ought not to change this."' A stronger argument in defense of judicial power to protect the constitutional essentials of state sovereignty was implicit in Justice Rehnquist's dissent in Fry. If, he suggested, Congress may impose on the states whatever restrictions it deems proper that are rationally related to its delegated powers, and if the Court may intervene only when the restrictions are so serious as actually to threaten "the continued existence of the state,""'" then it is possible that the degree of sovereignty to which the states are constitutionally entitled may be withdrawn, not by one dramatic act of the federal government, but by a succession of smaller actions each of which may seem innocuous enough on its face.169 As Robert Nagel has phrased it: "Discrete governmental restrictions do threaten these larger values cumulatively and in the long run.""' This concern is not without merit, but it would appear to apply equally to discrete instances of congressional action preempting state power to regulate private activity. It is no longer challenged that courts should defer to Congress in this regard, despite the fact that these actions cumulatively pose at least as great a threat to the preservation '" Whatever rule the Court may have thought it found was declared to be "not so inflexible as to preclude temporary enactments tailored to combat a national emergency." 426 U.S. at 853.

This very concern was consistently expressed by the Court in the pre-1937 period,'7' but was emphatically rejected afterward. Yet, despite the enormous increase in federal regulation of private activity that has taken place since the New Deal, and despite the dire predictions that the states would be destroyed if that were allowed to occur, the states remain effective actors in the American con- stitutional system. There is little reason to believe that the similar fear of the possible consequences of allowing Congress freedom from judicial supervision in the direct regulation of state activity is not equally exaggerated. On the basis of this fear, restrictions well within the scope of the delegated powers may be struck down, not because they appear to pose an immediate threat to the effective functioning of the states, but because if Congress may impose an innocuous regulation, it might subsequent- ly do other things which-individually or cumulatively-would pose such a threat. Robert Bork, arguing the federal government's case in National League of Cities as Solicitor General, was asked what the courts should do if Congress were to try to bankrupt the states by imposing on them a minimum wage of $50 an hour. His answer on reargument was correct: Congress would not do it.'2 As Justice Stone stated in his classic dissent in United States v. Butler, the occurrence of such a hypothetical example "would be possible only by action of a legislature lost to all sense of public responsibility.'""' As long as the states retain the degree of influence on the legislative process in Congress that they possess-that is, the ability to command a fair hearing on the effects that proposed legislation would have on them-they should not be any less able to convince Congress of the destructive impact of an accumulation of regulations than of the destructive impact of a single law. This is particularly true because, in arguing the case of cumulative impact, states would be presenting not merely conjecture about possible future results, but concrete evidence of what a succession of pieces of previous congressional legislation had already specifically done.

The dominant view at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, as reflected in the debates in the Constitutional Convention and the ratifying conventions,"' the Federalist Papers,'7 the language of the Supremacy Clause and the "Necessary and Proper" Clause, and the early opinions of the Supreme Court,"' was that the critical factor in determining the scope of national power should be national need, not conceptions of state sovereignty, and that the existence of national need should be determined by Congress, on whom the principal checks were to be the political safeguards of the constitutional system.78 Certainly this was the view that the Marshall Court embedded in the basic principles of American constitutional law-too deeply to be easily removed-in cases such as McCulloch v.

NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES AS PRECEDENT As a commentator recently noted: "In the six [now seven] years since NLC was decided, the Supreme Court has not addressed, much less resolved, the basic theoretical deficiencies of that decision."'82 At the same time, however, it has not again employed the doctrine to invalidate an act of Congress.'18 Between 1976 and 1980, the Court on three occasions confirmed the suggestion in its National League of Cities footnote'" that the limitations it found on the power of Congress "to affect integral operations of state government" did not apply when Congress was exercising power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment or section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment.'8 Within a week following National League of Cities, the Court, in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,'86 expressly recognized, without dissent, that when Congress acts under the Civil War Amendments, it may intrude into all areas of state autonomy, specifically including the structuring of the state's relations with its employees even in areas relating to the delivery of traditional governmental services.'8 In City of Rome v. United States,'88 the Court, citing Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, held that "[t]he decision in National League of Cities was based solely on an assessment of congressional power under the Commerce Clause,"'189 and that "principles of federalism that might otherwise be an obstacle to congressional authority are necessarily overridden by the power to enforce the Civil War Amendments... [because t]hose Amendments were specifically designed as an expansion of federal power and an '"' It certainly has no justification in the theory of the role of the courts in a democratic society that is espoused by Justice Rehnquist. See Rehnquist, The Notion of a Living Constitution, 54 TEXAS L.

Klutznick,' Chief Justice Burger, in a plurality opinion, wrote that "complications" that might arise when Congress uses "the Commerce Power to regulate the actions of state and local governments" may be avoided when it relies on "section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment for the power to regulate the procurement practices of state and local grantees of federal funds."'92 Also in 1980, the Court held that the sanctity of a state's legislative process is not immune to invasion by federal criminal law. In United States v. Gillock,'93 it held that evidence relating to the performance of official legislative activities could be introduced in the federal trial of a state legislator under an indictment charging various bribery and racketeering offenses. The Court held that the federal prosecution was a regulation of an individual, not of the state, and noted that it had been "recognized in National League of Cities that the regulation by Congress under the Commerce Clause of individuals is quite different from legislation which directly regulates the internal functions of States."'" The Court conceded that the prosecution of a legislator on the basis of his performance of official duties "might conceivably influence his conduct while in the legislature," but it said that this was "not in any sense analogous to the direct regulation imposed by the federal wage-fixing legislation in National League of Cities."'" Why it was not analogous was not explained. It is true that federal bribery and racketeering statutes do not directly control the legislative process of the state, but it is also true that the official acts of a state legislator are hardly an example of the "wholly private activity" that Congress had been conceded plenary power to regulate under the Commerce Clause, in contradistinction to its power to regulate state activity.96 If Congress regulates the official actions of state officials directly engaged in the conduct of a function no less traditional or integral than the operation of the state legislature, it is '90 Id. at 179.

Although the Chief Justice's opinion was written for a plurality rather than a majority (it was joined by Justices White and Powell), there is little doubt that this was the expression of a majority view, for the concurring Justices-Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun-could have no less broad a view than Chief Justice Burger as to the power of Congress to interfere with the "States qua States." 1' 445 U.S. 360 (1980).

Surely it is understandable that the Court would be unwilling to employ the doctrine of National League of Cities to place limits on the commerce power in the context of a bribery case, just as it is understandable that it would be unwilling to employ it in cases involving congressional efforts to eradicate discrimination under its power to enforce the Civil War Amendments. The very fact that the Court may be unwilling to extend a doctrine to analogous cases is itself evidence that the doctrine is of questionable validity. In 1981, in Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn.,'9 presumably in response to the difficulties some lower courts experienced with the inherent contradictions in the National League of Cities reasoning,'" the Court sought to codify what had been held there by creating a three-part test emphasizing its narrow applicability. "[I]n order to succeed," the Court declared, "a claim that congressional commerce power legislation is invalid under the reasoning of National League of Cities must satisfy each of the three requirements":200 First, there must be a showing that the challenged statute regulates the "States as States.". . . Second, the federal regulation must address matters that are indusputably "attribute[s] of state sovereignty."... And third, it must be apparent that the States' compliance with the federal law would directly impair their ability "to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions." "" Thus, Justice Frankfurter, whose view of the unrestricted breadth of congressional power to regulate state activity has not been exceeded by any member of the Court-see, e.g., his statement in Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York State Labor Relations Board, 330 U.S. 767, 780 (1947) (separate opinion): "Congress can, if it chooses, entirely displace the States to the full extent of the far-reaching Commerce Clause"-has declared that to assume "that Congress has constitutional power to limit the freedom of State legislators acting within their traditional sphere" "would be a big assumption." Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 376 (1951). In that case, Justice Frankfurter quoted from the statement in Coffin v. Coffin, 4 Mass. 1, 27 (1808), that the protection accorded to legislators against inquiry into their official actions is not granted to them as individuals "for their own benefit, but to support the rights of the people, by enabling their representatives to execute the functions of their office without fear of prosecutions, civil or criminal." Quoted in 341 U.S. at 373-74. None of this, of course, demonstrates that the result in United States v. Gillock, note 193 supra, was incorrect, but it certainly casts doubt on the Court's suggestion that the prosecution of a legislator for the manner in which official legislative acts were performed is merely an example of "the regulation .. .of individuals," id. at 371.

There are situations in which the nature of the federal interest advanced may be such that it justifies state submission. This codification had the unanimous support of the Court.202 It resolved some of the ambiguities in National League of Cities by confirming the suggestions in the opinion about its narrowness. It confirmed that it was only a limitation on the commerce power, that it had no application to congressional regulation of private activity, and that, even with regard to direct regulation of state activity, it could be overridden if the federal interest involved were great enough. But the codification did little to explain or justify the mystifying distinctions of National League of Cities; it merely restated them.20' It offered no elucidation of what "attribute[s] of state sovereignty" were protected against impairment by an exercise of the commerce power, and it failed to resolve the tension between what were now the first and second parts of the new test by explaining how it could provide a coherent definition of constitutionally protected attributes of state sovereignty that included only the activities of "States as States" and excluded the ability of the states to make the rules to govern private behavior. Nor did it make any effort to deal with the uncertainties created by such terms as "traditional governmental functions" or "integral opera- tions." The Virginia Surface Mining case and its companion, Hodel v. 2' Id. at 288 n.29. Citation of Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion in National League of Cities, 426 U.S. at 856, would seem to confirm that the balancing test put forward here was an acceptance of his argument of the need for balancing in this type of case. See text at notes 148-50 supra. 202 All Justices joined the Court's opinion except Justice Rehnquist, who concurred in the judgment but refrained from joining the majority solely because he wished to stress that the proper test for determining the scope of Congress's power over interstate commerce was whether the "regulated activity has a substantial effect on that commerce," not that it "merely 'affects' " it. 452 U.S. at 312 (concurring opinion). By expressly noting that he would otherwise have been prepared to join the majority, id. at 313, he left no doubt that he, too, was in agreement as to the Court's test. 20' Professor La Pierre's observation is sound: "Notwithstanding the superficial allure of an enumerated test, the Hodel three-prong test is an intellectual sham because it does not resolve the basic issues left unanswered in NLC."

WYOMING 251 Indiana,' dealt with various challenges to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977,205 which put into effect a national system for regulating surface coal mining and reclaiming the land after the mining activity ceases.2" As well as finding various provisions of the law constitutionally deficient on other grounds, federal district courts in Virginia20" and Indiana"0 had found it to contravene National League of Cities, because, although the regulatory provisions of the Act con- trolled the activities of coal mine operators, not states, they impaired the states' ability to make essential decisions regarding land use, which is one of the most important of their "traditional governmental functions."2" The Supreme Court unanimously rejected this argument because the law was not directed at the governmental operations of the "States as States," but at private activity, an area in which the states are subject to the total preemption of their laws with regard to any matter affecting interstate commerce.210 The Court declared: "[a]lthough such congressional enactments obviously curtail or prohibit the States' prerogatives to make legislative choices respecting subjects the States may consider important, the Supremacy Clause permits no other result."21' Nor did the Court find merit in the argument that the Act was invalid because it had a coercive effect upon the states, in that it allowed them to take over the regulation of surface mining and reclamation from the federal government-but only if they adopted a regulatory program that met standards spelled out in the act."'212 Because the states were not required to adopt a plan meeting federal standards, but were given the choice either to do so or to allow direct federal regulation of mining and reclamation activities, the Court felt that "there can be no suggestion that the Act commandeers the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program."213 In 1982, the Court rejected two additional challenges to congression- 204 452 U.S. 314 (1981). 20' 91 Stat. 445; 30 U.S.C. ??1201-1328. 2o See, e.g., Harvey, Paradise Regained?

Long Island Rail Road Co.,214 the Court unanimously and tersely reversed a Court of Appeals decision'21 that had held that, under National League of Cities, the provisions of the Railway Labor Act of 1926216 could not constitutionally supersede state labor relations law as applied to a state-owned commuter railroad. The lower court said that the provision of commuter transportation in a metropolitan area was "a very important public service," and thus an "integral governmental function,"21' and, on balance, the state's interest in the operation of its commuter railroad was greater than any countervailing federal interest under the Commerce Clause.218 The Supreme Court did not agree with these conclusions, both because it did not accept the contention that the operation of a railroad was a "traditional governmental function"-with the result that the third part of the Hodel test was not satisfied219--and because it did not see the federal interest involved as inferior to that of the state.220 On the question whether the operation of a commuter railroad was a traditional or integral governmental function, the Court fell back, to a large extent, on its gratuitous assertion in National League of Cities that the result in United States v. California22' (which had upheld federal regulation of a state-owned railroad) had been correct because the operation of a railroad was not an essential aspect of government activity.222 The Court concluded that since the operation of a railroad is not "among the functions traditionally performed by state and local governments,223 its regulation by Congress "simply does not impair a commentators who have expressed concern over the power of the federal government to require state governments to enforce federal law have distinguished between that situation and the situation presented by the Surface Mining Act, which gives the states the option either to implement and enforce federally mandated standards or to accept direct federal regulation, federally enforced. 30 U.S.C. ?1254(a).

Although the Court insisted that its emphasis on tradition "was not meant to impose a static historical view of state functions,'"225 it offered no response to the Court of Appeal's apparently unexceptionable observation that "there is now no reasoned basis for finding that the operation of an intrastate passenger service which transports tens of thousands to and from their jobs every day is any less a governmental function than are sanitation or public parks and recreation,"226 particularly where, as the Court of Appeals noted in this case, economic realities dictate that the service will be provided by the government or not provided at all.227 Aside from mere reliance on history, the only reasons adduced by the Supreme Court to support its conclusion were those that it had employed in South Carolina v. United States228 when it introduced the distinction between governmental and proprietary functions into the law of intergovernmental tax immunity:229 that a state should not be granted any encour- agement to engage in business ventures230 and that it should not be allowed to remove activities from the reach of federal power simply by taking them over.23 Strikingly, the Court totally ignored the unchallenged conclusion of the Court of Appeals that, in the light of the unprofitability of the line, the government here had no choice but to take it over. Thus, not only was this an essential governmental service, it was a service that could only be provided by the government.212 Unless the Court, contrary to its assertion, was merely imposing "a static historical view," it is difficult to see what its distinction between traditional (or essential) and other governmental functions 224 Ibid. 225 455 U.S. at 686. 226 634 F.2d at 27. 227 Id. at 26-27. 228 199 U.S. 437 (1905). 229 See text at notes 124-25 supra. 230 455 U.S. at 685 n.11, citing City of Lafayette v.

The Court's opinion in this case therefore serves to reduce this distinction, which is part of the very core of the National League of Cities approach, to utter vacuity. And its dispute with the Court of Appeals over whether the state interest in maintaining effective commuter service outweighs the federal interest in preserving an efficient national rail system demonstrates both the futility and the undesirability of resolving such issues by balancing interests in the courts.233 The second 1982 case, FERC v. Mississippi,234 involved a challenge to particular provisions of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978,235 in which Congress had sought to steer a middle course between national preemption of all state and local public utility regulation, in order to conserve energy resources, and the more constitutionally dubious approach of "commandeering" state and local agencies to implement and enforce federal conservation policies. What it did was spell out certain apparently desirable techniques for the conservation of energy and require state and local regulatory agencies to give full and formal consideration to adopting them.236 The Court noted that there was "a significant difference" between the issue in this case and that in National League of Cities, because the latter relates to "the extent to which state sovereignty shields the States from generally applicable federal regulations," while the former relates to "attempts to use state regulatory machinery to advance federal goals."237 Perhaps because it saw the issue as one "of first impression,"238 it did not invoke the Hodel test as a measure of the constitutionality of the Act. However, Justice O'Connor, who was joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist in dissent on this aspect of the case, had no doubt either that the Hodel test was the proper standard or that all three parts of the test had been met.239 Affirmance of the Act, she declared, " That this issue may be better left to congressional resolution is shown by Congress's amendment of the Railway Labor Act, while this case was pending before the Court, to provide special procedures for dealing with labor disputes involving publicly owned commuter railroads. 95 Stat. 681; 45 U.S.C. ?159a.

' For a more detailed explanation of the intricate statutory plan, see 456 U.S. at 746-50. One provision of the Act (Title II, ?210; 92 Stat. 3144; 16 U.S.C. ?824a-3) does require state regulatory agencies to implement federal policy with regard to encouraging use of nontraditional energy sources. See 456 U.S. at 750-51. The Court found the question of the constitutional validity of this requirement "more troublesome," id. at 759, but it upheld it on the reasoning of Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386 (1947). See the discussion in note 105 supra. 2 456 U.S. at 758, 759. 2 Id. at 759. 2I; Id. at 778-81 and n.7 (dissenting opinion). Justice O'Connor noted that Hodel had stipulated</page><page sequence="41">6] NLC TO EEOC v. WYOMING 255 "permits Congress to kidnap state utility commissions into the national regulatory family."24 The "commandeering" issue in Mississippi was distinct from that in Hodel,24 because in Hodel the states were given the option either to adopt an acceptable plan for the regulation of surface mining or to accept full federal preemption of their regulatory authority. In Mississippi, there was to be no federal preemption, and the states' choice was either to consider adoption of the measures that Congress required them to consider or to withdraw altogether from the field of public utility regulation. Although Justice O'Connor was obviously justified in declaring that the assumption that the states were left with any real choice was an "absurdity,"242 the Court relied both on the existence of an apparent choice and on the fact that the states were not being required to adopt regulations, but only to consider their adoption, to avoid "mak[ing] a definitive choice between competing views of federal power to compel state regulatory activity."243 It left for another day the question of the constitutionality of a congressional act that would require the states to adopt and enforce federally prescribed regulations and allow them no option except compliance. The decisive factors for the Court in this case were that Congress, under the Commerce Clause, had full authority to preempt the entire field of utility regulation, and that it was not actually compelling the states to adopt specific regulations. Because the challenged provisions of the act "simply condition continued state involvement in a pre-emptible area on the consideration of federal proposals, they do not threaten the States' 'separate and independent existence,'... and do not impair the ability of the States 'to function effectively in a federal system.' "2" that even if all three of the requirements of the test were satisfied, congressional authority might still be upheld if "the nature of the federal interest . . justifies state submission." 452 U.S. at 288 n.29. Although this would appear to have been an appropriate case for the invocation of this criterion in the light of the magnitude of the federal interest in energy conservation, Justice O'Connor sidestepped the issue, stating merely that "the Court has not yet explored the circumstances that might justify such an exception." 456 U.S. at 778 n.4. 240 Id. at 790. 241 See text at notes 212-13 supra. 242 456 U.S. at 781. See also, for a vigorous argument to the same effect, La Pierre, note 14 supra, at 945-47. 24' 456 U.S. at 764. The Court noted that there were precedents upholding federal authority to compel state officials and state governmental institutions to implement and enforce federal law. See note 105 supra. 244 Id. at 765-66. The argument that because Congress has unquestioned authority completely to preempt state regulation of private activity it may validly stop short of such preemption and simply require the states to enforce prescribed regulations has generally been found wanting. See Stewart, note 66 supra, at 1222-24; Dorsen, note 104 supra, at 46-49; and see Hearings, note 104 supra, at 497, 503, and passim.</page><page sequence="42">256 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1983 The cases following National League of Cities demonstrate rather starkly the central difficulty with that decision: the irrelevance of its categories and the emptiness of its reasoning make it impossible to derive from it any constitutional rules that can be applied coherently and evenhandedly in subsequent cases. If it is not overruled, it is likely to remain simply a sport in the law, as it is today, or, even worse, a precedent that may be employed from time to time without conceptual consistency but merely as a convenient device to allow judges to invalidate occasional acts of Congress with which they disagree. The interest putatively to be advanced by the National League of Cities doctrine is the preservation of the "States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system."245' However, in the light of the breadth and importance of congressional responsibilities relating to interstate commerce and the supremacy of Congress in the constitutional scheme, the integrity of state authority is inescapably compromised, and National League of Cities can, at best, provide only random and marginal protection. As summarized in Hodel, the doctrine has five limiting aspects, each of which helps to make it both incoherent and incapable of preserving the interests of the states: 1. It applies only to acts of Congress under the commerce power. However, there appears to be no understandable basis for such a limitation, and as Fitzpatrick, Rome, and Fullilove demonstrate, the most sweeping impairments of state autonomy can be accomplished by Congress through the enforcement powers granted it in the Civil War Amendments, as well as through enactments under such grants of authority as the spending power, the war power, or even the power to regulate foreign commerce,2' and National League of Cities does not affect these at all. 2. It applies only to congressional regulation of the "States qua States," but, as defined by the Court, this excludes both the states' power to govern and, as United States v. Gillock demonstrates, the performance of official duties by those officials on whom the "States qua States" must depend for their ability to carry out their most vital functions. 3. It applies only where the law affects a state's indisputable "attributes of sovereignty," but the attributes of sovereignty that are protected do not include the ability to make and enforce the laws and policies needed to govern individual and corporate behavior within the "' Fry v. United States, 421 U.S. at 547 n.7. 21 See note 75 supra.</page><page sequence="43">6] NLC TO EEOC v. WYOMING 257 state. Thus, the state can be stripped, as it was in Hodel, of complete authority to govern even with respect to a matter as central to legitimate local concern as land use, and, as in FERC v. Mississippi, its administrative officials may be denied authority to set their own agendas for carrying out their governmental responsibilities. 4. It applies only to protect the states in the performance of traditional or essential governmental functions, yet, apparently to preserve the bounds of this category, the states are denied the sovereign prerogative of determining what functions are essential for the welfare of their residents. This determination is to be made for them by the federal courts--apparently, if the approach taken in Long Island Rail Road is maintained, by reference to narrow historical considerations that exclude from the category of essential services the provision of public transportation in a metropolitan area. 5. Even if all the previous conditions are satisfied, congressional abridgment of state autonomy may still be upheld if the federal interest to be advanced is sufficiently great to warrant it. This judgment calls for a balancing process that will necessarily involve the courts, as in Long Island Rail Road, in the task--emphatically inappropriate to them-of assessing the magnitude of the federal interest in such matters as keeping national transportation systems free from obstructions caused by labor disputes, and comparing it with the state interest affected. These limitations are salutary in that they reduce the danger that considerations of state sovereignty may cripple the ability of the federal government to protect the national welfare. But, given the potentially massive restrictions on state sovereignty that they allow, and given the fact that state and local governments have substantial political resources to protect their interests in the legislative process in Congress, it seems both needless and quixotic for the Court to distort the Constitution, and devise a doctrine that defies rational analysis, merely to insure that Congress is denied power to impose on states and municipalities regulations pertaining to the employment of those responsible for carrying out their traditional governmental functions. Surely the "States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system" is not jeopardized more by such regulations than by the myriad other requirements that can be imposed on them by Congress and that are unquestionably constitutional.</page><page sequence="44">258 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1983 III. EEOC v. WYOMING A. THE MAIN PLOT In EEOC v.

With total ingenuousness, the four dissenters in National League of Cities, now joined by Justice Blackmun to compose a new majority,"' simply stated that the challenge to the 1974 amendment to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967,249 which extended the protection of the Act to employees of state and local governments, did not satisfy the third part of the Hodel test250 and dismissed it on that ground.25' The soundness of the entire constitutional exercise was not examined. Justice Brennan, writing for the majority, discussed at some length the legislative history of the ADEA to demonstrate that Congress and the executive had united, at the time of the initial passage of the Act, in the view that252 arbitrary age discrimination was profoundly harmful in at least two ways. First, it deprived the national economy of the productive labor of millions of individuals and imposed on the governmental treasury substantially increased costs in unemployment insurance and federal Social Security benefits. Second, it inflicted on individual workers the economic and psychological injury accompanying the loss of the opportunity to engage in productive and satisfying occupations.

The sole question raised was whether, "at least with respect to state game wardens, application of the ADEA to the States is precluded by virtue of external constraints imposed on Congress's commerce powers by the Tenth Amendment."255 The fact situation in Wyoming was more closely analogous to that in National League of Cities than that of any of the other cases that had come to the Court in the interim since 1976.256 The ADEA applied to the state as employer, rather than as legislator, administrator, or adjudicator, and the challenge thus fit that single, narrow category where state sovereignty appears to have constitutional significance under the National League of Cities doctrine. As the Court recognized, "[t]he management of state parks is clearly a traditional state function,257 so the pitfall that led to the dismissal of the constitutional challenge in Long Island Rail Road was avoided. One potential distinction, however, was that arguably the prohibition against age discrimination was an exercise of power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause,258 to which it had been clearly established that National League of Cities did not apply. However, the majority was content to set the Fourteenth Amendment aside and to treat the law as an exercise of the commerce power.259 The dissenters rejected the contention that it was sustainable as an exercise of power under the Fourteenth Amendment.2z With that concern removed, the case was on all fours with National League of Cities.

Smith26 ' against the use of the power to admit new states to prevent a state from relocating its capital as an example of the protection of such an attribute, and it asserted that the power to determine the wages and hours of "those whom they employ in order to carry out their governmental functions" was "undoubted[ly]" another such attribute.266 It determined whether a particular aspect of state autonomy was protected by asking whether it was among the "functions essential to separate and independent existence,"267 which, of course, is not a definition but merely the substitution of one phrase for another. In that same footnote, Justice Brennan did retreat significantly from his argument in National League of Cities that the only safeguard against federal impairment of state sovereignty that could be derived from the Tenth Amendment was the requirement that Congress not exercise power that was not delegated to it.268 He stated, however, that "some employment decisions are so clearly connected to the execution of underlying sovereign choices that they must be assimilated into them for purposes of the Tenth Amendment,"269 which plainly implies that some congressional actions squarely within the scope of the 261 426 U.S. at 847. 2(2 103 S.

Among these protected employ- ment decisions, he suggested, are those related to the "unimpeded exercise of State's role as provider of emergency services" and essential to the performance of its " 'dual functions of administering the public law and furnishing public services.' "2"0 But, he added, "not ... every state employment decision aimed simply at advancing a generalized interest in efficient management-even the efficient management of traditional state functions-should be considered to be an exercise of an 'undoubted attribute of state sovereignty,' "271 thus leaving the issue every bit as murky as before. In his dissenting opinion (in which he was joined by Justices Powell, Rehnquist, and O'Connor), Chief Justice Burger expressed no doubt that the 1974 amendment to the ADEA interfered with a constitution- ally protected attribute of state sovereignty. Given that the maintenance of state parks and the provision of recreation services are clearly traditional state functions, a state may "assure the physical preparedness" of those who are employed to assist in carrying out these functions.272 The Chief Justice suggested a quantitative test as a "persuasive" but not "conclusive" measure for determining whether a particular state action was entitled to constitutional protection as an attribute of sovereignty: one should look to see "whether other government entities have attempted to enact similar legislation."273 Since he found that most states have mandatory retirement laws that contravene the ADEA,274 and since Congress has excluded certain categories of federal employees (most notably, law enforcement personnel) from the coverage of the Act,275 he concluded that the requirements of this test were fully satisfied. But his judgment that the establishment of mandatory retirement laws was a protected attribute of sovereignty was more fundamentally based on the principle that "it 70 Ibid, quoting from National League of Cities, 426 U.S. at 851. Although the Michelman and Tribe articles are not cited, it is difficult to escape the thought, in the light of the Court's particular emphasis here on the constitutional dimension of the states' ability to provide basic public services in an "unimpeded" fashion, that it had been influenced by their arguments that the Constitution should be read as denying Congress authority unduly to interfere with the states' ability to meet their residents' constitutional rights to the provision of such services.

The problem is that it is not capable of general application. At best it applies only to those parts of the state government engaged in performance of traditional governmental functions, for it is not the Constitution but the Railway Labor Act that, by denying an employer the right to discharge an employee for labor union activity,277 limits the state's capacity to determine who is to be part of that agency of government responsible for commuter rail transit services, a limitation upheld in Long Island Rail Road by a unanimous Court in an opinion by Chief Justice Burger.278 It is also inconsistent with the opinion of the Chief Justice in Fullilove v. Klutznick,279 which affirmed the requirement of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 that at least 10 percent of federal grant funds awarded to states and local governments for public works projects be used to purchase goods and services from minority business enterprises. Surely it should be no less an attribute of state sovereignty to determine who shall be awarded a state contract than to determine who is to be given state employment, and clearly the Constitution does not require observance of the 10 percent set-aside requirement, but the Chief Justice saw no objection to Congress's displacement of the states' choices in this regard.280 To be sure, the 10 percent requirement was sustained in part as an exercise of congressional power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than the Commerce Clause. But that makes it no less clear that no rule of constitutional law prohibits Congress from interfering with a state's "power to choose-subject only to constitutional limits-who is to be part of the state government.' 2?" 103 S.

WYOMING 263 It was the third part of the Hodel test-whether "the States' compliance with the federal law would directly impair their ability 'to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions' "-that the Court used as its basis for rejecting the challenge to the constitutionality of the ADEA. Although the majority in National League of Cities had examined at some length the claims of states and local governments regarding the damaging financial impact of the Fair Labor Standards Act, it did not rely on those claims in concluding that the Act was unconstitutional because of its interference with structuring integral operations of those govern- ments.282 The mere displacement of state choices in this area was enough. Nevertheless, Justice Brennan based his opinion with regard to this part of the Hodel test squarely on an assessment of the actual impact the ADEA would be likely to have on the states,"' and on the conclusion that the impact would be "sufficiently less serious than it was in National League of Cities" to justify a different result.2~ The conclusion that the likely impact of the ADEA on the states was insufficient "to turn the color of legal litmus paper''285 was based not on "particularized assessments'"" but on a general discussion of what the nature of the impact could be expected to be on any state whose mandatory retirement laws were overridden. Justice Brennan offered three reasons for the Court's judgment. (1) If the state's concern is with the physical preparedness of its game wardens, the Act does not preclude it from attaining that goal both because it permits the state to require wardens to undergo periodic physical examinations (and to retire those who are not sufficiently fit) and because it allows exceptions to its provisions where it can be shown that age is a "bona fide occupational qualification" for a particular job.287 (2) The finan- cial pressures on state budgets resulting from observance of the ADEA 282 426 U.S. at 852.

Justice Brennan's assertion that the decision in National League of Cities was also dependent upon "considerations of degree," ibid., is simply untrue, at least as far as it relates to the majority opinion. Justice Blackmun, who provided the fifth vote necessary to make Justice Rehnquist's opinion in National League of Cities a majority opinion, clearly had "considerations of degree" in mind, as his concurring opinion-426 U.S. at 856-shows, but the majority specifically disclaimed reliance on any assessment of the degree of impact on the states.

Whatever strain may be imposed on a state's pension system by allowing workers to accrue more seniority (and thus earn larger benefits) and on its salary budget by requiring the retention of more senior (and thus more highly paid) employees, should be offset, at least in large part, by the fact that as long as the senior employees remain on the payroll they will not be drawing any pension benefits at all; when they do retire, they will be drawing from the pension fund for a smaller number of years.288 The increase in costs for health insurance or similar benefits that would result from the requirement that older employees be retained need not be great, because the Act allows adjustments in the benefit packages for these employees that could preclude a major increase.289 (3) Unlike the wage and hour requirements, which might prevent a state from accomplish- ing certain broader social purposes (the Court cited as its example the possibility mentioned in National League of Cities of providing jobs to untrained persons),2" the prohibition against mandatory retirement does not appear to pose a barrier to the attainment of any broader social goals.29' Chief Justice Burger viewed the likely impact on the states quite differently. He saw the strains on the state pension systems and salary budgets brought about by the elimination of mandatory early retirements to be significant,292 and the "[n]on-economic hardships ... equally severe."293 Because older game wardens must be retained in service, the state is "prevented from hiring those physically best able to do the job,"294' and the state is prevented from attaining important broader social goals such as providing incentives to the young and meeting affirmative action goals.295 He found that the exceptions to the ADEA in other federal statutes for various categories of federal employees296 demonstrated Congress's awareness of the desirability of requiring early retirement in certain areas of government employment and illustrated the absence of a valid purpose in "forcing the states to 2S Id. at 1063. 289 Ibid. 2o0 Id. at 1064, citing 426 U.S. at 848.

The majority and the dissenters were equally far apart in their judgments relative to the additional, "balancing of interests," segment of the Hodel test. Justice Brennan felt it unnecessary to address the 297 103 S. Ct. at 1071 (dissenting opinion). The Court refused to treat the exceptions to the ADEA provided by law for certain categories of federal employees as undermining the validity of the federal interest asserted. It declared that these exceptions reflect "the ebbs and flows of political decisionmaking," and need not lead to the conclusion that "Congress was insincere." The "sufficiency of the federal interest [must be evaluated] as a matter of law rather than of psychological analysis." Id. at 1064 n.17. That is, of course, unless it is possible that Congress is seeking to achieve an illegitimate ulterior purpose, which is hardly the case here.

It is, of course, hardly fair to say that Congress is requiring the states to draft and enact new laws. The situation presented here is one in which the states may decide that it is wise to enact new laws in the light of a valid enactment by Congress under one of its delegated powers that renders previous state legislation obsolete or inappropriate. One would imagine that this is a common occurrence. 100 Id. at 1071-72, citing, as a likely example of the standard of proof that might be required to demonstrate that age is a "bona fide occupational qualification" for a job, the standard employed by the Fourth Circuit in Arritt v. Grisell, 567 F.2d 1267, 1271 (4th Cir. 1977), that there be "a factual basis for believing that all or substantially all persons within the class . . would be unable to perform safely and efficiently the duties involved, or that it is impossible or impractical to deal with persons over the age limit on an individualized basis." This language is a paraphrase of that of the Fifth Circuit in Usery v. Tamiami Trail Tours, 531 F.2d 224, 236 (1976), involving the application of the ADEA to a private employer, which in turn, paraphrased the language of Weeks v. Southern Bell Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 408 F.2d 228, 235, 235 n.5 (1969), involving Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ?2000e-2. The suggestion that it would essentially be impossible to meet this standard in an age discrimination case appears to be wrong. Some federal courts have sustained claims that age is a "bona fide occupational qualification." See, e.g., Hodgson v. Greyhound Lines, 499 F.2d 859 (7th Cir. 1974), cert. denied sub nom. Brennan v. Greyhound Lines, 419 U.S. 1122 (1975) (initial hiring of bus drivers); Usery v. Tamiami Trail Tours, supra (initial hiring of bus drivers); Murnane v. American Airlines, 667 F.2d 98 (D.C. Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 915 (1982) (initial hiring of flight officers). In any event, if the courts are using too rigid a standard for determining what constitutes a "bona fide occupational qualification," the proper response of the Court would seem to be to loosen the standard, not to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional.</page><page sequence="52">266 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1983 issue, because the Court had found that the challenge failed to meet the third part of the test. He paused to note that even if it could have been held that that part of the test had been satisfied, it might still have been necessary to conclude that the federal interest underlying the statute was sufficiently great to justify its intrusion into state autonomy.?30 Chief Justice Burger, on the other hand, believed that the federal interest was "largely theoretical" and did not outweigh the strong state interest in insuring the physical preparedness of law enforcement and fire prevention personnel.302 Little would be served by an effort to choose between the arguments in the majority opinion and in the dissent about the degree of impact that the federal prohibition against mandatory early retirement laws would be likely to have on the states. It is equally fruitless to debate whether the federal interest in preventing the exclusion of able individuals from productive labor in the national economy outweighs the state interest in insuring the physical preparedness of game wardens or other law enforcement or fire prevention personnel. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the resolution of the constitutional issue in this case did not turn, either for the majority or the dissenters, on an objective assessment of the impact on the states or of the comparative strengths of the federal and state interests involved, but rather that the process worked in reverse: the individual Justices decided first how they thought the constitutional question should be answered and then magnified or disparaged the federal or state concerns accordingly. The incoherence of a concept such as structuring the integral operations of state or local governments is, of course, an open invitation to engage in a process of conclusion first, reasoning second. If the purpose of prohibiting the federal government from interfering with integral state operations -whatever that means-is to preserve the "separate and independent existence" of the states (which is what the Court suggested in National League of Cities)303 then only by engaging in the grossest exaggeration can it be said that requiring the states to observe the requirements of the ADEA would have that effect. If, as is more probable, the intended purpose of the prohibition is to allow the Court to find interference with integral operations whenever it concludes that Congress is imposing unnecessary or unjustified o01 103 S.

There are no valid reasons for shifting policymaking responsibility to the courts in this area. Not only are the "political safeguards of federalism" fully applicable,'" but the additional political safeguards created by the fact that the law also covers those working for private employers~~ -including employees responsible for the safety and security of individuals or of the public'"-are present. This means that, if the requirements of the law are indeed unreasonable, the Members of Congress responsible for its passage can surely be expected to be exposed to the political repercussions of imposing such requirements generally on the society as a whole. Since it is conceded that Congress has constitutional authority to prohibit age discrimination against airline pilots,0"' there is hardly greater justification, in terms of public safety, for denying it constitutional authority to prohibit the same form of discrimination against state game wardens. The very fact that Congress has allowed exceptions to the ADEA for various categories of federal employees demonstrates that it is willing to grant exceptions in cases where it can be persuaded that there are cogent reasons for doing so. Since there is no reason to assume congressional hostility toward the states, it should be expected that Congress would be prepared to grant them similar exceptions for those of their employees performing physically strenuous jobs if it can be shown to its satisfaction that these exceptions are warranted. There is thus no basis for arguing that when Congress makes the policy determination that an exception is not warranted, the issue may be reopened in the courts. Because the Court's reasoning in Wyoming necessarily calls for a judicial reexamination of what is a purely policy question, it marks the triumph, not the demise, of the National League of Cities approach.

One can certainly understand the new majority's apparent concern for the principle of stare decisis, but what is involved here is not merely an erroneous interpretation of a statute, or even an erroneous interpretation of the Constitution--where the case for stare decisis is weaker30'-but an erroneous assertion of judicial authority to decide on the merits or wisdom of a policy chosen by Congress. In the latter context, stare decisis need play no part at all." B. THE SOLILOQUY There was an additional issue in Wyoming: whether Congress had authority to extend the ADEA to the states on the basis of its power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the majority upheld the application of the Act to the states under the commerce power, it had no need to discuss whether it could also have been sustained as an exercise of Fourteenth Amendment and did not do so, except to reiterate that the National League of Cities doctrine was inapplicable to congressional enactments grounded in that authority."3' However, the dissenters' conclusion that the law could not be upheld as an exercise of the commerce power required them to examine the issue. Chief Justice Burger began his discussion of this question with the startling assertion that the Tenth Amendment does not impose the same limitations on Congress's power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment as it does on Congress's commerce power, because, unlike the Commerce Clause, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted after the Tenth Amendment."' The implications of this line of reasoning-that the chronological order of the adoption of individual provisions of the Constitution has a bearing on how they are to be interpreted relative to one another-are quite remarkable. Congress would have more authority to abridge freedom of speech when acting under a power granted to it subsequent to the adoption of 08 See Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 405-11 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). 09 Because National League of Cities called for judicial reevaluation of the policy decisions of Congress relative to interstate commerce, Justice Stevens declared, in his concurring opinion in Wyoming, that National League of Cities was "inconsistent with the central purpose of the Constitution itself, ... [and] not entitled to the deference that the doctrine of stare decisis ordinarily commands for this Court's precedents." 103 S. Ct. at 1067 (concurring opinion). 'o Id. at 1064 n.18.

Perhaps the states might be able to disregard the requirements of due process or equal protection in legislating on the subject of intoxicants under the Twenty-first Amendment."'2 Surely this argument-which was apparently still another vain effort to explain how federalism can place limits on Congress's commerce power but not its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment- collapses quickly of its own weight. Even if it could be accepted, it would offer no justification for interpreting the Tenth Amendment to limit the commerce power. It is obviously true that the Tenth Amendment was added to the Constitution after the Commerce Clause; it is settled that it did not change the Constitution in any way but was "merely declaratory of the distribution of powers made in the original Constitution.'""'1 Thus, even if it could be read as a prohibition--which it emphatically cannot-it places no limitations on the commerce power that were not inherent in the Commerce Clause itself."' On the merits of the Fourteenth Amendment question, the Chief Justice's argument was that Congress lacked power to override state mandatory retirement laws as a means of enforcing the Equal Protection Clause, because such laws have never been held to violate that Clause."' He conceded that Congress's power under the Fourteenth Amendment may enable it "to enact legislation that prohibits conduct not in itself unconstitutional" but only where "the prohibition [is] necessary to guard against enroachment of guaranteed rights or to rectify past discrimination.""'

Morgan"' and a hopelessly fragmented Court, four years later in Oregon v. Mitchell,"' failed to reaffirm that decision. But some discrimination on the basis of age would be difficult to defend as constitutional--for example, establishing a maximum age for attendance at a state university or the right to vote in a state election. Since age is not a suspect classification, courts will uphold classifications based on age unless they cannot be said to be rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate public purpose.320 This extremely relaxed standard is maintained so that courts will not substitute their own views of proper public policy for those of the states.32' But because of the liberality of this test some arguably unconstitutional acts of age discrimination may be upheld by the courts. Unlike the courts, however, Congress has policymaking responsibility, which it should be free to exercise. It may, therefore, legitimately substitute its views on policy for those of the states with regard to Fourteenth Amendment questions and need not be limited by the rationality standard that limits the courts. Its constitutional respon- sibility to enforce the Equal Protection Clause should carry with it the authority to require state laws establishing discriminatory classifica- tions to meet a stricter standard of public necessity.322 C.

There were two other opinions in the case. Justice Stevens, who joined the opinion of the Court (thereby making it an opinion for the Court), wrote a separate concurrence directly challenging the assumptions on which the majority's reasoning rested. Justice Powell, who was joined by Justice O'Connor, added a separate dissent for the sole purpose of responding to Justice Stevens. Justice Stevens found the focus on whether constitutional limitations drawn from the Tenth Amendment or from principles of federalism inherent in the Constitution were transgressed in this case to be fundamentally misconceived. The question, as he saw it, had nothing to do with constitutional limitations, because none was "even arguably applicable."323 The question was "purely one of constitutional power."324"' National League of Cities, he argued, was "pure judicial fiat"325 and, therefore, like the cases prior to 1937 that gave an artificially narrow construction to the Commerce Clause and "whose. . rejection is now universally regarded as proper," it should be given a "prompt rejection" as "inconsistent with the central purpose of the Constitution itself."326 The "central purpose" was, for him, embodied in the Commerce Clause, because it was the perceived need for effective national authority to regulate interstate commerce that was the primary reason for the drafting of the Constitution.327 The execution of that responsibility is the national government's "central mission."328 The ADEA, like the Fair Labor Standards Act, thus reflects a congressional policy judgment about the legislation that is needed to carry out an aspect of that "central mission"-regulation of the "American labor market."3'29 Although Justice Stevens indicated his personal disagreement with the policy of prohibiting mandatory early retirement-as, in his National League of Cities dissent, he had 32Z 103 S.

Unfortuna- tely, his opinion is largely a succession of non sequiturs. He begins by challenging Justice Stevens's contention that the concern that led to the adoption of the Commerce Clause was the "central problem that gave rise to the Constitution itself."'" Although he conceded that this "was one of the Constitution's purposes,"336 he insisted that "one can be reasonably sure that few of the Founding Fathers thought that trade barriers among the States were 'the central problem,' or that their elimination was the 'central mission' of the Constitutional Conven- tion.'"' The true central mission, in Justice Powell's view, was "[c]reating a national government within a federal system,"331 a proposition which he supported by noting that the focus of the 1787 convention was heavily on issues of the structure of the national government and its relationship to the states, that the regulation of commerce was not listed among the purposes for the adoption of the Constitution set forth in the Preamble, and that the commerce power was not even listed first among the powers delegated to Congress in Article I, section 8.J Justice Powell's point confuses the purpose in establishing the Constitution with the problems of detail that had to be faced once the decision to establish it was reached.

The fact that the grant of power to Congress to regulate commerce was so little debated and occupied so little of the attention of the convention'" is itself testimony that the imperative need for this grant was universally understood and accepted by the delegates, and suggests in context that they may have recognized it as a prime purpose of their endeavors. Nor can much be made of the absence of any specific mention of commerce among the purposes for the adoption of the Constitution set forth in the Preamble. Justice Powell recognized that the protection of commerce could be subsumed within the end of "promot[ing] the general welfare," even though he expressed some doubt about whether it really was, since the term "general welfare" had not encompassed interstate commerce when it was employed in the Articles of Confederation.3" But in any event, the protection of interstate commerce surely falls squarely within the very first of the purposes mentioned in the Preamble-"to form a more perfect Union." The absence of any central authority to control interstate commerce was a principal imperfection in the Union under the Articles of Confederation.342 It is difficult to take seriously an argument that denigrates the significance of the commerce power because it was not listed first in Article I, section 8. To be sure, it was not. It is preceded by the power "to lay and collect Taxes," which power is given for the purpose of enabling Congress to appropriate money "to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare," and by the power to '" See e.g., MURPHY, note 175 supra, at 182-83: "Commercial reform was, of course, the stated reason for the convening of the Annapolis convention, which led to the calling of the Philadelphia convention. In light of this background, it is not surprising that the draft reported to the convention by the Committee of Detail contained the broad and unqualified grant of power to Congress 'to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states.' Nor is it surprising that when this clause came up for consideration on August 16, it was approved by the convention without discussion and without dissent. So easily and readily was a huge and vitally important area of legislative power transferred from the states to the nation." See also the statement of James Madison in Federalist No. 45 that the grant to Congress of the commerce power was one "which few oppose." THE FEDERALIST, note 157 supra, at 314. '41 103 S.

III. 342 See, e.g., Stern, note 58 supra, at 1337.</page><page sequence="60">274 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1983 "borrow money on the credit of the United States." Justice Powell seems to conclude from this that "[i]t is evident that the authority to tax and to 'provide for the common Defence' loomed larger among the concerns of the Founders than other powers granted Congress."33 If his point is merely that the framers were also profoundly concerned with the need to grant Congress an effective power of taxation and the means to defend the nation, it is unobjectionable. But this in no way contradicts Justice Stevens's contention that commercial concerns provided the direct motivation for calling the convention. Moreover, the "rank order" argument for establishing priority of importance among the powers delegated in Article I, section 8, that Justice Powell appears to be espousing is itself problematic, to say the least. It would not explain, for example, why the power to borrow money appears so high on the list, and, since the powers relating to defense are not actually granted in the first clause, it would not explain why one would have to wait until Clauses 11-13 (after the power to grant patents and copyrights) until the war power and the power to raise and support an army and navy are reached. The main difficulty with Justice Stevens's opinion, in Justice Powell's view, was that it ignored the fact that the system of government embodied in the Constitution recognized the existence of "state governments that retained a significant measure of sovereign authority."' But Justice Stevens did not dispute this. He merely assumed-as would appear inescapably necessary in the light of the Supremacy Clause-that a fundamental principle of the constitutional system is that the sovereignty of the states must yield to an exercise by Congress of one of its delegated powers.3" Given the Supremacy Clause, the only question, for Justice Stevens, was whether complete regulation of the American labor market, including the public sector, was within the reach of the commerce power, a question he saw as having "only one answer."'" Justice Powell makes no real effort to challenge the proposition that regulation of the labor market is a valid exercise of the commerce power, but he suggests that that power must be limited by considerations of state sovereignty and declares that it was not the 4' 103 S.

In support of that rather extraordinary contention, he cites the provisions of the Constitution that recognize the existence of the states as a fundamental component of the governmental system; the understanding of the framers, as described by Madison in Federalist No. 45, that the delegated powers of the national government "are few and defined," while the reserved powers of the states "are numerous and indefinite;""' and, incredibly, the various arguments for the doctrine of interposition that were asserted from the time of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 and 1799'49 to the assertion by John Calhoun3" of state power of nullification of acts of Congress."'

William Murphy, in his study of the influence of the concept of state sovereignty on the framing and ratification of the Constitution, concluded that, whatever the limitations on the powers of Congress may be, "it is clear that [they] were not to be imposed by considerations of state sovereignty.'"" Unless the Marshall Court is to be accused of overriding completely the intent of the framers, that is the only conclusion compatible with its decisions establishing the bedrock principles of the federal-state relationship in cases such as Martin v. Hunter's Lessee,"' McCulloch v. Maryland,'M and Gibbons v. Ogden."' Justice Powell dismisses Gibbons v.

Justice Powell confidently claims that the Constitution would not "have been recommended by the Convention, much less ratified, if it had been understood that the Commerce Clause ... [had given Congress power to regulate] the personnel practices of state and local governments,'"" an observation which is entirely ahistorical. Even if it were true, it could also be claimed, with equal confidence, that the Constitution would never have been ratified if it had been understood that Congress would have power under the Commerce Clause to control the terms and conditions of employment of the employees of local business enterprises within the states. Today the power of Congress to regulate private employment contracts is beyond challenge, but that proposi- tion would have been no less shocking in 1787 (as the congressional authority to do so is no less destructive of the concept of state sovereignty) than the proposition that once the power to regulate the national labor market is conceded, that power, to be effective, must extend to public as well as private employment. It is true that, as noted by Madison in Federalist No. 45, the powers of Congress "are few and defined" while those of the states "are numerous and indefinite."

WYOMING 277 breadth of those "few" powers was to be provided by the federal government's conception of national need."' It strains credibility that Justice Powell would seek to counter the evidence of this proposition by reliance, as an indication of the framers' intent, on the assertions of the doctrines of interposition and nullification that were made from time to time in the early years of the nation's history and which were later resurrected by the South to protest the Supreme Court's school desegregation decisions of 1954.362 The idea of interposition or nullification--that it was within the power of a state to determine when the federal government had exceeded its constitutional authority, and that it could declare such actions to be "unauthoritative, void, and of no force""' -could in no sense be reflective of the framers' intent. If accepted, it would defeat the purpose of the Constitution to ensure that the federal government had the authority necessary to carry out its responsibilities without dependence upon the cooperation or agreement of individual states. It would mean that the federal government would have no constitutional authority that the states themselves were not prepared to accept, which would, in turn, necessarily mean that there would be as many versions of the Constitution and of federal law as there were states. As Justice Story observed in a related context: "The public mischiefs that would attend such a state of things would be truly deplorable; and it cannot be believed that they could have escaped the enlightened convention which formed the constitution."'" To be sure, Justice Powell disavowed any "suggest[ion] that either the doctrine of interposition or that of nullification was constitutional- ly sound."''. But he nevertheless implied that they had a serious claim '" It should be recalled that, in the same paper quoted by Justice Powell, Madison also declared that the fundamental needs of the nation were not to be sacrificed so that "individual States ... might enjoy a certain extent of power, and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of sovereignty."

See, for a statement of interposition theory written in this period, KILPATRICK, THE SOVEREIGN STATES (1957). The definitive appraisal of this theory was given by a three-judge District Court in Louisiana in 1960, which declared that "interposition is not a constitutional doctrine. If taken seriously, it is illegal defiance of constitutional authority." Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 188 F. Supp. 916, 926 (1960), summarily affirmed, 364 U.S. 500 (1960). See also Cooper v.

But these doctrines are so fundamen- tally at odds with the notion of a Union that they cannot be evidence of the actual intent of the framers unless one assumes that the framers had no concern for the maintenance of the Union. Their only serious claim to legitimacy is that their initial formal statement-made in response to the notorious Alien and Sedition Acts of 179838--came in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, drafted by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, respectively. But these were not accurate expressions of either man's understanding of the meaning of the Constitution, but declarations of protest against an instance of tyrannical behavior. Jefferson's statements were tailored for the specific occasion. As Dumas Malone has observed, in Jefferson's writings in the period 1798-99, he "went further in his emphasis on the rights and powers of the states vis-a-vis the general government than he had ever done before or was ever to do again."369 For Madison, the doctrine of interposition was antithetical to his views as expressed at the Constitutional Convention, in The Federalist, and in Congress. Not surprisingly, he later expressed vigorous opposition to it. He noted correctly that, at bottom, it was only coherent as a theory of secession. In his "Notes on Nullification," written in the final year of his life, he provided a fitting description of the theory that Justice Powell claims to constitute evidence of the intention of the framers of the Constitution on the question of state sovereignty:370 But it follows, from no view of the subject, that a nullification of a law of the U.S. can as is now contended, belong rightfully to a single State, as one of the parties to the Constitution; the State not ceasing to avow its adherence to the Constitution.

A more accurate statement of the framers' understanding of the relationship of the reserved powers of the states to the delegated powers of Congress was offered by James Madison, in the First Congress, speaking in opposition to the establishment of the Bank of the United States. Madison believed that establishing the bank would be unconstitutional because the power to do so was not within the scope of the powers delegated to Congress by the Constitution. If it were within the scope of a delegated power, however, state sovereignty would not, in his view, have been relevant to the question of its constitutionality. He declared that:7"3 Interference with the power of the States was no constitutional criterion of the power of Congress. If the power was not given, Congress could not exercise it; if given, they might exercise it, although it should interfere with the laws, or even the Constitution of the States. Justice Powell's view that the Supreme Court has recognized and accepted for almost two hundred years that the delegated powers of Congress were limited by the reserved powers of the states is directly contrary to the position taken by the Court in the most famous decisions of the Marshall era, which established the basic principles of American constitutional jurisprudence."7 Far more accurate was Justice Brennan's observation in National League of Cities that "our decisions over the last century and a half have explicitly rejected the existence of any such restraint on the commerce power."'"

Justice Brennan, joined by Justices White and Marshall, had made a similar point in dissent in National League of Cities, " but did not press it in this case, perhaps out of respect for stare decisis or perhaps out of a desire to bring Justice Blackmun into the majority."7 But in the face of the Court's inability or unwillingness to provide a reasoned basis for the National League of Cities approach, its continued use of the doctrine of that case as a potential vehicle for invalidating acts of Congress under the commerce power is accurately described by Justice Stevens as "pure judicial fiat."''7 Arbitrary judicial interference with congressional ability to control the public sector of the economy at the state and local level can have a potentially serious impact, as Justice Stevens has noted, in light of the significant proportion of the overall work force that is made up of state and local employees.8 IV. CONCLUSION The Court's decision in EEOC v. Wyoming is likely to satisfy no one. Those who would defend the Court's decision in National League of Cities can only be chagrined at the Court's failure once again to duplicate the result of that case and to strike down an act of Congress on its authority. In the light of the near identity of the facts in the two cases, they may well see in Wyoming an ominous portent that National League of Cities will never have progeny-that, while it may not be immediately overruled, it will be distinguished away in every case and thus limited to its precise facts. On the other hand, those who view National League of Cities as an unfortunate and unjustified exercise in judicial review, in which an act of Congress was struck down on the basis of what Justice Brennan described as an "abstraction without substance, founded neither in the ' Hammer v.

The problems in the reasoning of National League of Cities are substantial. The Court's failure in Wyoming-as in every other case since 1976 in which the opportunity to do so has been presented-to attempt to confront and resolve these problems is regrettable. If, as seems likely, the problems are too intractable to be resolved adequately, it would be better for the Court frankly to acknowledge that National League of Cities was in error and to abandon it than to continue the practice that Wyoming seems to exemplify-of distinguishing it either on the basis of minor differences in the facts or by magnifying the importance of the federal interest to be protected, or of downplaying the impact of the challenged law on the states. Until then, the threat will always be present that the National League of Cities doctrine will be revived and a critical aspect of Congress's power over commerce subjected to limitations that are derived, not from any constitutional principles of general applicability, but solely from the Justices' conception of desirable public policy.
