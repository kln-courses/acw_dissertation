<plain_text><page sequence="1">Luchino Visconti's last film, L'Innocente , 1979, is his adaptation of Gabriele D'Annunzio's fin de siècle novel of the same name published in 1892, and takes its place in the filmmaker's series of portrayals of decadent European society. The first page of D'Annunzio's novel begins with a question: Should I go before the judge and say: I have committed a crime. He [his illegitimate child] would not be dead if I had not killed him. It is I, Tullio Hermill, who am his assassin. . . . Can I go before the judge? Can I speak to him like that? I cannot, and I will not. . . . There is no tribunal on earth competent to judge me. And yet I feel a desire to accuse myself, to confess. I feel a desire to reveal my secret to someone. To WHOM?! This question is asked by the murderer of the bastard delivered from his wife and sired by her lover of a fleeting moment. It is never answered in the novel, for Tullio Hermil, the hero and first-person narrator, never confesses. But is is precisely to answer this question that Visconti has made in his film changes and departures from D'Annunzio. He has Tullio in the final scene confess the murder of the infant to his mistress, Teresa Raffo; relieved of his burden of silence, Tullio commits suicide. To make the suicide necessary, Visconti has Juliana, Tullio's wife confess to a great love for Filippo d'Arborio, the father of the murdered child, and hatred for her husband who has killed him. In this way Visconti has altered the fundamental triangle in D'Annunzio's novel which is formed only by Tullio, his wife Juliana and the infant Raymond. 132</page><page sequence="2">L'Innocente 1 133 The mistress, Teresa Raffo, plays no important role in the novel, existing onlv off-stage and as part of the past, for the novel is devoted exclusively to Tuillo's outraged sense of dispossession of his wife, his torture before and after the birth of a child which cannot be his own and his plans for the virtual murder of the child by exposing him to the wintry air from an open window. Neither does the lover, Filippo d'Arborio, have any importance other than to inscribe one of his novels to Juliana and to have impregnated her in her brief moment of infidelity. Her affections are completely bound to her husband and her horror at the birth of the child equals his. The secret of the child's paternity is not shared by anyone else in the novel; neither Tullio's mother nor brother realizes that the child is an "Intruder," as the title of the English translation is known. The dilemma of the hero who has neglected his wife for a mistress and who cannot accept the existence of someone else's child as his own, since it denies his sense of family continuity and total possession of his wife, fills the novel with a suffocating sense of frustration. The triangle is strictly between the husband, the wife and the innocent cause of their problem. Visconti has made the triangle between the husband, his mistress and his wife. Juliana's lover is now called d'Arborio. He becomes with his offspring the infant Raymond, a more active participant. What had been for D'Annunzio a psychological confession, told in the first person singular and consequently bound chiefly to the psyche of one man, has become for Visconti a visual demonstration. To open up this internalized drama, Visconti has developed situations occurring in the novel but subject now to changes. One transformation is that of Federico, Tullio Hermil's brother. In the book his character is based on Tolstoy's hero in War and Peace , a novel evoked by name because it gives meaning and background to Federico's relation to the soil and his concern with nature, his care for plants and the cultivation of trees on the family property. Juliana's expressions remind Tullio of the Princess's in Tolstoy's novel, and the parallel is stressed in order to emphasize the identification of Tullio's family, including the bastard child, with all the growth and decay existing in nature. D'Annunzio's sensual attachment to organic life creates a system of symbols, part of continental fin de siècle art that has been only partially stressed by Visconti, who has more of a city temperament. This symbolism is reflected in the parallel between the necessity of chopping down diseased trees and the necessity of eliminating the diseased bastard who disturbs the family succession. Federico's need to get rid of unhealthy growths on the estate becomes through analogy a justification for the in- fanticide. The entire nature parallel has been eliminated by Visconti. He does retain, equipped with a wonderful assemblage of furniture and pictures chosen to emphasize their differences, the three houses that appear in the novel: the couple's house, La Badiola, Hermil's mother's country house, and Villalilla, the Villa of Lilacs, now uninhabited, where Tullio and Juliana spent the early years of their married life and where he once more makes love to Juliana now pregnant with her lover's child. Federico Hermil, transformed by Visconti from a man of the soil to an urban dandy, introduces Filippo d'Arborio (now ennobled) to his sister-in-law, a fact invented by the film- maker. Visconti has also retained D'Annunzio's fin de siècle symbols including a passage from Glucks Orphée , lavender-blue hydrangeas and the lilacs that give their name to the Villalilla, the flowers' color with Juliana's lavender after- noon dress to alert the spectator to the basic tone of the Mauve Decade. Teresa Raffo, Hermil's mistress, (Jennifer O'Neil) now a Countess, has become</page><page sequence="3">134 1 L'Innocente a blazing brunette, while the wife is blond, a reversal of their types as D'Annunzio created them. Visconti has had to break the coherence of D'Annunzio's system of sym- bols because from a cinematic point of view, the claustrophobic effect, appropriate to a work of fiction bent on restricting the field to focus on an un- relieved emotional impasse, is not appropriate to the moving surface of film shots. But the director has achieved the effect by his own means in two ways. One is by the lavishness and authenticity of the fin de siècle decor of the three houses. Variety as well as fidelity to the novel is achieved by showing the furniture protected by coverings in an unused summer house, while the other two houses, one a hotel de ville , the other a family suburban villa now (not a country estate) of a previous generation, are loaded with the rich arti- facts both inherited and collected by the urban Italian haute-bourgeoisie of the period. The second means is the focus on Giancarlo Giannini's (Tullio HermiPs) suffering eyes. His dilemma in the film is the choice between wife and mistress. The horror of cuckoldry is emphasized rather than the insupport- ability of looking at the evidence, the bastard Raymond, or at the loss of proprietary rights over his wife, since Visconti has changed Hermil from a landowner who neglects his acres to an urban playboy. Visconti insists, through HermiPs seduction of a healthy never-before-sexually aroiised wife in the Villalilla, on a reborn physical satisfaction. D'Annunzio ignores this aspect of their relationship, for Juliana is con- stantly ailing and sickly. Her bastard is equally sickly and is murdered quite easily by the exposure to winter winds. D'Annunzio's thrust is in the direc- tion of the disturbance that the intruding infant created in the family se- clusion, a family that cannot stand, from the point of view of normal growth, any foreign strains of decay, moral or physical. The contrast in D'Annunzio's novel is between growth and decay, health and illness. What is emphasized is the need to prevent deterioration of natural forms, both in the produce of the inherited acres as well as in the offspring from human seed. The horror for Tullio especially is that the "innocent" babe is the first boy in his closely- knit family (he and Juliana have already had two girls, a fact omitted in the film). The constant illness of Juliana in the novel, the frailty of her lover, Arborio (his name symbolically deriving from "tree") and their sickly infant have been transformed in the film into healthy, rosy personages that resemble figures in Venetian Renaissance paintings. The seduction scene where Juliana's voluptuous naked body is contrasted vividly to Tullio's formal suit suggests certain of Veronese's paintings. But more pertinent to the literary model is the manner in which Visconti has photographed Juliana's (Laura Antonelli's) body, for in the novel Arborio had dedicated his book to "Juliana Hermil, Turris Eburnea," (Ivory Tower). Visconti has taken quite literally the two sentences that follow this dedica- tion where Tullio identifies himself with his rival. "Had I not found in certain of his literary creations strange resemblances with my inner being? And suppose the strange affinity that there is between us facilitated his work of seduction, perhaps already undertaken?"2 Visconti makes his ď Arborio look almost exactly like Tullio, a striking alter ego, whereas in the novel, after the one identification quoted above, the differences rather than the similarities are stressed, in the repeated references to Arborio's physical fraility and nervous disorders. In the novel the writer dies from "progressive bulbar paralysis" 3 so that the apparent sickliness of his infant is pronounced enough to have Tullio never suspected of infantcide.</page><page sequence="4">L'Innocente / 135 In the film the healthy baby is also the child of a healthy father, for Visconti has ďArborio die of an infectious disease picked up in Africa where he had gone presumably to recover from his passion for Juliana. In the novel their affair is brief and is simply on Juliana's part a momentary lapse after a long period of chronic invalidism and abandonment by her husband. The title of the novel that the writer had dedicated to Juliana (the dis- covery of which alerts her husband's suspicions) has been changed from the symbolic one, II Segreto , in D'Annunzio's book, (for the child Juliana bears is "the secret") to The Flame . This substitution seems to suggest two things. One is the fire of the passion between Juliana and d'Arborio, for in the film Visconti has made a radical change from his literary model. Juliana is now made to love her lover and to hate her husband for killing their baby, thus preparing the way for Tullio's suicide in the film. The other possible reason for changing the name of d'Arborio's novel is that II Fuoco , The Flame (1900) is the title of D'Annunzio's most famous novel, written exactly at the century's turn. Visconti also makes use of the symbolic value of such a title, more visual than The Secret , by reinforcing its meaning in camera shots of fires in fireplaces. The wider reference to other D'Annunzian novels includes Tullio's suicide which, although it is not in LTnnocent , is the dramatic finale of II Triompho della Morte , The Triumph of Death (1896) in which a man, finding his obsessive passion for his mistress intolerable, kills both her and himself. Visconti's changes have produced a film, his last, that most fully develops his interest in fin de siècle Europe evident in his work of the past ten years. Vaghe Stelle dell'Orsa (1965) initiated a period of thirteen years which saw six full length films (one short one for Boccaccio ' 70 ; Il Lavoro was three years earlier) devoted exclusively to the diseases of society and ranged from the period of pre-World-War One Death in Venice , back to the 1880s in Ludwig , and forward to the Nazi regime in Germany in The Damned. Visconti has always supported his view of society by a basically socialist, even communist, bias, either because of or in spite of his aristocratic inheritance. Coming from the north of Italy and being familiar with the labor problems of that area, his great film Rocco and his Brothers (1960) undeniably re- flects those problems. The Leopardy filmed three years later, shows the disintegration of a Sicilian benevolent aristocratic despotism, nostalgically regretted, historically doomed and concretely realized through the ancestral home and its treasures. In this film one feels that the spoils of an aristocracy have preempted the field of vision, and that in spite of Visconti's theoretical Marxism, his eye and hand as director have been guided by the exquisite material culture of the gradually powerless aristocrats, made acutely im- pressive by its implied autobiographical reference. The dramatic tension between objects of beauty and their proprietors who are corrupted and obsessed characters finds its greatest expression in Ludwig , for the historical facts fit to perfection the contradictions which exist in the director's own person. His resolution is through a visual myth that depends on historical truth approached by an anthropomorphic point of view. It is not often that history presents to a director obsessed himself with a collector-cum- museum curator's attitude to objets de'art a subject as appropriate as Ludwig! There are certain constants that reappear in all of Visconti's films, includ- ing this last. One constant is dependence on a literary model which serves as a springboard for his auteur relation to his work, a relation which demands deviations and personal tamperings with the original. Beginning with James Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice , the model for Obsessions , in 1942, and Verga's fiction, the model forLö Terra Trema , 1947, one finds in the later</page><page sequence="5">lSülLlnnocente films a remarkable variety of literary sources- not only Lampedusa, Camus and Maupassant, but also Aeschylus ( Vaghe Stelle delVOrsa , a title drawn from the opening line of a famous poem by Leopardi, "La Ricordanza" ), Thomas Mann and finally D'Annunzio. Music has been another constant marvelously integrated not only with the visual field but with the donnee of the story- Wagner as part of Ludwig's obsession, Mahler as the theme of Death in Venice where the hero has been changed from an author to a composer. The relation of Verdi to Senso is both political and musical. In Llnnocente two concerts not in the original novel have been introduced by Visconti to create a perfect matrix for an erotic and aesthetic mood. The air from Gliick's Orphée , so important in the novel, is also featured in the film, but in addition works by Mozart and other composers are sung by the performers at the concerts to create the mood of the passive aestheticism of the Italian urban upper classes. The tendency in the last films is to contain the drama within the milieu of the richly upholstered interiors. The flowers are cut and brought within, thus becoming part of interior decoration. Their suggested fragrance extends the sensory radii which sight and sound have created. D'Annunzio wrote in his private journal, the Libro Segreto , "To bring everything, every event, every phenomenon into my art, into my works of art: that is my law."4 In this respect Visconti is his ideal interpreter, and it is fortunate that before his death he was able to help bring back into repute the work of the only Italian literary genius of the first half of the century, long under the shadow of Fascist collaboration and the disapproval of the fin de siècle ύ Visconti can get away with such material, since he is a social critic. (D'Annunzio's novels, it should be emphasized, are themselves a criticism of the erotic-aesthetic life by their very plots). However, the lavish care with which Visconti builds up the milieu seems to show that he is contentedly committed to placing dramas within the upholstered, hot-house atmosphere of D'Annunzio's early novels. For L'Innocente is the second in a trio of novels called Romanzi della Rose , Novels of the Rose , written before D'Annunzio was much over thirty and all feeding into Visconti's film. Il Piacere ( The Child of Pleasure) includes an auction scene which Visconti borrowed, and the suicide of Aurispa in The Triumph of Death is transferred to Tullio Hermil in Visconti's adaptation of LTnnocenteã D'Annunzio's endings, which show how intolerable a purely obsessive life of the senses must become, create their own criticism without the need for an independent socialist censure, even though the novelist himself continued his erotomania and his collector's mania into his years of senility. His loss was the obvious one of creative excellence. In Visconti's last film not only is time historically removed from the present, but the visual field has been confined only to interiors. The director seems most at home in city palaces and mansions, which makes his short film for Boccaccio ' 70 a masterpiece of drama contained within a luxurious palazzo operating metaphorically as both a prison and a brothel for the young wife. Even the Venice oí Death in Venice is treated as an interior, with a focus on covered passageways and hotel public rooms, but an interior sanctified by an illustrious past. For Venice, in the prose of Henry James, "has the character of an immense collective apartment in which the Piazza San Marco is the most ornamented corner and palaces and churches, for the rest, play the part of great divans of repose, tables of entertainment, expanses of decoration."5 In the last years of his life Visconti seems to have made his films out of what life had given him, in spite of what he might have deplored as social</page><page sequence="6">L'Innocente /137 injustice. To look outside his social milieu exclusively to make his social comments would be to sacrifice his familiarity with, and obvious affection for, the visible objects of aesthetic contemplation which fortunately for us have occupied, in "glorious technicolor," the films of his last decade. In his personal development as a director he seems to have realized that his selection and arrangements of these objects would embody his social comments. Nor has he created an indoor museum with its attendant suffocating atmo- sphere, since his interiors were not the product of museum curators but of cultivated human beings who inherited and acquired their thjngsģ One regrets that Visconti did not live to film Proust's A la Recherche Du Temps Perdu , perhaps the greatest monument to a decadent society, for it would surely, by the very nature of its evocative locations, have been a glittering addition to his brilliant series of portrayals of the Europe of the last century. The profusion of carefully selected objects and the correspondence between the limited visual field and the obsessive nature of his recent heroes' concerns show a perfect auteuristic control by Visconti of his distinguished literary models.
