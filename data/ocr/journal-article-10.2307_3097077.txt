GUNKEL, Doane College This paper reconsiders the political constraints and organizational dynamics which limit standard-setting by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Past research is dominated by class analytic perspectives which trace the failure of regulatory agencies to either direct "capture" by regulated industries or widespread concern about business confidence. This paper synthesizes the insights of critical legal studies and recent work in political sociology to further specify the social bases of corporate power in the regulatory arena. Critical legal scholars emphasize the ways in which "class neutral" legal statutes create opportunities for capital at the expense of subordinate groups. Recent work in political sociology clarifies the complex organizational and insti- tutional dynamics that shape the mobilization of strategic resources in the context of political opportunities. Using a sample that covers 25 years, we examine the extent to which due process in standard-setting favors capi- tal at the expense of labor due to disparities in resource mobilization. Due process provides capital several oppor- tunities to challenge regulatory initiatives. Capital, led by trade associations and Fortune 500 companies, has consistently mobilized the resources necessary to exploit these opportunities. In contrast, organizational con- straints have seriously limited the mobilization of labor and its potential allies, including state technocrats, to defend regulatory initiatives. We identify two far-reaching gains secured by capital given these disparities. On the one hand, the mobilization of a corporate countermovement in any one case may have precluded the effective defense of other regulatory initiatives, since the resources of labor and regulatory agencies are easily exhausted. On the other hand, the mobilization of capital has served to safeguard its right to due process and the opportuni- ties this right affords. We conclude that due process in standard-setting in the context of resource disparities nec- essarily favors capital because it inevitably results in "opportunity costs," reflected in the hundreds of regulatory initiatives that remain dormant indefinitely. In 1971, labor celebrated with cautious optimism the creation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) after a protracted struggle against capital and its Republi- can allies. I.W. Abel, president of the United Steelworkers of America, warned that the new agency would make a difference only "if it is administered with a zeal and a genuine concern to diminish death, injury and illness at the workplace in every possible way. .. ." (Wilcke 1971:71). By 1996, labor's hopes had turned to strident indictments of OSHA as it marked its 25th anniversary. These criticisms largely centered on the agency's failure to adopt more pro- * This paper was presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association.

New standards for only 23 substances are currently in effect, many of which are less protective than alternatives recommended by labor. ("New" health standards include only those regulations promulgated under Section 6(b) of the OSHAct and listed in the Code of Federal Regulations 1910, Subpart Z.) Class analytic theories, that provide the foundation for many recent studies of regulatory politics, suggest that the failure of agencies like OSHA reflects the privileged position of capital in the political arena (Gold, Lo and Wright 1975; Jones 1984; Offe 1975; Therborn 1978; see also Barnett 1988; McCaffrey 1982; Yeager 1987). Empirical research guided by this perspec- tive typically claims that agency "capture" and concerns about business confidence have con- sistently led OSHA officials to sacrifice health for profits (Calavita 1983; Noble 1986; Szasz 1984; Tolchin and Tolchin 1983; see also Bernstein 1955; Domhoff 1998; Edelman 1967; Pertschuk 1982 for similar arguments regarding other regulatory agencies). According to these studies, these two factors played a particularly important role in the "demise" of OSHA and other regulatory agencies under recent Republican administrations, as state officials main- tained a "revolving door" with capital and gave greater weight to cost-benefit analysis as part of a broader effort to bolster business confidence through "regulatory relief" (Calavita 1983; Noble 1986; Pertschuk 1982; Szasz 1986; see also Barnett 1988; Coleman 1998). This research offers important insights but simplifies the complex political processes that provide capital with advantages in the regulatory arena. Building on class analytic perspec- tives, we synthesize insights from critical legal studies and recent work in political sociology to further clarify the social bases of corporate power in the struggle against health and safety law.' Our synthesis focuses attention on the interplay of three factors that impede rulemaking: first, a legal framework that guarantees all parties, including capital, "due process" in standard- setting; second, the mobilization of strategic resources by corporate countermovements to exploit the opportunities afforded by due process; and third, the organizational constraints and institutional dynamics that limit the mobilization of labor and potential allies, including state technocrats, to defend regulatory initiatives. We examine the interplay of these factors using a sample of 25 rulemaking initiatives considered by OSHA from 1971 through 1996. The scope of our data set offers a unique opportunity to clarify historical trends across twenty-five years of regulatory conflicts. More importantly, we are able to trace the consequences of mobilization and countermobilization in one case for mobilization-countermobilization in other cases. In this way, we bring into focus a reality minimized in previous research: due process in standard-setting and the mobilization of capital to exploit this right necessarily create what we refer to as "opportunity costs" for labor, regardless of the political sympathies of those in power. These costs are most clearly reflected in hundreds of regulatory initiatives that remain dormant indefinitely. Research that overlooks the role of administrative due process and the mobilization-countermobilization dynamics that emerge in this context can not adequately explain these opportunity costs. Theoretical Framework Due Process and the Corporate Advantage Critical legal studies focus attention on the legal guarantees and rules that govern liberal democratic states and the way these work to the advantage of capital (see Milovanovic 1994). 1. We include under critical legal studies both those scholars who explicitly attach this label to their work as well as several who do not but offer similar interpretations of liberal democratic laws. We similarly draw across several tradi- tions in political sociology, including class analytic, political process/resource mobilization, and state-centered/organiza- tional perspectives.</page><page sequence="3">Politics of Social Regulation 593 The rights afforded by liberal democracies, although class neutral, advantage capital precisely because these guarantees treat all parties as though they were equal. Equal treatment before the law provides "procedural justice" at the expense of substantive justice in part due to resource disparities (see Cullen, Maakestad and Cavender 1987; Galanter 1974; Milovanovic 1994). From this perspective, "the more the rich and poor are dealt with according to the same legal propositions, the more the advantage of the rich is increased" (Ehrlich 1936:238, cited in Galanter 1974). For OSHA and other regulatory agencies, administrative due process is perhaps the most important legal guarantee that governs policymaking and, consistent with liberal democratic principles, is class neutral on its face. Due process in standard-setting provides "all interested parties" several rights (Mintz 1984). First, OSHA is obligated to hold public hearings and afford other opportunities for "public participation" before standards are finalized. The public hearings represent the most important venue for public participation, providing all interested parties the opportunity to present testimony and documentary evidence that supports or chal- lenges proposed standards. The OSHAct explicitly provides for only one exception to these rules; in cases of "grave danger," OSHA has the authority to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) that forces employers to immediately reduce exposure to a given substance, without providing a public hearing. Second, due process also guarantees any "aggrieved" party the right to judicial review of final standards; this forces the agency to demonstrate that the standard satisfies a number of criteria established through legislative intent and judicial interpretation of the Act. Third, due process in practice has resulted in a substance-by- substance approach to rulemaking, based on the assumption that only this approach provides all parties "adequate" opportunity to comment on the "unique" risks and regulatory concerns associated with particular hazards. In civil and criminal proceedings, due process is presumably guaranteed to "ensure that financially weak and politically powerless individuals [are] not crushed by the prosecutorial might of the state" (Braithwaite 1984:339). Due process in administrative proceedings simi- larly assumes that "aggrieved parties" must be protected against the "arbitrary and capricious" decisions of OSHA and other regulatory agencies (Mintz 1984). Critical legal scholars, how- ever, contend that due process protections, when extended to include corporations, necessar- ily benefit capital at the expense of substantive justice. Research in this vein focuses on the ways due process protects capital in the civil and criminal realm (Cullen, Maakestad and Cav- ender 1987; Galanter 1974). Scholars, for example, claim that due process has protected many firms from prosecution for white-collar crimes, given that prosecutors with limited resources have been unable to counter the technical and legal resources mobilized by capital in these cases (see Cullen, Maakestad and Cavender 1987). By exploiting due process guarantees, cap- ital has not only defended itself against particular civil and criminal charges but has also solidified its strategic advantage in two other ways. First, corporate litigants "play for rules as well as immediate gains" (Galanter 1974:100). In any given case, corporations are working, in part, to protect the rules governing the legal system while defending against legal precedents that might threaten their advantage. In fact, capital "may be willing to trade off tangible gain in any one case for rule gain" (Galanter 1974:101). Second, due process for capital necessarily creates what Galanter (1974) refers to as "chronic overload" for the courts, as the number of corporations fighting civil and criminal charges escalates beyond the capacity of the legal system (see also Yeager 1995). Mobilization and Countermobilization in the Policymaking Arena While their research provides important insights, critical legal scholars have not fully the- orized nor systematically examined the extent to which capital exploits due process in the policy making process to defend corporate profits and the rules that govern standard-setting in the reg- ulatory arena. Recent research in political sociology more adequately theorizes the dynamics</page><page sequence="4">594 WAHL/GUNKEL of mobilization and countermobilization in conflicts over policy initiatives that affect capital accumulation, including social regulation (Frank 1983; Jenkins and Brents 1989; Knoke 1990; Laumann, Knoke and Kim 1985; Quadagno 1984; Skocpol 1985; Yeager 1987). While much of this research agrees that a corporate advantage is to some extent "built into" political insti- tutions despite ostensibly neutral legal guarantees (e.g., Frank 1983; Yeager 1987), the liberal democratic state remains a "strategic terrain" for collective action (Jenkins and Brents 1989) as "governmental and nongovernmental organizations . . . struggle for power and legitimacy in the making of public policies" (Knoke 1990:188; see also Quadagno 1992).2 Consistent with critical legal studies, this work indicates that the mobilization of strategic resources is impor- tant to gain political leverage (see also Griffin, Wallace and Rubin 1986; Jenkins and Perrow 1977; Judkins 1983; McAdam 1982; Wallace 1987). The mobilization of scientific expertise may be particularly important in conflicts that emerge over social regulation given the "tech- nocratization" of law (Hawkins and Thomas 1989; Laumann, Knoke and Kim 1985; Stryker 1989; Yeager 1987, 1991). While the advantage potentially rests with capital, the mobilization of strategic resources by corporate actors in the policymaking arena is historically contingent. The "structure of polit- ical conflict" varies substantially across "policy domains," in part due to the diversity of orga- nizational interests across industries and firms (Laumann, Knoke and Kim 1985). In some cases, capital has acted in concert to defend class-wide interests (e.g., Griffin, Wallace and Rubin 1986), while in other cases political initiatives have divided corporations differentially affected by these proposals (Jenkins and Brents 1989; see also Useem 1980). Studies that map patterns of political conflict find that cleavages along class lines are more likely to emerge over labor policy than other issues (Salisbury et al. 1987) but research that focuses more squarely on the politics of regulation suggests that regulatory initiatives, unlike other labor policies, often create intraclass cleavages (Kolko 1963; Yeager 1991, 1995). Monopoly capital may actually have a vested interest in more stringent regulation as the economic costs can be easily absorbed by larger, more profitable firms while smaller firms, are forced out of business, fur- ther increasing the market share of surviving companies (Kolko 1963). Distinct organizational capacities may further contribute to distinct patterns of political mobilization across firms. At the national level, those corporate actors most strategically situated in "communication" and "resource" networks are most likely to participate in policymaking, as these networks facilitate communication with other organizations and provide greater access to expertise, money, and the like (Laumann, Knoke and Kim 1985). In the regulatory arena, large firms may be most strategically situated to participate in the political process given a greater stock of legal and technical experts (Yeager 1987). The mobilization of labor to defend policies that threaten capital accumulation similarly depends on interests and capacities that may vary across issues and time. For labor, mobiliza- tion is potentially limited by unique ideological obstacles as well organizational constraints. On the ideological front, labor has faced serious divisions created by "job blackmail" and the threat of plant closings in response to regulatory initiatives (Coleman 1998; Kazis and Gross- man 1982). Despite these threats, rank-and-file workers have become increasingly unwilling, at least at the bargaining table, to trade their health for job security (Noble 1986; Robinson 1988). While this ideological shift is important, labor faces serious organizational constraints that may limit its political capacities. Labor's economic resources, though substantial, are con- siderably more limited than those of capital. The precipitous decline in union membership and 2. Class analytic, political process, and state-centered/organizational perspectives all seem to agree on this point. All recognize that legal guarantees, institutional arrangements and other structural elements often give capital an advantage in the political arena. A central difference across these perspectives is the extent to which they attribute these limits to the actions and interests of capital and, relatedly, the degree of autonomy accorded state actors. Despite these dif- ferences, research in each tradition seems to have made mobilization and countermobilization dynamics a centerpiece of analysis.</page><page sequence="5">Politics of Social Regulation 595 union dues, the most important source of trade union revenues, has further exacerbated this disparity (Griffin, O'Connell and McCammon 1989; Knoke 1990). The technocratization of regulatory law may make these economic constraints a particularly serious obstacle to political mobilization. According to Yeager (1987:332), technocratization "may 'disenfranchise' con- cerned publics with too few resources to participate" in a decisionmaking process that has become increasingly technical. Survey data indicate that the pool of experts available to labor is, in fact, very limited. The total number of full-time health and safety experts employed by fifteen major unions had only reached 44 by 1983, despite a two-fold increase over the previ- ous decade (Noble 1986). Given these constraints, non-elites must typically forge alliances with "moral entrepre- neurs" and/or other "conscience constituents" to secure political victories that capital opposes (Jenkins and Perrow 1977; McAdam 1982; Wallace 1987). In the regulatory arena, environ- mentalists, public health organizations, and state technocrats are all potentially important allies. The extent to which state actors will mobilize to defend the interests of labor at the expense of capital remains a particularly important point of debate. Scholars who emphasize the class character of the state claim that labor cannot depend on the support of state techno- crats, as direct ties to regulated industries and rising concerns about business confidence limit the autonomy of these actors (Calavita 1983; Szasz 1986; Therborn 1978). Constrained by these factors, regulatory officials either fail to mobilize the expertise needed to defend regula- tory initiatives, or use scientific rationality to defend "compromise" initiatives that sacrifice health for capital accumulation. In contrast, state-centered perspectives claim that state officials are largely guided by a vested interest in expanding their own power and these inter - ests may lead them to back regulatory initiatives that favor labor at the expense of capital (Skocpol 1985; Skocpol and Finegold 1982). From this perspective, regulatory officials increasingly recruit, employ, and depend on scientific experts and scientific rationality to legit- imate a political agenda that runs counter to the interests of capital. Stryker provides a third perspective that claims that the role of state "technocrats" is his- torically contingent, circumscribed by "the relationships among agency actors, state actors outside the agency, and class actors outside the state" (1989:341). Research that focuses on the politics of regulation more fully specifies the complexities of the "internal" and "external" environments that might temper the role of state technocrats in policymaking (Hawkins and Thomas 1984, 1989). Agencies facing "powerful opponents"-including entrenched corporate interests-might give greater weight to economic factors than to scientific considerations, partic- ularly if obligated to do so by enabling legislation (Barnett 1988; Stryker 1989). The role of tech- nocrats may be further constrained by decisive "regime" shifts at the top levels of government and the entrenchment of regulatory ideologies that favor accommodation and compromise over protecting public interests (Barnett 1988; Harris and Milkis 1989). Pressure from above may interact with pressure from within regulatory agencies, as scientists may be forced into a process of bargaining with lawyers, economists, and other staff whose professional values, judgments, and commitments may differ considerably (Hawkins and Thomas 1989; Rabin 1989; Wilson 1980). "Turf wars" within agencies may be coupled with interagency conflicts such that agencies that might otherwise share similar statutory responsibilities fail to pool their expertise to achieve political objectives (Bowman 1984; Yeager 1993). Interagency conflict may be particularly debil- itating given that many of the "new" regulatory agencies have inadequate budgets and staff to meet their statutory obligations without the support of other agencies (Wilson 1980). Con- versely, this research suggests several conditions that might encourage state technocrats to act aggressively, including the consolidation of a regulatory culture committed to scientific rational- ity and the public interest, inter- and intra-agency cooperation, and the mobilization of broad- based coalitions favoring regulation (Barnett 1988; Hawkins and Thomas 1989). These debates about state technocrats and the technocratization of law are particularly relevant to the politics of health and safety. The OSHAct dictates that standard-setting be guided by scientific rationality and, consistent with this emphasis, created the National Insti-</page><page sequence="6">596 WAHL/ GUNKEL tute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to provide scientific evidence and expertise to OSHA. In addition, the agency may also draw from the expertise provided by in-house scien- tists, other regulatory agencies (e.g., EPA) and the academic community. At the same time, legal developments also require OSHA to assess the economic feasibility of standards, which may compromise the role of state technocrats and scientific rationality. This paper examines the mobilization of capital, labor, and their respective allies, includ- ing state actors, in conflicts over OSHA standards to address three broad questions raised by these debates and research. First, to what extent has capital mobilized as a class to exploit the opportunities created by administrative due process and, conversely, to what extent have labor and its potential allies, including state technocrats, mobilized to defend regulatory initia- tives despite organizational constraints? Second, what combination of indigenous resources and external allies do labor and capital depend on to advance their interests? Finally, what are the consequences of these mobilization-countermobilization processes for regulatory initia- tives? If due process favors capital as scholars contend, have regulatory initiatives been "watered down" and defeated because labor and state technocrats have failed to defend these standards-or has capital won this battle despite the mobilization of labor and its allies? Data and Methods The data used in this analysis are unique in several ways. Most importantly, we use a sam- ple of cases that is relatively broad in its scope.3 Past research has largely depended on a small number of cases to explore the politics of standard-setting (Kelman 1981; McCaffrey 1982; Mendeloff 1979). Recent work examining the participation of a broad range of corporate actors in more than 100 national "policy events" represents an important exception to these case studies but does not focus on health and safety law (Laumann, Knoke and Kim 1985). To provide both breadth and historical specificity, our sample includes 23 of the total 26 "sub- stance-specific" OSHA initiatives that advanced to the hearing stage between 1971 and 1996.4 In addition, we include two other important initiatives: a "generic" cancer policy intended to routinize and expedite the regulation of carcinogens and a "generic" air contaminants stan- dard intended to revise exposure limits for more than 400 substances. The full sample is listed in Table 1 in the order in which public hearings were held for these initiatives. Our analysis depends on both published and unpublished sources to analyze the political conflicts generated by these regulatory initiatives. The Federal Register (FR) and the Occupational Safety and Health Reporter (OSHR) are two particularly useful published sources (see Szasz 1984). In addition, we depend heavily on the dockets archived at OSHA's Technical Data Center. These dockets include all of the original documents collected during the rulemaking process for each initiative. 3. Two criteria guided sample selection. First, we limit the analysis to health standards and do not include safety standards, since health hazards are widely recognized as the greater threat and worker protection largely depends on industry actions (see Cullen, Maakestad and Cavender 1987:67-70). Second, we include only those initiatives for which public hearings actually have been held, given that these hearings are considered the centerpiece of administrative due process and the mobilization of capital, labor, and the state typically peaks at this stage. 4. The period covered by our sample takes us through the first four years of the Clinton administration, thereby allowing us to assess the importance of party politics relative to other factors. The three other substance-specific initia- tives that reached the hearing stage during this period but are not included in our analysis involve standards for MDA, bloodborne pathogens, and indoor air quality. The MDA standard was the first to be decided through a "negotiated" rulemaking process that differs substantially from the political process in which we are interested. Two days of public hearings were held subsequent to mediation, but the major issues that initially divided capital and labor had been resolved (e.g., the PEL). Similarly, the conflicts over bloodborne pathogens (i.e., HIV) and indoor air quality (i.e., ciga- rette smoke) are distinct because corporations are less clearly responsible for the hazards posed. Finally, we also exclude several remand hearings ordered by the courts unless these hearings involved a substantial reconsideration of the final standards (as in MOCA and asbestos).</page><page sequence="7">Table 1 * Resource Mobilization Disparities at OSHA Health Standard Hearings, 1971-1996 Capital and Labor Mobilization Advantageb Total Witnesses Expert Witnesses Lawyers State Agencies Percent of Total Percent of Experts (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) Casea CC LPH Ratio CC LPH Ratio CC LPH Total Experts CC LPH State CC LPH State Asbestos (1972) 29 18 1.61 9 12 .75 1t 1 5 4 56 35 10 36 48 16 Fourteen carcinogens (1973) 45 7 6.43 29 4 7.25 4t 1 1 1 85 13 2 85 12 3 Vinyl chloride (1974) 81 20 4.05 48 12 4.00 9t 1 15 13 70 17 13 67 15 18 Moca (1975) 26 2 13.00 20 0 20.00 0 0 15 13 76 6 18 87 0 13 Arsenic (1975) 34 7 4.86 20 4 5.00 5t 0 43 39 40 8 51 32 6 62 Coke ovens (1975) 45 55 .82 23 3 7.67 12t 2 35 32 33 41 26 40 5 55 Lead (1977) 74 127 .58 33 29 1.14 o10t 7 49 45 30 51 20 31 27 42 Cotton dust (1977) 220 56 3.93 38 9 4.22 9t 6 51 36 67 17 16 46 11 43 Sulfur dioxide (1977) 51 7 7.29 35 4 8.75 9 0 23 21 63 9 28 58 7 35 Benzene (1977) 52 18 2.89 43 9 4.78 4t 0 24 22 55 19 26 58 12 30 Beryllium (1977) 38 13 2.92 24 7 3.43 5 0 21 20 53 18 29 47 14 39 DBCP (1977) 8 5 1.60 4 3 1.33 1 0 22 19 23 14 63 15 12 73 Acrylonitrile (1978) 42 2 21.00 17 2 8.50 12 0 24 22 62 3 35 41 5 54 Generic cancer policy (1978) 251 49 5.12 124 13 9.69 12t 0 54 50 71 14 15 66 7 27 Ethylene oxide (1983) 40 23 1.74 33 16 2.06 3t 0 26 24 45 26 29 45 22 33 Asbestos (1984) 42 51 .82 28 24 1.17 4t 4 29 27 34 42 24 35 31 34 Benzene (1986) 32 18 1.78 16 12 1.38 5t 1 35 32 38 21 41 27 20 53 Formaldehyde (1986) 19 15 1.27 16 9 1.78 1t 1 25 23 32 25 42 33 20 47 Generic air contaminants (1988) 160 34 4.71 70 26 2.69 25t 1 41 32 68 15 17 55 20 25 Asbestos (1990) 29 6 4.83 18 4 4.50 4 0 14 13 59 12 29 51 11 37 Cadmium (1990) 44 3 14.67 23 2 11.50 7t 0 33 32 55 4 41 40 4 56 Butadiene (1991) 27 3 9.00 17 3 5.67 5 0 33 31 43 5 52 33 6 61 Asbestos (1991) 44 36 1.22 16 17 .94 8t 2 15 14 46 38 16 33 39 29 Methylene chloride (1992) 33 10 3.30 19 7 2.17 4t 0 32 31 44 13 43 33 12 54 Glycol ethers (1993) 6 3 2.00 4 3 1.33 1 0 21 19 20 10 70 15 12 73 Average across cases (N = 25) 59 24 4.86 29 9 4.86 6 1 27 24 51 19 30 44 15 40 Notes: CC = Corporate Countermovement; LPH = Labor-Public Health Coalition.

First, we trace the degree of intraclass unity and interclass conflict that developed in these cases. Second, we examine the extent to which capital and labor mobilized strategic resources and allies to exploit the opportunities provided by public hear- ings and judicial review. Third, we examine the short-term and long-term outcomes of these mobilization-countermobilization dynamics. Our analysis of resource mobilization focuses on three sets of resources in particular. Medical and technical experts play a pivotal role in public hearings given that debate typically centers on whether the scientific evidence warrants proposed regulations. Economic experts also are important because the law requires regulatory agencies to consider the economic fea- sibility of standards. Finally, the mobilization of legal experts may also be important given that all interested parties have the right to cross-examine witnesses and the right to judicial review. To tap theoretically important dimensions of resource mobilization, we pursue a multidimen- sional analysis. We examine the number of experts and lawyers mobilized in each case, the total number of witnesses mobilized, the breadth of participation, and the institutional affilia- tions of these witnesses.5 Given recent debates, we are particularly interested in tracing the mobilization of experts affiliated with OSHA, NIOSH, the EPA, and other regulatory agencies to support labor. The scope of our sample as well as these multidimensional measures provide several unique opportunities. We are able to trace historical trends in mobilization and countermobili- zation dynamics along several dimensions. Second, we bring into focus the consequences of resource mobilization and countermobilization in one case for subsequent cases. By providing this historical perspective, we more fully clarify the scope of the corporate advantage in the struggle against health and safety laws and, conversely, the obstacles facing labor. Below, we begin to examine these advantages and constraints by comparing the mobilization of capital and labor across twenty-five years of regulatory conflicts. Capital Against Labor: The Structure of Political Conflict in Historical Perspective Interclass Divisions and Intraclass Unity In the late 1960's, rank-and-file workers took to the streets while capital fought tena- ciously on Capitol Hill to block the Occupational Safety and Health Act (Donnelly 1982). This federal law institutionalized and routinized the conflict over health and safety but has not minimized the class divide. Rather than fostering cooperation and compromise, the divide between capital and labor has remained entrenched, perhaps because representatives of the corporate sector have mobilized against every health standard proposed by OSHA, even as they claim to be committed to worker health and safety. Corporate representatives profess a will- ingness to "assist OSHA in developing rational, practical and effective" policies but have repeatedly contested regulatory initiatives on scientific, economic, and legal grounds (OSHR 1977 [271:915). Industry witnesses contend that regulatory policies should be based on both "good science" and a definition of "socially acceptable risk" that balances "the desire to get 5. We emphasize the level of mobilization for several reasons. Knoke (1990:209) claims that the number of mem- bers mobilized for political action by organizations "is aimed at impressing public officials with the depth and intensity of a constituency's feelings. It is designed to convince politicians and bureaucrats that great risks are courted by daring to thwart the organization's interests." We believe that the number of witnesses recruited to participate in public hearings may operate in the same way. Second, both OSHA and the courts often make reference to the number of experts/wit- nesses who support a particular position to justify final decisions; this suggests that the level of mobilization is one of several factors that provide political leverage in these conflicts. In addition, previous research suggests that the level of resource mobilization in any one case may affect resource mobilization in other cases (see Galanter 1974).</page><page sequence="9">Politics of Social Regulation 599 things done and the desire to be safe" (OSHR 1978 [44]:1637). Harvard Professor Richard Wilson, testifying before OSHA in 1978, summarizes this position on behalf of capital: "Sci- entifically, we can reduce almost any exposure without limit, at increasing expense, but we cannot afford to spend the whole Gross National Product on one chemical alone" (OSHR 1978 [4]:87). Twenty years later, capital continues to make essentially the same claims (see OSHA H-71). Contrary to perspectives that emphasize intraclass differences in interests and capacities (Kolko 1963; Yeager 1987), these objections reflect industry-wide opposition to regulatory initiatives. In most cases, corporate resistance has been unanimous, at least among those rep- resentatives of capital who have participated in the public hearings. Notwithstanding the dif- ferential impact of these standards, the opposition has consistently included both large and small companies. The National Cotton Council, responding to the cotton dust standard, per- haps most clearly articulates the reasoning underlying class-wide opposition to regulatory initiatives: The proposed cotton dust standard's cost can be seen in better perspective when the interdepen- dence of all sectors of the cotton industry is considered. If OSHA's proposed dust standard is beyond the financial capability of one sector, it is beyond the capability of all, for no segment is dispensable. (OSHA H-052 Ex. 72b:47) In some cases, capital unanimously lines up against regulatory initiatives without necessarily forging class-wide unity. For example, the most economically vulnerable sectors have at times tried to convince regulatory officials that the "real problem" was occurring in the more stable industries, but such open attempts to "save oneself" represent the exception rather than the rule. Despite corporate resistance, organized labor has appeared at most every hearing to press for more protective standards. Although threatened with plant closings, representatives of labor typically stand unified against capital, at least in this public forum. In this context, labor leaders have emphasized the moral imperatives that drive unity in the face of corporate opposi- tion. "Occupational cancer is more than a subject for scientific conjecture, or elegant experi- mentation. . . . Occupational cancer is an every day threat. It is time to reduce the threat through rapid and effective regulation" (OSHR 1978 [23]:798). Union officials have repeatedly rejected the concept of socially acceptable risk, claiming this concept "may look neat on paper" but represents the "planned, coldly calculated sacrificing of workers" for profits (OSHR 1978 [7]:214). Building on this moral discourse, labor leaders emphasize their responsibility to the most vulnerable workers, in particular, as underscored in testimony by AFL-CIO officials: Today, as our members now begin to ... die from asbestos disease ... we continue our struggle to achieve reasonable . . . regulations from the federal government .... Neither EPA nor OSHA have acted to protect our members, many that our [sic] the least protected members in our society. Largely comprised of ethnic minority groups, new immigrants to our country, what economists refer to as the 'working poor'... (OSHA H-033 [1991] Tr.:1098-1099) While labor leaders commonly emphasize moral imperatives, the logic that motivates them to forge a united front in favor of more protective standards reflects a complex set of considerations. In some cases, rank-and-file pressure has spurred labor leaders to reject regu- latory alternatives that "sacrifice health for jobs." In other cases, economic and organizational considerations are also at work, as labor leaders have openly noted that their constituents- i.e., unionized workers-would be at a competitive disadvantage in the absence of federal standards that protect all workers (OSHA H-004). Resource Mobilization Whether motivated by economic, organizational or moral imperatives, intraclass unity does not necessarily translate into the effective mobilization of strategic resources to promote</page><page sequence="10">600 WAHL/GUNKEL class interests. Our analysis of resource mobilization uncovers a decisive corporate advantage over labor. In general, the mobilization of resources by capital dwarfs the mobilization of resources by labor across the 25 cases we examine. Table 1 provides several measures of this disparity. First, we compare the total number of witnesses mobilized by capital to the total number of witnesses mobilized by labor (columns 1-2). According to these figures, capital mobilized more witnesses than labor in all but three cases. In 13 cases, the corporate coun- termovement mobilized at least three times the number of witnesses mobilized by labor (col- umn 3). The extraordinary levels of mobilization generated by "generic" health standards is partic- ularly noteworthy, as this further clarifies the logic that motivates industry-wide resistance to regulatory initiatives. In part, this opposition reflects the broader scope of these standards. Both the generic cancer policy and the generic air contaminants policy targeted hundreds of hazardous substances used by many firms. Consistent with the expectations of critical legal scholars, however, opposition to these standards was motivated less by their immediate eco- nomic costs than by their precedent-setting implications for the rules governing standard- setting. Broadly stated, these rules threatened to replace the substance-by-substance approach to rulemaking with a more generic approach that would facilitate and expedite standard-setting. The generic cancer policy would force OSHA to automatically issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) once a substance was identified as a "Category I" carcinogen, without obligat- ing the agency to provide a public hearing. The air contaminants initiative would set new PELs for 428 substances en masse based on the recommendations of several scientific bodies (OSHA 1989). In both cases, corporate opponents coupled scientific and economic arguments with claims that these initiatives violated their right to due process (OSHA H-020). If the mobilization of experts is increasingly important as some suggest (Stryker 1989; Yeager 1991), the corporate advantage relative to labor along this dimension is particularly important. This advantage largely parallels capital's overall advantage, as indicated by the results reported in Table 1 (columns 4-6). According to these figures, capital mobilized more expert witnesses than labor in all but two cases and more than twice as many experts in 17 cases. As before, the generic cancer policy and the generic air contaminants standard drew record high levels of mobilization. In most cases, the disparity between capital and labor's expert witnesses is more pronounced than the overall disparity. Simply stated, the gap between capital and labor is most extreme with respect to those resources that may be most decisive in standard-setting. To compensate for the limited number of experts, labor has, on occasion, turned to rank- and-file workers. Labor registered the highest turnouts in precisely those hearings that drew large contingents of rank-and-file workers, namely coke oven emissions, lead, cotton dust, and asbestos (1984). In these cases, labor strategically used the rank-and-file testimony to broaden the debate over standards to include moral appeals and considerations, as testimony presented at the cotton dust hearings illustrates: My name is Eva Bradshaw. I am sixty-one years old and I have worked in the cotton mill as a spin- ner for forty-one years .... I went to work when I was 14'years old .... About ten years before I came out of the mill my chest was getting so tight and it feels that way today. Not only today but just about every day. It feels just like an accordian [sic] that has been closed down, like it is squeezed shut. I cough just about all the time, especially at work. And I finally got so short of breath that I couldn't hold out to teach Sunday school that I had taught for forty-two years. (OSHA H-052 Tr.:2182-2183) Though emotionally powerful, capital has routinely tried to impeach the credibility of non- credentialed witnesses, claiming that the law requires scientific and economic expertise be given more weight than "personal morality." While medical and economic experts may have become increasingly pivotal with the technocratization of law, capital also has mobilized legal experts to fully exploit the opportuni- ties provided by due process (see columns 7-8). Capital uses legal counsel to three strategic</page><page sequence="11">Politics of Social Regulation 601 ends. First, capital depends on legal experts to get evidence and testimony excluded from the record. Second, capital recruits lawyers to lead the cross-examination of witnesses, which both extends public hearings and challenges the credibility of witnesses and evidence, laying the basis for judicial review. In contrast, labor largely depends on union staff and medical experts to lead cross-examination. While perhaps persuasive on other fronts, these witnesses lack the training and expertise to exploit this opportunity as effectively as can lawyers (e.g., to exclude evidence). Finally, capital mobilizes corporate counsel to exploit the right to judicial review. As indicated in Table 1 (column 7), capital has legally challenged the majority of the regulatory initiatives included in our sample. Labor also has challenged many health stan- dards but largely to defend these against corporate opposition. In other words, labor has been forced to expend its own scarce resources to defend standards, rather than using these resources in more proactive ways. Indigenous Networks and External Allies These disparities, in large part, reflect the organizational capacities of the corporate coun- termovements that have organized against regulatory initiatives, and, conversely, the organi- zational constraints facing labor. More specifically, the corporate advantage in most cases reflects the organizational capacities of the Fortune 500 companies (Fortune 1977) and lead- ing trade associations, which have spearheaded opposition to regulatory initiatives (see Table 2). Trade associations act as a particularly important vehicle for pooling resources and coordi- nating class-wide action. To maximize their organizational capacities, several firms and trade associations have not only exploited existing organizational structures but also created new institutions to coordinate the opposition. These new institutions typically take the form of "steering committees" and special task forces that undertake three strategic tasks: first, they work to forge a consensus among industries and competing firms; second, they develop "posi- tion papers" laying out the regulatory options capital "can live with"; and third, they draw together experts to build their case. The work of the National Cotton Council (NCC) in the cotton dust case reflects the typical role of these steering committees. As a strategic first step, the NCC created the "Industry-Wide Byssinosis Committee" to coordinate a countermove- ment that mobilized both large and small firms from all sectors of the cotton producing indus- try. This committee then organized a "special session on cotton dust" that drew together scientists from the private sector, the state, universities, and several think tanks to share infor- mation and develop a consensus on the proposed cotton dust standard. In other cases, steering committees have been similarly organized to build consensus and coordinate class-wide action. Working through these and other organizational vehicles, capital has effectively tapped both in-house networks and external links to recruit witnesses for the public hearings. The mobilization of expert witnesses, in particular, reflects the importance of both networks. Capital routinely calls on corporate medical directors and other in-house experts to testify against health standards. In addition, capital also recruits experts from leading universities and think tanks as well as reputable economic firms. Though they seldom outnumber "company doctors," university scientists represent a particularly strategic resource given that they lend the appear- ance of objectivity to scientific claims that the risks posed by given hazards are not significant. One other organizational dynamic permits capital to mobilize more witnesses than labor in most cases. Simply stated, certain firms and trade associations may lead the opposition, but the task of mobilizing witnesses has been broadly shared in each case. This is indicated perhaps most clearly by the number of firms and trade associations that participated in the public hearings (see Table 2). On average, the corporate opposition has been represented by 22 firms and trade associations. The record highs for cotton dust, the generic cancer policy, and air contaminants perhaps most clearly reveal the advantages gained when many organizations share the task of recruiting witnesses.</page><page sequence="12">602 WAHL/GUNKEL Table 2 * Profile of the Corporate Opposition to Regulatory Initiatives, 1971-1996 Case Leading Corporate Opponentsa Asbestos 1972 (N = 21)b Johns Manville Armstrong Cork Co Asbestos Information Assn Raybestos Manhatten Fourteen Carcinogens (N = 17) Dow Chemical Rubber Manufacturers Assn Vinyl Chloride (N = 34) SPI with MCA Plastics Co MOCA (N = 18) Firestone Tire and Rubber Polyurethane Manufacturers Assn Arsenic (N = 10) ASARCO Anaconda Coke Oven Emissions (N = 8) AISI Republic Steel Corporation Lead (N = 31) Battery Council International Lead Industries Assn ASARCO AISI Cotton Dust (N = 119) ATMI National Cotton Council Sulfur Dioxide (N = 18) Smelter Group Corn Refiners Assn Virginia Chemicals Benzene (N = 7) American Petroleum Institute AISI Beryllium (N = 15) Brush Wellman Kawecki Berylco Industries DBCP (N = 2) Shell Oil South Carolina Peach Council and Promotion Board Acrylonitrile (N = 11) Society of the Plastics Industry Vistron Generic Cancer Policy (N = 81) American Industrial Health Council American Petroleum Institute Ethylene Oxide (N = 11) Ethylene Oxide Industry Council American Hospital Assn Asbestos 1984 (N = 10) Asbestos Information Assn RT Vanderbilt Co Benzene 1986 (N = 8) American Petroleum Institute Chemical Manufacturers Assn American Iron and Steel Formaldehyde (N = 3) Formaldehyde Institute DuPont Generic Policy on Air Inter Industry Wood Dust Coordinating Committee Contaminants (N = 63) Chemical Manufacturers Association Asbestos 1990 (N = 9) National Stone Assn National Ready Mix Concrete Assn Cadmium (N = 12) Cadmium Council Dry Color Manufacturers Assn Butadiene (N = 5) Chemical Manufacturers Assn International Institute of Synthetic Rubber Producers Asbestos 1991 (N = 14) Resilient Floor Covering Institute Union Carbide Methylene Chloride (N = 14) Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance Eastman Kodak Co Glycol Ethers (N = 1) Chemical Manufacturers Assn a To determine the leading opponents, we rank-ordered corporate opponents in terms of the number of witnesses each mobilized.

First, the task of building a case for more protective standards falls on a handful of labor unions. At one level, this seems inevitable because a few unions at most typi- cally represent workers in any given industry. At another level, however, labor could compen- sate for this organizational problem by forging alliances with public interest groups and professional societies that share an interest in public health. To some extent organized labor has drawn support from four distinct categories of potential allies: environmental groups, women's groups, consumer advocates, and professional societies. In general, however, the support pro- vided by these organizations has been extremely limited. Of the public interest groups that par- ticipated in public hearings, Ralph Nader's Public Citizen's Health Research Group (HRG) has been labor's most dependable ally, appearing in 12 cases. In contrast, no other public interest group has appeared more than twice. The failure of professional associations to appear more consistently on behalf of labor is perhaps most striking given their resources. The American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the American Thoracic Society, and the Amer- ican Public Health Association among others have appeared in only one or two hearings. Simi- larly, organized labor seems to have forged few alliances with university experts or think tanks. The Mt. Sinai School of Medicine has proven its most dependable ally, appearing in 11 cases. In most cases, however, neither organized labor nor its interest group allies have recruited more than one or two university experts to represent their case.6 The resulting constraints labor faces are perhaps most dramatically reflected in the analy- sis presented in Table 3 which provides several aggregate measures of resource mobilization across the twenty-five hearings included in our sample. Since 1971, a total of 1298 individuals, including 610 experts, appeared on behalf of capital at these hearings. The pool of witnesses recruited by labor pales in comparison. During this period, labor recruited only 470 individu- als; a mere 145 were experts. Perhaps more telling is evidence that labor significantly more often than capital repeatedly relied on the same experts to represent its position. Only 14.6 per- cent of the experts who have testified on behalf of capital appeared at two or more hearings. In contrast, 26.2 percent of the experts recruited by labor appeared at more than one hearing as organized labor returned again and again to the same scientists, industrial hygienists, physi- cians, and other credentialed experts to make its case. The burden these experts face relative to experts recruited by capital is further indicated by the extent to which they have been called on to appear at five or more hearings. Only 1.1 percent of the experts who testified more than once for capital appeared this often. In contrast, 21 percent of the witnesses called on more than once by labor have appeared in five or more hearings, further suggesting that the pool of witnesses available to labor has been easily exhausted forcing a small group of in-house indus- trial hygienists and university experts to repeatedly bear the burden of representing workers.7 This evidence resolves an important question raised in past research. In the conflict over 6. Previous research suggests that structural ties to the corporate sector may, in part, explain why labor has recruited so few allies from the public interest sector and universities. Wysong (1992), for example, claims that the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Occupational Medical Association (AOMA), the American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE), as well as other professional associations and public interest groups that presumably share a public health agenda are actually beholden to corporate interests. Many depend heavily on the private sector for fund- ing and often draw their membership and governing boards largely from industry ranks. Given these linkages, these organizations may directly oppose or remain neutral toward health and safety initiatives, as did the AMA, the AOMA, and the ASSE, in response to the High Risk Occupational Disease Notification and Prevention Act in the mid-1980s. Similarly, academics with purported health and safety concerns may also be wary of gaining pro-labor and anti-capital reputations for fear of losing corporate funding (Shenk 1999). 7. This interpretation provides an important alternative to Galanter's (1974) expectations regarding "repeat players." Galanter suggests that parties repeatedly involved in a similar class of civil and/or criminal litigation gain several strategic advantages over "one-shotters." Most importantly, experience provides a level of expertise that one-shotters simply do not have. While experience may also provide an important advantage in administrative proceedings, we suggest there is a point of diminishing returns. Regardless of the edge gained by experienced witnesses, a tendency to repeatedly depend on the same witnesses necessarily limits the number of cases in which parties can effectively participate.</page><page sequence="14">604 WAHL/ GUNKEL Table 3 * Constraints on Pool of Witnesses Available to Capital, Labor, and OSHA/NIOSH, 1971-1996 Measures of Constraints Capital Labor OSHA/NIOSH Pool of witnesses Total number of individual witnesses appearing 1298 470 400 Number of individual experts appearing 610 145 369 Multiple appearances among experts Percent of experts appearing at two or more hearings 14.6% 26.2%* 24.9%t Among experts making multiple appearances Experts appearing at two hearings 71.9% 55.3% 55.4% Experts appearing at three hearings 24.7% 18.4% 23.9% Experts appearing at four hearings 2.2% 5.3% 9.8% Experts appearing at five or more hearings 1.1% 21.0% 11.0% Total 100% 100% 100% (n = 89) (n = 38) (n = 92) * Capital and labor by one/two or more hearings: Chi-square = 11.299, df = 1, p = .001 (two-sided). tCapital and OSHA/NIOSH by one/two or more hearings: Chi-square = 16.318, df = 1, p = .000 (two-sided). health and safety, the labor-public health coalition has largely failed on its own to counter the mobilization of strategic resources by capital. Organized labor formed few alliances with public interest groups, instead depending heavily on a small pool of in-house experts to testify in favor of more protective standards. While the role of these "moral entrepreneurs" is impor- tant, labor's dependence on only a handful of individuals necessarily limits the number of bat- tles to which it can fully commit at any given time. Conversely, the corporate sector can more easily mobilize again and again to challenge health standards as long as this task is widely shared and a relatively unlimited pool of experts is available. Notwithstanding these disparities, our analysis reveals a "window of opportunity" for labor in recent years, despite limited resources and allies. This opportunity is the result of an unanticipated downward trend in the absolute level of resource mobilization by capital, as indicated by Figure 1. From 1972 to 1977, corporate resistance to regulatory initiatives esca- lated. After the cotton dust case, however, this opposition gradually declined with only two notable exceptions (i.e., the generic cancer policy and air contaminants standard). Despite this decline, capital was able to maintain its "mobilization advantage" because labor and its allies failed to increase their efforts. Rather, the mobilization of the labor-public health coalition also declined, dropping to record lows in the 1990's. This dramatic decline is particularly significant if the defense of more protective standards depends solely on the labor-public health coalition. If previous class analytic interpretations are correct, labor has, in fact, been on its own, particularly during recent Republican adminis- trations. If, however, state-centered theories apply, labor may increasingly be able to count on state technocrats to actively fight for more protective standards, notwithstanding party politics at higher levels. As demonstrated below, neither perspective adequately explains the complex role of regulatory officials and state technocrats in the political conflicts over health standards. The Mobilization of Regulatory Agencies and State Technocrats in Historical Perspective At first glance, the role of state agencies in the conflict over health standards seems mixed (see Table 1). On the one hand, the mobilization of state actors has failed to strip capital of its overall advantage at the hearing stage. In 13 cases, capital's share of the total number of wit-</page><page sequence="15">Politics of Social Regulation 605 220 251 160 140 127 120 100 1 81 S80 7 60 55 56 51 52 51 45 4542 44 44 38 36 0 40 34 32 29 26 29 27 18 20 18019 20y= -4.5697x + 106.63 y= -2.4456x + 49.667 ?400 ?Capital Labor - Capital: Mobilization Trend -------Labor: Mobilization Trend y= -4.5697x + 106.63 y= -2.4456x + 49.667 Figure 1 * Historical Trends in the Mobilization of Hearing Witnesses by Capital and Labor, 1971- 1996. To graphically emphasize theoretically important comparisons, we set the upper limit for the y-axis at 150 rather than 251 so that the extremes in resource mobilization do not obscure the differences among other cases. Further, we calculate linear trends in resource mobilization to emphasize important turning points. The trend line for capital is calculated to reflect the dedine from cotton dust thru glycol ethers (i.e., excluding previous cases). The trend line for labor is calculated to reflect the decline from lead thru glycol ethers (i.e., excluding previous cases). nesses remained greater than 50 percent (see columns 11-13). On the other hand, the mobili- zation of experts by regulatory agencies does seem to compensate for labor's constraints in most of these cases (see columns 14-16). Specifically, the share of experts mobilized by state agencies when added to the share of experts mobilized by labor gives these parties an advan- tage over capital in all but eight cases. If, however, we explore the mobilization of regulatory agencies more closely, our analysis indicates that they have not proven dependable allies for labor, even during Democratic admin- istrations. This conclusion rests on several measures. First, we find that labor consistently has been forced to resort to lawsuits and formal petitions to prod regulatory officials to act on their behalf. OSHA's failure to act autonomously on behalf of labor is perhaps most readily appar- ent. In fully 13 cases, the agency has failed to schedule rulemaking hearings until sued or for-</page><page sequence="16">606 WAHL/GUNKEL mally petitioned by labor. (This figure is based on a comparison of the timing of lawsuits and petitions by labor and the publication of hearing notices by OSHA in the Federal Register.) Ref- erence to these lawsuits and petitions during the public hearings lays bare the agency's failure to act as a dependable ally. In 1991, union officials opened their testimony at the fourth round of hearings on asbestos with an indictment repeated at other hearings: The present administrative proceeding is finally taking place, not because of, but in spite of, the policy- makers within these government offices.... Let there be no mistake about it: Those policy officials in OSHA and elsewhere in the Executive Branch of our government who have caused these delays and have resisted efforts to strengthen the standard are responsible for the premature deaths, the cancers and the other agonizing diseases . . which will predictably occur. (OSHA H-033 [19911:622-624) To some extent, OSHA officials have invoked scientific rationality to justify what labor leaders label "institutional footdragging," claiming the data available are not adequate to establish that these substances pose a significant risk to workers. In most cases, however, rec- ommendations made by the agency's own experts motivate labor's petitions; labor typically petitions OSHA for more protective standards following the submission of NIOSH reports that either explicitly recommend lower limits for given substances or, at minimum, urge a "recon- sideration" of existing standards.8 OSHA's failure to expeditiously follow up on these recom- mendations indicates, as suggested earlier, that "political considerations" limit the role of technocrats and the technocratization of law, at least in the initial stages of rulemaking. More specifically, technocrats may assist OSHA in the development of standards, but the scientific evidence and opinions provided by these technocrats consistently are disregarded until labor mobilizes to prompt rulemaking. While NIOSH often provides the scientific evidence that spurs the mobilization of labor, in some cases this agency has also "done nothing" until prompted by labor. The benzene case provides but one example of "institutional footdragging" at NIOSH. According to Peter Bom- marito, President of the URW, NIOSH urged OSHA to adopt a more protective standard in this case "only after we asked for direct and immediate action from the director [of the agency], Dr. John Finklea" (OSHR 1976 [14]:398). The organizational dynamics underlying this reluc- tance to act autonomously are problematic at several levels (see Hawkins and Thomas 1984). From a resource mobilization perspective, one of the most serious consequences is that it forces labor to devote scarce resources to pursuing legal action against regulatory agencies, thereby limiting the resources available for other battles. Our analysis indicates that labor similarly can not count on state technocrats for support once rulemaking is initiated. NIOSH experts, in particular, seem to represent an especially weak link among the technocrats who appear at the public hearings. In the most extreme cases, NIOSH scientists have crossed over to support capital rather than labor. In the coke ovens case, for example, a high ranking NIOSH official who chaired the "Industry-NIOSH Technical Liaison Committee on Polycyclic Organic Matter" testified against the coke ovens standard over the objections of labor (OSHR 1975 [23]: 800). In 1990, this scenario was repeated as R. T. Vanderbilt recruited several scientists formerly at NIOSH to testify against a more protective asbestos standard. Similarly, NIOSH demonstrates a willingness to endorse "compromise" standards rather than the more protective alternatives advocated by labor. Specifically, NIOSH has often endorsed initiatives proposed by OSHA despite expert testimony and evidence indicating these proposals do not adequately protect workers. In some cases, NIOSH has admitted that its position compromises scientific and medical considerations. As recently as 1990, for example, NIOSH endorsed the proposed PEL for cadmium rather than 8. To make this determination, we compare the timing of NIOSH recommendations, including both criteria docu- ments and current intelligence bulletins, and the timing of labor's petitions, drawing this information from the Federal Register as well as the NIOSH Criteria Documents Plus CD ROM.</page><page sequence="17">Politics of Social Regulation 607 the lower limits advocated by labor although the agency acknowledged: "Even at the [pro- posed] levels [PEL], the level of excess cancer deaths estimated by OSHA would still be exces- sive" (OSHA H-057 Tr.:8-55). Other experts mobilized by state agencies have been less willing to compromise their sci- entific judgment for political considerations, at least once they decide to appear at the public hearings. Expert witnesses from the EPA, for example, have consistently supported labor's call for standards that are more protective than those proposed by OSHA. Experts from California's OSHA (Cal OSHA) program similarly have testified in favor of more protective standards than those proposed when they appear at the public hearings, and many university experts invited by OSHA to testify have similarly endorsed more protective standards than those proposed. However, our analysis indicates that this support for labor is limited in two important ways. First, we find that interagency cooperation is the exception rather than the rule. Neither the EPA, Cal OSHA, the National Cancer Institute, nor any other state agency that may repre- sent a "natural ally" to labor has consistently joined OSHA and NIOSH at the public hearings. The NCI and the EPA lead this group of potential allies, but neither participated in more than seven hearings. No other agency appeared more than three times. The significafice of these absences has not escaped either labor leaders or the rank-and-file. In the cotton dust case, for example, several rank-and-file workers indicted South Carolina's Commissioner of Labor for failing to appear at the public hearings: We met with the Commissioner... [he] told us ... that he would be testifying at these hearings, but we look on the schedule, and he's not on it. I guess he is really scared about what the textiles might do to him in the State legislature .... He told us that he had the power to clean up the mill, but if he used it, the textile companies would see that his department budget got cut. He can't do nothing [sic] because the textiles are so powerful in South Carolina. (OSHA H-052 Tr.:2150-2151) A historical perspective further clarifies the extent to which these and other organizational dynamics limit the support provided by regulatory agencies. Contrary to state-centered perspec- tives, we find that the mobilization of expert witnesses by regulatory agencies has essentially "flatlined" after a gradual increase in the early years.9 State agencies have collectively recruited, on average, only 24 expert witnesses to testify in each case (see Table 1, column 10). More importantly, regulatory officials have not substantially increased or decreased their mobilization efforts, regardless of the extent to which capital mobilizes against proposed standards. Further, this leveling effect emerged midway through the Carter Administration, rather than during the Reagan years, and persisted into the first four years of the Clinton administration. The persis- tence of this trend across administrations suggests an interesting organizational dynamic not fully recognized in previous research that treats party politics as decisive. In general, the mobili- zation of expert witnesses by regulatory agencies seems constrained by a degree of routinization and predictability that runs counter to the kinds of strategic action that may be necessary in the face of corporate opposition. More specifically, this routinization suggests a failure by OSHA, NIOSH and other agencies to engage in tactical adaptation when corporate resistance escalates. The organizational constraints and routinization which limit the stfategic mobilization of these agencies is further reflected in the measures provided by Table 3. Like labor, OSHA and NIOSH have more often than capital repeatedly relied on the same experts to testify at multi- ple public hearings. Specifically, 24.9 percent of the experts recruited to testify for these agen- cies have appeared at more than one hearing; of these, 11 percent appeared at five or more hearings. As was the case for labor, the burden of representing these agencies seems to fall heavily on a small core of individuals. 9. We make this determination by estimating the linear trend line for the number of experts mobilized by state agencies, beginning with the cotton dust case (see Table 1, col. 10). The intercept for this line is 27.529 and the slope is close to zero (-.161).</page><page sequence="18">608 WAHL / GUNKEL At the same time that organizational constraints limit the extent to which labor can count on its presumed "natural allies," our analysis uncovers several state agencies that appear to be "natural allies" for capital. Specifically, the Bureau of Mines (USBM), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Council on Wage and Price Stability (COWPS) periodically appeared at the public hearings to defend capital accumulation against regulatory initiatives. The role COWPS has been noted in past research (see Noble 1986) but the role of the USBM and USDA largely is ignored. The testimony of both agencies indicates that their opposition to more protective standards parallels the opposition typically mobilized by COWPS. Importantly, both the USDA and the USBM drew from their pool of in-house experts to legitimate this opposition. Below, we examine the short and long-term consequences of these mobilization and countermobilization dynamics. Victories for Capital and Opportunity Costs for Labor in Historical Perspective Consistent with previous class analytic research, we conclude that the record of wins and losses in the conflicts over health standards favors capital accumulation at the expense of labor. The integration of critical legal studies and recent work in political sociology, however, adds unique insights to the gains made by capital. In general, due process coupled with disparities in resource mobilization result in case-specific gains for capital, as well as several more far-reaching victories. Most (14) of the standards finalized by OSHA either make significant concessions to capital or represent compromises (see Table 4, panel 1). In seven cases, we consider the final standard a decisive victory for capital; in another seven cases the final standard represents a "draw." Through judicial review, capital secured additional gains in seven cases. While these outcomes undoubtedly reflect a combination of conditions, our results suggest that resource mobilization does provide a measure of political leverage in the struggle against regulatory ini- tiatives. In those rulemaking cases that were finalized, capital typically was able to convert its advantage in the mobilization of witnesses into either a regulatory or an appellate victory. These gains are less important than the far-reaching consequences of this mobilization. As in the civil and criminal realm (Galanter 1974), capital secured at least two broader victories in the arena of regulatory rulemaking. On the one hand, the corporate sector successfully defended the rules that govern standard-setting so as to protect the opportunities afforded by due process and "normal" rulemaking procedures. More specifically, capital secured these rules with the defeat of the two generic standards proposed by OSHA. In its final form, the generic cancer policy did not force OSHA to immediately issue an ETS for all "confirmed" carcinogens without providing a public hearing as initially proposed. Capital explicitly invoked the princi- ple of due process to challenge this provision. According to the American Industrial Health Council, "the general public will certainly not benefit from the conduct of rulemaking pro- ceedings that deprive parties of due process of law" (OSHR 1980 [45]:1051). The air contami- nants standard, adopted in 1989, to some extent compensated for this defeat by lowering the PELs for over 300 substances without conducting separate rulemaking hearings for each sub- stance. However, the court overturned the final standard in its entirety, reaffirming the substance-by-substance approach to rulemaking that capital claims is the cornerstone of administrative due process (AFL-CIO v. OSHA 965 F. 2d 962).'0 10. Importantly, the court rejected the claim that the air contaminants standard and generic rulemaking, more generally, violate the principle of due process (AFL-CIO v. OSHA 965 F. 2d 962). Instead, the court ruled that the stan- dard did not meet the significant risk test established by the Supreme Court in the benzene decision. In short, the court invoked "scientific rationality" to set limits on the adoption of generic standards that favor labor. While generic stan- dard-setting in principle was not ruled a violation of due process, OSHA returned to the substance-by-substance approach to rulemaking.</page><page sequence="19">Politics of Social Regulation 609 Table 4 * Victories for Capital and Opportunity Costs for Labor and OSHA, 1971-1996 Panel 1.

On the other hand, the mobilization of capital to exploit the public hearings, judicial review and the principle of due process had a second set of far-reaching consequences that further solidify its strategic advantage: it imposes on labor and the state what we label "oppor- tunity costs" on labor and the state. The mobilization of a corporate countermovement in any</page><page sequence="20">610 WAHL/GUNKEL one case limits the mobilization of labor and the state in other cases. This may explain why so many regulatory initiatives are never finalized (see Table 4, panel 2). In other words, many standards have remained dormant because corporate opposition to other standards largely exhausted the resources available to labor and the state. For example, the corporate counter- movements organized against the coke ovens, lead, and cotton dust standards forced labor and regulatory agencies to allocate all their resources to defending these standards, foregoing an organized defense of other regulatory initiatives. While largely overlooked by past research, labor and its allies are keenly aware of these opportunity costs. In Congressional hearings, the Public Health Research Group and other lib- eral advocacy groups have explicitly cited a lack of resources for their failure to mobilize in defense of a broad range of regulatory initiatives (U.S. Senate 1976). According to Senator Edward Kennedy, "When citizens do participate in agency proceedings they can make significant contributions but in all too many cases their potential contributions are lost due to their inability to pay the high costs of attorney's fees and expert witness fees necessary for such participation" (U.S. Senate 1976:235-236). As a result of these high costs and limited resources, the number of rulemaking proceedings in which labor and its allies, including state technocrats, can effectively participate is necessarily finite, particularly given the tendency to depend heavily on the same experts to appear in hearing after hearing. These resource con- straints make it especially difficult to participate in several rulemakings simultaneously, which further explains why so few regulatory initiatives have been finalized. In recent years, the number of standards that remain dormant indefinitely has escalated. The court's decision to overturn the air contaminants standard, perhaps more than any other recent development, struck a decisive blow against the agency's efforts to catch up with the backlog in standard-setting. In addition, this decision made more visible the opportunity costs that result when capital mobilizes against regulatory initiatives. By pursuing legal action as a class, capital safeguarded the substance-by-substance approach to standard-setting and thereby indefinitely delayed rulemaking for hundreds of hazardous substances. In their defense of the air contaminants standard, OSHA explicitly noted the opportunity costs that necessarily follow from substance-by-substance rulemaking: "Under past approaches and prac- tices, OSHA could continue to regulate a small number of high priority substances and those of greatest public interest. However, it would take decades to review currently used chemicals and OSHA would never be able to keep up with the many chemicals that will be newly intro- duced in the future" (FR 1989:20963). The court's decision overturning the air contaminants standard has had precisely this effect. In 1996, the agency resumed the substance-by- substance approach to rulemaking for 20 high priority hazards but anticipated that these stan- dards would not be completed for at least a decade (OSHR 1996 [38]). Consistent with our perspective, the number of rulemakings the agency can conduct is necessarily finite and many standards will remain dormant indefinitely as long as resources remain limited and the prin- ciple of due process affords capital the right to contest standards on a case-by-case basis. Bar- ring the completion of these standards, thousands of workers will continue to die from preventable diseases. Conclusions This paper reconsiders a long-standing concern among political sociologists and legal scholars: the failure of regulatory agencies like OSHA. Our empirical and theoretical extension of past research further clarifies the legal guarantees, organizational factors, and institutional dynamics that provide capital with an advantage in the struggle against health and safety laws. The empirical analysis maps the "structure of political conflicts" with greater specificity than previous large-scale studies of policymaking. At the same time, we capture the scope of the corporate advantage and the constraints facing labor and its potential allies more ade-</page><page sequence="21">Politics of Social Regulation 611 quately than do case studies. Drawing from critical legal studies and recent work in political sociology, we also theorize more fully the structurally embedded sources of corporate power in liberal democratic states. The corporate advantage is most clearly reflected in the "opportunity costs" we bring into focus. Capital may have lost some "skirmishes" against health and safety initiatives, but has largely won the war. We cannot adequately explain this outcome unless we acknowledge the importance of both due process and resource mobilization. Due process provides important opportunities to challenge regulatory initiatives and capital consistently exploits these opportuni- ties by forging intraclass unity and pooling strategic resources. As suggested by critical legal studies, corporate resistance to regulatory initiatives peaks when these initiatives threaten to limit the opportunities provided by due process. As suggested by Galanter (1974), capital has "played for rules" and, in so doing, safeguarded procedural justice at the expense of substantive justice. If class-neutral legal guarantees work to the advantage of capital in this case, it is in part due to the organizational constraints and institutional dynamics that limit the mobilization of labor and state technocrats to defend regulatory initiatives. Despite the threat of plant closings, union officials consistently press for more protective standards but limited organizational capacities make it difficult for labor, on its own, to match the resources mobilized by capital. Labor is forced to depend on public interest groups and state technocrats but neither has proven a dependable ally. The limited support provided by state technocrats represents a particularly important finding given recent debates between state-centered and class analytic scholars. Lim- ited resources, a lack of interagency cooperation, and concerns about business confidence work together to compromise this support. The pattern of routinization and predictability we uncover further provides capital with a "built in" advantage in the struggle over health and safety law. These organizational constraints must be acknowledged if we are to fully understand why due process necessarily leads to opportunity costs in the regulatory arena. Given organiza- tional constraints, the resources available to labor and regulatory agencies are easily exhausted when the law allows all interested parties the opportunity to contest regulatory ini- tiatives and capital routinely exploits this opportunity. In short, due process for capital imposes a burden on labor and the state analogous to the "chronic overload" created by cor- porate challenges in the civil and criminal courts. This overload and the related opportunity costs are inevitable as long as due process in standard-setting is guaranteed, regardless of whether representatives of industry "capture" regulatory agencies. Our research suggests several reforms that would minimize the corporate advantage in the regulatory arena. On the one hand, reforms that minimize resource disparities would, to some extent, create a more level playing field in the conflict over health standards. A more "radical" strategy is suggested by critical legal scholars who urge that we limit capital's right to due process (Galanter 1974). Braithwaite (1984:339), for example, argues, "The tendency automatically to attribute traditional rights and due process protections to corporations simply because they are available to individuals is legal anthropomorphism at its worst. . . . The extreme privations suffered by individual victims of state oppression which justify extreme protections of individual rights are not felt within corporations." We believe the same critique applies to the rules governing standard-setting. Administrative due process, though seemingly class neutral, necessarily shifts the advantage to capital at the expense of workers. If we curtail due process in standard-setting, what kind of policymaking process remains? Stryker's work suggests a two-fold alternative long endorsed by labor. First, scientific rational- ity rather than legal principles should guide standard-setting (see also Milovanovic's 1994: 184) proposals regarding "alternative definitions of harm" and "creative legal change strate- gies"). Second, "independent scientific bodies" like the National Cancer Institute should be charged with the authority to oversee the standard-setting process. Theoretically, this form of technocratization should considerably expedite rulemaking because it would make the recom- mendations of these scientists binding. In other words, technocratization in this form would force regulatory agencies like OSHA to reduce permissible exposure limits for a particular sub-</page><page sequence="22">612 WAHL/GUNKEL stance once it had been identified as a carcinogen, with no statutory obligation to consider industry objections. Consistent with Stryker's theory, however, we believe that class relations external to the state set limits on the technocratization of law to the extent that it threatens capital accumulation. Our analysis makes clear the specific legal principles that are used to impose these limits. In the case of OSHA, the principle of administrative due process has served this purpose. Congress and the courts, of course, concede that science and scientists should play a pivotal role in standard-setting but not to the exclusion of "public participation." In short, the principle of due process is used as a shield against those forms of technocratiza- tion that most seriously threaten the interests of capital. Notwithstanding these legal constraints, this paper suggests several opportunities that labor failed to effectively seize. The downward trend in corporate opposition to regulatory ini- tiatives provides one such opportunity. Labor's failure to take advantage of this opportunity raises several important questions that deserve further consideration. Why has labor failed to mobilize its "natural allies" to fully exploit this opportunity? More accurately, why have those social movement organizations, professional societies, and university experts who presumably share a public health agenda largely left labor to fend for itself? This paper offers only partial explanations. While we cannot dismiss the importance of ideological rifts, this analysis sug- gests several other possibilities. First, labor leaders may have fallen into the same kind of rou- tinization evident at OSHA and NIOSH, failing to actively cultivate a broad set of allies, recruit effectively from the public interest sector, and respond strategically to corporate resistance. Second, resource constraints may limit the support public interest groups can provide. Like labor, many public interest groups have limited resources, easily exhausted by the many struggles in which they engage for their own particular set of interests-i.e., environment, reproductive health, and the like. Finally, many professional societies and university experts with a public health agenda depend on capital for funding as well as other resources that, in turn, may compromise their willingness and freedom to act as allies for labor. Given these obstacles, future research should also explore the possibility that labor's failure to mobilize more effectively in the political arena provided by OSHA hearings represents a strate- gic decision. More specifically, labor may have made a decision to shift its struggle for health and safety laws to the bargaining table given the difficulties of mobilizing the external allies and indigenous resources needed to gain the advantage in the policymaking arena. If gains are more easily made through collective bargaining, organized labor may continue to forfeit its right to participate in public hearings. While perhaps a strategic decision for the organized, our analysis suggests that unorganized workers would pay a high price, as they cannot count on either OSHA or NIOSH to protect worker health and safety in the absence of union pressure. Regulatory law and the conflicts it has generated in the last three decades provide a fruit- ful terrain for addressing these and other theoretical and empirical concerns. Our paper pushes scholars to more fully theorize the complexity of regulatory politics to take account of legal guarantees, resource mobilization, and the technocratization of the state. We also urge further attention to the interdependence of political conflicts. These efforts are necessary if we are to more fully understand the obstacles and opportunities labor faces in its life and death struggle for more protective health and safety laws. Appendix Mobilization and Countermobilization Dynamics The rulemaking dockets and hearing transcripts identify witnesses and their respective policy positions. Docket numbers (e.g., H-052), exhibit numbers (Ex.) and page numbers from the hearing transcripts (Tr.) reference this source. Given the length of these transcripts, we identify witnesses in most cases by using the index that precedes each day of testimony and</page><page sequence="23">Politics of Social Regulation 613 the introductions made by each panel of witnesses. In five cases (fourteen carcinogens, coke oven emissions, lead, cotton dust and benzene), we examined every page of the transcripts and generated nearly identical figures for the relative share of witnesses mobilized by each party. According to our coding scheme, experts include all medical and technical personnel, economists, and those with Ph.D's. In addition, all OSHA/NIOSH staff and other state officials employed in medical, technical and standards development offices, and all witnesses for capi- tal and labor identified as directors of their safety and health departments are considered experts whether or not their credentials are explicitly reported in the hearing transcripts. We do not include technical experts representing various pollution control firms in our count of witnesses because they usually appear simply to "sell their wares" and are otherwise neutral on key policy issues. These witnesses seldom constitute more than 2 percent of the witnesses who appear at public hearings. Policy Outcomes In general, we code the outcome in each case based on a comparison of the key provi- sions of the proposed standard, the final standard, and the standard recommended by labor. We focus primarily on the specified permissible exposure limits. A final standard is coded a victory for capital when the final PEL is less protective than the PEL originally proposed and less protective than the PEL recommended by labor; or the final PEL is the least protective of several alternatives considered and less protective than the PEL recommended by labor. A final standard is coded a victory for labor if the final PEL is more protective than the proposed PEL and supported by labor; or the final PEL is the most protective of several alternatives con- sidered and supported by labor; or the final PEL is identical to the proposed PEL but supported by labor. All other cases are labeled a draw. We follow the same logic in four other cases. The final standard for fourteen carcinogens is labeled a victory for capital because it does not include the use permit system originally proposed and advocated by labor. The generic cancer policy is coded a victory for capital because the ETS provision was dropped from this standard. The final air contaminants standard is coded a "draw" because the final PELs were more pro- tective for some hazards while less protective for others. The outcome in the 1990 asbestos case is coded a victory for capital because the final standard exempted non-asbestiform miner- als and entire sectors of the industry from the asbestos standard adopted earlier.
