Like no other technology, it seemed to embody the dominant Zeitgeist. The contemporary social forces that propelled it, and the promises these forces held for the future—all were translatable to the form and performance of rail technology. As locus of its symbolic power, the locomotive—or "iron horse" as it was popularly called—became a synecdoche not only for the railroad but for a range of diverse and at times conflicting notions of American modernity. The "iron horse" had symbolic import already with its name. Here was a new, unyielding steed far stronger than its natural counterpart—a creature built by man bettering nature. While "horse" could be seen to signal a continuity with tradition—recognizing an earlier role of the animal in exploring and colonizing the continent—the "iron" qualifier clinched the locomotive's progressiveness, its greater work potential.1 Added to these aspects were purely physical ones: the smoke and steam exhausts; the fire of the furnace; the hissing, chugging, and screeching of the machine. Such attributes of the locomotive made it a potent emblem of American industrialization. One may consider, for example, the ease with which the railroad THE CONCORD SAUNTERER, N.S. Volume 7, 1999</page><page sequence="3">56 The Concord Saunterer could be linked to such received contemporary notions as the Commercial Spirit, the Westward Urge and Manifest Destiny. Railroad construction demanded enor mous investments, engineering skill and manual labor to succeed, while the completed tracks openly displayed the inherent strength of these forces working in conjunction. A powerful Puritan myth of settlement indirectly contributed to the technology's advance. According to this conception, the American continent presented the pilgrims with an appropriately harsh wilderness, a nature severely testing their strength of faith and will. Any "progress" involving the subordination of nature—by machine or otherwise—ought consequently to be hailed as a progress of faith. Yet the Puritan myth—and the development it served—was soon tem pered by opposing sentiments. Roderick Nash has argued that successive influ ences of primitivism, a gradually more secularized and affluent society, and the rise of a national consciousness all made for a radical re-evaluation of American nature in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.2 No longer bound to battle with their natural surroundings for survival, Americans instead gained the freedom to aestheticize their environment. What was left of wilderness thus went full turn from liability to asset in the minds of some (but by no means all) citizens. Modem scholarship has also focused on forces of dissent against the dominant settler myth, and specifically explored the ambiguity among American artists as to its worth. As Leo Marx has shown,3 it was soon locked in a progressive dialectic, where contradictory versions competed for legitimacy.4 The dominant view continued to stress conquest as progress: "the belief," in Marx's words, "that history is a record of the steady, cumulative, continuous, and (for its most ardent exponents) predestined expansion of knowledge of (and power over) nature."5 By the same token, however, "a . . . minority blended its own critical, dissident, or 'romantic' response to the onset of industrial capitalism with the opposed repre sentation of the trans-Atlantic migration as a redemptive retreat from the corrupt Old World" (Pilot, xii).6 With the large-scale introduction of the railroad in the American land scape of the nineteenth century, tensions between contrary conceptions mounted. As Marx argues, "the society prefigured by the myth of the Garden would celebrate a passive accommodation to nature's law. There, survival would depend upon organic production or growth. But the machine foretold an economy de signed by human intelligence, and it implied an active, indeed proud, assertion of humanity's dominion over nature" (Pilot, 118). That this development—among a range of sweeping effects—should also cause an acute crisis of representation among American artists is hardly surprising.7 How was one to portray the new Machine, the new landscape? And how, underlying this, should one understand the rapid changes everywhere evident? In the following, I will trace a broad challenge of technology in Thoreau's</page><page sequence="4">Henrik Gustafsson 57 writings by focusing on "Resistance to Civil Government" (1849), the 1850s journal, and—in particular—Walden (1854).8 I will repeatedly discuss the rail road in its various aspects, as it frequently proves to catalyze Thoreau's protean trials with what he saw as an encroaching mechanization. In an earlier essay, I have claimed that Thoreau early on displayed an idealistic disdain for the railroad's materialism and intrusiveness. This was soon complicated, however, by his prag matic indulgence in its efficiency, and thereafter by a selective admiration of its more "natural" characteristics and effects.9 Presently I will argue that Thoreau's remaining external critique of technology gradually develops into an internal, or aesthetic, crisis of perception and writing—and especially so in Walden. Evident here are his pains to distance himself from a concept of textual machinery.10 Thus "Sounds," in a forceful undertow to its overt theme of a "natural" language, poses the vexing question of how, ultimately, to differentiate language from technology?11 TRANSCENDENTALISM &amp; THE "NEW AMERICA" Before looking into his texts, one might fruitfully inquire into the back ground of Thoreau's intellectual milieu. Could any clear-cut Transcendentalist attitude toward technology have influenced him early on? Was Emerson, for example, representative when opining in 1843 that "Machinery &amp; Transcenden talism agree well"?12 Catherine L. Albanese has argued that "the Transcendental ists were somewhat ambivalent about the substance of what they perceived [i.e., societal change]. They marveled at the wonders which technology could produce, yet they feared being overpowered by the logic of the machine.... They credited the commercial ingenuity of their fellow New Englanders" but worried that, "as Emerson once put it, things were 'in the saddle' and rode mankind" (Motion, 148). These sentiments were interlaced with a fundamental "enthusiasm for the 'new ness' in whatever field," Albanese maintains, and one was thus wont to prefer "the dynamic over the placid, the moving over the stationary" (Motion, 149; cf. 133).13 Ultimately, she concludes, this optimistic Transcendentalist stance was rooted in a "theological dictum which identified God with motion" and a moral that thus "equated action (outer or inner) with the good" (Motion, 149). A sweeping Transcendentalist enthusiasm over the "new America as reflected by industrialization, however, must be seen as tentative at best. While Albanese quotes some early, positive Emersonian assessments of the railroad (Motion, 136-37), the later Emerson—particularly after his second visit to En gland in 1847—became increasingly aware of its negative effects, and especially of its links to a rampant capitalism.14 George Hochfield has reasoned that a mounting disturbance to the Transcendentalists was "a fear of the growing influ ence in American life of the twin forces of capitalism and industrialism. This fear probably had its origin in the old Jeffersonian distrust of urban economic concen tration, but it was also grounded in a new awareness of the internal contradictions</page><page sequence="5">58 The Concord Saunterer of democratic society. The very freedom on which democracy was based had unleashed an acquisitive power capable of endangering freedom itself."15 Seen from this historical perspective, the tangible effects of industrial development ought perhaps to have modified some of the idealistic Transcendentalist hopes expressed initially. But while they undoubtedly tempered some enthusiasm, Emerson, for example, apparently retained the belief that "liberty and machinery [are] not necessarily incompatible" ("Transcendental Railroad," 314). Indeed, he went so far as to insist upon technology's naturalness, as G. Ferris Cronkhite has shown: "Ultimately the railroad was a part of Nature; [Emerson held] that the factory village and the railway 'fall within the great Order not less than the beehive or the spider's geometrical web. Nature adopts them very fast into her vital circles, and the gliding train of cars she loves like her own'" ("Transcenden tal Railroad," 314). Thoreau's uneasiness over technology went deeper than Emerson's, and his varied criticism of it remained largely intact over time. Not taking any cue from his fellow Transcendentalists as to its worth, his stance towards technology evolved heuristically, based mainly on his own observations and critical reading. Reviewing J. A. Etzler' s The Paradise within the Reach of all Men, without Labor, by Powers of Nature and Machinery (2d ed., London, 1842) for The Democratic Review in 1843, for example, he was already convinced of the dubious moral effects of a large-scale introduction of technology. The individual was utterly lost in Etzler's communal vision, Thoreau felt, and what remained of him would degenerate into conformity and materialism should the German's scheme be realized.16 ENTER THE MACHINE: "RESISTANCE TO CIVIL GOVERNMENT' With the publication of "Resistance to Civil Government" in the May 1849 Aesthetic Papers, Thoreau presented a rhetorical device building on his earlier stance toward Etzler. Thoreau strengthens his polemic by metaphorically transforming technology into an oppressive force, commencing by calling govern ment a "complicated machinery" that people have foolishly come to demand {Reform, 63-64). 17 Positing "the vitality and force of a single living man" against conformity, he yet concludes that "the mass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies," wryly adding that "wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well" (Reform, 63; 66). To the nonconformist, however, the exercises of government are bound to be felt as impingements. Addressing the question of revolt, Thoreau next contrasts the nation of 1775 to his contemporary one. He comically downplays the older revolution as an eccentric reaction to taxes on foreign goods, whereas the issue in the present—slavery—is seriously felt. His verdict is introduced by a consideration of history: "all machines have their friction; and possibly this [1775</page><page sequence="6">Henrik Gustafsson 59 government] does enough good to counterbalance the evil. The past is then contrasted to the present, in an effective chiasmus: "[b]ut when the friction comes to have its machine, and oppression and robbery are organized, I say, let us not have such a machine any longer" (Reform, 67). A few pages on Thoreau s metaphor is fully developed: If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear smooth,—certainly the machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself, then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter friction to stop the machine. (Reform, 73-74) The range of technical terms here serves to illustrate the moral gap between a virtuous citizen and an oppressive government. The Machine-State derives much of its blunt and vulgar character from the fact that Thoreau chooses, again and again, to pit an individual conscience against it. Thus, while acknowledging another critic's lead in seeing the essay as tripartite—with the State presented in its actual form, later in ideal guise, and the two stages as separated by Thoreau's night-in-jail peripety—one does not necessarily need to extract biblical or Dantean allusions to make sense of the narrative.18 For what occurs in the jail is the individual's symbolic victory over the Machine-State: "I could not but smile to see how industriously [my italics] they locked the door on my meditations, which followed them out again without let or hinderance, and they were really all that was dangerous. As they could not reach me, they had resolved to punish my body. ... Thus the State never intentionally confronts a man's sense, intellectual or moral, but only his body, his senses. It is not armed with superior wit or honesty, but with superior physical strength" (Reform, 80). Victory thus comes as an epiphany, as a moment of sudden insight into the crucial weakness of the State: it never amounts to more than the sum of its parts. And the parts found useful in its subjects are merely their bodies. While the jailers plod with their allotted task (note Thoreau's pun on "industriously"), the prisoner finds that his soul cannot be constrained. His thoughts are free, whereas the Machine-State merely fosters conformity; an urge to "'be a secondary at control,/ Or useful serving-man and instrument/ To any sovereign state'" (Reform, 66).19 These circumstances, which earlier exasperated him, now become a double source of hope. Since the State requires menial service only, the higher mental faculty of man lies latent, waiting to be stirred. Following a common awaken ing to reason and conscience, the State will inevitably lose its oppressive grip. Its populace will aspire to lesser dependence, realizing their potential for individuality.</page><page sequence="7">60 The Concord Saunterer And so the State, by implication, no longer strikes Thoreau as a necessar ily machine-like power: "[I]n proportion as I regard this as not wholly a brute force, but partly a human force, and consider that I have relations to those millions as to so many millions of men, and not of mere brute or inanimate things, I see that appeal is possible, first and instantaneously, from them to the Maker of them, and, secondly, from them to themselves" (Reform, 85). Spanning "Resistance to Civil Government" as a whole, Thoreau's ma chine metaphor is singularly apt to the work's polemical thrust. It is forcefully employed as a key image in an essay wholly concerning human relations. A first section presents the State as a gargantuan, slumberous cyborg—a clear target for rebellious rhetoric. Then, following the incarcerated narrator's moment of insight, the State gradually loses its towering stature, crumbling under the foreseen moral enlightenment of its subjects. Rhetorically, one could say that Thoreau constructs an effective trope only to dismantle it. The machine, as a metaphor of man and synecdoche of the State, is thus effectively portrayed as a transient phenomenon. WALDEN &amp; THE JOURNALS: TOWARD NOVEL PERCEPTION &amp; A "NEW MYTHOLOGY" Thoreau s Journal entries on the railroad during the years spanning the creation of Walden are largely in accord with the moral critique presented in his earlier writings, and also show his mounting concern with the technology's effects on consciousness and landscape. An interesting entry penned May 8, 1852, illustrates: Sundown to Cliffs, (no moon) I am most impressed by the rapidity of the changes within a week. Saw a load of rock maples on a car from the country. Their buds have not yet started—while ours are leaved out— They must have been brought from the northern part of Vermont where is winter still A tree with all its roots which has not felt the influence of spring—is a most startling evidence of winter—of the magic worked by the rail-road—20 What is recorded here is at once a dislocation of space (Vermont maples gliding intact through the Concord landscape) and distortion of time (the same maples, numb and budless from cold, presently meeting the spring warmth of Massachu setts). The rhythm of nature thus yields to the new rhythm of the railroad, working its "magic"—whether black or white—on the senses of the spectator. Barbara Novak has commented on the spread of railroads as instigating a mental transformation of American society: "Railway culture was possibly the first modern culture to fulfill the ancient desire to compress space and purchase time. Indeed, time itself—as vast engines slid along the ever-converging rails,</page><page sequence="8">Hennk Gustafsson 61 wooden sleepers clicking off space as if on a horizontal clock—became a techno logical dimension."21 Following the development of the railroad, accurate clocks indeed came into great demand. Where earlier the light of day often sufficed for guidance, hours and minutes became increasingly important to meet the logistics of the railroad and its concomitant industry. The clock's function was also decisive, as Leo Marx has shown, in linking the nineteenth-century "industrial apparatus with consciousness. The laboring man [became] a machine in the sense that his life [became] more closely geared to an impersonal and seemingly autonomous system" (Machine, 248). Looking ahead to the "Sounds" chapter of Walden, the reader will note that Thoreau there oscillates between different conceptions of time and space. In meditative passages he is wont to cite the sun, as when sitting "in my sunny doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery," while contending that "[m]y days were not days of the week, bearing the stamp of any heathen deity, nor were they minced into hours and fretted by the ticking of a clock."22 When the railroad makes its presence felt, however, he turns abruptly to the new: "for the last half-hour I have heard the rattle of railroad cars," he declares, and later finds that the locomotive's cloud-banner "conceals the sun for a minute" (W, 114; 116). Implicitly addressing this shift in perspective, the writer comments: "The startings and arrivals of the cars are now the epochs in the village day. They go and come with such regularity and precision, and their whistle can be heard so far, that the farmers set their clocks by them, and thus one well conducted institution regulates a whole country. Have not men improved somewhat in punctuality since the railroad was invented? Do they not talk and think faster in the depot than they did in the stage-office?" (W, 117-18). While a portion of irony may be sensed in this summation, Thoreau was not immune to the new. His depiction of evening encounters with whippoorwills in the same chapter is illus trative for its blending of time indicators:23 "Regularly at half past seven, in one part of the summer, after the evening train had gone by, the whippoorwills chanted their vespers for half an hour, sitting on a stump by my door, or upon the ridge pole of the house. They would begin to sing almost with as much precision as a clock, within five minutes of a particular time, referred to the setting of the sun, every evening" (W, 123-24). The perception of space is another factor liable to change with the introduction of the railroad. We see it with the rock maple passage above, but also in "Sounds," where Thoreau's narrator feels "refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me, and I smell the stores . . . reminding me of foreign parts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world" (W, 119). The train pulling its foreign cargo past the writer transforms his immediate environment into a microcosm of the larger world. It helps him assert, as he has earlier in Walden, that "Olympus is but the outside of the earth every where" ( W, 85).</page><page sequence="9">62 The Concord Saunterer Latterly, steam and the fine arts have scraped acquaintance, the real and the ideal have smoked pipes together. The iron horse and Pegasus have trotted side by side in double harness. . . . What will be the result of this conjunction Heaven knows. We believe it marks the commencement of a new era in human progress. —D. H. Strother, Harper's New Monthly Magazine 19 (1859) The Journal s moral critique of the railroad during Walden's conception remained acerbic, even to the extent that some of its most vehement comments were later excluded or toned down in passages otherwise incorporated into "Sounds" and "The Ponds." But there is also, at one point, an intriguing censoring of what seems to be a conciliatory thought experiment. We see it in Thoreau's first portrayal of the iron horse from December 2, 1846. Here the depiction as a whole resembles that of "Sounds" very closely, only not being as concise in its refrains: "If all were as it seems, and men made the elements their servants for noble ends. ... If the elements did not have to lament their time wasted in accompany ing men on their errands. ... If this enterprise were as noble as it seems."24 Thus Thoreau launches an anaphoral complaint to strengthen his polemic against the enterprise. But there is a surprise in store immediately after the passage proper: "No doubt there is to follow a moral advantage proportionate to this physical one," Thoreau writes (Journal 2, 359). Is this statement to be linked to the following discussion of astronomy? Or was Thoreau prepared, for a precarious moment, to reconsider his disdain of the railroad? Thoreau's iron horse appears again in the journal of June 17, 1853. The writing here is a prototype for the locomotive depiction in "The Ponds," portray ing a "devilish Iron Horse, whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the town, [that] has muddied the Boiling Spring with his foot, and . . . browsed off all the woods on Walden shore" (W, 192). What sets the earlier version apart from the Walden text is its greater aggressiveness: its engine "defiles" the spring while the locomotive of "The Ponds" "muddies" it; the journal engine is "insidiously introduced" while the one in Walden is merely "introduced." Subsequently de leted depictions also include sentences where the iron horse "robs the country babies of milk," and where it "carries [men] to [its] infernal home" with the demeanor of a "man-harrier."25 The problem for Thoreau in mythologizing the locomotive thus strikes as one of placement: where, he must ask himself, do I wish to take its metamorpho sis? And how, further, to align it? The 1853 journal passage leads the reader to interpret the locomotive as purely hellish—as a mare of Diomedes bringing doom on its environment. But it is also, in both the journal and "The Ponds," a Trojan horse of wood—an inanimate instrument of war. Further, if we consider the iron horse of the "Sounds" chapter, our confusion will probably grow. For here yet</page><page sequence="10">Henrik Gustafsson 63 another two alternatives are given: "what kind of winged horse or fiery dragon they will put into the new Mythology I don't know," Thoreau writes (W, 116). Robert D. Richardson has commented on the writer's frequent attempts at mythologizing, seeing it as a variable process whereby Thoreau tries "to turn his own facts into fable."26 "Least effective," Richardson argues, are "his modern 'myths' in the antique manner. One example of this is the extended 'fable' which tries to impose the image of the iron horse on a locomotive in a literal way This is mock-myth, enjoyable for its bravura, interesting as it shows the persistent Thoreauvian effort to literally animate the inanimate, but not intended seriously" (Myth, 129). In assessing Thoreau's locomotive image, one might begin by noting its relation to the machine metaphor of "Resistance to Civil Government." There Thoreau's rhetorical strategy involved rendering the American government as an inanimate Machine-State. Here the transformation works the other way, yet arguably to similar effect. Mythologizing works as an enabling resource, allowing Thoreau to present a familiar phenomenon in a new context. This forces his reader—temporarily at least—to suspend preconceived notions and consider things afresh. Richardson s insistence on Thoreau s playfulness with the locomotive is surely correct, but it is a play with serious undertones. The "new Mythology" Thoreau mentions in "Sounds" as the machine's figurative destination can be interpreted philosophically, practically and aesthetically. A modern reader will presumably embrace the former dimension first, recognizing the "winged horse" as an icon of progressiveness, which trait in turn is deified, accepted into the pantheon of the Commercial Age. Thoreau also mentions a "fiery dragon," yet we can still see this beast as a possible alternative to Pegasus, emblematic of strength and assertiveness. One of them will characterize the locomotive and its activity. This, of course, follows the premise that the "they" of the passage (the emergent entrepreneurs) are promoting their own mythology—with the writer merely re cording the fact. Another reading would see "the new Mythology as an allusion to the contemporary practice of painting mythological beasts on the flanks of locomo tive tenders.27 While hardly changing the drift of the reader's interpretation, this helps reinforce the imperative to get behind Thoreau's words, alert for layered significance. A third reading, however, only hesitantly arrives at the "beauty Thoreau s writing would claim. Beauty, Thoreau has stated, should ideally be a culminating aspect of writing upon third perusal, a condition embracing both "plain common sense" and "severe truth."281 have so far considered Thoreau's mythmaking as a showcase of his power to unite and forge a multilayered meaning. But mytholo gizing can also point to a latent anxiety. Sherman Paul has argued keenly to this effect in identifying Thoreau as "troubled by the transcendentalist's usual diffi</page><page sequence="11">64 The Concord Saunterer culty—consecutiveness."29 Paul sees Thoreau as a writer of considerable percep tion, but with a problem in creating "fables as well as symbols" (Shores, 189). Indeed, while the vividness of Thoreau's "Sounds" locomotive is undeniable, it is also a scattered image—hovering between the benign and malignant, the animate and inanimate. It becomes more of a multitudinous, troubling illustration than a unified, coherent symbol. Ultimately, of course, the locomotive image will depend on the writer's attitudes toward his object. What could the engine and its variable shape in "the new Mythology" signify to him? The Journal presents us with an interesting clue. In the September 20, 1851, entry, Thoreau writes of a return from surveying: A fatal coarseness is the result of mixing in the trivial affairs of men. Though I have been associating even with the select men of this and the surrounding towns, I feel inexpressibly begnmmed, my pegasus has lost his wings, he has turned a reptile and gone on his belly. Such things are compatible only with a cheap and superficial life The poet must keep himself unstained and aloof. Let him peram bulate the bounds of Imagination's provinces the realms of faery, and not the insignificant boundaries of towns.30 This meditation on the poet's lot is a recurrent theme with Thoreau. He frequently portrays himself as Apollo tending the flocks of Admetus, doing base practical chores rather than writing. A metaphorical aspect of the passage, however, strikes the reader as novel: the stakes in the "pegasus" and "reptile" pairing are here directly personal. Pegasus, in this context, is most profitably understood as a favorite of the Muses, as a sprightly token of inspiration.31 The reptile, by contrast, would be the diametrical opposite: dull, plodding, and coarse—connoting a wing clipped inspiration or inability to write. To read with the journal's Pegasus/reptile passage in mind entails under standing the beasts of "the new Mythology" in "Sounds" as having a bearing also on the writer and his task; as tensions of vocation. This prompts us to ask further questions. Does the locomotive "they" are launching inspire (as associated with a "winged horse"), or merely drain sensibilities (being linked to a "reptile on its belly")? Furthermore, would the railroad, read as ambiguous, indicate a deeper frustration of craft in the writer? In reply to the first query, Walden appears to answer that the locomotive does both. In "Sounds" there is some extravagantly inspired writing on the iron horse that brims with polemical gusto, but also a writer defensively opposed to the locomotive's more tangible effects: it threatens the acuity of his senses. Thoreau asserts that he "will not have [his] eyes put out and [his] ears spoiled by its smoke and steam and hissing" (W, 122). The image of the iron horse thus remains unresolved, pointing in various directions. And we are perhaps surprised that Thoreau, of all writers, should fail in integrating "the new Mythology"—even if it</page><page sequence="12">Henrik Gustafsson 65 should turn out to be his foe. After all, one of his most astute critics holds that of the New England Transcendentalist writers, "Henry Thoreau made the most deliberate, extensive, original, and successful use of myth" {Myth, 90). What is more, his own assertions as to the expediency of mythology are unequivocal. In the journal of May 10, 1853, Thoreau writes: "He is the richest who has most use for nature as raw material of tropes and symbols with which to describe his life. . . . [For him] every natural phenomenon [will] be a myth. The man of science, who is not seeking for expression but for a fact to be expressed merely, studies nature as a dead language" (Journal #5, 135). To this one may append an earlier journal statement of November 9,1851 : "Facts should only be as the frame to my pictures — They should be material to the mythology which I am writing" (Journal 4, 170). Importantly, Thoreau's comments are closely linked to nature and the natural. Underlying his concept of myth from the very beginning is the faith that any perceived natural fact will eventually "flower in a truth."32 Mythology fur nishes a language that will forward this process, as yet another journal comment of early February 1851 makes clear: "I do not know where to find in any literature [—] whether ancient or modern—any adequate account of that Nature with which I am acquainted. Mythology comes nearest to it of any."33 Olaf Hansen reasons that Thoreau's consequent myth creation (as a writing process) purports to bring the two realms toward fusion: "Nature and myth [in Thoreau] are reconciled through the work of the [writing] imagination, the basis of this process being the idea that they have the same origin."34 Recognizing this organic relationship, Hansen argues further that "Thoreau would have insisted that every natural fact is a spiritual fact" (Aesthetic Individualism, 133). Indeed, he then had only to be attentive of nature, as Perry Miller once observed: "In the glowing confidence of [Thoreau's natural-fact] aphorisms lurks the assumption that moral law and natural law contain analogies, and ... for this reason the writer may safely record facts without metaphors, since truths are bound to sprout from them."35 But there is a serious problem looming behind the locomotive in "Sounds." To what extent, exactly, is it a natural fact?36 Called an "iron horse," it hovers uneasily between the natural and unnatural, the animate and inanimate. The locomotive's myth, as attempted by Thoreau, does not fully convince, does not succeed in integrating the railroad with the natural. What myth, we might ask, can Thoreau write of anything man-made, given his own premises for such writing? In seeking an answer one must look to Thoreau's theory of language. More precisely, one must probe his view of language beyond structural and rhetorical concerns, to examine his comments on the basic building blocks— words, syllables, letters. In "Walking," developed as a lecture in the 1850s and published posthumously in 1862, Thoreau delineates a writer's quest:</page><page sequence="13">66 The Concord Saunterer Where is the literature which gives expression to Nature? He would be a poet who could impress the winds and streams into his service, to speak for him; who nailed words to their primitive senses, as farmers drive down stakes in the spring, which the frost has heaved; who derived his words as often as he used them— transplanted them to his page with earth adhering to their roots; whose words were so true and fresh and natural that they would appear to expand like the buds at the approach of spring, though they lay half smothered between two musty leaves in a library—aye, to bloom and bear fruit there, after their kind, annually, for the faithful reader, in sympathy with surrounding Nature. (Portable, 616) What is presented here is a quest for "root meanings, as William Bysshe Stein eloquently puts it.37 Language is understood as organic, as answering directly to nature. Where Babel might still tower to skeptics, Thoreau's faith in an attainable meaning of words is adamant, and his motion appropriately downward: he alter nately digs, burrows or shovels for their truth.38 Indeed, one might even gather from the passage that words are natural in themselves, if only traced far enough and understood correctly. Time and again in his writings, Thoreau alludes to a dynamic chain of correspondence, where a revealed natural language secures communication between man and God.39 In Philip F. Gura s lucid analysis, Thoreau s gradually emerging philo logical interest of the 1850s—as fueled by language theorists Richard Trench and Charles Kraitsir—crystallized into a twofold quest: first, "to uncover in nature those truths that to the patient observer blossomed from its every nook and cranny; and, second, to learn enough about the origin and meaning of language and its relation to nature to be able to use it to convey these truths."40 As Gura shows, Thoreau was much inspired by Trench's claims of an analogous potential in language, whereby words would ultimately disclose moral truth. Likewise, Kraitsir's contention of a basic unity of utterance and meaning among languages fueled Thoreau's quest to reveal such truth {Words, 117; 126-29).41 Thoreau's eventual synthesis, Gura continues, held that "words were not merely steps to a higher reality but themselves embodied and reflected the reality," resulting in a focus not on transcendence but rather on "the permanence of the physical world in which he, as well as his language, was rooted" {Words, 134; 137). Ultimately, Gura maintains, Thoreau's philological explorations "reas sured him that his world was not fragmented ... but... unified in a powerful way in the cyclical nature of existence" ( Words, 142). Following this line of reasoning, Gura reads the Deep Cut passage of "Spring" as a triumphant "parable of man's entire existence," and contrasts Thoreau to some of his contemporaries in that for him "ambiguity did not become the dominant mode of artistic expression" {Words, 136; 143). While Gura's analysis has rightly become influential, his findings para doxically compound the difficulties of our present question.42 Everything in</page><page sequence="14">Hennk Gustafsson 67 Thoreau s derived theory of language presupposes natural foundations and or ganic relationships. It offers us no clue as to how he would properly depict the locomotive, or indeed technology in general. While Gura speaks of Thoreau's quest (following Kraitsir) of reflecting sense impressions {Words, 127-28), Thoreau's handling of the railroad in Walden and elsewhere can more justly be characterized as deflection,43 He does not strive for a complete picture, only renders parts or fragments. The Deep Cut passage in "Spring is a case in point. What portion of the railroad does Thoreau there consider? Certainly not the locomotive or the lively traffic, but merely the causeway. What is more, the latter is consistently natural ized as a mudbank, until virtually all traces of the machine technology it supports (and is supported by) are erased. As a parable of contemporary existence—and given the prominence of the train and its effects elsewhere in Walden—the Deep Cut is hardly encompassing. It proves more of a deflection by selective focus. A similarly evasive tactic is evident in two shorter Walden poems, "Men say they know many things" in "Economy," and "What's the railroad to me?" in "Sounds." They may well be quoted in parallel: Men say they know many things; But lo! they have taken wings,— The arts and sciences, What's the railroad to me? I never go to see Where it ends. And a thousand appliances; The wind that blows Is all that any body knows. It fills a few hollows, And makes banks for the swallows, It sets the sand a-blowing, (W, 42) And the blackberries a-growing. (W, 122) In each poem the narrator introduces himself by ironically marking his distance from the subject at hand. The various human phenomena cited are seen as barely tangential to the poet's experience. They are, he would have us believe, inconse quential in the face of larger truth—which of course resides in nature. While the arts and sciences presume to "have taken wings," the wind's free motion remains "all that any body knows." "What's the railroad to me?," Thoreau inquires next. His answer is again a trickster's deflection. He documents only the "natural" effects of the technology's advance (which he sees as benign), remaining defiantly silent about other aspects. "What's [it] to me" signals the deflective strategy, reinforced by the writer's deliberate choice "never [to go] see/ Where it ends." In other words, Thoreau will not (at least in his official account) walk to the urban depots at the end of the tracks, nor will he consider the railroad causeway as part of a larger infrastructural complex. The turn toward nature and the natural is a central movement in Walden, and in this vein the railroad's culmination as a naturalized fact in "Spring" is a</page><page sequence="15">68 The Concord Saunterer reading Thoreau was doubtless keen to establish. 4 His skill in generating visible form from etymological and philological impetus (and vice versa) is impressive; his imagination in drawing shapes—bird's feet, leopard's paws, lungs, bowels and excrement—from the shifting sands equally so. Gordon V. Boudreau has gone so far as to consider Thoreau's errand at the Deep Cut a prophetic one, concerning "a passage for Nature's deliverance that involved Thoreau as midwife in the process of converting to language what Nature of herself could only struggle to articu late."45 Yet while Boudreau sees Thoreau as successful—as see[ing], almost clean through, to a side of Nature's sentence that the sand foliage in the Deep Cut riddled" (Roots, 11)—another reading of Walden, and especially of "Sounds," would propose a countercurrent worthy of attention. Thus, while readily acknowl edging that an overt level in "Spring" alludes to Thoreau's Deity—specifically where the Deep Cut is portrayed as a "laboratory of the Artist" ( Walden, 306), one may also fruitfully read "the Artist" secularly as Thoreau the writer, as the Thoreau working on "Spring" in his laboratory of words. To my view, there is a significant undertow in Walden that alternately probes and struggles to evade a fundamental problem of writing. This problem becomes all the more acute as the narrator turns to discuss contemporary technol ogy. There seems to be a budding realization that technology and industry are phenomena that pervade more of life and art than one might wish to acknowledge. While the railroad remains the most obvious symbol of the Machine to Thoreau's narrator, everything of human construction might by extension be considered technological. At hand's end, we have not only a locomotive, but perhaps prima rily—in Thoreau's case—a pen.46 And when trailing another construct (an engine, say) Thoreau's pen inevitably calls attention to its own mechanics and "'tracks": to practices of rhetoric and style, to revision and emphasis—even if they be the author's own.47 Lingering among these "mechanics," I will argue, is a suspicion that they may blur and blunt the higher "truth" they are made to serve. Likewise, the concepts of a natural language and correspondence that Thoreau nurtured are implicitly called into question.48 As I will attempt to show, the overt crisis of technology in Walden ultimately reflects itself as a crisis of craft.49 Nature, to Thoreau, was ... so essential to our inner life that an artificial separation (such as civilized technology often causes) brings about a mental, spiritual, and physical weakening. —Marilynne K. Roach, Down to Earth at Walden (1980) Walden, in the words of Joseph J. Moldenhauer, is "a severely dialectical work."50 We see this, to my mind, already with regard to some of its chapter</page><page sequence="16">Henrik Gustafsson 69 headings. "Economy" may be read as "Common Economy,' and "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For" as Thoreau's transcendental contrast: "True Economy." But then he has also qualified his first chapter by closing with a quote from Thomas Carew's "Coelum Brittanicumwhich ironically undercuts much of the preceding diatribe (W, 80). Many chapter titles reveal a cross-reference at once: "Visitors" follows "Solitude"; "The Bean-Field" precedes "The Village"; "Brute Neighbors" suc ceeds "Higher Laws." Thus, following "Reading," we might expect "Writing" rather than "Sounds."51 The chapter in question does discuss sounds, as its title promises, but—as we shall see—this is done only partially according to its own premises. This inconsistency in turn generates a subdued and often anxious commentary on the foibles of writing. Coupled with the open critiques of machine technology in Walden, it presents a writer's plight interesting for its contrasting energies. WRITING "WALLED-IN How does Walaen's critique ot technology launch itself? In "Economy" Thoreau employs a rhetorical device familiar from "Resistance to Civil Govern ment." To objectify the "factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors" that underlie contemporary America, the writer asserts that "the laboring man . . . has no time to be any thing but a machine," later also calling the farming sector an "agricultural machine" (W, 6; 33). He further exemplifies a mechanical state by characterizing the new factory system as profit driven and as tending toward a lamentable division of labor (cf. W, 26-27; 46; 50). Beyond this, Thoreau also contrasts industrious ... neighbors devoted to profit with an "internal industry and expansion" of his own ken ( W, 19; 24). His deeper concern involves a perceived immersion in technology: "But lo! men have become the tools of their tools" (W, 37; cf. 56). Man's inventions are bound to disturb his true development; they "are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at; as railroads lead to Boston or New York" ( W, 52).52 The railroad in "Economy" repeatedly becomes the subject of lengthier critiques, launched to complement the aphorisms surrounding it. What generally separates these renderings from earlier ones is their humorous bent, as Thoreau uses exaggerations and puns as critical weaponry: "I think that in the railroad car we are inclined to spend more on luxury than on safety and convenience. ... I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself, than be crowded on a velvet cushion. I would rather ride . . . with a free circulation, than [travel in] an excursion train and breathe a malaria ' (W, 37). Perhaps echoing his earlier surprise at reading of mahogany panels "even [in] luggage vans" on the London &amp;</page><page sequence="17">70 The Concord Saunterer North-Western (Journal 3, 13), his comments on car luxury here approach both the satirical and absurd. J. Golden Taylor has noted how Thoreau "makes his most serious assessments of man and the institutions of his society . .. humorous," and surely this is the mode of critique here employed.53 Following the episode on railroad luxury, Thoreau cites a conversation on travel. His speaking partner advocates train transport as swift and convenient, and recommends that Thoreau "take the cars to Fitchburg [to] see the country" (W, 53). The writer answers with an elaborate argument that train travel is overly inefficient and expensive. How so? While Thoreau is walking to Fitchburg and enjoying the scenery, his erstwhile companion will be working to earn his fare— arriving in town by nightfall at best. Thus Thoreau will perpetually keep ahead of his fellow man, "and as for seeing the country and getting experience of that kind," he declares, "I should have to cut your acquaintance altogether" (VV, 53). Thoreau's wit here borrows from the classic fable of the hare and tortoise. An elaborate group of preconditions must be fulfilled for the chain to hold, especially in the long run. For the day trip to Fitchburg, however, the humorous logic survives— and Thoreau is quick to extract a contention: "Such is the universal law, which no man can ever outwit, and with regard to the railroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long. To make a railroad round the world available to all mankind is equivalent to grading the whole surface of the planet. Men have an indistinct notion that if they keep up this activity of joint stocks and spades long enough all will at length ride somewhere, in next to no time, and for nothing" (W, 53). The larger question burdening Thoreau's railroad in "Economy"—be hind its humor and satirical zest—is the purport of its expansion. Its "grading" capacity is found to be not only geographical, but also mental. It affects conscious ness: man's senses and their moral core. Man, caught off guard, is himself "graded" into specialization. He is lured to the logic of the machine—to "save" time, increase speed, increase profits. The railroad, as an "unreflected" tool, is thus exposed by Thoreau. Indeed, the whole chapter can be read as a questioning of the "tools" with which we would enrich our lives: from our overly elaborate food, clothing, and houses to our institutions, machines, and profit-centered economic system. Countless critical readings confirm this. Yet 1 would suggest that there is a significant undercurrent to Thoreau's boisterous critique that approaches self-recognition. Thoreau delineates a hope of total understanding between his persona and audience early in "Economy": "Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other's eyes for an instant? . . . History, Poetry, Mythology!—I know of no reading of another's experience so startling and informing as this would be" ( W, 10). But this hope is not to be realized, as the author himself soon confesses: "You will pardon some obscurities, for there are more secrets in my trade than in most men's, and yet not voluntarily kept, but inseparable from its very nature" (W, 17).54 There are thus aspects of Thoreau's craft that will ineluctably come between him and his reader, marring communication.</page><page sequence="18">Henrik Gustafsson 71 What aspects may these be? If we remain with "Economy,' we remain with Thoreau's critique of institutions. The life of a civilized people is an institu tion, Thoreau asserts, "in which the life of the individual is to a great extent absorbed, in order to preserve and perfect that of the race. But I wish to show at what a sacrifice this advantage is at present obtained, and to suggest that we may possibly so live as to secure all the advantage without suffering any disadvantage" (W, 31-32). Thoreau here concedes that his project will necessarily launch from within what is established, from within his culture. His tone is not fully confident, and he qualifies his success as possible rather than certain. He next centers on a crux of aesthetics: "The best works of art are the expression of man's struggle to free himself from this [institutional] condition, but the effect of our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher state to be forgotten" (W, 37). Thoreau's chosen task thus admits to monumental difficulty. He must, again, from within strive to transform his culture and its inhabitants. As a writer, his most pressing problem becomes one of language: How shall he at once free himself from its traditional bounds and make himself understood?55 How, in other words, can he quest to transform the institutions of writing and reading while simultaneously using the very mechanics that have always propped them up? This remains a latent question throughout Walden, whose narrator tends to alternate between confident boasting and self-conscious deflection. In "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For, Thoreau seems eager to boost his morale in contrasting his own life and writing with those of others: "I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost" (W, 84). In emulating the clarion bird, Thoreau must become an early riser, a reformer of self, knowing "of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor" (W, 90). Consciousness—to be sentient—is a primary goal: "Little is to be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we are not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some servitor, are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and aspirations from within, accompanied by the undulations of celestial music, instead of factory bells" (W, 89). Sleep is thus not merely a physical state (from which factory bells indeed may wake us), but a spiritual predicament: "We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us in our soundest sleep" ( W, 90). This would be the program for the "alert and healthy natures" Thoreau calls for early in "Economy" (W, 8). Mastering it would be prophetic or even divine: "I have never," the writer asserts, "yet met a man who was quite awake. How could I have looked him in the face?" ( W, 90). To further exemplify his spiritual metaphor, Thoreau contrasts a mis guided sympathy for national wants with true individual needs. Railroads, among a score of technological innovations, are presented as superfluous to the matter of</page><page sequence="19">72 The Concord Saunterer reforming and redeeming the self. The narrator continues: Did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad? Each one is a man, an Irish-man, or a Yankee man. The rails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and run over; so that, if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep, a supernumer ary sleeper in the wrong position, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue and cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may sometime get up again. (W, 92 93) Ostensibly, Thoreau explains what the "sleepers" stand for in the passage.56 On a literal level they may be rectangular wooden logs, but symbolically, we are told, they represent the railroad workers molded by their toil.57 This explanation is of course only a prodding of the reader to extrapolate further, because the "sleepers" can be read as displaying moral and religious overtones beyond literal and symbolical levels. For what is the "man sleeping"—sleep depicted as his common state (cf. W, 325)—but the man uninformed of the extraneous nature of technol ogy in general? And what are, ultimately, the sleepers that "may sometime get up again" but a reserve of potentially resurrected men, who may one day rise from their "digging in this dirt" (W, 54)? Mock-prophetic at most, Thoreau manages to charge his pun to an intriguing but finally somewhat confusing effect.58 First called a "supernumerary sleeper," the walker is at the end of the sentence no longer considered "an exception." Further, as Moldenhauer has noted, the phrase "in the wrong position" yields paradox: "instead of walking stupidly and sleepily on the track—preserving a merely physical uprightness—[the railroad worker] should perhaps have wholly abandoned himself to his futile labor and lain down with the ties. ... In terms of the railroad's 'economy' he should have been at the same time a sleeper and not a sleeper" ("Paradox," 104).59 Several statements in the passage can thus be seen to play against each other, by turns strengthening or unsettling significance. There are other examples of ambiguity concerning the railroad in the same chapter. Arguing that we should esteem realities only, and discard "shams and delusions," Thoreau writes: "The universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us. ... Let us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquito's wing that falls on the rails" (W. 95; 97). What is curious about this quote is that it relates railroad tracks to those made by man "on the right track." Thoreau uses a definite article, "the track," in both cases, and here</page><page sequence="20">Henrik Gustafsson 73 also seems to accord walking with other valid possibilities: "fast or slow (my emphases). The railroad is thus at once used as a warning example (it derails easily) and as an inspirational one (it follows its own track).60 The reader must make sense of two distinct interpretive alternatives. Indeed, the passage poses problems similar to those ensuing from the iron horse references in "Sounds," a chapter which shall soon be addressed. WALDEN; or, LIFE IN THE WORDS? In a provocative reading of Walden as parody, an earlier critic has argued that "Thoreau explores the multiple meanings of key signifiers narrowly used by his culture. His various new/old deployments of terms and conventions are simply extensions of something stable and central. Such a re-registration of language revitalizes and greatly enriches the language without fundamentally reconstituting it, that is, without fundamentally contesting and displacing conventions."61 In deed, looking back to "Economy" we notice how Thoreau often appropriates the terminology of what he would otherwise deplore, in order to characterize his own quest: "I have always endeavored to acquire strict business habits," he asserts, adding that Walden Pond would be a good place to implement them (W, 20-21 ). At Walden he also foresees "an internal industry and expansion," and later resorts to paradox in maintaining idleness as "the most attractive and productive industry" (W, 24; 191). Scrutinizing some of the industrial phenomena explicitly criticized in "Economy," we also find that the narrator often defensively blurs his alignment or hushes an initial imperative: "it certainly is better to accept the advantages, though so dearly bought, which the invention and industry of mankind offer," Thoreau concedes apropos his building materials (W, 40).62 Later he calls the division of labor—which he has earlier exemplified as a crucial contrast between thinking for himself and of others thinking for him—a "principle which should never be followed but with circumspection" (W, 50; cf. 46). Further, when prodded by thoughts of the Irish construction workers, Thoreau concedes that their work has been "comparatively good" (W, 54). I would suggest that the latent ambiguity of these various concessions has important bearing on the other work Thoreau did at the pond, which was to write. Invention, industry, and originality are all issues that adhere also to the problems of writing, to language and style, in Thoreau's book. In a valuable study on Thoreau's aesthetics of nature, Peter A. Fntzell has proposed that [Thoreau's style] is dialectic, in the fullest sense. At the very least, it is a style of unresolved tension and ambiguity. At worst (or best), it is a dissonant style, a style that (pursued too seriously) can easily lead to cognitive dissonance—the</page><page sequence="21">74 The Concord Saunterer kind of style utterly appropriate to a writer who would fully explore the competi tive relationships between the individual and his or her environment, the indi vidual and his species, species (including species possessed by language and logic) and their environments.63 Several of these arguments are illuminating also with regard to the present discussion. "Cognitive dissonance" sums up our experience in encountering Thoreau's iron horse and sleepers. Calling Thoreau a writer who explores rather than resolves competitive relationships is also apt, in that it gives due credit to Thoreau's rhetorical achievements while not shunning their limitations. Finally, Fritzell recognizes the central difficulty for Thoreau as a self-professed advocate of Nature, Simplicity, and Originality: human beings are possessed by language and logic. In communication, language is the grid our experience must most often be filtered through, and language has its necessary logic of use. Language is thus at once, and acutely so, both tool and hindrance for a writer of Thoreau's inclination. As Eric J. Sundquist has observed regarding A Week, Thoreau's "essays out of Concord do not quite allow him to escape its civilized encumbrances, but only leave him torn between two worlds—one which he seemingly wants to repudiate, but which trails naggingly behind as soon as he shoves off in search of that other one he can never have."64 This crisis ultimately envelops Thoreau's writing, as he finds that he "cannot quite sneak into Nature without leaving behind the scars of his entrance" (Home, 42; cf. 47). The same dilemma is compounded, Sundquist argues, in that it forces Thoreau's philosophy to "reevaluate the catego ries of Nature and the primitive [as desired ends] with dramatic urgency," thus also creating an aesthetic impasse: Thoreau's Nature becomes "a self-emptying term that works as a constant in his unending attempt to balance the equation of wilderness and civilization" (Home, 42; 49).65 At the other end of the scale, the polar term "civilization" will of course amass rather than "self-empty." To Thoreau, its weightiest and most alarming addition would be language itself. A full concession of the (^«-naturalness of language would by inference render him silent. His tentative solution in A Week is to portray writing as transforming rather than conquering. Like a plow, the ideal sentence there makes '"a furrow deep and straight to the end'"—and it thus, with Sundquist's term, becomes an instrument of "cultivationof "inflictions] on a pristine landscape that at once violate its soil and instigate production" {Home, 47).66 In turn, Walden?s production is—in a primary sense—also words, and one may easily agree with Sundquist that its vaunted simplicity and economy are unnerving in light of its ornate rhetoric (Home, 43). •'READING" &amp; THE BURDEN OF LANGUAGE</page><page sequence="22">Henrik Gustafsson 75 Thoreau's sensitivity to the latent problem of textual complexity is addressed in "Reading," where his narrator calls for an unprecedented interpretive skill and stamina. The onus of language and meaning is here upon the reader.67 Thoreau's book, it is clearly hinted, will crave careful study. However, the transition toward an interpretive focus is launched already by the closing pages of "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For." There Thoreau affirms the existence of a foundation, of "a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call reality, and say, This is, and no mistake" (W, 98). His quest, appropriately, tells him that "my head is an organ for burrowing, as some creatures use their snout and fore-paws, and with it I would mine and burrow my way through these hills" ( W, 98). Thus the author assumes his share of responsibility for the credibility of his text. His statement of purpose mirrors the later, linguistic archaeology at the Deep Cut in "Spring," and in a broader sense the quest for "root meaning" and origin through out Walden. Earlier in "Economy," Thoreau has fondly quoted Edward Johnson on the first settlers of Concord: "'they burrow themselves in the earth for their first shelter'" (W, 38). So Thoreau also strives to settle and burrow, although his aim, of course, goes beyond mere survival. Commencing "Reading," Thoreau confidently assures us that "in dealing with truth we are immortal, and need fear no change nor accident" (W, 99). The reading of good literature is therefore a noble pursuit, albeit a demanding one: "The heroic books, even if printed in the character of our mother tongue, will always be in a language dead to degenerate times; and we must laboriously seek the meaning of each word and line, conjecturing a larger sense," Thoreau writes ( W, 100). His "larger sense" is of course truth, the apprehension of which is the goal of reading. Bounty will ensue for those who take their interpretive task seriously: "There are probably words addressed to our condition exactly, which, if we could really hear and understand, would be more salutary than the morning or the spring to our lives" (IV. 107). The qualifying "probably" points to the need of a discerning choice of material. Not just any book will suffice. The work at hand might not measure up to valuable standard: "The modern cheap and fertile press," Thoreau asserts, "with all its translations, has done little to bring us nearer to the heroic writers of antiquity" (W, 100). Thoreau's proposed remedy is self-education—even "if you learn only some words of an ancient language" ( W, 100)—and further an officially sanctioned "uncommon school" to provide the ground for such knowledge ( W, 110). A more insidious danger is the prolific spread of "easy reading" (W, 104), a related trap awaiting the prospective reader. With regard to such output Thoreau vents his sarcasm: "There is a work in several volumes in our Circulating Library entitled Little Reading, which I thought referred to a town of that name which 1 had not been to. There are those who, like cormorants and ostriches, can digest all sorts of this, even after the fullest dinner of meats and vegetables, for they suffer</page><page sequence="23">76 The Concord Saunterer nothing to be wasted. If others are the machines to provide this provender, they are the machines to read it" ( W, 104-5). Thoreau here expands his cluster of machine metaphors to drive home the risks of a mechanistiscally (de)generate literature and literary audience. Both writers and readers may become machines; i.e., producers and consumers of standardized goods. Thoreau's mock confusion regarding "Little Reading" serves to distance his own craft and reading from such charges, while he also confesses to a lure of distraction. He evidently left his copy of The Iliad largely unread during his first summer at the pond, while instead finding time to look into "one or two shallow books of travel" (W, 100).68 To impress his focal point, Thoreau summarizes by positioning reading among some of his central images and concepts: "of reading as a noble exercise [most men] know little or nothing; yet this only is reading, in a high sense, not that which lulls us as a luxury and suffers the nobler faculties to sleep the while, but what we have to stand on tiptoe to read and devote our most alert and wakeful hours to" (W, 104). Beyond the practice of writing and reading, Thoreau s chapter reaches a culmination with its discussion of the hierarchy of language: [T]here is a memorable interval between the spoken and the written language, the language heard and the language read. The one is commonly transitory, a sound, a tongue, a dialect merely, almost brutish, and we learn it unconsciously, like the brutes, of our mothers. The other is the experience and maturity of that; if that is our mother tongue, this is our father tongue, a reserved and select expression, too significant to be heard by the ear, which we must be born again in order to speak. (W, 101) Writing should thus be a funnel or distillation of speech (or natural sound), rendered sparse and nugget-like on the page. Great faith is put in its power, as it may express truths that cannot be uttered by any but the redeemed. Consequently, merely speaking a language does not equal being able to (truly) read it; eloquence heard may be found "rhetoric in the study;" and to "hear" will always be lesser than to "understand' ( W, 101-2).69 Here it may well be, as Stanley Cavell has strongly argued, that Thoreau sees himself as destined to write Scripture; to write significantly where every word "must stand for silence and permanence; that is to say, for conviction."70 Such "conviction," it may be inferred, prompts Thoreau to maintain in "Conclu sion" that "[t]he volatile truth of our [written or seriously spoken] words should continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement" (W, 325). Cavell's Thoreau has accepted the call to write seriously, making "the literary ambition of Walden ... to shoulder the commitment in prose" (Senses, 31). Thoreau's calling links him to the biblical prophets, even though the time for vocal prophecy is over. Everything has already been said, laid down, and what</page><page sequence="24">Henrik Gustafsson 77 remains is a task of accounting and warning (Senses, 29-30). A trait Thoreau shares with the prophets is a "mood at once of absolute hope and yet of absolute defeat" (Senses, 9). Walden and Scripture thus become similar in that "the position from which they are written is an absolute knowledge ... that this is not necessary, not from God, but self-imposed" (Senses, 20). To Cavell, the burden of history is what separates Thoreau from the prophets, and so the burden of the New Land: the reality of America as opposed to its idea among its European settlers. Acknowledging Cavell s insights, I would go on to suggest that the crisis of history, of being a latter-day writer in an unfulfilled country, for Thoreau becomes a crisis of language. Language is found contaminated by mechanics, by trade secrets, by ignorance of intent and original meaning. When history fails Thoreau his turn is most often toward nature, toward that which would still indicate God's presence. His problem, in seeing nature as a reminder, repository, and remedy, is that he cannot escape the blunt tool of language if he would prophesy as to nature's worth. He cannot leave his account, wake his neighbors up, without language—yet its aid is bound to be perfunctory and unreliable.71 Thoreau struggles in Walden to make nature the perfect symbol of his quest. Nature would provide purity: pure sound, pure silence, pure experience; further, it would furnish allegories of moratorium, self-cleansing, molting and Higher Laws.72 Nature would also, indeed, equip the writer with tropes, figures, and parables to augment his power of expression.73 Yet language cannot translate experience with anything approaching purity. Like the huckleberries losing their taste going to town, much will inevitably be lost in transmission. Sundquist touches eloquently on this problem in À Week: "'Pure sound' and 'pure figure,' since they are tropes of a fantasized moment, an Eden at the outset of the history of rhetoric, name a condition which is ultimately mystical or totemic in dimension, one which must not, yet can only, be figurative, like the speech of a lost god" {Home, 52). To further this argument, we may say that while Thoreau's God in Walden might not be lost to nature, he will—as Babel reminds us—be lost to our words. He can only be summoned figuratively through the grid of our (necessarily imprecise) latter-day language. Thoreau himself appears to touch on this dilemma briefly in "House-Warming": "It would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all its nerve and degenerate into palaver wholly, our lives pass at such remoteness from its symbols, and its metaphors and tropes are necessarily so far fetched, through slides and dumb-waiters, as it were; in other words, the parlor is so far from the kitchen and workshop. ... As if only the savage dwelt near enough to Nature and Truth to borrow a trope from them" {W, 244-45). Thoreau's kitchen and workshop is of course nature, whereas the "slides and dumb-waiters" aptly characterize the usually careless language that would transmit its boon. In the rare instance where Thoreau finds an alertness to nature in others, this is most often conveyed by idealized images of the infant/ child or Indian (W, 98; 196). Neither, of course, is contaminated by the language</page><page sequence="25">78 The Concord Saunterer Thoreau knows: the one has not yet learnt it, the other has his own that cannot— strictly speaking—be translated. Therefore, as an adult and educated member of his culture, Thoreau finds himself trapped. His experience of nature cannot aptly be communicated. "[N]ot till we are completely lost . . . till we have lost the world" he writes at one point, "do we appreciate the vastness and strangeness of Nature" (W, 171; cf. 216-17; 282). Thus "Thoreau's paradoxical burden," as Sundquist has argued from A Week, ultimately "corresponds to that voiced by Lévi-Strauss in Tristes Tropiques—that since 'man is inseparable from language and language implies society,' the privileged state of Nature is destined to remain but a fantasy, an alluring cul-de-sac" (Home, 53).74 In other words, while Thoreau's felt nature epipanies may be genuine enough, he is bound to find that he cannot reproduce them by way of his craft. "SOUNDS" AND THE LIMITS OF LANGUAGE Thoreau's testing ground for the potential of writing in Walden comes in "Sounds." His introductory paragraph is here a statement of purpose on which the rest of the chapter—and, in many ways, the entire work—pivots: But while we are confined to books, though the most select and classic, and read only particular written languages, which are themselves but dialects and provin cial, we are in danger of forgetting the language which all things and events speak without metaphor, which alone is copious and standard. Much is published, but little printed. The rays which stream through the shutter will be no longer remembered when the shutter is wholly removed. No method or discipline can supersede the necessity of being forever on the alert. What is a course of history, or philosophy, or poetry, no matter how well selected, or the best society, or the most admirable routine of life, compared with the discipline of looking always at what is to be seen? Will you be a reader, a student merely, or a seer? Read your fate, see what is before you, and walk on into futurity. (W, 111) Thoreau begins by making clear that language (as reconstructed experience) necessarily involves confinement. Language is curtailed by its own limitations; its reach is only provincial at a Walden scene which would aspire to be a world in miniature. Language is thus a shutter to the light of reality, ever imposing a gridlock, whether rough or fine.75 And the writer's proposed remedy? A focus on direct experience, on alertness and flexibility.76 Such "discipline" is altogether different from the mere "routine of life" that would work to standardize and so squander experience. The duty of writing must also parallel the call to discipline—a discipline, in this vein, of wariness against writing routinely, standardly, lifelessly. Much text is blandly issued by "machine" writers as provender for mass audiences, while</page><page sequence="26">Hennk Gustafsson 79 little new, vigorous writing is offered to the discerning reader. Writing must aspire to life. What Thoreau strives for in this paragraph is to poise his writing for an ultimate challenge: to capture without metaphor, without clutter, that "which all things and events speak ... which alone is copious and standard."77 That "much is published" in this context also suggests that while much of reality makes itself known, few take the trouble of attempting to grasp it, whether in writing or otherwise.78 Of course Thoreau realizes his writing, in an absolute sense, must fail. To (re)create a world, one must either be a god or an artist of Kouroo, with unlimited time at one's hands.79 What "Sounds" does is rather to enact a fascinating, multi layered dialectic on the possibilities of writing. It does not culminate in a hasty escape, but rather—to paraphrase Tomas Transtrômer—presents the reader with a "cunning and hopeful" retreat in the face of circumstance.80 The second paragraph of 'Sounds," however, gives us anything but a retraction. To Thoreau's most faithful scholar it is "one of the outstanding expres sions of the mystical experience in literature" (Annotated Walden, 108). Indeed, an important declaration inaugurates it: "There were times," the writer says, "when I could not afford to sacrifice the bloom of the present moment to any work, whether of the head or hands" (W, 111). This echoes his exhortation in "Economy," where he tells us that "[m]ost men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them," adding that "[t|he finest qualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the most delicate handling" ( W, 6). As related to his work, these statements inform us that writing, while inevitably residual, must be crafted with all possible care. Bloom is what writing strives to capture, yet seems bound to tarnish. Read in this light, Thoreau's report that "it was morning, and lo, now it is evening, and nothing memorable is accomplished" ( W, 112) at once delineates the temporal structure of the chapter and ironically concedes to its shortcomings—stocked with "soiling" metaphor as it is. Thoreau's next move is to illustrate his attempt at a clean slate in physical terms. This action reifies his earlier rhetorical call for a rock bottom or "point d'appui" to his writing: When my floor was dirty, I rose early, and, setting all my furniture out of doors on the grass, bed and bedstead making but one budget, dashed water on the floor, and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it, and then with a broom scrubbed it clean and white.... It was pleasing to see my whole household effects out on the grass, making a little pile like a gypsy's pack, and my three-legged table, from which I did not remove the books and pen and ink, standing amid the pines and</page><page sequence="27">80 The Concord Saunterer hickories. They seemed glad to get out themselves, and as if unwilling to be brought in. I was sometimes tempted to stretch an awning over them and take my seat there. It was worth the while to see the sun shine on these things, and hear the free wind blow on them; so much more interesting most familiar objects look out of doors than in the house. A bird sits on the next bough, life-everlasting grows under the table, and blackberry vines run round its legs; pine cones, chestnut burs, and strawberry leaves are strewn about. It looked as if this was the way these forms came to be transferred to our furniture, to tables, chairs, and bed steads,— because they once stood in their midst. ( W, 112-13) With sly humor Thoreau stages the drama of his work as a still life. Symbolically clearing his page, he places his writing tools out of doors: to meet with the nature they are constantly struggling to grasp. Once placed there, it is hardly surprising that they are "unwilling" to be brought in. Thoreau enjoys seeing the sun play on their surfaces, and is yet aware that taking a seat with them is a chimerical solution. Bound to civilization as he ineluctably is, the writer would blur the influence of nature; here, his awning blots out the sun in emulation of his extant dwelling (which by its very existence delimits a separation from the outdoors).81 Finally, as if to fully concede his fantasy, Thoreau denies his writing tools any favored link to nature. He does not list them among the various items that seem to have taken their form from having "stood in [nature's] midst."82 Thoreau s following paragraph gives a description of the rich and varied vegetation about his house. At the same time, it gives resonance to his effort of writing in highlighting the vigorousness of nature. The sand cherry, its stems "weighed down with good sized and handsome berries, fell over in wreaths like rays on every side," Thoreau recalls. Further, sumac was "pushing up through the embankment," its leaf buds "suddenly pushing out late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be dead, [and] developed themselves as if by magic into graceful green and tender boughs" (W, 114). In fact, Thoreau maintains, "so heedlessly did they grow and tax their weak joints" that he at times found a bough "broken off by its own weight." The nearby berries in turn often "bent down and broke their tender limbs" ( W, 114). The dry stick which "'had seemed to be dead" lends itself as the writer's pen.83 From Thoreau's vantage, he would feel it invigorated, indeed sprung to life, from nature's influence. But his pen cannot maintain the immense pressure of life—of nature's own modes of expression. The omnipresent bending and break ing in the paragraph signals Thoreau's concession that his art must yield. His work would be a "shutter" to the rays of the sand cherry, which yet is overcome by its own weight. Nature's expression is so rich that it is bound to be fleeting: its fruits bloom only to fall, and its stems—first greened and strengthened by spring— ultimately snap from burdening themselves. Thoreau's remarks here echo his concern in "Economy," where he speaks of the difficulty of man's grasping the</page><page sequence="28">Henrik Gustafsson 81 finer fruits of life, a feat made possible only by "the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly" (W, 6). Another aspect of the paragraph is also significant. Nature is seen as "taxing [its] weak joints" in a process of maturation and expression; its very "weakness" allowing a unique and tender bloom that soon succumbs to its own magnificence.84 When man, by contrast, strives for another kind of bloom—of profit by trade or industry—the iron "joints" he constructs are made to hold indefinitely under tension. Thoreau reminds the reader in "Economy" of the steadily functioning "joints of the agricultural machine," and is also concerned over the incessant "activity of joint stocks and spades" that furthers the railroad (W, 33; 53). But these strong, manmade links are, as Thoreau wishes to assure us, trivial to him. Thus, while they are said to have "nothing important to communi cate" (W, 52), the business of the greening stem and swelling berry is the expression of life itself—of the finest and most delicate florescence. Yet Thoreau's crisis of writing is inevitably amplified by his distinction of "joints" in that it begs the question where his language would reside. What kind of "joint" he can aspire to establish with his pen? Can he still—granted nature's gracing him with a "green stem"— write nature, write life? Or is he bound to a chain of supposedly lifeless, "mechanical" communication with a "dry stick"? His stated instinct, as ever, is to dig for words, to root out their natural meaning. But digging can glide into folly, as Thoreau's narrator also realizes in "Economy": "there was a crazy fellow once in this town who undertook to dig to China, and he got so far that, as he said, he heard the Chinese pots and kettles rattle; but I think that I shall not go out of my way to admire the hole which he made" (W, 58). What links this man to Thoreau is his determination, his single mindedness of task. Yet in a craze of work, any work, its rationale risks being dimmed or lost. The Walden writer watching the locomotive's momentum also understands this, even to the extent that he recognizes the parallel danger to his own vocation: "up come the books, but down goes the wit that writes them" ( W, 116). A crucial aspect of the writer's task thus crystallizes as vigilance. He must not lose himself to his tools; he must be alert lest his language ossify into stock phrases and hackneyed images, empty rhetoric and posturing. He must, in Cavell's sense, keep his commitment to meaning and economy, even in the face of severe difficulty. Both concern and hope imbue a passage in "Sounds" touching on these matters: "If all were as it seems, and men made the elements their servants for noble ends ! If the cloud that hangs over the engine were the perspira tion of heroic deeds, or as beneficent to men as that which floats over the farmer's fields, then the elements and Nature herself would cheerfully accompany men on their errands and be their escort" ( W, 116). Writing, like the ideal engine, should be noble, heroic, beneficent—so, and only so, will nature escort it.</page><page sequence="29">82 The Concord Saunterer TOWARD A THEORY OF RENATURALIZATION "Sounds spends much energy on its writer s encounters with the rail road. Various aspects of the technology are summoned to discussion, often in attempt to define Thoreau's own project as against its traits and effects. Of the iron horse, for example, Thoreau complains that he is "awakened by his tramp and defiant snort at midnight" (W, 117). His symbolic waking bird, however, remains elusive: "I am not sure that I ever heard the sound of cock-crowing from my clearing"; indeed, "its shrill sound never roused me from my slumbers," he declares (W, 127). While the latter phrase may be a hint that the writer needed no awakening, the railroad indeed endangers his alertness by threatening his senses. Hastily making a retreat from its tracks, he exclaims: "I will not have my eyes put out and my ears spoiled by its smoke and steam and hissing" ( W, 122). Another troubling aspect of the railroad is its displacing capacity. Ironi cally, while laying firm tracks it also fosters a dulled sensitivity to place and motion: "in the darkest night dart these saloons without the knowledge of their inhabitants; this moment stopping at some brilliant station-house in town or city, where a social crowd is gathered, the next in the Dismal Swamp, scaring the owl and fox" ( W, 117). Parabolically understood, this passage underscores the danger of mechanical writing. Such writing insulates itself from nature, from place and natural motion, keeping to an artificial rut of its own making. Thoreau's writer would strive to preserve integrity and cultivate expression by shying from trodden paths.85 Solitude and independence are vital concerns that follow him during the development of Walden, as ajournai entry of August 31, 1850, makes clear: "My friends wonder that I love to walk alone in solitary fields &amp; woods by night. Sometimes in my loneliest &amp; wildest midnight walk I hear the sound of the whistle &amp; the rattle of the cars, where perchance some of those very friends are being whirled by night over as they think a well known safe &amp; public road I see that men do not make or choose their own paths whether they are railroads or trackless through the wilds" (Journal 3, 110).86 "Sounds" warns its readers against the railroad, urging them "sincerely by any power to get off its track" ( W, 118). Indeed, the railroad may harm the basic qualities of life: "We live the steadier for it. We are all educated thus to be sons of Tell. The air is full of invisible bolts. Every path but your own is the path of fate. Keep on your own track, then" (W, 118). Thoreau's critique is signaled by his ambiguous "sons of Tell." Are we to be archers of Tell's precision, trusting our weapons, or are we to be sons of Tell, continually exposed to the risk of impreci sion in the goals of our fathers, and to the instruments—industry—they have fostered? The bolts in the air may not simply be there to steady our lives, but to threaten them as well. Bolts forge our constructions, to be sure, but they also denote the end-piece of our weapons, like that of Tell's. They are easily turned</page><page sequence="30">Hennk Gustafsson 83 against us. The remedy is a step aside: away from mechanics, away from the common legacy of misdirected industry, and away from a naive trust in tools. To keep one's own track, in this regard, becomes a matter of fate or freedom, life or death. Sounds next turns to an encounter with a freight train, whose exotic cargo entices the writer. Catching sight of bales of worn cloth he exclaims: "This car-load of torn sails is more legible and interesting now than if they should be wrought into paper and printed books. Who can write so graphically the history of the storms they have weathered as these rents have done? They are proof-sheets which need no correction" (W, 119). So Thoreau stresses the superiority of direct experience. The sails themselves would give a more accurate log of their wear and tear than writing as such ever could. Toying nevertheless with the idea of flawless transmission, Thoreau muses that the cloth gathered will serve truth in its proper guise; that on it "will be written tales of real life, high and low, and founded on fact!" (W, 120; my emphasis). Yet Thoreau s next digression immediately puts such hope in doubt. Passed by cars loaded with salt fish "thoroughly cured for this world" (note the self-reflexive pun), the narrator goes on to suggest that the fish—understood as a token and gift of nature—may be used for almost any purpose, until "at last [one] cannot tell surely whether it be animal, vegetable, or mineral" (W, 120). In the end it comes out an "excellent dun fish for a Sunday ' s dinner"—but that is arguably far from speaking its living experience and form. These are rather erased by human handling. Summing up his discussion of the cargo, Thoreau echoes his assertion on the fate of books in a commercial environment: "While these things go up other things come down" ( W, 121). His final observation comes to him as a personal message: he looks up from the leaves of his book to catch sight of their stately origin—a tall northern pine. This serves him as a stern reminder of his debt and obligation to nature. Succeeding the freight train comes another bearing cattle and sheep. This gives the impression of "a pastoral valley . . . going by," and again illustrates Thoreau's awareness of the complexity of his chosen task (W, 121-22). For he himself, as a writer, would be a pastoral drover of sorts—seeking to escort his language to peaceful pasture in nature's midst. But his own text denies the feasibility of such a scheme. The drovers are finding "their vocation gone," yet they still cling "to their useless sticks as their badge of office" (W, 122). Their pens, one could say, have dried up.87 The remaining choice for the writer, as mirrored by the fate of the shepherd dogs, presents itself as one between the domestic and wild. Either he may return to domesticity—and by implication to institutional society and its various machinery—"in disgrace," or he may lose himself running wild "with the wolf and the fox," thus forfeiting his calling to communicate. "[T]he pastoral life," the hope of a reconciliation with nature, is to Thoreau inexorably "whirled past and away" due to human industry. His immedi</page><page sequence="31">84 The Concord Saunterer ate retort can only be a retreat—to "get off the track and let the cars go by ' ( W, 122). Temporarily numbed by the overpowering force of the railroad, Thoreau exclaims: "Now that the cars are gone by, and the restless world with them... I am more alone than ever" ( W. 122). His perceived isolation notwithstanding, he is stubborn to explore other possibilities. He recalls the local town bells, whose chimes he says produce a "natural melody, worth importing into the wilderness" (W., 123). The necessary condition is found to be distance; indeed, as he maintains, "[a]ll sound heard at the greatest possible distance produces one and the same effect, a vibration of the universal lyre" ( W, 123). With ample room for resonance a sound will be modu lated, we are told, yet not in a contaminating way. It will rather, as the bell chimes are felt to illustrate, "converse . . . with every leaf and needle of the wood" ( W, 123). Attending to far-off sound in such a way, one might hear it graced with an addition to, rather than subtraction from, its original character. And while this modulated sound is often residual, "[t]he echo is, " Thoreau asserts, "to some extent ... an original sound, and therein is the magic and charm of it. It is not merely a repetition of what was worth repeating in the bell, but partly the voice of the wood" ( W, 123). And so there is once again hope, it seems, of a reconciliation between the wild and civilized. As if to immediately reinforce this possibility, the writer recalls having confused some youths' singing with "the cheap and natural music of the cow": so much so, in fact, that the sounds finally seemed "one articulation of Nature" ( W, 123). Thoreau s following passages on owls and bullfrogs broaden and ex pound this newly-voiced theory. His humorous attempts to capture the sounds of these animals simultaneously play with the burden of metaphor and the lure of pathetic fallacy. His owls, for instance, "take up [a] strain . . . like mourning women their ancient u-lu-lu," being representative wailers for mankind—"Oh-o o-o-o that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n\" (W, 124-25). But this does not exhaust their calls' significance. The owls also suggest "a vast and undeveloped nature which men have not recognized" (W, 125). This is a distinction Thoreau sees fit to repeat in his closing paragraph on the nocturnal raptors. There is thus a persistent oscillation between the familiar (or familiarized) and the other in the owls' sound; between what can be rationalized and grasped in words, and what cannot. This debate continues with Thoreau's portrayal of chanticleer, his clarion bird. He praises its crowing alertness as remarkable, while adding that it was once a wild bird in India. The question he puts to us is if it "could be naturalized without being domesticated" (W, 127)? In other words, could it, given its present circum stances, be de-domesticated to live a more natural life? And so, by implication, could Walden's writer shed his shackles of domesticity and become invigorated in turn? His explicit project, after all, positions itself alongside chanticleer's, as he is careful to inform us. And a successful reorientation, we are told, would have the power of putting "nations on the alert," making them truly "healthy, wealthy, and</page><page sequence="32">Henrik Gustafsson 85 wise (W, 127). Importantly, Thoreau's focus has become more personal. His subtext here is less concerned with the potential of writing than a possible enrollment of Walden s author as a human prophet. Having gradually conceded to the domesticity of his language in the latter half of "Sounds," Thoreau successively realizes his task as one of renaturalization. Appropriately enough, he "kept neither dog, cat, cow, pig, nor hens, so that you would have said there was a deficiency of domestic sounds" around the house (W, 127). He describes his immediate environs upon concluding the chapter: No yard! but unfenced Nature reaching up to your very sills. A young forest growing up under your windows, and wild sumachs and blackberry vines break ing through into your cellar; sturdy pitch-pines rubbing and creaking against the shingles for want of room, their roots reaching quite under the house. Instead of a scuttle or a blind blown off in the gale, —a pine tree snapped off or torn up by the roots behind your house for fuel. Instead of no path to the front-yard gate in the Great Snow,—no gate, —no front-yard,—and no path to the civilized world! (W, 128) The distinction between nature and dwelling is here deliberately blurred; the sumac and blackberry no longer slough in self-contentment but rather prop up the writer's abode. Their roots reach "quite under the house"—and so Thoreau indirectly legitimates his own "burrowing" once again. And the plant life sur rounding his cabin is indeed beneficial—here not merely capable of tearing off "blinds" but also of generating "fuel." But Thoreau's concluding passage also seeks to settle and check some of his chapter's speculations. Despite his imaginative attempts of bringing nature and language together, Thoreau the writer's task remains—in an absolute sense— futile. Mediation between the realms of nature and civilization may be possible, but never without compromising the integrity of the former. Indeed, while the railroad may have its brave and direct progression, carving a track through the Great Snow (cf. W, 119), nature will not allow the writer such passage. Thoreau cannot hoist nature onto the cars to town and print. That journey is his alone.88 "NOT WHOLLY INVOLVED IN NATURE": THE BELATEDNESS &amp; DIS TANCE OF WRITING Thoreau's final gesture in "Sounds" can hence be read as one of resigna tion—or, with equal validity, as one of positive yielding. Boundaries are erased, the rhetoric relaxed. Nature literally engulfs the house, and also, perhaps, its writer. Conspicuously, in this last paragraph Thoreau's "I" is omitted. Instead he gives us "Nature reaching up ... to your sills," vines "breaking into your cellar,"</page><page sequence="33">86 The Concord Saunterer and a pine falling 'behind your house (my emphases). This loosens the chapter's character of personal testimony in favor of general declamation, and so it also broaches the curt acknowledgement following in "Solitude," where the narrator abruptly maintains (no longer anxious to show us exactly how) that "I go and come with a strange liberty in Nature, a part of herself' (W, 129). In and of itself, the latter statement is at once trivial and weighty. Trivial in its mundane obvious ness—Thoreau needs nature's blessing to live—but profound in its implication for his writing.89 In living he may be unique and, as he says, at "liberty," but in writing he is bound to be common, civilized, cultivating.90 His use of writing groups him with other writers, with their language constructs and works. His writing will not bridge any real gap. At best, his life may, but not his words as such. "My life has been the poem I would have writ,/ But I could not both live and utter it," as he verses elsewhere (A Week, 343). And so, in "Sounds," Thoreau admits to chuck ling for himself, to temporarily forsaking work, and to letting his life itself "become my amusement. . . never [ceasing] to be novel" (W, 112; note pun91). Writing, as thinking, lets us be "beside ourselves" as Thoreau further declares ( W, 134). Thus we "stand aloof from actions and their consequences.... We are not wholly involved in Nature" (W, 134-35). Writing, in this sense, becomes a trailing collector of experience: ordering it, culling it, submitting it to language. And writing so also becomes other to life: it yields an account, a history, rather than live action. On a structural level Thoreau partly succeeds in masking this condition by giving Walden a seasonal rather than linear progression. His prose tends to myth as much as to history. But writing Walden, as we know, involved a painstaking process of revision, a constant effort to weld disparate experiences together. The extant journal notebooks furnishing Walden with mate rial give ample evidence of Thoreau's obstacles, as Lawrence Buell has observed: consecutiveness, fragmentariness and a predilection for catalogue rhetoric.92 With out a tight ordering principle, the book might snap to present a spread of randomly recorded events. As it is, however, Thoreau's seasonal structure endows Walden with what Burbick has aptly called "a continual return to promise" {Alternate History, 13).93 As another structural "defense," one might also argue for Walden's dialectical character, its constant willingness to discuss or display itself and its doings, prompting the reader to study it ever more carefully. Yet I would suggest that Thoreau felt troubled over the issue of writing also beyond structural and dialogical concerns. A dichotomy between writing and life seems acutely felt in the following passage from "Solitude:" "However intense my experience, I am conscious of the presence and criticism of a part of me, which, as it were, is not a part of me, but spectator, sharing no experience, but taking note of it; and that is no more I than it is you. When the play, it may be the tragedy, of life is over, the spectator goes his way. It was a kind of fiction, a work of the imagination only, as far as he was concerned" (W, 135). There is thus the Thoreau that lives ("my [intense] experience"), and the Thoreau that writes</page><page sequence="34">Henrik Gustafsson 87 ("taking note of it"). Read as an instance of vocational insight and confession this statement bores deep. Arguably, what Thoreau wishes to settle here is a question of (biographical) self versus (written) persona: the two are separate, yet intimately related. The writer is a spectator retroactively involved in the immediate experi ence of life's real participant. "Sounds," to my mind, deserves to be read in light of a similar self recognition. Nothing could be simpler than to string its metaphors—its locomo tives drumming like partridges or screaming like hawks, its melancholy owls, its glassy pond—like a noose around the writer's neck, pronouncing him guilty of hoax and false promises: Where is pure nature?94 Yet Thoreau has in fact left clues to his obstacles all along, while constantly testing the issue of his writing from new angles.95 WALDEN'S LATER CHAPTERS: TOWARD THE DEEP CUT The Walden chapters succeeding "Sounds" and "Solitude' echo sponta neously with the writer's earlier aesthetic debates, as a few examples will suffice to show. In "The Bean Field" Thoreau ostensibly cultivates beans "for the sake of tropes and expression," deftly proclaiming his patch a "connecting link between wild and cultivated fields" (W, 162; 158). Henry Golemba sees this as a double irony, the beans not being raised as the writer's aliment but rather for the grocery market, and further in that "[o]ne cannot look upon a text or a field and not try to "appropriate' it, to make it one's property, to give it order, structure, and coher ence" (Wild Rhetoric, 201 ; 202). Yet both of these critiques seem to be anticipated by Thoreau. He openly concedes his action will yield a "half-cultivated" field, and that the resulting beans are primarily for his own benefit, both financial and spiritual. In "The Village" the writer's town takes on a hue of hell. It is rendered a site of "dirty institutions," whose vitals consist of "the grocery, the bar-room, the post-office, and the bank; and, as a necessary part of the machinery, ... a bell, a big gun, and a fire-engine" (W, 171; 168). The chapter, as John Hildebidle observes, is "not about the village but about escaping from it": "Having investi gated the world of 'machines,' of lines, lanes, traps, and bizarre but clear-cut orderings . . . Thoreau launches himself . . . into the woods" (Naturalist's Liberty, 112). And, one could add, the woods here only superficially remind of Dante's or Bunyan's. Rather than indicate a negative sense of dislocation, with Thoreau the adjacent forest ushers in an appreciation of "the vastness and strangeness of Nature"—provided, of course, that one "has lost the [infernal] world" of civiliza tion behind (W, 171). "House-Warming," in its thematic of warmth and fire, evokes issues of authenticity. Early on, the writer confides that "it is so much .. . wholesomer to be warmed by the sun while you can be, than by an artificial fire" (W, 240). Later,</page><page sequence="35">88 The Concord Saunterer however, as winter sets in, he endeavors "to keep a bright fire both within my house and within my breast"—a metaphorical link made somewhat tenuous by his previous assertion (W, 249). The next time fire is discussed, it is not surprisingly as a separate, potentially hostile entity: "It was I and Fire that lived [in the house]; and commonly my housekeeper proved trustworthy" (W, 253; my emphasis). When the second winter arrives, so does a stove. Having decided in favor of security and economy of fuel, the narrator nevertheless seems to realize a decided loss in his favoring of the civilized: "Cooking was then, for the most part, no longer a poetic, but merely a chemic process" (W, 254). A later chapter, "The Pond in Winter, introduces the notion that "Nature puts no question and answers none which we mortals ask," but then abruptly proceeds to both chronicle and visually display the narrator's successful sounding of Walden's submerged topography (W, 282; 285-90). Returning to the issue again in "Spring," the narrator nevertheless maintains that "[a]t the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of Nature" (W, 317-18). Yet an opposite tendency remains equally obstinate. Again in "The Pond in Winter," Thoreau muses that "[i]f we knew all the laws of Nature, we should need only one fact, or the description of one actual phenomenon, to infer all the particular results at that point" (W, 290). This relates directly to a Romantic quest for a key to nature, and Thoreau recalls it when examining the Deep Cut in "Spring:" "it seemed that this one hillside illustrated the principle of all the operations of Nature. The Maker of this earth but patented a leaf' (W, 308). The search for a unifying law also recalls the issue of a rock bottom first voiced in "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For." Thoreau returns repeatedly to it. In "House-Warming" the elated writer finds ground-nut ("[c]ultivation has well nigh exterminated it") when digging for fish-worms. "This tuber," Thoreau writes, "seemed like a faint promise of Nature to rear her own children and feed them simply here at some future period" (W, 239). Convinced that heaven also resides under his feet, he goes on to quote Ovid's Metamorphoses in "Spring"—a passage speculating that man may possibly originate from earth, from "some seeds of cognate heaven" (W, 314). To be grounded in place, and to dig for truth, in such light become hopeful projects anew. Nature s truth is arguably the platform Thoreau constantly seeks for his writing. "[T]here are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre" he asserts in "Economy," thus illustrating a freedom that still claims a focal, or pivotal, point from which it would ideally spring (W, 11). This is important to recall when reading his exhortation in "Conclusion:" "I desire to speak some where without bounds; like a man in a waking moment, to men in their waking moments; for I am convinced that I cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the</page><page sequence="36">Henrik Gustafsson 89 foundation of a true expression" (W, 324). Thoreau yearns for a redeemed lan guage, a language free of confusion or doubt, that has truth as its governing ideal. For there is, as he concludes, "a solid bottom every where" ( W, 330). At the Deep Cut of "Spring," Thoreau at last evinces his Mother-lode without having to dig. Several critics see this as the prime epiphany of Walden, where Thoreau's hopes and intuitions are granted in full. And indeed the Deep Cut furnishes a culmination of sorts, which Gura summarizes well: "Thoreau believed that man did not have to get anywhere; he was there already, surrounded by the literal ground of being from which he sprang and to which he would return. The analogies between words and things taught him that what correspondence they possessed was not to be understood as raising man to a higher realm of truth but served rather to alert him to the wonder of his sensuous worldly experience" (Words, 137-38). As a reminder of the validity of the writer's quest the Cut undoubtedly serves its function, but does his encountering its transformation present an unequivocal triumph?96 Quoting Thoreau's passages on the sandbank, Gura is bold enough to conclude that "Walden . . . tells the tale of Thoreau's reimmersion in the oldest fount of man's inspiration, nature's original language" (Words, 138).97 I would suggest that there is an irony to both the name and location that demands attention. The "deep cut" suggests a sizeable wound to nature; a wound kept open by regular slashing.98 What grows here is destined to be stunted or curtailed by the railroad's assured right-of-way. As if in anticipation of such critique, yet in seeming acknowledgement, Thoreau does not venture to discuss actual organic life springing up on the bank: the forms he depicts are instead imaginary, suggested to him by the various effusions of sand." Indeed, one could pose further questions: to what extent is the writer's Deep Cut natural; or, inversely, to what degree does it not owe its existence to the railroad? Is it not equally track structure—a human causeway—and a natural sandbank? As the writer himself concedes, the Cut's surface patterns also recall "the slag of a furnace, showing that Nature is 'in full blast' within"—in other words, the Cut's function can be likened to that of a locomotive engine (W, 308 9) 100 Indeed, railroad technology looms at the rim of almost every overt or submerged discussion of language in Walden. It threatens influence in much the same way as its tracks prove ominously tangential to the writer's physical domain. The railroad's latter trait has been famously explored by Leo Marx, while H. Daniel Peck has since called renewed attention to "Walden's pervasive mode of adjacency or deflection" in facing the railroad's challenge.101 Peck argues that the railroad's "lines of force" on Thoreau's published Walden map "are drawn aslant, deflected away from the pastoral center of the picture," and hence he indirectly supplements Marx's earlier conclusion that—in Peck's words—with the Deep Cut a "technological image is [conclusively] transformed into an organic one"</page><page sequence="37">90 The Concord Saunterer ("Crosscurrents," 82; 78; cf. Marx s Machine, 261). Consequently, one might argue that the bank presents a successful process of renaturalization (combining defensive deflection and active immersion), perfectly aligned to Thoreau's con cluding intentions in "Sounds." Yet I would maintain that the Deep Cut is not fully redemptive. It also points to a condition in which nature is bound by civilization and where language must ultimately confess its status as a technology. In "Sounds," the railroad's "orbit does not look like a returning curve" (my emphasis)—but indeed it is, both in Walden and elsewhere (W, 116). An earlier critic has suggested that this railroad image "describes [a] way out of the earth and its civilization," ironically pointing heavenward (Redemptive, 207). But the iron horse does return, again and again, to disturb the writer and his projects. Its tracks are embossed on the landscape, and tower over the fragile palimpsest of sand patterns and foliage Thoreau finds below. And the former will, in comparison, inevitably seem "the fine print, the small type" like the tracks of the deer mouse the writer stumbles upon in "Winter Visitors" (W, 267).102 More importantly, perhaps, the Deep Cut passage renders a focus on direct experience, on witnessing and so imaginatively participating in a unique occasion: "The earth is not a mere fragment of dead history, stratum upon stratum like the leaves of a book, to be studied by geologists and antiquaries chiefly, but living poetry like the leaves of a tree, which precede flowers and fruit,—not a fossil earth, but a living earth" (W, 309). Thoreau thus reminds us of the interval between writing and living, between the historian's struggle with "dead" events (which also becomes the writer's plight) and nature's burgeoning life. With the Deep Cut, to countermand history, Thoreau parallels the "new Mythology" he has evoked earlier regarding the locomotive. Here a side of the bank is mythologized as the laboratory and nursery of nature. Yet both images leave the reader slightly unnerved. As related to the writer's geography, both actual and textual, the railroad leaves an ineradicable imprint. It suggests that neither Thoreau's redemp tive imagination nor his writing can free itself from technological influence.103 LOCOMOTIVENESS : THE MACHINE IN THOREAU'S LATER WRIT INGS Beyond Walden, and into his last years, the railroad continued to chal lenge Thoreau both sensuously and as a symbol of pervasive industrialization. During his 1861 journey to Minnesota, he drafted a letter to his family from Niagara Falls, where he stopped a few days with his companion: "Horace Mann asked me if I had not heard the sound of the Falls as we went from the depot to the hotel last night. But I had not, though certainly it was loud enough. I had probably mistaken it for a train coming or a locomotive letting off steam—of which we have so much at home. ... As I sit in my chamber the impression is as if I were</page><page sequence="38">Henrik Gustafsson 91 surrounded by many factories in full steam."104 As an echo both of "Sounds" and of The Maine Woods, the railroad's latent effect on Thoreau's hearing apparently remained a concern.105 Here the rushing falls have been mistaken for a train, Thoreau having temporarily become insensitive to natural sound. He also internal izes the perceptual distortion as a metaphorical analogy, and so technology nestles into his figurative language. In a more confident and aggressive text like "Walking ' ( 1862), Thoreau initially seems to reverse the railroad's advantage. He flaunts a keen irony at the technology's expense with a new-coined metaphor: Any sportiveness in cattle is unexpected. I saw one day a herd of a dozen bullocks and cows running about.... They shook their heads, raised their tails, and rushed up and down a hill, and I perceived by their horns, as well as by their activity, their relation to the deer tribe. But, alas! a sudden loud Whoa! would have damped their ardor at once, reduced them from venison to beef, and stiffened their sides and sinews like the locomotive. Who but the Evil One has cried "Whoa!" to mankind? Indeed, the life of cattle, like that of many men, is but a sort of locomotiveness; they move a side at a time, and man, by his machinery, is meeting the ox and horse halfway. Whatever part the whip has touched is thenceforth palsied. Who would ever think of a side of any of the supple cat tribe, as we speak of a side of beef? (Portable, 618-19) Thus Thoreau links freedom of spirit and motion with wildness. Men, he says, are like cattle too domesticated to appreciate such virtues. They are either paralyzed or voluntarily restrict themselves to regulated movements. Aesthetically, the passage also shows how Thoreau internalizes a physical observation of technol ogy into a mock-literary trope: "locomotiveness." While the joke is certainly at the engine's expense, its apparition importantly reaches into—and influences—the writer's sense of perception and choice of symbolism for a wider moral context. Thoreau's concept of man falling into ruts is strong in "Walking. Our regular progression of life, our commodities and tools, he warns, will soon distract us from nobler pursuits: "When, at rare intervals, some thought visits one, as perchance he is walking on a railroad, then, indeed, the cars go by without his hearing them. But soon, by some inexorable law, our life goes by and the cars return" (Portable, 624). This distraction was not a new theme with Thoreau, rather one that he chose to vary over time. The journal of February 27, 1851, for instance, has him sensing how "the shadow of the wings of a thought flits across the landscape of my mind. . . . But this shadow ... is so soon past" (Journal 3, 200). To illustrate his frustration, Thoreau turns to the railroad: "[Cars] stop &amp; we get into them. But those sublime thoughts passing on high do not stop &amp; we never get into them. Their conductor is not like one of us." To this is added a moral: "I feel that the man</page><page sequence="39">92 The Concord Saunterer who in his conversation with me about the life of man in New England lays much stress on rail-roads telegraphs &amp; such enterprises does not go below the surface of things— He treats the shallow &amp; transitory as if it were profound and enduring" (.Journal 3, 200). But Thoreau's own metaphor shows us how technology indeed reaches "below the surface of things"—as he himself chooses to correlate higher thoughts with trains passing a station. The conductor of these higher thoughts, however—whether understood literally or symbolically—does not pause to grasp our attention or prompt our memory. The railroad would prove an enduring theme in Thoreau's writings. His last recorded journal entry, from November 3, 1861, describes wind tracks left on his local causeway (Journal #14, 346). While the later journal discusses the technology's effects on landscape in at times objective terms, its general image remains troubling, unresolved. Thoreau's friend and walking companion Channing has left a telling record of Thoreau's last illness, testifying as to how finally "[w]ords could no longer express these inexplicable conditions of his existence, this sickness which reminded him of nothing that went before: such as that dream he had of being a railroad cut, where they were digging through and laying down the rails,—the place being in his lungs."106 SUMMARY: TRACKING THE RAILROAD AND PEN I have called Thoreau s approach to technology dialectical in this essay. I find it so in the sense that it continually relates to his evolving ideas about society, nature, and writing. I have not considered Thoreau the instrumental critic, though that man doubtless also existed: the commentator on surveying efficiency, the admirer of canoes and batteaux, the improver of pencil manufacture. My focus, though necessarily flexible, has gravitated toward the railroad, as that technology in particular both influenced Thoreau over the years and elicited interested com ment from him. But in what sense is a dialectical process reflected by Thoreau's attitude toward technology? From a literary viewpoint, his development of a machine metaphor is a case in point. It germinates in Thoreau's review of Etzler's machine Utopia, where his instinct pits the forces of nature and man's morality against the German's vision. Later, in "Resistance to Civil Government," Thoreau's new understanding of a "machine mentality" lets him illustrate men as machines, and by extension also their State. Hiding the moral muscle developed against Etzler until his described jailing, Thoreau delivers a powerful rhetorical punch to his government upon release. Beyond conscience, Thoreau's moral message now incorporates self-government as a valuable trait. Later yet a similar strategy is put to work in Walden, where men— especially farmers and railroad workers—are rendered machine-like, yet Thoreau's</page><page sequence="40">Henrik Gustafsson 93 goal tends more clearly toward reform of selt than government at this juncture. In each case the concept of "machine" is broadened and deepened, internalized into Thoreau's aesthetics to prove an efficient argumentative tool. But the railroad itself is a more complicated case in many ways. It soon becomes clear that its significance to Thoreau varies over time. In Walden, its presence is in a basic sense physical. The narrator is disturbed by it, and feels forced to distance himself from the tracks and causeway when the locomotive nears. Later on he realizes that the freight train may furnish his retreat with sights from the outside world, boosting its status as a kernel of a larger whole. The railroad thus seems to transform from a malign force to a benign one—culminat ing, so read, with the writer's fond examinations of sand patterns at the Deep Cut. With Thoreau's commitment in "Sounds" to attempt a chaste marriage of the realms of nature (sounds) and civilization (language), however, the railroad's frequent appearance comes to suggest a dark force undermining such notions. It comes to reflect civilization as a spectrum of negations: as a "machine mentality"; as a symbol of technological virus (which in turn infects every instrument, from locomotive to pen); as a fate of language in the face of nature. At one point Thoreau even resorts to invoking a champion for aid against "the bloated pest," but this, of course, is a vain hope (W, 192). Hydra-like, the railroad always presents a new-fanged head to meet the writer-protagonist. He struggles to meet the various metamorphoses the railroad undergoes. One strategy, which imbues "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For" and "Spring," is a mythologizing of the locomotive and Deep Cut. Neither attempt, as I have tried to show, is fully successful. Mythologizing would be a way of naturalizing—and thus of removing history—from both entities, letting them blend into seamless landscape. But both are too wound up with current affairs, and also with Thoreau's implicit doubts as to his powers of expression and transformation—even as these powers are flaunted by his narrative persona. Indeed, Thoreau stages a broad strategy of renaturalization to comple ment his complex mythology. He wishes to call attention to the proximity of his metaphors to his life at the pond. He hoes beans for tropes and expression, digs a cellar for a store of words as well as aliment, and puts his writing desk and tools symbolically out of doors. All these measures are variable ways of searching to bridge what is seen as a gap between nature and culture. Thoreau hopes, it seems, that such a bridge would redeem language from its perceived condition of deprav ity, from its relinquishment of meaning for effect, and of value for salability. The writer thus wishes to move beyond the secrets of his trade (which he has already mastered) to the secrets of nature. Not content to be a "mechanical" writer, he wants to "speak somewhere without bounds." Walden shows us his splendid attempts, but as technology reaches into his craft, and insofar as he is forced to recognize this, he can only make a retreat. Eventually he posits a mystical immersion in nature: "I go and come ... in Nature, a part of herself." But</page><page sequence="41">94 The Concord Saunterer he cannot fully communicate his experience to the reader. To follow Thoreau beyond this juncture implies an leap of faith.107 One should perhaps also, in this context, keep in mind that Thoreau s struggles to conceptualize nature did not stop with Walden. He had several more projects underway: among them to school himself as a naturalist-scientist. Several of his later writings in this vein—notably the essays collected and edited by Bradley P. Dean as Faith in a Seed and Wild Fruits—propose "proto-ecologist" understandings of nature that broaden and complement the stances of Thoreau's earlier book.108 Also, as demonstrated by Walden's discussions of aesthetic premises, Thoreau seems almost uncannily geared to modern theorizing on the subject. Consider, for example, how Theodor W. Adorno frames the problem of "natural beauty"—a secular derivation of what Thoreau would call "Nature." "The concept of natural beauty rubs on a wound, and little is needed to prompt one to associate this wound with the violence that the artwork—a pure artifact—inflicts on nature. Wholly artificial, the artwork seems to be the opposite of what is not made."109 The nucleus of the hurt, as Adorno sees it, would arguably find resonance also with Thoreau: "Through its duplication in art, what appears in nature is robbed of its being-in-itself, in which the experience of nature is fulfilled" (Aesthetic Theory, 67). Yet Thoreau, of course, would not use his insights as pessimistically as Adorno, and would surely not concede his work "wholly artificial." But there is a play in Walden, and especially an undercurrent in "Sounds," that runs against the generally triumphant tone of its narrator. The transparent language he strives for proves a mirage. "The vanishing point," as Adorno adds of our rationality, "is the insight that nature . . . cannot be copied" (Aesthetic Theory, 67). I would suggest that Thoreau verges on this realization in Walden, although his narrative voice stubbornly refuses to succumb to its implications. Only later could he openly confide such a possibility to his journal. On October 14, 1857, a sentence reads: "I doubt if you can ever get Nature to repeat herself exactly."110 CONCLUSIONS: DEFIANCE &amp; ENTZAUBERUNG In one of the finest comprehensive studies of Thoreau to date, Reginald L. Cook identified the writer's distrust of "technological civilization" as fourfold. It involved skepticism of an "artificial urbanized environment" and division of labor, as well as an outright opposition against "machine servility" and "standard ization"—recognizing the latter as "invidious in the development of the human personality."111 What Thoreau s many encounters with the machine also suggest is that he gradually came to realize its profound reach within the human community. Technology, if he would have traced the word back long enough, would have</page><page sequence="42">Hennk Gustafsson 95 spoken of its presence also in language. Techne, Greek for skill or learning in craft or art, is married to logos: word, speech. Thus, its original meaning was akin to "the science of craft"—where craft might involve words or speech (rhetoric) as well as things tangible."2 By extrapolation, writing would by definition incur on nature much like a railroad: cutting out its tracks, its causeways, undermining the text's potential to "turn aside" and communicate higher truth. Thoreau, of course, could joke with "locomotiveness," pun playfully on "sleepers" and "industriousness," even embrace such technology as pleased him. Initially elated at the telegraph as a "magic medium of communication" and "poetry of the RR," for example, he asked in his 1851 journal if we should not add "a 10th muse to the immortal nine? . . . that the invention [be] thus divinely honored &amp; distinguished—on which the muse has condescended to smile" (Jour nal 4, 90; 383). But the aspect of the telegraph Thoreau later appreciated was something beyond the ordinary, as Joan Burbick has noted: its function as an "aeolian lyre, transmitting the wild music of the wind," i.e. a vauntedly natural sound, yet "ironically through the wires of an industrializing landscape," (Alter nate History, 162, n. 9). The other, human transmission the technology furnished was soon merely a "whooping cough" to the writer (W, 52). Thoreau would become considerably more cautious in portioning praise over man's technological innovations. As their reach into his own consciousness and craft dawned upon him, his writing became increasingly dialectic—and arguably defensively so. For his perception and penwork, collectively in pursuit of an elusive nature, could not fully describe their goal—only mystically declare it, or perhaps channel into another, more scientific mode of expressing its qualities. Thus a "tenth muse," as understood in broader technological terms, would not find enduring welcome in Thoreau's ideal pantheon. Instead Pan—"not dead, as was rumored"—would retain a high seat (A Week, 65). Thoreau's journal entry of December 25, 1851, is a fitting conclusion. It speaks of a latent fear of démystification or disenchantment, a mood Max Weber would later call Entzauberung. A crucial aspect of the modern predicament, to Weber, is the sense that the world is losing its suggestiveness, that our increas ingly mechanistic perceptions and languages rob it of mystical charm. Surely Thoreau broached those concerns: If there is not something mystical in your explanation — something unexplain able — some element of mystery, it is quite insufficient. If there is nothing in it which speaks to my imagination — what boots it. What sort of science is that which enriches the understanding but robs the imagination.... Just as inadequate to a pure mechanic would be a poets account of a steam engine. If we knew all things thus mechanically merely — should we know anything really? (Journal 4, 222)</page><page sequence="43">96 The Concord Saunterer Notes 1 The etymological history of "iron horse," according to several standard dictionaries, is brief. The expression probably originated in America in the 1820s or 1830s. The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2d ed., New York: Random House, 1983) places the origin between 1825 and 1835 (1008). H. L. Mencken, in his The American Language: An Inquiry into the Development of English in the United States (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1949), sees the expression as an instance of "imaginativeness revealed by Americans in meeting linguistic emergencies, in seek ing names for new objects introduced by the building of railroads ... in the [ 18]30's" (146-47). 2 Roderick Nash, Wilderness and the American Mind (3d ed., New Haven &amp; London: Yale Univ. Press, 1982), "The Romantic Wilderness" and "The American Wilder ness," 44-83. 3 See Leo Marx, The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in America (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1964); his The Pilot and the Passenger: Essays on Literature, Technology, and Culture in the United States (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1988); and his essay "The Railroad-in-the-Landscape: An Iconological Reading of a Theme in American Art" in The Railroad in American Art: Representations of Technological Change, ed. Susan Danly and Leo Marx (Cam bridge, Mass.; MIT Press, 1988). Subsequent references to Machine, Pilot and Rail road are cited parenthetically in the text. 4 Indeed, a critique of the myth could be seen as embedded already within Puritanism itself. As Peter N. Carroll argues in Puritanism and the Wilderness: The Intellectual Significance of the New England Frontier 1629-1700 (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1969), the Puritans landed with an unclear social agenda. On the one hand was an ideal of a fortified "city on a hill," on the other a realization that "a collective society [would] lay the seeds of its [own] destruction" (3). From this tension between a cohesive and expansive tendency, conflicting ideas about nature were bound to ensue. Alan Heimert's "Puritanism, the Wilderness, and the Frontier," New England Quarterly 26 (1953): 361-82, by contrast, would contest Carroll's positing the above ideas as arising simultaneously, yet concur with an eventually arising ideological strain. 5 In Civilizing the Machine: Technology and Republican Values in America, 1776 1990 (1976; rpt. New York: Penguin, 1984), John F. Kasson argues that the dominant ideology of Republicanism was successively linked to machine industry during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. "Particularly after the introduction of the rail road," he maintains, "Americans increasingly identified the progress of the nation with the progress of technology." As a consequence, the populace "glorified machines not simply as functional objects but as signs and symbols of the future" (41) in a general vision of a "technological sublime" (165-68). A recent view which challenges Kasson's is Leo Marx's, in Railroad, 192-93. Marx maintains that both resistance to— and fear of—technology were more widespread, albeit covert. An important point on which Marx and Kasson agree, however, is that the dominant American culture of the nineteenth century favored technological development, and that the vocal resistance it met came mainly from a minority of contemporary artists and intellectuals.</page><page sequence="44">Henrik Gustafsson 97 6 Cf. Wilson O. Clough, The Necessary Earth: Nature and Solitude in American Literature (Austin: Univ. of Texas Press, 1964), on Emerson's, Thoreau's, and Whitman's comments to this effect (99). 7 Perry Perry Perry to a related conclusion in "Nature and the National Ego," included in Errand into the Wilderness (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1956), 204 16. He there summarizes "the problem of American self-recognition as ... essentially an irreconcilable opposition between Nature and civilization—which is to say, be tween forest and town, spontaneity and calculation, heart and head, the unconscious and the self-conscious, the innocent and the debauched" (208). Miller goes so far as to suggest that "[Nature], in [nineteenth-century] America, . . . served not so much for individual or artistic salvation as for an assuaging of national anxiety" (211). Nature was frequently pitted, he maintains, against the "contamination] by artificiality" (211) that was commonly seen to ensue from "organized religion along with organized civilization" (216). While many later critics would want to qualify Miller's way of depicting a "Nature sentiment" as singularly dominant, his analysis of the contempo rary artist's dilemma arguably reflects a central worry of Thoreau's. 8 I will employ a broad definition of technology as involving a conscious human reorganizing, by whatever cultural tool—tangible or linguistic—of the "natural" world, with the latter understood as a given environment (cf. note 65 below). "Nature" in Thoreau's sense is arguably the appropriate polar term, constantly prone to change (or elude) in an ongoing negative dialectic with technology. His "Nature" hovers between sign and object, meaning and function, internality and externality. Jane Bennett has eloquently framed this set of conflicts: "Nature is neither Thoreau's product nor the object he discovers; Thoreau neither creates from scratch nor merely records what is there before his recognition of it. Nature ... is presented as too enmeshed with us to be a truth, and too much of a [moral] source to qualify as a fiction" (61).

Like Robert Milder in his recent Reimagining Thoreau (Cambridge, Mass: Cambridge Univ.

(Subsequent references to Reimagining Thoreau are given parenthetically in the text.) Lawrence Buell presents a forceful argument for a reconstituted authorial criticism in The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Na ture Writing, and the Formation of American Culture (Cambridge, Mass., &amp; London: Harvard Univ. Press, 1995). See esp. his "Text as Testament: Reading Walden for the Author," 370-95. Subsequent references to Environmental Imagination are cited parenthetically in the text. 11 Earlier studies of Thoreau's depiction of the Walden railroad have taken incidental notice of this question, notably Leo Marx's Machine, in discussing the "Sounds" chapter (253). An earlier study by G. Ferris Cronkhite, "The Transcendental Railroad" in the New England Quarterly 24 (1951): 306-28, while not focusing on Thoreau's language, gives valuable parallels to Thoreau's overall ambivalence by also highlight</page><page sequence="45">98 The Concord Saunterer ing responses of Emerson and Hawthorne. Joseph L. Basile's Man and Machine in Thoreau (Louisiana State Univ., Ph.D., 1972) follows Marx and Cronkhite very closely, adding little to their railroad discussions. Basile's broad focus is on Thoreau's concepts of "the ideal," "the wild," and "exaggeration" as artistic responses to con temporary society. Cheryl B. Torsney's "Learning the Language of the Railroad in Walden" m American Transcendental Quarterly 55 (1985): 19-28, offers the thesis (to which this study does not subscribe) that "the railroad and the pond [in Walden] are twin symbols offering alternate routes to transcendence" (19).

Richard Ruland (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1968), 9. 36 A constant risk in criticizing Thoreau is to blur the rhetorical divide between nature and civilization his texts posit on a manifest level (however unsuccessfully or ironi cally). Thus Frederick Garber, in an otherwise brilliant study, ascribes Thoreau's increasing diffulties with the concept of nature as due to "how the things of this world had become more and more resistant and independent," and further to "nature's inadequacies": nature would be held responsible by Thoreau for the tangible depletion of predators in the Concord landscape [Thoreau's Redemptive Imagination (New York: New York Univ. Press, 1977), 170-71; my emphases. Subsequent references to Redemptive are cited parenthetically in the text]. Clearly, as the records quoted by Thoreau indicate, man was responsible for the depletion of animals, and civilization— in a broader sense—ever implicated in the forms and processes of the local environ ment. Thoreau could not credibly maintain an all-encompassing nature: civilization in its various and powerful guises would too frequently disturb him, and indeed—as I will argue—influence and problematize his literary projects. 37 Quoted from "An Approach to Thoreau" in New Approaches to Thoreau: A Sympo</page><page sequence="47">100 The Concord Saunterer slum, ed. William Bysshe Stein (Hartford: Transcendental Books, 1969), 4. 38 In his Journal of November 9, 1858, Thoreau pursues the analogy of soil/language and plowing/writing to an unprecedented degree. Discussing how themes are to be chosen, he maintains that "It is a great art in the writer to improve from day to day just that soil and fertility which he has, to harvest that crop which his life yields. ... He should be digging, not soaring." Quoted from The Journal of Henry David Thoreau, Volume 1 I. July 1858-February 1859, ed. B. Torrey and F. H. Allen (rpt..

Subsequent references to Words are cited parenthetically in the text. Henry Golemba has recently argued for a "Problem Criticism" of Thoreau, maintaining his "language of desire" as one of determined indeterminacy, prone to leave the reader "to fill the gaps with his or her own meaning" [Thoreau's Wild Rhetoric (New York &amp; London: New York Univ. Press, 1990), 240, n. 10; 7. Subsequent references to Wild Rhetoric are cited parenthetically in the text]. He perceptively shows how Thoreau's aesthetic of describing nature involves "gaps," but why should these gaps by necessity point to "unmeaning"? And why, indeed, go so far as to maintain unequivocally that Thoreau "had concluded early in his writing career that nature, inspiring though it may be, was so vast and complex that it stood apart from human systems of meaning, and it eluded attempts to understand it" (225)? My own position with regard to these matters is closer to John Hildebidle's, who apropos Walden writes that it "is a book ... that not only contradicts but criticizes itself' [Thoreau: A Naturalist's Liberty (Cambridge &amp; London: Harvard Univ. Press, 1983), 109. Subsequent references to Naturalist's Liberty are cited parenthetically in the text], I take Hildebidle to suggest that Thoreau uses puns, paradoxes, and oxymorons ("contradicting") while also developing larger arguments and counter-arguments on a thematic level ("criticizing"). Rather than reduce Thoreau's texts to one or the other quality, to identify and discuss both tendencies seems a reasonable critic's ethic. 41 Michael West has since argued that Thoreau was influenced also by an array of eighteenth-century French theorists of language, supplementing his quest to "invent words for his perceptions" (768). See West's "Thoreau and the Language Theories of the French Enlightenment," ELH 51 (1984), 747-70. 42 My frequent, if mostly silent, indebtedness to Frederick Garber's Thoreau's Fable of Inscribing (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1991), will be evident to anyone familiar with this seminal work. Garber speaks of the burden of "secondariness" and "slippage" Thoreau's language struggles with, not least vis-à-vis nature (13; 18; 28; 77; 149). He frames the conflict with a number of dialectical categories: immediacy/ belatedness (33); fragementariness/ continuousness (102); nearness/ distance (157); humanizing/ naturalizing (124-25); internalizing/ externalizing (160-61; 200-201); uncivil/ civil ( 172-73 et passim), and then relates them to activities of desire in Thoreau: "inscrib</page><page sequence="48">Henrik Gustafsson 101 ing" (14 et passim) and "self-re-originating" (192), both elements seen as vital components of "at-homeness" in Heidegger's sense. With this in mind, it is hardly surprising that Garber sees Gura's "view of Thoreau on language" as one that shows the writer "far more confident" than in his own analysis (211, n. 8; subsequent references to Fable are cited parenthetically in the text.) The present essay would concur with this opinion, and also argue for a latent Thoreauvian distrust in his writing. 43 Reflection remained a concern of Thoreau's aesthetics during the time of Walden's conception. Compare his journal entry of May 23, 1853: "The poet must bring to Nature the smooth mirror in which she is to be reflected. He must be something superior to her, something more than natural. He must furnish equanimity. No genius will excuse him from importing the ivory which is to be his material" (Journal #5, 183-84). Note, also, how this passage glides from reflection to an implication of artistic influence: the ivory, once collected, is there to be carved. 44 Thoreau's skill in adapting his language to his natural environment is indeed impres sive, not least on a stylistic level. Victor Carl Friesen's chapter "Sauce to This World's Dish" (65-83) presents a lucid discussion of Thoreau's sensuous writing, identifying kinesthesia, synesthesia, and new coinages as crucial to Thoreau in forging a unique, vivid style striving "to familiarize the strange" (82). See Friesen's The Spirit of the Huckleberry: Sensuousness in Henry Thoreau (Edmonton: Univ. of Alberta Press, 1984). [For a clear discussion of Thoreau's general rhetorical techniques, see Richard Dillman's Essays on Henry David Thoreau: Rhetoric, Style, and Audience (West Cornwall: Locust Hill, 1993). Subsequent references to Rhetoric are cited parentheti cally in the text.] Frederick Garber, in turn, has shown how Thoreau's imagination strives to appropriate the wild by a number of dialectical measures, including totemizing, extra-vagance, fronting, and burrowing (Redemptive, "A Sort of Border Life," 36-65). Yet Thoreau will still find that "[njature's pure wildness is not only a threat to consciousness but ... its most exacting antagonist" (128). To Garber, Thoreau therefore has to settle for a role of mediator that is not entirely satisfying: the writer, he says, "concluded that consciousness . . . has to impose upon nature, but that nature should still be permitted to speak in its own way and for itself' ( 130). This contradic tion, when ramified to an aesthetic level, arguably reveals an impasse. Thoreau's writing must hence involve various "gestures toward accommodation" (128), while his philosophy will yield to the coda that "nature's value is autotelic as well as imagistic, in itself as well as in what it can represent for man" (198). This is another way of saying that nature-in-its-fullness is ultimately inaccessible to Thoreau's lan guage, whatever his desire to the contrary. 45 Gordon V. Boudreau, The Roots o/Walden and the Tree of Life (Nashville: Vanderbilt Univ. Press, 1990), 123. Subsequent references to Roots are cited parenthetically in the text. 46 I choose to primarily follow the railroad and the pen—arguably extreme poles in a chain of technologies applicable to Thoreau's experience as rendered in his texts. Thus I do not consider in any detail his housing, surveying, mapping, depth-sounding, spy glass observations, etc., although these of course all indicate instrumental ways of framing and molding perception and consequent linguistic expression. Other critics, notably Joan Burbick, Sharon Cameron and Frederick Garber, have discussed some of these aspects in detail.</page><page sequence="49">102 The Concord Saunterer 47 Charles Fiedelson, Jr., was sensitive to this problem in his Symbolism and American Literature (Chicago &amp; London: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1953): "Thoreau really cannot deal with 'the vision, the truth alone.' He must also deal with the subject and object which the vision lies 'between.' He cannot merely feel and speak, losing himself and nature in the experience and the word.... Thoreau is extremely aware that what he can present is not absolute experience but a relative fact—'my relation to nature'" (137). 48 Joan Burbick has also addressed this problem, arguing that Thoreau's redemptive concerns create linguistic difficulties. Language "must not be trapped within the historical"—a Thoreauvian demand that inevitably, Burbick reasons, creates "linger ing doubts about language as a transparent medium. The scene of writing can instead become a scene of distortion" [Thoreau's Alternative History: Changing Perspectives on Nature, Culture, and Language (Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1987), 54; 57. Subsequent references to Alternate History are cited parenthetically in the text]. 49 Indeed, my reading will contrast with those of critics inclined to emphasize a linguistic naiveté in Walden. John Carlos Rowe, for example, has argued that "Thoreau may employ language in Walden more cleverly than in any of his other works, but he scrupulously avoids the problematic of language itself," as if "the natural facts were sufficient for the grammar of our lives" ["The Being of Language: The Language of Being," rpt. in Modern Critical Views: Henry David Thoreau, ed. Harold Bloom (New York &amp; Philadelphia: Chelsea House, 1987), 147], In a somewhat different—but equally problematic—vein, Sharon Cameron has blamed various critics for "disre garding the alternatives [of Thoreau's perceived conflict between the social and natural] specified as exclusive" (161, n. 17). Her thesis is that Thoreau's Journal represents an extreme attempt to render the "natural" ("a passion for nature divorced from social meaning," 24), while Walden succumbs to the "social" and accommo dated. While I will not contest Cameron's argument that "the Journal . . . eschews anthropomorphism as adamantly as a work can" (147), her corresponding opinion that Walden—understood as a contrast—"civilizes" and "'represents]' nature ... in the social forms that are receptive to it" (23), strikes as only superficially relevant. To my view, Thoreau's language is inevitably imbued with the "social" (writing by definition being a "social" act), even when he strives for the "natural." Thus, while Thoreau's writing strategies indeed vary, maintaining a division between his modes of discourse along such lines seems unfruitful. Walden seen as an attempt at writing nature certainly differs from the Journal in strategy, but hardly in result. While the latter strives to eschew the figurative and ultimately fails, Walden, as I will argue, at once deplores and employs it in active dialectic. See Cameron's Writing Nature: Henry Thoreau's Journal (Chicago &amp; London: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1985). 50 Joseph J. Moldenhauer, "The Extra-vagant Maneuver: Paradox in Walden," as rpt. in Critical Essays on Henry David Thoreau's Walden, ed. Joel Myerson (Boston, G. K. Hall, 1988), 96-106 (103). Subsequent references to "Paradox" are cited parentheti cally in the text. 51 Other anticipations are of course possible, among them James Mcintosh's: '"Sounds' follows 'Reading' to show that men can learn not only from books but also from nature" (258), in Thoreau as Romantic Naturalist: His Shifting Stance toward Nature (Ithaca &amp; London: Cornell Univ. Press, 1974). Subsequent references to Romantic</page><page sequence="50">Henrik Gustafsson 103 Naturalist are cited parenthetically in the text. 52 The irony of this statement is that Thoreau did not himself abstain from traveling by train to nearby destinations. His business often took him to libraries in Cambridge and Boston. See my "Advent," 57-58. 53 J. Golden Taylor, Neighbor Thoreau's Critical Humor (Logan: Utah State Univ., 1958), 9. Indeed, one may complement Taylor's insight by arguing with David S. Reynolds that "Thoreau's imagistic violence and stabbing irony ... are precisely what bind him most tightly to his contemporaries, who were hardly complacent dreamers. Walden and the John Brown speech were Thoreau's most popular performances because of, not in spite of, their acidic attacks on conventions. By the early 1850s American readers were almost masochistically attracted to reform-minded writers of all varieties who used every weapon of invective and exaggeration to lay bare social corruption and propose ready-made solutions" (99). Reynolds concludes that "Thoreau wished to establish what he called 'true humor,' which, like popular humor, was grotesque but which had a fundamental seriousness and spiritual suggestiveness" (505). See Reynolds, Beneath the American Renaissance: The Subversive Imagina tion in the Age of Emerson and Melville (Cambridge &amp; London: Harvard Univ. Press, 1988). 54 Compare Frederick Garber in Fable, 111-12, who reasons that Thoreau shows the necessary limitation of a first-person perspective with this passage. 55 This question pervades a seminal article by Michael West, who in Thoreau's wordplay sees "[n]ot merely ... an American's attempt to nationalize the language, not merely ... an individual's attempt to transcend collective language, not merely ... an unhealthy attempt to flee from life to language—though there is truth in all these interpretations" (1061). Siding with Mark Van Doren, West holds that "Thoreau 'will come fully into his own when there is no one left who takes him literally'" (1061). Despite the precision of West's analysis, his conclusion strikes as somewhat blunt. Why should we read Thoreau for mere comic or ironic effects, when his writing more readily proves dialectical? Or, in other words, why must we suppose that Thoreau's text, given its wordplay, merely capitulates rather than persistently exposing and exploring options? See West's "Scatology and Eschatology: The Heroic Dimensions of Thoreau's Wordplay," in PMLA 89 (1974): 1043-64. 56 I am indebted to Joseph J. Moldenhauer's discussion of this passage. See his "Para dox," 103-5; for comparison also Cronkhite's "Transcendental Railroad." 320. 57 They thus closely resemble the morally ignorant soldiers in "Resistance to Civil Government," of whom it was held that "wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well" (Reform, 66). 58 Puns on the railroad occur at various places in Walden. Walter Harding has noted how, in the passage here discussed, the phrase "if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail" alludes to running a person out of town [Walden: An Annotated Edition, foreword and notes by Walter Harding (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1995), 89. Subsequent references to Annotated Walden are cited parenthetically in the text.] Cheryl Torsney notes another where Thoreau writes: "If the engine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains" (W, 97). See Torsney's "Language of the Railroad," 23 and 20, where she proposes of the latter quote that "the common name for the early locomotive itself, the iron horse, suggests its position in the natural chain." I would propose that the name goes only halfway, in keeping with the "iron" prefix.</page><page sequence="51">104 The Concord Saunterer 59 Thoreau would eventually pun on the word "sleepers" again. In a journal entry of November 21,1860, he tells of how he "[g]ot a section to-day of a white cedar railroad sleeper" (256), which displays an impressive average of 250 rings counted from opposite sides. Pondering the age of the wood, he concludes: "It was a flourishing young cedar . . . when the Pilgrims came over. Thus the cars on our railroad, and all their passengers, roll over the trunks of trees sleeping beneath them which were planted years before the first white man settled in New England" (257). Quoted from The Journal of Henry David Thoreau, Volume 14: August 1860-1861, ed. B. Torrey and F. H. Allen (rpt. Salt Lake City: Peregrine Smith, 1984). Subsequent references to Journal #14 are given parenthetically in the text. 60 As Harding has pointed out, trains of the period were easily derailed (Annotated Walden, 93). 61 Leonard N. Neufeldt, The Economist: Henry Thoreau &amp; Enterprise (New York &amp; Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1989), 169. For a perhaps surprising bolster, see the Fergensons' study in Thoreau's Psychology: Eight Essays, ed. Raymond Gozzi (Lanham, New York &amp; London: Univ. Press of America, 1983), 79-108 (95). 62 William J. Wolf has called attention to some of these ambiguities, listing as concilia tory acts Thoreau's use of a frame house and stove (which replaced an open fireplace during the second winter at Walden) as well as his accepting an aspect of the railroad: the latter "shattered the isolation of the pond" by furnishing a level and open track to the village. See Wolfs Thoreau: Mystic, Prophet, Ecologist (Philadelphia: United Church Press, 1974), 101-2. Further, Joan Burbick has convincingly argued that Thoreau's house, measuring instruments, and mapping in Walden serve to blur the rhetorically upheld "opposition between nature and civilization," and that the book on a deeper level "analyzes the material dimensions of culture and its effects on history, perception, and ultimately, language" (Alternate History, 59-60; see, for more gloss, her chapter "Views from the Walden Settlement," 59-82). Burbick's analysis, in turn, can be contrasted to Karl Kroeber's recent opinion that current literary criticism of Thoreau is misleading (his specific target being Buell's Environmental Imagination). We need to realize, Kroeber argues, that "nature and culture are not antithetical but mutually interdependent" (310). Kroeber ostensibly allies his statement to the doc trines of Deep Ecology, maintaining that "self-reversal [of criticism] demands a more than Copernican reassessment of the suicidal social values fostered by separating ourselves from nature and denying the naturalness of all cultures" (322). While few critics—least of all Buell—would disavow the validity of the first claim, holding that culture is natural strikes as either severely anachronistic or Utopian (that it should be natural is another matter). Yet Kroeber extends his critique to the linguistic, com plaining that today's critics "confine their attention to the realm of language regarded as a self-enclosed system whose referential functions do not matter" (323). See Kroeber's "Ecology and American Literature: Thoreau and Un-Thoreau" in ALH 9 (1997): 309-28. To my mind, a persistent dialectic between nature and culture—rather than a pretended synthesis—is one of the most interesting aspects of Thoreau's and later nature writers' work. While one can always discuss emphasis, accepting referentiality as unproblematic would blur both the inherent complexity and interest of their efforts. 63 Peter A.

Sundquist, Home as Found: Authority and Genealogy in Nineteenth-Century American Literature (Baltimore &amp; London: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1979), 42. Subsequent references to Home are cited parenthetically in the text. Regarding the writer's contemporary Concord environs, David R. Foster has recently shown how this "fully humanized" agricultural milieu functioned (3). See his Thoreau's Country: Journey Through a Transformed Landscape (Cambridge, Mass. &amp; London: Harvard Univ. Press, 1999). 65 Compare William Cronon's (post)modern rephrasing of this worry: "Ideas of nature never exist outside a cultural context, and the meanings we assign to nature cannot help reflecting that context" (35). Positing a pristine and/or ideal nature, Cronon reasons, concomitantly engenders a "central paradox: wilderness [then] embodies a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural" (80). See Uncom mon Ground: Toward Reinventing Nature, ed. W. Cronon (New York &amp; London: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995). One could also argue, of course, that culture determines nature in the modern era, and that "technology" thus gradually becomes redundant as a descriptive term by its very ubiquity. Thoreau, however, did not yield to such a notion, and his texts continually struggle on behalf of the "wild" and "natural" in the face of civilization. 66 Nicholas K. Bromell points to the "contradiction between Thoreau's desire to see writing as cultivation and his lingering inclination to see it as artifice" [By the Sweat of the Brow: Literature and Labor in Antebellum America (Chicago &amp; London: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1993), 85. Subsequent references to Brow are cited parenthetically in the text]. Initially more optimistic than Sundquist, Bromell argues that "Thoreau's myth of American origins allows him to place human work, including his own work as a writer, within the fold of nature. To work, according to such a vision, is to express the earth, not subdue or 'master' it" (93). Further, as Bromell speculates, "Thoreau verges upon a recognition that the destiny of writing patterned upon natural making ... is silence" (94). My own argument is somewhat different: that Thoreau remained uneasy and undecided over both the relationship between civilization and nature and that between language and experience. His late journal is not silent, but perhaps—as seen in light of earlier writings—more wary of rhetorical flourishes and symbolizing of natural phenomena. The latter would be the "wounds" to Nature which Sundquist argues Thoreau's writing inflicts. Indeed Bromell, as if in realization of such critique, chooses finally to reverse his reconciliatory tone and instead argue for an aesthetic debate. "Walden," he now writes, "is the enactment of a dialectic precisely between artifice and generation, between the work of the (transcendent) father who stands outside his artifact and the creation of the (immanent) mother who resides within hers" (216). 67 Compare Richard Dillman's gloss on this chapter, and also his description of Thoreau's general attitude toward his (oral and textual) audience as one of contractual obligation CRhetoric, 81-94). 68 A more insidious distraction, of course, was Thoreau's concern over his own literary success. Steven Fink has convincingly shown how his commitment to '"absolute truth"' was tested, however hard this was to admit, by "underlying public ambitions and ... implicit hope that his words [would] not fall on deaf ears"—thus rendering his intermittently "violent hostility toward trade [in its various aspects] quite inconsistent with the larger context" (256; 262). As Fink argues, this latent tension eventually took</page><page sequence="53">106 The Concord Saunterer aesthetic effect, in that Thoreau strove to layer his texts to interest both the "deliber ate" and "superficial" reader; a strategy culminating in "Wild Apples" (Prophet in the Marketplace: Thoreau's Development as a Professional Writer ( Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1992), 275-85. In Walden, however, it seems clear that Thoreau calls for an audience of the former type, and poises his writing for the challenge. In Walden: Volatile Truths (New York: Twayne, 1992), Martin Bickman argues that "[f]or Thoreau [in Walden]... reading is not a Lockean process of passively absorbing what is already created ... but rather a more transcendentalist one of reciprocity, of mind actively shaping, partaking in creations" (35). 69 To somewhat foreshadow my argumentation, it is significant to note that Thoreau eventually reevaluated his mother-to-father hierarchy of language to a diametrically opposite position. In his journal of January 2, 1859, he complains of "the hypercritical quarreling about grammar and style" among contemporary grammarians: "they forget that the first requisite and rule is that expression shall be vital and natural, as much as the voice of a brute or an interjection; first of all, mother tongue; and last of all, artificial or father tongue" (Journal # 11), 386. 70 Stanley Cavell, The Senses of Walden: An Expanded Edition (Chicago &amp; London: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1992), 34. On Thoreau's calling, see the chapter "Words" (3 35). Subsequent references to Senses are cited parenthetically in the text. 71 One could say that Thoreau positions his persona as a son in the proposed language hierarchy of mother/nature and father/God. Whether we then accept him as a redeem ing son, or as one latently plagued by oedipal feelings, is an open question. 72 I cite "moratorium" here as defined by Richard Lebeaux in his Young Man Thoreau (Amherst: Univ. of Massachusetts Press, 1977), 64. The term is later employed to characterize an important aspect of Thoreau's desire at Walden in Lebeaux's Thoreau's Seasons (Amherst: Univ. of Massachusetts Press, 1984), 35. Subsequent references to Thoreau's Seasons are cited parenthetically in the text. 73 Thoreau's frequent albeit inconsistent use of the feminine pronoun for nature is of course interesting. Jane Bennett opines that "[t]he Thoreauian [sic] stylistics seem to cry out for a gendered reading," adding that Thoreau can "be read as the man who exposes himself to woman/nature—to [a] nature ... to be mastered or, alternatively, to be loved in her subordinate place" (Thoreau's Nature, xxiii-xxiv). A crucial aspect Bennett neglects to mention is that Thoreau also elevates nature to an abstract, feminine ideal and/or superior force (viz the maternal nature in "A Winter Walk" and the familiar Maine Woods epiphanies referring to a harsh "stepmother" nature, for example). Thoreau only by turns portrays himself as above his feminine "Nature"; in other cases he is her sworn servant or subject. Arguably, a deeper problem is framed by the fact that the feminine, as variably understood by Thoreau, is never addressed on equal footing: it will find itself either humbly debased or severely idealized, but never on level ground with its male writer. 74 Compare Robert Pogue Harrison's assertion in his chapter "The Woods of Walden" in Forests: The Shadow of Civilization (Chicago &amp; London: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1992): "Thoreau presumes to discover his irreducible relation to nature. What he discovers is that this relation remains opaque. We are in relation to nature because we are not within nature" (222). 75 It is interesting to note that Thoreau is keen to inform the Walden reader that his cabin had no blinds or curtains—"I have no gazers to shut out but the sun and moon, and I</page><page sequence="54">Henrik Gustafsson 107 am willing that they should look in" (W, 67). He wishes that his dwelling at Walden give as unencumbered access as possible to nature (cf. n. 81 below). 76 Nicholas K. Bromell has argued that "Thoreau tries to evade the ineluctably represen tative nature of language and literature by presenting his creation as speech, not text, by eliding the speech action of Walden with the 'language which all things and events speak"' (Brow, 234). While irony certainly abounds in Thoreau, Bromell's interpreta tion would render his written text in "Sounds" a supreme paradox. To my mind, there is more than jest in this chapter. 77 I.e., with Leo Marx's phrasing, he hopes to make 'the word one with the thing CMachine, 249). 78 Compare the Thoreau prepared to "publish [life's] meanness to the world" (W, 91). "Publish" connotes both "issuing of text" and "making generally known." 79 Indeed, the Kouroo passage may be read for wider implications. Henry Golemba has argued for reading the artist's stick as a pen, while the significant intrusion of a countervoice in the passage—"But why do I stay to mention these things?" ( W, 327)— would distance "the voice of the real author working his pen from his idealized model" (Wild Rhetoric, 211). The essential crisis of the passage, to my mind, is history."[I]nto a perfect work time does not enter": this is the requirement for one who—like Thoreau writing Walden—would strive to create "a world with full and fair proportions" (W, 326-27). Yet the result presents us with, in William Howarth's phrase, "a life caught in amber" more than anything else [The Book of Concord: Thoreau's Life as a Writer (New York: The Viking Press, 1982), 92]. Thoreau does not have the Kouroo artist's time, and his creation, while ever striving for myth, cannot avoid the historical aspects of civilization and language. 80 The source of this quote is Transtômer's poem "Fem strofer till Thoreau." A transla tion and analysis is given in my and Niklas Schioler's "True Fugitives: On Tomas Transtromer and Thoreau" in the Thoreau Society Bulletin no. 225 (1998): 1-4. 81 Frederick Garber has called attention to Walden's early, cautionary comments on housing, and argues from these that "[w]e are less at home in the world to the degree that we build a house. Insofar as we shelter ourselves (and we inevitably must do so), we cut into that continuity with the surrounding air that is the most desirable state, cut into our best, fullest at-homeness. Home making and house making seem to be contradictory acts. Dwelling in the largest sense of being at home in the world cannot be fully compatible with the building of a dwelling" (Fable, 149). 82 Here I contrast mildly with Lawrence Buell, who proposes that "Thoreau's coloniza tion of his surroundings by his household effects gives way ... to the feeling of being constituted—lock, stock, and barrel—by the forms of nature. Ecocentrism replaces egocentrism" (Environmental Imagination, 154-55). 83 One could of course further the analogy, and see the stick as a phallus—as intimately linked to Thoreau's desire for potency and productivity—only sublimated to an aesthetic plane. 84 With regard to the economy of nature in Thoreau's writings, Richard Grusin has convincingly argued that it is one of both affluence and abundant sacrifice: "It is not production and acquisition but destruction and loss that keep this natural economy in motion," he concludes (45). See Grusin's "Thoreau, Extravagance, and the Economy of Nature," in American Literary History 5 (1993), 30-50. For the "innocence" Thoreau nevertheless saw in this process (but not without wavering), see Mcintosh's</page><page sequence="55">108 The Concord Savnterer Romantic Naturalist, 245-47. Charles R. Metzger, in turn, has argued that Thoreau developed different opinions of nature's economy over time. See Metzger's Thoreau and Whitman: A Study of Their Esthetics (Seattle: Univ. of Washington Press, J 961 ), 23-24. 85 Laura Dassow Walls verges on this problematic when she notes that "Thoreau understood both the power of the engine, and its fragility. The power as it extended along the tracks was invincible: it never turns aside. But it never turns aside; step ten feet from the tracks, and it cannot follow" (162). Soon after this observation. Walls comments that "[w]riting is also a form of technology, another way for man and nature to bespeak one another. Thoreau's writing put Walden on the map—literally; he packaged it up into a neat whole ... and sent it whirling away to the world" (162). See Walls's Seeing New Worlds: Henry David Thoreau and Nineteenth-Century Natural Science (Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1995). What is noted is thus the commodity aspect of Thoreau's finished work—which is indeed interesting to probe. But the larger question of Thoreau's writing per se remains: can it turn aside, if it also be a technology? 86 Thoreau's slight shifting of the issue of "tracks" is indicative of a larger dialectic at work in Walden. Here the railroad is implicitly a proper track if it should stem from the free choice or whim of the traveler. Interestingly, being "trackless" in the face of wild Nature is also rendered negative in the passage. 87 I am indebted to Robert Milder for this observation. See his Reimagining Thoreau, 101. 88 Friedrich A. Kittler's work would perhaps seem relevant to this aspect of Thoreau's writing, but I take issue with his proposal in relation to the dissemination of the typewriter: "writing was [then] no longer [a] handwritten, continuous transition from nature to culture" (194). This, to my mind, blurs the fact that writing with a pen was (and still is) a technological process in its own right. See Kittler's Discourse Networks 1800/1900, transi. M. Meteer and C. Cullens (1985; Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press, 1990). 89 Robert Sattelmeyer has eloquently argued for a predominant rationale behind this and similar Thoreauvian exhortations: "His aims . . . were not to discover in nature evidence of his own or mankind's special place in the universe but rather to under stand his own life in all its phases according to the anterior life of nature" (53). See Sattelmeyer's "The Coleridgean Influence on Thoreau' s Science," in Thoreau 's World and Ours: A Natural Legacy, ed. E. A. Schofield &amp; R. C. Baron (Golden, Col.: North American Press, 1993), 48-54. 90 Admittedly, Thoreau had toyed with an alternate phrasing of the problem in his journal—by simply reversing the argument. Thus, an August 7, 1853, entry asks: "Is it not as language that all natural objects affect the poet? He sees a flower or other object, and it is beautiful or affecting to him because it is a symbol of his thought, and what he indistinctly feels or perceives is matured in some other organization. The objects I behold correspond to my mood" (Journal # 5, 359). With this and similar quotes in mind, Scott Slovic has argued that Thoreau's "language of nature is not merely something to receive and interpret (as it was for the Puritans), but rather a medium for his own communication" [Seeking Awareness in American Nature Writing (Salt Lake City: Univ. of Utah Press, 1992), 30. Subsequent references to Awareness are cited parenthetically in the text]. Thus, Thoreau would make nature correspond to himself,</page><page sequence="56">Hennk Gustafsson 109 and we would perhaps feel urged to rephrase our question of Thoreau's quest for nature into one of how he expresses his self. Yet the difference is largely rhetorical. In each case Thoreau's natural environment becomes his focus of attention as a chosen source of reference. Also, while having noted the above discrepancy, Slovic wisely concludes that the correspondence between "the inner self and outer world, between mind and nature ... is a question that Thoreau never answers finally—and thus results the rich tension of identity forging" (Awareness, 6). 91 Read in the present tense, "novel" connotes "new" and "exciting"; in the past tense, however, it points to a retroactive assimilation—with Walden's narrator writing a novel of his life. Henry Golemba takes this pun to underscore that " Walden is but one dramatized version of his many possible selves" at the pond ( Wild Rhetoric, 194). 92 See, on this point, Lawrence Buell's excellent discussion in Literary Transcendental ism: Style and Vision in the American Renaissance (Ithaca &amp; London: Cornell Univ. Press, 1973), 148; 166-67 and the chapter "Thoreau and the Literary Excursion," 188 207. Also, Richard Dillman argues that Thoreau's chosen literary form in Walden owes to the tenets of psychological rhetoric as introduced by Thoreau's Harvard teacher Edward Tyrell Channing. As Dillman shows, psychological rhetoric "coin cided with the development of the Romantic movement. Some of its characteristics— flexible approaches to form, the absence of rigidly prescribed rules, the rejection of artificial ornament, and an emphasis on clear language grounded as much as possible on sensory phenomena—parallel the Romantic reaction against artistic rigidity and prescribed form" (Rhetoric, 29-30). 93 Compare Thoreau's remarks in "Spring": "The first sparrow of spring! The year beginning with younger hope than ever! ... What at such time are histories, chronolo gies, traditions, and all written revelations?" (W, 310). 94 Indeed, not all critics appreciate the ambiguity of Thoreau's Walden. In his Nature, Technology, and Society: Cultural Roots of the Current Environmental Crisis (New York &amp; London: New York Univ. Press, 1993), Victor Ferkiss—while ignoring the recycled nature of most of the material—argues that "[Thoreau's] cabin at Walden Pond was made largely of the artifacts of a machine civilization" (76). This view, along with a rather reductionist thesis that Thoreau was no lover of wilderness, prompts Ferkiss to conclude that Thoreau "was not a lover of nature per se, but a pastoralist in a traditional American sense. For modern-day Americans, he has little to contribute in solving . . . technological and ecological problems" (76). 95 Lawrence Buell has—albeit in a different context—aptly summarized Thoreau's position: "in Walden" he writes, "irony is always and inevitably present, if only because of the gap between the experiment and the literary record of it" (331). And Thoreau's speaker, in turn, "wavers between trust in the ability of [his] experiment to bring about the personal and social transformations he desires and an ironic awareness that he may not be acting for anyone's benefit—not even his own" (332). See Buell's New England Literary Culture: From Revolution Through Renaissance (Cambridge, Mass.: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986). 96 William Drake has voiced a similar worry: "We generally take Thoreau at his own word; but I suspect that the conclusion of Walden is forced—that it is an expression of hope, a need, and not a true report of his own experience, even though he would have us think so." See Drake's "Spiritual Ideals and Scientific Fact: Thoreau's Search for Reality," in The Western Thoreau Centenary: Selected Papers, ed. J. Golden Taylor</page><page sequence="57">110 The Concord Saunterer (Logan: Utah State Univ. Press, 1963), 54-62 (59). For comparison from a psychologi cal vantage, see Raymond D. Gozzi's "Some Aspects of Thoreau's Personality" (Ph.D. chapter, 1957), rpt. in Henry David Thoreau: A Profile, ed. Walter Harding (New York: Hill and Wang, 1971), 150-71, which argues that Thoreau's Deep Cut passages suggest troubling unconscious drives "channeled into poetic self-expres sion" (168). Richard Lebeaux has later qualified Gozzi's findings, yet also sees the thawing sandbank as a token of struggle: "Out of the Deep Cut, out of the wounds [Thoreau] had suffered and endured, was emerging, however haltingly, his 'creative moment'" (Thoreau's Seasons, 150). 97 As a speculative parallel, Michael West has proposed that Thoreau's sandbank pas sage owes to Walter Whiter's etymological theories. Whiter reasoned that the origin of language was generated by the earth itself, and in this context discussed what he saw as both transmogrifying and redemptive aspects of mud. Whiter's link to Thoreau is tenuous, however, as West himself concedes: a copy of the book rested on Emerson's shelves, without any further evidence that Thoreau consulted it. See West's "Walden's Dirty Language: Thoreau and Walter Whiter's Geocentric Etymological Theories," Harvard Library Bulletin 22 (1974:2): 117-28. 98 I am in part indebted to Richard Bridgman for this observation: "From the [Deep Cut] images ... one feels that something violent had been done to nature, as in fact it had, by the crews who first cleared the [area] to accommodate the Fitchburg tracks." Quoted from Bridgman's Dark Thoreau (Lincoln &amp; London: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1982), 145. 99 I am here obligated to Joan Burbick's gloss: "The correspondences that develop between the sand and leaves, vines, and thalluses are not between a natural object and a mental analogy; for Thoreau the correspondence is in matter. The sand itself resembles vegetation so that the analogies exist in the horizontal world of the mate rial" (Alternate History, 75). 100 For a differing opinion of this passage, arguing that the railroad sandbank "suggests how industrialism may yet transcend itself," see Michael D. West's "Reclaiming Thoreau's Humor for the Classroom" in Approaches to Teaching Thoreau's Walden and Other Works, ed. Richard J. Schneider (New York: MLA, 1996), 96. Also, Gordon E. Bigelow has assessed the tropology of the Deep Cut as typically organic: "In a way common to other symbolists, Thoreau sees the world as an esthetic creation whose innermost secret is growth and ongoing process," he maintains (9). Yet irony, to my mind, springs from the question of whose "esthetic creation" is relevant to the passage. See Bigelow's "Thoreau's Melting Sandbank: Birth of a Symbol," Interna tional Journal of Symbology 2 (1971): 7-13. 101 H. Daniel Peck, "The Crosscurrents of Walden's Pastoral," in New Essays on Walden, ed. Robert F. Sayre (New York: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1992), 80. Subsequent references to "Crosscurrents" are cited parenthetically in the text. 102 Thoreau would again make rhetorical use of the railroad's perceived force in a later journal entry of August 30, 1856: "What is that pretended life that does not take up a claim, that does not occupy ground, that cannot build a causeway to its objects?" The Journal of Henry David Thoreau, Volume 9: August 1856-August 1857, ed. B. Torrey and F. H. Allen (rpt. Salt Lake City: Peregrine Smith, 1984), 38. Subsequent refer ences to Journal #9 are cited parenthetically in the text. 103 Charles R. Anderson, in his The Magic Circle ofWalden (New York, Chicago &amp; San</page><page sequence="58">Henrik Gustafsson Ill Francisco: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston, 1968), proposes that we"[should] avoid being taken in by the pretended subjects (like the argument against railroads) and so discover the true poetic subjects" (17). I would—with the above discussion in mind—suggest that both subjects, technology and aesthetics, are intimately linked in the book. 104 See Thoreau's Minnesota Journey: Two Documents, ed. Walter Harding (Geneseo, N.Y.:Thoreau Society (Booklet No. 16], 1962), 29-30. 105 See my "Advent," 69, n. 40. 106 William Ellery Channing, Thoreau: The Poet-Naturalist (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1873), 322. 107 Raymond P. Tripp, Jr., professes to be the most loyal current interpreter with his Two Fish on One Hook: A Transformative Reading of Thoreau's Walden (Hudson, N.Y.: Lindisfarne Books, 1998). Repeatedly denigrating what he sees as "the dark tarn of academic criticism" of the book, he proposes that it presents an overlooked yet fully correspondent allegory of existence (70; 19). Having argued at length for a prophetic Thoreau, Tripp concludes that "[in] Walden Nature is 'not afraid to exhibit herself,' and to be 'carried off,' but only by those who are 'in a peculiar sense a part of Nature themselves'" (160). Yet in the relevant passage, Thoreau actually differentiates be tween "[f]ishermen, hunters, woodchoppers, and others" as privileged vis-à-vis nature over "philosophers and poets even, who approach her with expectation" (W, 210). And Thoreau's position as writer arguably operates within just such vocational (or role taking) tensions. His is a protean, rather than single, guise: in Walden he takes on all the above identities, albeit at disparate junctions. For a similar reason, deriding contradictory "readings" of Walden in Tripp's fashion strikes as unduly dogmatic (14). Could not the reader—indeed the same reader—have legitimate motives for approaching the book differently at different occasions? 108 See Faith in a Seed, ed. Bradley P. Dean (Washington, D.C. &amp; Covelo, Cal.: Island Press, 1993), and Wild Fruits, ed. Bradley P. Dean (New York &amp; London: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2000), "Introduction," xii. Also, book-length studies by Bennett, Buell. Cameron, Hildebidle, Mcintosh, Paul and Walls—all previously mentioned—give partly conflicting yet conclusive evidence of Thoreau's flexible and probing episte mology of nature (cf. Buell's estimation in his Environmental Imagination, 364). See also Michael Berger's excellent discussion of "Henry David Thoreau's Science in The Dispersion of Seeds," Annals of Science 53 (1996): 381-97; and further his "The Saunterer's Vision: Henry Thoreau's Epiphany of Forest Dynamics in The Dispersion of Seeds," Concord Saunterer N.S. 4 (1996): 43-75, which expounds the pragmatic of Thoreau's stylistics in this late work as sprung from a perceived role of "cultural mediator" between nature and man (62-63). Ronald Wesley Hoag has shown impor tant indices of remaining Transcendentalism in Thoreau's later works, despite their increasingly empirical concerns. An "essential kinship" between the human and natural seems thus to have remained Thoreau's conviction, although he played it out differently in his various texts (163). See Hoag's "Thoreau's Later Natural History Writings" in The Cambridge Companion to Henry David Thoreau, ed. Joel Myerson (Cambridge, Mass.: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996), 152-70. Further, for a deft cata loguing of Thoreau's complex motivations for approaching nature in Walden and beyond, see Lawrence Buell's "Thoreau and the Natural Environment" in the same volume, 171-93. Finally, Robert Kuhn McGregor has recently opined that "Thoreau was [successively] inventing what we now call the principle of biocentrism and the</page><page sequence="59">112 The Concord Saunterer science of ecology" (3), while he is gradually to have "embraced the idea that humanity was an integral part of the natural whole" (181). McGregor's analysis is probably the closest yet approximating an outright ecological understanding of nature in the later Thoreau.
