<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religious Trends in Early Islamic Iran. By WILFERD MADELUNG. Bibliotheca Persica, Columbia Lectures on Iranian Studies, no. 4. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1988. Pp. 128. $32.50 (cloth), $9.95 (paperback). Islam has never been monolithic in Iran. This is clearly shown in this volume which publishes Madelung's Columbia Lectures on Iranian Studies, delivered in December 1983 and which amounts to a synthesis and distilla- tion of his more detailed research. Here he is concerned with the motivation of religious movements in terms of ideology, with their geo- graphical distribution, with temporal changes in the types of movements, and with diversity within movements. The existence of a mosaic of sectarian forms of Islam in Iran up to the Safavi period is im- plicit in the organization of this work into sep- arate chapters on different religious trends. It begins with a chapter on (non-Islamic) Maz- dakism and the Khurrimiyya which contains a comparison with the Kanthaeans to suggest the possibility of syncretism and "foreign" influ- ences among the Mazdakites, and a twelfth- century Ismacili polemic against contemporary Mazdakites that makes a point of their different views of the imamate. However, Madelung's</page><page sequence="2">APRIL 1992 BOOK REVIEWS 159 assertion of asceticism among Mazdakites is questionable. A chapter on the MurjiDa and Sunni Traditionalism points out the connection between Murji'i doctrine and the Hanafiyya in eastern Iran. The egalitarian relevance of Hanafi irjda for conversion to Islam is plau- sible, but in tracing this to the movement of al- Harith ibn Surayj the issue of whether or not al-Harith was a Qadari is not addressed here. However, the lack of doctrinal uniformity among early hadith-oriented Muslims is a valid point, and in contrasting Hanafi MurjiDis with the early Ijanabila he argues that the origin of the latter among Arab Khurasanis who settled in Baghdad contributed to their support of the caliphate as an institution because they were former frontier loyalists, to their attempt to create a common religious and legal doctrine based on hadith because they were not already committed to some regional system and to their opinion that early Muslims were higher in sta- tus than later converts because they were mostly Arab. It could be added that the last fits well with their hadith orientation. The main thesis of the chapter "The Two Factions of Sunnism: Hanafism and Shaficism" is that the factional balance between them was disrupted by Saljiiq patronage which provoked conflict. The defeat of the Shicis did not bring Sunni solidarity. It would have been helpful, how- ever, if he had described the differences in rit- ual between Hanafis and Shaficis. In the chapter on Siffism and the Karramiyya, he goes beyond the anthropomorphism of the latter and notes their tendency to be IHanafi in law, MurjiDi in doctrine, to use reason to recognize good and evil although they opposed Muctazil- ism and kaldm, and for tawakkul to lead to as- ceticism, an antiworldly aversion to work, and concentration on worship in their khanaqaihs. In contrast, he argues that, at least from the tenth century, S.ifis in Iran tended to be Shafici in law and Ashcari in doctrine. It might be added that the former was related to a growing hadith orientation among S$ifis. He also sug- gests that Si.fis helped to spread Shafici law in Iran at the expense of the Hanafis, and gives an account of early S$ifi groups, especially the Kazarfiniyya. In the chapter on the CAjarida and the Ibajdiyya, he argues that the motivation of such Khariji groups was based on Islamic piety rather than on Arab feelings. He gives a useful critique of the views of Montgomery Watt and others about the bedouin orientation of the Khawarij and an equally useful survey of Khar- iji groups and doctrines in Iran. It is well to re- member that they were part of the Islamic presence there. The chapter "Shicism: The Imamiyya and the Zaydiyya" highlights the importance of Qom as an early hadith-oriented Imami center in Iran and gives a summary of Zaydi activity. The final chapter "Ismacilism: The Old and the New Dacwa" summarizes the contribution of Iranians to the development of Ismacili doctrine and closes with a representa- tion of the Nizaris as the "true successors" of Mazdakis and the Khurramiyya, not in terms of doctrine, but as a radical, subversive threat to the order of the state. The effect of this collection is to emphasize the wide diversity among Muslims in pre- Safavi Iran and to suggest some of the ideolog- ical justifications for their differences. Unfortu- nately, the discussion is sometimes entangled in "orientalist" terminology such as "orthodoxy" and "heresy." The use of "tradition" for hadith is particularly confusing because it leads to the assumption (in English) that "traditionalism" is conservative. His reference to conservative and traditionalist Islam in the Umawi period is puz- zling, since it is difficult to see how any form of Islam could have been "conservative" that early. His reference to traditionists in eastern Iran in the early CAbbasi period must be to transmitters of hadith, but he says this form of Islam was conservative without saying why. Nevertheless, Madelung generally engages in a careful comparative analysis without as- serting genetic relationships. In particular, he argues against the influence of Iranian tradi- tions on Islamic movements in Iran. This col- lection thus provides a useful summary of his scholarship and a synthesis of his views.
