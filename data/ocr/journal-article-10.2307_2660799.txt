C45.00 Anthropology is meant to be a comparative discipline, but it is striking how seldom it refers to one of the best established among parallel disciplines, namely comparative philology. How many British textbooks on social/cultural anthropology introduce stu- dents to the concept of language families and to the varied uses of that framework? Twenty years after Levi-Strauss welcomed Dumezil into the Academie Francaise, many an under- graduate writes an examination essay on myth in total ignorance of the latter's work on Indo-European comparative mythology. Watkins cultivates a domain intermediate between mainstream philologists' preoccupa- tions with phonology, grammar and lexis, and Dumezilian comparativism with its focus on institutions, pantheons and narratives. Prob- ably he is closer to the former, for instance to E. Benveniste's Vocabulary of Indo-European institutions (London 1973), but his prime concern is with the phraseology used by poets. Reconstructions of the ancestral proto- IE poetic locutions ('starred forms') are occa- sionally given, but they are secondary to the aim of recognizing the cognate forms in sur- viving texts. The undertaking is by no means new. Already in 1853 Kuhn linked Homer's kleos aphthiton with Rigvedic sravas aksitam - both mean 'imperishable fame' and derive from the proto-form *kleuos ndg"hitom; major contributors to the field in recent years have included Rudiger Schmitt, Enrico 159</page><page sequence="2">160 BOOK REVIEWS Campanile and Fran,oise Bader. But since Watkins writes in English, and very readably (exotic material is regularly translated), he will surely dominate Anglophone perceptions of the field. One way to read the book is as a poetic experience in its own right, a meta-poetry, stretching the mind and enlarg- ing the imagination. There is a pleasur- able intoxication in leaping to and fro between Homer, Beowulf, the Rig Veda, Hittite ritual texts, ilnvocations in the obscure Italic relatives of Latin, Old Irish poetry, early Zoroastrianism, and more. One encoun- ters a whole new vocabulary of words like polyptoton, priamel and merism, and is sensitized to unexpected stylemes, phonetic effects and aspects of metrics. One revels in the author's range of knowledge and comparativist acuity, and marvels at the sophistication of the non-literate poets who elaborated it all. (As for the when and the where, Watkins does not discuss linguistic palaeontology or archaeology, and for current answers to such questions one must look elsewhere.) There is plenty to respond to more prosaically, for the ancient poetic formulae often encode concepts that are socially significant. For instance, for the economic or legal anthropologist there is the division of property into goods and chattels, non- moveable and moveable respectively; for the political anthropologist, the long history of hunger strikes; for the medical anthropol- ogist, the classification of body tissues. The standard sequence runs from inside outwards, from marrow via flesh and skin to hair - a finding due to Stephanie Jamison, Watkins's wife, to whom the book is dedicated. Note too the discussion of the triadic classification of medical treatments - by drugs, surgery and mantras (i.e. verbal magic) - an oft-noted manifestation of Dumezil's 'three functions'. The mytheme alluded to in the title may be quasi-universal, but in the Indo-European world it is expressed by a 'basic formula' subject to numerous elaborations and sub- stitutions. The dragon or serpent may be replaced by an anthropomorphic antagonist, the direction of killing may be reversed, a companion or weapon may be specified, etc. This leads Watkins to recognize a rich net- work of more or less cognate expressions that are extraordinarily pervasive across the spatio- temporal range that he examines. Though Dumezil is barely mentioned, the pervasive- ness of a proto-IE heritage in poetry will en- courage Dum6zilians in their search for other forms of ideological heritage which may not be recognizable via the lexicon. This is a magnificent work. N. J. ALLEN University of Oxford</page></plain_text>
