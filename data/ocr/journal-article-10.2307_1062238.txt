Hosoi THE SACRED TREE IN JAPANESE PREHISTORY Experts in Japanese religion, history, and culture can hardly disagree with the following remark made by Holtman in 1931: "It is difficult to imagine how any field could be richer in the materials for study of the sacred tree than in Japan ...." Yet they will discover very quickly that this area of study in Japanese religion has been neglected by Western scholars.2 Statistically, more than 80 percent of Japan's total land space is taken by unarable mountains and hills covered with verdure; these pro -ide the laurel forest zone of evergreen which extends its horizon from the southeastern part to the region of northern low- lands and the forest zone of deciduous trees in the high altitude of the northern region of the mainland. Nature blesses the land with trees and flowers which flourish in season and out of season. It is quite natural that this environment should foster the develop- ment of myths, legends, lores, and cults revolving around vegeta- tion. The fact speaks for itself. It may sound hyperbolic if anyone says that the indigenous religion of Japan, whether Shinto or folk religion, will cease its function without things which nature richly furnishes, especially trees and their surrogates. The fact of the matter is that this statement does not exaggerate the case. 1 Daniel Holtman, "Some Notes on Japanese Tree Worship," Transactions of Asiatic Society of Japan, ser. 2, 8 (1931): 2. 2 For a recent work containing the theme of the sacred tree, see Nelly Naumann, "Yama no kami-die Japanische Berggottheit," Asian Folklore Studies 22 (1963): 133-366. 95</page><page sequence="2">Sacred Tree in Japan Materials for study of the sacred tree related to religious cults, oral tradition, and written documents of the historical period are indeed abundant. This paper, however, limits its scope of investigation to the prehistoric phase, excluding the Paleolithic period. The omission of this period is deliberate and inevitable and requires some explanation. Since the discovery of stone implements in 1949 at Iwajuku in Gumma prefecture, more than 100 sites which bear the mark of genuine Paleolithic culture have been unearthed. Chronologically, the bearer of this culture was contemporary with those who created marvelous and mystery-ridden cave galleries in Europe. Those prehistoric paintings, hand impressions, incisions, etc. are loaded with symbolic and magic formulae, yet they eloquently bear witness to one important fact: the presence of man's ability to express himself. Maringer, following the opinion of George Kraft, contends that "the most ancient tools of man are genuine, valid fruits of his creative spirit."3 Schenk characterizes the mental ability of European Paleolithic man as "dynamic and powerful, filled with spirit and imagination." 4 Leroi-Gourhan's view on cave paintings, "Everything seems arranged according to a dualistic system," points to the birth of homo rationale.5 Whatever reason there may have been, however, Paleolithic man in Japan made no attempt to express himself in concrete forms.6 There exists no single archaeological find which may provide a clue to unlock the secret of his religious world. In the Paleolithic period in Japan, conifers and cryptomerias were said to be growing in the region of modern Tokyo. Familiar with "peculiar sounds and silence, loneliness, dim religious light, long shadows and enchantments" which primeval forests generate, we can hardly imagine that ancient man did not respond- psychologically, emotionally, or religiously-to a mysterious atmosphere inherent in dense forest.7 Japanese Paleolithic man most likely succumbed to the mystery of nature with the same 3 Johannes Maringer, The Gods of Prehistoric Man (New York: Alfred A.

James conjectures that the cult of the sacred tree emerged when the ice retracted and the warmer climate returned to the earth, and thereafter the cult began to flourish, especially from the Neolithic period onward.8 In view of historical circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that interest in vegetation greatly increased with the commencement of agriculture; and, in proportion to this increase, the plant began to hold an important place in the arena of religious symbolism. RELIGION IN THE JOMON PERIOD The Jomon period in Japanese prehistory covers a long span of time.9 The production of pottery separated this new type of culture from the preceding stone industries without earthenwares. As Childe notes, making pottery was man's earliest conscious effort to improve his living conditions; and, at the same time, it was related to the discovery of a rudimentary principle that clay changes chemically when exposed to heat. The mind that recognized this process of transformation was the same mind that improved stone implements, invented bows and arrows, and initiated the agricultural revolution. In this aspect of human activities, there exists no qualitative difference between pre- historic man and contemporary man; it is a degree of sophistica- tion that separates one from the other, and, for that reason, terms such as "prelogical mentality" or Urdummheit will distort our understanding of the true ability of prehistoric man. Certainly, the conversion of mud or dust into stone could be a "sort of magic transsubstantiation" in the eyes of the discoverer.10 How- ever, the recognition of magic power and mystery in the process of transformation is not irrational; it belongs to the world of 8 Ibid., p. 2. 9 The inaugural date of Jomon culture remains uncertain. On the basis of the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, Groot sets the date around 3000 B.c. (Gerard J. Groot, The Prehistory of Japan [New York: Columbia University Press, 1951]). On the other hand, radiocarbon examination puts it as far back as 7000 B.C. The reader finds two chronological tables in J. Edward Kidder's books. On the basis of C14, Kidder sets the Earliest Jomon period around 7000 B.c. in The Birth of Japanese Art (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1965), pp. 6 f.; but the same period is dated between 4500 and 3700 B.C. in Japan before Buddhism (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1959), p. 35. Korean archaeologists set the date of the Neolithic period in Korea around 3000 B.C. (Han Pyong-Sam, "Neolithic Culture of Korea," Korean Journal 14, no. 4 [April 1974]: 12). 10 Gordon Childe, Man Makes Himself (New York: New American Library, 1959), pp. 76-77. 97</page><page sequence="4">Sacred Tree in Japan religion in which the mystery of reality is confirmed and expressed by means of symbols. Thus prehistoric arts encompass both consciously executed aesthetic expressions and intentions to represent the unknown that sustains life."1 The outburst of creative energy which we recognize in the Katsusaka type of pottery in Japan (the Middle Jomon period) eloquently exemplifies the fact that the creator of this new style possessed an extra- ordinary ability to convert ideas into tangible forms. "Palaeolithic man was cult-ridden," wrote Schenk, and so was Jomon man. A number of religious symbols such as clay figurines, clay plaques, clay masks, stone hats, stone phalli, stone circles, shell mounds, to mention them at random, compose the major outlook of Jomon religion as far as archaeological finds are con- cerned. Groot believes that the shell mound had some religious significance. "The custom of burying the dead in the shell mounds was widespread among Mesolithic peoples of the world," he contends.12 It is well known that shells have been highly esteemed by many cultures since ancient times, and their symbolic meanings have been recognized in the context of both cultural values and religious values.13 As for clay figurines, Maringer pays special attention to one type in which demonic, grotesque, and sexless features are emphasized. Referring to one of the figurines dis- covered in Yamanashi prefecture, he makes this remark: "On the whole, this bizarre subhuman and demoniac figure seems to represent a spirit, a supernatural being, which is beyond the horizon of human experience; it is for this reason that the effect is so grotesque."14 A clay figure from Satohara in Gumma prefecture (the Late Jomon period) is assumed to be anthropomorphic, in view of its general appearance. The arched legs, massive and thicker than its abdominal part, support the entire structure of one foot in height. The sex is indicated by small, pointed breasts. 11 The term jomon, e.g., means "rope impression." However, the technique used for this design varies; in the Early Jomon period, the cords were twisted. The vertical, horizontal, and diagonal applications of string, coupled with their combinations, create different effects. The use of jomon could be purely aesthetic, but the snake motif, the circle motif, the eau courante motif, etc., convey other than purely aesthetic meaning. For the variation of jomon, see Kidder, Japan before Buddhism, pp. 62-64. 12 Groot, p. 51. However, his view is not widely accepted. The fact that not all the shell mounds in Japan are associated with burials makes Japanese academi- cians reluctant to admit their religious significance. 13 Mircea Eliade, Images and Symbols (New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1952), pp. 125-50. 14 Johannes Maringer, "Clay Figurines of the Jomon Period: A Contribution to the History of Ancient Religion in Japan," History of Religions 14, no. 2 (1974): 130. 98</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions The most unusual feature of this figure is its head with a large, heart-shaped face; two round eyeholes stare fixedly at something, and an extra-large nose occupies the center space between them. The mouth and ears are absent.15 This masterpiece of Jomon art seems to be a peculiar mixture of an anthropomorphic representa- tion and a conception of deity in strange, bizarre, and subhuman form. It goes without saying that the presence of phallic symbols and female figurines strongly suggests Jomon man's interest in and hope for fertility and perhaps, as Maringer believes, for good childbearing or easy childbirth.16 WOOD AND WOODWORKING Paintings and engraved images from prehistoric times find their themes in life situations. Pettazzoni points out that "the tales told by the hunters of Siberia and the Altai are nothing else than tales of animals, as indeed the myths of the Bushman, who are still more primitive hunters, are mostly stories of beasts."17 This is true of prehistoric cave paintings in Europe and elsewhere, in which animals and hunting scenes dominate. Jomon man depicted salmon on stones and fashioned bears, monkeys, dogs, boars, and tortoises of clay, and probably theriomorphic figures.18 Archaeological finds related to woodworking are very few, but this is mainly due to the natural disposition of wood. Red-painted wooden daggers, a ceremonial wooden sword lacquered in red, combs, annular bracelets, etc. were of late origin. Nonetheless, artifacts other than those mentioned above show that Jomon man made use of wood, plant fiber, bark, and vine for various purposes much earlier than the Middle Jomon period. Kidder observes that the Katsusaka people (the Middle Jomon period) improved wood- working tools for their extensive house-building program, and, in turn, the refined tools made the production of canoes and harpoons easier and put them into common use.19 The Korekawa site in Nagano prefecture reveals some interesting facts about the variety of trees which the people used: the site yielded chestnut, elm, cypress, birch, fir, oak, horse chestnut, yew, etc. and other plants such as wisteria, vine, akebi, and bamboo.20 Strangely enough, 15 For a splendid photographic reproduction of this figure, see Kidder, Birth of Japanese Art, p. 3. 16 Maringer, "Clay Figurines," p. 138. 17 Raffaele Pettazzoni, Essays on the History of Religions (Leiden: E.

Such motifs are not totally absent, to be sure, but their appearance is very marginal in comparison with abstract designs and with cultic objects like female figurines and phallic emblems. Perhaps a group of houses at Habata and Komeyama in Nagano prefecture may provide some clue that helps us understand the actual situation. They are believed to have been primitive sanc- tuaries where animals were sacrificed. For example, the Komey- ama site C yielded three earthen urns, one of which contained a number of bones bearing a mark of combustion equal to that of a whole young boar.21 Likewise, from the Habata sites 1 and 2 came scorched, broken bones of wild boar and deer. They were burnt when sacrificed. The cult of animal sacrifice suggests the existence of other types of religious cults that do not appear in Jomon objets d'art or, for that matter, in any other ways. A probability that primitive agriculture may have started in the Middle Jomon period, as some archaeologists insist, surely makes the existence of plant cults credible.22 The facts that chestnuts and walnuts were collected and stored up as an indispensable dietary item, together with fish and animal meat, and, as Kidder mentions, that wild vegetables and wild fruits were gathered in season, bring Jomon man ever closer to the plant world.23 Among Jomon wood products, canoes and pillars (used as prime materials for constructing pit dwellings) seem to be highly impor- tant. Functionally, dugout canoes were no more than primitive marine vehicles by which Jomon fishermen brought back their deep-sea catches. In view of the spiritual climate of the Jomon period, however, it is most unlikely that the construction of canoes as well as sailing for catches was only a sort of trivial manual labor.24 There exists the age-long woodcutter's custom, tobusadate, 21 Takeshi Kihara, "Jomon chiki ni mirareru shitsunai saishi no ichi shiso" [A religious rite performed in the house in the Middle Jomon period], Kodai bunka [Cultura antiqua] 21 (Spring 1969): 50. 22 Kidder, Japan before Buddhism, p. 54; Teruya Esaka, Nihon bunka no kigen [The origin of Japanese culture] (Tokyo: Kodansha, 1967), pp. 102-13. 23 Kidder, Japan before Buddhism, pp. 53-54. 24 We shall deal with the boat motif later, but one comment should be made at this point. From the Yayoi period onward, the boat became an important religious symbol, a vehicle which carried the dead to the unknown world in funeral rites and, in the world of mythology, a vehicle in which kami ride and traverse the vast expanse of space-sky and ocean. However, the break between Jomon and Yayoi cultures on the issue of boat symbolism appears to be so complete that any 100</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions the meaning of which varies from one scholar to another. Whatever its interpretations, however, one thing is certain: it is a rite related to woodcutters and performed when (or before or after) they cut trees. In the Norito of Otono-hogai ("Blessing of the great hall"), we read, ". .. The sacred axes of the Imbe are being taken to cut the trees growing in the great and the narrow gorges of the mountain recesses, leaving the stumps and branches for the wor- ship of the mountain gods to take the trunks themselves... ."25 On the occasion of Sengu (the removal of shrines) the priests of the Ise shrine perform the Konomotosai (literally, "the rite held at the root of the tree") in order to obtain a tree for the sacred pillar. In the Nara and Heian periods, tobusadate (probably erecting a branch on the freshly cut stump) was customarily practiced when trees were cut for shipbuilding.26 On the level of folk religion, many similar customs have been reported in conjunction with the work of woodcutters and with the new year festival, in which the sacred tree plays a major role.27 In this respect, the Ainu custom of inserting a winged inau in a slit in the stump when the tree is cut and the log is rolled aside is noteworthy.28 The origin of the Ainu is so obscure that a great deal of speculation and controversy has been generated among academicians. A theory that the Jomon people were the Ainu has been held by western Japanologists since the mid-nineteenth century, and "the Pan-Ainu theory" of Matsumoto, formulated in 1919, provided it with anthropometric data.29 Rebuttals and modifications, including a view biased by nationalistic sentiment, followed thereafter. Anthropometrically, "Jomon man was only thinly blended with Mongoloid features." 30 On the other hand, "blood-type index," "fingerprint index," and other elements such as the shape of eyes (non-Mongoloid), attempt to bridge these two cultures will misrepresent the actual case. As far as stone and clay artifacts are concerned, Jomon culture did not show a sign of interest in boat shapes. 25 Felica Bock, trans., Engishiki: Procedures of the Engi Era (Tokyo: Sophia University, 1972), 2:81. 26 Manyoshu 3.391,17.4025. 27 Masahide Takasaki, Koten to minzokugaku [Japanese classics and folklore studies] (Tokyo: Dan shobo, 1959), pp. 87-92. 28 Neil G. Munro, Ainu Creed and Cult (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963), p. 115. The Ainu observe certain taboos when they make a canoe. In Munro's words, "While cutting down the tree [an Ainu] would make no mention of boat-building for fear of attracting the attentions of evil spirits, who might riddle the wood with wormholes." For the same purpose, until work on the canoe is finished, it is merely called a log (saman-ni). We should also note that the Gilyaks insert inau to placate the spirit of the tree. 29 H.

Modernization, which has swept through Japan with vertiginous speed, has nearly demolished the kamui cult and their ancient way of life. The ancient world view which did not draw lines between vegetables, animals, and spirits is no more. According to Ainu mythology, God created man by taking a piece of wood to use as the spine and frame; the empty space was filled with earth.33 The Ainu have venerated trees: "The trunk, branches, leaves, flowers and fruit are but expression -manifestations-of the tree spirit which is the real substance." 34 THE STONE PILLAR In the opinion of James, "The post and pillar usually derived their sanctity from the tree." He observes that "the sacred posts and pillars had pride of place, especially in the Minoan-Mycenaean scenes and in the Semitic Canaanite sanctuaries, and to a greater or less extent wherever the tree was venerated."35 On the whole, however, his thesis deals mainly with the ancient Near East and the Mediterranean basin, and little is said about other regions of the world. As for Japan, the erection of stone pillars for cultic purposes appeared in the Middle Jomon period; and, when Jomon culture reached its late phase, a great number of stone circles of different sizes dominated the scene in the northern region of the mainland. Referring to standing pillars in a group of houses at Yasukeone in Nagano prefecture, Kidder makes this remark: "Quite obviously 31 The Ainu language is said to belong to Finno-Ugric groups. Recent investiga- tions show, however, that the Japanese language contains the same element. On the basis of the assumption that they were originally the same language, Ono estimates, by using the Swadesh method, that the separation of these two lan- guages occurred some time between 8000 and 5000 B.C. (Susumu Ono, Nihongo no kigen [The origin of the Japanese language] [Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1965], p. 206). 32 Kyosuke Kindaichi, Ainu Life and Legends (Tokyo: Government Railways, 1941), p. 16. 33 John Batchelor, Ainu Life and Lore (New York: Johnson Reprint Corp., 1971), p. 116. 34 Ibid., p. 2. 36 James, p. 33. 102</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions the platforms and pillars mark the family altar or shrine which brings together concepts of stone worship and protection for the processes of and the benefits derived from procreation."36 Both stone worship and fertility cult existed long before the dawn of the Yayoi period, in which they were so much emphasized. The previously noted sites of animal sacrifice were associated with fire pits and stone pillars (probably phallic), so that we can safely assume that the purpose of the cult was more or less to secure the profusion of animals, to say nothing of men: "The artifacts of the Middle Jomon period are replete with symbols that connote fertility. Not until after this time do the figurines become quite specifically female, but large stone clubs of phallic form, stone phalli, standing pillars in dwellings and other objects, more disguised but similarly symbolic, attest to the emphasis placed on the magical powers of the male organ."37 In relation to the stone circles at Oyu in Akita prefecture, which include a number of sundial arrangements, Kidder conjectures their relation to the sun worship and a "pillar of heaven" mentioned in Japanese mythology.38 He reasons that "the Jomon people at a later stage, perhaps 1500 B.C., were not without some recognition of the worth of sky deities, as the stone circles suggest." 39 Surely, stand- ing pillars and stone circles are symbolic expressions behind which lie the world of beliefs and cults. Furthermore, considering the mode of life, symbols, and artifacts which Jomon man created, it is most unlikely that natural phenomena escaped his attention. One of the andesite plates from the fire pit of the Togariishi site 33 has a composite picture of man, the sun, and trees (forest?). We cannot make any conclusive remark about this picture, but it suggests, at least, that the sun and trees were in the orbit of his concern. Esaka observes that the major stone circles are located on the spot from which Konide-type mountains are clearly visible. In his words, "Mount Kuromata is viewed from the Oyu site and Mount Iwaki from the Katsuyama site, Mount Himeji from the Yoriki site, and Mount Takahara from the Sanuki site."40 There is no reason to doubt that Jomon man venerated the sacred mountain, in spite of the fact that no tangible evidence to support this view is available. In this respect, the fact that the subhuman and theriomorphic expression of figurines originated in 36 Kidder, Japan before Buddhism, pp. 85-86. 37 Ibid., p. 75. 38 Ibid., p. 84. 39 Kidder, Birth of Japanese Art, p. 134. 40 Esaka, p. 128 (my translation). 103</page><page sequence="10">Sacred Tree in Japan the mountainous region of central Japan may bear some signifi- cance. Kidder's suggestion that the stone circles of Nonakado and Manza could be "early manifestations of stone and sun worship" is one possibility. The so-called sundial formation derived its name from its structure resembling a sundial, with a central menhir and a radial arrangement of river stones beneath it. The origin and purpose of cromlechs in Japan will remain obscure for a long time; some are doubtless graveyards and some are not. In any event, the Oyu stone circles were constructed with a deliberate planning which required a tremendous amount of man power. Whatever type of rites the Oyu people performed there, the site was un- mistakably intended to be a community religious center.41 Jomon man made use of trees for fuel, thatch, pillars, and tools; the tree supplied materials for constructing canoes and making weapons. Various fruits and nuts supplemented his dietary needs. In Porteus's fanciful words, "If, as might be said, man's first ideal was the life of the tree, naturally his first worship would be that of the tree.. ."42 The appearance of the snake motif and the obvious anxiety about fertility in the Middle Jomon period seem to enforce a possibility of the veneration of trees. In Holtman's words, "Evidence of extraordinary vital powers may appear to the prescientific mind in such features as great age, abnormal size, special hardihood, as for example, the retention of verdure throughout the seasons by the evergreens, or, finally, in some strange shape or prominent characteristic which induces in the beholder an unusual attitude of awareness." 43 This is surely the case in later tradition. That Jomon man venerated stones, particularly stones of unusual and suggestive shape, may have some analogical values in this context. In view of these factors, then, we may be able to apply to prehistoric Japanese religion James's proposition that "the post and pillar usually derived their sanctity from the tree." CULTURAL DIFFUSIONS AND THE SHAMANIC TREE The Neolithic age of Japan came to an end in the third century B.C., with the beginning of agriculture and the acquisition of 41 From the remains of the Oyu community came an unusual type of vessel- small, long necked, and spouted.

In the sphere of religion, new symbols began to emerge, while some of the old ones disappeared. For example, the construction of stone circles was at its peak during the Late Jomon period (roughly between 2000 and 1000 B.C.), but it gradually diminished. The production of female figurines with greatly exaggerated eyes, on the other hand, became a sort of fashion in the latest phase of the Jomon period. When Yayoi culture dawned, however, both stone circles and female figurines disappeared from the scene. Among new symbolic items, mirrors, swords, and halberds, all made of bronze, were most conspicuous. It goes without saying that artisans emigrated from Korea introduced metallurgy, but, by the end of the first century B.C., bronze weapons were produced in Japan. Moreover, those bronze weapons produced in Japan were restricted to symbolic and ceremonial uses only.44 The case of bronze bells is truly mystery ridden. In Japanese mythology, the mirror and the halberd appear in conjunction with major mythological events, but no mention of a bell is made, despite the fact that what is called "the bronze bell culture" covered the area from the east of the Inland Sea to the present Chubu district. In addition to those new symbols, in all likelihood, the spring and fall festivals began to be celebrated as agriculture advanced.45 FEMALE SHAMANIC TRADITION It seems that ancient Chinese historians viewed old Japan as a country where shamans and shamanesses rendered their services to a great extent for the welfare of the community.46 That shaman- ism was a powerful religious force in the Yayoi period is commonly assumed, but we are not equipped with materials to determine whether or not it was a new religious phenomenon coming into existence with the introduction of a new type of culture from the Asiatic continent. At very best our knowledge, admittedly ambiguous, cannot go beyond what Kidder says: "The special gifts of shamans may have already been recognized in the Jomon 44 According to Hatada, "The bronze articles, such as the Korean bronze swords, bronze spearheads, and bronze mirrors, which have been found in various parts of the peninsula, are thought to show the authority of the new chieftains, since in China, during the Ch'in and Han dynasties, iron articles were for practical use and bronze articles were symbols of authority" (Takashi Hatada, A History of Korea [Santa Barbara, Calif.: American Bibliographical Center, 1969], p. 8). 45 J.

If we follow Oka's theory, which breaks up the labyrinthine complexity of Japanese culture into different traditions, the bearers of female shamanic tradition were immi- grants from the region south of the Yangtze River who spoke Austroasian languages. This group is supposed to have reached the shore of Japan around the end of the Jomon period or the begin- ning of the Yayoi period and brought in a matrilineal social system. Furthermore, Oka postulates the arrival of an Austronesian group that initiated the technique of wet-rice cultivation and thereby gave impetus to the rise of Yayoi culture.49 In fact, Japanese, Korean, Okinawan, and Ainu shamanism is strongly colored by southern elements. For example, the shamanic soul-boat motif prevalent in Japanese protohistory aligns itself with Southeast Asian shamanic tradition. Referring to the use of a ritual boat, Eliade extracts three basic features associated with Indonesian and Melanesian shamanism: (1) the boat for the ex- pulsion of demons and sickness; (2) the boat in which the Indonesian shaman "travels through the air" in search of the patient's soul; and (3) the "boat of the spirits," which carries the souls of the dead to the beyond.50 Viewed in Japanese reli- gious tradition and more or less dissociated from the shamanic im- plication, the most obvious connection is in the third function. The best and simplest example is that the term fune meant in ancient times "coffin" as well as "boat." The painting on a stone slab of Mezurashizuka tomb in Fukuoka prefecture is arrayed with rich symbolic expressions: a boat with a bird on it, concentric circles, 47 Kidder, Early Japanese Art, p. 17. 48 Mircea Eliade, Shamanism (New York: Bollingen Foundation, 1964), p. 464. 49 Japanese National Commission for UNESCO, ed., Japan: Its Land, People and Culture (Tokyo: Ministry of Education, 1958), pp. 83-84; Joseph M.

A similar view is expressed by Ishida: "I myself would trace the route of the transmission of rice cultivation to southern Korea from the river basin of the Yangtze River through the East China Sea, skirting the Shantung Peninsula to southern Korea. Many scholars hold this view, and various proofs have been offered" (Eiichiro Ishida, Japanese Culture [Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1974], p. 56). 50 Eliade, Shamanism, p. 356. 106</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions quivers, horn patterns, a frog, etc. Kidder compares it with the boats on the D'ong So'n bronze drums of Indochina and makes the following remark: "Both the Japanese tomb boats and the D'ong So'n bronze drum boats may have shamanistic associations, but extra features in Japan have taken the boats beyond the range of pure shamanistic thought." 51 The earliest Japanese record which is similar to the first case is the myth of the Primordial Pair (Izanagi and Izanami): the first child born of their physical union was a hiruko ("leech child"), so "they placed this child into a boat made of reeds and floated it away."52 One of the colorful summer festivals, shorei-nagashi or toro-nagashi, the festival which sends off the spirits of the dead on a boat, can be mentioned in this context. The second instance of the motif, that the shaman travels through the air.by boat, can be compared with the mythological concept that kami traverse the vast expanse of space by boat- vertically (ascension) and horizontally. It would not be farfetched also to cite mifuneshiro, the container of the sacred mirror, resembling a boat in shape, placed in the Ise shrine. Although the shamanic features are no longer clearly observable in many instances, the boat motif is doubtless of southern origin.53 The Wei Chih, written around A.D. 297, has a reference to Queen Himiko (Pimiko), who "occupied herself with magic and sorcery, bewitching the people."54 She lived in seclusion, and only a few of her 1,000 female attendants had direct access to her. "There was only one man who was in charge of her wardrobe and meals and acted as the medium of communication." Her palace was sur- rounded by towers and a stockade, with the protection of armed guards. Judging from later tradition and other sources, however, Himiko was much closer to a mediumistic shamaness than to a shaman characterized by magic flight, ascent to heaven, mystical journey, or similar shamanic experiences; and by and large this is the basic feature of female shamanic tradition in Japan, Korea, and Okinawa.55 Ecstasy is a sign of possession by and contact with 51 Kidder, Early Japanese Art, p. 308.

Divination, healing, pronouncement of oracles, preadmonition, etc. constitute the major components of this type of shaman- ism. The kingdom of Yamatai which Himiko ruled was administered by the consanguineous team of brother and sister: "She had a younger brother who assisted her in ruling the country."56 With the progression of time and in proportion to the degree of insti- tutionalization of the sacred office, the power of the shamaness was removed from the arena of politics in Japan as well as in Korea, even though the process seems to have been slow.57 In Japan, the team of brother and sister was replaced by another combination of male and female, as we see in the case of Empress Jingu and her prime minister Takeushi-no-sukune, Emperor Suinin and his daughter Yamato-hime, and so on. The Okinawan situation, however, differed from both Japan and Korea, al- though the reform of A.D. 1526 initiated by King Sho II amended the traditional shamanic institution by making it a wing of the central government. There are two types of shamaness on Okinawa: noro (nuru) and yuta. The basic difference lies in the fact that the former is tied to the belief in onari-kami, meaning "sacred sister," that sisters are sacred to their brothers. The latter, on the other hand, consists of individuals endowed with shamanic gifts and is independent of the noro system. The fact that two types of Japanese shamanism, miko and itako, correspond to these two Okinawan forms surely makes it possible for us to compare the consanguineous team- ruling system of ancient Japan with the Okinawan system.58 Furthermore, Miller's linguistic analysis of the Okinawan word yuta and the Japanese itako demonstrates that the tradition of inde- pendent shamanesses aligns itself with northern shamanism. As he views it, both yuta and itako derive from or correspond to the Altaic word idugan ("shamaness") and its variations observable 1970], p. 17). However, Akiba recognizes in the Korean son-mootang the elements of Mongolian, Manchurian, and north central Asiatic shamanism (cited in Ichiro Hori, Folk Religion in Japan [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1968], pp. 186-87). Kim T'ae-gon divides Korean shamans into two major types: charismatic shaman (northern type) and priestly shaman (southern type) ("Com- ponents of Korean Shamanism," Korean Journal 12, no. 12 [December 1972]: 17-25). 56 Tsunoda et al., p. 6. 57 For a brief description of this process, see Hori, pp. 187-201. 58 For these two types of shamanism in Japan, see ibid., pp. 182 ff. 108</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions in Yakut (udagan), Buriat (udagang), northern Tungus (idakon, odakon, odogan), etc.59 The term noro seems to have a different origin. The Omoro- soshi ("sacred songs"), consisting of twenty-two books, contains 1,553 sacred songs composed in Okinawa between the end of the thirteenth century and the end of the sixteenth century. These sacred songs were understood to be oracular in nature, although many of them are stylistically refined. The more primitive form was known as miseseru (mi-seseru, "whisper"?) or uzashi, a form which excludes premeditation-that is, a spontaneous and impromptu mediation.60 Consequently, it is highly probable that the term omoro is meant to be "oracle" (u-muru = u-nuru: u as honorific and nuru meaning "utterance").61 The Okinawan designation for shamanesses, nuru (noro in Japanese), means, then, a person who is endowed with the gift of being a medium for contacts with the spirit and transmits a message which the spirit delivers. It goes without saying that the Japanese term norito is definitely related to it. THE SACRED GROVE Okinawan religion attributes the ultimate source of spiritual power to the sacrosanct place, utaki (the sacred grove), where, as a rule, the religious rites are performed in secret and where, until recent times, no male was allowed to enter. The holiest place (ibi) is located at the center of the cleared ground in the midst of under- growth, often an area where kuba trees flourish in abundance.62 The sacred object is either a rock or an aged tree to which a kami is believed to descend, and there and at the entrance of the utaki is placed a stone censer which, incidentally, came into use after Taoism reached the island. The whole scene corresponds remark- ably well to the ritual sites of proto-Shinto (iwakura) consisting of natural stones, as often exemplified in the Omiwa shrine.63 More important, the origins of the utaki and the iwakura (and himorogi) are narrated in myths. The noro and the utaki are related to each other. We have already made mention of the noro as a mediumistic person; but 59 Roy A.

Properly speaking, the noro is the chief priestess of the community, who bears upon her shoulders the full responsibility of communal affairs-social, political, and religious. The relation of the noro to the utaki should be understood in the context of the total structure of the Okinawan world view. We must not treat the notion that the utaki is the center of every village as a figurative expression but, rather, as literally true. The pioneer (nidukuru, meaning "the founding house") founded a village where the utaki was or established the utaki prior to the settlement.64 In this sense, the village constitutes a microcosm, which is complete in itself, and the sacred grove is the axis of the microcosm's social, political, and religious orientations. The pioneer of the village was known as ni-chu (literally, "root person"), in whom the civic authority was vested, while his sister became ni-gan (literally, "root kami"), the chief priestess (noro), who not only executed her religious authority but played a major role in the arena of civic affairs as the tutelary figure for her brother. "With regard to the location of shrines before the Nara period," observes Harada in his study of Japanese shrines, "we are able to say that shrines were located on more or less gentle slopes that mountains and hills provide, probably due to their relation to the cultivation of a rice paddy." 65 Okada points out that there existed a certain relationship between clans and mountains (or hills); Mount Miwa was the sacred mountain of the Omiwa clan that lived near its base, and the same relationship is discernible between the Tomi clan and Mount Ikuma, between the Kamo clan and Mount Katsuragi, between the district chieftain of Kasuga and Mount Kasuga, and so on.66 Among these, however, the Kamo shrine and the Omiwa shrine have been known since ancient times for the mythico-legendary tradition of Tamayori-hime. Tamayori-hime is a generic term for consecrated women (shamanesses) whose life was exclusively dedicated to their deities.67 There are several leitmotifs interwoven in the tradition of Tamayori-hime, all of which are important in their own right. 64 Torigoe, p. 80. 65 Toshiaki Harada, Jinja [Shrines] (Tokyo: Shibundo, 1961), p. 113 (my translation). 66 Yoneo Okada, "Miwa-san no shintaizan shink5 ni tsuite" [An essay on belief in Mount Miwa as the sacred mountain], Shintoshi kenkyi 9 (1961): 170. 67 We owe much to Yanagita's elucidation of this theme. His conclusion is that the term tama stands for "spirit," and the term yori simply means "to reside." Hence "Tamayori-hime" means "a consecrated woman to whom a spirit descends." He espouses the view that her intimate relation to her tutelary deity generated a belief in mother-son deities (Kunio Yanagita, Imo no chikara [The power of sisters] [Tokyo: Sogensha, 1939], pp. 65-106). 110</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions The theme of the mystical marriage of the shamaness to her tutelary deity cannot be separated from a Japanese belief in the "mysterious visitor."68 The same theme is also linked to another religious motif which appears to be very ancient, that is, mother- son deities.69 The myth of Amaterasu as the sacred weaver (tanabata-tsume) presents her as the consecrated woman par excellence.70 The Saigu system, on the other hand, shows another aspect of the tradition revolving around the sacred grove and the sacred tree. The miare rite of the Kamo shrine makes the relation of the shamaness to the sacred tree more explicit than any other rites.71 "In the past," comments Lebra on Okinawan religion, "the nuru [noro], the chief priestess of the community, lived much of her life in seclusion apart from fellow villagers; a special dwelling for her use was sometimes located near the sacred grove [utaki], which usually lies beyond the housing area." 72 The consecrated woman (miko) in ancient Japan served her tutelary kami in the same manner. The Hitachi Fudoki mentions a "shrine [grove] of the miko of Katori."73 In contemporary usage, the term mori means "grove," more or less free of any religious connotation; but it was unmistakably a synonym for "shrine" in ancient times, where the sanctuary consisted of a simple stone formation (or a stone-tree formation) (iwakura, shiki, himorogi, iwasaka), which Eliade describes as "the most ancient of known forms of man-made sanc- tuary" and "an effective microcosm in the most ancient stage of religious belief."74 According to the Nihongi, Emperor Sujin, the 68 See Ichiro Hori's article, "Mysterious Visitors from the Harvest to the New Year," in Studies in Japanese Folklore, ed. Richard H. Dorson (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1963), pp. 76-103. 69 Eiichiro Ishida, "Mother-Son Deities," History of Religions 4 (Summer 1964): 30-52. 70 It is interesting to note here that Emperor Jimmu's mother's name is Tamayori-hime. Though the sun goddess Amaterasu is never called Tamayori- hime, her grandson's relation to her appears to be a sort of duplication of the former or vice versa. According to this portion of the myth, the original planwas to send down her son but not the grandson. Japanese scholars have scrutinized the problem of Amaterasu, who plays a double role in the myth, namely, Amaterasu as the sun goddess and as the consecrated woman. 71 I shall not deal with the miare rite of the Kamo shrine in this paper, although this rite makes it very explicit how the shamaness and the sacred tree are related to each other. According to the Kamo tradition, the Saigu enacted the mythico- legendary scenario of the birth of the kami. The core of this rite is the sacred tree.

About the archaic usage of the term mori, see Many- 111</page><page sequence="18">Sacred Tree in Japan most controversial figure in Japanese history, made his daughter Toyosukiiri-hime the priestess of Amaterasu-O-mikami, and she in turn built the sacred enclosure (shikataki-himorigi) in the village of Kasanui in Yamato. The next emperor, Suinin, released Toyosukiiri-hime from this sacred duty and appointed one of his own daughters, Yamato-hime, to the office of high priestess. Thereupon, according to one account recorded in the Nihongi, Yamato-hime enshrined Amaterasu beneath the sacred oak (itsu-kashi) in Shiki. Mishina mentions that "in Tsushima the sacred mother and child were venerated not in a chapel but in a forest where natural stones held a prominent place." Furthermore, he compares it with a common practice in Korea where natural stones are placed at the root of sacred trees.75 It seems that Yamato-hime enshrined Amaterasu in a similar manner. Later, as instructed by the deity, she left the site of the first sanctuary and roved from province to province as mitsue ("the August Staff") until she reached the region of Ise. A ritual site was established at the upper region of the Isuzu River, and a sacred shrine (itsuki-no-miya), which came to be known as Iso-no-miya, was built.76 Needless to point out, this shrine is said to have been the protoshrine of Ise.77 To borrow Tange's picturesque descrip- tion, "By the bank of the limpid Isuzu River, amid dense forests at the foot of Mount Kamiji and Mount Shimoji stands the Ise oshu, 2.202; 4.561; 7.1344; 8.1419, 1466; 9.1731; 11.2839, 2856; 12.3100; and 13.3136. 75 Mishina notes that "the practice of heaping up stones to serve as altars for the worship of the divine was a phenomenon widespread not only in Japan and Korea, but also in Mongolia, Central Asia, etc." (Shoei Mishina, Niseen phinwa densetsu no kenkyu [Studies on myths and legends in Japan and Korea] [Tokyo, 1943], pp. 155-56; quoted in Ishida, "Mother-Son Deities," p. 39). However, the distribution of this type of stone sanctuary is global. Eliade points out that "in the Pacific Islands ... certain rocks represent or even embody gods, ancestors or culture heroes" (Comparative Religion, p. 219). I think, on the other hand, that the mauri of the Maori is to be quite valuable for our comparative studies. Best writes, "This material mauri was usually a stone, and it was carefully concealed in the forest. It acted really as a shrine or abiding place for the spirit-gods in whose care the forest was placed. In many cases the stone so used was a water-worn one of peculiar form, found in some stream-bed, or on a sea-beach. Apparently such stones were selected on account of their unusual and striking forms, just as trees and rocks of abnormal form were often viewed as tipua, the uncanny spirit- shrines..." (Elsdon Best, Forest Lore of the Maori [Wellington: Polynesian Society, 1942], p. 9). An interesting fact is that rocks and stones venerated at the Ise shrine are "from the sea, with deep markings made by the actions of waves washing over them" (Tange, and Kawazoe, p. 25). Suffice it to say at this moment that there exist many traditions which relate Tamayori-hime to stones from the sea (see Yanagita, pp. 82-90). 76 This episode is intended in every respect to explain the origin of the Ise shrine and at the same time to trace the origin of the Saigu system. 77 Historians doubt the authenticity of tradition: see Toshio Fujita and Kojiro Naoki, Ise jingu [The Ise shrine] (Tokyo: Sanichi shobo, 1960), pp. 1-30. For a 112</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions Shrine, its appearance only a little changed since remote antiq- uity." 78 In this connection, it should be noted that the province of Ise not only is the home of the Sarume family that inherited female shamanic tradition but also furnishes materials directly related to the sacred tree. While in a state of trance, the shamanic Queen Jingu learned the name of a kami of Ise: Tsuki-sakaki-itsu-no- mitama-amasakaru-mukatsu-hime.79 This name may mean, as Tsukushi interprets it, "the august spirit that descends to the sacred tree and then to the water [whence to be reborn] through the priestess."80 If so, this bewildering name is not the proper name of the kami but that of a cult rite annually enacted at Ise, the intentions and purposes of which are identical with those of the miare rite of the Kamo shrine. A tradition states that the indigenous kami of the Isuzu district was Saruta-hiko, who, in mythology, intercepted a troop of Ninigi, the grandson of Amater- asu. His shrine had no building but the sacred tree, and "This tree is the kami of the road, the kami Saruta-hiko." 81 Thus far, we have traced the relation of female shamanic tradition to the sacred grove and the sacred tree, but nothing has been said about its meaning. It is reasonable to assume that, in many instances, their relationship was more than an arcane bond surrounded by the thick clouds of mysteries. Granet's analysis that the power of the holy place and the chieftain's authority are interchangeable is worthy of note. In his study of Chinese religion, he notes that he who possessed the ruling power over communities derived his religious, political, and social authority from the holy place; and, to quote Granet's words, "The power of the chieftain and the power of the holy place have the same duration, the same extent, the same quality, the same nature."82 To illustrate the point, he cites a case of Sang-lin, the grove of mulberry trees: "Sang-lin appears in the sermon of Mei-ti as ancestral temple of the princes of Song. It appears elsewhere as god of the Soil, and it is also the name of one of the gates of Song. Again it is the name of a rebuttal, see Nagao Nishida, "Ise jingu no saishi" [Establishment of the Ise shrine], Nihonbunka kenkyusho kiyo, no. 20 (March 1967), pp. 39-122. Tsukushi believes that the original site was where the Takihara shrine is located (Nobusane Tsukushi, Amaterasu no tanj6 [The birth of Amaterasu] [Tokyo: Kadokawa shoten, 1967], pp. 16-24). 78 Tange; and Kawazoe, p. 14. 79 Nihongi, 9. 80 Tsukushi, p. 40 (my translation). 81 Sueharu Iida, Kogoshui [Gleanings from ancient stories] (Tokyo: Meibunsha, 1944), p. 115 (my translation). 82 Marcel Granet, Chinese Civilization (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1957), p. 178. 113</page><page sequence="20">Sacred Tree in Japan demiurge and of a Holy Place whose genius commands rain, drought and sickness: by consecrating himself in this Holy Place, the founder of the Yin, the ancestors of the princes of Song, obtained the right to assume his authority. The princes of Song alone possessed the cult of Sang-lin."83 The underlying concept here unmistakably runs parallel to the relation of the Okinawan shamaness to the sacred grove. Similarly, Mishina demonstrates that the Korean words supur ("grove") and spur ("capital") are etymo- logically related.84 What is common in them is not only that the sacred grove was the seat of the community, district, and nation but also that it was believed to be the axis of religious, social, and political orientation, where the first hierophanic event took place and the divine-human encounter was actualized. According to Korean myth, Purkan (the Luminous One), the first king of the kingdom of Silla, appeared in the sacred grove; in Okinawa, the origin of the utaki is ascribed to the mythological being Amami- kiyo; in Japanese mythology, Ninigi is said to have descended to Sofori (sopori, corresponding to the Korean supur and spur), and the first Emperor Jimmu began his reign at Kashiwara (probably the oak grove). An episode recorded in the Nihongi, that Kam- munatsuhime surrendered her territory to Emperor Keiko, can be interpreted along the lines of this religious belief; when the emperor's emissaries were on their way to meet her, she set up on the ship the sacred tree taken from Mount Shitsu and decorated it with a sword, a mirror, and jewels.85 A common interpretation pays much attention to the submission of the regalia to the victor; it seems, however, that the sacred tree may have played as im- portant a role as the regalia when the concession of territory was made. The sacred tree could have been a symbol of the land, just as a handful of the sacred soil of Mount Kagu represented the whole land of Yamato.86 THE SHAMANIC CROWN Some time around the end of the fourth century or around the beginning of the fifth century A.D., Japanese culture experienced 83 Ibid., pp. 177-78. 84 Shoei Mishina, "Kodai saishi to jurin" [Religious rites and government in ancient times and their relation to the grove], Shigaku zasshi 47 (1936): 748. 85 Nihongi, 7.

Prior to his conquest of the Yamato region, Emperor Jimmu sent Shiinetsu-hiko and Otokatsu to Mount Kagu to obtain its sacred soil. A similar episode is recorded in relation to the revolt of Takehaniyasu-hiko against Emperor Sujin. 114</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions another shift. Historically, this was the period in which a great number of Koreans immigrated into Japan, colossal kofun (tumuli) were built, and new artifacts of continental origin came into use among the upper class. The tripartite political struggle in Korea (among Koguryo, Paekche, and Silla) was more than an internal strife taking place on the Korean peninsula; Japanese involvement in Korean affairs accelerated the tempo of cultural changes in Japan, including the importation of new religious practices.87 In the early Kofun period, with the dead were buried mirrors, swords, jewels, spindles, etc.: in short, mostly artifacts inherited from the Yayoi culture. In contrast to this, armors, saddles, stir- rups-military accoutrements-and other items such as crowns and shoes of gold and silver were placed in tombs around the beginning of the fifth century. Among these later objects, however, one type of crown is noteworthy. Kidder classifies Japanese crowns according to three types: (1) the Korean type, (2) the type related to central Asia, and (3) the local type.88 The gilt bronze crown from the Funayama tomb in Gumma prefecture is decked with standing trees, a motif identical to that of a gold crown from a Silla tomb in Korea.89 The crown from the Sammaizuka tomb in Ibaragi prefecture has an alternating design of horses and trees placed on the upper rim. Kidder compares it with the Scythian gold crown decorated with precious stones which has two standing trees and three ibexes on its upper rim. In the case of the Scythian crown, the composition unmistakably replicates the motif of the Tree of Life in the Near East. Referring to the Sammaizuka crown, Kidder comments, "Alternate horses and trees stands on it, the central tree and its opposed horses follow the centuries-old heraldic pattern of the Near East."90 The appearance of a Near Eastern heraldic pattern in the isolated nation of islands in the Far East reflects the interfusion of various cultures in Eurasia. Rudenko summarizes well the situation in which east and west were entwined in the northern sphere of the Asiatic continent: It is not merely a case of connections between the steppe tribes themselves, but of links between them and the peoples of the then advanced countries, the world cultural centers of that period. Thus the Black Sea finds clearly 87 About Egami's theory dealing with the invasion of the Tungusic people, see Japanese Culture, ed. Robert J. Smith and Richard K.

Even in Outer Mongolia, where the influence of China showed itself very deeply in the culture of nomadic tribes in its normal form, materials have come to light testifying to the acquaintance of the ancient Huns with the products of Graeco-Bactrian craftsmen. In High Altai province links have been established with central and Hither Asia, and to some extent with China. Especial importance attaches to the Pazyryk finds of articles of high technical and aesthetic quality produced by the Persian and Chinese crafts- men, which throw new light on the level of culture in those countries at this remote time. It is not surprising therefore that the Altai tribes had so much in common with other pastoral peoples developing in contact with the cultures of the classical East and China.91 The Kozlov Expedition which excavated the valley of the Selenge River uncovered the tombs of Hsiung-nu chieftains who were contemporaries of the Han dynasty in China. Unearthed articles included Han silks, Iranian textiles with Hellenistic art motifs, embroidered hangings which "have a purely Greek design," etc. "The Selenga tombs therefore," writes Fitzgerald, "afford a direct proof of one important channel of diffusion between the Hellenised east and the Han Empire."92 The flow of Scythian culture into China via nomadic tribes of north Asia was a matter of course; the question is simply the degree of its influence. To this question, Fitzgerald gives a clear-cut answer: "The Han artists ... employed the Scythian style of ornamentation not only in bronze and other metal work, but also into textiles."93 The design of a piece of silk made in Han China, unearthed from the frozen tomb of Noyon Uul (a rich excavated site to the north of Ulaanbaatar on the Selenge River in Mongolia), is noteworthy: a seven-branched huge tree stands between two rocky mountains (?), each with a large bird perching atop it.94 The composition resembles to a remarkable degree that of a Mesopotamian motif on some cylinder seals. A wall hanging in felt applique from Pazyryk bears a picture of a seated shamanic figure holding a tree with seven blossoms (the Tree of Life?), together with a man on horseback in front of the figure.95 91 Sergei I.

The inscription mentions that the sender was not familiar with this unusual shape: "In previous years even the king of Paekche has never seen a sword like this." The sword, "beaten 100 times," was believed to possess magical power. The recipient seems to have understood the symbolic meaning of the sword, but it is not certain whether the meaning of the sacred number 7 was grasped by the ancient Japanese.97 As Eliade points out, this sacred number plays a major role in the shaman's tech- nique and ecstasy in central and north Asia, and it eventually reached Japan via Korea, probably around the time of the Kofun period.98 The dissemination of the Scytho-Altaic culture in the Far East has been ascribed to the rise of the Hsiung-nu. The eastward movement of the Hsiung-nu, the Hsien-pi, and the Wu-han threatened China on its northern border, to which Ch'in China responded by constructing the Great Wall. Their metal culture and formidable military force stimulated the development of the eastern Manchurian Puyo people and the Koguryo people of north Korea (they are related) and marked their appearance on the historical scene. They were not only the first Manchurian and Korean peoples to establish tribal states but also subsequently played a major role (particularly the Koguryo) in Korean history until the conquest of the kingdom of Koguryo by T'ang China and the unification of Korea by Silla. "Before Korea was unified by Silla," writes Hakeda, "the tribes which inhabited it differed greatly in customs, languages, and form of government."99 Hakeda attributes their differences to the natural environment in which they lived and their political conditions, rather than to ethnic origins. 96 Nihongi, 9. 97 The sacred number of ancient Japan seems to have been 8, although old records contain both 8 and 7. Shiratori assumes that the number 7 reflects the Chinese influence (Kurakichi Shiratori, Shindaishi no kenkyu [The study of ancient Japan] [Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1944], p. 11). However, the appearance of the sacred number 7 in relation to Empress Jingu (she was possessed by kami for seven days and seven nights) may indicate that the ancient Japanese were familiar with this sacred number earlier than Shiratori assumes. 98 Eliade, Shamanism, p. 278. 99 Hatada, p. 25. 117</page><page sequence="24">Sacred Tree in Japan As for ancient Korean religion, ancestor worship, shamanism, and the worship of the sky god dominated, which runs parallel to the religion of the nomadic peoples of north Asia. Tree symbolism associated with the gold crown of Silla and Japanese crowns (imported from Korea) doubtless reflects the diffusion of religious motifs from the region of the Black Sea (including Mesopotamia) to the Korean peninsula. The second king of Silla, Namhae, was called ch'ach'aung, which seems to mean, according to Hatada, "a shaman who serves the spirits." 00 The aforementioned myth of Purkan and the title of Namhae indicate that the crown with the standing trees was understood to be a shamanic emblem, and in all likelihood it symbolized the cosmic tree. Finally, we note a passage of the Wei Chih dealing with the history of Mahan, one of the three kingdoms of ancient Korea which dominated the central and southern portion of the peninsula. The passage states that the people of Mahan set up a tall tree, hung it with bells and drums, and worshipped the spirit.101 The bells and drums are doubtless the most conspicuous shamanic emblems of north Asiatics. Japanese mythology mentions a similar practice. When the sun goddess Amaterasu concealed herself in the cave, the assembly of kami plotted to lure her in the following manner: "They uprooted by the very roots the flourishing masakaki (evergreen tree) of Ame-no-Kagu-yama (Mount Kagu in Heaven); to the upper branches they affixed long strings of myriad maga- tama beads; in the middle branches they hung a large-dimensioned mirror; in the lower branches they suspended white nikite cloth and blue nikite cloth." 102 The three articles mentioned in Japanese mythology are quite different from their Korean counterparts. As Philippi points out, "Hanging mirrors and cloth offerings on branches of uprooted trees was a common practice in ancient Japanese worship," 03 but the earliest date indicated the use of these symbolic items is no earlier than the Middle Yayoi period.l04 The absence of bells and drums in the episode of the sacred tree does not mean that the ancient Japanese were not interested in these instruments and did not employ them in religious rites. "The Japanese acquired a limited appreciation of dangling objects 100 Ibid., p. 21. 101 TakashiAkiba, "A Study on Korean Folkways," Folklore Studies 16 (1957): 9. 102 Philippi, p. 83. 103 Ibid., no. 13. 104 The newest item among these three articles is no doubt the mirror. The oldest one would be the magatama jewels. In Kidder's words, "Towards the close of the Jomon period these were being cut out of stone in the North . . . "(Japan before Buddhism, p. 69). I assume that the use of cloth in this fashion could be no earlier than the Yayoi period. 118</page><page sequence="25">History of Religions [preeminent features of the Scythian artifacts] from Silla in Korea, but showed their preference in more firmly attached percussion articles, like the spherical bells," writes Kidder.105 We read in the Kogoshui that the shamaness Uzume, while dancing, held in her hand a halberd to which bells were attached.106 A curious object which Kidder calls "the shamanic mirror" is a mirror to whose rim bells are affixed. The inverted wooden bucket (oke) on which Uzume "stamped resoundingly" could be in effect an instrument to induce shamanic trance.107 In addition to these instruments, the use ,f a harp (koto) to bring about shamanic trance is most conspicuous in ancient Japan. "There are good reasons for believing," says Holtman, "that trees were the original shrines of Shinto and that trees were not added to primitive god-houses... but that god-houses were provided for trees.... " 108 And there is no doubt that "a tree is regarded as sacred in proportion as it manifests life." 109 What the shamanic crown reveals, then, is that in the Kofun period the religious motifs and beliefs of north Asiatics began to appear in concrete form; and the frequent contact with Korea, to say nothing of the arrival of immigrants from Korea during the reign of Emperor Ojin (the beginning of the fifth century), sharpened the Japanese attitude toward the sacred tree. It seems also that the relation of takagi-no-kami (literally, "lofty tree") to Amaterasu can be construed along the line of these two shamanic traditions- that Amaterasu as the prototype of tanabata-tsume was associated with the sacred tree, but her relation to the sacred tree was enforced when the Siberian shamanic tree (takagi) was incorporated with it.110 Oregon State University 105 Kidder, Early Japanese Art, p. 184. 106 The account of the Kogoshui is identical with the Chinkon rite. For the Chinkon rite, see Kiyotsura Yatsuka, "Chinkon sai ni tsuite" [On the Chinkon rite], Shintogaku, no. 16 (1958), pp. 14-28, esp. p. 16. 107 Matsuoka conjectures that the inverted wooden bucket functioned as a musical instrument (Shigao Matsuaka, Shinpen Nihon kogo jiten [New dictionary of archaic Japanese words] [Tokyo: T6eshoin, 1937], p. 126). 108 Holtman, p. 3. 109 Ibid., p. 2. In Eliade's words, "The tree came to express the cosmos fully in itself, by embodying, in apparently static form, its 'force,' its life and its quality of periodic regeneration" (Comparative Religion, p. 271). 110 Hori, Folk Religion, p. 192, n. 14; Philippi, pp. 511, 566; Takeo Matsumura, Nihon shinwa no kenkyu [Studies in Japanese mythology] (Tokyo: Baifukan, 1955), 3:512. The term takagi (takaki) may also mean "high fortification," "moun- tain fastness," "hill," etc. However, it is "undoubtedly connected with trees, perhaps a remnant of ancient tree-worship. The connection of this name with Taka-mi-musubi-no-kami, a deity of generation, is interesting in that generative force was often symbolized by trees or posts in Siberian shamanism" (Philippi, p. 596). 119</page></plain_text>
