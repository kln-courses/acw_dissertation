<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Brian Richardson University of Maryland Recent Concepts of Narrative and the  Narratives of Narrative Theory Now, narrative is everywhere. The study of narrative continues to grow more  nuanced, capacious, and extensive as it is applied to an ever greater range of fields  and disciplines, appearing more prominently in areas from philosophy and law to  studies of performance art and hypertexts. Nor is there any end in sight: the most  important new movement in religious studies is narrative theology, and there is even  a new kind of psychological treatment called “narrative therapy.” Cognitive science  offers experimental evidence for a claim that only recently was the hyperbolic boast  of a practitioner of the nouveau roman: that narrative is the basic vehicle of human  knowledge. Or in the words of Mark Turner: “Narrative imagining—story—is the  fundamental instrument of thought. [. . .] It is a literary capacity indispensable to  human cognition generally” (4-5). In literary, cultural, and performance studies, narrative theory continues to  expand, whether in the burgeoning field of life writing or in the analysis of drama  or film. It is no exaggeration to say that the last ten years have seen a renaissance in  narrative theory and analysis. Feminism, arguably the most significant intellectual  force of the second half of the twentieth century, has (as should be expected) ut- terly and fruitfully transformed narrative theory and analysis in many ways. Virtu- ally every component of or agent in the narrative transaction has been subjected  to sustained examination, including space, closure, character, narration, reader  response, linearity and narrative sequence, and even the phenomenon of narrative  itself. Some of these reconceptualizations, as Honor Wallace’s article in this issue  demonstrates, continue to be debated and refined. Broader-based gender criticism and queer studies steadily followed the rise of  feminism, some results of which are likewise evident in this issue. Though rather  less work has appeared from other marginalized or “minority” perspectives so far,  these are certainly areas that can be expected to provide significant contributions  in the near future. Already, several important studies are available, including work  on narrative and race, and in postcolonial studies much attention has been devoted  to the construction of imperial and national narratives. Other movements in critical  theory from Lacanian analysis to “nomadology” to new historicism have been readily  applied to narrative study and have often produced impressive results. Elsewhere  in the field, a new kind of interdisciplinarity is quietly emerging, as developments  168 Style: Volume 34, No. 2, Summer 2000  </page> <page sequence="2"> Recent Concepts of Narrative 169  in artificial-intelligence theory, hypertext studies, the concept of “possible worlds”  in analytical philosophy, and advances in cognitive science are applied to narrative  theory. Narrative thus seems to be a kind of vortex around which other discourses  orbit in ever closer proximity. Another interesting development is represented by the work of a number of  younger scholars who retain the analytical rigor of traditional or “classical” ap- proaches while moving far beyond the relatively limited theoretical parameters of  structuralism to address new questions posed by postmodern texts and positionali- ties. These theorists (including Ruth Ronen, Tamar Yacobi, Brian McHale, Monika  Fludernik, Emma Kafalenos, and Patrick O’Neill) have produced a number of  groundbreaking studies that are necessitating a radical rethinking of concepts that  hitherto have been foundational to narrative theory: the distinction between fabula  and syuzhet, the nature of narrative time, the concept of plot, the notion of voice,  and the concept of “the” reader. They have applied analytical methods to irrever- ent postmodern narrative practices and formulated a number of original positions.  Though I suspect that some will reject the name (and perhaps the company) I am  constructing for them, I will nevertheless refer to these works as gesturing toward  a “Postmodern Narratology.” What is Narrative? Currently, four basic approaches to the definition of narrative are in use; we may  designate these as temporal, causal, minimal, and transactional. The first posits the  representation of events in a time sequence as the defining feature of narrative; the  second insists that some causal connection, however oblique, between the events  is essential; the third and most capacious, Genette’s, suggests that any statement  of an action or event is ipso facto a narrative, since it implies a transformation or  transition from an earlier to a later state; the fourth posits that narrative is simply a  way of reading a text, rather than a feature or essence found in a text. In additional  to these four, Monika Fludernik in an essay in this volume draws on linguistics to  differentiate narrative from other text types. Of these positions, the most commonly employed are the temporal and the  causal stances.1 Gerald Prince has defined narrative as “the representation of at  least two real or fictive events in a time sequence, neither of which presupposes or  entails the other” (Narratology 4); this formulation appears to be the most widely  cited of any definition. On the other hand, Dorrit Cohn has recently stated that the  following is a fairly consensual definition of narrative: “a series of statements that  deal with a causally related sequence of events that concern human (or human-like)  beings” (12). Choosing between these two positions can be difficult; for many,  mere temporal sequence is too weak a connection, as the following statements  may suggest: “Long ago, Theseus slew the minotaur; yesterday, the mail came  late.” On the other hand, the demand for “causally related” events may seem too  severe: many events in a given narrative—especially a picaresque or postmodern  </page> <page sequence="3"> 170 Brian Richardson one—may have only the most tenuous connection to the material that surrounds it. In this instance, it is probably most useful to look to adjacent arts, such as film  or painting, in which a group of contiguous representations may or may not con- stitute a narrative sequence. Here David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson provide  a telling test case of a series of cinematic images: “A man tosses and turns, unable  to sleep. A mirror breaks. A telephone rings” (55). Alone, this is a non-narrative  sequence. But one can postulate connections that would weave these images together  into a narrative: the man can’t sleep because he’s had a fight with his boss, and in  the morning is still so angry that he smashes the mirror while shaving; next, his  telephone rings and he learns that his boss has called to apologize. In this example,  causal ties are necessary to produce the work’s narrative status; without them, it is  merely a suggestive montage. My own preferred formulation is the following: narrative is a representation  of a causally related series of events 2.  This definition would include verbal as well  as nonverbal narratives (in painting, ballet, mime, etc); “causally related” would be  understood as “generally connected” or part of the same general causal matrix—a  much looser, more oblique, and indefinite relation than direct entailment; and it  is further assumed that numerous nonnarrative elements may comfortably reside  within a larger narrative framework, as Porter Abbott demonstrates so effectively  elsewhere in this issue. But, as Gerald Prince goes on to suggest in the ingenious  questions that conclude this volume, the story may not end even here. What are  we to do with dreams, prophecies, memories, and recipes—all representations of  causally related events in a time sequence (though many dreamers are notoriously  lax in supplying causal connections)? I leave these for other theorists to tease out. The Narratives of Narrative Theory In America, a single, rarely questioned master narrative of modern critical  theory has dominated literary studies for some time. It is an extremely familiar  account; one of its versions runs as follows: at the beginning of the twentieth cen- tury, criticism was dominated by philological studies, historical and biographical  speculation, and an impressionistic humanism. These were supplanted by various  types of formalist approaches, one important strand of which culminated in the  structuralist promise of a comprehensive, rigorous, linguistically grounded, objec- tive, disinterested science of literature. Beginning in the late sixties, a number of  poststructuralist theories challenged this orthodoxy and soon overthrew it, setting in  its place a new series of issues, questions, methods, and valorizations that seriously  addressed ideological issues, established the positionality of the reader, examined  historical contexts, and affirmed the inherent impossibility of disinterestedness  in such endeavors. Just as formalism had rightly succeeded the facile yet barren  impressionism of earlier humanistic critics, the ideologically sophisticated and  politically engaged schools that succeeded the formalists swept away the mania  for structure, spurious objectivity, pretentious system building, false claims of  </page> <page sequence="4"> Recent Concepts of Narrative 171  organicism, and scientistic excess. This master narrative is so well entrenched that it is rarely questioned or in- deed even noticed, and occasionally attempts are even made to map it (however  clumsily) onto the very different history of narrative theory. These attempts invari- ably prove inadequate; indeed, the history of narrative theory itself contradicts the  critical narrative just outlined. Like all seamless, streamlined historical accounts  that follow a teleological pattern and lead to a conclusion that is both satisfying  and inevitable, the poststructuralist master narrative is palpably untrue; the rise,  fall, and metamorphosis of critical positions over time is much more complex than  such a simple pattern can express. As Jerome McGann has stated, “history is a field of indeterminacies, with  movements to be seen running across lateral and recursive lines as well as linearly,  and by strange diagonals and various curves, tangents, and even within random  patterns” (197). The same of course is true of the history of criticism and theory:  it is necessary to radically narrow the definition of what constitutes “Theory,” to  minimize the formalists’ fascination with parody and defamiliarization, and to posit  an artificially unified poststructuralist subject that obscures its multiple schisms  in order for this narrative to seem compelling.3 Poststructuralist insight into the  interestedness of all discourse also contains a blindness that does not seem to al- low this knowledge to be reflexively applied to the narratives it tells about itself. In narrative theory proper, a very different scenario has unfolded, as the more  traditional approaches (neoAristotelian criticism, structuralism, linguistics) have  been augmented though not displaced by important new work grounded in feminism,  deconstruction, new historicism, “minority” poetics, and queer studies. The exclu- sionary antagonisms that have fueled theoretical debates elsewhere in criticism and  theory are often absent here; the choices available to the narrative theorist include  the option of “both/and.” Furthermore, several distinct kinds of interaction can be  seen at work: we find the uneven incorporation of some poststructuralist methods  and concerns into existing narratological practices—some want only a taste; others  take large drafts; all generally choose carefully which nonformalist discourses they  will embrace. Then there are what might be termed “maverick poststructuralists”  like Peter Rabinowitz, Michal Peled Ginsburg, and Jay Clayton, whose analyses are  as vital as they are difficult to categorize. In the writings of yet other narratologists,  poststructuralism does not have much discernible effect at all. A striking feature of the contemporary theoretical scene is the continued sig- nificant presence of older schools. Marxist and Freudian paradigms of narrative  analysis have been active and productive for most of the century, despite regular  reformulations of and internecine struggles over central features and methods  (indeed, it is one of the ironies of the history of criticism that revised versions of  these nineteenth century doctrines have routinely been called “post” structuralist).  Similarly, models derived from both linguistics and the basic approach of the Chi- cago school have yielded impressive results for over seventy years and continue  </page> <page sequence="5"> 172 Brian Richardson to do so. Many of the authors of more traditional though classic works have gone  on to produce ingenious accounts that extend or exceed the boundaries of their  earlier formulations: I am thinking here of studies like Gérard Genette’s work on  the paratext, Dorrit Cohn’s analysis of simultaneous narration (96-108), and Gerald  Prince on the “disnarrated.” Still more illustrative is the unlikely history of the morphological approach to  the fundamental elements and transformations of story 4.  In the twenties, Vladimir  Propp developed this framework as part of his study of the Russian folktale, and  derived thirty-one basic story functions from the thousands of examples he had  investigated. Soon after, formalism was suppressed by Stalin, and Propp’s work  was thereby prevented from being widely known in literary circles for many years.  In the sixties and seventies, however, it served as a touchstone for several structur- alists (including Greimas, Bremond, Todorov, and Prince) who sought to extend  and revise Propp’s model and map out a universal narrative grammar. This project,  after generating considerable initial interest, was rapidly abandoned and had nearly  expired by the end of the eighties; it came to appear to many, especially in the U.  S., to mark the worst extremes of scientistic excess and reductionism. Suddenly,  however, it re-emerged in slightly altered form as a central aspect of some types  of cognitivist approaches to narrative (see Herman). Against all odds, narrative  grammar is back in fashion again. It would seem that in the history of narrative  theory, old models don’t die a timely death—they simply pause for a few years  before being resurrected in a moderately new form. In fact, it is hard to think of  a major tradition of narrative analysis that has been definitively abandoned; even  Northrop Frye’s somewhat hoary archetypal theory has recently been refashioned  within Allen Tilley’s work on “plot snakes.” The actual evolution and development of narrative theory cannot begin to be  grafted onto the master narrative of critical theory as told by the poststructuralists.  Indeed, the story of modern narrative theory does not fit well into the frame of any  narrative history. There are far too many story strands, loose ends, abrupt turns,  and unmotivated reappearances of forgotten figures and theoretical approaches to  fit easily within any one narrative structure. The history of modern narrative theory  is more accurately depicted as a cluster of contiguous histories rather than a single,  comprehensive narrative. Noting comparable problems in the writing of literary history, David Perkins  recently suggested that one is ultimately forced to choose between either a neces- sarily false narrative history or the unwieldy and intellectually deficient form of  the encyclopedia (53-60). I suggest instead that for both literary and critical history  we use the model of the chronicle, with its minimal causality, openness to multiple  stories, and abandonment of teleological trajectories, in order to represent more  accurately the purposive clutter and unpredictable successions of the polymorphous  past.5 The chronicle form allows us to chart the varied trajectories of several dis- parate, competing theories in operation at the same time; it encourages us to note  </page> <page sequence="6"> Recent Concepts of Narrative 173  the continuities, interruptions, permutations, and divisions of these models over  time. Eschewing a simple, linear, teleological model, we can be more alert to the  abrupt emergences, hibernations, revivals, forkings, and disappearances of different  critical schools over time. The essays in this volume amply illustrate the wide range of impressive work  being done in narrative theory today as well as the persistence and continued utility  of many earlier explanatory models. The first three intervene directly in ongoing  debates involving different strands of narrative theory. In “Desire and the Female  Protagonist,” Honor Wallace critically examines basic aspects of feminist narrative  theory, in particular the opposition between lyric and narrative and the frequent  valorization of the lyric mode as a progressive alternative to the masculinist biases  of traditional narrative trajectories. In “Maurice in Time,” Jesse Matz argues per- suasively for a new kind of narrative temporality in Forster that he terms “tense- lessness”; though eccentric to typical modernist deployments of time, “tenseless- ness” gestures toward a homosexual form that would elude constricting notions of  “identity.” Eyal Amiran analyzes the work of three central poststructuralist theorists  (Peter Brooks, Deleuze and Guattari, and Michael Fried) and demonstrates how  each ultimately confuses figuration with poetics, just as the earlier theorists they  critique had done; Amiran goes on to offer an approach to the text that eludes this  and other comparably faulty binary oppositions. Daniel Punday in turn imagines  what a thoroughgoing narratology of the body would look like and shows how basic  concepts of narrative theory (character, plot, space) depend on an understanding  of bodies that has yet to be adequately articulated. The next three essays look at the concept and definition of narrative from  different vantage points. Philippe Carrard examines three types of modern history  writing both to determine whether a genuinely nonnarrative history exists and what  its features might be. Building on cognitive science, Porter Abbott, by contrasting  the dissimilar ways in which “narrative” and “literature” function, provides a bet- ter understanding of each while revealing the large conceptual gap between them.  Monika Fludernik, drawing on the resources of linguistics, utilizes text-type theory  to better comprehend narrative as a discourse type. The issue concludes with two important investigations into basic concepts of  narrative analysis that turn out to have significant implications for more general  theoretical concerns. David Herman on the one hand, scrutinizing the concept of  reflexivity, differentiates it sharply from metalanguage and identifies a distinctive  type of “lateral” reflexivity that produces a series of changing versions or “self- paraphrases” of basic material, rather than a hierarchical order of distinct levels—a  differentiation found elsewhere in narrative discourse, and one that illuminates core  cognitive principles. Dorrit Cohn, on the other hand, breaks down the unwieldy  category of “unreliable narration” into the more useful subtypes of “misinformed”  and “discordant”; in doing so, she discloses discordant narration to be an exclusive  property of works of narrative fiction. </page> <page sequence="7"> 174 Brian Richardson In addition, further demonstrating the utility and consequences of the conceptual  frameworks in question, the theory in these essays is in almost every case applied  to—and helps to reinterpret—an array of narratives by Fay Weldon, E.M. Forster,  Rudyard Kipling, Toni Morrison, Patrick Modiano, and Joseph Conrad. If one may  venture a single, self-conscious teleological surmise, it is that narrative theory is  reaching a higher level of sophistication and comprehensiveness and that it is very  likely to become increasingly central to literary studies now that the dominant  critical paradigm has begun to fade and a new (or at least another) critical model  is struggling to emerge. Notes 1  The limitation of most transactional definitions is that they usually seem  to beg—if not miss entirely—the central fact that some texts (e.g., an anecdote)  produce or reward a narrative response more than other kinds of texts (such as a  mathematical equation). The main problem with Genette’s conception (“as soon  as there is an action or an event, even a single one, there is a story because there  is a transformation” [19]) is that it is far too inclusive to be of much use; virtually  any description at all (not only, “The sun is up,” but also “The sun is hot”) thus  becomes a narrative, since it implies a transition from an earlier state to a later  one. I believe that narrative, however, presupposes a minimal amplitude. Several  of these rival definitions are discussed at some length in my book, Unlikely Stories  (89-107). For Prince’s recent assessment of Genette, see “Revisiting Narrativity.” 2  This definition was first proposed in Unlikely Stories (105), which includes  additional discussion of this issue and its varied theorists. I see no reason to limit  narrative, as Cohn does, to human agents (including anthropomorphic entities);  the story of a glacier’s advance and retreat or the development of a solar system  strikes me as being eminently narrative. 3  A deconstruction of the poststructuralist account would point to femi- nism’s independence of (and feminists’ occasional hostility to) deconstruction  and psychoanalysis and note that for most of the twentieth century Marxism and  psychoanalysis have, for instance, opposed rather than complemented each other  as interpretive projects. 4  The extreme brevity of the following account necessarily collapses some  important distinctions between different practitioners; for a more thorough version  of the relations between Propp and the structuralists—and among the structuralists  themselves—see Culler (205-24) or Ronen. 5  I use the term “chronicle” as Hayden White has described it: situated halfway  between narrative proper and the purely chronological annals, it “often seems to  wish to tell a story, aspires to narrativity, but typically fails to achieve it. More  specifically, the chronicle usually is marked by a failure to achieve narrative clo- sure. It does not conclude so much as simply terminate” (5). For a chronicle-style  account of the history of modern fiction, see my “Re-Mapping the Present,” which  </page> <page sequence="8"> Recent Concepts of Narrative 175  elaborates some of the arguments set forth here.
