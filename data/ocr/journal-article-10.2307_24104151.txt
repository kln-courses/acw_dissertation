<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEETING REPORTS Spatial technologies for natural hazards and management* About 160 scientists, professionals and students from various institutions partici pated in the two-day Convention and Symposium of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing. Seven foreign scientists from Germany, USA and Japan also par ticipated and presented papers. The theme of the Symposium was 'Spatial Technologies for Natural Hazards and Management'. The theme was important for the people of Uttar Pradesh (UP) who witness various kinds of natural hazards every year like the recent Uttarkashi and Chamoli earthquakes, Malpa landslide, numerous forest fires, snow avalanches in the Himalayan region, droughts and lightning. In his inaugural address, S. K. Acharyya (Director General, GS1) drew the atten tion of the earth scientists and the remote sensing community to the basics of earth system and called on them to formulate strategies and plans to meet the challen ges of natural hazards, increased needs of minerals, metals and energy for the industry to feed the increasing popu lation, taking note of environmental im pact of unplanned anthropomorphic exploitations and plan for remedial actions. He stressed the significant role of remote sensing and GIS for the earth scientists. In the special technical session on 'natural hazards', three invited papers and five contributed papers were pre sented. The invited paper on the 'Use of satellite data for avalanche prediction and control' by S. S. Sharma [Director, Snow Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), Chandigarh] dealt with the importance of multi-date remotely sensed data to moni tor snow cover by different snow-cover simulation models. This was demon strated with the help of a multimedia presentation. The efforts being made by scientists from SASE in generation of digital terrain model and studies of the slope aspect, change in the snow surface structures and properties were presented.
