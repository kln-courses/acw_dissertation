<plain_text><page sequence="1">Why the Orders Belong in Studio CARROLL WILLIAM WESTFALL University of Notre Dame The Orders, the long-time emblematic centerpiece of architectural education, were banished from studio in the United States a half-century ago. They were exiled to the curriculum's sparse offerings in history when the Bauhaus system of education in architecture displaced the Beaux Arts system. The Orders stand for an entire system of design based on recognizable building components, proportionality, and coherence. Their presence would improve the formal qualities of designs across the entire spectrum from buildings addressing the increased interest in traditional qualities in buildings to those pushing forward the legacy of Modernism's founders, men who themselves knew the Orders well. The Orders, the emblematic centerpiece of archi- tectural education for more than two millennia, were banished from studio in the United States a half-century ago. They were exiled to the curric- ulum's sparse offerings in history when tfie Bauhaus system of education in architecture displaced the Beaux Arts system. While traditional practice lin- gered on in a few remote architectural offices and in Henry Hope Reed's tireless championing of Beaux Arts classicism,1 traditional instruction in the Orders, and instruction in tradition they exempli- fied, was soon expunged from both the schools and the profession. It is time for them to return. The two most common current reasons for maintaining the Orders' exile are that buildings must be innovative, and the Orders inhibit creative innovation and that buildings must be "of our time" and the Orders belong to a different time. The Pritzker Prize rewards innovation and timeli- ness, and using the Orders will certainly not win you a Pritzker. But not every client wants a Pritzker Prize-worthy building or even a Pritzker wannabe. Indeed, most seem to want a kind of soft-core Modernism that post-Modernism made legitimate, something that suggests Modernism but also evokes traditional architecture, something perhaps "contextual." Some clients even want hard-core and explicitly traditional architecture because they find old-looking things more appealing than things made to look new or because they wish to add to and complement a well-done, existing, beloved, traditional setting. Both soft- and hard-core traditional buildings are assuming an increasing portion of work coming from architects' offices. Over the past two decades, clients are finding an increasing but still small number of architects who are as good as any of their predecessors, and instruction in the Orders is once again available. The Institute for Classical Architecture and Classical America in New York City and its affiliates elsewhere sponsor programs and classes devoted to classical architecture. The Uni- versity of Notre Dame offers accredited under- graduate and graduate professional degree programs in traditional and classical architecture and urbanism, instruction that also exists as a niche within a handful of other programs. And since 2003, the Driehaus Prize has acknowledged excel- lence in classical and traditional architecture. But excellence, and even competence, in both soft- and hard-core traditional architecture is the exception. Builders working without the assistance of architects do most of the traditional work, and most of it is not very good. Architects doing traditional work all too easily please their clients with columns and other things that let the building fit it or that give it the appearance of traditional buildings. But for those with eyes that can see, this traditional work is to architecture what bad spelling, faulty grammar, and the S turned backward are to writing or an out-of-tune soloist is to a symphony orchestra. Recent work at the University of Virginia provides examples. The local firm VMDO was apparently so intimidated that when, working in Jefferson's shadow, it left the abacus off the Doric capitals of the grossly detailed colonnade it added to the football stadium, a version of the Doric Order that, a few years later, it tacked on their huge, clearly Modernist box holding a new basketball arena to identify it with sports and establish a contextual fit to the university (Figure I).2 VMDO blinked in Jefferson's presence. Stanford White, Fiske Kimball, Robert A.M. Stern (at his already- destroyed O Hill Dining Hall), and others not only did not blink but even rose to the challenge of finding new forms that are congruent with the Orders' canonic restraints and local traditions. But the more recent trend is to strike out on one's own and give a personal twist to the university's Jef- fersonianism. At his ill-fitting Bryan Hall, Michael Journal of Architectural Education, pp. 95-107 Â©2008 ACSA 95 WESTFALL</page><page sequence="2">Craves chose to indulge in the then-currently fashionable minimalism rather than seek a knowing comment on and enrichment of architecture's for- mal traditions, as Jefferson and every good tradi- tional architect have done (Figure 2). Those who try to meet Jefferson on his own ground find the going very hard. Consider Warren Cox's recently completed Harrison Institute and Special Collections Library (Figure 3). Its columns mimic Jefferson's at the nearby lawn, although the proportions of Cox's columns are gross and their profiles and workmanship are faulty. They form a colonnade calling to mind those on the lawn that is interrupted by a central arch that lacks tectonic clarity. Its narrow-end facades erupt into similarly technically inept columnar bays. Its attic has the diminished height of that element's source, the low-level connectors between Jefferson's rotunda and the lawn's pavilions, but the attic, which unlike its source lacks tectonic clarity, sits awkwardly atop the colonnade, resulting in a squat building unable to assume the dignity it deserves among the immediate neighbors on the quad it helps define. No wonder these and other inept essays in Jeffersonianism stirred many in the faculty in the School of Architecture to publish an ad in the stu- dent newspaper lamenting the poor quality of the traditional architecture and accusing the Board of Visitors of using traditional architecture as "branding" when they should be sponsoring designs right for the times.3 It needs pointing out that the Cox firm has done notable traditional work, but this building reveals the deficiencies in education that lead to poor results. Rather than being good traditional work, it is contextual, a basis for design that draws on little more than what can be seen with eyes trained in Modernism in the immediate formal context in which the building is to be built. "Con- textualism" is the surrogate for knowledge of the tradition that shapes the context and that is itself enriched by that context. The vast bulk of work actually turned out by architects is neither extreme Modernism nor hard-core traditionalism, occupying instead a middle ground that allows the building to maintain contact with the foundations of Modern- ism and evoke some recollection of traditional forms. To improve its quality requires a better training in traditional architecture than is currently the norm, training available by bringing the Orders back from exile. This same training also has the capacity to improve Modernist designs. It was, after all, the foundation from which the Modernists launched their revolt. The traditions the founders rejected disciplined their work, whether by being distilled to a minimal but authoritative presence or by providing a counterpart to what they believed the new age required.4 The successors of those early Modernists have looked more at the product of the revolt than at the early revolutionary work. Knowledge of the Orders will provide a firm foundation for whatever architects wish to erect on it. What the Orders Can Do for a Building The term "the Orders" refers to more than mere ornamental columns appearing as bit players in the classical tradition, and it is in this expanded sense that the term "the Orders" is being used here. When their presence is explicit, the columnar Orders are indeed the principal ornament of the buildings that deserve their presence, and they are the most conspicuous emblems of the principal ordering principles of proportionality and coher- ence of the formal organization necessary for beauty in architecture, a role they can play even when their presence is only implicit, in astylar 1 .

(Photo by author.) buildings.5 Furthermore, the Orders also provide a vivid representation of the role material plays in forming the building's structure.6 They might be the actual structure we see, as in an ancient Greek temple, or they might merely represent structure with nonstructural materials such as molded bricks and stucco added to the walls and vaults that constitute the actual structure, as we see in Fran- cesco Borromini's surfaces both inside and outside San Carlino alle Quattro Fontane in Rome (and who would give up what we see there merely because it is "false"?). In both cases, the Orders tell the truth about structure, in the former case with details, profiles, and proportions that elevate building to architecture, to use Demetri Porphyrios' phrase, and in the latter by using fiction to tell the truth about the building's stability, recalling that truth- telling is the role of fiction, as Aristotle explains in the Poetics.7 In a word, the Orders provide a "fusion of tectonic form and aesthetic principles."8 Those tectonic and formal principles can discipline the design of a beautiful building no matter its style, its time of production, or its architect's personal vision. The Mediterranean, which first brought the classical Orders to canonic form, has ever since drawn architects to the long and careful study aimed at acquiring the judgment they need to invest buildings with beauty. Le CorbusieKs sketchbooks reveal his fascination with the linkage between the columnar Orders and the ordering principles of the plan, elevation, and massing of the buildings' beautiful play of forms in the light that ravished him on his first contact with ancient clas- sicism in 1911 in Athens on the Acropolis and in Pompeii.9 Measuring, drawing, and sketching the Orders and their installation, whether implicit or explicit, in buildings train the eye in the proportional dimensioning of parts, of their coherent assemblage into wholes, in rhythmic relationship between various parts and the masses they form, in an assembling of materials so that they possess tectonic conviction, and in the difference between well-turned and merely adequate profiles in a building's parts and masses relative to the material, the light, and the observer's viewpoint. The columnar Orders also make buildings immediately intelligible to nonarchitects. Modernist styles have made new buildings increasingly alien to outsiders. But traditional architecture's familiar forms invite conversation among laypeople and architects who can reason together to come up with beautiful buildings that serve their needs. Except within the inner circle of fashionable architects and their clients, people think of buildings as parts of the places in which they pursue their dreams. They accept the idea that not all buildings are of equal dignity in serving the variety of their activities and therefore do not deserve the same qualities of beauty. School buildings are more important than municipal garages, and churches outrank bowling alleys, a sentiment captured well in a New Yorker cartoon (Figure 4). Modernist buildings tend to treat all buildings as equally important examples of their designer's style, and so Modernism itself has failed to develop the variety of formal devices that make hierarchical distinctions distinctive. How to make a hierarchical calibration clear is most easily learned from the very broadest range of traditional buildings, especially from those descending from the classicism that originated in ancient Greece. People also tend to think that a well-designed, well-built, serviceable building that contributes to the grace of a place they love is a beautiful building. Modernist theory and instruction have little truck with the concept of beauty, leaving beauty to reside in the eye of the beholder and its perception to be its own reward.10 Almost a century ago, Geoffrey Scott, a vigorous champion of traditional classicism, provided support for this position by dismissing as fallacies the various kinds of extraformal content that critics had said furnished a building with beauty, arguing instead that the properly ordered mass, space, line, and coherence of a building's forms repay our "disinterested enthusiasm for architectural form" and satisfy the "disinterested desire for beauty" residing in the center of our humanity.11 More recently, several noted Modern- ists have enriched this purely self-referential, form- based understanding of beauty.12 But it is fair to argue that among people in general, there is more to beauty than mere enjoyment of architectural form. They retain the understanding that beauty is in some way the accompaniment of the justice sought since time out of mind by the civil order that buildings serve and that seeking beauty is somehow connected with seeking justice.13 This belief vests beauty and justice with timeless attributes and acknowledges that a building 97 WESTFALL</page><page sequence="4">4. Michael Maslin, cartoon, The New Yorker, October 5, 1987. owes a larger obligation to the place in which people live together over time in political societies seeking justice than to transient conditions marked by time. Buildings identify the quality or character of a place, whether it is urban or rural (which will be treated as one here, while the nonplace of sub- urbia will be ignored, just as architects do), and they reveal the aspirations of those who build and live in it. Any new building is an intruder that will affect for good or ill the formal representation of those aspirations. The architect can make a civil contribution, or he can boorishly proclaim the superiority of his building to all others that have preceded it. To be civil, a building must account for how decorum is served by the buildings it will join, and it must join with its neighbors in calling up other buildings in other places with which it is to be associated. Consider three colleges or univer- sities. Thomas Jefferson's Academical Village fits early Federal Virginia and the vision the Founders had for the new United States among the great nations of the world. The additions closest to its Jeffersonian core comment on Jefferson's original buildings and subsequent buildings in Virginia and elsewhere, and both Jefferson's originals and their civil successors evoke the best of ancient Greece and Rome, although here as in the others, most of the more recent additions have been mediocre as architecture and ill-fitted to the place. Jefferson's secular, state-sponsored University of Virginia contrasts markedly with the contemporaneous Amherst College where the Congregationalists in Massachusetts sought to maintain orthodoxy in their teaching and retain a central place for religion even as the state was disestablishing religion (Figure 5). Students were housed in a pair of dour brick dormitories hardly distinguishable from the mills rising along New England's water- ways while instruction occurred in the chapel, libraries, and classrooms of the central, spare brick building with a wooden tower and generous wooden-columned front, apparently the product of the Northampton builder Isaac Damon, sited atop the brow of a hill: No nonsense here! A century later at Yale University, by then like Amherst largely secularized, an extensive building campaign dominated by James Gamble Rogers deftly inserted into an existing campus and its surroundings new buildings that would call to mind the enduring contribution to civilization of the university, a gift of the middle ages now adapted to serve the modern world. These places are valued as places because they fit an existing locale or region and evoke associations with admirable realms rather than merely displaying a fleeting fashion or an individualistic vision. So far, buildings have been asked to fill a tall Order: be beautiful; represent their service to the highest aspirations of individuals; contribute to the beauty of cities, landscapes, and institutions; make evident that these places serve the highest aspira- tions of individuals; reveal something they can never hide, namely, the time and place in which they were produced; and, by the way, leave enduring evidence of the ability of the architect to fill this order. Architecture at its best does so but only when buildings call on the Orders to discipline their design either implicitly or explicitly. Let me suggest that this is more than a formal issue, that it resides in the Orders' being both the formal and the metaphoric analogues to the form and figure of man, which in the Western tradition we inhabit is acknowledged to be the best creation within nature, an individual who is responsible for his own destiny and who fulfills his nature in political communities. The Anthropomorphic Analogy The Orders can fulfill this task because they establish the formal analogue between the form and figure of man and the people who build and use what they build.14 In purely formal terms, the base, shaft, and capital analogize the feet, legs- and-trunk, and head of the human body, a tri- partition all Orders share just as people do, just as 5.

Why the Orders Belong in Studio 98</page><page sequence="5">they share proportionality and coherence in the assemblage of the pieces composing them (Figure 6). They also establish a formal similarity between buildings and the materials nature provides for building them, as when columns call trees to mind (Figure 7). These formal differences between the different Orders come not from rearranging where the various parts are placed (e.g., swapping the base for the capital), or from marking a part, say, a capital so wildly divergent from a capital's customary form that it can only with difficulty be identified as a capital and can hardly find a place within a coherent proportion- ate whole, or from making a building's top dis- proportionately heavy relative to its bottom. Such distortions make people unattractive, just as they do buildings. Different conditions call for different forms, but the three qualities of an unmistakable formal appearance, proportionality, and coherence are common to all well-designed buildings based on the Orders, whether the columnar Orders and other conventional components are explicit, as with free-standing or applied columns or pilasters, or in diluted and abbreviated form, or implicit, as when limited to nothing more than a properly proportioned sill and cornice and span of blank wall in between (Figure 8). Legitimate differences always respond to tradition's guidance so that the differences are easily graspable in the same ways, one might say, in which the differences between people are or faces are. My face or your face is like no other face, and neither are yours and mine together like any other type of face, say, a dog's or an owl's. Yours, mine, and everyone else's are unique, and it is also a member of a typical class of like things. Differences that contribute positively to proportionality and coherence attest to the architect's abilities as he responds to contingent conditions ranging from the particular quality of light to differences in materials, technology, budget, and skill of the workmen. In every case, to the eye that can see, how well these are handled will reveal the architect's ability to invest the building with beautiful architectural form and will locate the building in a particular and unique place and time. Endowing whole buildings and their conven- tional components with proportionality and coher- ence is the tremendously flexible tool of tripartition. It disciplines the Orders' ramification as 6.

Abrams, 1991), p. 141. when the base, shaft, and capital itself become the middle portion of a tripartition that includes the support of a stylobate, podium, or plinth and the push upward into an entablature or arch, which are conventional components that themselves are nominally divided into a comprehensible triplet of related pieces. The assemblage of smaller pieces into a larger conventional component reveals their ability to provide a vivid representation of struc- ture, allowing the building to appear stable and secure, a result that can be achieved equally well with actual means, as Creeks and Renaissance Italians usually did, or fictively, as Roman and Baroque architects often preferred.15 The formal clarity arising from the anthropo- morphic analogy makes possible representational clarity, a task the Orders have borne ever since the Creeks began the process of developing their canonic forms.16 The differences between the Orders have often been seen as marking out the differences between people, from the rural rustic (Tuscan) to the sophisticated and highly decorated lady of the city (Composite) at the extremes and the heroic male (Doric), the chaste matron (Ionic), and the virginal young woman (Corinthian) in between. Just as proportionality and coherence seek a comity between the different parts of a building, so too does the political order seek a comity between different kinds of people. It is no coincidence that the Creeks first gave the Orders distinctive conventional forms during the same period in which they invented political science and the architectural conventions that served the religion that bound them into a political order and that their elaboration into what would become canonic forms occurred as Creek philosophy matured.17 And it is not happenstance that the Orders have been essential to the public and pri- vate and the sacred and secular buildings serving the political orders erected on these ancient foundations. Whether large like a nation or small like the university at Jefferson's Academical Vil- lage, a political order is a place in which individuals seek to perfect their natures. Buildings are nec- essary for that task, and the variety of forms that the Orders make possible stand as the most con- spicuous emblems of the proportionality and coherence of the architectural ensemble serving that aspiration. The Orders give a building speech to present its role in all that is most important about our place in the world and to our humanity. A prime example of this interchange between political and architec- tural Orders, loved by architects and laypeople alike, is Jefferson's University of Virginia where he Why the Orders Belong in Studio 100</page><page sequence="7">reserved the Corinthian for the library, the Tuscan for the students, and an instructive variety of ancient and modern examples of the other Orders for the professors' pavilions. A similar difference is evident in two superb, nearly contemporaneous buildings in Washington, John Russell Pope's chaste, Ionic National Gallery, and Cass Gilbert's rich and august Corinthian Supreme Court Building. They reveal how similar conventional components, both parts and wholes, can be ornamented to any extent that decorum demands for clarifying and enhancing the building's meaning in a range run- ning from luxuriant splendor to chaste simplicity without inhibiting the Orders' immediate identity, obscuring their formal properties, or interfering with their tectonic legibility. The differences of their enrichment arise from their civic purpose, not from the predilections of their architects, although the differences in the personal style of each are clearly visible. The form of the political order and the form of its buildings shared a common basis that used reason, experience, and judgment to seek justice through the state and beauty through the build- ings serving it. The Orders were the most con- spicuous emblems of that linkage. Vitruvius used the idea to elevate mere building to the higher realm of architecture and make buildings worthy of Augustus' Rome.18 Later, it would justify elevating architecture to the status of a liberal art, that is, an art necessary for a free person exercising the arts of citizenship.19 But for that status, there would be no reason to allow schools of architecture within universities today or to think that the practice of architecture is somehow assisted by theory. During the earliest and most productive period of the recovery of knowledge about the Orders and about the ancient way of building, words were more powerful and provocative in conducting this dis- course than actual things seen: recall that the sur- viving copies of Vitruvius and Alberti's architectural treatise were not illustrated. In the later fifteenth century, architects began keeping sketchbooks with images of ruins and conjectural restorations. To learn about the Orders and the other ancient conventions principally through written theory and in sketches based on ruinous fragments required a constant recourse to judgment. To explore the Orders was to exercise and hone one's judgment about matters architectural, and it still is for architects who consult actual examples by sketching rather than merely peering at books showing old buildings and the designs of new ones.20 All these changed in the wake of Sebastiano Serlio's treatise of 1537, the most widely available early book to present architectural images inte- grated with words (Figure 9). On one page for the first time, a person encountered an image showing five Orders rising from a common baseline.21 Else- where, he showed plans, elevations, and sections of whole buildings and of conventional components both ancient and modern. And he stressed the role of the Orders as the principal ordering principle for buildings done in the ancient and modern manner. The images, especially of the Orders, produced the book's lasting impression. Its wide circulation and of the others that followed it canonized the Orders as a group consisting of those five with the form particular to each and with a particular role to play in the various conventional components that they used and ordered. Book now followed book, pro- viding easy access to these canonic forms, which suggested that using them in those forms was to use them "correctly." The easy availability of the "correct" forms nourished people who understood that reason and knowledge as embodied in the Orders linked the state and buildings and the aspiration for justice and beauty. They now had available examples that could be assessed relative to both word and Â¡mage, that is, against a body of written theory about the Orders and within the larger syllabus of liberal knowledge and within the visual parameters established by examples that were considered 9. Sebastiano Serlio, The Five Books of ArchitectureiLondon: Robert Peake, 1611; reprinted New York: Dover, 1982), IV, fol. 3. authoritative. Able architects could use the Orders with greater subtlety, and interested laypeople could gain greater familiarity with the Orders' canonic forms. With canonic conventions well established, the departures from the canon could be more evident and the reason for the departure more easily appreciated. The greatest beneficiaries of this material were the people in the newly formed United States who were distant from actual buildings in the old world. The new Americans eagerly took up the discourse, conducting it largely in formal rather than in verbal terms. Theirs was a new kind of political order, one founded on the proposition that all men are created equal, which meant that the affairs of a state that sought justice for all its members now rested in</page><page sequence="8">10. Diego de Porres, Las Capuchinas, Antigua, Guatemala, 1731. (Photo by author.) everyone's hands. Reasoning and knowledge became the essential tools both for seeking justice and for representing that quest with beautiful, useful buildings. The Orders were pressed into service in the new public buildings to represent the new nation's aspirations to foreigners and to connect the new citizens with their predecessors running back to ancient Greece. They were also to provide models for the proper use of the conventions of architecture with the hope of making knowledge about architecture as widely available as knowledge of correct spelling, grammar, and letter forms; the sound of a well-tuned instrument- familiarity with the conventions of decent behavior in public; and the expectations attendant on the duties of the citizen in public and in private life. Were this not so, the varied use of the Orders and the rich variety of conventional compositions in Thomas Jefferson's projected and built work and in that of Pierre Charles L'Enfant, William Thornton, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Charles Bulfinch, Thomas U. Walter, and others right down to the architects of the Federal Triangle would have been barren exercises.22 But just as the easy availability of the correct forms in published sources could nourish thought, so too could it undermine the role of judgment. In the aftermath of the Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns in the late seventeenth century, the beauty embodied in the Orders' proportions was dismissed from the transcendental realm and low- ered to mere familiarity arising from custom. The Enlightenment further eroded their authority, so when new technologies and materials became available during the nineteenth century, the col- umns and various conventional components Serlio and his successors had illustrated showed up in sales catalogues of prefabricated interchangeable parts, their easy procurement facilitating the con- struction of buildings of lesser status and debasing them as bearers of meaning. But more important buildings were still produced by architects who understood the Orders' ability to invest the building with beauty and give it its appropriate place among other buildings and who knew that each building responded to unique circumstances requiring that it receives a unique form. These architects, like their predecessors, understood that the meaning carried by the Orders and the extended apparatus of classical forms (to use Sir John Summerson's felicitous phrase) is intelligible only when they are used within canonic bounds in both public and private and in both architectural and urban applications. Use in all these realms ties alt of them together. Their forms will differ depending on the role they play and the effect of the contingencies of time and place on their design and construction, but the variation will occur within the parameters of their canonic forms. The canon must be honored because deviations from a constant can be seen only if the constant is constant, but a canon providing the constancy is a framework for exercising judgment, not a straitjacket for making doctrinaire designs or assessments. 11.

The Orders' Meaning in Particular The characteristics that reveal the quality of the architect's judgment can be sorted into four cate- gories. First, judgments reconcile the tensions between the abstraction of canonic examples and the realities of local materials, local conditions, the capacity of local builders, and the elasticity of the budget. For example, the column drums in ancient Creek Orders are often bedded with extreme pre- cision and without mortar,23 while the Romans proclaimed the extent of their power in both poli- tics and engineering by employing huge monolithic shafts brought from quarries all across the Medi- terranean world. Virginia is the land of red brick buildings and columns made of brick and stucco and usually painted white but which might instead be coated with sand made from local stone, as Jefferson did at the University of Virginia. In New England, the columns that in antiquity were believed to be stone imitations of wooden proto- types were rendered in wood whether the rest of the building was brick or wood (Figure 5). In Antigua, the colonial capital of Guatemala, the diameter-to-height ratios, which in canonic practice run from 1 to 6 up to 1 to 11, were altered to something less than 1 to 2 in response to seismic conditions (Figure 10). Second, judgments arise from taste or other criteria that are independent of tectonics and construction. Ancient Romans found Creek build- ings too spare, while Roman luxury offended ancient Creeks. Renaissance clarity was cloying for those who indulged in the Baroque's exuberance that eighteenth century purists then condemned, calling to mind the slogan about the eighteenth century, early curly, later straighten Twentieth- century masters in central Europe such as Otto Wagner and Jose Plecnik who worked in the aesthetic environment of fÃ¬n-de-siÃ¨cle central Europe pushed traditional forms to, and in the opinion of some beyond, acceptable limits, while their contemporaries working in the United States mined new riches from the ancient, Renaissance, and Baroque quarries. Third, judgment is required to enable archi- tecture to produce new kinds of buildings and to bring new materials and technologies to architec- ture's service. The ancient Romans vastly expanded the scope of the conventional components and building types on the foundations left them by their Creek predecessors, a task taken up again by the Italian Renaissance masters, particularly Bramante, who inherited the ancient Italian legacy. From the decades around 1800 down to the present day, architects have continued the expansion as they incorporate new materials into buildings that are both canonically sound and serving new, never- before-seen functions. 13.

Fourth, and finally, judgment particularizes the Orders to serve some special purpose. For example, after the Italians had reestablished and expanded the canon in the sixteenth century, non-Italians sought to nationalize that inheritance from the Mediterranean while maintaining its canonic iden- tity, a task for which the Corinthian is an especially tempting target. In the sixteenth century, Philibert de l'Orme designed an Order suitable for unique French circumstances (Figure 11), as did Claude Perrault working at the Colonnade of the Louvre's east front and Jules Harduoin-Mansart at the chapel at Versailles, both for Louis XIV. In his translation of Vitruvius in 1673, Perrault wrote that the Gothic precedents of France had persuaded him and his colleagues "to invent a sixth manner of placing columns, which is to join them two by two, and also to place the space of two Â¡ntercolumnia- tions in one. . .," that is, free standing, paired, with very long entablature spans made possible by technologies reaching back to late twelfth-century construction at Notre Dame in Paris (Figure 12).24 In this country, Benjamin Henry Latrobe Ameri- canized the Corinthian by producing tobacco and corn capitals that found successors on the frontier where John M. Van Osdel linked St. Joseph County in Indiana to the nation by using a derivative of the Latrobe corncob capital for the 1854 courthouse (Figure 13). Walter followed Latrobe by working American vegetation into the capitals of his U.S. Capitol Extension. More recently, in 1984, Allan Creenberg enriched and nationalized the Corinthian Order in his building of the Treaty Room of the U.S. State Department by incorporating the Great Seal of the United States in the capital and tobacco leaves, blossoms, and seed pods in the room's vertical moldings and the antechamber doorways' architraves. The Role of Canonic Conventions In a lively tradition, new work, whether it responds to material conditions, decisions based on taste, new demands, or the desire to particularize an Order, never annuls inherited conventions. Instead, in every case, high-quality work introdu- ces innovations that enrich tradition and sheds new light on the canon's potential. The pride a person takes in his innovation suggests that it ought to be assessed relative to standards that are higher and more enduring than that which is available in some particular moment such as "our time," in some moment of the past (as occurs in Neo-Classicism and Neo-Gothic), in some limited locale investigated in the name of contextua I ism or on some other desks in studio, or in what is cur- rently being published in the professional journals. That higher standard is in the work that was produced across time by Mnesicles, Bramante, Christopher Wren, or John Russell Pope. To make that assessment, the armature for the design must be the canonic standard for the kind of work it is as that standard is embodied in the best examples Why the Orders Belong in Studio 104</page><page sequence="11">1 5.

A voice singing in a shower might sound good, but how good is it compared to Luciano Pavarotti's in an opera house? Choosing mediocre standards for comparison produces only mediocre work or worse. Canonic forms are spread across a very broad catalogue of conventional components. The les- sons their study teaches can guide the design of the full range of things found in buildings, from the Orders on down to common steps. The Orders because they occupy the highest rank are the most fecund in possibilities for enrichment and inno- vation, but so too are steps despite the quite pedestrian purposes they serve: one needs to think only of the contrast between the front stairs and a servant's back stairs in a row house or the great ascending piazza in Rome, Alessandro 16.

Duncan Stroik, thesis advisor. Specchi's Spanish Steps from 1721-5. Both the Orders and steps and all the components in between carry with them both the scalar rela- tionship to the form and figure of man and, as is especially the case with the Orders and various conventional compositions, the meanings that connect people to the natural world and the civil society in which they live. In the studios of architecture schools, con- ventional forms based on the machine analogy such as the corner window or curtain wall and extravagant inventions indifferent to tectonics and even to function have replaced the traditional forms embodying the anthropomorphic analogy. Modernism's conventions have not yet demon- strated the capacity for continual enrichment or for carrying the rich content that forms derived from the anthropomorphic analogy can. A person might have said the same thing in the first century of experience in ancient Greece with what would become the classical apparatus of forms whose emblem is the columnar Order, so perhaps we must simply wait and see what can become of Modernism's conventions. But while waiting, people outside the narrow confines of the leading edge of architecture will continue to want build- ings that retain contact with the founding origins of Modernism, that seek an accommodation between Modernism and a familiar tradition, or that can take their appropriate place within a set- ting redolent with traditions in form and meaning whose beauty represents the aspirations for justice and which link past and present and the timeless and the timely. These people will be better served by architects whose education included acquiring a profound knowledge of the Orders than by those who know little more than what they learned in a history course or by looking at the buildings next door to their site. Gaining this knowledge requires different training from that which goes into the training of Modernists- different but not incompatible. While Modernist training has shown itself to be inade- quate for producing good traditional buildings, the reverse is not the case: training in producing good traditional buildings assists in producing good Modernism. It was, after all, this training, with its body of knowledge, discipline, and sensitivity to proportion, light, texture, and the entire range of formal attributes that building can display, that the heroic early Modernist masters commanded. And it is what Le Corbusier valued highly enough to fea- ture in what turned out to be a posthumous pub- lication of his earliest experience with ravishing architectural form. Illustrations of Using the Orders in Studio Figure 14. The teacher of theory at the Ãcole des beaux-Arts presented these as examples of compositions that are both "identical . . . and as different as possible." He explains (p. 146) that they rise from the same base and reach the same height but that all vertical and horizontal dimensions in each one are different. The Orders provide the organizing principle governing their compositions, which defy imposed formulae but illustrate the freedom available for the architect's invention. Figure 15. This, the third studio project for students entering the professional program with nonarchitecture undergraduate degrees, is pro- ceeded by the first exercise in which the students learn to draw the Orders and a second that explores the role of the Orders in organizing the composi- tion, disciplining the tectonics, and defining the space of a simple aedicule to house a prescribed statue. Here, the aedicule becomes an element in the composition of the street wall for a building the student designs that began as an orangerie but now is to serve as a teahouse overlooking a garden on an exclusive residential street in Chicago's Gold Coast. Figure 16. This sheet leading to the design of a theater for youth-oriented performances in Honolulu, Hawaii, illustrates the exploration of the form a columnar Order should take as it accounts for local materials, tectonic traditions, and decora- tive patterns and the role it will play in ordering the spatial and formal design of the most general aspects of the building. Figure 17. The Orders, given a form appro- priate for the materials, building traditions, and local forms found in Haiti, provide the ordering principle for the composition of the plan and ele- vations of this complex.

The colonnade is contextual in that its origin is in the well-detailed, much-loved, and surviving Tuscan colonnade from 1911 to 1913 at the original football field. 3.
