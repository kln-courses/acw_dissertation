<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Shicur Qomah: Texts and Recensions. By MARTIN SAMUEL COHEN. Texte und Studien zum Antiken Juden- turn. Tilbingen: J. C. B. MOHR, 1985. Pp. vii + 240. The Shicur Qomah: Texts and Recensions is an indis- pensable edition of one of the most controversial texts in the history of ancient and early medieval Judaism. Revered by mystics and vilified by medieval anti-Rabbinist intellectuals and Rabbinic rationalists (as well as early modern rationalist scholars of Judaism), the Shicur Qomah is a striking example of extreme anthropomorphic tendencies in Judaism of Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages. The Shicur Qomah purports to describe the body of God in graphic detail, lists precise and extravagant numbers for its measurements, and assigns mysterious names to each part of the divine anatomy. The text is closely related to the Hekhalot texts, most of which have been published in Peter Schafer's Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur (Tubingen: Mohr, 1981) and his Geniza- Fragmente zur Hekhalot-Literatur (Tiibingen: Mohr, 1984). Although the Merkavah Rabbah version of the text was included in the Synopse (??688-71 1), much Shicur Qomah material was not. Cohen's earlier study, The Shicur Qomah: Liturgy and Theurgy in pre-Kabbalistic Jewish Mysticism (Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 1983), was a comprehensive account of the historical and literary-critical issues of the text. Differing with Scholem, Cohen argues persuasively that the Shicur Qomah is a liturgical text that attained its prin- cipal form in the Geonic period. According to Cohen, the text originally functioned as both "liturgy and theurgy" and was brought closer to the genre of Merkavah mysticism by later generations. (The term theurgy is apparently used by Cohen to refer to the linking of the results of mystical experience to practical ends.) That study also included a</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 583 translation and commentary of the Sefer ha-Qomah recen- sion of the text. The pr~sent volume consists of transcriptions of the major recensions of the text, each represented by a "base" manu- script with variants placed below in a critical apparatus. Clear and accurate translations accompany these transcrip- tions. Many of the manuscripts used for this edition are not included in the Synopse. In an introduction, Cohen's earlier historical conclusions are summarized and critical issues are discussed. There are also no fewer than sixteen appendixes containing material from important manuscripts of the text, quotations of the Shicur Qomah in other works, and lists of secondary references to the Shicur Qomah in medieval Jewish literature. The author brings a wealth of learning in Rabbinic literature and Jewish intellectual history to bear on the text. Each recension and appendix is accompanied by brief but valuable critical notes, supplying biblical references and cross-references to the other recensions of Shicur Qomah and to Rabbinic and cognate literature. Thus the volume gives scholars access to much important material not found elsewhere. Cohen has taken on the difficult task of identifying the principal recensions of the text and describing the relation- ships between them (pp. 4-25). Each of the principal recen- sions has a distinctive redactional character and program. Most include material not found in the other recensions. At least two of the recensions bear internal evidence that they are cohesive adaptations of earlier material. The Sefer Ha- Shi'ur recension reworks Shicur Qomah material into a kind of "mathematical Midrash" of the divine dimensions based on a table for converting earthly units of measurement to heavenly dimensions (11-13). The redactor of the Siddur Rabbah recension states that he has excerpted from other texts. He is hesitant to reveal magical names and added a testimony from God Himself warning against the use of the Shicur Qomah tradition for magical means (pp. 14-17). Thus the individual recensions can be read as texts in their own right, each reflecting a somewhat different set of concerns. The publication of an edition of a Hekhalot text is not merely a significant event for the study of that specific literature; it must take its place in an ongoing debate about the nature and shape of early Jewish esoteric literature. This debate bears on the way Rabbinic and other ancient Jewish texts are studied. In the Synopse, in which manuscripts were placed side-by-side in columns, and in subsequent essays, Schafer has argued that most of the Hekhalot texts cannot be considered "books" or "documents" with well-defined redactional boundaries going back to an original text. The classical critical edition, which presents a "base" manuscript or constructs an "ideal" eclectic text and under this text records "variants" to that manuscript, often presupposes an Urtext from which these variants arose. Schafer argues that, in the case of Hekhalot literature, this presupposition is mistaken. Rather, manuscripts combine parallel materials in strikingly different ways. Thus any edition of a Hekhalot text must take into account these gross variations in form and demonstrate its literary coherence. Schafer's argument raises historical and interpretive questions beyond the process of creating critical editions: is an ancient Jewish text something that has attained a definitive form at a particular moment in time, or should its diverse forms be seen as manifestations of a continuous dynamic process extending, in the case of the Hekhalot literature, from Palestinian antiquity to medieval Germany? Cohen takes Schafer's arguments into account in his introduction. He has wisely chosen to title his edition The Shicur Qomah: Text and Recensions, rather than "The Shicur Qomah: A Critical Edition," acknowledging the varied forms that the Shicur Qomah takes. Nevertheless, he argues that there was in fact an Urtext of the Shicur Qomah from which other recensions derived. He tentatively identifies one manuscript (British Library MS 10675) as a copy of that Urtext. He also presents the major recensions separately rather than publishing all the manuscripts synoptically. This method of presentation has certain advantages over the synoptic method. It recognizes that all manuscripts are not equal-that many manuscripts are clearly secondary copies of a Vorlage. For example, in the Hekhalot text Ma'aseh Merkavah (=??544-596 in the Synopse), MSS Dropsie 436 and Munich 40 are practically identical, and seem to be derived from MS Oxf. 1531 or its Vorlage. This reviewer's study of Macaseh Merkavah has turned up few meaningful variants in these manuscripts that cannot be explained as misreadings of the Oxford manuscript's version. At the same time, by presenting the recensions separately, this method also accords them a legitimate place in the history of the text, rather than relegating them to the background. Thus Cohen does not allow his argument that the recensions developed from an Urtext to dictate the way they are arranged in the edition. However, this method also has its limitations. In synoptic presentation the "texts" emerge as clusters of pericopae, shifting between versions, rather than books with clearly defined beginnings and ends. In Cohen's method of presenta- tion, the relationships between versions do not stand out in such relief. He might have performed an additional service to the reader by including a synoptic table of the recensions depicting the relationships of pericopae between the recen- sions, perhaps keyed in to the Sefer ha-Qomah recension as the Synopse was to MS NY 8128. Often large blocks of significant material are placed in the critical notes as variants. This is especially inconvenient in the Sefer ha-Qomah recen- sion, which actually consists of two sub-recensions. There the longer recension, which includes extensive hymns, is placed in the apparatus.</page><page sequence="3">584 Journal of the American Oriental Society 110.3 (1990) Cohen makes important points in his case for an Urtext of the Shicur Qomah. British Library MS 10675, a tenth- or eleventh-century manuscript, presents the Shicur Qomah as an independent unit, contains the pericopae most common to the various recensions of the Shicur Qomah, and has literary coherence. However, of the principal recensions, only two, the closely related Sefer ha-Qomah and Sefer Raziel recensions, present material in the same sequence as the British Library manuscript. Thus we still cannot be sure if the texts the redactors of the other recensions had before them derive from this Urtext. Moreover, all recensions contain much material which is apparently of Talmudic or Geonic provenance, such as extensive Hekhalot hymns. Furthermore, when we examine British Library MS 10675 we see that it, too, is a composite. For example, lines 97-122 (corresponding to section F in the Sefer ha-Qomah recen- sion) are clearly a gloss on lines 7-92 (= section D). It is apparent that the process of composition began in stages before the compilation of this Urtext and obviously con- tinued after it. This student of Hekhalot literature, while agreeing that ms Brit. Lib. 10675 represents an early stage in the de- velopment of the text, would cast the conclusions somewhat differently: The manuscript is an example of the Urform of the text-that is, the principal recension of the text in its earliest form. We can indeed speak of a Shicur Qomah. But it should not be identified merely with the Urtext-the trunk, so to speak, of the philological tree. When we study "The Shi'ur Qomah" we study the entire tree, from its liturgical roots to its theurgic recensional branches. Fortunately, this edition, which takes account of the trajectory of the text as well as its supposed origins, allows us to do so. Martin S. Cohen has provided us with the necessary resources, and then some, for the study of the Shicur Qomah. MICHAEL D. SWARTZ UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA</page></plain_text>
