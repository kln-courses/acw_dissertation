Drubach * Daniel O. Claassen Published online: 27 June 2008 © Blanton-Peale Institute 2008 Abstract One of the most significant existential dilemmas for the religious person is the discrepancy between the assertion that God is everywhere and eternally present, and the inability to become aware of His presence. In this paper, we discuss how developments in our understanding of the brain's mechanisms for perception may resolve this apparent contradiction. We submit that if God is eternally present and unchangeable, then by the process of neuronal habituation, an individual can be "unaware" of the presence of God. We also discuss the limits of human perception and illustrate the biblical questions concerning the awareness of God. Keywords Neuronal habitutation • Awareness of God • Theophany Introduction Religious individuals who believe in the existence of God suffer from the perceived inability to become aware of God's presence. There exists an existential inability to volitionally experience God, via the human sensations of sight, sound, touch, taste, or smell. Recent advances in neuroscience have lead to neurologic explanations of perceived awareness of God, by suggesting that alterations in normal consciousness, such as auditory and visual hallucinations, dreams, and even epileptic events, accompany these moments (Snyder 2008). The writings of the Jewish and Christian faiths highlight this struggle. Job laments, "Would that I knew how to reach God, how to get to his dwelling place... Behold, I go forward, but He is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive Him" (Job 23:8-9); David also cries, "Hide not Your face from me" (Psalm 102:1, Psalm 143:7). How can God be eternally present and yet hide in such a way that we are not aware of His presence? We submit that the answer is contained within one of God's attributes, His constant, D. A.

"For I am the Lord, I do not change" (Malachi 3:6). This concept of unchangeability is also contained within the definition of God as "a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth" (Boyd 1856). This definition encompasses not only the unchanging substance of God, but also the unchanging attributes of God. God's unchanging nature encompasses not only anthropomorphic attributes, such as His 'personality,' but also includes His essence, or entity. God is described as the "Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change" (James 1:17). His essence, therefore, is unchangeable. Having defined Himself as "I AM who I AM" (Exodus 3:14), it is reasoned that "the existence of the Creator... is an Existence that is perfect (and absolute) in all facets of existence" (Kaplan and Maimonides, 1984). For the purpose of this discussion, God's unchanging substance and being will be emphasized as the essential characteristic of His nature that results in an inability to perceive Him via the perceptual characteristics of human exteroception. The perceptual apparatus contained in the brain is organized in such a way that humans readily perceive changing sensorial information, but cannot perceive an unchanging stimulus. We argue that this aspect of human perception, called neuronal habituation, explains why an individual cannot perceive God with perceptual senses. That is, God's presence is so constant that our brain habituates to His being, and He thus appears to be absent. This will hopefully explain the discrepancy between the premise that God is eternally everywhere and the nature of our inability to perceive Him. Characterizing Awareness and Perception Before discussing the issue of awareness of God, it is important to consider the concept of awareness. The definition the concept of awareness itself is plagued by the difficulty in defining the experiential nature of awareness. The function of awareness can only be experienced in the first person. The same difficulty can be encountered in defining concepts such as thought, pain, love, or anxiety. Thus, an easy way of defining awareness is the "subjective knowledge of events taking place within and outside ourselves" (Drubach 2000). This subjective knowledge of events can be grouped into two types: phenomenal and non-phenomenal. Phenomenal data is that which is described through the senses, including gustatory, auditory, visual, olfactory, and sensory data. It refers to that which can be "known though the senses, rather than through thought or intuition" (Drubach 2000). Additionally, it includes visceral (the sensation of our bodies and bodily functions) and somatesthetic data (the awareness of our body's position in space). Phenomenal infor- mation can be further divided into extrinsic data (the source of the data lies outside the self) and intrinsic data (the source of the data appears to be generated from within the self). An example of extrinsic data is the awareness of looking at an apple on a table. An example of the intrinsic data is visualizing the same apple with one's eyes closed. Intrinsic phenomenal awareness thus forms the basis for imagination. Nonphenomenal awareness pertains to data that cannot be described through the senses, such as the awareness of our thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and of chronognosis, or the passage of time. After awareness is processed in the brain, information must be interpreted. "Inter- pretation" is a function of perception. Through the process of perception, the object of awareness is assigned meaning and relevance as it applies to the individual. Past experi- ence with the object of awareness is of crucial importance in its correct perception. £} Springer</page><page sequence="3">J Relig Health (2008) 47:541-548 543 Although separated by a fragment of time, awareness and perception are, for practical purposes, almost simultaneous. The brain contains a sophisticated apparatus for the process of awareness, although the mechanisms for phenomenal awareness are better understood than those for nonphenom- enal awareness. It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe the detailed pathways of awareness and perception, but a brief, simplistic review of the visual pathway is helpful in understanding this principle. The visual pathway is responsible for generating visual information, that is to say, information that can be described as having been seen. Consider again the experience of staring at an apple. The light waves defining the physical details of the apple enter the eye and reach specialized cells within the eye. These cells, called receptors, will transduce the light waves into electrochemical impulses. These impulses are carried from the eye to the brain by a number of "pathways," which include the optic nerve and optic radiations. Within the brain, the first destination is the occipital lobes, or more specifically, the primary visual cortex. This is the region where vision and the awareness of visual information take place. Interjected between the source (eyes) and destination (occipital lobes) are a number of structures that act as "gatekeepers." These structures, which include an area called the thalamus, intercept the information from the eyes on its way to the occipital lobe and other ensuing destinations. The end result is that the thalamus "filters" what type and how much of the information it should send to the primary occipital cortex or other areas of the brain. The thalamus does not act on its own accord, but receives instructions from multiple areas, such as the occipital lobe, which it uses to process information. However, the process by which the thalamus "decides" what type and how much of the information is allowed to reach the cortex is far from clear. Once the information from the eyes reaches the primary occipital cortex, it is again processed by literally millions of neurons devoted to vision. Some of the cells process information about vertical lines, others about horizontal lines. Other cells detect movement and still other cells detect colors. As the information is transported within the brain to other areas (including higher order association areas), more details about the perceived object are processed. At the end of the perceptual process, four questions are answered about the object: what is it, what is it called, where it is located in relation to the perceiving individual, and what affective meaning does it contain. To continue with the example of a staring at an apple, the perceptual apparatus will identify a fruit (identification as a par- ticular object), will name it an apple (naming), will locate it within three feet in front and to the right of the person (location), and label it as an object that the individual likes to eat (affective coloring). Thus, perception is the result of millions of neurons working in a perfectly integrated fashion. With few differences, the mechanisms for awareness and perception of all other types of phenomenal information follow a similar pattern. The information is captured by "receptors," which are located in the ear for hearing, the skin for touch, the nose for smell, the tongue for taste, and so on. The receptors translate sound, touch, taste, smell, and vision into electrochemical impulses, which are carried by specific pathways to specialized areas of the brain dedicated to the awareness and processing of the specific type of information. Between the receptor and the brain there are again "gatekeepers," mostly localized in the thalamus. The thalamus acts as a gatekeeper selecting and limiting the information carried to the cortex and in turn receiving appropriate instructions from all areas of the brain. This process of phenomenal perception both simultaneously facilitates yet also confines environmental awareness. Awareness of the five modalities of external information, vision, £) Springer</page><page sequence="4">544 J Relig Health (2008) 47:541-548 touch, hearing, olfaction, and taste, is bound by three major limits intrinsic to neuronal processing. First, the brain is able to process only the phenomenal information inherent to the neural network. From an external phenomenal perspective, if there were other modalities of information outside of these five modalities, we could not become aware of them because we have neither the receptors nor the brain pathways that enable us to process them. Take, for example, a hypothetical population of people without eyes or a visual cortex living on a desert island. To the inhabitants of the island, vision does not exist. If an individual with the ability of sight came to the island and tried to explain sight to the inhabitants, the explanation would be met by confusion and disbelief. Secondly, perception cannot be immediate. In the case of the visual phenomenon, there is a brief amount of time elapsed from the moment information reaches the eye receptors to the moment we become aware of it, which means that we are precluded from being aware of the immediate present. The process of receptors transforming light information into electrochemical responses, the transportation of the information to the thalamus, the processing time by the thalamus, and the transportation to the cortex where awareness takes place happen in a split second, yet is not an immediate process. Therefore, we are always aware of information which happened a short time ago, and consequently, of the past. This is analogous to looking at a star. The light seen from the star actually left the stars hundreds or thousands of years ago, since due to the speed of light, it took that amount of time for it to reach the earth. Finally, and most pertinent to our discussion, we cannot perceive unchanging data. The brain needs a changing, or novel, stimulus rather than a static or unchanging stimulus in order to process that stimulus. Take, for example, the visual field of the humans. If a person looks straight ahead, the lower middle portion of the visual field, corresponding to the location of the nose is not seen. That is because the light signals from the nose are unchanging in relation to the eyes. If nose is moved by that individual, it becomes readily visible. This process, called habituation, is the manner by which the brain "cancels out" stimulus that are persistent and unchanging. Habituation takes place for every modality of information. Neuronal Habituation Recent years have witnessed increasing understanding of the underlying neurological mechanisms for the process of habituation. One of the earliest models for the study of this phenomenon was performed on an organism termed Aplysia, a marine mollusk with a relatively simple nervous system and relatively simple patterns of behavior. The Aplysia normally withdraws its gills when stimulated with a brief jet of seawater. The jet of seawater stimulates a receptor in the skin of the organism. The receptor translates this mechanical into chemical impulses which are carried to a "sensory" cell. This sensory cell stimulates a motor cell which causes the muscle in the gill to contract. Repeated stimu- lation with the jet of seawater, however, leads to habituation, such that the gills are no longer withdrawn. A large number of research studies have clarified the biological sub- strate for this change in behavior (Cohen et al. 1997) (Hawkins et al. 1998). These studies have discovered that repeated stimulation of the gills by brief jets of seawater causes a change in the structure and function of the sensory cell, so that it decreases its stimulation upon the motor cells (which controls the muscles responsible for withdrawal). The behavioral change (decreased withdrawal of the gills in response to the jet of seawater) is a consequence of a structural change in the nervous system. £} Springer</page><page sequence="5">J Relig Health (2008) 47:541-548 545 The human brain is of course more complicated than the nervous system of the Aplysia, but the process of habituation follows a similar pattern. The brain responds to novel stimulation and quickly adapts to stimuli which are constant and unchanging, thus "can- celling out" the awareness of these stimuli. This has been shown utilizing extremely sophisticated techniques for every modality including vision (Fischer et al. 2000), hearing (Romero and Polich 1996), touch, temperature sensation (Becerra et al. 1999), and others (Haenschel et al. 2000; Hirano et al. 1996; Rajah et al. 1998). The physiology for habit- uation is extremely complex and a number of publications in recent years have better delineated its mechanism, but it is clear that habituation can bring about prominent changes in the molecular structure and function of neurons (Quinlan et al. 1999). Habituation, as described above, is clearly a short-term process. Again, consider the example of the sight of one's nose in the inferior midline of vision. Eyes are constantly changing positions, and interpreting new stimuli; therefore, one can periodically recognize the shadow of the nose, or the outline of a nasal bridge. This holds true for all that we encounter in our daily life. Even if the characteristics of an object in relation to the eyes were to remain constant, changes in light, the position of our eyes, or a multitude of other extraneous factors would change and abolish habituation. However, suppose there exists an object so perfectly unchanging that it would not be modified by any of the variables mentioned above - eye movement, light reflections, or any other factor. It follows that one would be "blind" to that object, no matter how near or far that object is from the visual field. In fact, the intensity of its presence would be the key to our perceived absence of that object. And that, we submit, is the resolution of the apparent conflict between God's presence and our perceived absence of Him. God's presence must be so perfect and immutable, "infinite, eternal, and unchangeable (Boyd 1856)" that we are not aware of It. The existence of God could be invisible to us due to an inherent limit of our neuronal perceptual ability. If God's presence were permanently unchanging, then the human neural networks of perception would habituate to it and not be able to become aware of It. Self-disclosure of God: The Example at Mount Sinai While this may explain the present state of affairs with regard to the awareness of God's presence by humans, the Jewish and Christian accounts of God's external self-disclosure reinforce the unusual aspects of these encounters. Ultimately, God uses various sensory modalities to communicate with humans. These events are known as theophanies. In one account, a dramatic event is described at Mount Sinai when Moses "brought the people out of the camp to meet God" (Exodus 19:17). A meeting is only possible if the participants are "aware" of each other's presence. But what type of awareness, according to our classification above, did the Jews have of God? God tells Moses "Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever" (Exodus 19:9). Additionally, He tells Moses that He will "come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people" (Exodus 19:1 1). Both of these references to sight and hearing are, as we have discussed above, forms of phenomenal awareness. Another version of the God's revelation at Sinai, which makes reference to auditory awareness, can be found in the Talmud, where it reads "At Sinai, when the Holy One gave the Torah to Israel, He manifested marvels upon marvels for Israel with His voice... As the Holy One spoke, the voice reverberated throughout the world... all the people perceived the £} Springer</page><page sequence="6">546 J Relig Health (2008) 47:541-548 thunderings" (Exodus 20:15). The 11th century philosopher Moses Maimonides com- ments, "The children of Israel were brought close to Mount Sinai and personally saw and heard the Revelation with their own eyes and ears... Our ancestors have testified that they all personally witnessed the Giving of the Torah through their own senses and knew it to be true without question" (Maimonides 8:1). Human Awareness of God and Individual Perception If God is immutable, then the "degree of his presence" is also unchanging. Therefore, in order for humans to become aware of God, our capacity of awareness and potential for habituation must somehow be modified to detect God's presence. In the case of God's revelation at Mount Sinai, was this change in human awareness at the will of the Israelites, or was it extrinsically caused by God's intervention? There are many accounts in Jewish and Christian religious writings when God inter- venes, and human awareness is enhanced, or a person's eyes are opened. Such is the case of Hagar, when God "opened her eyes" (Genesis 21 : 19) for her to see the well of water. Also, "God gave Balaam the ability to see and he perceived the angel standing in the road" (Numbers 22:31). Steven, considered the first martyr of the Christian faith, was given the ability to see the glory of God. "But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God" (Acts 7:55-56). It is clearly within the Jewish and Christian traditions for God temporarily to change human awareness. When considering the event at Mount Sinai one questions whether the "quality of awareness" of each individual. As we have discussed above, awareness is an experiential phenomenon that can only be experienced in the first person. In the case of vision, an individual knows what is seen, but is precluded from seeing what another person sees, even if looking at the same object. We are therefore barred from knowing the content of somebody else's awareness, much as we are barred from knowing the content of another person's dreams. Thus, for each Jew at Sinai, awareness was known only by each indi- vidual, but collectively the Jews could share. This concept of individualized perception is expressed as the Talmud's account of the people's perception of God's voice at Sinai. Thus it reads: "Come and see how the voice went forth to all of Israel, to each and every one in keeping with his particular capacity-to the elderly in keeping with their capacity, to young men in keeping with their capacity, to the little ones in keeping with their capacity, and to women in keeping with their capacity" (Exodus Rabba 5:9). God's voice filled the need of every single individual Jew. It was not a "generic" voice directed to all; it was individualized to the requirements of each single person, a product of the interaction between God's voice and the person hearing It. The physiologic basis for individuality of awareness is based on the brain's ability to recognize external stimuli. The brain is not a mirror reflecting external reality. While placing an apple in front of 10 mirrors will yield 10 identical reflected images, placing the same apple in front of 10 individuals will yield 10 different interpretations of the apple. Every person has an individualized perception of reality. When a person becomes aware, this process is a product of the interaction between the source of the information and the brain cells dedicated to awareness. Consider this analogy. Suppose a chemist places a drop of the same dye into several beakers containing dyes of different colors. On contact with the drop, each beaker will take on a different color despite the fact that the same dye was placed into each of them. The final color results from the interaction between the dye in the beaker and the dye in the £} Springer</page><page sequence="7">J Relig Health (2008) 47:541-548 547 drop. So it is with awareness. A perceived reality emerges from the interaction between the object of awareness and the individual, including the preceding history the individual has with that object. Perception is a dynamic process. It is constantly being modified according to ongoing experience with the object of awareness. Utilizing the previous analogy, a person can modify the content of the dye in the beaker so that when the drop is placed in it, a more beautiful color can result. The fact that we can enrich the quality of our perceptions by means of measures such as acquisition of experiences or learning is one of the most wonderful of human abilities. Because of the process of perception, it could be argued that all awareness is subjective, depending on the person's past experience with the object of awareness. Thus, the Talmud tells us that when God provided the Jews with manna in the desert, the manna tasted differently to each Jew, according to their needs and wants. Manna is described in Scripture as "bread," as "honey," and as "oil" (Exodus Rabba 5:9). If we habituate to God's presence, are we precluded from ever becoming aware of Him? Christ claimed "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father" (John 14:9), suggesting that his life was a grand theophany. This is contrasted with God's statement "you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live" (Exodus 33:20). Will humans continue to seek out a presence that we cannot perceive due to these intrinsic insurmountable limitations? Or is it possible for man to execute some modification in the self that can enable him to "overcome" habituation and become aware of God? While habituation prevents our ability to perceive God, it may provide other benefits, namely, the ability of choice. If humans perceived the presence of God constantly, then it seems to reason that we would be burdened by it and lose all freedom of choice. Recent studies in neurophysiology have demonstrated that it is possible to sharpen or improve the efficiency of the awareness apparatus and thus enhance our perception of reality. This inherent ability of the brain to reorganize itself so as to increase the perceptual range has been denominated perceptual plasticity. This concept has been well demon- strated in musicians. Early musical training leads to an expansion in the brain areas involved in the procession of complex harmonic sounds (Pantev and Lutkenhoner 2000), which enables musicians to be better able to detect and process various aspects of music than non-musicians (Burns and Houtsma, 1999). Consequently, the musician experiences a different reality when listening to a musical piece than the non-musician. Whether humans can bring about modifications to perceptual abilities and enhance the perception of God is a fundamental question that merits further exploration. References Becerra, L.
