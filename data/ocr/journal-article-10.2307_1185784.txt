<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS IN THE STUDY OF NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN RELIGIONS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE HOPIS BY ARMIN W. GEERTZ In my study of Hopi prophecies about the end of the world (Geertz 1992b), I documented the widespread interest in Hopi prophecy and culture by Europeans and Americans. Their prophetic message about the return of a long-awaited White Brother has moved many groups and individuals to travel to the reservation, engage in cultural collision and sometimes cultural collusion, and return home to carry on personal crusades. These crusades generally thrive on the production and proliferation of stereotypes about Native peoples, and they have more often than not indirectly and sometimes directly caused harm on the reservation and off. Such behavior reflects an age-old European phenomenon called "primitivism," which has its roots in antiquity. Arthur Lovejoy and George Boas (1935) have shown that primitivism is the philosophical position that associates the best existence either in the beginnings of time or in "nature." Thus primitivism is part of the more encompassing idea that "nature" somehow constitutes the norm for human existence. There are two types of primitivism: 1) chronological primitivism, which locates the best human condition in terms of time, namely, primordial times, and 2) cultural primitivism, which locates the best human condition in contemporary "primitive" cultures, especially because of their perceived relationship to "nature" or their "natural" way of living. The first type can neither be proven nor disproven, but the second type can be shown to be the product of centuries of misrepresentation. In The Invention of Prophecy I described European and American individuals and groups who more or less adopt Hopi ideology as their own and play out fantasies in the framework of Hopi mythology. I presented a typology consisting of the following: Under explicit identification, I noted the man who thought he had the missing corner of the ancient stone tablet of Hopi legend, the Chinese.Buddhist priest who thought he was the long- awaited apocryphal White Brother; the Flying Saucer prophet who believed that the White Brother consisted of beings from Venus and that he was their prophet; the Jungian doctoral student who thought C. G. Jung was the awaited White Brother; and so on. Some thought they were the White Brother, and others, like Mrs. ARMIN W GEER7Z ISA PROFESSOR OF RELIGIOUs STUDIESAT THE UNIVERSITY AARHus, DENMARK.

Irving Hallowell (1963) called this phenomenon "transculturalization," whereby individuals temporarily or permanently leave one culture and enter into the web of social relations in another culture. The category symbolization involves individuals and groups who use the Hopis as a symbol of or focus for their own particular ideology. The best example is the Flagstaff- and California-based umbrella organization Friends of the Hopi whose activism was prominent in the late 1970s. This type of support rests not only on stereotypes of the Hopis but also on stereotypes of our own culture. Gerald Sider (1987) and others saw it as another type of domination in which Europeans parrot their own fantasies of the Other. Eclecticism/creative syncretism involves individuals and groups who construct worldviews out of the bits and pieces of other worldviews. One of the more intriguing examples is the German fellow who thought he simultaneously was Jesus and a reincarnated Hopi prophet. Activism concerns people who for one reason or another (usually one or more of the above) actively support the Hostile or Traditionalist campaigns. Here we find Mrs. Gates, Friends of the Hopi, action anthropolo- gist Richard Clemmer, activist Craig Carpenter, and others. I quoted one vociferous Hopi response to (what Hopis consider them to be as) ignorant "do-gooders" (see also Geertz 1987). Tourism/bobbyism involves people who come to the reservation as tourists or who imitate Indian life and customs as a hobby. Tourism has been a problem since the laying of the railroad lines, and the Hopis have made serious efforts to remain friendly while protecting their ethnic integrity. Hobbyism, on the other hand, is a more difficult problem. Hobbyism has a long history. Some consider it to be useful in promoting understanding and preserving Indian culture. Others (Native American activists most promi- nently), however, denounce it as imbecilic, sacrilegious and cultural genocide. It demonstrates, at least, the fulfillment and actualization of stereotypes. The Hopis spent years trying to cope with and stop a group of Prescott businessmen who call themselves Smokis, and who dress, dance, and propagate thinly disguised versions of Hopi religion in order to preserve "the ancient ceremonial rites of a vanishing race." The tribe seems to have succeeded in stopping their activities. Whatever their motivations, Europeans and Americans have been a constant source of irritation which in many cases has led to serious action on the part of the Hopis. One of the more dominant interest groups of the 1980s and 1990s is New Agers. New Age grew out of a long tradition of occult, oriental, and spiritualistic movements in interaction with recurrent revival- isms in the United States. The New Age is many things and, yet, it is perceived by its exponents as expressing a holistic worldview. It is openly eclectic and apocryphal, and it is characterized by a search for universal meaning that transcends the limitations of any particular culture, religion, or political 394 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VoL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="3">ARMIN GEERTZ system.' I argue that its disregard for cultural uniqueness represents a meaning hegemony or "spiritual imperialism."2 This new form of imperialism brought on reactions from various minority, ethnic, and tribal groups. Native Americans play a decisive role as symbols in New Age ideas and rhetoric, but Native Americans themselves play a role only in as much as they conform to New Age market stereotypes. Some Native Americans, like Wendy Rose (1984), claim that the New Agers, healers, White Shamans, etc. are as arrogant, ignorant, and presumptuous as early pioneers and hobbyists were. But other Native Americans have found a meaningful niche as "New Native Shamans," "Medicine Men," and "Proph- ets." A disproportionately large percentage of these were the leaders and spokesmen of the Hopi Traditionalist Movement which actively developed and proliferated aprocryphal dialogue in relation to European and American interest groups since the movement was established at the end of the 1940s. One of the most successful and dramatic New Age events of the 1980s was the "Harmonic Convergence" on August 16-17, 1987. This event consisted of a global "happening" in which thousands of people gathered at various "sacred centers" to conduct rituals meant to ease the planet into a transition phase to the New Age. The man who conceived the event, Jose Argfielles (1987), promulgated a sensationalized misrepresentation of Hopi prophecy with a little help from Hopi traditionalist spokesman Thomas Banancya. About 50 non-Hopis met with Banancya at Prophecy Rock for two weeks until the Hopi Police Department was sent out to disperse them.3 One New Ager, Thomas E. Mails, had an ongoing conflict during the early 1990s with the Hopi Tribe. On an August day 1993, a white woman dropped offa "prayerstick offering" at the Second Mesa village of Shungopavi. She had made the offering by following instructions in Mails' 1988 book Sacred Native American Pathways. The woman wanted her offering to be deposited with the Hopi offerings during the upcoming Snake Ceremonial. The woman's action was doubly offensive to the Hopis. In the first place, only properly initiated people are allowed to make prayer offerings, and, in the second place, only men have that privilege. The Hopi Tribe's Cultural Preservation Office already had protested Mail's workshops earlier that year, but went on the offensive together with the White Mountain Apaches and the Zunis against a workshop on Indian rituals planned for September. They were indignant about Mails' disrespect for their culture as well as his commercialization of sacred objects and practices. But Mails claimed that the Cultural Preservation Office was playing dirty politics and that he had the support ofHopi elders such as Thomas Banancya. And he stated belligerently that the Hopis do not have a patent on the Great Spirit.4 The examples of cultural collision are too numerous to mention here. The important thing to note is that New Agers are not trying to be offensive. They act according to their religious convictions, however insensitive their actions may seem, and they are particularly attracted to one AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VOL. 20(3) 395</page><page sequence="4">CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS small segment of the Hopi population, namely, the Traditionalist Movement and its current spokesman Thomas Banancya.s Many New Agers nourish grandiose ideas about themselves and their "destiny" in relation to the Hopis, but, as meaningless as it seems to Hopis and others, it is saturated with meaning for New Agers. The trouble is that the pursuit of meaning can and does lead to the distorted representation of other peoples' worldviews and sometimes to the presumptuous misuse of their meaning systems as well as their hospitality. Sociologist Robert Bellah (1976) saw the developments of the 1960s and 1970s as a "crisis of meaning." How the crisis came about is still debated among scholars, but I think that New Age is a persistent attempt to reconstruct a cohesive and viable worldview, an attempted reconstruction of meaning. But why does such a reconstructed, "liberated" worldview need, or at least empirically has had, to misrepresent other worldviews? If we distinguish between meaning systems as associated with particular symbols or sets of symbols, on the one hand, and worldviews as all beliefs held about the nature of reality, on the other,6 we can speak of individuals and groups with widely different worldviews who can, nevertheless, share meaning systems in part or in whole. The problem is when people confuse shared meaning systems with disparate worldviews.7 For analytical purposes, I define the situation as consisting of three basic worldviews: 1) the worldview of traditional Hopis in the twentieth century, 2) the worldview of the Traditionalist Hopis in the New Age, and 3) the worldview of the New Age in "dialogue" with Native Americans. This is an admitted simplification, but it reflects and explains the jumble of data at hand. The above-mentioned three worldviews may share meaning systems, but they do not share a worldview. They are interconnected in a vast network of meaning systems, but each has its own goals and its own mission: Traditional Hopis are trying to adapt to the conditions of the twentieth century; Traditionalists are trying to fight their opponents on the Tribal Council with the help of outsiders; and the proponents of the New Age are trying to revolutionize the world. Each combines what Berger and Luckmann (1966, 102ff.) called "sub-universes of meaning": the traditional Hopis combine traditional Hopi premises with American premises, the Traditionalists combine politicized Hopi premises with New Age premises, and New Age combines politicized American premises with Eastern religions and Native American premises. Each group has its own millennial expectations, many of which are mutually exclusive. But explaining the situation analytically does not excuse it morally, and the above-mentioned examples have contributed to a clear and aggressive hostility shown by the Hopis to Europeans and Americans today. This hostility has had serious consequences also for scholars of Hopi culture and 396 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VOL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="5">ARMIN GEERTZ religion, to which I will return. I concluded in my study of Hopi prophecy that much of our wonder about the apparent contradictions stems from antiquated conceptions about Native peoples and their religions that our culture and science hold. We forget that religion, tradition, prophecy, and so on, are ways of thinking, speaking, and acting by humans situated in intricate webs of significance (to borrow Clifford Geertz's phrase). And we students of indigenous cultures are caught in the middle of intricate webs of ethics and meaning sometimes, but mostly not, of our own choosing. PRIMITIVISM AND RELIGIOUS STUDIES Even though primitivism is a phenomenon persuasive in popular culture, it is also a regrettable fact that some of its most eloquent proliferators are professional scholars. And in this capacity, students of religion unfortunately have made major contributions. One of the main causes of this is the fact that not many students of religion actually do fieldwork, and many of those who do, do it poorly. The notorious lack of communication between anthropologists and students of religion, especially in the United States, perhaps less so in Europe, may be due to the naivety of techniques used by religious studies. Any student of religion doing work in Eastern religions without knowledge of Sanskrit, Chinese, or Japanese would not be taken seriously. Not so, the student of "indigenous" religions. In Hopi studies, those who do not learn the language inevitably succomb to Benjamin Lee Whorfs beguiling theories about the Hopi language (cf. Carroll 1956). Whorfs theories on Hopi nouns, verbs, space, and time, however, are neither based on nor proven by empirical data, that is, by illustrative texts in situ. In fact there is such an overwhelming volume of data disproving Whorfs ideas about the Hopi language that it is inexplicable that scholars still take them seriously.8 Those who engage in little or no fieldwork rely too heavily on secondary sources and have little possibility to judge the quality of those sources. A combination of an ignorance of the language and of the people usually leads to an inexplicable dependance on popularists such as Frank Waters (1963).9 The second main cause of primitivism in religious studies is the uncritical application of global theories such as Eliade's ideas about history or modern popular postulates about gender, nature, or some other topic that is thought to express the "true essence" of indigenous philosophies. This concatenation of causes and effects leads to end products in Hopi studies that are at least five times removed from Hopi reality, but which, let it be noted, are read by a lot of people. Thus, one finds a doctoral dissertation by Judith Todd, submitted to the University of California in Santa Cruz, that purported to prove the viability of "the Hopi environmental ethos" as a AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VOL. 20(3) 397</page><page sequence="6">CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS model for the "Deep Ecology Movement" (Todd 1986). In it, we find a regurgitation of Whorfs theories and a number of astounding assertions about Hopi cognition. Recent work by two American students of religion, William Quinn Jr. (1983) and John Loftin (1986, 1991) make the same kind of mistakes, only in this case, the fantasies of Whorf are combined with those of Eliade. A closer analysis of John D. Loftin's book Religion and Hopi Life in the Twentieth Century (1991) will illustrate my point.10 Loftin was a lawyer and taught in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. His book is partly based on a doctoral dissertation written in 1983 and on six summers of field work among the Hopis. The author claims that no comprehensive and systematic interpretation of Hopi religion exists in the literature. This lack stems in part, according to Loftin, from the fact "that the Hopi have been investigated mostly by anthropolo- gists, who have tended to interpret the Hopi religious orientation as it relates to social structure and material culture" (xiv). But a comprehensive and systematic interpretation of Hopi religion does exist-and it is written by an anthropologist. Loftin knows Richard M. Bradfield's work,A NaturalHistory ofAssociations (London 1973), since he refers to it often in his book. Loftin's claim is peculiar to religious studies at Chicago. Mircea Eliade was of the opinion that religion cannot be adequately interpreted through what he considered to be the reductionisms of the social sciences. Religion must be studied with the help of a special transhistorical empathy that only historians of religions are capable of experiencing, and the results of which must contribute to a type of humanistic revivalism Eliade believed is essential to the salvation of modern humanity from its existential malaise. This position is evidenced in a large number of studies inspired by or directly.influenced by Eliade and his closest pupils. ARCHAIC ONTOLOGY How do Eliadeans study religion? They proceed from a series of a priori assumptions of which two are particularly essential. The first is the concept of the dialectics of the sacred, and the second is the idea of the terror of history. To be human is to be religious. Homo sapiens is Homo religiosus. Religious humans live their lives in terms of transcendent exemplary models, where the inevitable tension between the historicization of the sacred and the remythization of the historical are played out in many, mostly dramatic, forms. Eliade conceived of these factors in reified terms. For him, the sacred is a "metacultural and transhistorical" phenomenon coextensive with human nature, and, therefore, not all religious experience is historically determined. Thus, "essential religious structures" cannot be demonstrated as having been created by certain societies at certainhistorical moments. These societies have 398 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VOL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="7">ARMIN GEERTZ simply provided the opportunity for the manifestation of forms of the sacred. Eliade's well-known morphology of the sacred provides categories for studying these manifestations. Eliade was aware of the historical nature of the documents, but he never resorted to explaining the specific historical and social factors of the dialectic because he was more interested in delineating the nature of the nonhistorical structures than in explaining their historical manifestations. Thus, as anthropologist John Saliba (1976, 140) pointed out, Eliade's model is a "descending model" which deletes the human dimension of religion. He does not study religion in order to study mankind, but rather in order to study the sacred. Eliade has often been criticized for his normative stance, his diffuse (some call it confusionistic) argumentation, poor docu- mentation, and anti-historical approach as well as his own particular misuse of various terms. As inspiring and religious as his approach is, I consider it to be more reductionistic and less enlightening than even the most mathematical questionnaire sociology. I will return to the second main assumption shortly. But first, it is necessary to explain where Loftin fits into the picture. Loftin's book on Hopi religion is a study in Eliadean theology, or "archaic ontology," if you will. He claims he has deciphered the "various modes of religious experience and expression" of the Hopis. He never defines what he means by "modes," but it is clear that he is motivated by a morphology of the sacred in Eliade's sense. His book seems on the surface to be a serious study: he uses a whole list of Hopi terms and even cites a sentence in Hopi here and there; he refers to field experience, quotes consultants, cites earlier literature, and produces arguments for his position. But a closer look at the substance of the study shows serious weaknesses. His ignorance of the language is a major handicap, and he jumps to enormous theological conclusions based on curiously literalistic interpreta- tions of little understood terms. His field experience has little to do with the substance of the book, and his use of the literature is without evaluation. Finally, following Eliade, Loftin's style of argument is tautological and spiced with paradox and metaphor. For instance: "Myth incorporates history into timelessness by forgetting the distinctive characteristics of events, while prophecy remembers the timeless dimension of events that are at first glance irreversible and historical" (xx), or, "The Hopi emerged in the beginning as clowns, and a sacred, atemporal dimension surrounds their very finitude and mortality" (xxi), or, the four fundamental activities of the hunting-gathering ancestors "relate to active decipherments of cosmic rhythms, though the activities related to them paradoxically point back to their passive, ultimate character" (23). It is as if the type of writing which Eliade introduced to his readers constitutes for his students a sacred and hierosophical language of its own to be emulated and developed. It does not, however, add precision to the analysis of religions. I would think that using Eliade's approach and categories should at least occasion an acknowledgment AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VoL. 20(3) 399</page><page sequence="8">CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS of, or discussion with, the still-growing literature of criticism of the great master. The end result is that Loftin makes various claims in the first half of the book about Hopi religious experience, about Hopi mythical thought, about the concept of the sacred without any evidence, not one cited myth, not one argument supported by testable evidence. Instead, we are offered a eulogy of repetitive assertions, and, in the process, he commits overinterpretation every step of the way. He has, like many others before him, romanticized the Hopis, and he gives the impression that Hopis are enwrapped in a collective state of mystical consciousness with no capacity for skepticism, individu- alism, criticism, doubt, or rationality. His stance even moves him to tender grossly insulting remarks like, "The Hopi are aware, then, that plants need water" (10). Loftin's point of departure is that "the sacred" is the underlying and interconnecting phenomena of Hopi experience. He claims that the term for the sacred is a'ni himu, which he translates as "Mighty Something". He also asserts that the sacred is "basic reality." Furthermore, he claims that the indefiniteness of the term is due to the fact that Hopi religious experience is a confrontation with "something" mysterious and incomprehensible and is thus "not unlike William James's 'something there' or Rudolf Otto's 'numinous"' (xv-xvi). This peculiar literalism has nothing to do with the Hopi language, and it does not warrant Loftin's theological speculations about how and what the Hopis experience. Loftin is trapped by his own quest for the exotic. The first problem is that these terms in combination are not very common and can hardly justify being treated as a type of generic term for "significant practical, social, and perceptual activities" (xv). The second problem is that Loftin never proves that they also translate as "basic reality" or even as its euphemism. The third problem is that where Loftin essentializes them as one term, they are in fact two terms that cover an array of semantic categories that do not necessarily point in the direction he claims. The term a'ni is an intensifying adverbial meaning "a lot/a great deal," and himu is an indefinite pronoun which can refer to animate or inanimate objects without distinction of gender, and it translates as "someone or something."" Linguist Ekkehart Malotki in his book Hopi Time illustrated various uses of the term a'ni, and I have chosen two examples of the a'ni himu combination (hiitu in sentence 2 is the accusative form): Sentence 1: Itaa-sipal-tsoki a'ni himui-y'-ta Our-peach-tree a lot something [POSS-IMPRF] Our peach tree is bearing a lot [of fruit]. Sentence 2: Pay hapi nu' uu-ngaqw a'ni hiita tuwi-y'-va 400 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VoL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="9">ARMIN GEERTZ Well [EMPH] I you-from a lot something [ACC] knowledge [POSS-INCHO] I've really learned a great deal from you (1983, 221-222). Here we find the combination bearing nothing more than quantification. The last sentence, for instance, does not indicate "sacred knowledge," rather a great deal of knowledge. This is a clear example of the search for the exotic. Our problem is not only the banality of finding things that are not there, but even more importantly, from a science of religion perspective, it is the construction and representation of other cultures. Historians of religions are traffickers in exotica. We look for it and thrive on it. It satisfies us, gives us our identity, and secures jobs for us. It is simultaneously our strength and our weakness. The strength lies in fairly exact knowledge about exotic languages and cultures. The weakness lies in the tendency to overread or overinterpret exotica in our data, be they texts, oral transcriptions, or simple behavioral descriptions. Our partners in exotica, ethnographers and social anthropo- logists, have the same problem.12 In my collection of texts edited together with Michael Loma- tuway'ma (1987), the combination a'ni himu is found eight times in 100 pages of Hopi texts. Five of the examples refer to powerful beings or qualities, two to quantification, and one to relative status. The first five all refer to powerful animate beings and not to a "sacred something."13 Which brings me to my last example. Malotki published a short text in Hopi that explains what the terms can signify when describing the supernatural: A being may have greater than human powers for a variety of reasons. Sometimes these powers are rooted in evil. Other times, exceptional powers may be based on the ability to achieve great things. The kachinas are extremely powerful beings in this sense, because they know how to produce rain. All those who exist invisibly and aid the Hopi with their knowledge are considered beings of superhuman strength. Many of them, such as the Old Spider Woman and her grandsons, P6qangwhoya and Pal6ngawhoya, Pavayoykyasi, Maasaw, and the Sun god appear in many myths and tales and perform many feats. Since the Hopi cannot perform these feats, they constantly plead to these beings to support them in their lives, each being using its own special methods (Malotki &amp; Lomatuway'ma, 1987, 281).14 This text clearly shows that we are dealing with power in terms of clearly defined and named beings who are simply more powerful than humans. We are, in other words, neither dealing with the sacred nor with ultimate reality nor with some ineffable numinosity. In fact, these English terms don't AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VoL. 20(3) 401</page><page sequence="10">CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS seem to apply in actual Hopi usage. Other terms that tend towards Loftin's premise, such as himu antsa, "sacred thing," and pas himu, "it is sacred," are again combinations of intensifiers modifying the indefinite pronoun. Loftin's correlative jump into talking about "sacred substances" is equally unwarranted.15 Loftin continues his theological speculations by claiming that "the sacred" also is called "giver of the breath of life" or "he who walks unseen" (14). In the first place, there is no direct evidence of such a connection, and, in the second place, he is illicitly equating the inanimate with the animate. He furthermore misreads Malotki when claiming that Maasaw has taken over the roles of an earlier Supreme Being. There is no evidence of an earlier Supreme Being. Maasaw's development into a supreme being can be shown, on the other hand, to have arisen in contact with pan-Indian and Euroamer- ican usage of the Lakota "Great Spirit," which crept into the Hopi Tradition- alist Movement rhetoric during the mid-1950s. Loftin also quotes my note on similar euphemisms,16 but I think it is clear in that note that the terms are referring to new developments in Hopi theology-if that is what it can be called. There are so few Hopis who refer to a Supreme Being, that the evidence can hardly warrant Loftin's encompassing claims. Loftin goes on to claim that "all Hopi deities should be understood as so many refractions ofa'ni himu, and he concludes (15) that "the Hopi are not polytheistic; rather they worship one spiritual substance that manifests itself in many modes of being." This claim is so absurd that I wonder whether Loftin has read the hundreds of pages of myths describing Hopi gods. Their world is much along the same lines as that of the Greek gods: mostly anthropomorphic, assisting and/or pestering or tormenting humans and each other on matters of sex, power, and fertility. It is difficult, if not impossible, to find Loftin's "refractions." Finally, Loftin attempts to explain the bewildering array of contradictory mythical evidence in Hopi religion (cf. 42-43) by concluding that "people such as the Hopi, for whom mythic modes of understanding are dominant, often see relation, where more historically oriented people see difference" (131). Loftin suggests that there is a vague kind of logic behind the paradoxes which "handles them rather easily," but his main error here is that he refuses to tender any historical or social explanation. He fails to consider factors such as mutually incompatible clan traditions promoted by competing migrants from various regions, deliberate conspiracies (which was Whiteley's important thesis in his DeliberateActs), varying degrees ofmisinforma- tion, historical contingencies, and the highly unequal quality of the recorders of the myths. Loftin reads Nequatewa from 2nd mesa, Stephen at 1st mesa, Voth at 3rd mesa, while at the same time drawing on materials and ideas from highly questionable sources such as Matthews, Courlander, and O'Kane. It is then claimed that the Hopis don't perceive all of the inconsistencies, 402 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VoL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="11">ARMIN GEERTZ paradoxes, and loose ends of the resultant hodgepodge. It's only impoverished "historically" oriented Westerners who get stuck here. Well, there are inconsistencies (even if one ignores the errors of the scholars), and they are mostly due to human beings with conflicting allegiances in historically contingent situations. They are due to human beings who struggle every day to negotiate their identity and reality. The Hopis are clearly aware of the many inconsistencies and paradoxes, and they devote inordinate amounts of energy and time in arguing about them, rationalizing them, systematizing them, and explaining them away. Just as we do. But the romantizations so important in primitivist thinking cannot thrive in this more human point of view. In Children of Cottonwood I devote a chapter to how the village was divided between bickering groups during a ceremonial (which is the occasion where harmony is supposed to prevail) precisely because of differences in clan tradition. My article on Hopi hermeneutics provides a further analysis of the conflict (1990a). Despite Loftin's arguments that the Hopi clan and phratry system supposedly afford the "experience of transcendence" to "spheres of unity and spirituality" (17-18), they are actually a major source of the rivalries, hatreds, and discontinuities of Hopi life. The clan and phratry systems are hegemonic and the currency of social power is the possession of esoteric knowledge. They are built on a series of Chinese boxes of privileged clans, privileged lineages, and privileged people. In addition to all of this, the secret fraternities and sororities add their own kind of rivalries as well. In my book on Hopi prophecy, I argue the obvious that to be human is to be historically contingent. Homo religiosus is a figment, a dream to catch hold of and sometimes grasp in the midst of more basic concerns. Holding his head high in the mists of "spiritual substances," Loftin lost sight of the way humans live their lives. ARCHAIC HISTORY The second main Eliadean assumption is the theory of history which Eliade laid out in his book Le Mythe de l'iternel retour (1949, rev. 1965). His thesis was that "archaic" peoples (a concept Eliade never defined) demonstrate a deliberate interest in a periodical return to the mythical time of the beginning of things, to the "Great Time." For Eliade, this nostalgia constitutes nothing less than the rejection of autonomous, linear history, a rejection that he called the "terror of history" (1965, 139ff). The archaic history is a "sacred history" that can be repeated indefinitely "in the sense that the myths serve as models for ceremonies that periodically reactualize the tremendous events that occurred at the beginning of time. The myths preserve and transmit the paradigms, the exemplary models, for all the responsible activities in which men engage" (1965, xiv). There are two problems with Eliade's argument. In the first place, AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/Vol. 20(3) 403</page><page sequence="12">CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS there is no reason to assume, as he did, that cyclic and linear concepts of time are necessarily contradictory and incompatible. The Hopi evidence shows that myth and ritual often are vehicles that unite the two. Secondly, even if we accept that sacred history in Eliade's sense exists among various peoples, we are neither obliged to assign that historical conception absolute ontological value nor to restrict the mythical imagination to paradigmatic statements about the past. Like Eliade, Loftin claims "that the return to the primordium is inseparably intertwined with the Hopi's concern for rain, crops, and health" (134, note 70), and this activity occurs in sacred as well as more mundane contexts. But Loftin's attempt to see the re-creation of the world every time a Hopi farmer farms or every time a Hopi happens to remember that he or she is a member of a clan (xviii) verges on the incredible. Following the lead of Walter O'Kane, whom Loftin inexplicably promotes as a serious scholar, he makes the claim that "the Hopi do not understand work as a secular activity that is somehow distinct from their religious life" (3). When Hopis weave cotton, "they are also experiencing the sacred" (3). "Hopi farming techniques, along with hunting, gathering, building, eating, and sexual activity, are among the most religiously significant activities performed by Hopis" (5).7" He claims that weaving "recalls the emergence of the Hopi," and this recollection actually regenerates the world (4). These are startling claims. It is claims like these that reinforce popular primitivism and that have made the Hopis objects of worship for tourists, New Agers, artists, and activists. My question is a more academic one: Do the Hopis experience the sacred while working in various tribal administrative offices or in running the local supermarket or in producing silver overlay or when collecting wood, brushing their teeth, washing their windows, filling watercans, using the latrine, etc.? If Loftin is forced to admit no to just one of these things, he would need a whole interpretive apparatus for distinguishing when it is work and when it is sacred. If he says yes to them all, then the burden of the proof is his. Just because one weaves by techniques laid down by Spider Woman does not necessarily mean that the Hopis "experience the sacred" every time they weave. They weave because they were taught to do it that way. If an uncle wants to spice things up a bit with tales about Spider Woman, this does not mean that the weavers are agoggle in the mythical realms every time they twist a little cotton. If Loftin answers that my examples stem from the decadence of the modern period in Hopi history (which is his basic argument in the second part of the book), then I ask for proof that the Hopis experienced the sacred in Loftin's sense when they wove fabrics in 1832 or 1729 or 1652. TRADITION AND MODERNITY The bulk of the book consists of a detailed description of one 404 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VOL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="13">ARMIN GEERTZ ceremonial in Part One, followed by a loosely connected description of the history of the Hopis since 1860 in Part Two. Taken together, this book is claimed to be a "comprehensive and systematic interpretation of Hopi religion." Comprehensive it is not. It is systematic if by systematic we mean a systematic application of Eliadean theory. It is not an exhaustive, careful, or critical examination of the evidence at our disposal, nor is it an attempt to find out and document how the Hopis think or feel. It seems striking that the only part of the book that prompts Loftin to tender historical and sociological explanations is Part Two, which deals with change. In comparing the section on tradition, which has been systematically described and interpreted in non-historical, idealizing terms, with the section on change, which has been systematically described and interpreted in historical and sociopolitical terms, the result is unavoidable: Tradition is good and change is bad, the former because it is timeless, the latter because it's caused by the Americans. The comparison is illicit because the elements under comparison are misrepresented. Loftin is a victim of what I call the tradition/modernity paradigm that essentializes uncritical stereotypes glorifying tradition and vilifying modernity.18 What Loftin doesn't seem to realize is that the modern situation is Hopi religious reality. Loftin claims that the Hopis stray from the path "more than they once did" (112). But there is stronger evidence that religious conditions of this century are not essentially any different than those of earlier centuries. Again, my point is that the ideals of a religion are not its reality. They are ideals hardly ever attainable. Any Hopi will tell you this. Loftin fails to see that even given a transhistorical sacred something, religion is not that sacred something. Religion is a genuinely human product, and it is nothing more nor less than social strategy. STEREOTYPES AS KNOWLEDGE19 Stereotypes about Native Americans reach several centuries into European history. The construction of the savage by Europeans has involved exotic peoples who happened to have been the object of economic, political, or military interest: first the Black African, then the American Indian, then the Oriental, and finally the Muslim. According to the Dutch historian, Henri Baudet, the West has exhibited a deep ambivalence toward non- Western peoples. Franklin Baumer summarized Baudet's main points: On the one hand is his feeling, first expressed by the Greeks and later exhibited in the urge to expansion, of superiority and hostility to the "barbarians." On the other hand he compares himself unfavorably to certain non-European types, discovers in them qualities which he very much admires and finds lacking in himself and his own civilization. Baudet relates this latter feeling of modesty, and even of AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VoL. 20(3) 405</page><page sequence="14">CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS inferiority and guilt, to the age-old myth of man's fall from "Paradise." The European longs for his lost purity and looks for it in a far-distant time or place (Baudet 1965, vi). Robert Berkhofer Jr. argued along similar lines that Euroamerican views of the Indians are "inextricably bound up with the evaluation of their own society and culture." Thus, the fact that "Indians lacked certain or all aspects ofWhite civilization could be viewed as bad or good depending upon the observer's feelings about his own society and the use to which he wanted to put the image" (1978, 27-28). Baudet hypothesized that the more a culture is satisfied with its own historical achievements, as in nineteenth-century Europe (and the United States, I might add), the less it will be inclined "to seek Paradise beyond the horizon" (75). On the other hand, dissatisfaction will move a culture to be attracted to the outside world and to invest it with ideal attributes, as in the xenophilia of eighteenth-century Europe (74-75), which seems to match in many ways the late twentieth-century United States. Baudet noted that despite the glorification of the Indian during the European expansions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, "it failed to prevent the wholesale massacres that accompanied this expansion" (54). Baudet explained it as an expression of the dichotomy of the European soul. Gerald Sider (1987, 7), on the other hand, explained the stereotypization more in terms of the contradiction of the necessity of "creating the other as the other ... and incorporating the other within a single social and cultural system of domination." According to Sider, in the process of dialogue between the dominator and the dominated, each seeks to incorporate the other. This attempted incorporation simultaneously defines and denies the dialogue, "returning to the basic contradiction of this form of domination- that it cannot both create and incorporate the other as an other" (22). The problem of the Other does not restrict itself to the problem of stereotypization. It also involves the problem of Western scholars trying to represent, interpret, and re-create non-Western cultures. The scandals surrounding the work of Margaret Mead and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as recent theoretical reflection have forced ethnographers to become more aware of their role in the construction of the Other. The people they study have pointed out that cultural representation is ultimately linked to political power.20 And Native American nations are now attempting to gain the sole right to represent their cultures. CULTURAL COPYRIGHT AND RESEARCH ETHICS I suggest that there is a direct link between misrepresentations by primitivists and the political attempts by Native Americans to claim sole rights to representation. I suggest as well that even though the major source of tragedy and inequality in Native American history was the military and economic interests of Europe and the United States, much of the greed and 406 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VOL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="15">ARMIN GEERTZ violence was, in part at least, justified by primitivist assumptions. Whether for good or ill, cultural misrepresentation is assumed by indigenous peoples to be the symbol, if not the cause, of their problems. If cultural scientists want to solve this problem, they will have to stop romanticizing and start thinking. In this, the people we study are far ahead of us. In 1995 I was co-host of a conference with Louis A. Hieb at the Center for Southwest Research, University of New Mexico, and the Cultural Preservation Office of the Hopi Tribe. The conference, titled "Dialogue with the Hopis: Cultural Copyright and Research Ethics," was designed to bring Hopis and scholars together to explore ways of reducing tensions caused by cultural research. Recent conflicts between the Cultural Preservation Office and linguist Ekkehart Malotki concerning a projected collection of Hopi oral traditions, which the tribe succeeded in stopping by pressuring the University of Nebraska Press, has sent out unpleasant warning signals to scholars of Hopi culture. Unfortunately the Hopis do not distinguish between legitimate scholarly work and popularizations by pop writers and New Agers, and therefore they also blame anthropologists for the undesired attention the Hopis continually are subjected to by various interest groups. The conference was meant to address conflicts of interest between cultural copyright and public domain as well as specific ethical problems in research. The initial call for papers outlined the following catalogue of issues: 1. Accountability: How can and should scholars be responsible for the negative/positive consequences of their research activities? Who should the scholar be responsible to? What consideration should be given to how the Hopi community is affected by the research or sholarly activity/findings/publications? How can we go beyond the "laws" to reach what is equitable to the Hopi people? Who are the participants and whose values should be considered in reaching a compromise? 2. Reciprocity: What are scholars reciprocating to the Hopi Tribe in return for use of Hopi as subject matter? How can scholars reciprocate? What form should reciprocity take? 3. Uses of Hopi cultural resources: What is the basis for use of Hopi as research or scholarly study? Is this basis sound, current or should it be reexamined? Do Hopis have a voice in how, when and where Hopi will be used? Why and why not? 4. Research Potential: What research potential do scholars see in Hopi subject matter? Why? Whose needs does the research meet? How will the research results be used? What are the research needs of the Hopi Tribe? How can these needs be met? What can be published and should not be published? Who decides? 5. Technology: What is the technology which is used in current research/study or can potentially be used in the future? How can this technology benefit or be shared with the Hopi Tribe? What is the technological training potential for Hopi students in academic institutions? AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VOL. 20(3) 407</page><page sequence="16">CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS 6. Confidentiality: What is the scholar's obligation to keep confidential information from the "public domain" or being disseminated to the general public? Does Hopi have a say in how this takes place? Does the general public have a "right to know" that which is closed to the Hopi public? 7. Legislative Remedies: If compromise cannot be reached, what legislative remedies are possible, probable, and absolutely required? How can we reach that goal? What are the possibilities for ethical, moral, and public opinion changes that can be made without resort to legal remedies? 8. Creative Approaches: What are they? Is there a middle ground? This agenda was drawn up by Marilyn Masayesva who was the liaison for the Cultural Preservation Office. Marilyn Masayesva is a Hopi lawyer who comes from a family of politically and culturally active individuals. The well- known photographer, artist, and filmmaker Victor Masayesva Jr. is her brother, I and she is also related to the Tribal Chairman Vernon Masayesva. The excellent catalogue of issues raised hopes for a constructive dialogue and debate. The conference organizers did not expect us to be able to resolve the issues, but a dialogue would be welcomed as a beginning. Louis Hieb and I introduced a document during the conference calling for the establishment of a "Commission of Scientific Research on Hopi Culture" that would allow a forum for discussion and recommendation on specific scientific projects on the reservation and serve as a safety valve during crises. Cultural research is a critical project and is based on the need to know and to proliferate that knowledge. On the other hand, Hopi culture is based on knowledge gained through secrecy and initiation. Furthermore, the Hopis have a legitimate interest in preserving their privacy and protecting themselves from exploitation.22 Clearly these two cultural approaches are different, and therefore a commission comprised of Hopi officials and one or two scholars could serve to alleviate this disagreement through compromise and monitoring. Unfortunately, many key scholars in Hopi studies were unable to attend. On the Hopi side, the majority of the Hopi participants were hostile to cultural scholars. Consequently, there was very little dialogue and no negotiations. The Director of the Cultural Preservation Office, LeighJenkins, introduced a proposed "Protocol for Research, Publication and Recordings: Motion, Visual, Sound, Multimedia and Other Mechanical Devices," that in effect drastically restricts cultural research. And he introduced the protocol with the statement that all research on Hopi religion was forbidden unless specifically requested by the Hopi people. The latter was addressed to me. Even though I have had many years of equitable relations with Hopi friends, consultants, and colleagues, the increased political and personal pressures have made it very difficult for them and other Hopis who help scholars with cultural analysis. 408 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VOL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="17">ARMIN GEERTZ Peter Whiteley published an essay titled "The End of Anthropology (at Hopi)?" (1993). At the time it seemed a pessimistic assessment, but today the situation seems to warrant it. There are, however, certain restrictive conditions in which cultural research is allowed. A team of Hopi consultants and scholars has recently described what these conditions may be in relation to archeology and ethnohistory (Ferguson, Dongoske, Jenkins, Yeatts &amp; Polingyouma 1993). But it can be safely stated that cultural research conducted on the reservation in the interests of general cultural science is a closed chapter. There are many Hopis who disagree with the restrictive policies of the Cultural Preservation Office and who are quite willing to participate in cultural projects, but both they and scholars must be prepared for criticism and pressure from officials as well as village members. In fact, Leigh Jenkins told me recently that if it were possible, he would try to stop all publications on Hopi culture, even those based on secondary sources. CONCLUSION I personally disagree with this policy. I believe cultural researchers should be more sensitive to the issues of cultural property rights, but that we should not give up cultural research. Students of religion have had to deal with problems like these from the beginning of our science. The history of religions and comparative religion studies came into existence in direct confrontation with the theological suppression of our secular approach. That confrontation has never been overcome and probably never will. I suggest that we face a similar situation with Hopi tribal policy. Our work is not always perceived negatively by the people under study. Many religious people accept the need for a non-confessional, impartial study of religion. Religions that have experienced persecution due to hostile propaganda find the humanistic study of religion a welcome relief. But many people in more traditional "mainstream" religions also understand the need for a study of religion. Furthermore, in a more global perspective, the study of religion is appreciated in other pluralistic societies, such as in Africa, India, and Asia. I suggest that a more human-oriented study of religion when conducted wherever possible in cooperation with the humans under study will go a long way to help solve not only some of our methodological dilemmas but also our ethical ones.23 One of our most important jobs, though, is iconoclastic: to deconstruct primitivist representations and replace them with more sensible and accurate assessments. This reconstruction can be realized by downplaying the exotic and working closely with the people we study. In the midst of our lost innocence, we must still carry on the job of reformulating the study of religion. By reevaluating our database and weeding out the misrepresentations, we must together with our anthropological colleagues24 face the challenge ofglobalizing our discipline in response to the AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 1996/VOL. 20(3) 409</page><page sequence="18">CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS pressing demands of an intercultural world. We cannot afford to shy from the challenges.25 Cultural science has much to learn from its critics, but it must continue to contribute to the enlightenment of the world.
