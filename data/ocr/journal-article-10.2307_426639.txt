<plain_text><page sequence="1">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE P. A. MICHELIS 1. The Struggle for Perfection in Art One of the main characteristics of the artist is his constant striving for per- fection. But whereas the work's technical perfection is a matter of good execution and adaptation, its artistic completeness depends on its approximation to its ideal prototype. Naturally, neither the prototype nor the manner of its realization is im- mutable; both vary according to the mentality and style of an age. In classical art, precision and regularity of form prevail; for classical art tries to express abstract beauty. In the Middle Ages, precision and regularity retreat before a host of deviations in the form; for medieval art tries to express characteristic beauty. But whatever the mentality and style of an era, the ideal form can never be wholly realized. The imperfections and difficulties which matter presents distort it and prevent more than a mere approximation to it. The distance which consequently separates the real work from its ideal prototype can be covered by the spectator only by a flight of imagination, in which the work of art will assist him to the degree to which it suggests the ideal prototype through its imperfect reality. To this end, the artist employs a variety of suggestive means which heighten the spectator's imagination, and so assist him to grasp the ideal per- fection for which the work strives. Such means of suggestion, of course, amount to principles of composition. Yet some seem to be mere artifices. Is the purpose of such artifices the super- ficial one of merely deceiving the spectator? Certainly not, for in being discovered they would disappoint him. They must then have the more profound purpose of stressing the aesthetic experience which the work is striving to express. Indeed, by appealing to certain intellectual and psychological tendencies in the spectator, they stimulate his imagination and enable him to grasp truths of a higher order, to approach the transcendental or to perceive the ineffable by symbolic images. When the work of art effects such transport, its means of suggestion, far from disappointing the spectator on discovery, indeed become to him means of enchantment. Philosophy, too, makes use of symbolic images when it attempts to convey the transcendental, which an abstract terminology is not adequate to express. Plato, for instance, in order to describe the ascent of the soul, presents it as leading a chariot heavenwards. Architecture, again, resorts to symbolic imagery when it borrows naturalistic forms to illustrate and enhance an architectural function. The Caryatids, the acanthus on the Corinthian column, the spiral volutes on the Ionic, are instances in point; all lend a richer and finer meaning to the action which the work executes. More subtly and eloquently than mere masonry could have done, the Caryatids suggest effortless support by the car- riage of their figures, as again, the volutes suggest a feeling of elasticity in supporting the abacus. 19</page><page sequence="2">20 P. A. MICHELIS But in architecture, even abstract forms, wholly devoid of familiar natural images, may constitute a symbolic language, by appealing to man's instinctively anthropomorphic view of things. This makes him conscious, by aesthetic empa- thy, of the action and counteraction of the forces in any and every form. Of course, reason complements such intuitive appreciation. The mind comes to take notice of what, say, a column as such, achieves; but the primary approach to it is instinctively anthropomorphic, seeing in base, trunk, and capital a sug- gestion also of the articulation of the human body. If flutings, by their verticality, lend it height and vigor; if its diminution lends it force and its entasis energy, the impressions in the spectator spring from an innate aesthetic empathy (Einfilhlung) towards the action of the forces in a work. But more of this later. For the present suffice it to say that fluting, diminution, entasis, are all means devised by art to suggest that qualities of force, height, vigor, animation. But the column itself, deprived of any or all of these properties, would still have stood upright. Another not unusual form of suggestion in art-though philosophy rejects it-is logical inconsistency. Take the quotation: "Poete prends ton luth, et me donne un baiser." Had the poet said, "et donne moi un baiser," his sentence, besides being a commonplace, if not a hackneyed solicitation, would have left us wondering whether the favor had been granted. By this transition from the imperative mood to the present tense, the first phrase is subordinated to the second, the kiss is given, and the solicitation, which was implied, is realized as if by magic, before it has well had time to be expressed. Homer is full of such inconsistencies. Again, we find them in architecture; for instance, when, in the Doric temple, the corner column is removed from the axis of the triglyph, and in thus narrowing the pteron's extreme intercolumnia, gives the impression that the pteron shares in the reinforcement of the building's angles-a reinforcement essential to its stability. Painting too adopts such inconsistencies in perspective, as we may see in those Byzantine representations which show a three-quarter face over a side-view of the figure. By this device of revealing more than the profile, which we would normally have expected in a figure standing sideways, the whole personality of the subject is at once enhanced. Still another method of implication is the indirect one of presenting the object, not in itself, but through its effect on its environment. Homer, for instance, in order to praise Helen's beauty describes merely the impression she made on the old men of Troy, and so conveys her indescribable beauty far more convincingly than if he had described her features. In painting, examples of such enhance- ment by implication are to be seen in the halo surrounding the portraits of saints; or in architecture, when the sekos of the temple is surrounded by the pteron, which at once makes it precious. Art often adopts more straightforward means of suggestion such as onomato- poeia and alliteration in poetry; or, in painting, the prismatic colors in their order, to depict the glory of Christ; or, in architecture, the multiplication of a pilaster's projection, the multi-stemmed pier, or, finally, the perspective con- vergence of the sides of the temple, to emphasize flight towards the altar. When Aristotle in his Poetics tells us that Homer taught the other poets also "to speak</page><page sequence="3">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 21 with due deceit,' his "deceit" refers to the creation of such aesthetic illusions. The spectator, though fully aware of the deception, seeks it in art because it compels him to rise from prosaic reality to an ideal region. This is more con- spicuous in the theater, where an audience will follow a drama intently, knowing full well that it is a piece of fiction. Architecture itself-which Plato ranks as a science rather than an art, in that it constructs realities and does not, like paint- ing, produce illusory images-cannot escape the creation of illusory effects; for, in the last analysis, its constructions are but a reflection-the image-of an archetype. Architectural artifices are obviously optical. But since visual impressions are judged by the mind according to the mental and psychological stimulus they provide, optical illusions are, in essence, logical and psychological means of suggestion which influence our inner being, because they appeal to an artistic sense in us. This truth, however, was entirely overlooked by those writers who insist on regarding such artifices as perspective or optical illusions deriving merely from the mechanism of sight, and having no other purpose than to delude the spectator, or to correct the inevitable optical distortions which emerge in the course of construction, by restoring geometric figures and, above all, straight lines. The result of this attitude was that architecture came to be looked upon as aiming either at scenic effects, or at purely geometrical constructions. Thus ancient Greek architecture and the classical ideal of abstract beauty, generally, were reduced to mere geometry. It was not until romanticism set in, with its love of the transcendental and its understanding of picturesque architecture-such as the medieval which is full of irregularities-that the classical style began to be better appreciated. An approach marked more by artistic feeling than geometrical reasoning led the romantic age to recognize the refining beauty of curve and polychromy in the classical work. Ruskin, in a reaction from the geometrical mentality, went as far as to advocate the abolition of every geometric motif from art. Since his time, however, the irregularities and the optical artifices, respectively displayed in medieval and classical architecture, have been widely discussed. The conclu- sions drawn-which we are nowadays content to accept, perhaps because the problem no longer preoccupies us-were unfortunately wide of the mark; for they established that deviations of form in classical architecture are optical corrections, and that those in medieval architecture are the imperfections of careless construction. The same phenomenon is thus attributed to deliberate refinement of form, in the one case, and to accidental ruggedness, in the other. It would seem then, that deviations of form have eluded theoretical explanation so far; yet every art period evolves its own deviations, each time according to its peculiar style, and often without reference to those that went before. The subject (which affects also contemporary art) well deserves closer exami- nation, not only for the interest it offers in itself, but also because it leads to the disclosure of one of the most important and dramatic phases of a work of art- the suggestion of the perfect, through the imperfect, form; its way of "speaking with due deceit," in order to beguile or enchant us. I Aristotle, Poetics, 1460 a 19.</page><page sequence="4">22 P. A. MICHELIS If we are to examine the subject here with particular reference to architecture, we must study it in two main stages-that of vision in architecture, which treats of optical illusions generally; and that of the value of deviations of form in architecture. 2. Vision in Architecture If optical problems, which must always affect architecture, have ceased to preoccupy the contemporary architect, it is because the striving for perfection nowadays is directed exclusively towards technical conquests. Since breaking away completely from the traditional forms of architecture, the deliberate use of an optical artifice has come to be considered as an insincere and elaborate device. The principle mainly kept in view today is that "form follows function;" a function, however, never other than organic to the contemporary mind, which does not accept that a form, by its optical refinement, can convey certain visions not to be apprehended by reason, but only to be divined. Yet we cannot deny that our eyesight still shows us objects in perspective and that the accompany- ing optical illusions spring from a deeper stimulation of mind and spirit. None- theless, we no longer believe in orthodox perspective nor in optical corrections as they were applied in an older art. For our spiritual attitude has changed; our view of the scheme of things has changed, leaving us, in the transition, uncertain of our views and of how to express them. Be that as it may, we no longer design our works perspectively as the past generation did, because we do not believe that their value depends on the ap- parent proportions they acquire from a fixed point of view. Since we are far more concerned with the organic growth of our composition, we usually design it as though from a bird's eye view, and prefer to make models of our works. Rapid technological advances, with their constant innovations in construction, prevent the perfection of form that is achieved by repetition and gradual im- provement (as in the Doric temple). Originality lies no longer in the consummate type, but in innovation. The effect of such a mentality in art is strained and vacuous expression. Nor is the architect any longer the master builder, who is immediately aware of, and can thus correct, any imperfections and optical distortions the building may present as it is taking shape. The contemporary architect is a scientist who designs plans in his office, to be carried out by the contractor. The architect draws plans, sections, elevations in a conventional language of projective geometry, and the picture of the whole exists only in his imagination. Among the arts of design today, it is only the painter and the sculptor who still retain the privilege of executing their own work, and of trans- ferring their vision into the material without the interference of abstract designs. The architect may of course draw sketches in perspective or make a model, but he cannot escape the conventional language of geometry, which deforms everything. Even his models are necessarily on another scale and in a different material from those of the real work. The architect must, in consequence, com- plete every detail of his building before erection begins, and if he is to express himself fully, he must know how vision acts and reacts, so that he can foresee what impressions will be derived from the forms he designs geometrically. However, even did he know all the secrets of his art, the contemporary architect</page><page sequence="5">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 23 would still be hampered by the dependence of his structure on the growing possibilities of the machine. Even in countries less advanced technologically, the machine is steadily taking the place of manual labor and, consequently, of the craftsman's hand which knew how to bring feeling into a form. The spread of mechanization has affected men's mentality and debased their conception of artistic perfection, which they seek now in technical skill; but technical skill demands nothing beyond accurate application, resistance, straight lines, and swift execution. The conception of "style" in art has given place to a taste for the "normal" and the "standard" type, with which mass production and pre- fabrication have made us familiar. The result is a contemporary formalism, dominated by certain standardized patterns, and a looseness of style which rests on wholly subjective artistic criteria. The artist, from the Renaissance onwards, knew how to observe the objects of the external world objectively. In principle, it sufficed him to look at them perspectively; according to an optical system, that is, which was gradually elabo- rated into a very science. The artists of the Middle Ages, on the contrary, show an almost reversed perspective and no system, often setting down on the same canvas views from above and from below, without reducing the size of objects according to distance. They had no fixed point of sight and their manner of viewing was subjective. In the Renaissance, perspective influenced architecture too, for it provided the architect with a principal point of view from which he could ascertain the perspective distortions of the building's parts, especially in height, and thus correct them. This was one of the reasons-i.e., in order to make the building seem well-proportioned-why the dome of St. Peter in Rome was built with two shells; with a lower, practically spherical one for the spectator of the interior, and a higher parabolic one for the spectator of the exterior. Here we have an instance of perspective correction. The discovery of perspective further enabled the architect to produce per- spective illusions, and estimate exactly how far they enhanced his building. Michael Angelo in the Piazza del Campidoglio, by making the side buildings diverge, brings the facade of the central building nearer to the spectator, because the distance seems shorter. Bernini does the same for the facade of St. Peter's, by the divergence of the colonnades in the square; the whole building is further enhanced by an uphill inclination of the axis of access to it. Again, in the Scala Regia of the Vatican, because the walls on either side converge, the spectator standing at the entrance overestimates the length of the staircase, thus lending it additional majesty. Anyone standing in the depth would seem taller than his real height because the spectator at the entrance would imagine him to be at a greater distance than he is in fact. Such perspective corrections and creation of illusions were not unknown to very much older architectures.2 Certain Egyptian temples, by progressively lowering the roof and so making the sanctuary more remote, enhance its mystery. 2 See Choisy, A., Histoire de l'architecture (Baranger, 1929). Viollet-le-Duc relied on the principle of spherical vision to show that the diminution of the column was determined by its height and the recession of floors by the building's general proportions-at least from one point of view.</page><page sequence="6">24 P. A. MICHELIS Some Romanesque churches also resort to this device. Again, we find in Egyptian architecture two obelisks of different thickness placed at an unequal distance from a pylon, so as to appear equal, since the more slender one-being on the first plane, is overestimated by comparison with its remoter fellow. In a Greek inscription in Priene, the letters in the upper lines are made larger so that, seen in perspective, they appear equal to those on the lower line. The Romans so corrected the caissons of the Pantheon, that perspective distortion is avoided. Such wise exploitation of perspective illusions is legitimate in art, because it makes for perfection of form, enhances the work, and creates certain impressions which promote its scope. Now Baroque art made immoderate use of perspective artifices to create utterly fictitious impressions, thus displaying its mastery of perspective machinery; but means now became the end. By the arrangement of certain bands, frames, or imposts, as if they converged perspectively, it "faked" depth in doorways, windows, arches, even in apses of churches. If we look at the apse of S. Maria of S. Satiro in Milan, we find it imitating the perspective dis- tortion of caissons of a non-existent barrel vault. Architecture of this kind not unnaturally resembles stage scenery and dis- illusions the spectator by its shallowness. Its ingenious "fakes" do not convince the spectator, who very easily discerns them and who demands far more from a building than he does from the scenery in the theater. Not that the more subtle, the "legitimate" perspective illusion is more perma- nent or its illusory nature less likely to become apparent; indeed, looked at from the opposite point of view, it will create exactly the reverse impression. For instance, the perspective flight of a floor and of a pergola imitated in a wrought- iron gate of the Dom in Constanza, seem to recede in the opposite direction when we look at the door from the other side. The Scala Regia, again, seen from its extreme end, appears shorter than it does seen from its entrance. Such contra- dictions are redeemed only because we are not aware of both impressions simul- taneously; and it is only when, compared in memory, we realize their self-contra- diction, that they are seen to have been pure illusion. Even perspective corrections in the proportions of a building are occasionally purely external corrections of form unrelated to its organic demands; and the sensitive spectator is usually aware of it. Architectural parts or halls, which have been given undue height, so that they shall appear well-proportioned only from a certain view-point, seen at close quarters or from the interior of a building, do not seem true, or in keeping with the whole. Very clearly, such corrections suffer from the fallacious assumption of perspective that objects are viewed from a fixed point; this is not so, in fact. There is no point of sight from which the architect can determine with absolute certainty the perspective impressions his building will make. Any point he may choose may make for formalism in the building, and rouse in the spectator a sense of confinement. In trying to appreci- ate a building we move about it as much as possible. We change our distance, and even in standing still our eyes never stay focused on one point. In our eyes, 3Pennethorpe, in his Geometry and Optics of Ancient Architecture (London 1876), fixes three points from which the spectator prefers to observe the monuments on the Acropolis. The first and most important is at the Eastern entrance of the Propylae. Maertens, in his Der Optische Masstab (see Wasmuth's Lexikon Der Baukunst) takes this idea still further</page><page sequence="7">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 25 the surface of section of the visual rays is spherical, not plane,' and perspective distortions are not, therefore, magnified to the degree to which they are in the photographic plate or in orthodox perspective. Moreover, our vision is binocular; and finally, our imagination also comes into play as it composes the image of the building from the numerous impressions conveyed by the eye and retained in the memory. Orthodox perspective, then, would not seem to be as objective as it is professed to be. Nor was medieval perspective in fact (though not worked out into a system) wholly erroneous; it was a perspective "in motion." In painting, moreover, it stressed the order of things, not according to their size and distance, but in a grading of their significance and value. In contemplating an architectural work, indeed, we automatically proceed to such grading. We do not merely photograph it like a camera, but, moving around it, try to distinguish its primary from its secondary elements; to grasp their structural function in the whole; and ultimately to re-compose the work in imagination. Thus we are left, not with a purely external picture of soulless, even if well-proportioned, forms, but with a vivid impression of organic parts co- operating to compose a significant, intelligent pattern. The architectural work, then, brings a vision not only of magnitudes and quantities, but also of qualities and values, which may suggest to the spectator even those proportions not always visible in the work. May we not call this mental grasp of an external image, an "internal inspective order," as distinct from any external perspective order? In this survey of the mind, form is appreciated not in and for itself, but for its organic, tectonic properties. Its perfection consequently demands more than considerations of perspective. Were it otherwise, indeed, we could not have appreciated the architectural masterpieces of ages which knew nothing of orthodox perspective. In primitive and children's paintings, and again in those of the Middle Ages and of our own age, we find this sort of "inspective" order. Not only because the artist's imagination magnifies all that seems to him more important, but also in affirming that each monument is best viewed, according to its height, from three funda- mental distances which form visual angles of 180, 270, and 45?. All these assertions, how- ever, are based on the wrong premise that we look at objects as does the camera-motion- less, and as though they were projected on our eye as on a plane surface. Nor is any account taken of our memory, which re-composes our numerous impressions into a single picture of the work. These principles are, therefore, inapplicable to any group of buildings. An- other theory is that, in placing the buildings on the Acropolis, the Propylae was taken as the point of sight, to form visual angles with the bases of the buildings. The harmony of the group would then depend on the relation of the angles to one another, according to certain proportions. This theory, however, is exploded if we imagine a building of a different height, or even the same building in a different attitude, introduced in that angle; not to mention the fact that, as soon as we shift the point of vision from the Propylae, all these angles disappear. (See P. Michelis, "Space and Town Planning in Ancient Greece," Annales Techniques, Athens, No. 151 (1938), which deals with Doxiades' theory (Raumordnung im Griechischen Stddtebau, Berlin 1937.) 4Hauck relied on this fact for his theory of a "subjective" as distinct from the scientific perspective, which was generally considered "objective." Though he is right in denying that perspective is based wholly on objective principles, his theory in general, is nonethe- less fallacious (See note 9).</page><page sequence="8">26 P. A. MICHELIS because the psychology of vision plays its part in the composition; a practice that has no place in the "scientific" system of perspective. When we watch a figure moving away, its size does not seem to us to dwindle progressively as it becomes more distant, because we know it to be constant. This fact explains why vertical perspective in medieval painting does not strike us as odd. Then again, an object may appear larger than it is, irrespective of distance, by comparison with an object smaller than itself, beside it. The moon appears to us larger when rising than when it is soaring mid-heaven, because when it is low, mountains, trees, or houses provide for us a measure of comparison. Therefore, from a psychological point of view, no form has absolute dimensions, as determined by perspective, but only relative dimensions according to its environment. Here then, we have illusions of scale-illusions particularly true of an artistic composition, in which they can be produced within the work itself by the juxtaposition of parts, so that comparison makes their size relative. In overlooking this fact, works of architecture are often out of scale. Further- more, in any work of art, each form acquires its special value by the part it plays in the whole composition, as do notes by the melody they make up, or words by the poem they help to compose. In architecture the column, when in the pteron of a Greek temple it supports the entablature, has a different value from what it has in a facade as a half-column, supporting practically nothing; or from its value when it stands free as a monumental stele. These relations of values, as they affect the purely visual representation, present another form of illusion, over and above the illusions of scale mentioned earlier. The artists of the Renais- sance, in order now to avoid, now to exploit such illusions, frequently departed from the principles of orthodox perspective. In painting they often used two points of view on the same canvas, or magnified a face on the second plane, so that its importance should not be minimized. In architecture, they often changed the scale of the same parts according to the section of the building in which they were placed. For instance, in the Cancellaria, in order to lend the upper floors apparent magnitude, the stones there are smaller than on the lower floor. And again, to make that floor appear light, the workmanship of the stones and the shape of the pilasters varies. In striving for the artistic perfection of an architectural form, what is needed over and above perspective order is "inspective" order. Art does not need only perspective illusions but mainly aesthetic optical illusions; illusions which do not depend only on size and distance, but also on the relations of sizes and values which are combined into a composition. The spectator, too, will apply to the form he contemplates his innate sense of symmetry, regularity, direction. If these properties are either lacking in the composition, or only conventionally reproduced, or schematically applied, he will underestimate the work. Sym- metry must be dynamic, so that what should be made evident, far more than mere figures about an axis, are forces balancing about a center of gravity. Regu- larity should be suggested as an ideal pattern, and the directions here implied rather than clearly defined. In other words, the work of art gains more by sug- gestion (which brings the spectator's imagination into play) than by outright projection of the qualities it defines.</page><page sequence="9">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 27 The mind, in its assessment of the forms of the outer world, sees in them not only relations of magnitudes, but also actions and counter-actions, which balance them in a pattern. It thus vests each form with a tectonic character. And this concerns architecture particularly. The actions of the forces in a form may, as we stressed in the introduction, be illustrated symbolically by phytomorphic repre- sentations (as in the columns of Egyptian temples) or by anthropomorphic representations (as in the case of the Caryatids), but no less in its abstract forms themselves. For where the architect cannot borrow familiar images from nature, he can suggest the action of the forces by exploiting man's innate tendency to look at every object anthropomorphically; by guiding man's aesthetic empathy to perceive the qualities they illustrate. Thus, the column, divided into base, trunk, and capital, will suggest the human body; its fluting, which emphasizes verticality, will evoke height and vigor; its diminution, upward-straining (be- cause we too, when stretching up, stand with our feet wide apart, exactly as the widened lower diameter of the column seems to do). Finally, as it swells like a muscle under the burden it carries, it stresses resistance to weight. The cone and the pyramid invariably suggest a rising movement-so forcibly, indeed, that Raphael drew the "Assumption of the Virgin Mary" in an acute-angled triangle. In architecture, we have the Pyramids, the Gothic piers, even the pyramid-like convergence of the Parthenon's columns to convince us of this, as we find in their buildings a distinct tendency to rise. If we look now at the horizontal beam, our first impression is that there is no action here, that the part is in repose, as is the human body when lying supine. In nature too, we find that steep mountains, which disturb us by their structural force, are in the shape of the pyramid; whereas a calm ocean presents a level, horizontal surface. In painting, the predominance of a horizontal line brings serenity and repose to the picture (as the eminent example of da Vinci's "Last Supper" will convince us). In architecture, too, stress of the horizontal has the same effect (as Egyptian temples, for instance, will show). Verticality will give us a feeling of elevation, as is testified to by the Gothic cathedrals. In fact, however, the horizontal beam is not inactive, for it resists bending. In curving it upwards, therefore, its resistance seems to have been overcome. That was what Greek architecture did. In the Parthenon, the repetition of such curves in the stylobate raised the building's center of gravity, which the pyramid-like convergence of the columns had lowered. Finally, circular buildings suggest centrifugal and centripetal forces, and the dome (in imitation of the dome of the sky) conveys the concentration of forces both within and without it. Rodin, in order to suggest concentration in his statue of "The Thinker," shows his model's knees drawn up and his torso bent forward. Our empathy extends even to geometric figures. We feel of a perpendicular rectangle that it stands, and of a horizontal one that it sits. Nor do we regard their area as a vacuum but rather as a dynamic space; while even in a line, whether straight or curved, we feel a tensile capacity. It was on these observa- tions that Lipps based his "aesthetic mechanics," by which he explains how optical illusions emerge from geometric figures.5 He maintains that we over- 5 Lipps, Raumaesthetik und Geometrisch-Optische Taaschungen (Barth, 1897).</page><page sequence="10">28 P. A. MICHELIS estimate an apparently principal tendency in a form at the expense of the second- ary one, and this error of judgment leads to optical illusions. Thus a perpendicular line seems to us longer than an equal horizontal line because the first appears to stand upright, to be performing an action, while the other seems to be lying inert. That is why, before a square can appear perfect, it must be slightly wider than it is high. Again, a letter "A" seems larger when inscribed in a circle, because within the limited area of the circumference there seems to be more intense dynamism than in the infinite space outside it. (Within the circle the figure seems to increase; drawn outside it, it seems to decrease.) As a result of our conviction of forces acting, not only in geometric figures, but also in every visible form, all forms create optical illusions, and therefore no object appears to us exactly as it is in reality.6 It follows that any forms we may design or erect will be pleasing only in as far as such optical illusions have been taken into ac- count. If we take the printed figure "8" and letter "S" as examples, we may think each to be composed of two equal sections. If we reverse them however, we realize that the lower part is wider in both. The artist draws them so in- stinctively, feeling that thus they stand more firmly and at the same time seem taller and more delicate. We create the optical illusion here, compelled by our urge to surpass symmetry by height, and so elevate the form and conquer gravity.7 Perhaps the diminution of the Doric column was just such an instinc- tive refinement by architects who felt that, thus augmented below and tapering above, the column would seem to stand more firmly and to be taller. To the archi- tect, the fact that his column is upright and firm is not enough; he wants it also to display its resistance, its action. In the case of the Parthenon column this was achieved by diminution, flutings, and entasis, which brought the form vigor and animation. The whole temple, by the pyramid-like convergence of its columns, gains apparent firmness, height, and delicacy, and thanks to the curves of stylobate and architrave, it seems to breathe. Obviously no refinements can afford to contravene the laws of statics. Dimi- nution, entasis, and curves in each column, all conform to its demands; but being only slight modifications, they little affect the stability of the work. Artistically, however, these slight modifications are of the greatest importance, in that they underline what the spirit achieves. With only the science of statics to inform us about an architectural work, it would seem to us a dead composition. Yet, what illusions we introduce in the work spring from our aesthetic sense of statics; and because they satisfy this sense in us, they are no longer illusions but revelations of the truth that spirit has conquered matter. In this sense all art is an illusion revealing the truth. This is not so much of a paradox as the converse idea, that artistic regularity entails geometrical regularity. Stuart, who first measured the Parthenon, failed 6 CAra Revesz, in his System der Optischen und Haptischen Taiischungen (Zts. f. Psych. Bd. 131, Heft 4-6, 1934) distinguishes between illusions that alter the form, those that give shape to the form, and those which correct a form. 7 Lipps observes that the artist effects an objective correction in a form in order to dispel a displeasing illusion; the spectator then corrects this correction subjectively, since no correction can be perfect; and in thus denying a negation, he derives a positive impression, which is a source of heightened pleasure.</page><page sequence="11">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 29 to see the entasis and the curves of the temple because he assumed all its lines to be straight. When it was later observed that there is not a single straight line in the Parthenon, recourse was had to Vitruvius's theory that its refinements were optical corrections designed to prevent the illusions which straight lines would inevitably have caused. In other words, the view was adopted that the genetrixes of the columns, without entasis, would have appeared concave. The temple without the pyramid-like convergence of its columns would have seemed to spread upwards fanwise and the stylobate and architrave, without convex curves, would have seemed to sag in the middle. But, thanks to these refinements, all lines, it was claimed, appear straight.8 This is not so in fact. We only think them to be straight, while what we feel is that they are unusually beautiful. When we do realize that they are curved, we not only continue to regard them as curved, but would, in fact, not wish them otherwise. It seems futile to maintain, then, that the temple sought to give an illusion of straight lines as being more pleasing. Moreover, even admitting for a moment that the illusions created by straight lines in the Parthenon were not corrected, why should they have jarred on us? Optical illusions displease us only if they clash with the properties, func- tions, and directions we attribute to the lines. And that is precisely what happens here; these lines are the limits of forms; they define material forms; and matter has weight and resists compression in thrusts and in bending. Therefore the temple would have given us the illusion of columns spreading fanwise, of a bent epistylium and so on, had not the architect's aesthetic sense of statics reacted, and thus led him to give entasis to the column, to narrow the intercolumnia towards the corners, to make the corner columns thicker, to incline them all towards the sekos, and to curve the horizontal lines upwards. These are refine- ments, prompted by a compulsion to surpass gravity, not mere counter-illusions designed to restore straight lines in the stone. They are revelations of the truth indicating the triumph of spirit over matter, as they make the temple appear winged. This impression in fact, so forcibly suggested by the colonnade of the Greek temple, may have had something to do with its name of "pteron," or "wing." The fallacy of Hauck's contention that the Parthenon's curves are an applica- tion of the lines of spherical perspective is proved by the fact alone that the stylobate is convex.9 Spherical perspective would have made it concave. Nor 8 Durm in his Die Baukunst der Griechen, Handb. der Baukunst, maintains that the curves of the stylobate were the result of the building's settling in the ground. Doerpfeld, in his turn, maintained that they were deliberately made to allow the rainwater to run from the floor of the pteron. My point of view on the subject was first expressed in: "'Es- thetique de l'illusion d'optique dans l'architecture," Annales Techniques, fasc. 172 (Athenes 1939). 9 Hauck, in his Die Subjektive Perspektive und die Horizontalen Curvaturen des Dorischen Styls (Stuttgart, 1879), attempts to explain this away by saying that, in looking at the Parthenon from the Propylae, the stylobate is above our eye level, and therefore appears convex instead of concave; he evidently takes little account of Doric temples which are not on a height. He further maintains that the curves of spherical perspective were applied from the moment the termination of the frieze into a triglyph instead of into a half -metope, necessitated narrowing the extreme intercolumnia; for, with the columns thus denser at the pteron's extremities, it became necessary, according to the laws of spherical perspective</page><page sequence="12">30 P. A. MICHELIS can we admit that these illusions are the product of kinesthetic sensations only-of muscle-joint sensations of the eye, that is-for then, there would be little point in the corrections. When a form jars on us, it is never because it strains the eye-muscle, but because it repels the mind, which does not tolerate ugliness and seeks unity in variety: and if certain optical illusions are the result of purely physiological reactions, it is only thanks to our psychological and mental reactions that we take notice of them at all; and it is to stimulate such psychological and mental reaction that art employs illusions. Some secondary refinements in the Doric temple have their source in perspec- tive, but the main ones spring from the psychology of vision; for each separate refinement is part of a single comprehensive scheme to animate the work as a whole. In other words, the refinement of the part fulfills a demand of the whole, so that the temple achieves the elegance it seeks. Consequently, the corrections of the parts can be explained only by the whole composition, which must obvi- ously create optical distortions in its parts. The widening of the corner column, for instance, is due to the counteraction of the whole to the thrusts, as is also which prevail in primitive vision, to give the stylobate and epistyle curves, and the col- umns entasis, in order to complete the picture of the building. Now, it seems highly im- probable that the problem of the triglyphs in itself should have so revolutionized the temple; these innovations are far more likely to have been the result of a more general trend in art. Nor is spherical perspective likely to have been the criterion in shaping the temple. The Romans, who were less sensitive, left a half -metope at the ends, while retain- ing diminution and entasis of column. Then, again, the theory is exploded when we con- sider that Ionic temple, in which the problem of the triglyphs does not arise, also display entasis and curves. Finally, to imagine that our artistic sense is satisfied merely because the eye is enabled to take the picture in comfortably, is far-fetched, if not absurd, because the eye is not just a camera with a spherical lens. Hauck's opinion that we see lines as straight because we think them to be so does not necessarily prove that we appreciate curves only because they agree with the principles of spherical perspective innate to primi- tive man. Panofsky, in his Die Perspektive als Symbolische Form (Vortrage der Bibliothek War- burg, 1921-25), p. 263, emphasizing the contrast between objective reality and subjective spherical perspective, maintains that we have become so used to the apparent leftward curve of any perpendicular line, that, by a sort of reaction, or-to use his own word-as a "counter-compensation," we imagine it curving to the right. If we would make the line seem straight, we must emphasize the curve considerably. In the case of the column, this is done by diminution. Panofsky claims to explain thus the ancient assertion that the cylinder appears concave in the middle. Now, the mind reacts usually to feelings it controls, and not to assumed impressions, of the existence of which we are not even certain. Penrose, in his An Investigation of the Principles of Athenian Architecture, London 1851, influenced by the theory of optico- physiology, developed then by Helmholtz, attempted to explain the Parthenon's illusions on the assumption that the acute angles of the pediment became optically obtuse, and the base of its triangle, therefore, appears concave. Thiersch, again, in his Optische Tatischungen auf dem Gebiete der Architektur, (Zts. f. Bauwesen, XXIII, 1873) finds a similar angle being formed, though perspectively, in his case. By a process of highly complicated reasoning, he attempts to explain also the inclination of the pteron's columns towards the sekos, having evidently lost sight of the fact that the Parthenon's pediment is not a mere geometric figure, but a three-dimensional concrete form, with action and meaning, which therefore creates optical illusions demanding corrections that are, at the same time, sym- bolic expressions guiding to the truth.</page><page sequence="13">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 31 in large measure, the densening of the extreme intercolumnia. We say "in large measure," because the colonnade considered by itself very happily suggests, by the gradual closing of its gaps, that it is drawing to an end. The theory of form (Gestalttheorie) admits the influence of the whole on the part. Finally, in contemplating a form, the mind follows the dialectics of the ele- ments as they effect unity in variety. In following this process logically at the beginning, it is only natural to consider the narrowing of the extreme inter- columnia as inconsistent with the order of the triglyphs; we soon realize, however, that the pteron is thus introduced into a higher order-that of the whole. The mind now, guided and raised to this higher plane, rejoices as it surveys the whole and obtains a deeper insight into its value as a work of art. By a series of such dialectical compositions of oppositions, the parts are co-ordinated into units; these again, subordinated to greater units, and all together, despite their con- trasts, contribute to the formation of a unique whole. This unique composition, then, relies on these special forms; they alone are proper, as they are peculiar, to it; no forms in any other, however similar composition, could be quite identical with them. The temple of Phigaleia, like the Parthenon, belongs to the Doric Order and is a masterpiece of its kind by the same master, Ictinus. But, unlike the Parthenon, it does not accompany the entasis in its columns by their pyramid- like convergence, and shows no curves in stylobate and architrave. Its position, its size, its material, have imposed variations on forms that have gone to compose another original pattern.'0 The Greek temple is no isolated example of the "inspective order." Such re- finements of form have ever been instinctively used in architecture, according to the possibilities and the character of each style. The temple of Medinet- Habut has lines curved horizontally instead of vertically; this lends animation and entasis to its horizontality. The Greek stadia display horizontal curves for the same reason, and not in order to facilitate vision, as is frequently maintained; for these curves are so slight as not to affect the comfort of vision. The Parthenon, too, has horizontal curves," though here they are not dominant. Indeed, we find such curves in several medieval buildings, too, as well as in the facade of St. Mark's in Venice.'2 The pyramid-like shape of the Doric temple is to be found also in the Egyptian temple, though more emphasized, as the heavy Egyptian style demands. Con- versely, the Ionic temple shows only the slightest inclination of columns, which, slender and widely-distant as they are, do not admit of acuter inclination. Inclination is displayed in Renaissance buildings, too, though in another form; in the receding walls of superimposed floors on the facade. Here again, the angles are reinforced so as to appear to resist the thrusts. In the Palazzo Ducale of Venice, the corner column is thicker than the rest; in the Palladio basilica, the 10 This temple displays emphasis on the northern side, the trunks of its columns are shorter and their height is countered by taller capitals. At the same time, their lower diameter is larger by 4 cm. to make them appear more bulky. 11 Michaelis, in his Der Parthenon, attributes them to an effort to improve the lighting on all sides of the building. 12 William Henry Goodyear, "The Architectural Refinements of St. Mark's at Venice" (Memoirs of Art and Archaeology, Vol. I, No. 2).</page><page sequence="14">32 P. A. MICHELIS intercolumnia grow denser at the corners, as in the Greek temple. Finally, as Goodyear13 observes, the central naves in some Byzantine and Gothic churches have their walls sloping outwards, to give the impression that the space above the columns widens. This occurs also in Palladio's S. Giorgio Maggiore at Venice. We need not dwell on the inclination of secondary elements such as statues, pinnacles, acroteria, etc., which, by their apparent counteraction, often empha- size certain subtle refinements of the primary members. So far we have dealt only with buildings which taper upwards, displaying a natural tendency to reduce weight progressively towards the top. Some buildings and architectural members, however, do the reverse. The Minoan and the Mycenean column opens out like a lily and tapers downwards. Chinese temples project heavy, curved roofs, resting on a few frail supports. Like pagodas, they give an impression of precarious balance, as though they stood on one foot. But all these, being works of art, succeed in balancing as effortlessly and as gracefully as a dancer poised on one foot. The aesthetic appeal such forms may make, if it may certainly be attributed to empathy, is as certainly not to be explained by the operation of the eye-muscles or by spherical perspective. Indeed, did our appreciation here rely on either, we might have sought entasis in the Mycenean column-a refinement which would have been utterly misplaced in this style, since it would have weakened, instead of strengthened, the column. If, then, we wish to refine the forms of modern architecture, it would be futile, without first fully grasping its nature, to imitate these classical or medieval re- finements. Modern architecture is not an architecture of beam on post, as was the Greek, or of domes and buttresses, as was the medieval. Its material-rein- forced concrete-necessarily makes its constructions monolithic, with the piers running into the beam to form a frame with it, and again, the slabs running into the beam. We cannot, therefore, make one correction in the pier and another in the beam. Their continuity must be emphasized, and it is only by doing this that -given the plastic nature of the material-we can succeed in displaying our conquest of matter. But static calculations alone will not achieve the result, for at most they can but exploit the resistance of the material and define form quantitatively. The architect must summon to his aid aesthetic mechanics, which can transform matter into animated impressive symbols and define form qualitatively. The upward inclination of the cantilevers, or the convex curving of the frame's beam, which are refinements of great importance to modern con- struction, have not been dictated by static laws. Statics can lead to the mush- room-shaped slabs and columns (like those designed by Maillart and F. L. Wright) which are refined modern forms in the architecture of concrete. They can also lead to mushroom-shaped slabs and columns with a square abacus and a seemingly superimposed capital on the shaft, which contradict the monolithic nature of the construction by their formation. The steel frame, in our day, allows large openings to be bridged with slender beams. The building may stand 13 Goodyear, W. H., "Architectural Refinements in Early Byzantine Churches and French Cathedrals," The Architectural Record (August, 1904), and "Architectural Refine- ments in Italian Churches" American Journal of Archaeology, Second Series, Journal of the Archaeological Institute of America, VI: 2, (1902).</page><page sequence="15">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 33 on piles, and its exterior walls form a kind of skin wall or envelope of space. The facade, therefore, obviously should no longer be treated as in classical architec- ture, with base, trunk, and crown, which require a heavier lower section. Con- versely, the upper part can now afford to be heavier, as in Chinese buildings; it may even project and, fixed on piles, will appear to float in space. Of course, this sort of modern architecture employs abstract forms; a combination of lines and surfaces, in which the material seems to have shed its weight.'4 Nonetheless, the spectator will not feel that gravity has been conquered, unless he is moved by the grace of the form. The most daring combinations in the construction will not produce such grace, without refinement of the form itself. Let us call to mind the sculpture in low relief in Olympia, where Hercules is depicted as trying to carry the burden of heaven's dome. Athena helps him with her left hand, giving the impression that she could as easily have borne all the rest of the burden on that one hand. To her, as a goddess, the effort is negligible, and saves Hercules from just that final, supreme effort that, one feels, would have crushed him. Optical refinements may well be compared to that slight, that negligible but effective touch of Athena's hand, as they reveal through the archi- tectural forms the force of the mind overcoming the gravity of matter. 3. Deviations of Form in Picturesque Style and their Value It was shown in the previous part that optical corrections in architecture, far from being mere illusions, or designed to produce fictitious scenic effects, are in fact the expression of a finer artistic feeling. They are refinements, means towards the perfection of form, designed to suggest certain subtle qualities conceived in a broader vision, which formal reason and geometrical accuracy are not enough to express. The theory of their dependence on kinesthetic sensations of the eye muscles, or on any principles of perspective, was therefore rejected. Their appeal was sought rather in our innate sense of aesthetic mechanics (by which we in- tuitively appreciate the action of forces in a structure) and in our mental and psychological reactions to a work of art. Valid arguments have been brought forward against the value of such aesthetic empathy. But its importance can scarcely be denied, at least in architecture, the abstract nature of whose forms makes their appeal impersonal and far from a purely subjective or emotional experience. Moreover, thp unity in variety its patterns offer, and the intrinsic symbolism of its presentations, introduce ob- jective values. Thus the ideal form is suggested to the imagination of the spec- tator by the actual work, not as a cold intellectual construction, but as a living organism, a dynamic structure in the making, presented at the "fertile moment" as its whole scope is summed up in the real form. The column of a classical temple, for instance-like a statue given the effective attitude to suggest move- ment-beyond displaying mere support, suggests the action of forces that enable it to carry its burden effectively. Thus, seemingly surpassing the toil entailed, it becomes a free form, standing there in its own right. As it supports its burden 14 Loss of weight in this instance is material and not artistic. Artistic dematerialization was achieved by Byzantine architecture by abolishing projections, by piercing mass, by lighting, and by a lay-out that made its interior space seem infinite, though unified.</page><page sequence="16">34 P. A. MICHELIS effortlessly and gracefully, it contributes to the elevation of the whole temple, of which the scope is to proclaim itself the habitation of the gods. Incidentally, the same idea, repeated in each column throughout the temple, lends the com- position meaning and style. Recently, in Greece, Professor Romaios advanced a theory explaining not only the refinements of classical architecture, but also the irregularities of ancient sculpture.'6 Very careful observation showed him the Linea Alba of the couros to be curved and the frontality attributed to them by Lange to be fictitious. As Professor Romaios maintains, all archaic statues, despite their apparent stereo- metric regularity, are full of irregularities; yet, despite their indifference to anatomical proportions, they do not entirely ignore them, since they show ana- tomical differences in their figures of young and old. In architecture, also, Prof. Romaios observes, the roofing of the ancient temple, which was considered a soulless geometric construction, presents irregularities. Half the anthemia of the antefixae diverge (in relation to the axis of the building's sides) to the right, and half diverge to the left; moreover, they display a curvature and so reveal a third dimension. In archaic temples, these inclinations were originally due to the tech- nical demands of roofing. Yet they survived in the classical temples too, where they were no longer structurally essential, because (as Prof. Romaios maintains) their aesthetic value was appreciated. In the Parthenon, the same turn as in the antefixae is to be observed in the lions' heads in the gutters; in addition, the acroteria lean outwards. According to Vitruvius, indeed, the whole pediment does so. Prof. Romaios suggests that all these irregularities are manifestations of "latent movement," and he proceeds to explain why we find them pleasing. The lions' heads in the gutters, he tells us, rouse in the spectator two impres- sions simultaneously: that they both face him frontally, and are turned away (to right or left) as in fact they are. However, Prof. Romaios goes on, several impressions can exist simultaneously in the mind. The result of such simultaneous impressions is that, in the case of conflicting ones, the spectator's imagination breaks them up into a rhythmic alternation which is aesthetically pleasing. The curved line of the stylobate clashes with the spectator's assumption that it is in fact straight, with the result that his eye lends the curve length which emphasizes its upward movement. The contrast presented by curve and straight line is resolved in a rhythmic alternation, which rouses aesthetic pleasure. Nonetheless, it should seem that though our mind may be conscious of a variety of impressions simultaneously, it still demands a certain order in them and therefore subjects them to a certain gradation. Classifying its impressions into primary and secondary ones, the mind brings a certain unity in variety. That is an essential prerequisite, not only to grasping an impression, but also to its aesthetic appreciation. Moreover, the part played in our mind by the non- actual, purely imaginary attribute-say the straight line of the stylobate or the frontality of the lions' heads-is negative. We imagine we see these assumed properties-the straight line, or frontality not actually there-only while con- sciously thinking about what we are looking at, and not while aesthetically 's Professor Constantine Romaios' work in Greek, "Tiles of Calydon-A contribution to a more accurate contemplation of Greek art" (Greek Archaeological Society, 1951).</page><page sequence="17">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 35 moved by what we see. The comparison of curves with straight lines, if it takes place at all, ceases the moment we are aesthetically stirred. The reproduction, therefore, of contrasting impressions by the mind cannot be permanent; nor, in consequence, can their rhythmic alternations be permanent. Moreover, rhythm cannot be created by the alternation of an actual and a fictitious impression. A contrast of actual and fictitious may stimulate the intellect to an act of com- parison, but cannot be a source of heightened pleasure. The assertion of an actual curve where we had looked for a straight line would, in fact, disappoint us, if we are to accept Prof. Romaios' theory that our aesthetic pleasure is derived, not from the actual lines of the work, but from the contrast they offer to imagined ones. Now in an aesthetic approach to the work, the spectator does not vest its perpendicular and horizontal lines with geometric qualities, which they neither can, nor should, possess in his mind if it be uninfluenced. Verticality is to the spectator the direction of gravity; a direction which, as he knows it innately, enables him to appreciate a column's inclination, just as the builder assesses his building's angles, at a glance. By analogy, the horizontal line suggests rest or inertia-a quality which he also knows innately. That is why, on seeing the inclinations of columns, their diminution, entasis, and curves, we at once feel the action of the forces which determine these traits, without having first to compare the architectural parts with their geometrical counterparts-say, column with cylinder, or the temple with a cube,-as Romaios thinks. Such comparisons would only impair an aesthetic impression. Rhythm does not spring from such contrasts, but will spring from, say, the steps of the columns, the correspondingly multiple steps of the triglyphs, guttae, flutings, the rhythmic series of ornamental motifs-from elements which, repeated and differentiated, with variations, alternate and balance ever in harmonious proportions, so that the whole pattern they form is instinct with beauty. To explain logically the charm of the irregular bends of the antifixae, of curves, and of inclinations (as Romaios attempts to do) it is not necessary to compare them with other regular attitudes, or geometric lines. Their charm is at once explained if we accept their irregularity as a deliberate improvement-a hint of a broader vision, which in itself enhances as it gives a pattern its discreet character; for the very curves, bends, irregularities which enhance one pattern may be quite misplaced in another. In the Egyptian temple, we saw that the curves of the stylobate are not perpendicular, but horizontal, because the building as a whole does not seek to rise, as does the Parthenon; in the Sounion temple, again, we have no entasis in the columns. Art, however, in order to illustrate a subtle or abstruse concept, often discards a formally logical display of its elements; it often has recourse to inconsistencies in order to imply what it is impossible to express. The antifixa, for instance, by its inconsistent slight inclination to right or left, assumes a signifi- cance over and above that of its conventional part; it is now not merely an un- important member in the series of antifixae, but also a unique, though minor, crowning point for the temple. By its inclination, then, each antifixa acquires an added significance, which it lends to the whole series, making of it a free</page><page sequence="18">36 P. A. MICHELIS crown. By the same token, the stylobate, seen as a floor or as a base for the columns, would have to be horizontal; yet the curve which makes it incongruous as a stylobate, in resisting the pressure and weight of the columns, lends it a new status. It co-operates with the columns, thus borrowing some of their eminence as it contributes to the idea of elevation, proclaimed by all the carrying and carried members of the work. Moreover, Prof. Romaios's theory that the simultaneous impressions of a picture in the spectator's mind make him conscious, in their rhythmic alterna- tion, of latent movement in the work, does not show us the bounds beyond which irregularity here would not be tolerable. If the curved stylobate, for instance, took on the form of an arch, the columns would appear to be sliding over it. No doubt its failure could then be imputed to the fact that it no longer bore any relationship to its geometric counterpart, the straight line. But then, why should it not be related to the arch (also a geometric form) towards which it tends equally as much? For the curved stylobate, according to Prof. Romaios, fluctuates between the two contrasts offered by the straight line and the arch. It would seem then, that the bounds beyond which irregularity would defeat its own purpose, are set each time by the individual form, according to its signifi- cance in the whole; and that, wherever irregularity detracts from the scope of a form, it clashes with the whole and has exceeded the bounds of the tolerable, in which case, it loses all power of expression. Were this standard lacking, then any random irregularity in execution, any miscalculation in a work of art would constitute a source of movement and a means of artistic expression-a thing which does not, in fact, occur. Finally, the latent movement observed in Greek classical architecture is a tendency inherent in all art and cannot be treated as a special feature of classical architecture, by which to explain its other peculiarities. Without the suggestion of movement, there can be no art even when that art is, as in the case of archi- tecture, static by nature. The only special characteristic of movement in classical architecture is its restraint. Yet, whatever our differences with Prof. Romaios's theory, we owe him a debt of gratitude as an archeologist; for after a painstaking study of details which none had examined before him, he has proved that ir- regularity in archaic roofing, originally adopted for technical reasons, was re- tained in the classical temple for its aesthetic appeal. In other words, the classical style, far from ceding to dry mathematical regularity, deliberately preserved a tradition of free design. Moreover, by relating these irregular forms to those of archaic sculpture (where they had for the most part occurred unwittingly in execution) Prof. Romaios has bridged the gulf between deliberate and accidental irregularities in architecture. Thus, although we may go as far as to accept that certain irregularities in classical architecture-such as the column's diminution- originally arose out of technical reasons, and that their aesthetic appeal was appreciated only subsequently; even though we go as far as to accept that all were adopted directly, though unwittingly, as means of artistic expression, we may not for a moment regard them as ossified optical illusions perpetuated by classical architecture for the elimination of other optical illustions and the restoration of straight lines.</page><page sequence="19">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 37 It was Goodyear'6 who first ventured to associate the irregularity which archaic temples present in the intercolumnia of the pteron with the irregularity in cor- responding parts of classical temples, and to suggest that in the latter, the gradual narrowing of the intercolumnia towards the corners is little more than a "systematic irregularity." The narrowing, he maintains, is not disturbing, because the intercolumnia, seen perspectively, in any case appear unequal and, indeed, the more narrow the further away they are. The actual narrowing towards the corners, however, causes "confusion of the eye," which is aesthetically pleasing. The curves and other forms of irregularity, he tells us, have a similar effect, and should not, therefore, be regarded as optical corrections (as Vitruvius suggests) but as the refinements of a "temperamental" architecture. The theory that aesthetic appeal is achieved by "optical vibration, or confusion of the eye," is obviously not a very happy one, even though it originates in Ruskin. Goodyear, however, as a romantic, believed that the regularity and mathematical accuracy for which the mature classical architecture strove, had destroyed the forceful feeling of archaic architecture. In any case, he revealed the fact that the tradition of irregularities, or of refinements, was perpetuated in Eastern and Western medieval architecture up to the Renaissance. Goodyear's association of the various forms of irregularity was of course fairly external, for he did not take into account the various styles which create irregularities of a different species each time. Nevertheless, he recognizes that they all belong to the same genus-a fact to which no attention has since been paid, and which we shall now attempt to analyze. The entasis of columns, the curves and other forms of irregularity in classical architecture, earlier discussed, are not constructional defects; they are more or less deliberate refinements of form, or systematic irregularities. Certain irregu- larities, however, do arise out of the builder's indifference to the regular shape, or even out of a sense of freedom which causes him to digress from the perfectly accurate form. Such irregularities are tolerable only in so far as they are artistic, not mere haphazard deformations, and so long as they do not depart from the spirit of the work. They are artistic if the part which displays them does not, in disgressing from the whole, cease to belong to it and if the irregularity does not go beyond the scope of the form which displays it. Irregularity, if it is to be happy, must not confuse the main direction of a line, upset proportions, or blur con- trasts which, if anything, it should enhance by its very digression from regu- larity and precision. Such irregularities are apparent in certain styles of dynamic architecture, like the medieval, which may, therefore, be described as picturesque. Byzantine architecture is full of such irregularities. Not a single wall may be said to form a right angle with its adjoining wall; not a single dome is absolutely circular at its base, the joints are never of equal dimensions or absolutely straight, the ornamental motifs are irregular, and plaques are asymmetricially placed. A facile way, frequently employed, to explain this peculiarity is to attribute it to lack of skill, and to an inferior art which, incapable of effecting refinements, perforce produced such distorted forms. But this argument is refuted by the fact 16Goodyear, Wm. Henry, Greek Refinements, Studies in Temperamental Architecture, Oxford University Press (1912).</page><page sequence="20">38 P. A. MICHELIS that any attempt to introduce regularity of form in restoring Byzantine archi- tecture, or in constructing neo-Byzantine buildings, results in divesting them of their peculiar charm. It seems, then, that Byzantine architecture demands this sort of refinement, by which it acquires the picturesque character that pertains to its style. The Byzantine style may be said to eschew regularity and precision. No matter how little premeditated or fore-planned its irregularities, it not only tolerates them as they may emerge in the course of construction, but indeed seems to demand them; for they promote its main quality-the feeling of artistic freedom it intensely suggests. Conversely, one of the charms of classical architecture is its tendency to pre- cision and regularity. Here, too, whenever the tendency was exaggerated in imitations, they completely lost the peculiar quality of the original classical work; not unnaturally, since, as we have seen, the classical style is not the product of a geometrical conception. There is a hint of dynamism there, too, which be- comes evident in the refinements we have mentioned. These refinements express the fertile moment of the work's action, convey its essence, elevating the forms as they introduce a spiritual quality there, and finally bringing to the spectator that feeling of artistic freedom, imperative in aesthetic appreciation and creation. In the classical style too, then, we have a latent picturesqueness, which we detect again in the unequal intercolumnia of archaic temples; in their columns with various capitals and of varying diameters-irregularities which, as they emerged at random in the course of construction, were adopted by the archaic temple for their picturesqueness, and later systematized in the classical temple, in its general tendency to acquire increasing regularity and precision. Picturesque- ness was thus subdued in the classical temple and became a latent quality in an architecture eminently plastic or tectonic. In referring to classical architecture, therefore, it would be more correct to speak of "latent picturesqueness," than of "latent movement," which is common to all arts. Picturesqueness in classical architecture is not as subdued as is generally supposed, or as might at first sight appear. Certain parts where it manifests itself, as unexpectedly as clearly, are indicated below: 1) In the anthemia of the antifixae, the acroteria and other ornamental parts of the temple, which not only show inclinations and bends but, as Prof. Romaios observes, are also not absolutely regular in themselves. Though they appear to us to have been designed with a pair of compasses, they are in fact extraordinarily free. Here is an instance of irregularities in execution -brought in keeping with the classical style. 2) In polychromy, which also lends a tone of picturesqueness to the classical work, as it eliminates the cold marmoreal whiteness of the surface and any marked delineation in architecture. It animates abstract figures into concrete forms, as it brings the vividness of color there; it expands and unifies, as it gives them character, and finally, blends them with the natural scenery. Of course, the colors of classical architecture are unnatural, but as a whole, they make up an harmonious pattern that is, moreover, free of any naive realistic imitation. Romaios, in fact, distinguished in the polychromy of the ornaments a principle</page><page sequence="21">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 39 systematically maintained throughout (as the colors range from black to red) which lends movement and direction to the decoration.'7 3) Now, besides the decorative elements, picturesqueness manifests itself also in the unit-such as the Erechtheum-where symmetry is not absolute and the building was designed to conform with the natural formation of the ground. But where picturesqueness is particularly evident in classical architecture is in the planning of such groups of buildings as the Acropolis, or Delphi. These groups are not "closed," so as to form geometric squares with the build- ings running on all four sides of them, as in the case of St. Mark's Square in Venice. They are, on the contrary, "open," so that the buildings seem to be placed independently of an axis of symmetry and to be so well adjusted to the formation of the ground that, far from interfering with it, they in fact show it off to ad- vantage; they enhance it. As a rule, they project diagonally towards the spec- tator, and so the sides of the buildings lean towards or away from, one another, allowing the gaps in between to close optically wherever their lines meet, or to remain open at infinity. Consequently, there is no trace here, of any-at least more than negligible-leveling of ground, of regular spacing, or of monotonous symmetry. Even in the Hippodamian town-plan, we may detect traces of free design; for the symmetry and regularity displayed in its volumes and forms are dynamic, not formal. 4) Finally, the purest manifestation of picturesqueness in ancient Greek architecture is to be found in its urban buildings. Already in the prehistoric age, the ground plans of both rectangular and curved buildings show movement in the division of their areas. In the classical era, again, the ground plan of the ordinary dwelling is irregular; asymmetry abounds and we have a free arrangement of doors and windows and bay-windows which recall the Byzantine. Such buildings, which incidentally survive in Delos, are recalled by the average humble dwelling in present-day Greece. Byzantine architecture, which introduced this picturesqueness in its monu- mental architecture, may be said to have adopted the popular architecture of antiquity, bridging its voids with arches and roofing over its interior areas with domes; otherwise the design is unchanged, retaining its freedom from the austere rhythmical order of ancient religious architecture. It remains, in other words, distinctly picturesque. It was only in the Renaissance that the austere rhythmic order was re-introduced in the fashionable buildings, the spacious palazzi of the nobles; when the gods were brought down to our planet, and sublime religious art became mundane. That era saw the return of regularity and conventionality, 17 Half the decoration, Romaios maintains, is directed to the right and the other half to the left, in relation to the axis of the lateral facades. Here, the inclinations of antifixae and of lions heads, as well as the direction of the motifs, separate thanks to the Corinthian innovation of employing two pediments for the roof; for formerly, one of the narrow sides of the temple was crowned with a cap. Now the importance of the Corinthian innovation surely lies elsewhere, to wit: in the fact that the temple thus acquired two fagades or, rather, was wholly converted into a facade, as it assumed the form of a monument, and became important as such, independently of its function as a temple.</page><page sequence="22">40 P. A. MICHELIS which had prevailed over Roman, but never over Greek, art, and which now almost effaced the restrained picturesqueness of classical architecture. What, finally, is the main principle of picturesqueness and what that of plasticity?'8 Classical architecture constructs on the principle of beam upon post, where there is only pressure and bending acting perpendicularly. There are practically no thrusts. It builds dry, using no cohesive material, so that its parts balance with one another, mainly by gravitation, and can be detached from one another. Outwardly, every member appears self-sufficient, as it detaches itself plastically from the rest and associates with secondary parts, themselves self-sufficient, so that the whole composition shows a democratic order. Medieval architecture, on the contrary, builds with vaults and buttresses, introduces side thrusts, uses cohesive material, and treats its constructions as monolithic. The parts of the work, so to speak, flow into one another, and Gothic architecture went as far as to display traction in the hanging key-stones of its ribbed barrel vaults. Out- wardly, then, the self-sufficiency of the members here becomes ineffective before the cohesiveness of the mass. The composition shows a despotic order with all the parts subordinated to the whole, so that they seem impossible to detach, as though amalgamated. Their individuality is vitiated, ceding to the unity of the whole. Thus, in classical monuments, the forms project as completely plastic; each seems to expand as it adheres to another, and they are linked each to each through the parts that divide them; whereas in the Byzantine the forms lose their entity, the projections are weak, the decoration is in low relief and the whole mass unfolds in two dimensions. The sense of statics in us responds differently in each case. In the plastic forms, where the action of the forces is perpendicular, we look for elevation; in the picturesque forms, where it is distributed throughout the mass, we seek de- materialization. Our aesthetic approach, also, differs in each case. In the plastic forms, which stand out as self-sufficient in a composition, we seek restrained movement and clearly defined proportions; in the picturesque forms, which merge into a characteristic unity, we expect dynamism and marked expression. The plastic work gives the impression of being complete; the picturesque of con- tinuous evolution, and of a transitional expression of its ideal form. Here, art seems to construct its works as nature does her creations-sacrificing the indi- vidual to the kind. Its deviations from exactness are imperceptible perfections, which its picturesque style demands. Nonetheless, medieval architecture, eminently picturesque as its compositions are, is not wholly devoid of plasticity, or of a relative autonomy and differenti- ation of its parts. In it we find columns supporting arches, arches supporting domes, and other parts acquiring a relative autonomy in the composition- indeed, without such autonomy, there would be no composition. In the same way classical architecture, which is eminently plastic, is not wholly devoid of pictur- esqueness; it tends to conceal the joints of the masonry, and dresses its parts so 18 The distinction drawn by Woifflin between linear and painterly in connection with Renaissance and Baroque art concerns outward form, and does not correspond with the present distinction.</page><page sequence="23">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 41 that its mass appears continuous and elastic. The idea of continuity of surface and unity of composition at once make it obvious that irregularity in the parts of the composition is never casual, but very much part of the whole design, differentiated rhythmically throughout. The column is diminished as is the whole temple. In the classical composition, however, with its tendency to precision and regularity-combined with that democratic ordering of parts which enhances the self-sufficiency of each-irregularities, arising in the course of construction, are limited to the minimum in the completed work and any deviation allowed is given a clear, regular form. Picturesqueness is thus subordinated in the classical work and becomes a latent quality. The conception of the fitting form, therefore, is different in each art. The classical style strives for completeness in the concrete form, viewing it as the only ideal imitation of the archetype. In order to achieve such ideal imitation, precision and regularity are essential, even where deviation is displayed. That is why the curve of the stylobate becomes the part of an arch;19 the section of the echinus, almost a hyperbola.20 The merit of the classical style, in other words, very largely depends on the right proportions of its parts-in fact, to the extent of lending these proportions eminence in themselves. At the beginning of a new era, however, which reached its peak in Byzantine art, Plotinus laid down another aesthetic principle. The unity of a work of art, he said, does not depend so much on right color and on good proportions, as on the idea it reflects; it is the idea which lends it unity. Thus the parts can afford to lose their self-suffi- ciency, and may allow asymmetry and irregularities in execution. The whole now grows like the tree from its seed, where not the proportions of the branches, but their articulation and characteristic traits are the things that matter. Conse- quently, the form in this type of art is nothing if not the expression of a content, to which its transitory and temporary nature more easily guides the spectator. Classical art strives for the expression of abstract beauty; medieval art, of char- acteristic beauty. The former, no matter how highly individual its work, at the same time idealizes it, subsuming it under an archetype. The latter, no matter the degree to which its work may represent a concept-and in medieval art the concept is invariably of a transcendental nature-the work is characterized by individual peculiarities. Thus, in the picturesque style, the very irregularities are a characteristic element of its individuality. They are like the numerous lines of a sketch from which the spectator must choose the one which most approaches the perfect. His imagination is thus stimulated to a more vivid vision of an ideal form, than it could attain by the display of perfection-as illustrated in the classical form 19 The eminent mathematician, Karatheodori, in an article in the 1937 issue of the Archae- ological Journal in Athens (pp. 120-4) maintains that the lines of the stylobate are sectors with radii of 1850 m. and 5561 m., and no parabolas, as Penrose supposed, since in the fifth century conic sections were unknown. However, it is far more likely that the curve was introduced without reference to the circle's radius. 20 The tendency to reduce sections of curves to geometrically accurate or strictly de- fined lines, like the parabola or hyperbola, begins in the age of Pericles, until, with the decline, the sense of form was lost and the echinus, for instance, was presented as a straight line.</page><page sequence="24">42 P. A. MICHELIS which arrests the imagination in itself, by the austere beauty of its outline. The picturesque form seems to be ever reaching out for precision; its irregu- larities appear as approximations to the ideal, and not as refinements of the real, form. But since they strive towards, and not away from, the ideal form, far from distorting it, they in fact suggest it by emphasizing its main points and its pri- mary tendencies; they fit into their forms discreetly, so that the part does not destroy the whole. They thus lead towards a conception of the beautiful form. They are, in fact, negative refinements in that, unlike the positive refinements of classical architecture which complete the actual form, these move away from it. However, since the ideal form can never be realized absolutely, even in the classical form, which proclaims it directly, no sharp distinction can be drawn between positive and negative refinements. This means that between refine- ments there is no difference of genus, but only of species. They cease to exist in the strict geometric form, which admits of no refinement, and is artistically neutral. Of course, certain irregularities in Byzantine architecture are positive refine- ments, since certain of its forms are plastic. For instance, the columns show en- tasis; in order to enhance the arch, its center is raised over the imposts; or, in the case of the central vault, of the trilobed archways, it is made wider or more narrow in order to distinguish it. Further, if we are to believe Goodyear, the nave's walls lean outwards in order to breathe freely; finally, the fagade of St. Mark is curved. But, in the Byzantine style, plastic articulation and differ- entiation of parts are not its predominant characteristics. Here it is the pictur- esque unity of the parts which predominates, as these become the organs of a deeper dynamic tendency. The form is vitiated and it is the content which is now enhanced and towards which the whole work points. That is why, in this type of architecture, space and light become primary elements. As Schelling has observed, if classical art aimed at enclosing the infinite in the finite, medieval art aimed at the reverse-to make of the finite an allegory of the infinite. In the aesthetic contemplation of a classical or a medieval work, the ideal form must inevitably be re-created in imagination, since perfection is not to be abso- lutely realized in the visible, concrete, symbol. A gap inevitably separates the real from the ideal. A work of art must guide the imagination towards the ideal form, by suggesting its perfection and so enabling the mind to grasp its inexpres- sible qualities. After a mental vision of the ideal form, and his comparison of it with the real, the spectator derives profound pleasure. No matter the degree to which the ideal form excels the real in perfection, the actual form excels the ideal as its realization in matter. The desire to realize is an incentive to human creation. In the inevitable mental comparison between vision and reality, when con- templating a work of art, the imagination does not compare the real form with an intellectual geometric pattern, but with an ideal projection of the concrete pattern it notices. That is why the mind can tolerate the ravages of time in a work of art, its imperfections, its irregularities, all of which are often an aid to the imagination, compelling it to complete the ideal form for itself, to recreate it, or, according to Plato's theory of "reminiscence," to evoke its archetype. Our profoundest joy in the aesthetic contemplation of a work springs, perhaps, not</page><page sequence="25">REFINEMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE 43 from the feeling that we are making the acquaintance of a new form, but from our recognition of an ideal form of which we had always-though not actively- been aware, and which we find here expressed. Be that as it may, the dialectical rhythm set up in the imagination by a mental comparison between ideal and real form is not the result of the purely intellectual process of comparing the real with a geometric form. For it is only imagination that can bring us a vision of perfection through the world of imperfection and allow the work of art to suggest that the imperfect can in fact realize the perfect. This transition and return of the imagination to and from the actual work and its ideal vision rouses continuous surprise and aesthetic pleasure, as the mind becomes conscious of its freedom to realize its vision through the boundaries of reality. The work of art becomes, then, the bridge between necessity and freedom, as Hegel said. In thus comparing the display of irregularities in classical and medieval styles, we have attempted to show that, despite different manifestations, art is basically governed by the same principles, of which now these, now those, are emphasized. The difference is merely one of emphasis, in which no principle is ever eliminated but only subordinated. It was further shown that, in the case of classical art, the quality that is subordinated and latent is picturesqueness-not movement, which is universally latent in all styles. A study of the medieval style will assist us to a fuller understanding of the classical, and vice versa, only if we do not attempt in our comparison, to apply the ideals of the one to the other.</page></plain_text>
