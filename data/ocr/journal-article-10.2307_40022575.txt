The University of Australia, Nedlands, Australia Pantheists are bound to find the fact of evil (and especially moral evil) an enormous embarrassment. It is difficult enough to square this fact with belief in an omnipotent and infinitely loving Creator. It is much more difficult to square it with the view that an evil world is an actual expression of God's perfect nature. H.P. Owen (1971)1 Introduction I shall argue that the problem of evil is a theistic one that is not directly pertinent to pantheism. It is not 'an embarrassment' to pantheists, nor can it be since pantheism rejects all aspects of theism essential to generating the problem. This thesis conflicts with the common view among Spinoza's earliest critics that pantheism, unlike theism, cannot account for evil.2 I contend that the reason for claiming pantheism cannot account for evil usually rests on a conflation of pantheism with monism, and the even more untoward supposition that the pantheist's 'God' (i.e. the all-inclusive divine Unity) is theistic in important respects. I am not claiming that pantheism need not address the existence of evil and associated moral issues. It offers both its own formulation(s) of a 'problem of evil' and its own responses. However, the very idea of evil may be something the pantheist wishes to eschew. 'Evil' is essentially a metaphysical rather than a moral concept; or a moral concept with a particular theistic metaphysical commitment. The pantheist may prefer, as most contemporary ethical theorists do, to talk of what is morally or ethically right and wrong. If the term 'evil' is retained it must be divorced from its original theological and metaphysical context. Before returning to some of the reasons theists give for why pantheism is allegedly unable to cope with evil, it is necessary to examine the problem of evil as conceived in its theistic context. I also briefly examine</page><page sequence="2">130 some proposed solutions (i.e. theodicies) to the problem as it is theistically conceived. (A theodicy is a vindication of God's perfect goodness despite the evil that exists in the world.3) My purpose in doing so is not to prove that theistic responses to the problem are necessarily inadequate. I merely want to show there is a prima facie case for supposing theism cannot adequately resolve its problem of evil, while also showing evil is definitely not the problem for pantheists that remarkably theists have claimed it is. After examining the theistic problem of evil and proposed theodicies, the applicability of prominent theistic theodicies to pantheism will be questioned and rejected. This will not show that pantheism is at a logical disadvantage compared to theism in attempting to make sense of evil. Rather, theistic theodicies fail to apply to pantheism because pantheism dispenses both with the problem of evil itself and the need for a proposed solution. 1. Evil is mysterious Although there are classical theistic doctrines of both Creation and Evil that attempt to 'explain' and account for them in some way, these are the most prominent issues that theism designates as 'mystery'. We cannot know all there is to know, or what we would like to know, about creation and evil. The theistic view is that basic problems associated with these doctrines are cognitively impenetrable. Even revelation does not satisfac- torily explain creation or evil; although the hope associated with theism is that in a life after death the mystery may disappear. Assigning the status of 'mystery' to evil is the principle point of the story of Job. If God's response to Job, whirlwind and all, is regarded as solution to the problem of evil, or an explanation as to why evil befell Job, the point of the story is lost. Interestingly, God refers to creation in his response to Job and intimates that the mystery associated with it carries over, or is similar, to the lack of understanding Job shows with regard to his situation. Job is at a loss, and classical theism's view is that he is necessarily at a loss. From the human point of view there is no adequate explanation. It is a mystery. The same point is made by Dostoyevsky in The Brothers Karamazov. What Ivan is telling Alyosha is that there can be no intelligible reason why some evils that occur do occur given God's existence. He is rejecting theodicy per se. Ivan wants not just a logically possible explanation for evil, but some plausible explanation. And he sees the lack of any plausible explanation as grounds for rejecting a meaningful possibility that there is one.</page><page sequence="3">131 That theism itself regards evil as penultimately mysterious is often overlooked by those who think that evil is, for example, simply to be explained in terms of the free will which human beings have and which an omnibenevolent God gave us. That evil is and remains a problem in this life is central to classical theism. Those who attribute it to the devil, in the case of physical evil, or free will in the case of persons, disregard the nature and character of the problem as it is seen within an important strand of classical (and biblical) theism. Alvin Plantinga denies that the Free Will Defence (discussed below) to the problem of evil is a theodicy. But the Defence is generally not meant, as Plantinga claims, simply as an argument for the compatibility of God's goodness with moral evil in the world. Even for Plantinga it serves as an explanation for evil. He says, St. Augustine believes that natural evil ... is in fact to be ascribed to the activity of beings that are free and rational but non-human [i.e. devils]. [This is a theodicy and opposed to a defence.] The Free Will Defender, on the other hand, need not assert that this is true; he says only that it is possible ... He points to the possibility that natural evil is due to the actions of significantly free but non-human persons. We have noted the possibility that God could not have actualised a world with a better balance of moral good over moral evil than this one displays. Some- thing similar holds here. . .4 The natural reading of the Free Will Defence is to see it as an explanation of why God allows evil, and how despite the evil he remains perfectly good. The free Will Defence is a theodicy. And since it is offering an explanation cum justification for evil it is a classical misrepresentation of the nature of the problem. Thus, Plantinga is engaged in theodicy and his engagement is of a type that some theists find fundamentally flawed - that of finding a rational justification for evil. He is an example of contem- porary theists that disregard the nature of the problem of evil as tradition- ally conceived.5 It will be shown that for the pantheist evil need not be regarded as a mystery. People freely commit 'eivl' (i.e. do the morally wrong thing) and are responsible for it. But there is nothing cognitively impenetrable about this. The pantheist does not need to account for the fact of evil in view of an essential supposition concerning God's (or the Unity's) perfect good- ness. And it is only this needing to * account for' or explain evil that generates the sense of mystery associated with evil for the theist. For some theists it may generate hopelessness more than mystery (e.g. Ivan).</page><page sequence="4">132 2. Theism's problem with evil The classical problem of evil concerns the alleged incompatibility between the existence of an omniscient, omnipotent and perfect good God with the existence of evil in the world. Is it possible for a morally perfect God who is omnipotent and omniscient to allow evil? Alternatively, the problem may be posed in terms of what is probable. Is it probable that God would allow such evils if he existed?6 The logical argument from evil against the existence of God claims the theist is committed to the following proposi- tions: (1) God is omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good; (2) God would prevent all preventable evil; (3) The world contains preventable evil. The argument alleges that these three propositions are inconsistent.7 If God is perfectly good then he would prevent any evil that is prevent- able. Given that God is perfectly good, omnipotent and omniscient, he should prevent (preventable) evil. But there is evil in the world and it does not appear to be logically unpreventable - indeed some of it we prevent ourselves. Therefore the existence of God is incompatible with the existence of evil and God cannot exist if evil does. The empirical argu- ment from evil claims that evil makes it highly unlikely that a theistic God exists.8 Much of the argument is based on what is meant by preventable evil and what a perfectly good God would allow. Would God permit evil that is required for a greater good, rather than preventing all evil? Can God prevent all evil (e.g. by not creating anything)? Must God create the best of all possible worlds even if such a world contained evil? Or would a perfectly good God not allow any evil - even if it meant creating nothing? In not allowing evils which are logically required for a greater good, is God allowing a greater evil than necessary? Perhaps God's perfect goodness requires that any and all evil will be permitted if it is required for a greater good. What constitutes a 'greater good' anyway? These are some of the complexities involved in the problem. The most immediate way out of the problem in either its logical or empirical form is to deny the truth of one of the premises.9 Thus, it has at times been denied that there really is evil in the world or that it is logically preventable.10 Sometimes, it is argued that evil is necessary for a greater good, and so a perfectly good God would not prevent all preventable evil, but only evil not resulting in foreseeable greater good. By preventing certain evils God could thereby be allowing the occurrence of greater evils, and this is something, it is claimed, God would not do. The Free Will Defence is a version of this kind of argument. 'Vale of soul-making' theodicies are also versions of this kind of argument.11 God could have created us so that our souls were 'already</page><page sequence="5">133 made'. However, this theodicy claims it is 'better' that we 'make our souls' and freely choose to relate to God, even if this results in evil. A relationship entered into as the result of God coercing us would be less valuable than one we sought to establish even though evil results from our having this freedom. A greater good allegedly results from God allowing individuals the freedom to develop in such a way that their doing evil, or even being unjust victims of it, is not precluded. People can only achieve full spiritual development by living life complete with its evils, vicis- situdes, pains and joys. Although Hick defends this theodicy he also calls attention to obvious difficulties. He says, '. . .so far as we can see, the soul- making process does in fact fail in our worn world at least as often as it succeeds'.12 Hick's estimate is optimistic and this theodicy, although half- lovely, is wholly unconvincing. Is it probable that the evils in this world, moral and physical, can each be traced back to a necessary role they play in the preparation of a soul? If there are any (let alone many) evils that cannot be accounted for in this way the theodicy fails. The Free Will Defence is the argument most often employed to counter the logical argument from evil. I shall discuss it briefly before turning back to pantheism and evil. The Free Will Defence claims that a world which contains free human beings capable of choosing between good and evil, and who sometimes choose to do evil but freely perform more good than evil, is on the whole more valuable than a world in which there is no freeedom of choice and also no evil. According to the Defence, the reason for moral evil is basically freedom. The world is 'better' if it has free human beings capable of doing evil, but who do more good that evil, than if there were no freedom - and so no evil. It is possible that moral evil is necessary if we are to have the amount of moral good in the world that we do have. If it were possible to create human beings so that we always freely chose to do the good, then it would be possible to have a world with as much moral good in it as this one has without also having moral evil. But, according to Plantinga, we cannot be created to always freely choose to do the good.13 Being free we are not compelled to do evil, but neverthe- less we freely do evil. It is possible that we always freely chose to do the good (i.e., we are not compelled to do evil), but in fact we do not always choose good over evil. Plantinga states the Free Will Defence (minus some complications) as follows: A world containing creatures who are sometimes significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but he cannot cause or determine them to do what is only right. For if he does so, then they are not significantly free after all; they do not do what is right freely. To create creatures capable</page><page sequence="6">134 of moral good, therefore, he must create creatures capable of moral evil; and he cannot leave these creatures free to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so ... The heart of the Free Will Defence is the claim that it is possible that God could not have created a universe containing moral good (or as much moral good as this one contains) without creating one containing moral evil.14 Would not a better world contain creatures like ourselves (or ourselves) who because of their natures did not choose any (or as much) evil as they do? Is not this the world that God, if he existed, would have created? Is such a restriction in terms of our natures a serious impediment to freedom? And even if it is, why is it not worth it overall? Contrary to J.L. Mackie and Anthony Flew, Plantinga argues that it is not possible for God to create free human beings who always freely choose to do the good.15 He argues against 'compatibilism' - the position which maintains the com- patibility between causal determinism and free will.16 According to compatibilism God could causally determine us always to freely choose the good. God could create us with natures such that, given those natures, we were free to do evil but always chose not to. If on one occasion we can chose to do the good freely why can't we always choose to do the good freely? Plantinga sees the idea of God creating us with natures such that, because of those natures, we never choose to do evil as a serious restriction on human freedom. Let us grant it is a restriction on human freedom. It is implausible to suppose tht God would not have chosen (been morally required) to create us with that kind of limitation on our freedom. After all, no matter what kind of nature we have there are limitations that go with it. Suppose that God created us with 'better' natures than we do have. If this would have been a restriction on human freedom, then it is unclear that we should not have been created with such restrictions. Suppose we had much worse natures, morally speaking, than we in fact have. God could have instead created us (i.e., less moral versions of us) with those (worse) natures, but he did not.17 Should the fact that we are morally better than what could have been the case be taken as a restriction on our freedom? Suppose given the limitation on what makes a 'nature' a 'human' nature God could not have created us so that with such natures, we always 'freely' choose to do the good. Is it implausible to suppose God oculd have made us with slightly better (i.e. morally better) natures than we do have? If it is a restriction on free will, is it plausible to maintain that God should not have so restricted us? Plantinga fails to show that 'it is possible that God could not [my emphasis] have created a universe containing moral good ... without creating one containing moral evil'; and he fails for reasons similar to those of why one cannot show conclusively that it is possible that God</page><page sequence="7">135 could create a universe containing moral good without creating one also containing moral evil. In this case it is not clear what is and what is not possible. Plantinga may seem right about the 'possibility' he speaks of because one can always imagine that whatever evil there is such evil might be necessary for a greater good. How can one prove that it is not possible that the evil is required for the greater good? If free will is regarded as of maximum value, or close to it, and free will is taken as incompatible, or factually incongruous, with humans always freely choosing to do the good, then whatever evil is performed can always be taken as necessary to, or promoting, a greater good - namely free will. In this case imagination is a poor test of coherence. The 'possibility' Plantinga argues on behalf of must be tested against the 'possibility' of a state of affairs with which it is inconsistent; a state of affairs such that if it were possible it would show that Plantinga must be mistaken in what he argues is possible. Plantinga claims to have refuted the possibility of just such a state of affairs in an argument against a view held by Mackie and Flew. He argues that com- patibilism is essential to their view, and that compatibilism is incoherent. But is he right? Mackie and Flew argue that if it is logically possible for humans to freely choose the good on one occasion, then (a) it is logically possible that they can freely choose to do the good on every occasion, and (b) God could have created them so that they always freely choose to do the good. Leaving Mackie and Flew aside for the moment, it is not clear that this view requires compatibilism. No mention is being made of God 'causally determining' how people choose. It might be possible that given how humans were created (i.e. their natures), they freely choose to do the right thing and could choose otherwise on every occasion. Whenever one acts one always acts in accordance with one's nature and so it might be claimed that every action is unfree if 'acting in accordance with one's nature' means that one's actions are always causally determined. In general, 'acting in accordance with one's nature' does not imply that one's actions are causally determined. Indeed, it is more natural to suppose that one is causally determined when one is acting out of character - i.e., not in accordance with one's nature. However, even if the Mackie/Flew view does rest on compatibilism it is not clear that compatibilism is false. If I have a certain nature (e.g. a totally good one) and act in accordance with it, then even if I am causally determined to act that way given my nature, why is that necessarily a restriction on my free will? I am acting in accordance with my nature and choosing to do so. I might even be seen as being more free (i.e. - not constrained by evil impulses). In short, it seems possible that humans could have been created so tht they always freely choose to do the good, and this does not obviously</page><page sequence="8">136 entail that one is causally determined to do the good. But even if it does entail causal determination, it is not clear that such determinism rules out free will. And of course it neither entails nor suggests that a perfectly good God would not have put certain constraints on what human beings are 'free' to do. Theodicy requires more than merely showing that God's goodness is logically compatible with the evil that exists in the world.18 It involves a justification of such goodness in the light of evil - where 'justification' involves more than showing the logical consistency of there existing evil and God. Job and Dostoyevsky's Ivan could care less about the logical consistency of the position. The question of consistency can be no more than a prolegomena to a theodicy. Plantinga (and Adams) seem concerned not with just showing the consistency of believing in God's goodness despite the existence of evil - but also in justifying God's goodness despite the evil. In doing so they misunderstand Job and trivialise the problem.19 Job's problem was that he could see not justification for the evil that befell him - not that he took it to be inconsistent with God's moral perfection. Job's rejection of free will as grounds for his misfortune is implicit in the story.20 What troubles Job is that he does not see how God could have allowed the misfortune to befall him and still be the perfect being he takes him to be. What bothers Job is not whether the existence of evil is compatible with God's existence. Job knows that God exists. What bothers him is his inability to reconcile God's goodness with the evil. I have claimed that efforts to prove that it is logically possible that evil is necessary for a greater good, are inconclusive. If free will is regarded as incompatible with God having created us always to choose to do the good, and is valued so that the possession of it outweighs whatever value there might be in constraining it, then it is logically possible that no matter what the evil is, as long as it is freely done, it is a morally better world with it than without it. The arguments are inconclusive, but assuming it is lo- gically possible that evil is necessary for a greater moral good, then God's perfect goodness entails that he must allow rather than prevent them. Given that the Free Will Defence against the logical argument from evil cannot conclusively be shown mistaken, the empirical argument seems to be the more useful one. One who employs an argument from evil against God's existence will not be troubled by the move from the logical to the empirical argument since the alleged logical possibility that evil is required for a greater good remains for them merely a possibility. It suffices that some evil seems so unnecessary, that it is not just psychologi- cally impossible to believe it is required for a greater good, but epistemi- cally unjustified.21</page><page sequence="9">137 3. Pantheism and the theistic problem of evil Given the classical argument from evil in either its logical or empirical versions it is surprising anyone should think evil presents a problem for the pantheism; for example, that evil counts against the existence of the pantheistic Unity similar to the way it counts against the existence of the theistic God. Evil might be taken to be indicative of a lack of pantheistic Unity, as evidence of some kind of chaos instead. But it cannot count against the pantheistic Unity as it does against the theistic God. Given the following propositions the argument from evil states that it is either impossible or (more plausibly) improbable that God exists. (1) God is omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good; (2) God would prevent all preventable evil; (3) The world contains preventable evil. The pantheist accepts (3) 'The world contains preventable evil'. The pantheist also accepts that if there was a theistic God, which for the pantheist ex hypothesi there is not, then (2) 'God would prevent prevent- able evil'. But the pantheist rejects (1) 'God is omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good', and that is the proposition needed to generate the problem to begin with. According to the pantheist, there is undeniably evil in the world that could be prevented, and supposing there were a theistic God one would assume he would prevent it. But since thee is no such God why suppose that proposition (3) requires a special explanation or is cause for any conceptual or spiritual malaise on the part of the pantheist - as it is for some theists? For all that has been said thus far, the existence of preventable evil, does not even constitute a prima facie reason for reject- ing either the probability of the existence of the pantheistic all-inclusive divine Unity, or the coherence of the notion. (3) is not incompatible with anything the pantheist believes to be true. It is not incompatible with (1) since the pantheist denies the truth of (1), and it is not incompatible with (2) which is only hypothetically true for the pantheist. The pantheist has no need either to explain evil, or to explain evil away - at least not in any wya resembling theism's need to do so. Evil may be a problem for the pantheist, but it is not the kind of problem that it is for the theist. It does not even conflict, prima facie with the existence of a divine Unity. Pantheism does not claim that the divine Unity is a 'perfect being' or a being at all (generally), or that it is omnis- cient etc. Surely it is mistaken to interpret Spinoza's 'God' as 'perfect' and 'omniscient' etc. in anything like the way these predicates are inter- preted theistically as applying to God. It might be supposed that the existence of evil is inconsistent or incongruous with the 'divinity' of the</page><page sequence="10">138 Unity. But this would have to be argued. In theism it is assumed that what is divine cannot also be (in part) evil. But why assume this is the case with pantheism? Even in Otto's account of the 'holy' the holy has a demonic aspect. At any rate, there is little reason for the pantheist to argue that what is divine can also be evil, since they can deny that evil falls within the purview of the divine Unity. To say that everything that exists constitutes a divine Unity (i.e. pantheism's essential claim) need not be interpreted so that it entails that all parts and every aspect of the Unity is divine or good. There can be a Unity and it can be divine without everything about it always, or even sometimes, being divine.22 It would be a mistake however to think that evil is fundamentally or only a problem in moral philosophy for the pantheist - that it has nothing to do with one's pantheism. Evil - or 'morality' in general - will have a religious dimension for the pantheist because answers and approaches to some of the fundamental questions of moral philosophy must be connected in various ways to one's understand- ing of the nature of the divine Unity. An 'evil' action for a pantheist will be one that works against or is disruptive of the Unity in some way. If pantheism is a genuinely religious position there will have to be intrinsic connections between its understanding of Unity and what the pantheist regards as morally right and valuable. This is an affirmation of Clifford Geertz's claim that a religion's world view and ethos are dynamically interactive; and tht what it is that a particular cultural system (i.e. religion) sees as right and wrong reflects the way in which they understand the nature of ultimate reality (i.e. how they think things really are).23 Because pantheism, like any other religion, is fundamentally concerned with the 'problem of meaning', and because evil is always a central ingredient of that problem, pantheism must concern itself with evil - though not the theistic formulation of the problem. In fact, evil is the primary concern of various pantheists. Arguably, it is the principle concern of Spinoza and the central topic of his Ethics. It does not present the kind of challenge in terms of consistency or plausibility that the theistic problem of evil presents for theism. Nevertheless, for Spinoza, evil is a problem and it takes the entire Ethics to show that it can only be overcome through a special kind of knowledge and understanding of 'God or Nature'. 4. Pantheism and evil: No worries I now return to the widely held view that evil is as much of a problem, ormore of one, for pantheism as it is for theism. Owen claims 'It is difficult enough to square this fact [i.e. evil, and especially moral evil]</page><page sequence="11">139 with belief in an omnipotent and infinitely loving Creator. It is much more difficult to square it with the view that an evil world is an actual expres- sion of God's perfect nature'. A claim similar to Owen's is made by Spinoza's early critic Pierre Bayle in his Historical and Critical Dictio- nary^ Fredrick M. Barnard says: Bayle described Spinoza's philosophy as 'the most absurd and monstrous hypothesis that can be envisaged, contrary to the most evident notions of our mind'. Bayle' s antagonism to Spinoza's philosophy arose primarily from his dissatisfaction with monism as a solution to the problem of evil. That such an extreme evil as war could exist among men who are but modes of one and the same infinite, eternal, and self-sufficient substance seemed particularly outrageous to him.25 In one of the passages Barnard is referring to Bayle says: Here is a philosopher [Spinoza] who finds it good that God be both the agent and the victim of all the crimes and miseries of man . . . that there should be wars and battles when men are only the modifications of the same being, when consequently, only God acts ... is what surpasses all the monstrosities and chimerical disorders of the craziest people who were ever put away in lunatic asylums . . . modes do nothing; and it is the substances alone that act and are acted upon.26 As Barnard notes, Bayle' s objection is directe particularly to Spinoza's monism. Since Owen claims that 'pantheists are monists', his view that evil ('especially moral evil') is an especially severe problem for pantheism should also be seen as directed primarily at monism's rather than pan- theism's alleged inability to deal with the problem of evil. Since monism should be distinguished from pantheism (i.e., pantheists may be monists but they need not be; and it is not generally important to their pantheism if they are), the kind of objection Bayle raises against Spinoza in particular, and Owen raises against pantheism generally, will miss its mark against any pantheistic view that is not fundamentally based on substantival monism. The Bayle/Owen objection will apply to only very few versions of pantheism - only monistic types.27 It may not even be applicable to Spinoza's pantheism unless it is understood in a way that sees it resting exclusively on his substance monism. Spinoza would not deny that it is modes of the single substance that are warring. But why see this as objectionable? Bayle seems to think of it as a single person split in two and committing atrocities against itself - a kind of ontological schizophrenia. But no single 'person' is posited by pantheists - only a Unity. Furthermore, the relevance of the kind of ontological consideration Bayle thinks so crucial is dubious. Bayle never says why it is important. Nevertheless, in view of the classical theistic doctrine of creation and</page><page sequence="12">140 the problem of evil, there is something more fundamentally problematic in the Bayle/Owen citicism. Bayle finds it 'monstrous' that wars can exist among modes of the same substance. And Owen finds it difficult to imagine how pantheism can account for evil if the world and the evil in it 'is an actual expression of God's perfect nature'. Bayle and Owen claim, implicitly and explicitly, that pantheism, because of its monism, is 'substantially' (pun intended) worse off than theism when it comes to explaining or justifying evil. Yet surely theism fares no better in terms of this kind of 'ontologically' related responsibility for evil. Given the doctrine of creation ex nihilo God must be (as both Grace Jantzen and Keith Ward acknowledge), in some sense, responsible for evil in the world.28 Theism's claim that God and the world are ontologically distinct hardly resolves the aspect of the problem with evil that is objectionable to both Bayle and Owen. Suppose one grants the theistic hypothesis that the world and God are not co-substantial but are ontologically distinct. Why would Bayle find 'warring' less 'monstrous' among people who are not modes of the same substance but are nevertheless created by an infinite, eternal, self-subsistent and perfectly good substance? Pantheism is at least no worse off than theism here. What is so particularly objectionable about modes that fight? Perhaps it disrupts the kind of Unity posited by pan- theists. But this would have to be established and Bayle does not do so. What is more objectionable about modes fighting than people (who are not modes) fighting? And why would Owen think that the idea of 'an evil world [which] is an actual expression of God's perfect nature', is con- siderably more difficult to make sense of, or 'justify', than a world that is freely created ex nihilo by God and contains evil? Leaving these questions aside, the pantheist is not committed to the view that Owen thinks she is; that the evil in the world, or 'an evil world', 'is an actual expression of God's perfect nature'. According to classical theism, people are responsible for the evil present in the world since they freely choose to commit it. (This refers to moral evil but not to physical evil such as earthquakes. The 'devil' is sometimes taken to be responsible for physical evil - as he (possibly) is, for example, by Alvin Plantinga. Thus, physical evil is also a type of 'moral evil' attributable to free (devilish) agents.)29 It is peculiarly alleged that the human race is partly responsible for Adam's sin of disobedience and so is being punished for it. Nevertheless, an aspect of responsibility must adhere to the creator as well. If not, why not? And 'if not', then why suppose the pantheistic Unity must bear more of, or a different kind of, responsibility for its modes than God does for his creation? Much weight is put on the significance of substance by Bayle and Owen - more than pantheists themselves put on it - or should put on it. If pantheists are not</page><page sequence="13">141 monists, then what Bayle and Owen are really arguing for is that monism cannot account for evil - or rather that the problem of evil cannot be resolved in a monistic metaphysical context. But even this claim is unconvincing. Given that God created the world, which contains evil, why should not monism be able to offer explanations for evil not too different from those hypothesised in the context of theistic pluralism? The idea that monism cannot give an account of evil is itself based on a theistic assump- tion that the monistic 'One' must be good, whatever else it is, and if it is good then no evil can come from it. This is an odd supposition to make in the theistic context since, given the theistic doctrine of creation, God created a world that has evil in it and so in effect evil, like everything else, comes partly from God. There are no cases I know of in which pantheism's alleged inability to account for evil is based on some contemporary theory of ethics or purely ethical considerations. Instead, as with Bayle and Owen, cases of pan- theism's alleged inability to deal with evil are often based on the accep- tance of some aspect of theistic metaphysics (e.g., concerning the nature of evil) and on the conflation of pantheism with monism. It is then claimed that monism cannot account for evil. For example, 'evil' is sometimes conceived of in theistic metaphysics not as being anything 'positive' but only as 'privation'. An argument by Paul Siwek illustrates this. He says, Evil is a privation. How could this exist in a Being who, by hypothesis, exists all alone? Since he alone possesses existence, he exists only by his own strength: it is quite clear that in this case he owes absolutely nothing to others. Now, now could such a being lack any reality or perfection, which is due to him? Limitation, Spinoza affirms, can only come from outside . . . But, also according to Spinoza, outside of God nothing exists. Moreover, the Being who exists by virtue of his own essence, must possess being in all its fullness, and is therefore neces- sarily infinite. How then could such a being ever find itself affected by a privation of any kind? ... the only reality that so exists, God, is confused by the Pantheists with universal being . . . universal being does not admit in itself any limitation, any restriction, consequently it admits no imperfection. How then could Evil be introduced into the world? ... there is no room for Evil in pantheistic monism. That which we call 'Evil' would be an illusion. . .30 The pantheist rejects the medieval theistic notion that evil is a privation in the sense that it is nothing real but is only constituted by a lack of 'being' of reality or perfection. The sense in which evil might be associated witht he notion of 'privation' for the pantheist would be a very different one. Evil may at times reflect disunity or the absence of whatever it is the pantheistic Unity is predicated upon. Siwek thinks that pantheism claims</page><page sequence="14">142 there is a 'Being who, by hypothesis, exists all alone'. But pantheism (i.e. non-personal pantheism) rejects the idea that the Unity is a 'Being' and it also rejects the idea that the Unity must 'exist all alone'. (Siwek focuses on Spinoza, but he too rejected the idea that God is a Being.) Unity must 'exist alone' only if it is interpreted trivially as 'all that exists'. The idea that evil comes from 'limitation' or other kinds of 'privation' is based in the theistic idea that God who is perfect, infinite etc. cannot be limited or deprived in any way. Therefore, it is supposed that whatever is evil cannot be attributed to or associated with God who has the highest degree of reality possible. Only that which is finite can be (indeed must be) limited or deprived. But the pantheist rejects (or should reject) all of this, since she does not accept the existence of a perfect infinite God to begin with. Pantheism is the view that there exists an all-inclusive divine Unity. It is not (necessarily) the view that there exists a perfect and infinite God. There are other reasons to reject this view as well - including its intel- ligibility. The notion of 'degrees of reality' plays no role in contemporary metaphysics. Another reason evil is taken to be an irresolvable problem for pan- theism is because pantheism is equated with Spinoza and his strict determinism and determinism undermines moral responsibility. According to Spinoza, 'freedom' properly understood has nothing to do with free will. Free will, or rather the feeling of free will, is an illusion. But if everything is strictly determined and free will is an illusion then there can be no human moral responsibility since such responsibility presupposes freedom. Henry Oldenburg, the secretary of the 'Royal Society' made this point in a letter to Spinoza. 'If we men are, in all our actions, moral as well as natural, under the power of God, like clay in the hands of the potter, with what face can any of us be accused of doing this or that, seeing that it was impossible for him to do otherwise? Should we not be able to cast all responsibility on God?'31 This was, and perhaps still is, one of the principal objections to Spinoza's view of 'freedom' and his entire metaphysical system - that it undermines morality. Determinism of the Spinozistic variety was also seen as undermining any purpose and meaning in life. Spinoza, of course, denied this as well. For Spinoza, purpose and meaning (i.e., what constitutes meaning and purpose) could only be understood in the context of his system, but this is not to say that purpose and meaning are not generally part of people's lives. Although strict determinism may be intrinsic to Spinoza's system it is in no way intrinsic to pantheism per se. Pantheists will claim that whatever the conditions of freedom are that are necessary for, or presup- posed by, the notion of genuine moral responsibility, these conditions obtain in the Unity. Why suppose that the inclusion of these conditions are</page><page sequence="15">143 not consistent with a pantheistic criterion of Unity? Pantheists do not deny free will and they do not deny moral responsibility. Determinism is the exception, not the rule, in pantheism. Neither meaning nor purpose in life, moral responsibility, nor freedom are denied by pantheists. Insofar as evil is interpreted in terms of theistic metaphysical doctrines pantheism rejects the interpretation. Where evil, or immorality, is con- sidered apart from theism and put in the context of some ethical theory of goodness and account of what makes an action a moral one, various options for discussing what is right and wrong, good and bad, are open to pantheism. But there is no problem of evil in any theistic sense. To speak of a 'problem of evil' is already to speak of a fundamentally theistic problem in the context of a fundamentally theistic framework - all of which the pantheist rejects. For the pantheist, evil is not something that has to be accounted for or interpreted in such a way so as to be consistent with God's perfect goodness. The problem of evil as such arises only for the theist and only because the theist maintains, as essential, the belief that God is perfectly good, omnipotent, etc., and must then explain why and how evil occurs given this view of God's nature.32 That is what theodicy is about. The pantheist's ethical views will be related in significant ways to her account of Unity, but this has nothing to do with the theistic problem of evil. This just reflects that ethical analyses and concepts of all kinds - theistic, atheistic, or whatever - are connected to various metaphysical views. Bayle and Owen are not alone in conflating monism with pantheism and then denying that pantheism, because it is a form of monism, can adequately account for evil. If Marcus Ford is right, William James' argument against believing in a monistic universe (and the monistic 'subspecies of pantheism' which he called 'the philosophy of the ab- solute'), and for believing in a 'pluralistic unvierse' (and the pluralistic subspecies of pantheism which he called 'radical empiricism') was motivated by his concern that monism could not account for evil. Accord- ing to Ford, James' pluralism is fundamentally related to his 'ad hoc' solution to the problem of evil and certain related philosophical assump- tions. Ford says, Unable to deny the existence of real evil in the world, and unable to deny God's absolute goodness, James chose to assert that God is not all-inclusive - that there are other things (evil things, for example) which exist apart from God . . . Ironically, pluralism ... is not a central tenet of pluralistic pantheism; it is simply an ad hoc solution to the classical problem of evil once James assumed that to be included in another's consciousness constitutes being controlled or determined by the other being ... it is only his ad hoc solution . . . that distinguishes his</page><page sequence="16">144 'pluralistic' pantheism from the monistic alternative ... James' philosophy is itself essentially monistic; its pluralism is only accident- al.* James not only conflates monism with pantheism, he also conflates the pantheistic Unity with a kind of theistic God. Both the monistic and pluralistic varieties of pantheism he distinguishes are associated with theism in this way. The significant alternative for James is not theism or pantheism - they are too closely related - but rather monism or pluralism. Inherent in theism is a kind of pantheistic unity for James. In this regard James is not different from numerous other theistic mystics who take pantheism to be a natural extension of theism that is borne out in their experience. In the cases discussed it is clearly monism rather than pantheism that presents what pantheism's critics see as its inherent inability to cope with evil. Once it is denied that there is a logical connection between pantheism and monism, then whatever problems evil is seen as causing for monism - however the existence of evil is seen as undermining or defeating monism - the same reasons will not necessarily hold against pantheism. At any rate, just supposing that the world and God are ontologically or substantially distinct (i.e., just denying monism) does not appear to offer a basis for some fundamental resolution to the problem of evil. The theistic responses to at least the empirical argument from evil against existence of God, devil and all, strain one's credulity. (Even where the existence of God is not questioned, proposed solutions to the problem are rebuffed by theists like Job.) The only advantage the theistic supposition that the world and God are distinct seems to offer is that there is no longer a sense in which God himself (e.g. via his attributes and modes) is performing the evil 'against' himself. But this is hardly an advantage when one realises that pantheists, including Spinoza, are not operating with a notion of God as a person. The criticisms of Bayle and Owen assume that pantheists are operating in important ways with a theistic notion of deity. If pantheists are not employing a theistic concept of God, then why is it objectionable to suppose that modes of the one and same substance might war? Why is it objectionable to suppose that an evil world, or evil in the world, is an actual expression of God's (perfect) nature? Is it theism, not pantheism, that claims God is perfect. Pantheistic Unity need not be 'perfect' and so pantheism avoids various problems generated by 'perfect-being theology' - including 'evil' - the 'biggest' of them all. What is it about evil, exactly, that Bayle and Owen think requires an explanation? Looking at the classical theistic problem of evil, it is difficult to discover any pantheistic analogue for it. It is a uniquely theistic problem and one that the pantheist can shrug off since its formulation entails an</page><page sequence="17">145 essentially theistic doctrine of deity. The criticisms of pantheism having to do with evil, taken to be so devastating for so long, have no force. Further- more, the sense in which evil does present a real problem for pantheism, as it does for any religion, has been ignored. It is ignored because critical discourse in philosophical theology has been dominated, as it still is, by classical theism. It sets the agenda by setting the questions and treating the theistic context as a given. Bayle's and Owen's criticisms in particular fail because they rely on a quasi-theistic notion of deity that pantheists - including Spinoza who is their main target - do not accept. Given the classical theistic doctrine of creation, divine conservation, etc. the view that pantheism is less able to cope with and account for evil than is theism is without foundation. As soon as one disassociates pantheism from both monism and from theism, the specific problems that evil may present for monism (from a theistic perspective) or theism, are no longer applicable. Whether evil is an irresolvable problem for monism is beside the point here, but of course Spinoza denied that it was. In fact he claimed that only for monism was evil not a problem. From what has been said, evil is seen as a problem for monism primarily in the context of a theistic metaphysic. But the philosophical monist (there are no other kinds) might well reject assump- tions such as 'evil is a privation'. There is nothing intrinsic to monism that makes evil any problem at all for it - let alone an irresolvable one. The theistic attempt to show that evil is a problem for monism and pantheism involves exporting a problem that only makes sense in the context of theism. Idealism went quietly from anglo-american philosophy early in this century, and monism tended to go with it. Idealism has had some recent defenders, including some in the analytic tradition (e.g. John Foster and Howard Robinson). But idealism and monism are no longer generally taken to be philosophically defensible positions. The pantheist, then, would be wise not to rely on assumptions that can only be made in the context of such positions. In this way it may be possible to distance pantheism from whatever untoward metaphysical commitments such positions entail. The pantheist, having abandoned a theistic world view as untenable, will not want to opt for some other view that appears equally untenable.34</page><page sequence="18">146 Notes 1. H.P. Owen, Concepts of Deity (London: Macmillan, 1971), p. 72. 2. The idea that pantheism cannot account for evil, or that it cannot resolve the problem of evil has been a major criticism of pantheism at least since Spinoza. It was one of Bayle's principle objections. Pierre Bayle, Historical and Critical Dictionary: Selections, trans. Richard Popkin (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1965). Cf. Kierkegaard: 'So-called pantheistic systems have often been characterised and challenged in the assertion that they abrogate the distinction between good and evil, and destroy freedom. Perhaps one would express oneself quite as definitely, if one said that every such system fantastically dissipates the concept of existence.' S0ren Kierkegaard, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, trans. D.F. Swenson and W. Lowrie (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1944), p. 111. 3. For what is still a good overview of the problem of evil and proposed solutions see H.J. McCloskey, 'God and Evil', Philosophical Quarterly 10 (1960), pp. 97-114. Also see, Nelson Pike, God and Evil: Readings on the Theological Problem of Evil (New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1964); Marilyn McCord Adams and Robert M. Adams, eds., The Problem of Evil (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990). 4. Some pantheists will dispense with the problem of evil because the concept of evil may be seen as an essentially theistic one, explainable only in terms of other theistic concepts such as God. This is one reason why the problem of evil - indeed, the very notion of 'evil' - may be regarded as inapplicable to pantheism. 5. Alvin Plantinga, 'God, Evil and the Metaphysics of Freedom', in The Problem of Evil, ed. Marilyn McCord Adams and Robert M. Adams (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), pp. 83-109, 108. 6. He is by no means the only example. See, for example, Peter Van Inwagen, 'The Problem of Evil, the Problem of Air, and the Problem of Silence', in Philosophical Perspectives, Vol. 5, ed. James Tomberlin (California: Ridgeview Publishing, 1991), pp. 135-165. Van Inwagen claims that the existence of evil does not constitute any evidence whatsoever against the existence of God. Also see, R.M. Adams, 'Must God Create the Best?', in The Concept of God, ed. T.V. Morris (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), pp. 91-106. My present concern is not to argue for the sheer im- plausibility of their theses, but merely to register the fact that their essays, in a sense, constitute a refusal to address the problem of evil. 7. William Rowe says, 'It is one thing to argue that the existence of evil is logically incompatible with the existence of the theistic God and quite another thing to argue that the world contains evils that render the existence of the theistic God unlikely. The former is the logical argument from evil; the latter is the empirical argument from evil', The empirical argument is also called the 'evidential', 'probabilistic', and 'inductive' argument. William Rowe, 'The Empirical Argument From Evil', in Rationality, Religious Belief and Commitment, ed. Robert Audi (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1986), pp. 217-224, 227. 8. The logical argument is often stated more simply in terms of it being 'inconsistent for anyone to believe both of the following two propositions: I.</page><page sequence="19">147 The world is the creation of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good. II. The world contains evil'. Terence Penelhum, 'Divine Goodness and the Problem of Evil', in The Problem of Evil, eds. Adams and Adams, pp. 69-82, 69. ). Cf. William Rowe, The Empirical Argument From Evil; Evil and Theodicy', Philosophical Topics 16 (1988), pp. 119-132. Also see the exchange beteen Rowe and Stephen Wykstra in The Problem of Evil, eds. Adams and Adams. Although most versions of the argument from evil against the existence of God have been of the 'logical' rather than the 'empirical' (or 'probabilistic') type, Rowe's empirical argument is more successful than any logical argument can hope to be. This is because it is unlikely to suppose that one can ever 'prove' that there is an incompatibility between some alleged essential property of God and the existence of some evil. It is always possible to claim the evil is necessary for a greater good. The empirical argument is more straightforward in this regard. It denies the plausibility, not the possibility, of assuming that at least some evils are necessary for a greater good. Some of these apparently 'useless' evils may not result from human free will, and so it cannot be claimed that free will is a value that far exceeds the evil that results from it - especially given that more good than evil is done overall. Of course it is always possible to posit the devil and to suppose that God limiting the devil's choices is a greater evil than allowing the devil to do what he will. Cf. Alvin Plantinga, 'God, Evil, and the Metaphysics of Freedom', pp. 107-109. ). Alternatively, as a 'way out' of the problem of evil, one might deny the truth of one or more of the conjuncts in the first premise, and so the truth of the premise itself. It could be denied that God is omnipotent, omniscient or perfectly good. This is not however the way out usually taken since proposi- tion (1) in its entirety is regarded as essential to theism. One does not reject (1) without abandoning theism. I. Solutions that deny the reality of evil must rest on some kind or ap- pearance/reality distinction (i.e., things are not really always what they seem to be). Consider the claim that 'evil is only apparent'. Here is an argument. 'If looked at not from our partial perspectives, but from an all-encompassing, divine, or eternal perspective we would see that the apparent "evil" in this world is necessary for a far greater good. There can not be the good that there would be if not for the apparent "evil" in this world. Therefore, from the perspective of one who can see the greater good, the apparent evil is not really "evil" at all but an ingredient necessary in the circumstances for the greater good'. But even if some allegedly 'merely apparent' evil is necessary for a greater good is it not an evil anyway? Does its 'being required for a greater good' mean that it is not a real instance of evil? If an evil is trans- muted to a greater good is it always (or ever) the case that what we took to be the evil before it combined with other factors to produce a greater good, was not then a real evil? And does it not remain an evil? If Hitler was killed as a baby would not that have been a real evil - albeit a fortunate one? There are many other kinds of difficulties with views that deny the reality of evil. Suppose a child's early death would lead to a greater good. How is it good for that child to have died young no matter what kind of good it leads to? (Ivan makes a similar point in The Brother's Karamazov.) But if it is not good for that very child, then that child is being treated not as autonomous</page><page sequence="20">148 individual but as a means to someone else's end. 12.

In a letter to his brother and sister in April 1819 Keats says 'The common cognomen of this world among the misguided and super- stitious is "a vale of tears" from which we are to be redeemed by a certain arbitrary interposition of God and taken to Heaven - What a little cir- cumscribed straightened notion! Call the world if you Please "The vale of Soul-making" . . . Do you not see . . . how necessary a World of Pains and troubles is to school an Intelligence and make it a Soul?'

The fact that God cannot create us so that we always freely choose to do the good is not generally regarded as conflicting with God's omnipotence. It is not a restriction on God's power that he is unable to do what it is logically impossible to do. The usual view is that God's omnipotence consists in being able to do everything (and only those things) that it is logically possible to do. 15. Alvm Plantinga, God, Evil and the Metaphysics of Freedom , pp. 85-86. For reasons that will be discussed, even if Plantinga is right in showing that 'it is possible that God could not have created a universe containing moral good . . . without creating one containing moral evil' he will not have addressed the issue in its most potent form (i.e. the empirical argument). Plantinga dis- cusses the empirical argument in 'The Probabilistic Argument from Evil', Philosphical Studies 35 (1979), pp. 1-53. 16. Cf.

For a recent defence of 'compatibilism', see Fred Dretske, 'The Metaphysics of Freedom', Canadian Journal of Philosophy 22 (1992), pp. 1-14. 18. I forgo a detailed discussion of Robert M. Adams's essay 'Must God Create the Best?' Like Plantinga, R.M. Adams has based a kind of theodicy on contentious assumptions concerning what God can possibly do. His argument also rests on dubious criteria of personal identity. Adams argues that a 'creator would [not] necessarily wrong someone (violate someone's rights, or be less kind to someone than a perfectly moral agent must be), if he knowingly created a less excellent world instead of the best that he could' (p. 92). He says, 'A merely possible being cannot be (actually) wronged or treated unkindly. A being who never exists is not wronged by not being created, and there is no obligation to any possible being to bring it into existence' (p. 93). 19. Suppose Plantinga, Adams and others have shown that the existence of evil is consistent with the existence of God. The more significant question is</page><page sequence="21">149 whether there is reason to believe it is probable that God exists given the amount and kind of evil there is. Is it plausible to suppose there is a morally sufficient reason for every evil such that God would allow it? Is it plausible to suppose that free will is so valuable God would not prevent its exercise in some cases in which there appears to be an overwhelming prima facie case for doing so? Cf., William Rowe, The Empirical Argument From Evil'; 'Evil and Theodicy'. 20. Peter Van Inwagen says, ... a moral for students of the problem of evil: Do not attempt any solution to this problem that entails that every particular evil has a purpose, or that, with respect to every individual misfortune, or every devastating earthquake, or every disease, God has some special reasons for allowing it. Concentrate rather on the problem of what sort of reasons a loving and providential God might have for allowing His creatures to live in a world in which many of the evils that happen to them happen to them for no reason at all'. Peter Van Inwagen, The Place of Chance in A World Sus- tained By God', p. 235, in Thomas V. Morris, ed., Divine and Human Action (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1988), pp. 211-235. This quotation could be taken as suggesting that a plausible rejection of the argument from evil against the existence of God must not rely on the kinds of claims that are often used against the logical version of the argu- ment; for example, that it is possible that such and such an evil leads to a greater good so God must allow it. But, van Inwagen' s 'moral for students of the problem of evil' is far more applicable to those who wish to refute the empirical argument. It is more applicable for those who claim that it is plausible to suppose that such and such an evil leads to a greater good so God must allow it, Still, one wonders why van Inwagen thinks he needs the 'moral' he issues. After all, the most common defence against the argument from evil is the Free Will Defence, and in that defence it is not assumed or argued but denied 'that every particular evil has a purpose, or that, with respect to every individual misfortune, or every devastating earthquake, or every disease, God has some special reason for allowing it'. The Free Will Defence maintains that there is an overall reason for God allowing such evils, but no special reason for any particular evil. When Van Inwagen says 'Concentrate rather on the problem of what sort of reasons a loving and providential God might have for allowing His creatures to live in a world in which many of the evils that happen to them happen to them for no reason at all', he seems to have come face to face with Job. He acknowledges the force of the logical and empirical arguments from evil while denying the conclu- sion. This is a great advance (i.e. a qualitatively different approach) over the kinds of defensive approaches that, for example, Plantinga or Adams take. A way of putting this is to say that Van Inwagen accepts and understands Job's problem, whereas Plantinga and Adams denies he has one. Still, Van Inwagen' s 'moral for students of the problem of evil' is applicable only to the crudest of those who offer defences against the argument from evil. Who, after all, seriously maintains that every particular evil has a purpose? 21. Michael Peterson generalises the point about the priority of the empirical over the logical argument from evil when he says, The more interesting and important formulation of the problem of evil is not as an a priori problem of the internal consistency of theism. The problem is more powerfully formu- lated as an a posteriori matter regarding the acceptability or probability of</page><page sequence="22">150 theism in light of relevant external considerations. The problem must be moved from the sphere of purely formal logic into the arena of human thought and decision, into the realm where rational and moral persons assess theism in the light of their values, ontological commitments, and existential orientations. Indeed, this rendition of the problem of evil pervades the classical and contemporary literature ... the atheologian ... at best ... can claim that theism is unacceptable or improbable according to the external considerations which are present and central to his evaluation, and not that it is essentially irrational. The theist, on the other hand, may claim that theism is reasonable because it makes quite good sense of experience, is morally acceptable, and so on.' Michael L. Peterson, 'Evil and Inconsistency', Sophia 18 (1979), pp. 20-27. See p. 27, n.l 1 for Peterson's examples of the literature that concerns itself with 'the problem of prima facie gratuitous evil'. 22. Some account of what it is to be 'divine' is needed here. I forgo such an account in the present context noting only that while anything 'divine' is also taken to be perfectly good by some theists, the two properties are not, and should not, be taken as mutually entailing one another by pantheists. In Rudolf Otto's account of the 'holy' he explicitly separates the concept of goodness and moral perfection from that of holiness. See, Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy, 2nd edn. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1950). 23. Cf. Clifford Geertz, 'Religion as a Cultural System', Chapter 4, in The Interpretationof Cultures (New York: Basic Books, 1973), pp. 87-125; 'Ethos, World View, and the Analysis of Sacred Symbols', Chapter 5, pp. 126-141. 24. Pierre Bayle, Dictionnaire histonque and critique, 2nd edn. (Rotterdam, 1702). Bayle argues against Spinoza in several ways. For example he claims that the supposition that 'men are modalities of God' leads to a contradiction. 'If it were true then, as Spinoza claims, that men are modalities of God, one would speak falsely when one said, "Peter denies this, he wants that, he affirms such and such a thing"; for actually ... it is God who denies, wants . . . from which it follows that God hates and loves, denies and affirms the same things at the same time ... for it cannot be denied that, taking all these terms with all possible rigor, some men love and affirm what other men hate and deny ...' (pp. 309-310, in Popkin, edition of Bayle's Dictionary). Bayle would deny that he is committing the fallacy of composition, since he thinks that only substances, not modalities, can act or be acted upon (p. 311). But Spinoza would deny that God (or substance), as he understands the term, denies and affirms the same thing at the same time. Any attempt to resolve a substantive issue relating to pantheism by resorting to the kind of ontological consideration that Bayle does will be unsatisfactory. Indeed, I am inclined to generalise and say that fundamental ontological considerations (e.g. what exists) are for the most part not relevant to determining either what pantheism is, or to resolving conceptual issues related to it - e.g., if pantheism should account for evil - and if so, why? 25. Frederick M. Barnard, 'Spinozism', in Paul Edwards, ed. The Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1967), Vol. 5, p. 541. Cf. Pierre Bayle Historical and Critical Dictionary, trans. Richard Popkin, p. 296 for the 'monstrous hypothesis' quotation. Bayle uses the term 'monstrous' many times in the article on Spinoza and not always about Spinoza. He also calls the Tractatus theologico-politicus 'a pernicious and detestable book' (p. 293). Hume also</page><page sequence="23">151 referred to Spinoza's philosophy as that 'hideous hypothesis'. Unlike Bayle, it is difficult to imagine that Hume was not being sarcastic. 26. Pierre Bayle, Historical and Critical Dictionary, trans. Richard Popkin, p. 311. 27. See my article, Monism and Pantheism , Southern Journal of Philosophy 30 (1992), pp. 95-1 10. 1 claim that monism and pantheism are distinct positions. Not all monists are pantheists and most pantheists are not (and should not be) monists. Instead, like most people, they are pluralists. 28. Cf. Grace Jantzen, God's World, God's Body (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1984), Chapter 7; Keith Ward, 'God as Creator', in Godfrey Vesey, ed., The Philosophy in Christianity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), pp. 99-118. 29. The supposition that it is actually the devil who is responsible for earthquakes etc. may seem anachronistic and jarring - or worse. But there is not, or need not be anything extraordinary about the claim to one who accepts the bulk of the theistic world view. This too one may find unsettling. 30. Paul Siwek, 'How Pantheism Resolves the Enigma of Evil', Laval Theologique et Philosophique 11-12 (1955-5), pp. 213-221, 213-214. For Spinoza, evil is a kind of illusion, an 'inadequate idea' resulting from inadequate knowledge. Siwek goes on to claim that 'evil loses any intelligible meaning in Spinoza's doctrine, that it is metaphysically impossible' (p. 214). 31. Spinoza, Epistolae, LXXVII. Quoted in Thomas McFarland, Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition, p. 88. Spinoza claims that people are nevertheless morally responsible for their actions. Cf. Paul Siwek, 'How Pantheism Resolves the Enigma of Evil', p. 220. Kant objected to Spinoza on various grounds - including his notion of freedom. Given Spinoza's account 'Freedom could not be saved ... man would be a marionette, or an automaton, carpentered together and put on strings by the highest master of all crafts, and though self-consciousness would make it a thinking automaton, the consciousness of its spontaneity, if this spontaneity were equated with freedom, would be a mere illusion' (Kant, Werke, III, pp. 567-568). Quoted in McFarland, p. 90. Kant may be right in claiming that Spinoza's deter- minism undermines freedom in various ways, including the sense of freedom necessary for morality and meaningful moral discourse. But note too that in this quotation Kant is attributing to Spinoza the concept of something like a theistic God, even though Spinoza's God was nothing at all like the theistic God. 32. For a discussion of how the problem of evil is 'dissolved' in the context of an 'immanentist' non- anthropomorphic metaphysical framework (e.g. Spinoza and Nietzsche), see Chin-Tai Kim 'Transcendence and Immanence', Journal of the American Academy of Religion 40 (1987), pp. 537-549. 33. Marcus P. Ford, 'Pluralistic Pantheism?', Southern Journal of Philosophy 17 (1979), pp. 155-161,159-160. 34. Note too that this distinction suffices for dualism, but not for theism.
