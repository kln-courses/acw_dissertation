<plain_text><page sequence="1">Waterfowl in Australia.-Harry Frith. 1968. Honolulu, East-West Center Press. 328 pp., 5 col. pls., 32 photos, 39 maps and figures, 61/2 X 91/2 in. $10.00.-Few continents have a more fascinating group of waterfowl than does Australia. There are only 19 native breeding species, and most taxonomists place the 6 endemic forms in monotypic genera. Little has been known of any of these species, and the present volume therefore has been eagerly awaited. Although this work covers a wide range of information, it is essentially a one-man effort. Frith, Chief of the Division of Wildlife Research of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organi- zation, has studied most Australian species in their major habitats. Recently he has directed the research efforts of co-workers who continue to contribute a vast amount of knowledge on the biology of Australian waterfowl. The general plan of the book is a comparatively brief (43-page) review of the taxonomy, general habits, breeding biology, habitat relationships and conservation of Australian waterfowl. Much of the data reported in this section are based on work previously published by Frith. Pertinent comments relate Australian waterfowl to those of the world, and they demonstrate an excellent knowledge of the subject. A</page><page sequence="2">368 Reviews [Auk, Vol. 86 section on field identification contains drawings of ducks on the water and in flight; these are crude by Frith's own evaluation, but they are functional. Many readers will feel that the approach in this section is a profitable one which could have been expanded. The bulk of the book (ca. 275 pp.) is devoted to species accounts. The 19 life histories of major species average 13 pages each; the 2 on stragglers and 2 on exotics average 4 pages each. All accounts are arranged taxonomically, basically following Delacour (Waterfowl of the world, 4 vols., 1954-64) except that the Freckled Duck (Stictonetta naevosa) is considered in a separate tribe, stictonettini of the Anserinae, and the Chestnut Teal (Anas castanea) is regarded as conspecific with Anas aucklandica of New Zealand. The former judgment is based on Frith's own work, the latter on work in New Zealand; both seem reasonable assumptions. Frith also follows Woolfenden (Postcranial osteology of the waterfowl, 1961) in recognizing a separate tribe, Cygnini, for the swans. Some of the species accounts seem long, but it must be remembered that the biology of most of these species has been little known and that these are definitive summaries. Here, as in the entire book, the author makes a point of clarifying what is and what isn't known. References are by number-an inconvenience to the scientist but a pleasure for the many laymen who will find the book extremely useful. Some readers will prefer more complete documentation of statements. The distribution maps are well done, although the use of the same symbols for different purposes on different maps is somewhat confusing. Where pertinent, maps include New Zealand, New Guinea, and Asia. Accounts include the following categories for most species: References (= nomen- clatural history), Other Names (= vernacular names in Australia and elsewhere), Description (by age and sex), Size, Voice, Routine (= general habits), Relationships (= taxonomic review which includes waterfowl of the world), Field Recognition (sometimes long but more meaningful here than being overly specific in the general section), Habitat, Distribution and Movements (often based on excellent banding data), Food and Feeding (often reporting detailed results of research), Breeding (age, chronology and environmental relationships), Nest, Eggs, Clutch, Incubation, De- velopment of Young, Status, and Source of Data. Vernacular names are a problem everywhere and Frith obviously had difficulty finding names that would be acceptable on his own continent, much less finding ones acceptable around the world. Names like Hardhead for the Australian White- eye (Aythya australis) or Burdekin for the Radjah Shelduck (Tadorna radjah) infer nothing of the birds' taxonomic affinities. Descriptions are by general color terms. Size is shown by means of large samples, but no measures of dispersion are provided. Measurements of "wingspread" and "length" will be of value mainly to sportsmen, but weight, "bill," and wing measurements also are given. Sonograms are presented for most species-a "first" for any book on ducks. Comments on vocal behavior aid the reader in understanding visual rendition of sounds. Northern hemisphere readers will find numerous items of special interest called to their attention. Most Australian waterfowl are "nomadic" rather than migratory, and movements are water- and food-related. Breeding of most species is induced by water levels, rather than by light cycles as in the north. In spite of the desert conditions, many species are tree-hole nesters and several utilize ground burrows or rock shelters. The eclipse plumage occurs in several species, and the definitions and use of that term create some confusion. The Blue-billed Duck (Oxyura australis) is reported to have a complete prenuptial molt involving the wings and tail. In several</page><page sequence="3">April, 1969] Reviews 369 species females clearly exceed males in size, a situation that seems rare among water- fowl. Some conservation problems there resemble those of the U. S. A.; for example, the impact of irrigation in drying the seasonally-flooded marshes that constitute the major breeding areas. Another problem common to many countries, but not well appreciated in the U. S. A., is that harvest and conservation programs are state rather than nationally controlled. This could create serious problems in establishing policies and balancing utilization of this resource. Illustrations are interspersed throughout the text. The five color plates by Betty Temple Watts illustrate all species and brighten the book. They are fresh, bold and, although a few postures and eye positions may be questioned, generally good. The only apparent error is the illustration in Plate V of Aythya australis which overempha- sizes the eyeline. Some of the ducklings in the same plate seem to be of different ages. The Freckled Duck duckling probably is figured here in color for the first time. The photographs, mostly by Ederic Slater but with some by Frith, complement the book nicely. They include a few portraits of single birds, but generally they show flocks and habitat and give the reader a real feeling for the Australian waterfowl scene. The shots of ducks underwater are the best I have seen, and show the ducks' use of the nictitating membrane and the lateral action of the feet during diving. Placement of photos near related text material could have been better. In general the style is readable and clear, but some sentences are rather long and complex and a number of statements are anthropomorphic. No book of this scope goes to press without a few errors. Minimum-maximum wing measurements of Aythya australis have been transposed on page 244. There are a few misspellings and a few misplaced commas. The type is large and readable, the binding is adequate, but the paper is somewhat soft. Considering the many illustrations, the book is a good buy at $10.00. Many North Americans will consider this book the "Kortright" (Ducks, geese and swans of North America, 1942) of Australian Waterfowl-but it represents mostly original work, personal experience with nearly every species and habitat, and is the product of a dedicated career in search of ways to conserve Australian waterfowl. No waterfowl specialist or enthusiast will want to be without it; most ornithologists will find it a significant and attractive addition to their library-MILTON W. WELLER.</page></plain_text>
