(Paris, Publications de l'Eeo le Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient, Volume XLI, 1959; texte: pp. XI+ 329, figs. 11, maps 3, tables XV; planches: pp. 152 with 541 pis.). This work has as its principal subject the study of the archaeological monuments 92</page><page sequence="2">of southern Siam, belonging to the Dv?ra vati era (about the 6th-12th century) and is the culmination of the scientific activity of a well-known scholar of Indochinese art, the late Pierre Dupont, member of the Ecole Franqaise d'Extreme-Orient, who died in 1955. (For a bibliography of the author see: L. Bezaeier, Bibliographie des travaux de Pierre Dupont, BEFEO, XLIX, 2, 1959, pp. 643-648). The work is posthumous, and his wife and colleagues have edited the publication; in particular, A. B. Griswold has integrat? ed with the text a number of notes, which adhere to the author's theses. Two volumes, which hold respectively the text and the plates, make up the work, presented in the usual refined and accurate typographical edition of the publications of the French School. The main part is mostly made up of the material from excavations carried out by the author in 1939-40 at Nak'on Pathom, and by a very rich pho? tographic documentation collected by the Siamese Archeological Service, by EFEO and by A. B. Griswold. The material of the text is divided into nine chapters, the last giving the conclu? sions. In the first, the author examines the ancient history of the m?n populations of Lower Burma and Siam and defines the area of their diffusion and their ethnic and linguistic affiliations. For this purpose he reviews all the archaeological, historical and literary evidence available on the sub? ject. In chapters II and III he illustrates the monuments of the Wat P'ra Men and the Wat P'ra Pat'on, both situated near P'ra Pathom, and describes the principal material found in excavations there. In the fourth chapter he examines the other archaeological monuments of Dh?ravati (Nak'on Pathom, P'ong Tiik, Lop-buri, Non P'ra, Murang P'ra Rot) and describes their principal remains. This permits him to present in the following chapter a brief essay on the general characteristics of the architecture of Dv?ravatl. Finally, in the chapters which follow he studies the Bud? dhist statuary and iconography of Dv?ra vatl, classifies the types and styles, exami? nes the persistence of the various traditions and establishes various comparisons with the artistic production of the other coun? tries. He dedicates the eighth chapter to the propagation of the m?n image of Bud? dha; the ninth to indicating certain con? clusions of a general nature. As is obvious, the material embraces an enormous field, and it is therefore difficult to condense its essential points. It is known that the name a M?n ? designates a popu? lation of the Indochinese peninsula very close to the Khmers, at least from a lin? guistic point of view; this population in the first centuries of the Christian era was principally diffused in the valley of the Lower Menam and in the deltas of the Irawadi and Saluen, a territory which in? cluded part of present-day southern Burma and Thailand. Between the 6th and 12th centuries this population made up the kingdom of Dv?ravati, which the Chinese sources localized between Burma and Cam? bodia. The origin of this kingdom may be linked to the disgregation of the Fu-nan, but little is known of its history apart from traditional references which state that the M?n had colonized, about the 8th century, the northern part of the basin of the Me? nam, founding there the city of Haripu njaya (Lamp'un). Then in the first deca? des of the 11th century the King of Cam? bodia, Siiryavarman I, extended his reign to the west, incorporating the larger part of the kingdom of Dv?ravati, and parti? cularly the city of Lav? (Lop'burl). The history of the kingdom thus stems f rom the first centuries of the Hinduiza tion of the Indochinese peninsula, and the principal remains of the region document the propagation of Indian civilization and above all of the Buddhist religion in central and western Indochina. The most note? worthy group of monuments is near P'ra Pathom (or Nak'on Pathom), P'ong T?k, Lop'buri. The remains, which range over a large period, are mainly inspired by Bud? dhist hlnay?na art and evidence the Gupta and post-Gupta traditions, but with much 93</page><page sequence="3">adherence to the styles of Amar?vati and Ceylon. The architecture, documented by many ruins, presents numerous bases of commemorative monuments (st?pa and chaitya) and platforms of monastic build? ings (vih?ra). The first are solid internally and built of brick; the second consist of a mixed construction in which only the ter? race was of brick, while the upper section was of wooden structures held up by stone columns. The st?pa, with the addition of galleries and vaulted halls, could become a rather elaborate architectonic complex, which was both commemorative monument and sanctuary. The constant element of religious architecture was therefore the brick base, but according to need this either sustained a wooden construction or a structure of commemorative nature also made of brick. Today the architecture of Dv?ravati is known above all for the ruins of three monuments: the San Chao, the Wat P'ra Men and the Wat P'ra Pat'on. The last two, situated near P'ra Pathom, are particularly interesting. The Wat P'ra Men is a model st?pa and sanctuary and is made up of a central body of brick with a square plan, surrounded by a gallery with the same plan. The Wat P'ra Pat'on is on the other hand a type of chaitya, which is formed of a structure supported by a double base with steps, and has on each of its sides five images of Buddha, placed in niches flanked by small columns and pi? lasters. Thanks to recent research carried out also by Pierre Dupont, there have been brought to light numerous fragments of ornamental architectonic parts, which give a fairly precise idea as well of the decora? tion which covered the monuments. This material includes ornamental elements in Gupta style, panels of carved stone in low relief with scenes which illustrate episodes of the life of Buddha, and votive tablets. From Nak'on Pathom come some great stone wheels, richly decorated and often accompanied by figures of stags which evoke the Mrgavana where Buddha, pro? nouncing his first sermon, put into move ment the ? wheel of the law ?. As is known, in these wheels some scholars see the persistence of a symbolic representation of Buddha, which might go back to the times when anthropomorphic iconography had not yet come into use. The statuary of the Dv?ravatI epoch is also highly interesting. It is stone sculpture which reproduces the image of Buddha, standing or seated, both in the European position and in the Indian position on the n?ga. The iconographic types are different and express both the Indian and Ceylonese tradition. According to the author, it is just in Ceylon and at Amar?vati that one should seek for the origins of local icono? graphy, which had already taken shape before the Gupta and post-Gupta contri? bution. In fact, one class of statues of Buddha, from K'orat and Nak'on Pathom, might be attributed to local production not later than the 4th-5th centuries A.D. Be? sides, a survival of the Amar?vati traditions might be recognizable also in some details such as the paryank?sana, the throne type, the representation of Buddha seated In? dian-style on the imga, and above all the use of the vitarka-mudr?, details these which, outside of Amar?vati and Ceylon, never assumed particular importance in Indian art. Their frequent presence in the art of Dv?ravatT might represent, according to the author, a precise iconographical identification. These data might allow in a last analysis, the supposition of the exis? tence down to the 6th century in the Indo? chinese zone of a form of hinay?na Bud? dhism, which would in fact have had its origins in Amar?vati and Ceylon. Beyond these first influences, the statuary of Dv?? ravatI might have undergone a broad post. Gupta influence rather than a properly Gupta one, since few pieces, according te our author, can be strictly connected to this style. The post-Gupta influence would possibly even have been exercised through an intermediary action on the part of the local production of Fu-nan. Adolfo Tamburello 94</page></plain_text>
