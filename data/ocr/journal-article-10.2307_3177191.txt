<plain_text><page sequence="1">Switching Sites and Identities: The Founder's Statue at the Buddhist Temple K6rin'in Gregory P Levine This article introduces an icon and an inscription: a virtually unstudied Buddhist portrait statue produced in Japan during the seventeenth century and a heretofore undocumented dedicatory text written on the surface of the hollow statue's interior. The statue depicts the monk Shokei J6fu (1475- 1536) and is enshrined as the founder's portrait (kaisozo) at the Zen Buddhist temple K6rin'in in Kyoto (Figs. 1, 2). Within K6rin'in today the statue's presence as the temple's founding abbot is unequivocal, and the image appears readily available for traditional art historical analysis. The inscription, however, reveals an unexpected episode of appropriation and reidentification that transpired in the late nineteenth cen- tury. The circumstances of this episode are telling with regard to the ways in which Buddhist icons have been relocated and resignified over time. They likewise provoke the need to reconsider scholarly narratives on Zen portraiture. I begin, therefore, with a description of the Korin'in statue, but my narrative takes shape through study of the recovered inscrip- tion and a sequence of temple sites and portrait sightings. Since I am implicated in the inscription's "discovery," I also wish to acknowledge how the process of art historical field- work has intersected with the K6rin'in statue's ongoing history. The Founder's Statue at Korin'in Present-day visitors to K6rin'in, located within the Rinzai Zen monastery Daitokuji (Fig. 3), encounter a striking statue of the site's founding abbot, Shokei Jofu, enshrined on the temple's altar. No detailed statements are made in the temple literature or by temple personnel regarding the image's identity or provenance, and nothing about the portrait seems unusual. One expects to see such a statue because of the enshrinement of founder's statues on the altars of each of Daitokuji's subtemples. Indeed, Daitokuji's present-day ab- bots stress that their altars are dominated by statues of Zen masters rather than the Historical Buddha Sakyamuni (Japa- nese: Shaka) to emphasize the monastery's religious leaders and the transmission of their teachings along the patriarchal lineage. The monkJofu, born in Mino Province, studied under two prominent teachers at Daitokuji before serving as the monas- tery's chief abbot from 1525 to 1528.1 In 1532, he received the ecclesiastical title of "Zen Master" (Zenji) from Emperor Go-Nara and the following year was appointed founding abbot of Korin'in, the family temple and future mortuary site of the military governor of Noto Province, Hatakeyama Yoshifusa (d. 1545). Following Jofu's death in 1536, his remains were buried at Korin'in and marked with a stupa. His presence has also lingered in "contact relics" (possessions and regalia, works of calligraphy, portraits, a discourse record (goroku, a compilation of writings), and a line of monastic and lay disciples. Korin'in's founder's statue has long served as an iconic focus for veneration of the departed master Jofu and a wellspring of spiritual identity for his religious lineage and the temple community.2 The statue measures approximately 43 inches (110 centimeters) in height and follows established conventions of iconography, carving, and decoration that appear in Zen portrait statues dating from the thirteenth century onward. Sculpted from joined blocks of hinoki (Japanese cypress), the statue comprises two pieces: a torso and detachable head set into the body at the collar. The torso has been roughly hollowed out and is empty, while the hollow head has crystal eyes (gyokugan) inserted from the concave interior. Coated with layers of lacquer, primer, and poly- chrome, the portrait shows its age in pigment loss and cracks along the face and figure. The statue's iconography evokes the sacerdotal authority, ancestral ideology, and ritual gestures of the office of abbot as well as the founder's homology with the most important ancestor, Sakyamuni. The monk Jofu, seated frontally in meditation posture (kekkafuza) and enthroned on an abbot's chair (kyokuroku), mimics the stasis of the Buddha. He is conventionally costumed: black outer and white inner robes (hoe); surplice (kesa) draped over the left shoulder and secured with a red cord tied to an octagonal ring (hekikan); and red prostration mat (zagu) folded over the left arm beneath the sleeve. Still visible on the surplice's surface are remnants of a gold arabesque (karakusa monyo) running across blue bands, imitating the patterns of actual garments and possibly a surplice worn by the portrait subject himself. Jofu's image is accompanied by a fly whisk (hossu) and, on certain occasions, a cloth cap (mosu), both of which signify the extroverted and dynamic role of the monk as a teacher qua bodhisattva.3 Naturalistic in volume and proportion, the near-life-size figure composes a pyramid that focuses attention on the palpably human, even beautiful, face (Fig. 4). The monk's rounded countenance, with slightly swelling eyelids, strong jawline, creases alongside the mouth, and a pronounced Adam's apple, gazes downward, his dark pupils focusing on the viewer with calm attentiveness. His firmly closed mouth is surrounded by gray stubble that lends the elderly face an earthy, proximate humanity. Below the head, the monk's broad shoulders descend to deeply carved sleeves that gather and bunch along the forearms, as real fabric might, and cascade downward on each side of the figure. The ring and cord securing his surplice are sculpted in high relief, the former decorated with a simple arabesque, while the garment sinks in a concave arc across the legs before falling over the rounded knees in alternating, asymmetrical folds. His hands curl into convincing fists, the right grasping the whisk.

With its impressive priestly appearance and empathetically accessible human features and proportions, the statue fulfills the mimetic and ideologi- cal functions we expect of a portrait of an eminent temple founder and patriarch. Chins6 Studies and a Peculiar Portrait The Korin'in statue of Jofu belongs to a genre of Buddhist portraiture lumped together by most modern writers under the term chinso (chinzo).4 In recent years, chinso have acquired new visibility in academic discourse, the museum, and the classroom.5 Long-overdue attention is now being paid, for example, to portraits of Zen abbesses.6 In part because of interdisciplinary exchanges with scholars of Buddhism, moreover, art historians have begun to reappraise the visual, ritual, and contextual negotiations that chinso embody be- yond the assumption of accurate likeness and its revelation of interior self. Nevertheless, traditional narratives remain the norm in art historical literature: portraits are dated; the careers of sub- jects and artists are retrieved; iconography is enumerated; sculptural technique is analyzed; formal qualities are de- scribed; inscriptions are deciphered; and statements are made regarding a subject's personality and spirituality as revealed by the portrait object. Although these concerns are not to be dismissed (and I have engaged them above), many accounts treat chinso as self-contained objects of aesthetic evaluation and render them isolated from architectural spaces and social and ritual environments.7 While art historians have studied the "interior adornment" (zonai shogon) and conse- crated objects (zonai nonyu-hin) found in some chinso statues,8 we remain preoccupied with biography, attribution, and the achievement of verisimilitude. In fact, the dramatic facial naturalism of many chinso, their physiognomic "realism," has been taken by many art historians as evidence of penetrating resemblance to the sitter and a certain moment or process of fabrication involving intimate exchange between subject and artist; if posthumous, a realistic portrait is presumed to have been produced soon after the sitter's death.9 In much of the literature, such resemblance not only becomes the principal agent of a given portrait's identity but also, especially in painted works, is linked to what many view as chinso portrai- ture's dual functions as certificate of enlightenment and proof of the "mind-to-mind" transmission of the Dharma (Buddhist Law) between masters and disciples, notions now challenged by several Buddhologists.10 In the traditional art historical view, such unflinching description of physiognomic form and its direct association with mystical spiritual experi- ence make the portrait "Zen." For many art historians, and not without some justification, study of chinso, and portraiture in general, is predicated on the assumption of a fixed identity, a singular, distinguishable human subject who glides across the temporal chasm through the articulation and mediation of physiognomic likeness and social form. Even if a portrait's unique identity is lost due to the waning of memory and historical circumstance, that identity can often be retrieved and reestablished, in turn relieving the peculiar anxiety we feel toward portraits that have lost their names. As we will see, such assumptions regarding portrait identity and representational form do not always hold true, especially in Buddhist contexts. Scholars of Buddhism have taken a rather different ap- proach to chinso, and their arguments are illuminating. One aim of their writings has been to remove from the study of chinso, and icons generally, residues of modern art historical inquiry (the emphasis on realism and the sequential ordering of aestheticallyjudged objects) to reveal the underlying cultic values, miraculous presences, and doctrinal and ritual impera- tives or fluctuations of such images. These authors have made us acutely aware of the functions of chinso as richly synec- dochic/metonymic doubles and "live portraits of dead mas- ters" rather than simple metaphoric symbols; in this sense, the K6rin'in statue is not merely, or essentially, a realistic representation ofJofu, it isJofu.11 They have also addressed the interrelationships among portraits, mummies, and relics, the Chan/Zen tradition of portrait halls, the "true" portrait and self within the Buddhist ontology of Emptiness, and the ideoogical positions toward representation from which chinso subjects, inscribers, and commentators often regarded portraits.</page><page sequence="4">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 75 4 Portrait Statue of ShokeiJofu, detail of head and torso In what follows, I draw from traditional art historical narratives and respond to some of the Buddhologists' argu- ments. My chief aim, however, is to shift the K6rin'in statue out of a narrowly descriptive and historically rigid examina- tion by adopting an approach similar to that employed in Richard Davis's elegant Lives of Indian Images (1997), in which the biographies of images are traced through time and place and related to the devotional expectations and ways of seeing of particular "communities of response."12 The need for such a method became clear following my discovery with Korin'in's present abbot of an inscription hidden within the Korin'in statue that reveals the portrait to be far less ingenuous than it appears. The inscription informs us that the statue has undergone a switch of site and identity. It was moved from one temple into another and, in the process, transformed from a portrait of one abbot into that of another without a corresponding sculptural "change of face." These events, to the extent that they can be retrieved, confound the conven- tional expectation that a portrait, through its grasp of specific physiognomy, is an immediate and reliable representation of a singular human subject. What becomes clear is not simply that the portrait is rhetorically active but also that there is a</page><page sequence="5">76 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 1 5 Portrait Painting of ShokeiJofu, autographic inscription dated 1536. K6rin'in (photo: courtesy of Mainichi Shinbunsha, Tokyo) frailty to likeness and an unfolding, sequential quality to identity. By positing a portrait whose site and identity have been in flux, however, I am not proposing a purely decentered object, a portrait whose expressive form did not matter to its audiences, or an image for which the recognition of identity was not acutely significant. Indeed, I argue that the portrait's specific visual presence has been of the utmost importance to its communities. Beyond this single case, moreover, and to avoid its oversingularization, I am also interested in the movements that icons, especially portraits, underwent during their lives and the multifaceted and malleable formation and experience of visual and material identity. Expected Sites and Settings Korin'in is one of twenty-three subtemples (tatchu) located within Daitokuji.13 Established in the fourteenth century by Shuho Myocho (Daito Kokushi, 1282-1337), Daitokuji be- came one of the country's most prestigious religious institu- tions. Like other Zen monasteries, it combines a core of ceremonial buildings in its precinct with surrounding clusters of subsidiary temples. Korin'in, located in the southern area of the monastery, exemplifies a pattern of subtemple establish- ment during the sixteenth century when warrior patronage transformed the monastery into an umbrella for lay mortuary sites inaugurated with prominent Daitokuji monks as their founding abbots.14 Following convention, Korin'in took its name from the Buddhist title of Hatakeyama Yoshifusa, its initial patron and mortuary subject: K6rin'inden den'o tokuin. Its function as a Hatakeyama memorial site is echoed today by spirit tablets (ihai) of Yoshifusa and other family members placed on the altar and portrait paintings of Yoshifusa and a descendant Hatakeyama Yoshiaki kept in the temple storehouse.15 The temple acquired a second mortuary function when it became Jofu's "stupa site" (tassho) following his death in 1536. Soon thereafter, a portrait painting ofJofu, inscribed by the subject himself, was installed in the altar as the focal point for memorial rites (Fig. 5).16 Korin'in's prominence during the sixteenth century is suggested by donation records that name the Hatakeyama and other patrons and by legal codes (kinzei) issued at the temple's request by military administrators.17 In 1577, how- ever, the Noto Hatakeyama were destroyed by armies of Uesugi Kenshin (1530-1578), thus ending their patronage of Korin'in. Then, during the 1580s, the warrior Maeda Toshiie (1538-1599) revived the temple as a mortuary site for his father, Toshimasa, and other family members.18 By the Edo period (1615-1868), K6rin'in had become a relatively prosper- ous urban temple that functioned as a compound mortuary site for the Hatakeyama, the Maeda, and its founding abbot Jofu.19 During the Meiji era (1868-1912), the temple served temporarily as a hospital before falling into disrepair.20 In 1909 it was revived and reidentified as Ryoshoji, a site of potent patriarchal significance to Daitokuji.21 Then, in 1922, following the construction of a new Ryoshdji precinct nearby, the temple reverted to its former identity as K6rin'in. A reminder of this institutional do-si-do is the temple bell (densho) cast for Ryosh6ji's precinct in western Kyoto, which continues to hang at K6rin'in.22 Visitors to K6rin'in today, encounter the founder's statue within the temple's most important structure, the abbot's quarters (hojo), which dates from about 1533-52 and is one of the oldest extant buildings of its type (Fig. 6).23 Repaired and</page><page sequence="6">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 77 restored between 1975 and 1978, the single-story, post-and- lintel building, with its elegant hipped-and-gabled roof, ad- heres to an architectural plan employed throughout Dai- tokuji. The interior, its floors largely covered with woven reed mats (tatami), is divided into eight rooms partitioned by sliding door panels (fusuma) (Fig. 7). The rooms, configured to serve ritual, social, and residential functions, were once decorated with fusuma paintings by Kano Motonobu (1476- 1559).24 The building's core combines an altar room (butsuma) and an adjacent chapel (shitchu). The chapel, analogous to the outer sanctuary (gejin) of a Buddhist image hall, served as a ritual and devotional stage where the commemorations of the traditional Buddhist calendar were observed and where various rites were conducted on behalf of lay patrons and members of the Daitokuji lineage. These events, whose protocol is outlined in monastic codes and echoed in eulogies preserved in discourse records, were directed toward icons installed in the altar. The most important rites were mortuary in character: annual memorials (nenki hoy) for Daitokuji's patriarchs Xutang Zhiyu (1185-1269), Nanpo Jmyo (1235- 1309), and Shuho Myocho; memorials for the founderJofu; and funerals (sogi) and memorials for later abbots, monks, and lay patrons (danka). The altar room at Korin'in corresponds to the inner sanctuary (naijin) of a larger devotional hall and is the sacred realm of Buddhas, patriarchs, and lay ancestors (Figs. 8, 9). It is dominated by the portrait ofJofu, a figure perceived to be equal in enlightenment to Sakyamuni, which is joined by icons of the Buddha and the bodhisattva Kannon as well as a forest of spirit tablets for lay and monastic figures. Outside the altar room, brocade altar curtains and cloths frame the statue and an ornate table presents offerings of light, incense, flowers, tea, and food appropriate to Buddhist ritual practice 6 Abbot's quarters, Korin'in, ca. 1533-52, (photo: courtesy of Korin'in and Kyoto Prefectural Board of Education) and to the evocation of transcendent space through "sacred adornment" (shogon) (Fig. 10). Dwelling within and dominat- ing this numinous, ornamented space, the founder's portrait occupies the abbot's quartersjust as its subject,Jofu, did in life and has become, since his death, the temple's visual, ritual, and ideological focal point. Portraits Seen and Not Seen The historical record is surprisingly reticent regarding the ritual and social life of K6rin'in, when and by whom portraits of its founder were viewed and venerated, and what types of response were generated between these images and indi- vidual observers. During the sixteenth century, Korin'in's function was principally that of a private memorial temple for its warrior sponsors and a mausoleum maintained by Jofu's monastic lineage.

The Edo period, meanwhile, witnessed greater permeabil- ity between public and private at Daitokuji, a phenomenon echoed in accounts of the monastery's history and descrip- tions of its architecture, icons, and art appearing in popularly published texts. Although I have yet to come across direct references toJofu's portrait at K6rin'in, Edo guidebooks and gazetteers suggest the expanding public knowledge of the temple's history and contents. Kurokawa Doyu's calendar of annual events in Kyoto, the Hinami kiji (1685), lists the memorial for Maeda Toshiie held at Korin'in, while the author's Kyoto gazetteer, Yoshu fushi (1686), adds references to the graves of Hatakeyama Yoshifusa, other Hatakeyama family members, and Maeda Toshiaki.25 K6rin'in's fusuma paintings are enumerated in the Daitokuji gazetteers Hozan shisho (1720) and Murasakino Daitokuji meisaiki (1811) and advertised in the well-known Kyoto guidebooks Miyako meisho zue (1780) and Miyako rinsen meisho zue (1799).26 In 1641, increased access to Korin'in, and perhaps concern over its impact on the temple's ritual life, may have led the temple to hang a plaque that prohibited copying of the fusuma paint- 10 Offering table, abbot's quarters, Korin'in ings decorating the abbot's quarters.27 Inventories of K6rin'in, meanwhile, indicate thatJofu's portrait remained an iconic focus in the temple well into the nineteenth century.28 Today, K6rin'in remains an active religious site, and its portraits of Jofu and other icons are subject to proprietary control. As Nishikawa Kyotaro warns readers of his 1976 survey of chinso statuary, access to a founder's image depends on etiquette and attitude; as he puts it, one requests to "worship" (ogamu) rather than "respectfully view" (haiken).29 Access also varies according to the viewer's relationship to the temple as monastic "family member," lay adherent, tourist, or special guest, and involves the mediation of social, economic, and ritual behaviors as well as spatial and decora- tive environments.30 The temple is closed to the general public, but special spring and autumn openings allow visitors to view Jofu's statue at a distance, from the veranda of the abbot's quarters, where guides recount the monk's biography and articulate his role as Dharma leader and temple founder. Although a sense of magical, iconic presence may be lost to many contempo- rary visitors, some comment that they are struck by Jofu's spiritual achievements as well as the statue's striking facial features and antiquity. Members of Korin'in's congregation, meanwhile, gain greater proximity to the statue through their participation in rituals performed in the chapel, notably, the annual founder's memorial. Strictly speaking, only the abbot and his assistants enter the icon's immediate space at this time, but other participants may approach the image for offerings and prayer. For many lay adherents, the statue is no doubt of considerable devotional interest and has significant affective and didactic impact; through the structure of the ritual environment and the regal and physiognomically strik- ing portrait, they encounter the illustrious teacher, sense his spiritual consciousness and authority, and affirm the prestige of his temple and legacy. Like other icons within temple settings, the statue continues to serve as a means to acquire blessing and deepen awakening. If ritual and devotion promote particular ways of looking and expectations, historical inquiry prompts other acts of viewing and different desires. In 1993 I sent a letter to the temple requesting permission to study its chinso portraits. Although such requests by art historians are often declined</page><page sequence="8">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 79 (and some temples ignore them), K6rin'in's present abbot, Fukushiro Yodo, welcomed my inquiry.31 Arriving with a small gift, camera equipment, tape measure, and notepad, I was permitted to study and photograph several painted portraits, which the abbot spread out on the tatami in a beautiful reception room. I then asked to view the founder's statue. Although my initial request to photograph this image was tolerated with discomfort, I was gradually allowed to move closer to the statue and perform more intrusive photography. As I faced the portrait, it appeared animate, as ifJofu himself was seated before me, the boundary between posthumous representation and living subject collapsing momentarily.32 We might also note how Jofu's statue has-or rather has not-been "seen" within the field of art history. It is quite clear that the statue has received little attention so far in Japan. Specialists involved with the survey of Kyoto temple and shrine treasures conducted from 1941 to 1945 (Kyotofu jiinjuho chosa) tersely identified the statue as a portrait ofJofu produced from the late Muromachi to the early Edo period but found it otherwise unremarkable.33 The statue is likewise identified as Jofu in a 1978 survey of portrait sculpture in Kyoto.34 Several photographs of the portrait appear in the report prepared by Kyoto Prefecture following repair of Korin'in's abbot's quarters.35 Nowhere, however, do we find evidence that a thorough examination of the statue (both inside and out) has been conducted. Why, we might ask, is this the case? The production of portraits of patriarchs, abbots, and abbesses has been an intensive preoccupation of the Chan/ Zen Buddhist tradition from its earliest moments and has continued into the present despite the tradition's aniconic rhetoric.36 The study of Zen portraiture, itself a certain preoccupation of art historians, was begun by Japanese scholars before World War II and has continued inJapan and internationally since. Much of the scholarship on chinso reflects the effects of modern aesthetic valuation (icons evaluated as "art"), periodization (religious art seen as a "medieval" field with later eras discounted), and canoniza- tion (including the selection of National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties). The bulk of writings thus comprise what might be called "masterpiece" studies con- cerned with "the best" examples dating to a "golden age" spanning the thirteenth to early fifteenth centuries.37 Among these "classic" statues are portraits of Muhon Kakushin (1286, at the temple Kokokuji), Mukan Fumon (after 1291, at the subtemple Ryiugin'an), and Chikotsu Daie (after 1312, at the temple Hokokuji), all of which are well published and praised for their extraordinary naturalism and evocative expression of interiority. Most can elicit even in modern viewers an eerie feeling of discomfort. This is not to say that these famous portraits do not deserve attention or that all questions surrounding them have been resolved, but predisposition toward early images of particular form and provenance has consigned to art historical obscurity huge numbers of portraits, including that ofJofu at K6rin'in. Despite their cultic significance, these mostly later portraits are generally valued only as documents of historical subjects, for their calligraphic inscriptions, or for an occasional artist's signature. Most are viewed as the atrophied legacy of an illustrious portrait tradition. With a notable few exceptions, they remain unstudied, absent from glossy exhibition cata- logues and art books, and excluded from the prestigious domains of the Japanese Cultural Properties System. As casualties of stylistic orders, canonization, and the "repres- sion" of ritual and magical significance, these later chinso have thus suffered the effects of the "modern gaze."38 Neverthe- less, they present diverse iconographies, styles, functions, and histories that we need to account for in our efforts to grapple with the visual, doctrinal, and contextual negotiations that chinso express and undergo. Like most large Zen monasteries, Daitokuji preserves a small group of ancient portraits, most of which are designated National Treasures or Important Cultural Properties. This canon includes painted portraits of the Chinese patriarchs Yunan Buyan (1218) and Xutang Zhiyu (1265), which are among the oldest extant examples of chinso. Also prominent are portraits of Daitokuji's Japanese forebear Nanpo Jomyo, the monastery's founder Myocho, the Muromachi period abbot Ikkyi Sojun (1394-1481), and the Edo master Takuan Soho (1573-1645).39 This, of course, is merely the tip of the iceberg. Less visible and hardly acknowledged in scholarship are literally hundreds of abbot paintings and statues at Daitokuji dating from the sixteenth to the twentieth centu- ries.40 The most visible of these portraits, it should be added, are the more than twenty statues of founding abbots en- shrined at the monastery's subtemples that date predomi- nantly from the seventeenth century down to the present.41 Like many of these statues, the K6rin'in portrait is less dramatically carved and less exquisitely colored than many of its sculptural ancestors. Nevertheless, it remains a sensitively lifelike image that affirms a specific visual tradition and involved great effort and care in production and, undoubt- edly, considerable expense. We might counter complaints about its diluted naturalism and stylized description by questioning whether premodern (and most modern) viewers experienced the portrait as diminished (visually, devotionally, or philosophically) because of its sculptural style. Equally open to question is the assumption that the statue's identity is transparently and unitarily determined by the fact or quality of its facial representation. A Problematic Sighting, an Unexpected Site The protocol of art historical viewing compels us to raise questions concerning documentation and attribution, to seek linear measurements, and to be accountable to other catego- ries of confirmable data. As historian rather than supplicant, I asked Korin'in's abbot if the statue of Jofu had an interior inscription (zonai meibun) and learned that he had never looked inside the image. Such inscriptions, brushed onto the interiors of hollow portrait statues, frequently identify the subject, patron, and sculptor, as well as give the date and site of enshrinement. Along with other types of dedicatory text, they played a role in a statue's transformation from inert material into empowered, animate presence effected through acts of consecration, including "eye-opening" rites (kaigen kuyo, tengen butsuji) in which the pupils were dotted to activate the icon, accompanied by the chanting of spells (darani) and merit dedications (eko).42 These rites are well known for statues of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and other deities, and in 1533Jofu composed a verse for the eye opening of the main</page><page sequence="9">80 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 1 11 Portrait Statue of Shorei Sokin, detail of head with inscription, 1682. Kyoto,Jukoin (photo: courtesy ofJukoin and Kyoto Prefectural Board of Education) image of Sakyamuni at K6rin'in.43 They were also conducted for portrait statues and paintings. The discourse record of the monk Gokei Soton (1416-1500), for example, records a verse for an eye opening performed for a statue of Sekko Soshin (1408-1486), and Mujaku Dochu's (1653-1744) Shobozanshi, a gazetteer of the Kyoto monastery Myoshinji, reports an eye opening held in 1693 for a statue of the founder of the subtemple Reiun'in, Daikyu Sokyu (1468-1549).44 Inscriptions appear routinely on the interior of the detach- able, hollow heads of wood portrait statues and usually follow a conventional order, beginning with the subject's name or title, followed by the name of the patron or sculptor, the date of production, and the inscriber's name (Fig. 11).45 Often they recount the production of the statue on the anniversary of the subject's death and its installation at his or her mausoleum, thereby expressing the vital linkage between portraits, mortuary sites, and memorial commemoration.46 The inscriber was generally the abbot or abbess of the temple where the image was installed and a Dharma descendant of the portrait subject. The statue of Takuan Soh6 enshrined in 1646 at the Daitokuji branch temple Nanshfiji in Sakai on Takuan's first death anniversary, for example, was inscribed by Nanshfiji's abbot and Takuan's Dharma nephew, Ten'yu Jok6 (d. 1666), a monk who will figure prominently in the following narrative.47 The portrait's interior inscription may therefore express personal and institutional bonds between subject and inscriber and reinforce the domains of religious lineage and ideology. Locating the inscription within the head suggests the fundamental link between this part of the sculpted figure and the expression and reception of identity.48 The inscription names the object precisely where we most often visually and psychologically apprehend a person's subjectivity and attach a name. Still, the inscribed name becomes hidden from view when the head is seated on the statue's torso, the text interred within the statue like a relic. In one sense, the inscription is a relic of the inscriber that is conjoined with the portrait, another relic, and exchanged for an identification with, and the charisma of, the portrait's patriarchal subject.49 Once the inscription and name are hidden by the closing of the statue, they may be known by reopening the body or may reverberate through external records, ritual performance, and oral transmission. If a statue was never opened, if external narratives were to cease, and if the portrait's surrounding institutional setting was disrupted, the inscription might be forgotten and the statue's identity lost until the text was brought again to light. In most cases, the revealing of such an inscription would be a momentous event that affirmed the image's power and sacred history, but such discoveries may also have unexpected consequences. During a visit to Korin'in inJuly 1998, I was allowed to make a thorough inspection of Jofu's portrait. The abbot and I entered the abbot's quarters, where he proceeded into the altar room, stood before the statue ofJofu, and brought his palms together in the gesture of respect (gassho). Quietly, he spoke to the statue to request its pardon (using the common polite phrase "shitsurei shimasu") and then ascended to the altar platform. Placing his hands on each side of the head, he lifted it gently from the torso and then stepped down from the altar.50 My anticipation of ritual behavior during this event was exaggerated. No formal "eye closing" was conducted to prepare the icon, and the informally dressed abbot offered only a simple expression of respect before dismembering the statue. Perhaps this diminution of ritual reflected the unoffi- cial nature of the event. Or it may have been an accommoda- tion made for art historical investigation.51 At the time, however, I made a note that in addressing the statue, the abbot spoke directly toJofu. The abbot carried the detached head to an adjoining room, leaving the decapitated torso behind, and placed it on a sheet of white paper on the tatami (Figs. 12, 13). Holding a flashlight so that it shone into the head's narrow opening, I peered down the hollow neck and saw at the top of the concave interior an inscription written in four lines (Fig. 14). Due to the curvature of the interior, however, only part of the text was visible: "[Located] within Daitokuji [-] / The Founding Abbot of Baigan'an [-] / The Great Patron [-]/ Donated [-]." Wholly unexpected, the inscription revealed, we believe, that the statue had been sculpted not as a portrait of Korin'in's founding abbot but, rather, as a portrait of the founder of a site called Baigan'an.52 The face gazing down at us from the altar was transformed suddenly from the founder Jofu into someone else. The question was, who? Gazetteers, temple documents, and other sources reveal that Baigan'an was a subtemple established at Daitokuji in 1643, more than a century after K6rin'in. Today, however, it no longer survives. Its founding abbot, the aforementioned Ten'yuJoko, was affiliated with Daitokuji's so-called Daisen'in lineage descending from the monk Kogaku Soko (1465- 1548).53 Korin'in's founder, Jofu, in contrast, belonged to the monastery's so-called Ryogen'in lineage descending from</page><page sequence="10">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 81 12 Portrait Statue of ShokeiJfu, detail of head Tokei Soboku (d. 1517).54 Thus, not only was Ten'yu distant chronologically from Jofu, he also resided on a different, branch of Daitokuji's "family tree." Baigan'an was initially established by a Kyoto merchant named Tomomatsu Soyu as a mortuary site for his father. Just as K6rin'in became an abbot's mausoleum following Jofu's death, Baigan'an similarly became Ten'yu's burial site and protected the monk's stupa. In a map of Daitokuji completed in about 1702 (Murasakino Ryuhozan Daitokuzenji ezu) (Fig. 15) and a popularly printed map published in 1825 (Fig. 16), Baigan'an occupies a large precinct at the northwest corner of the monastery.55 Little is known about the precinct, but like Daitokuji's other subtemples it included an abbot's quarters, which, according to Edo-period gazetteers, was decorated with lavish fusuma paintings.56 The statue of Baigan'an's founder Ten'yu was no doubt commissioned following his death in 1666, perhaps under the direction of the temple's third abbot, ShokaiJoso (d. 1667), the second abbot having preceded Ten'yu in death.57 In- scribed, installed, and activated, it would have been wor- shiped during ensuing memorial observances and functioned as a participant in the ongoing life of the temple. The sculptor's identity remains a mystery, but a certain Tanehisa (fl. mid-seventeenth century) is a possible candidate since his name appears in inscriptions on at least eight portrait statues in Kyoto dating from the 1650s to the 1670s.58 Five of the eight statues depict Zen abbots, including a portrait of Jitsuden Soshin (1434-1507) at the Daitokuji subtemple Yotokuin dated 1656.59 While Tanehisa's connection to the Korin'in statue remains unconfirmed, it seems clear that Daitokuji's seventeenth-century abbot statues were produced by professional Buddhist sculptors linked with established traditions and workshops. To produce Ten'yu's posthumous portrait statue, the sculp- tor might have referred to existing painted portraits, sketches, and possibly verbal descriptions. One possible model is the painted portrait of Ten'yu produced during his lifetime and now preserved at the Daitokuji subtemple Sangen'in (Fig. 20).60 Studying this painted portrait, which Ten'yu himself inscribed, we find a significant degree of facial resemblance to the K6rin'in statue, including stubble on the chin. The statue's features are markedly different, however, from those of the self-inscribed, painted portrait of Jofu preserved at Korin'in, which depicts the sitter with a flat cranium and angular features (Fig. 5). Such portrait-to-portrait compari- sons do not prove or disprove the mimetic accuracy of a portrait's rendering of physiognomy and more often reveal conventions of facial description, costume, and composition, not to mention art historical method. Nevertheless, these comparisons are significant because they suggest a consensus of represented form between the statue at K6rin'in and the painting of Ten'yu and a discrepancy between the statue and the painted portrait ofJofu.61 To see and document the K6rin'in statue's inscription fully would require use of an endoscope, not uncommon in the study of Buddhist statuary, to look down the narrow tube of the neck into the dark interior of the head.62 Since K6rin'in's abbot would not permit a procedure of such invasiveness, however, phone calls were not made to curators at Kyoto National Museum or to a local gastroenterologist. Rather than presenting wondrous evidence that the abbot might wish to proclaim publicly (to the devotional and economic benefit of his temple), the inscription revealed a disconcerting turn of events with potentially disruptive consequences for the ongoing ritual and social life of the temple: in one sense, an imposter now inhabited K6rin'in's abbot's quarters. Thus,</page><page sequence="11">82 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 1 14 Portrait Statue of ShokeiJofu, detail of opening at neck 13 Portrait Statue of ShokeiJofu, detail of head while a photograph of the complete inscription would clarify a number of questions and have evidentiary value for publica- tion, I could not assert this art historical objective in the face of the abbot's concerns. Inability to fully document the inscription should not, however, prevent further exploration of the statue's history, and we might appraise this predica- ment for what it suggests about the divide between the historian's eye and the devotional eye.63 Moving Images A scenario thus begins to take shape: the statue of Ten'yu, commissioned following his death in 1666 and installed at Baigan'an, was later reinstalled into a new iconic space at Korin'in, where it became a portrait of the abbot Jofu. Numerous questions then come to mind. When did the relocation take place, and who carried it out? What motiva- tions and factors allowed disengagement of the icon from one site and reinsertion into another? How was the statue trans- formed from one abbot into another? Two trajectories might be traced here: one physical, in which the statue was dislo- cated from Baigan'an and moved to K6rin'in, and one ritual and perceptual, whereby the portrait's identity as Ten'yu was replaced with that of Jofu. Fragments of evidence can be found for both, and I shall begin by trying to unravel the former: How did an icon of significance and specificity to one temple shift into another site with which the portrait subject, and the portrait's primary community, had no direct institu- tional and spiritual connection? How often did portraits move about like this, and what does such movement imply? Despite romanticized notions of ancient statues, paintings, and other art objects resting for time immemorial in their original settings, the phenomena of dislocation, appropria- tion, and destruction are as enduring and recurrent in Japanese art as in other cultures. The passionate drive of practitioners of the "tea ceremony" (chanoyu) to acquire utensils through discovery, purchase, or confiscation, for example, generated sensational histories of shifting posses- sion associated with predigreed treasures.64 In the culture of tea, the identities of many objects thus accrued through their very transience of location and ownership. Equally intriguing is evidence found in the Kanmon gyoki, diary of the Fushimi Prince Sadafusa (1372-1456), of the borrowing, dislocation, and circulation of narrative picture scrolls (emaki).65 As the dispersal of buildings from Toyotomi Hideyoshi's (1536- 1598) Fushimi castle in about 1622 suggests, architectural treasures too were moved, reacquired, and reused, and great prestige and rhetorical potential might be claimed by those who were gifted with a hall, a gate, or even a piece of ornament from such monuments.66 We are less accustomed, perhaps, to viewing Buddhist icons as subject to fluid shifts in ownership or outright rupture and destruction, and there are various reasons for this. The close identification of icons with individual sites, derived initially through enshrinement and miraculous occurrences, has an ancient history, and the sacred powers of these images within their cultic environments, together with their association with death, created protective buffers that thwarted violation and</page><page sequence="12">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 83 4 a. * t~ t I; 4'- c*? -"-4 11 . 15 Map of Daitokuji, ca. 1702.

Kyoto Prefectural Library and Archive (photo: courtesy of Kyoto Prefectural Library and Archive) displacement.67 The guarding and intensification of iconic power within temple settings is evident in the worship of "secret Buddhas" (hibutsu), hidden images revealed only at specified intervals, thereby enhancing the object's power and mystery within its site and the prestige and financial status of its temple owner.68 Such potent site-image relationships were amplified and advertised in early modern guidebooks and other vernacular sources as part of their promotion of knowledge of and fascination with the religious, cultural, and commercial landscape. One might also suggest that this popularization of autochthony lingers in modern usage in our shorthand naming of images by their temples, such as the "Seiryoji Shaka." While it is undeniable that numerous statues and paintings have resided continuously within individual sacred sites, where they have maintained specific visual and ritual pres-</page><page sequence="13">84 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 1 ence, we must be wary of a presumption of immutable permanence. The exoticizing attitudes of Euro-American viewers in the late nineteenth century and thereafter, in addition to the ideologically motivated creation and promo- tion of tradition by temples as well as local and national governments, encourage us to perceive Buddhist images as knotted tightly into the consistent weave of an enduring historical fabric. But it is abundantly clear from the written record and from objects themselves that this fabric at times has been torn, patched, and even rewoven.69 Temples moved, as did their icons, but not always together or in favorable circumstances. Icons were relocated by human agents (independent from their own miraculous movements) and redistributed amid changing political, doctrinal, and cultural conditions. There is a long history of disruptions of sacred sites and dispersals of icons, and one of its principal manifestations is the phenomenon of "Guest Buddhas" (kyakubutsu), displaced icons who have found adoptive homes in neighboring or even distant temples.70 Dislocation also occurred when Buddhist sutras and commentaries were cut up, dispersed, and sometimes reformatted in calligraphy model books (tekagami).71 Andrew Watsky's research on the Tsukubusuma Shrine demonstrates how religious buildings were dismantled and removed from their precincts and reconstructed within other sites differing in institutional and ritual character.72 Iconic dislocation is an enduring part of Daitokuji. No doubt the most famous case of disruption, and indeed destruction, involved the portrait statue of the tea master Sen no Rikyu (1522-1591) enshrined as a patron's image in the upper story of Daitokuji's Sanmon Gate in 1589. Its installa- tion an apparent transgression of status, the statue was removed in 1591 by Rikyu's patron, the ruler Hideyoshi, who ordered its crucifixion (haritsuke) and beheading at Midoriba- shi in Kyoto, an incident followed by the tea master's enforced suicide elsewhere in the city.73 Almost as famous is the removal from Daitokuji of twelve scrolls from the one hun- dred scroll set of the Five Hundred Luohans (1178) painted by Zhou Jichang and Lin Tinggui, which were sold to the collector Charles Freer (1854-1919) and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1894, an event that intertwined the dubious motivations of both Ernest Fenollosa (1853-1908) and the monastery.74 While this fracture has a particularly modern edge to it, the circulation of these iconic images was evident long before the nineteenth century and the treasure-hunting activities of foreign and Japanese collectors. Imported to Japan in the thirteenth century, they were initially treasures of the temple Jufukuji in Kamakura. Later, they were moved to Sounji by the Hojo warrior family. In the sixteenth century, they were taken from eastern Japan as "spoils of war" by Hideyoshi, who placed them in his grand temple, Hokoji, in Kyoto.75 The Luohans were then deposited at the Daitokuji subtemple Soken'in, which Hideyoshi had sponsored for the posthumous salvation of his predecessor, Oda Nobunaga (1534-1582).76 Clearly, we need to look not only at sensational rupture and outright destruction but also at broader patterns of move- ment (associated with pious donation as well as colonial plunder), the willing receipt of objects in circulation, and the tension existing between and within these phenomena. Dai- tokuji, for its part, was frequently a ready recipient of images even when a quid pro quo was inevitably involved. The Five Hundred Luohans were acquired by Daitokuji from Hideyoshi in the context of his patronage of the monastery, as were three ancient chinso portraits of Yunan Buyan, Xutang Zhiyu, and NanpoJomyo.77 Hideyoshi's donations of these treasured luohan (arhat) and patriarch images were at one level acts of piety, but this in no way negates the power they wielded on his behalf, not only in the numinous presences of the images themselves but also in their role as a kind of iconic bait used by Hideyoshi to lure Daitokuji into his political program, an agenda reflected as well in his establishment of the sub- temples Soken'in and Tenzuiji. Another circumstance that promoted the circulation of images was their supplanting by works commissioned by new benefactors: when Tokugawa Ietsuna (1641-1680) had a new statue of Sakyamuni com- pleted for Daitokuji's newly reconstructed Buddha Hall in 1667, the preceding building's icon was displaced (exiled), first to the subtemple Tenzuiji and then to the branch temple T6kaiji in Kanagawa.78 Alongside the gifting activities of secular patrons were temple efforts to channel and manage the movement of icons and treasures. Occasionally, monasteries permitted the sale of objects or buildings in order to raise funds for repair or the continuation of ritual duties.79 But voluminous administrative records reveal that tremendous energies and personnel were devoted to securing and protecting temple properties. At Daitokuji's subtemples, for example, we find numerous temple inventories (kyokatsucho). Those extant at Korin'in, dated to 1597, 1650, and 1866, enumerate with an accountant's preci- sion the contents of the abbot's quarters, including its icons and ritual paraphernalia, works of calligraphy, religious texts and philosophical books, decorative paintings, and residen- tial furnishings.80 Particular objects, notably patriarchal relics, were often the subject of individual directives. In 1507, for example, the Daitokuji abbot Jitsuden Soshin specified that the Dharma robe of Kaso Sodon (1352-1428) was to be carefully protected by his descendants and displayed only once each year.81 Despite the control implied by these records, icons and implements considered communal property and identified in monastic vernacular as "permanently residing objects" (joju- motsu) were removed or even disappeared under ambiguous circumstances. Included in temple regulations (kishiki) and written into inventories themselves were prohibitions such as the following: "These items may not be borrowed without permission. If lost, a report must be made to the temple finance officer (nassho)."82 As noted earlier, Korin'in prohib- ited the copying of its abbot's quarters' paintings, thereby prohibiting their removal even in facsimile form. Portrait paintings and statues of Daitokuji's abbots and patriarchs were surprisingly mobile. In 1319, a portrait painting of the patriarch Xutang Zhiyu was removed from Ryoshoji during a period of civil unrest and placed for safekeeping at the nearby temple Ninnaji.83 Patriarchal por- traits even appear to have circulated in an "art market." In 1459, according to the "Chronology of the Master Ikkyu [Sojun]" (Ikkyu osho nenpu), "Someone had for sale a Chinese [portrait] scroll of the master Xutang [Zhiyu]. At the [por- trait's] top was [Xutang's] autographic inscription.... The</page><page sequence="14">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 85 monk Kyii [Kesso Jokyu] quickly purchased the portrait and donated it to Shuon'an as a permanent temple possession."84 This account, from Ikkyui's sectarian biography, should be read not as the capture of a prized art object rather as an act of possessing the numinous presence of a patriarch who had unique meaning in Ikkyii's religious persona and thus for his community.85 As this episode suggests, the act and destination of chinso movement was often driven by the ideology of religious lineage. As cultic images, patriarchal portraits gravitated (as did patriarchal robes and other relics) toward sites founded by, or of significance to, the subject or where the presence of the subject's portrait "double" had ritual and ideological value for religious descendants. This was also the case with the self-inscribed portrait of Ikkyf that the abbot granted to his lay disciple Owa Sorin (d. 1501). Following Ikkyu's death, Sorin donated it to Ikkyu's mortuary site Shinjuan, where it became the temple's principal icon.86 Portraits of monks who did not establish temples or sublineages of their own, mean- while, frequently found their way into their teacher's temple or into the mausoleum of an important patriarch (as did their graves and relics).87 This practice transformed individual temples into repositories of portraits of multiple Dharma generations. The relocation of a portrait to enhance the authority of a particular religious line is especially evident in the case of the temple Ryoshoji. Between 1539 and 1541, Daitokuji went to great lengths to relocate Ryoshoji into its own precinct.88 Established in western Kyoto in 1309 as a mortuary site of Nanpo Jomyo, Ryoshoji had fallen into decline by the late fifteenth century. Control of the temple had special signifi- cance to Daitokuji because of Jomyo's authority as Shuho Myocho's teacher, and Daitokuji competed with other lines descending from Jomyo to rebuild and revive the site. In the process, Ryosh6ji's statue of Jomyo, inscribed in 1404 by the temple's abbot Sochin, was evacuated from its ravaged hall and moved to Daitokuji, where, according to one document, it "borrowed a seat [za wo karite]."89 Vanishing from Sight The second half of the nineteenth century witnessed unprec- edented separations of Buddhist images from temples, their outright destruction, and their dispersal into the growing art market-and it is here that we return to our present case.90 The dislocation of the Baigan'an statue from its site was a small but interesting ripple in the topos of Haibutsu kishaku, "the abolishing of Buddhism and the destruction of Sakya- muni," which traumatized the Buddhist institution during the first years of the Meiji era.91 Official "separation edicts" (Bunri rei) promulgated by the Meiji government from 1868, which followed anti-Buddhist policies put in force in Mito and other domains and the polemics of Nativist scholars such as Hirata Atsutane (1776-1843), led to rapid and dramatic fractures in the ritual, social, economic, and material identity of Buddhism. The institution faced the dismantling of Bud- dhist/Shinto syncretism, the renaming of deities and sites, the forced laicization of monks and nuns, the banning or circum- scription of Buddhist rites and pilgrimage, as well as the "breakup and amalgamation" of temples (jiin haigo). Temple economies were thrown into disarray with the replacement of the temple registration system with shrine registration, the disruption of congregations, and the confiscation and nation- alization of temple lands (jochi) based on surveys of shrine and temple properties conducted in 1869 and 1870.92 The impact of persecution on temples and their art and architecture is difficult to access, but the first decades of the Meiji era saw the destruction or decline of significant num- bers of buildings and the abandonment, sale, or secreting of many icons, sacred texts, and ritual implements.93 Ironically, efforts to identify and protect works of traditional art and architecture were developing at the same time but may not have had much effect until the enactment of the Law for the Preservation of Ancient Temples and Shrines (Koshaji hozonho) in 1897.94 In Kyoto the impact of persecution was less catastrophic than in other regions, but significant scars were left across the city's Buddhist landscape.95 Contemporary records speak of temples without abbots and congregations, Buddhist buildings within shrines torn down, temple halls in leaky disrepair, and icons sold off to antique dealers. Temples throughout the city were even ordered to contribute bronze images and implements to be melted down for use in the construction of an iron bridge crossing the Kamo River at Shij6. Portraits installed within temples as patriarchal or mortuary images were among the casualties of this period, but many survived by virtue of their significance as depictions of imperial and historical figures or through timely relocation and sale.96 Ninagawa Noritane's (1835-1882) diary, compiled during the national survey of shrine and temple treasures conducted in 1872, gives constant witness to abandoned or ruined temples; in one entry, he records a Kamakura-period portrait of the priest Ryoei Shonin, owned by Eikyuji, which was removed from its temple by a former priest and dispersed into the art market.97 Daitokuji did not suffer from the forcible dismantling of syncretic temple-shrine precincts or face destruction at the hands of anti-Buddhist mobs, but like Kyoto's other Zen monasteries its economic situation became grim, and numer- ous sites became haiji, "abandoned temples."98 Many sur- vived by being amalgamated institutionally and ritually with senior temples of the same lineage that had broader patron bases, a practice that also led to the transfer and preservation of icons and ritual objects.99 Nevertheless, Daitokuji's pre- cinct shrank dramatically in the first decades of Meiji as many subtemples were dismantled and their lands lost or sold off. Kyoto Prefectural Documents (Kyotofucho gyosei monjo) and other materials reveal that more than a dozen subtemples present in the 1825 map of Daitokuji (Fig. 16) disappeared in the 1870 and 1880s.100 The majority of these sites, including Baigan'an, were located in the western section of the monas- tery. Today this former area of Daitokuji is occupied by Murasakino High School, a junior high school for the blind, and a residential neighborhood, which surround a single surviving subtemple, Kohoan (Fig. 17).101 The only visible indications of Kohoan's once numerous subtemple neighbors are several granite posts including one identifying the former locations of Baigan'an and Sunshoan (Fig. 18). The systematic study of buildings, icons, and works of art dispersed from Daitokuji's haiji has yet to be done.102 One echo of the subtemple Sunshoan, established by the warrior Sakuma Masakatsu (1570-1643), is a group of decorated</page><page sequence="15">86 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 1 17 Present-day area of Baigan'an, Kyoto poem sheets still known as the Sunshoan shikishi, which preserve late eleventh-century calligraphy transcribing poems from the imperial anthology, Kokin wakashu. Acquired by Masakatsu from the temple Nanshuiji and deposited at Sun- shoan following his death, they eventually circulated into Japanese museums and private collections after the subtem- ple's closure.103 Fragments of round eave tiles (noki maruga- wara) decorated with the character Sun and originally from buildings at Sunshoan are embedded in the exterior wall of the subtemple Ryokoin (Fig. 19). What objects from Baigan'an survive, other than the statue at K6rin'in, remains to be seen, but I suspect that the painted portrait of Ten'yu Jok6 preserved today at Sangen'in, Ten'yu's lineage headquarters, was deposited there for safekeeping at the time of Baigan'an's closure (Fig. 20). Korin'in's tenuous condition during the Meiji era is indi- cated by the official explanation written in 1909 for the temple's reidentification as Ryosh6ji: Concerning the Re-naming of K6rin'in as Ryoshdji: Since there can be no expectation of Korin'in's future upkeep and the temple has already reached a state of dilapidation, it would be impossible to maintain in this condition for more than a year or two before it would inevitably end in closure. Ryoshoji, meanwhile, had the misfortune of losing its title and having its buildings sold off amid the chaos of the [Meiji] Restoration. As [Ryoshoji] was originally the place of practice of the founding abbot Dait6 Kokushi's teacher [that is, Nanpo Jomyo], its revival is imperative. [Accordingly,] after being refurbished, it [Korin'in] shall be renamed Ryoshoji and maintained as a branch temple of Daitokuji.104 Korin'in's decline had in fact begun prior to the Restoration, for the temple had already sold the fusuma paintings that once decorated its abbot's quarters,105 some of which have recently surfaced at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Seikado Bunko Art Museum, Tokyo.106 Although the circumstances of Baigan'an's demise remain unclear, documents in the Kyoto Prefectural Archive suggest that the temple disappeared in the 1870s. An 1870 register of Kyoto shrines and temples compiled by the prefecture lists 18 Modern stone marker identifying the former precincts of Baigan'an and Sunshoan. Kyoto Baigan'an as one of Daitokuji's active subtemples.107 A register of documents pertaining to temple appointments and retire- ments dated 1872, however, contains correspondence concern- ing the abbot of Baigan'an's desire to retire due to illness.108 Then, in a map of Daitokuji drawn up by the prefecture between 1875 and 1877, the temple has disappeared, its precinct marked with the notation "the former grounds of Baigan'an" (Baigan'an kyuchi) (Fig. 21).109 A survey of Kyoto's temples compiled between 1891 and 1902 includes a map of Daitokuji dated 1891 in which Baigan'an's former precinct is marked "land in the people's possession" (min yuchi).110 The fate of portraits owned by Daitokuji's subtemples that closed during this period is suggested by the cases of Soken'in, Tenzuiji, and Konryuin. Soken'in was established in 1582 by Hideyoshi as a mortuary site of Oda Nobunaga.l The temple was granted unprecedented financial support by Hideyoshi, served as the headquarters of the ruler's sprawling "Daitokuji Tea Gathering" in 1585, and continued to be among Kyoto's most famous sites well into the nineteenth century.112 During the first years of Meiji, however, its precinct was torn down and many of its treasures were moved to Daitokuji's main headquarters. Among them was a posthumous portrait statue of Nobunaga, which bears a dedicatory inscription dated 1583 (Fig. 22).113 Before the statue's removal, a number of viewers seem to have been struck by its sculpted features /I /'''-..,:. ^</page><page sequence="16">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT TIIE BUDDIIIST 'rEMPI,E KORIN'IN 87 19 Fragment of roof tile from Sunshoan, Edo period.

Touring Daitokuji in 1855, a pilgrim named Kiyo- kawa Hachiro wrote in his diary, Saiyuzso ("Account of a Journey to the West"): The next [place I visited] is called Soken'in, Nobunaga's temple. The wood image of Nobunaga, carved when Hideyoshi and others made incense offerings for Nobuna- ga's salvation, remains the main icon [enshrined] in the [altar's] center.

Exceptionally wealthy, like Soken'in, it had a magnifi- cent abbot's quarters with sumptuous interior paintings. The site was also visited by the pilgrim Kiyokawa, who wrote, "The next [place] is called Tenzuiji, the temple of Hideyoshi's mother... In the [altar's] center are paintings of Hideyoshi 20 Portrait Painting of Ten'yuJoko, autographic inscription dated 1646.

Kyoto, Soken'in and his mother."116 Just a few years later, in 1874, Tenzuiji joined the ranks of Daitokuji's haiji, and its abbot's quarters and kitchen-office buildings were torn down.117 The portraits referred to by Kiyokawa were transferred to Daitokuji's headquarters at this time; Tenzuiin's portrait, inscribed by Tenzuiji's abbot in 1615, is still displayed at Daitokuji's annual airing of treasures (bakuryo) and has also been exhibited abroad.118 Recently, scholars have discussed a painting in the Frank Lloyd Wright Collection that may have once been part of the program of sliding door paintings that originally decorated Tenzuiji's abbot's quarters.119 The fate of the founder's statue at Konryuin is of even greater interest. Constructed a few doors east of Baigan'an, Konryuin was established in 1597 by the monk ShogakuJoch6 (d. 1626) as the mortuary site of the warrior Kanamori Nagachika (d. 1608).120 In 1889, however, Konryuin was merged with the head subtemple of its lineage, Ryogen'in.121 Accompanying and embodying this merger was the relocation of Konryuin's founder's statue of Shogaku to the altar room at the abbot's quarters of Ryogen'in. Since Ryogen'in already enshrined a statue of its own founding abbot, T6kei Soboku, the doubling up of founder's statues was resolved by the construction of a subordinate niche for the portrait of Shogaku to the rear of the altar room behind Ryogen'in's own founder's image, the assimilated statue of Shogaku thus assuming a secondary cultic presence as a "Guest Buddha." Although positioned in the back of the building, the Kon- ryuin statue of Shogaku fit within its adoptive location at Ryogen'in precisely because of his identity as a Dharma descendant in the Ryogen'in lineage. It is important to note, however, that this was not the case with the shift of the statue of Ten'yu from Baigan'an into K6rin'in, two sites with different lineage affiliations. During the last decades of the nineteenth century, there- fore, we find various portraits on the move within Daitokuji. Baigan'an's closure at this time no doubt precipitated the dispersal of its iconic and artistic contents, including its</page><page sequence="18">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 89 founder's statue. What is not clear is how and why the statue ended up at K6rin'in as opposed to a senior subtemple of Baigan'an's own lineage, such as Sangen'in.122 There is evidence to suggest, however, that K6rin'in may have been "in the market" for a founder's statue at this time. Korin'in's temple inventories, dated 1597, 1650, and 1866, all com- mence with the icons enshrined in the abbot's quarters altar, among them a portrait painting of the temple's founder,Jofu. Conspicuous by its absence, however, is an entry for a portrait statue of Jofu. Judging from the inventories, therefore, the temple appears not to have enshrined a founder's statue at least until 1866. This is rather peculiar, due to the fact that from the Kan'ei era (1624-44) down to the eighteenth century, virtually all of Daitokuji's subtemples switched from the display of painted portraits of their founding abbots to sculpted images.123 In some cases, inventories and other documents indicate that the paintings were placed in storage following the installation of the newer statuary.124 This shift from two-dimensional painted portraits, usually produced during their subjects' lives, to new, volumetric, and posthu- mous statues suggests changing attitudes toward portrait veneration and had much to do, no doubt, with the creation and enhancement of the patriarchal past, a phenomenon that seems broadly evident within Daitokuji during the seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries.125 It also had an important architectural component; to accommodate and adorn these near-life-size statues, subtemple altar spaces were expanded from their originally narrow, rectangular plans scaled for the display of hanging scrolls into elaborately differentiated and decorated sculpture chapels (Fig. 23). This leads to further questions. Why did a change from painting to statue not take place at K6rin'in during the seventeenth century, as it had within most of Daitokuji's subtemples? Was the temple unable to commission a statue for financial reasons, or were there other mitigating circum- stances? Did the closing of Baigan'an unexpectedly allow Korin'in to effect the shift from painting to statue? And, most important, once relocated, how did the statue of Ten'yu become Korin'in's founder, Jofu? Looking Again The dislocation of the Baigan'an statue from its site and its movement across the monastery to Korin'in transpired in the late nineteenth century, but as yet there is no document, diary entry, or anything apparently on or in the statue through which to trace this move precisely and what it entailed logistically, ritually, and economically. Nor do echoes of the statue's transformation from Ten'yu Jok6 into Shokei Jofu reach us. For unlike the case of the Konryuin statue, adopted into Ryogen'in with its initial identity intact, the maintenance of the Baigan'an statue as Ten'yu within Korin'in's altar would have been incongruous ritually and institutionally. The change from Ten'yu to Jofu took place, moreover, independently from likeness: the statue shows no sign of having been physically altered even as it assumed a new name and identity. The appropriation and resignification of images and other cultural products, of course, is a common cross-cultural occurrence. Synchronically, it involves agents (human commu- nities and/or divine beings) acting on objects to confer new 23 Prerestoration altar room, abbot's quarters, Ryogen'in, Daitokuji (photo: courtesy of Ryogen'in and Kyoto Prefectural Board of Education) names, functions, and meanings that accord with contempo- rary social, ritual, and institutional requirements and local contexts of use. In making such conversions, communities were motivated largely by present need, though they were often conscious of the past and sometimes allowed prior identities to coexist with the new.126 In Japan, appropriation transpired in various areas of material, visual, and architec- tural culture. One thinks of the "found objects" put to new use as utensils in chanoyu (which later became heirlooms) and the collecting practice of giving tea utensils poetically reso- nant names (gomei) and inscribing these names, and those of successive owners, on storage boxes (hakogaki).127 Buddhist icons, such as the main image at the temple Muroji in Nara, were occasionally reidentified from one deity to another at particular moments by communities responding to changes in ritual and institutional necessity at the site of enshrine- ment.128 There are numerous cases of temple, shrine, and palace buildings that, relocated from their initial sites, were structurally reconfigured and ritually redefined for new owners.129 Various appropriations and reidentifications have occurred at Korin'in. In the mid-sixteenth century, recycled tombstones (boseki) and stone Buddha images (sekibutsu) were used to form the foundation for the abbot's quarters, a conversion prompted, I suspect, by the stones' hefty utility as well as their earlier, numinous identities.130 K6rin'in was even resignified in toto when it became Ryoshoji. Each synchronic alteration of an object or building's identity by a community is knotted into the diachronic weft of time. To assign a new identity implies one that preceded, whether known or not, including the change from unformed or inanimate material to representational or iconic object. Viewers at different times saw objects in different ways and layered their responses, uses, or abuses on those of earlier audiences. In some cases, the reidentification of icons re- sulted from temporal erasure and conditions of "nameless- ness" produced by fading memory, the absence of inscrip- tions and corroborating texts, and the lapse of rites that kept the name and identity alive.

An attractive alternative is to embrace the varied '~. .~' 'changes of identity experienced by images within successive communities and, sometimes, different settings. Seeing iden- , : tity as sequential and accumulative, without fixing the original identity or one assumed along the way, implies an interest in cultural biography and requires us to look again and again at objects over time.134 In this case, we may conclude that the K6rin'in statue's newfound identity as Jofu is as fundamen- tally correct at its present site as its earlier identity as Ten'yu was at its original site, Baigan'an.

They sought ways to</page><page sequence="20">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 91 convey sociopolitical status, cultural achievement, and spiri- tual charisma by augmenting, departing from, or relinquish- ing the transcription of physiognomic accuracy. Arguably, there are portraits that are likenesses and those that are not, but likeness often recedes into or melds with a more complex visual, ideological, and even magical and transhistorical body and self.137 One common trope in Japanese portraiture is the confla- tion of forms, and it appears in the painting of Vimalakirti (Yuima koji zu) by Bunsei (fl. 1460s) in the Yamato Bunkakan Museum (Fig. 24). The hanging scroll, which seems at the outset to be a straightforward depiction of the Indian exem- plar of lay Buddhist wisdom, Vimalakirti, is revealed in its inscription of 1457 to have been modeled after the warrior Arakawa Akiuji (fl. mid-fifteenth century) and to have served as the warrior's mortuary image.138 Which features belong to the tradition of imaginary depictions of Vimalakirti and which to the physiognomy of Akiuji is hard to tell, and perhaps irrelevant, since the overlay of sagacious imagery on theJapanese subject and the masking of the warrior's appear- ance with an authoritative visual type appear to have been done intentionally to imply the fusion of Akiuji's secular- warrior status with a devout, sagacious personality. In the famous portraits Ikkyu Sdjun as Xutang Zhiyu, also known as Ikkyu's "reincarnation portraits," theJapanese monk Ikkyu is depicted in the guise of his revered Dharma ancestor Xutang using physiognomy and figural form derived from a portrait of the Chinese patriarch (Fig. 25). Not simply copies of Xutang's portrait, the Ikkyu-as-Xutang images are made to shift back and forth between two subjects and between outer form and inner identity by Ikkyi's inscriptions, in which he asserts that the paintings in fact depict his (Ikkyu's) own features.139 This play is inverted in the portrait Ikkyu and Mori (Fig. 26). Though Ikkyi's familiar face appears within a calligraphic circle (enso) above the seated portrait of his lover Mori, the inscription subverts this expected identification by stating that the painting in the enso depicts the "true features of Xutang."140 Equally important in premodern portraiture inJapan is the role that costume attributes played as nonphysiognomic pointers to identity.141 A series of portraits of four generations of abbots in the Myoshinji lineage, for example, pictorializes a combination of richly patterned fabrics in their subjects' surplices that can be traced to an actual Ming Chinese surplice owned by the Myoshinji patriarch Giten Gensho (d. 1462).142 The use and maintenance of these patterns suggest the incorporation of a patriarchal relic into the seemingly conventionalized iconography of chinso to cloak unfolding generations of portraits and their subjects with a specific, though transhistorically shared, spiritual identity and authority. The tenuousness of likeness and the ideological nuances of representation are also suggested by the case of Myoshinji's founder Kanzan Egen (1277-1360), whose traditional biogra- phy recounts his antagonism (in the name of Emptiness) toward visual, textual, and material traces of himself serving as mediating objects of worship. Kanzan's apparent prohibi- tion against production of his portrait and the lack of a discourse record created a state of facelessness and wordless- ness resonant with his title Mus6 Daishi, "Great Teacher of No 25 Ikkyu Sojun as Xutang Zhiyu, autographic inscription dated 1468. Kyoto, Shinjuan, Daitokuji (photo: courtesy of Shinjuan and Kyoto National Museum) Aspect/Face." Nevertheless, painted and sculpted portraits of Kanzan were produced posthumously and played an impor- tant role in his descendants' efforts to revive Myoshinji during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.143 Sekko Soshin in particular compiled an official biography and commissioned several painted portraits that remade Kanzan into a readable and visible patriarchal figure.'44 No account of Kanzan's portraits is perhaps as intriguing as Mujaku Dochu's record in the Shobozanshi of the fabrication of the statue of Kanzan enshrined within Myoshinji's Mishoan Founder's Hall.145 Although the statue's face is powerfully naturalistic (aged, gaunt, it stares out at us with pronounced cheekbones, sunken eye sockets, and a drooping right eye-</page><page sequence="21">92 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 1 26 Ikkyu and Mori, 15th c. Osaka, Masaki Museum of Art (photo: courtesy of the Masaki Museum of Art) lid), Mujaku's account of the image suggests that these robustly modeled features were fortuitously acquired rather than physiognomically specific to the subject: Venerable Image of the Founder: [According to] the will of the National Teacher Kanzan, there were to be no portraits of him made. In the [time of the] fifth generation [patriarch of Myoshinji's lineage], Nippo [Soshun], how- ever, the question of making [the founder's] portrait was debated. The sixth generation [patriarch], Sekko [Soshin], followed Nippo's intention and had an image of a holy monk146 painted to serve as the portrait of the National Teacher Kanzan. The master Sekko's inscription is visible above this painted image of the founder. [But] when [it was decided to] carve the wooden image [of Kanzan] found in the Mishoan, there were no facial features to be relied on. Suddenly, however, an old woman appeared with an object wrapped in a cloth and inquired, would anyone buy a Buddha image? The monks took it, unwrapped the cloth, and inspected [its contents]. [Finding that] it was the head of a patriarch's image, the monks purchased it as a divine gift. They immediately used it for the head of the founder's image and had a body carved. Because of [these events], this image [of Kanzan] is austere and magnifi- cent.147 Sekko's painting [of Kanzan] does not resemble it. An inscription on the interior of the [statue's] skirt states: "eighth year of Daiei" [1528].148 While Mujaku's comment on the lack of similarity between the sculpted and painted portraits suggests some concern for the issue of resemblance, at least between portraits, the generic language of "a Buddha image/a patriarch's image" implies that a founder's statue might exist and operate without individuated likeness. The old woman, meanwhile, might be interpreted as a rhetorical device used to circumvent Kanzan's prohibitions by transferring agency to a liminal figure and to cast the portrait's creation as miraculous.149 This turn of events may have permitted the glorification of Kanzan's "pure" Zen and his responsibility to the doctrinal ideal of Emptiness while simultaneously facilitating the cre- ation of a needed visual object through which to commemo- rate and venerate Kanzan despite his aniconic rhetoric.150 Ritual Norms and Visual Forms Current research is gradually revealing additional chinso that have acquired new names and identities over time, and while not a common practice, it clearly occurred more frequently than might be expected.'15 That a portrait's identity could be altered and that its physiognomy might be circumstantial, in turn displacing likeness as the primary source of the portrait's identity or power, comes as little surprise to many Buddholo- gists. In doctrinal terms, the modern art historical fixation with realistic representation and likeness in chinso is inad- equate, if not beside the point, since the true self of the subject is fundamentally transcendent, formless, and beyond representation. This philosophical trope is played out in the vernacular terminology in which chinso (Sanskrit: usnisa; Chinese: dingxiang) and shin ("true"; Chinese: chen) were "used in the construction of puns that played on the impossibility of expressing the inexpressible."152 Like their Chinese andJapanese predecessors, Daitokuji abbots partici- pated in such heuristic wordplay and engaged in prickly critiques of representation. Their portrait inscriptions com- ment that however real the painted image might seem to viewers, it did not capture the abbot's true form or identity, which resided beyond visual form in the formless spirit:</page><page sequence="22">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 93 "Hah! A ball of radiant light! You can attempt to paint it but you'll never bring it off' (NanpoJomyo, 1288); "Just who is he? Who is the one painted there on the new silk?" (Shuho Myocho, 1334).153 This questioning of form and identity is also provoked in the reincarnation portraits of Ikkyu and in his portrait with Mori. The realness of chinso, therefore, operates in tension with "realistic" representation and must rely on other means, such as ritual investiture. It is here, in fact, that we find a mechanism for the Baigan'an portrait's reidentification. Rites of consecration transformed the creation and experience of most Buddhist icons, and the Baigan'an statue of Ten'yu was undoubtedly invested with the monk's spirit and had its eyes opened after its completion and installation at his temple. While there do not appear to be Zen liturgical codes or other texts that outline a procedure for ritual reidentification, the general protocol of consecration permits us to imagine a process conducted in two phases. Prior to the statue's move- ment from Baigan'an, Ten'yu Joko's eyes would have been closed and his spirit removed from the statue and invested in an alternate support, perhaps a spirit tablet whose fate today remains unclear. This would have rendered the statue safe for movement.154 On its arrival at K6rin'in, the image would have been reconsecrated with Jofu's spirit drawn out from a corresponding tablet or painted portrait. Whether or not these rites were held in secret by the abbots and monks of K6rin'in and Baigan'an or acknowledged openly to their temple communities is an interesting ques- tion, but in either case they underscore what Richard Vino- grad calls the "portrait as event," namely, that a portrait's becoming (or un-becoming) occurs through various mo- ments and encounters.155 Although it remains unclear if sale or some other form of exchange accompanied this ritual process, or if the statue resided in intermediary locations between Baigan'an and Korin'in, the events were motivated, I suspect, by disruption (Baigan'an's closure) and demand (Korin'in's need for a founder's statue). Perhaps some kind of negotiation transpired within Daitokuji when Baigan'an's abbot Soteki, retiring in 1872, faced the closure of his temple and sought to preserve its buildings, graves, founder's statue, other icons, and various treasures and documents. This ritual process of de/reconsecration would thus give the Baigan'an statue the power to transcend likeness and become Korin'in's founder. Indeed, K6rin'in's present abbot, responding to our unexpected discovery of the inscription, described this process as "removing one spirit and inserting another" (aru rei wo nuite, betsu no rei wo ireru). But despite its relative efficiency, this scenario still leaves me wondering about the portrait's visual presence. In the strict logic of consecration, chinso are functionally equivalent to a larger group of objects, including spirit tablets inscribed with the names of the deceased but lacking figura- tion, all of which can serve equally as empowered substitutes for the departed and as channels between immanence and transcendence.156 This implies that the statue's physiognomy and visual form are secondary or have no greater value than the nonfigured tablet, since the sitter's true identity is located not merely, or essentially, in the sculpted or painted face and its naturalism but, rather, in the formless spirit installed through consecration. Any image or object, Sharf has specu- lated, can become a person's "portrait" as long as it is properly invested, a view that suggests that likeness is dispens- able and that portrait identity and affective power are pre- scribed through ritual rather than expressive form.157 Scholars who elucidate this concept of equivalence neverthe- less acknowledge that representation and figuration play a role in the Mahayana dialectic of Emptiness.158 Foulk and Sharf comment that an abbot's "real form," being formless, cannot be captured in any sort of painting. A true representation or depiction of the master can only be no representation at all. And yet, in the words of the Heart Sutra, "emptiness is not other than form"-the true nature of the master should not be mistaken for his physical form, but nor can it be found apart from it. The very notion of a "non-representation" can only be signified through representation.159 But when they state that "... all [chinso], regardless of their aesthetic value or style, are of a type in respect to their religious significance: they all functioned as holy icons embody- ing the charisma of a ... Buddha,"160 I sense a certain reluctance to allow visuality into the equation. By emphasiz- ing ritual and ontology and almost dismissing visual form and its differentiation, they may sit down too heavily on one end of the "seesaw" dialectic of Emptiness, catapulting the process of vision and the affective power of images out of the balance. I am not sure that we should collapse the religious efficacy of chinso so far into consecration and the philosophical trope of form/emptiness. Did appearances really not matter (and if so, to whom and when)? And how much distance lay between doctrinal/ritual ideals and local practices of portrait produc- tion and devotion?161 Are the visual features of chinso merely a convenient convention and their expressive qualities solely of "art historical" concern? My intention here is neither to exaggerate nor adopt disciplinary boundaries (textual/Buddhological/anthropo- logical versus visual/art historical) but, rather, to ask how an argument might be made for the visual in chinso that avoids the aestheticizing gaze of early formalist art history, acknowl- edges consecration, cultic experience, and the dialectic of Emptiness, and still accommodates the power of visual form in their iconicity. My responses here are preliminary, but if emptiness and form go hand in hand to produce what Faure describes as the "paradoxical presence or visuality" of icons and what Malcolm David Eckel calls "the Buddha as a place where an absence is present," then the expressive treatments of physiognomy and the varied solutions of figuration in chinso, not to mention the foggy terrain of their reception, need to be studied intently.162 Perhaps we might begin by placing chinso more explicitly within the broader processes of vision and expression of form in the Mahayana devotional tradition, just as Buddhologists situate chinso within the larger magical and ritual tradition of empowered icons.163 We also need to decide to what extent and when chinso can be discussed independently from other traditions of Buddhist portraiture, especially those that de- ploy a high degree of naturalism.164 Once we acknowledge Chan/Zen adherence to mediation (one might even say the tradition's flagrant use of images), and if we accept that</page><page sequence="23">94 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 1 Buddhist images including chinso are not merely expedient doorways to higher understanding (that is, that the true bodies of the Buddha, bodhisattva, or patriarch are absent ontologically and nonrepresentational), then, perhaps, we may assess how chinso iconography and form (including lifelike modeling) programmed the images' own reception and how art participated in the ritual acts that empowered the images and brought them into the experience of particular communities.165 Icons, in this view, do not simply give a convenient place and form to the transcendent or serve as visually or rhetori- cally neutral holders of invisible spirit, and we may identify cases in which form itself turns toward and seeks to reveal the ultimate and invisible.166 The transcendent self that exists beneath/beyond representational form was something that the artist of the startling twelfth-century statue of the Chinese monk Baozhi (Japanese: Hoshi, ca. 418-514) at Saioji, Kyoto, attempted to show, it seems, through expressive means. The image presents the monk's face in a moment of supernatural corporeal transformation, splitting open to reveal the face of the numinous Eleven-headed Kannon pushing through the skin, a "paradoxical attempt to reveal the invisible."167 The statue of Ragora, meanwhile, one of eighteen arhats pro- duced for the Kyoto temple Manpukuji in 1663-64, depicts the figure holding open his abdomen to reveal the face of the Buddha (the Buddha nature) within.168 The carving and coloration of the cleaving face and gaping abdomen of these images, the vertical seams of the former and the hands pulling aside the viscera in the latter, may have been compel- ling for viewers in expressive, sculptural terms and may have provoked (through analogy to our own bodies and the suggestion of motion in immobile wood images) a level of response that resonated simultaneously with or indepen- dently (though not necessarily divergent) from the underly- ing doctrinal message.169 The particular forms of these two statues and their drama of physical transformation and animate motion empower the visual expression and reception of the paradox of the immanent and transcendent and express the inexpressible. Form made them compelling devotional, didactic objects-not merely famous "works of art." Such images call to mind David Freedberg's arguments for a certain "striving for verisimilitude." 170 The lifelike reproduc- tion of features and naturalism (independent from accurate realism) were insistently sought after in the modeling of many Buddhist icons and played a significant role in the evocation of divine presence. Various representational strategies were employed to exploit the sense of vision and visual experience while enhancing the potential for engaged response to icons: anthropomorphic features and proportions, rigorous anatomi- cal detail and subtle colorism, the use of real garments, the direction and quality of the icon's gaze, and so forth, all of which contributed to the "intimacy of affective relations between image and beholder."171 One chinso statue that partakes of such strategies is the portrait of Ikkyu at Shinjuan, which had real hair (said to be Ikkyu's) implanted in the face.172 In the eighteenth century, one diarist jotted down the following: "The subtemple Shin- juan, the abbot Ikkyu's burial site, enshrines a wood image of Ikkyu which has his real hair for its beard."173 When we read such laconic statements, we wonder what ran through the author's eyes and mind both at the moment of encounter and on later reflection. At what levels did his reactions reverber- ate: the sense of lifelike visual presence or animate proximity (it's him; it's alive); the distinctiveness and notoriety of the image (how strange, unusual for it to have real hair); the numinous power of relics and the blurring between corpses and portraits; and/or awareness of Ikkyu's enlightened, invisible transcendence? Any and all seem possible, of course, but it may be that the visible and visual features of such icons made them affectively and effectively quite full even while leading certain viewers to Emptiness. What we need to do, therefore, is explore the efficacy of specific chinso and their impact on viewers within particular temples, especially sites that incorporated devotional audi- ences with different degrees of religious attainment and varied motivation. Portraits within Daitokuji are often enumer- ated in guidebooks and diaries, but detailed responses to their forms and expressive qualities are few and far between. Those that do appear, such as Kiyokawa Hachiro's comments on the glittering eyes of the Soken'in portraits of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi quoted above, suggest local and personal levels of response to the affective powers of form active below or beside (but not necessarily in opposition to) ritual norms and philosophical discourse. We might also imagine the visual power exerted by chinso by noting that even statues in museums still fascinate many viewers not merely because of their historical and canonized values but because even in the gallery, albeit in the evocative spaces created by boutique lighting, the portraits seem as if they might suddenly speak, wield their meditation staffs, or rise and walk through the implied or actual barrier between the place of installation and the viewer's space.l74 Consider as well the strange feelings of discomfort and fascination that we may experience on seeing photographs of the Korin'in statue's detached head and headless body (Figs. 12, 13, 27, 28). Perhaps the gruesome allure of the portrait in this dismembered, disfigured state is the flip side of its intact, affective visual presence. At Daitokuji, moreover, we find abundant evidence of the value accorded figuration, which, while not contradicting the ritual norm, suggests an unmistakable attention to and even preference for the portrait presence of patriarchal subjects.175 The historical identity and spiritual authority of Daitokuji and its subtemples accrue principally and distinctly through the teachings and ritually renewed presences of their founding abbots, and great efforts were made to secure their presences through a variety of objects and events. Although a properly invested spirit tablet devoid of physiognomic representation (such as appears beside Jofu's portrait in Fig. 1) would be sufficient as a focal point for the recognition and renewal of presence, whenever possible the patriarch is evoked and mediated through a descriptive portrait enshrined centrally on an altar and surrounded by an architecture and adorn- ment of specific plan and character.176 To some extent, the statue is more visible and accessible than the patriarch's stupa, suggesting an important differentiation or play between these two presences. That Daitokuji's subtemples would undertake a mass conversion from painted to sculpted portraits of their founders suggests that figuration, as a central preoccupation,</page><page sequence="24">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 95 W 28 Portrait Statue of ShokeiJofu, detail of headless torso from rear 27 Portrait Statue of ShokeiJofu, detail of headless torso on altar was itself subject to an intensifying structure of values com- pelled by new concerns for the enhancement of patriarchal presence and authority through visual images.177 When patriarchal prohibitions against portraits are disre- garded in actual practice, it gives rise to productive tensions. I have already noted the production of Kanzan's portraits at Myoshinji.178 In Daitokuji's case, Takuan Soho forbade the posthumous display of his figural portrait and ordered that a calligraphic circle (enso), a potent symbol of the mind, be hung instead as his "true likeness."179 This substitution, however antifigurative it seems, needs to be situated within the Zen school's rhetorical and ideological stance toward images and considered alongside Takuan's activities as por- trait inscriber (of his own painted portraits and those of other abbots) and participant in rites of portrait consecration.180 Moreover, Takuan's rhetoric was diverted (converted) by his followers, who apparently were not satisfied with the enso serving as his final image and had a posthumous portrait statue carved and enshrined at Nanshiji. It is also important to dispel the impression given by some Buddhologists that chinso iconography and form are utterly conventionalized and prosaically repetitive and, thus, to explore the diversity of figural types as well as the visual, doctrinal, and social implications of representational selec- tion.181 The coding of visual form has already been alluded to in the case of portraits at Myoshinji, which, however generic their iconography appears, take on specific meaning through their pictorial replication of Giten Gensho's surplice. The seemingly endless repetition of figural forms in abbot portrait paintings at Daitokuji during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, meanwhile, reveals not an ossified artistic tradition but rather, I believe, the pictorial borrowing of patriarchal bodies through meaningful allusion to thirteenth- and four- teenth-century archetypal portraits of Daitokuji's ancestors Xutang, Nanpo, and the founder Myocho.182 There are also images, such as the "Red Sword" portraits of Ikkyi (Shutachi z6), discussed by Onishi Hiroshi, and what I have called the "Single-shoe" portraits of abbots in the Ryogen'in lineage, which break the mold in their novel features and variations of figural form.183 These acts of pictorial replication and depar- ture from normative formulas call for careful handling, but they suggest the value accorded both maintenance and differentiation within tradition and the use of specific forms to convey spiritual and institutional identity. To avoid the pitfalls of a simple equivalence of consecrated objects and the dismissal of form, on the one hand, and aestheticization, on the other, it therefore seems imperative to look for circulation or oscillation occurring among the different types of doubles of the abbot (portrait, mummy, stupa and remains, contact relics, spirit tablet, and so on) and among multiple agendas operating within and around the paradox of the Two Truths (the Heart Sutra's "Emptiness is not other than form; form is not other than emptiness"), including those that have need of particular visual forms.184 This may help us to grasp how and why particular communi- ties devoted great effort and resources to the production and I</page><page sequence="25">96 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 1 installation of portrait images of particular form (in some cases transgressing prohibitions and supplanting nonfigured objects) as a way to enhance the visual presence of patriarchal subjects. These figural representations still needed to be made "real" through eye openings and other ritual norms and would, in turn, embody the play between transcendent absence and invisibility on the one hand, and the palpable form and verisimilitude of immanent humanity on the other.185 Resemblance to Type and an Expected Presence When brought to bear on the Korin'in statue, the preceding discussion of likeness, ritual norms, and visual forms has a certain teleological risk to it, one driven by an assumption with which the reader has been made complicit-namely, knowledge of the statue's hidden inscription. Privileged by this discovery and its reverberations, I have sought explana- tions for the statue's flux of site and identity, addressing relocation and reidentification along the way. Therein lies a problem, since we cannot assume that all viewers were aware of or concerned with the now-recovered inscription. While the interior inscriptions and deposited items of many statues were known and valorized across time, other images have held their secrets fast for centuries.186 Thus, we must be wary of our retrospective vantage point and scholarly concerns. If pos- sible, we should return directly to Korin'in, to the statue's audiences and their responses: How did the statue behave in the life of the temple during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries? How did its audiences encounter and perceive the statue? Would the preceding scholarly narrative have mattered to them? A thorough anthropology of the K6rin'in statue and its communities may be impossible, but I assume that the portrait was encountered in different moments and manners by a mixed audience of religious professionals, lay adherents, tourists, and scholars. None, it would appear, made the statue's interior inscription or identity a subject of inquiry or debate. I would hazard, moreover, that, with the exception of those who orchestrated the appropriation of the Baigan'an statue and its reconsecration and to the extent that memory of these events lingered, most viewers brought before the statue from Meiji onward would have had little reason to doubt its identity or to question its lifelike authority. The sleight of hand (or face) performed here would have been easily concealed: By the late nineteenth century no one could know how Baigan'an or Korin'in's founding abbots actually looked. Short of arranging the type of comparison between the statue and life-period paintings of Jofu and Ten'yu conducted above or having access to the hidden inscription, nothing about the statue would seem unusual or incongruous; there would have been no need for the temple to suppress knowledge of what had transpired.187 Installed within the Korin'in abbot's quarters, could the portrait be anyone other than Shokei Jofu? Could its facial features be those of someone else? Although it is unclear why Korin'in did not effect a change from its founder's painting to a statue until the late nine- teenth century, the turmoil of the Meiji era and the suddenly homeless Baigan'an statue may have provided K6rin'in a belated opportunity to fulfill the iconic and devotional objective of enhanced veneration of its founding abbot.188 This scenario might imply that for Korin'in a recycled statue invested with a new identity was better than no statue at all, and that the urge to venerate superseded the requirement of likeness. The logic of consecration, meanwhile, provided an acceptable means to rationalize and to explain (away) this peculiar event. If physiognomic likeness were a crucial requirement, one might argue that it would have been possible to physically rework the statue and achieve a match of form and identity. Because of the conventional method of sculpting detachable heads for portrait statues, Korin'in might have commissioned a new head depicting Jofu based on the temple's painted portrait and then fitted it to the borrowed body. Such a solution would have imposed some financial burden, but the body's conventional pose, costume, and regalia would have accommodated this new head-although there might then have arisen the problem of what to do with the displaced head.189 That no such adjustment was carried out might suggest that the statue so thoroughly met expectations of what a portrait of K6rin'in's founding abbot should look like at the time that there was no sense of disjuncture and no need to remove or alter its existing form. Presumably it had all the right traits and played the part in the same way that the head fortuitously acquired from the old woman became Kanzan's head on the Myoshinji founder's statue. Perhaps the same reason posited byYonekura for the obdurateness of the long-standing identi- fication of the Jingoji portrait as Minamoto Yoritomo applies here-that it is based not so much on historical or physiog- nomic grounds as on the fact that the representation (of whomever it really is) fits expectations of how the desired subject should look. Specific likeness may have been relinquished, therefore, but it was no doubt imperative that the statue fulfill certain visual obligations. Within the altar at Korin'in, the acquired statue would have to convey the proper sense of patriarchal presence. Not any statue would do; a portrait from a different tradition of Buddhist portraiture might well have been seen as incongruous and provoked questions regarding the image's name, identity, and presence in Korin'in. The effectiveness of the statue was thus dependent in part on the visual suitability of its iconography and the quality of its form.190 An acceptable exchange was presumably possible between the acquired image and its new community: the statue provided the appropriate aura ofJofu and, in turn, received veneration and recognition ofJofu's historical identity and spiritual charisma. We might thus see the statue at Korin'in as resembling a "founding abbot" and attaining "likeness to type" rather than traditional portrait verisimilitude. But it bears reitera- tion that to viewers lacking knowledge of the inscription and access to painted portraits, the statue no doubt had immedi- ate authenticity, which, aided by the quality of figural lifelike- ness, provoked the sense of Jofu's presence. It is the percep- tion of similitude (however mistaken) rather than its a priori accuracy that matters here.191 The Siting and Ritual Reiteration of Identity Reception of the image as Jofu was no doubt conditioned by various local factors and expectations. Korin'in's abbot and other speakers for the temple certainly had the power to</page><page sequence="26">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 97 assert the statue's identity and to "convince the faithful of the truth of the claims made of the image."192 But the consecra- tion of the icon and its efficacy were powerfully associated, I believe, with the place of enshrinement. The statue's institu- tional, architectural, and ritual context would have contrib- uted greatly to perception of the image's identity: where the statue was installed and encountered played a significant role in determining who it was.193 The enduring relationships among religious sites, their founders, numinous images, and communities of the faithful have been given rich textual and visual manifestation inJapan in the tradition of "miraculous origins" (engi; Sanskrit: pratitya samutpada, or "codependent origination") literature and illustration (engie). Throughout the premodern era, these representations expressed the interconnectedness of temples and icons as simultaneously magical and historical as well as visionary and artistic/material, while the biographies of images, sites, and founders often merged to become insepa- rable. Nothing akin to the great tales of late Heian- and Kamakura-period temples and their icons exists for Korin'in, but the connections between Daitokuji's subtemples and their founders' portraits were exceedingly tight.l94 The cultic setting at K6rin'in inscribes on the founder's statue a singular identity. We might begin with the temple as a whole, for Korin'in's precinct occupies space in a particular monastic geography. The Daisen'in and Ryogen'in branches of Daitokuji's lineage have come to be known respectively as the Southern and Northern lineages (Minami-ha and Kita- ha). This nomenclature originated from the locations of the subtemples established by or for the patriarch of each lineage: Ryogen'in, established for Tokei Soboku in about 1517 and built in the southern part of Daitokuji; Daisen'in, established by Kogaku Soko in 1513 and located in the north. As Soko and Soboku's descendants founded their own subtemples, Daisen'in and Ryogen'in emerged as head subtemples (hon'an) of two lineages of sites and the nuclei of two subtemple zones within the monastery: Northern lineage sites, including Baigan'an, clustered around Daisen'in and spread westward; Southern lineage sites, such as Korin'in, arose around Ryogen'in and dominated the south. Lineage was therefore mapped across the monastery, and the very position ofJofu's temple K6rin'in encoded it and its founder's image with "geo-Dharmic" identity. Within Korin'in, meanwhile, Jofu's presence is established by his stupa and the abbot's quarters, as well as portraits and other visual and material traces. These remains define a holy place and give it a holy name that is localized in the abbot's quarters' altar room. In plan and design, the altar is heir to an evolving tradition of patriarch halls (shodo, soshido) that accorded an axial position to the founder's portrait, an area called the shinzen, literally, "before the (abbot's) portrait," flanked by spaces for portraits and spirit tablets of later abbots to the east and a chapel (shido) for lay mortuary figures to the west.195 This tripartite configuration was amplified consider- ably in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries at Daitokuji in tandem with the installation of founder statuary. The portrait of the founder came to reside at this time within a magnificent, recessed niche framed with brocade curtains, folding doors, a plaque with calligraphy of the founder's title or "studio name" (shitsugo), and a set of stairs with carved balustrades (Fig. 23).196 This type of elevated, hierarchic, and ornamented space not only focused attention visually on the founder's image, it also selected a status and identity that fit the site, was reiterated by the name on the plaque, and was congruent with the image's typological features and expres- sive form.197 Ritual viewing and veneration of the portrait took place in the chapel to the south of the altar room (Figs. 7, 8). Focused on the altar, the chapel was a space that structured encounter and response, its plan and decoration translating to and from the ritual protocol and iconic object of memorial commemo- ration. That the place of portrait worship could be a setting of elaborate political pageantry as well as personal emotive and spiritual experience is suggested by records in the Onryoken nichiroku and other diaries of visits made by members of the Ashikaga family to mortuary temples such as Tojiin and the subtemples of Shokokuji. That it might be a setting of untoward events is revealed in the Chronicle of Daito (Daito Kokushi nenpu), which recounts how the abbot of Ryosh6ji died of facial burns suffered when he was hit by a falling oil lamp while worshiping before the temple's statue of Nanpo Jomyo.198 It was, I believe, a space of this world and beyond, and one entered not without a certain yearning and awe. The identity of the founder's image at Korin'in was created, therefore, not by pure likeness or merely by the act of ritually switching spirits but also by the setting of enshrinement. Following the statue's reconsecration at Korin'in, and em- braced within its prescriptive iconic space, the portrait's acquired identity would have been affirmed and anchored through ritual practices that have a long history in the Chan/Zen school: the arrangement of altar decorations (shogon); daily offerings placed before the image and its upkeep by the temple's "portrait officer" (jishin); the protocol of visitation and mortuary donations made to the portrait image (miei kuyo); and the observance of annual memorial rites.199 No rite was more significant that the founder's memorial, which followed the Buddhist mortuary calendar and proce- dures outlined in monastic codes. In their full performance, they were multiact events, led by a senior monk (doshi) with the participation of the monastic and lay community, which centered around three moments of ritualized encounter with the portrait/abbot (shukuki, kenshuku, and hansai). All incorpo- rated acts of adornment, the chanting of scripture (fugin) accompanied by ritual music, prostrations and lighting of incense (shoko raihai), offerings of tea and hot water (tencha, tento), and the recitation of mortuary verses (nenko) and dedications of merit (eko).200 These rites presented, it seems, two reciprocal senses-two faces-of the patriarch: as an immanent, physical presence of institutional and spiritual authority and charismatic sayings and doings and as a transcendent absence, his enlightened nature beyond form and representation. The placement of the subject's robes and bowl beside the lifelike portrait, offerings of food, as well as the performance of prostrations before the portrait all promoted reception of the image as a proximate, living, and enlightened subject whose charisma/ teaching was and is active in this world and accessible to the religious community.201 Individuated presence was enhanced through the display of calligraphy scrolls along the wall that</page><page sequence="27">98 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 1 demarks the boundary between the chapel (the location of the initiating monk and worshiping community) and the altar (the portrait's space). The founder's death verse (yuige) was hung on axis with the statue, while his enlightenment verse, calligraphies conferring religious names from teachers, and/or imperially conferred titles appeared on either side.202 These relics identified (and visually framed) the portrait subject; they communicated his enlightenment and acquisition of monastic authority while, through their intertextuality, assimi- lating him into the transhistorical and ideological community of teachers and patriarchs. The nenko and eko texts read during the memorial reiterated the name and rank of the mortuary subject, and it is likely that memorial encounters were also framed by narration of the patriarch's biography (gyjo) .203 Recitations of the central events ofJofu's training as a monk, his momentous awakening, and his illustrious career (embodied in the hanging scrolls and in the portrait's sacerdotal costume and posture) would have incited percep- tion of his identity and reflection on his achievements and lingering charisma. Simultaneous to these identifying, and often impressive, representations were recitations of Buddhist texts that oscillated beyond the earthly presence, spirituality, and institutional authority of the abbot to evoke the pervasive powers of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, which could provide worldly benefits and aid spiritual awakening leading, ulti- mately, to Emptiness. Memorials were events for the living that forged contact with the absent dead, who were made palpably present. They promoted various messages and levels of experience: pag- eantry and aesthetic splendor, personal remembrance, charis- matic presence and transcendent magic, as well as institu- tional prestige and authority. Specific participants no doubt negotiated differently the play between the portrait as earthly living presence and paradoxical form of formlessness. To what extent the ideal of Emptiness was valued above devo- tional experience may have varied considerably. Nevertheless, the identity of the visualized, ritualized patriarchal presence at hand was, I believe, inescapable (no matter where it might lead the viewer visually, spiritually, and philosophically or how mistaken his or her perception of likeness). In this cultic environment, and not simply because of the statue's reconse- cration or the presence or absence of actual likeness, who else could the portrait be but K6rin'in's founder, Jofu? Looking Back, Looking Ahead There are any number of frames through which one might study the Korin'in founder's statue: iconography and sculp- tural form, "likeness" and its relationship to interior or "true" self, ritual/anthropological experience and meaning, documentary and biographical traces, and so forth. Some frames open up narrative, while others close it down. The judgments of early formalist art history, for example, might lead us to dismiss the Korin'in statue as artistically secondary to earlier, more robustly naturalistic images or those with distinguishing features. If our definition of what constitutes a "true portrait" is dependent primarily on individuated like- ness, we might conclude, albeit exaggeratedly so, that the statue at Korin'in is no longer a "portrait" because its physiognomy and identity have come unbound over time.204 While the logic of consecration and the concept of ritual equivalence may allow us to disengage from such definitions and explain the Baigan'an statue's transformation from Ten'yu into Jofu independently from form, they may also leave us wondering, "why bother with figuration at all?"205 and divert us from grappling with the portrait's visual pres- ence and the expectations directed at it. I have found it useful to construct an omnivorous narrative to enable us, first, to admit the Korin'in image into scholarly discourse, and then to explore, however precariously, the formation and reception of portrait identity, ritual and doctrinal values, and the visual in chinso. If I have been reluctant to propose a single definition of what makes a portrait a portrait or to fix identity to a single form, act, or response, it is because I have found that the apparent disjunctures and incongruousness surrounding the Korin'in statue (its switch from site to site and person to person, its absence from scholarly discourse, and so forth) invite- indeed, require-us to consider an approach that acknowl- edges contingent and contextualized viewing and experience. Thus, I have suggested that the statue's identity might be established in not one but several ways (through representa- tion, ritual, and context), and that particular identities were sought by changing audiences at different moments (by an initial community at Baigan'an, by another at Korin'in, and then by different modern/postmodern schol- arly constituencies). Admittedly, the statue's reception at Korin'in in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries remains opaque, and we may never ascertain just how its audiences faced the portrait at this time and experienced its presence (or ab- sence). As a later viewer, I have myself engaged in reidentifica- tion and appropriation by locating the statue's hidden inscrip- tion, by tracking down Baigan'an and its founder, by challenging canonization and querying likeness and recep- tion, and by inserting the statue into an argument for the accumulating identity of icons and the visual power of chinso.206 If this leads us to continue reappraising the assumed narratives for chinso and other images, then it may, I hope, prove justified. Although the discovery of an inscription is an exciting moment, in which we face traces of a past that we are in the midst of (re)creating, the partial recovery of the Korin'in statue's dedicatory text did not provide further validation of a singular iconic identity and power.207 Instead, it presented something of a predicament for the temple and myself: historically (what happened and how), technically (how to read the inscription fully without further invasion of the image and disruption of its community), interpretatively (what does it imply about chinso and portraiture), and anthropologically (what are the ritual, spiritual, and social implications). Although some degree of resolution has emerged, and Korin'in's abbot has graciously granted me permission to reproduce what are in his eyes unsettling photographs, the temple's desire to protect the statue's identity as Jofu and, hence, its devotional environment was brought into (and arguably remains in) tension with empiri- cal study and the academy. It is likely, moreover, that the portrait's story will take additional twists and turns in the future, and we might thus see the Baigan'an statue's arrival at</page><page sequence="28">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 99 Korin'in and its reconsecration as Jofu as a moment of equilibrium. Unlike its original site of enshrinement, the Baigan'an statue of Ten'yu emerged unscathed from the Meiji persecu- tion of Buddhism. While the image's autochthonic bonds were cut, the portrait returned to iconic status and was resituated in an environment of ritual, devotion, and Dharma ideology. Thus, it escaped diversion into the art market and did not face the commodifications and institutionalization in museums that other chinso experienced. And, while it lost one identity and aura, it found another. But appropriation and reidentification are an open-ended business, and an object once moved and resignified could, in the hands of a different audience and in the face of new circumstances, be removed and remade yet again. In the not so distant future, for example, the threat of air pollution and the financial burdens of in situ preservation of Daitokuji's many icons, calligraphies, documents, and decora- tive objects may force the monastery to construct a commu- nal, climate-controlled "treasure hall" (homotsukan).208 While the removal of objects into such a facility would not result in the full decontextualization suffered in the public museum and, by virtue of the treasure hall's location within the monastery, would sustain certain religious and ideological interests, it would slip many temple icons and objects out of their native spaces and dispensations and alter their display and experience. A more provocative, though less likely, scenario also comes to mind. It is not entirely impossible that Ten'yu's Dharma descendants or the descendants of Baigan'an's lay patrons might in the future wish to revive the temple.209 Were this to transpire, and if they were informed of the K6rin'in statue's inscription, one could imagine that they might lay claim to the image and pursue its repatriation. If such an endeavor were successful, no doubt the statue's new owners would seek to return its original identity through another episode of relocation and reconsecration. Perhaps there is still reason to wonder, therefore, where the statue will go next and who it will be.

Ryoshoji was established initially in western Kyoto as a mausoleum for the monk NanpoJomyo (d. 1308), the teacher of Daitokuji's founder Myocho, and was relocated to Daitokuji in 1539. See Takenuki, 1993; Kawakami, 217-27. 22. In sketching the temple's history, one might also note that during the Edo and Meiji periods and through the first decades of the twentieth century, the position of abbot at Korin'in was filled according to a system of rotating, short-term appointments (rinban jujisei); Takenuki, 1993, 383. Since 1932, however, there have been four permanent abbots, including Fukushiro Yodo, appointed in 1986. 23. The building, designated an Important Cultural Property in 1962, is preceded in date by abbot's quarters at the Daitokuji subtemples Daisen'in (1513), Ryogen'in (ca. 1517), and Zuihoin (ca. 1552-57). The oldest abbot's quarters (ca. 1387) is at Ryugin'an, a subtemple of Tofukuji. See Kawakami, Levine; and official repair reports (Shuni koji hokokusho) prepared by the prefectural government for individual sites. 24. Two Daitokuji gazetteers, the Hozan shish6 (1720) and Murasakino Daitokuji meisaiki (1811), identify Kohogen (Kano Motonobu) as the artist of Korin'in's paintings; Suntory Bijutsukan, ed., Suntory Bijutsukan 20 shunen kinen ronshu (Tokyo: Suntory Bijutsukan, 1982), 142-50. 25.

Travel journals of the 17th to late 19th centuries written by Japanese and foreign visitors also reveal popular fascination with Daitokuji's sub- temples, icons, graves, gardens, and teahouses. See Koma. 27. Kyotofu, 1978a, 39. 28. Eulogies composed by the monks Daiko Sogen and Esso Myoi in 1852 for the 300th anniversary of Jofu's death, and no doubt read before the portrait, appear in Maruoka, vol. 3, nos. 318, 326. 29. Nishikawa, 93. 30. My access to Jofu's statue was aided, perhaps, by the opacity of my identity: neither tourist, adherent, American studying meditation, nor mem- ber of theJapanese scholarly or museum establishment. 31. Rumor has it that art historians who requested permission to view Daitokuji's famous triptych of Guanyin, Crane, and Gibbons by the 13th-century Chinese painter Muqi were sometimes sent postcards reproducing the paintings, the monastery effectively saying "Here it is, this is your viewing." 32. I have been predisposed to such responses, no doubt, by the writings of Bernard Faure, David Freedberg, and others. 33. The survey's records are kept by Kyoto Prefecture. See Hayashiya Tatsusaburo, "'Jiho chosa' no koro," Gakuso4 (Mar., 1982): 166-69. 34. Kyotofu, 1978b, 322. 35. Kyotofu, 1978a, nos. 17,18, 23. 36. See Faure, 1991 and 1996. 37. See Brinker and Kanazawa; Nedachi; and Nishikawa. Several later portraits appear in Kobayashi Takeshi, Shozo chokoku (Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kobunkan, 1969). An exception is the study of Obaku school portraits. See Elizabeth Horton Sharf, "Obaku Zen Portrait Painting: A Revisionist Analy- sis," Ph.D. diss., University of Michigan, 1994. Virtually ignored is the transformation of chinso with the development of photography. See Maruoka, vol. 3, 366, 370, 371. 38. The term is from Faure, 1998. Being left outside the canon is arguably advantageous to an image's iconicity. 39. Reproduced in Maruoka, vols. 1-3. 40. The scale of portrait production at Daitokuji can be gauged from Maruoka, "Collected Calligraphies of Daitokuji" (Daitokuji bokuseki zenshu, 1984-86), which reproduces more than two hundred portraits. Dozens more remain hidden in subtemple storehouses and appear briefly during memorial rites and airings. If we add literary evidence of images no longer extant, the number of chinso produced by Daitokuji's community becomes immense. 41. The most recent statue is a portrait of Kokei Sochin (1532-1597) at Soken'in, sculpted in 1997. 42. For the opening of an icon's eyes, see Davis, chap. 1; Faure, 1996, 249-55; Richard Gombrich, "The Consecration of a Buddhist Image," Journal of Asian Studies 26 (Nov. 1966): 23-36; and Freedberg, chap. 5.

The Reiun'in portrait of Daikyu Sokyu was made for the sitter's 150th memorial. 47. Ten'yu's inscription is transcribed in Nanshuji, Nanshuji shi (Sakai: Nanshuji, 1927), 149-50. 48. The significance of the head is also underscored by stories recounting how monks rescued the heads of important statues from burning buildings. One story regarding Daitokuji's statue of Myocho relates that when threatened by fire its head was saved by being thrown into a well. The head of the portrait statue of Myoshinji's founder, Kanzan Egen (1277-1360), was rescued from the burning monastery during the Onin War and moved to the temple Ryutanji; Mujaku Dochu (as in n. 44), 124. Theft of the head of Huineng's mummy is discussed in Faure, 1991, 163-64; and Sharf (as in n. 5). Two portrait statues that have original headsjoined to later replacement bodies are those of Emperor Go-Enyu (d. 1393) and Emperor Go-kogon (d. 1374) at Unryuin, Sennyuji (Kyotofu, 1978b, 184, 206). The Record of Tokoku relates that KeizanJokin's (1268-1325) mother fortuitously found the head of a statue of Kannon and had a body carved for it; Faure, 1996, 240-41. 49. Foulk and Sharf comment (200): "... the master's written inscription [on a painted portrait] would have established an effective connection between the abbot's image and his sacred presence, enlivening the portrait just as relics were used to enliven sculptural effigies of Buddhist saints." For inscription as a type of eye opening, see Faure, 1996, 259. 50. The head sat loosely in the opening of the torso supported on a wooden pole, one end covered with paper padding and inserted into the cranial cavity and the other resting on the bottom of the hollow torso. 51. I thank Mimi Hall Yiengpruksawan for her observations on such accommodations. 52. Although the subject's full name, that of the patron, and the dates of donation and inscription remain hidden, the text follows the conventional order noted above. 53. Zen monks are commonly referred to by the second of their two names (imina), but I refer to Ten'yuJoko as Ten'yu to avoid confusion with Korin'in's founder, Jofu. For Ten'yu's biography and Baigan'an's history, see Hirano (as in n. 1), 39-40, 165-66; and Yamada and Ito, 440-46, 460. Calligraphies by Ten'yu are reproduced in Maruoka, vol. 3, nos. 180-86. 54. For Daitokuji's sublineages, see Takenuki, 1993, 332-91. 55. The 1702 map is reproduced in Tayama, 175. A copy of the printed map is preserved in the Kyoto Prefectural Library and Archive. 56. See Hozan shisho and Murasakino Daitokuji meisaiki (as in n. 24). 57. Hirano (as in n. 1), 176, 180. 58. Comparison of these works may support the attribution of the Korin'in statue to Tanehisa, who is thought to have been a sculptor of the In school. It is possible that the hidden portion of the statue's inscription includes the sculptor's name. See Kyotofu 1978b; Tanaka Saburosuke, "Nanbokucho, Muromachi ki no shozo chokoku," in International Symposium on Art Historical Studies 6: Portraiture (Kyoto: Kokusai Koryu Bijutsushi Kenkyukai, 1987), 42. 59.

Comparing likenesses among portraits of a single individual may not be merely an art historical ploy. The Onryoken nichiroku temple diary (see the entry for 1462/9/18 [1462, 9th month, 18th day]) refers to Ashikaga Yoshimasa gathering multiple portraits of his father, Yoshinori. 62. See G.

Records of acquisition and collection appear in the Yamanoue Soji ki (1588-90). See Gotoh Bijutsukan, ed., Yamanoue Soji ki: Tensho juyonnen no manako (Tokyo: Gotoh Bijutsukan, 1995). Tea utensil collecting was itself stimulated in the 16th century by dispersal of the Ashikaga shogunal</page><page sequence="30">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 101 collection of art, which had been amassed from continental and domestic sources (see Guth). 65. Karen Brock, "The Shogun's 'Painting Match,' " Monumenta Nipponica 50, no. 4 (1995): 474-76. Sadafusa discovered three 12th-century scrolls, including Pictures of the Tale of the Ban Major Counselor (Bandainagon-e) now in the Idemitsu Art Museum, at a provincial shrine outside the capital. The scrolls had been produced for Emperor Go-Shirakawa (1127-1192) and deposited at his imperial treasury at the Kyoto temple Rengeoin. 66. Another source of dispersed Toyotomi architecture was Hideyoshi's Jurakutei palace (completed 1587), from which Daitokuji inherited a gate and various architectural pieces. Andrew Watsky's current research examines evidence for the relocation of Momoyama-period structures found in the Gien jugo nikki, diary of the Daigoji abbot Gien (1558-1626), and other sources. Mimi Hall Yiengpruksawan has reminded me of the conversion of residential palace structures into Buddhist halls, a practice that began at least during the Heian period. 67. See Guth, 101-2. 68. Sherry Fowler, "Hibutsu: Secret Buddhist Images of Japan," Journal of Asian Culture 15 (1991-92): 137-59. Sanctioned and ritualized movement is exemplified by degaicho, the temporary detaching of images from sites and their voyage on regional or national tours for popular worship and revenue collection. See McCallum (as in n. 2), 169-73. Ritually orchestrated transfer (senza) also occurred when new facilities for an icon were completed. 69. The rhapsodic comments found in the diaries of many European and American visitors toJapan during the late 19th and early 20th centuries reveal their romance with antiquity even as they were buying images and disrupting iconic settings. 70. A classic "Guest Buddha" is the statue of Sakyamuni at the Daitokuji subtemple Ryogen'in (established in 1517), which contains an inscription dating its production to 1250, evidence of a prior era of fabrication and site(s) of enshrinement. 71. See Guth's discussion of Masuda Takashi's acquisition and display of fragments of religious writings in the late 19th century (117-20). I thankYukio Lippit for alerting me to tekagami. 72.

To rule was not only to build monuments and commission treasures but also to seize and possess those of the past. Daitokuji acquired a broad range of objects as a direct or indirect result of Hideyoshi's campaigns in Korea. For speculation on the circulation of a Korean Buddhist painting, see Jon Carter Covell, "A 'Vendetta' over a Koryo-Period 'Willow Kuanyin,' " KoreaJournal 19, no.1 (1979): 36-45. 76. An account of the paintings' peripatetic history is found in the Miyako rinsen meisho zue (1799), in Shinshu Kyoto sosho Kankokai (as in n. 26), vol. 9, 44. Six of the paintings were lost during the 17th century and replaced with copies by Kano Tokuo. See Wen Fong, "Five Hundred Lohans at the Daitokuji," Ph.D. diss., Princeton University, 1956. The Lohan paintings remaining after the sale were secured at Daitokuji only in 1908, when they were designated National Treasures. 77. The portraits, donated in 1590 by the tea man Sen no Rikyu acting on Hideyoshi's behalf, were originally treasures of Kenchoji that had been removed by Hideyoshi as trophies following his campaigns in eastern Japan. See Yamada and Ito, 318. 78. Tayama, 375. 79. A 1541 directive issued at the monastery Tofukuji permitted the sale of dilapidated founder's halls. See Kawakami, 74. 80.

The donation is referred to in celebratory verses for the completion of Shinjuan (see Maruoka, vol. 2, no. 18). This episode reveals the transformation of a "personalized" portrait, granted from teacher to disciple, into a more "public" icon installed at a mortuary site. The portrait is identified as Shinjuan's main icon in an inventory dated 1520. See Suntory Bijutsukan, Daitokuji Shinjuan meihoten: Ikkyu zenji 500 nenki (Tokyo: Suntory Bijutsukan, 1980), 107. 87. In 1552 a portrait of Tentaku Sokyu was donated by a disciple to the Daitokuji subtemple Shogen'in, a site founded by Tentaku's own teacher Shunpo Soki (Yamada and Ito, 261-62). 88. Takenuki, 1993,101-19. 89. "Daitokujishu rensho shojo," in Shinjuan, Daitokuji, cited in Takenuki, 1993, 113. Ryoshoji's main icon of Shaka, meanwhile, was eventually installed in Daitokuji's Sanmon Gate in 1589. The role of portraits in ideological claims is also suggested by a document of 1553 in which followers of Ikkyu petitioned Daitokuji for permission to dismantle the mortuary site Shinjuan and move its portrait of Ikkyu to the temple Shuon'an; Yamada and Ito, 263. 90. Conspicuous movement of icons also occurred during the period following World War II.

The first of two jochi orders, promulgated on 1871/1/5 (1871, 1st month, 5th day), removed and disposed of, through sale or grant, lands exterior to temple and shrine precincts but excluded their precincts proper, surrounding fields, forests, and vacant land. Daitokuji and its subtemples had received large grants of exterior landholdings from its warrior patrons, and the first law had a devastating impact. The second law (1875/6/29) ordered confiscation of all lands except the actual grounds on which temple and shrine buildings sat.

A portrait of Retired Emperor Sutoku (1119-1164) was removed from Shiraminedera in Gifu and relocated to Kyoto, where it was installed in a newly established shrine, Shiramine Jingu. Discussed in Miyajima, Shozoga (Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kobunkan, 1994), 34-35.

Yoshimizu (as in n. 93), 73-74. 98. Subtemples were often the first to close, since their incomes came principally from lands granted by daimyo houses, which were quickly confis- cated by the government. See Nakatani, 49; Takenuki, 1992, 275-82. The monastery Shokokuji had 43,000 tsubo (approximately 35 acres) confiscated and shrank from forty to sixteen subtemples. Kenninji lost 30,000 tsubo (approximately 25 acres) and went from 53 to 15 subtemples. See Senri Bunka Zaidan (as in n. 95), 236. 99. See Rosenfield (as in n. 91), 243 n. 8. 100. Closures and mergers were particularly numerous between 1870 and 1875. Even with the voluminous archive of Kyoto Prefectural Documents it is still difficult to determine the specific events associated with individual temple closings. See Nakatani, 13, 43-53. 101. The western area of the monastery was of comparatively recent development. See Kawakami, 1968a, 127-265; and Takenuki, 1992, 287. References to these sites abound in Edo documents, including: Daitokuji shotatchu chigyo mokuroku (1615) (as in n. 19), Ryuhozan Daitokuzenji shi (1708) (in Yamada and Ito, 425-38), Hozan shisho (1720) (as in n. 24), Miyako rinsen meisho zue (1799) (as in n. 26), and Ryuhozan Daitokuzenji seifu (1854) (in Hirano [as in n. 1]). 102.

Some temples apparently put up treasures as collateral for bank loans. See Senri Bunka Zaidan (as in n. 95), 236. In the 1880s and 1890s, Daitokuji's surviving subtemples loaned treasures to the new Kyoto Imperial Museum.

The document later adds that Ryoshoji was to continue Korin'in's original mortuary functions; Kyotofu, 1978a, 47. 105. Recorded in the Hozan shisho and Murasakino Daitokuji meisaiki (as in n. 24), the paintings are absent from the 1854 gazetteer, Ryuho tekisatsu. 106. Paintings depicting Tatars Hunting, believed to be from Korin'in's abbot's quarters, have been identified in the Fenollosa-Weld Collection at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and at the Seikado Bunko Art Museum, Tokyo.

I have recently learned that Sangen'in's altar room enshrines three chinso statues: in the center, a portrait of the founder Shun'oku Soen (1529-1611); to the east, a portrait of Soen's disciple Gyokushitsu Sohaku (1572-1641), thought to have been relocated from the haijiDaigen'an; and on the west, an unidentified portrait that came from another closed site. Although these statues remain to be studied, all, no doubt, depict abbots of the same lineage. 123. Prior to the early 17th century, subtemple inventories from Daitokuji refer uniformly to abbot paintings rather than statuary. Subtemples estab- lished from the Kan'ei onward had portrait statues from the start. See Levine, 334-60; Kawakami; and Ota Hirotaro, ed., Nihon kenchikushi kiso shiryo shusei 16: Shoin, vol. 1 (Tokyo: Chuo Koron Bijutsu Shuppan, 1971), 32-37. 124. The 1674 inventory of Jukoin lists a painting of its founder, Shorei Sokin, that was placed in storage after its role was assumed by a statue. See Levine, 325-26. Ten'yu's inscription on the statue of Takuan at Nanshuji similarly notes that the master's enso image, which had served as his portrait, was placed in the temple storehouse after the statue's enshrinement. 125. This shift and its motivations await further investigation. 126. In Buddhist settings, concern also lay with the ensuing and future mortuary functions of consecrated icons. 127. See Ichio Yagi, "Uta-mei: The Poetic Names of Tea Utensils," Chanoyu Quarterly 83 (1996): 16-40; and Louise Allison Cort, Shigaraki: Potter's Valley (Tokyo: Kodansha International, 1979), 130-32. 128. The Muroji image, originally the Buddha Yakushi, was reidentified as Sakyamuni sometime in the 18th or 19th century "in order to match the identity of the (Muroji sculpture) group to the honji-butsu of Kasuga [Shrine]." See Sherry Fowler, "Muroji: A Contextual Analysis of the Temple and Its Images," Ph.D. diss., University of California, Los Angeles, 1994, 123-32. There are no doubt cases in which icons/deities were recorded as having changed identities themselves. 129.

The inscription by Zonko Somoku reads in part, "Zensai Shuso ... enshrined in the abbot's quarters chapel a painting of Vimalakirti that was modeled after his father's appearance.

Kanzan's antiportrait stance is referred to in Soshin's inscription on a portrait of Kanzan dated 1470 (preserved at Myoshinji) and discussed in</page><page sequence="32">THE FOUNDER'S STATUE AT THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE KORIN'IN 103 Mujaku Dochu (as in n. 44). For Kanzan's portraits, see OgisuJundo, "Kanzan Egen Zenji no chinso ni tsuite," Zengaku kenkyu 45 (1955): 14-26. 145. Although the portrait appears as the frontispiece in the Myoshinji taikan (1972), the monastery refused to grant me permission to reproduce a photograph of the image here, thus indicating a secondary level of prohibi- tions accumulating around Kanzan. 146. The term used here, shoso, refers to the image installed in the monks' hall, often of Manjusri but also of arhats such as Maha-kasyapa and Pindola. See Matsuura Shuko, Zenshu kojitsu sonzo no kenkyu (Tokyo: Sankibo Busshorin, 1976), 233-44. I thank Nedachi Kensuke for pointing this out to me. 147. The compound I have rendered as "austere and magnificent" may have Taoist connotations referring to the emaciated, withered shell of an immortal. I thank Patricia Berger for this observation. 148.

Nedachi Kensuke has identified two other chinso statues that changed identities over time: the portrait of Ketsuo Zeei (d. 1378) at the temple Zorokuan, which became Daikyu Shonen (1215-1289), and the portrait of Ichu Tsujo (1349-1429) at Shoden Eigen'in, which became Yiweng Shaoren (Japanese: GioJonin, 1217-1281); Nedachi, Kashima bijutsu kenkyu (nenpo dai 12 go bessatsu) (Tokyo: Kashima Bijutsu Zaidan, 1995), 114. In a personal correspondence to the author (une 28, 1998), Robert Sharf speculated that Huineng's (d. 713) famous mummy, which disappeared and reappeared, may be "actually another mummy that was brought in to do service." 152. Foulk and Sharf, 202, 205. The usnisa is the protruberance on a Buddha's head, normally invisible to the unawakened. As Faure, 1991, puts it, "... the true chinso is no chinso, or conversely that the 'truth' (in painting; shin) is not true, because the true characteristic, form, or aspect (Ch. xiang, J. so) is not a characteristic, form, or aspect that can be seen" (175). 153. Translated by Norman Waddell, in Maruoka, vol. 1, nos. 19, 61. 154. Temporary deconsecration of an image's spirit prior to movement presumably accompanied the aforementioned cases, such as the relocation of NanpoJomyo's statue to Daitokuji in the 16th century. 155.

In personal correspondence to author (June 28, 1998), Robert Sharf commented, "... it doesn't matter so much what the image looks like, so long as its identity is established. In other words, I think the issue of 'likeness' is somewhat of a red-herring: a chinso is a ritually prescribed 'likeness' of the departed; in a pinch a portrait of another master will do, as long as it is re-identified as such." 158. See Faure, 1991, 318. 159. Foulk and Sharf, 204. 160. Ibid., 208. 161. Sharf himself suggests, "... it is doubtful that such scholastic formula- tions ever had much purchase on the ground. Nor did they need to.... Individual icons and relics were powerful forces to be approached not conceptually or philosophically, but rather through the medium of worship and ritual." It is precisely at this level of experience, I would argue, that the form and visual presence of the icon matter. See Robert Sharf, "On the Allure of Buddhist Relics," Representations 66 (Spring 1999): 86. 162. Faure, 1998, 790; Malcolm David Eckel, To See the Buddha: A Philosopher's Questfor the Meaning of Emptiness (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992), 65. 163. See Faure, 1996, 259. That chinso were linked to the types of magical events we typically associate with traditional icons is suggested by the Chinso reikenki, a chronology of the production of and miracle associated with a portrait of Muhon Kakushin; in Hanawa Hokiichi et al., eds., Zoku gunsho ruiju (Tokyo: Zoku Gunsho Ruiju Kanseikai, 1930), vol. 13, 1069-70. We might also ask: Do chinso matter "(w)hen art becomes critical to the process of ritual conduct (and) a line is crossed from text to picture in the instantiation of doctrine"? Yiengpruksawan (as in n. 3), 392. 164. Chinso have been segregated from discussions of Buddhist iconography and visuality because of their categorization as "portraits" and the modern "rhetoric of likeness," while the Chan/Zen ideology of Dharma transmission has been used by some scholars to separate chinso from portraits of patriarchs in other schools of Buddhism. 165. Here I borrow from Cynthea Bogel, in her manuscript "The Object of History: Canonization and the Nyoirin Kannon Statue at Kanshin-ji." Bogel argues that art and ritual share the same goal, "to empower the devotee by his partaking of the source of power. To say that one (art or ritual) serves the other misstates their relationship." 166. Eckel (as in n. 162), 66. On the icon creating the invisible, see Faure, 1996, 272. 167.

For the use of real garments, see Samuel C. Morse, "Kyusai no yosoi:Juni,jusan seiki no rakei zo," in Tokyo Kokuritsu Bunkazai Kenkyujo (as in n. 5), 186-202. 172. The Shinjuan statue of Ikkyu and a second portrait at Shuon'an, which also had implanted hair, are partially reproduced in Brinker and Kanazawa, 86-87. Other examples include the portrait of Shinran known as the "Icon with implanted hair" (Uegami sonzo); referred to in Miyako meisho zue (1780) (as in n. 26), 77. 173. Keishijunkenki (1767-68), in Koma, vol. 2, 154. 174. Statues shown or photographed with their hands empty, without meditation staff or whisk, seem to evoke, ironically, the ways in which formal features and hand-held objects propel the image beyond its material form into animate presence. See Kyotofu, 1978b; and Nishikawa. 175. Even if interpreted as a dilution of religious practice or commodifica- tion, the volume of chinso production at Daitokuji (which implies recurring visual, ritual, and social negotiations between subjects, artists, patrons) is still, I believe, indicative of the value of these images in the (perceived or real) dissemination of charisma. See Faure, 1996, 260. We might also note the hierarchy, or at least interrelationship, of portraits and nonfigured spirit tablets. The Portrait of Nagao Masakage and His Wife (before 1609, Jokeiin, Yamagata Prefecture) portrays the couple, its principal mortuary subjects, in figural form seated in the foreground, while representations of spirit tablets inscribed with their Buddhist names hover above them flanking an icon of the descending Buddha Amida. Also important is the tradition of "pictured spirit tablets" (e ihai), in which portraits occupy the fronts of spirit tablets that usually display only the subject's mortuary name. The Jokeiin portrait and an example of e ihai are reproduced in Tazawa Hiroshi, Josei no shozo (Nihon no bijutsu 384) (Tokyo: Shibundo, 1998), nos. 2, 129. 176. The prominent iconic value accorded portraits of founding abbots within subtemple altars is also indicated by their priority in temple inventories and other texts that order things. See Levine, chap. 7. 177. See Levine, chap. 4. 178. Sekko Soshin's inscription of 1470 on the painted portrait of Kanzan states that prior to the portrait's production the Founder's Hall enshrined only a spirit tablet. 179. For Takuan's aniconic rhetoric, see Zen Bunka Kenkyusho, ed., Takuan Zenji itsuwa sen (Kyoto: Zen Bunka Kenkyusho, 1998), 74-86; and Yamada and Ito, 418. Takuan's enso installed at Nanshuji is reproduced in Sakaishi Hakubutsukan, Takuan, Kogetsu to sono jidai (Sakai: Sakaishi Hakubutsukan, 1983), no. 11. 180. See Faure, 1996. For Takuan's portraits and portrait inscriptions, see Sakaishi (as in n. 179). In 1616, Takuan performed an enshrinement ceremony at the temple of Sukyoji in Hyogo Prefecture for a statue of the founding abbot, Daido Ichii (1292-1370). See Yamada and Ito, 357-58. 181.

Donald Lopez Jr. describes the Tibetan tradition of "treasure texts" (gter ma) hidden in the landscape to be discovered "at the appropriate historical moment." Perhaps our discovery of the inscription hidden in the Korin'in statue comes at a time when art history is ready for it. See Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998), 106. 187. The portrait statue, unlike a painted portrait bearing an inscription, has no visible text to confirm or contradict a particular identification. 188. Enhancing the temple's cultic profile through acquisition of the portrait may have been a means toward financial recovery. Takenuki, 1993, describes efforts of the monk Kozan Sokei to revive the financially troubled temple Kawarayadera in Omi during the mid-17th century by promoting the legend of the temple's founding by Shotoku Taishi and a miracle associated with its image of Kannon (557-60). 189. The identify of the icon at Muroji could be altered with relative ease since "the sculpture had iconographical traits that could be interpreted accordingly and did not require physical alteration"; Fowler (as in n. 128), 123-32. The Daitokuji subtempleJukoin enshrines a founder's statue that has an extra head, kept in the storehouse (Levine, 369-73). 190. Maintenance of and expectation for conventional form may in fact have contributed to the statue's affective power. 191. Freedberg, 191. 192.

I do not wish to imply that context entirely explains or controls the object but rather that they are contingently related or reflect on each other. The portrait operates within its architectural and ritual setting and within the dispensations of particular viewers, but it makes that setting operate by virtue of its own appropriate and compelling form. See Norman Bryson, "Art in</page><page sequence="33">104 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 1 Context," in Studies in Historical Change, ed.

We might also imagine the potency of such iconic spaces by negating them, namely, by scrutinizing the disruption of context and by comparing statues in situ with those on exhibition in museum settings. The architectural and ritual ascription of identity to portraits is suggested in Dehejia (as in n. 137), 41-43. See also Sharfs discussion of the ritual and physical framing of icons signaling identity and status (as in n. 161), 81, 89-90. 198. Yamada and Ito, 33. 199. Despite the Meiji persecution of Buddhism and the desacralizing, aestheticizing effects of modern (Western) "rationalism" (see Guth; Faure, 1998), not all icons were rendered inert and not all ritual communities were dispersed. Physically reduced and financially retrenched, Daitokuji and its remaining subtemples still conducted rites of the Buddhist calendar and those specific to the monastery, and in 1872, it consolidated ongoing monastic practice into a new monks' hall. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, moreover, its abbots still sat for and inscribed chinso paintings, and portrait paintings and statues remained the focus of memorial ritual. See Maruoka, vol. 3, nos. 340, 343, 356. 200. For Zen memorial ritual, see Levine; Foulk and Sharf; William H. Bodiford, Soto Zen in MedievalJapan (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1993), 185-208; and Faure, 1991. Recited texts included the Heart Sutra (Hannyashingyo), the Lotus Sutra (Hokkekyo); the Kannon Sutra (Fumonbon); "Suramgama Spell" (Ryogonju); and "Spell of Great Compassion" (Daihishu). The spells are in Taisho shinshu Daizokyo (as in n. 42), no. 19, 945: 139-41, no. 20, 1060: 106-11. These texts are listed in subtemple inventories, and examples of nenko and eko are recorded in discourse records and preserved at Daitokuji. Jofu's discourse record includes a nenko verse for the 100th memorial of Kaso Sodon, in Daitokuji (as in n. 43), vol. 3, 266. 201. Foulk and Sharf refer to practices performed for the portrait that were analogous to those performed for the living abbot (192). The display of relics and manner of approaching a portrait to make offerings are described in monastic codes. 202. On death verses, see Faure, 1991, 187-89. 203. In subtemple inventories we find "Portrait Biographies" (Miei gyojo) and discourse records listed alongside entries for abbot's portraits.

See, for example, Dietrich Seckel's definition of true portraiture as "understood as a physiognomic likeness based on direct observation of a living person," in "The Rise of Portraiture in Chinese Art," Artibus Asiae 53, nos. 1-2 (1993): 7-26. 205.
