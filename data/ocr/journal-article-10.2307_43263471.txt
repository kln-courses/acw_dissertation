<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kristeva 's feminist refiguring of the gift In the continuing task of that deconstructing or 'overcoming' of Western metaphysics which postmodern thought has inherited from Heidegger, as well as Nietzsche, it is becoming apparent that the redefinition of Western models of 'thinking' is inseparable from the articulation of a new position and 'subject' of knowledge.1 While in the first instance this implies that the postmodern discourse in relation to or around philosophy cannot avoid a simultaneous engagement with some version of psychoanalytic discourse (specifically, with the legacy of Lacanian psychoanalysis, which began so influentially to extend the phenomenological critique of Western metaphysics to the unified subject of metaphysical speculation, the 'subject who is supposed to know'), several of the most recent contributions to this interrogation of subjectivity along with thinking point beyond the established boundaries of psychoanalysis, as well as of philosophy, in the direction of states and experiences which both these discourses have typically treated with mistrust. Thus the intersection of psychoanalysis with philosophy, although it was first explicidy negotiated by Lacan, has borne some of its most challenging fruit in the works of Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray, who have both, to different degrees, gone beyond the Lacanian limit, in exceeding the master's conception of his project. Although these thinkers have often been contrasted in recent years, it is my view that the intersection between key aspects of their work is far more extensive than their commentators have suggested. Both Kristeva and Irigaray have founded a critique of the rational- ism of Western society since the Renaissance upon the psychoanalytic space of the pre-oedipal, although each accords a different priority in her writing to philosophy and psychoanalysis respectively. And, as I have suggested elsewhere, Kristeva and Irigaray have each made vital contributions to a feminist restructuring of that pre-oedipal space by deploying notions of 'opening' and 'spacing' which are derived from phenomenology and deconstruction respectively in order to point towards the possibility of another psychic structure.2 Such a structure, their work suggests, would differ from that mapped by Freud and Lacan, above all in its different figurations of law and paternity, but</page><page sequence="2">224 Paragraph also in the different valency which it would accord to a triadic psychic organisation, as a system that could promote psychic growth and mobility along with a capacity for love, rather than stasis, restraint and despair. It is Kristeva's version of this intervention, as articulated in her discussion of the père imaginaire - the Imaginary Father of la pré-histoire individuelle - in Histoires d'amour, with which I will be concerned in this essay. But the importance accorded by her to this figure has, I believe, a striking affinity to the role accorded by Irigaray to the angel in 'La croyance même' and Ethique de la différence sexuelle, as a bearer and facilitator of love who occupies the place between.3 Certainly, Irigaray's recent emphasis upon questions of love has been of equal importance to the work of Kristeva in redirecting intellectual interest to the complex relationship of love with the category of woman. Through her work on the attributes of this space of the pre-oedipal, which (significantly) she renamed as the semiotic chora, Julia Kristeva has for more than twenty years been engaged in elaborating - and simultaneously critiquing - key aspects of the Lacanian project: most importantly, against Lacan 's account of the unconscious as 'structured like a language', Kristeva has often stressed the non-verbal affinities of chora. In the process, she has made a subtle yet extremely important contribution to the expansion of postmodern conceptions of 'thinking'. In the text which was first published in French in 1983 as Histoires d'amour, and translated (in 1987) as Tales of Love, she points to the need to found an emergent postmodern subjectivity upon a discourse around identity which privileges affect and the giving of love, instead of an endless quest for the absolutes of objective know- ledge. Such a discourse, Kristeva suggests, is urgently needed, in order to 'take the place of this religious discourse that's cracking now'.4 Moreover, in Tales of Love she implies that the new discourses and structures of subjectivity can only be elaborated via a reassessment of the now discarded religious paradigms which predated the emergence of modernity. As a number of thinkers have recently begun to demonstrate, postmodern thought since Nietzsche combines with its apparent nihilism a striking concern to reassess and redefine the relevance to its thinking, not only of a previously degraded sphere of feeling, but also of themes of the sacred, numinous or uncanny.5 Tales of Love is an important example of this trend, and offers insights into its complexity as well as its importance for a postmodern rethinking of subjectivity. For one of Kristeva's central concerns in this book (as also in In the</page><page sequence="3">Kristeua's feminist refigurittg of the gift 225 Beginning was Love ) is to elaborate a new analytic stance which she specifically identifies as an antidote to nihilism. She contends that: 'What today's analyst must do ... is restore to illusion its full therapeutic and epistemological value'.6 My concern in this paper is with the implications of these quasi-religious themes in Kristeva 's attempt to define a new philosophy - and experience - of love, a love which exceeds or differs from Freud's influential model of desire in important respects. Such a knowledge or state, she suggests, can help to cure the crises of the modern era, through the construction of a new psychic structure and a new capacity for idealisation. In drawing upon the psychoanalysis of Freud and Lacan in order to pass beyond it, Kristeva is by implication influenced by the Nietzschean conception of going beyond ( übergehen ), as well as by French reformulations of the concept, above all in the writings of Blanchot and Derrida, as le pas au-delà ; at the very beginning of Tales of Love, she refers to 'an exaltation beyond ( au-delà de) eroticism'. But at the same time, in a manner which both resembles and yet is different to the Nietzschean meditation upon time which complements this going beyond, Kristeva also associates her exploration of love with a return to the questions of temporality which she had addressed in 'Women's Time',7 referring to 'the non-time of love', and asserting that 'love and the loved one erase the reckoning of time' (TL, 5). Blanchot wrote of the curious relationship between time and 'the step beyond' that: 'le pas au-delà, which is not accomplished in time, would lead outside of time, without this outside being timeless . . .'.8 Thus if, as the French title of Kristeva 's book suggests, love or 'amour' is embedded in and inseparable from history, insofar as the 'histoires' or tales of the title are 'of love, they also depend from and are subordinate to it; love, like the 'father of pre-history' who is here delineated as its source, is consequently implied to come, if not first, at least before historical time (as indeed love once did, when it was held to have emerged from chaos in the ancient Greek cosmogony of the Orphies). Moreover, Kristeva's Tales of Love fissures the singularity of a linear model of history. It does this, not only by converting history into a series of tales, but also by its claim for the relevance of past epochs of Western cultural history to our possible future(s), by turning back to the premodern in order to think the postmodern. In this respect Kristeva is echoing the preoccupation of Heidegger in On Time and Being with 'the time space of true time', which 'consists in the mutual reaching out and opening up of future, past and present'.9 Indeed, like postmodern thought in general, whose paradoxical historicity is only</page><page sequence="4">226 Paragraph now beginning to be recognised, Tales of Love is deeply embedded in Western intellectual history, looking back by implication to the nineteenth-century intellectual agendas of Saint-Simon and Comte (both of whom sought to reconnect intellect with feeling), as well as of Feuerbach (who repositioned love as a mediating but material and human concept in his anti-Hegelian discourse in a way which anticip- ates the thought of Heidegger, Irigaray and Kristeva); to Platonism and Neoplatonism; and also to the theology of the middle ages. It is the middle ages, however, which enjoys a privileged position in Kristeva 's eclectic and sketchy cultural history of love (this is even implied, incidentally, in her selection of a medieval depiction of love for the cover of her book). In this respect, her rethinking of key Freudian concepts deviates quite markedly from the cultural preferences of Freud himself; as Carl E. Schorske has shown, Freud had nothing but horror when he encountered the remnants of medieval Catholicism in Rome: 'I found almost intolerable the lie of salvation which rears its head so proudly to heaven'.10 Yet it is figuratively consistent with Kristeva's interest in the 'between', or middle, that crucial aspects of her argument about love as a third term derive from her readings of texts of the medium aevum or middle ages of Western culture. The idea of the turn or return which haunts so much postmodern writing is indelibly marked by association with the return of Nietzsche's Zarathustra, with its perplexing conno- tations of a non-teleological - but enclosed and circular - model of temporality. Yet in postmodern thought this Nietzschean 'turn' is often refigured as a turn to the between or middle. Versions of this demi- or half-turn (which is more of a turn aside or écart than a return) appear in the writings of Heidegger, Derrida, Irigaray and others, and even seem to have been anticipated in the works of those early nineteenth- century philosophers whose influence, acknowledged or not, also seems to overshadow postmodernism: Comte, Saint-Simon, Hegel." In Tales of Love, Kristeva points out that the vital psychic space which modernity has destroyed was constituted at the beginning of the Christian era, and notes that the death of the Christian God (as articulated by Nietzsche) was in a sense synonymous with the death of love, since it removed a ternary psychic structure (of father, mother and child) from the realm of what Lacan has called the imaginary, leaving only an uneasy binary relationship between mother and child to dominate the pre-œdipal psyche (TL, 61). It is for this reason that, in the middle of the book, she returns to medieval Christian mysticism to explore what she believes is now an anachronistic, triadic model of</page><page sequence="5">Kristeva 's feminist refiguring of the gift 227 love, which she characterises as 'a disinterested gift' (don gratuit). Earlier, she has asked: Are not two loves essentially individual, hence incommensurable, and thus don't they condemn the partners to meet at a point infinitely remote? Unless they commune through a third party: ideal, God, hallowed group. (TL, 3) And now she claims that the rejection, during the Renaissance, of a definition of identity in terms of love had disastrous consequences for Western subjectivity. She suggests that when the Ego affectus est of a medieval thinker such as St Bernard of Clairvaux was replaced by the Cartesian Ego [as] cogito, the resultant definition of identity, which was of course in terms of rational thought, produced a profound narcissistic crisis - a crisis whose consequences we have only really seen in the twentieth century. As a result, she argues, modern Western culture cannot elaborate the complex triadic structure of primary narcissism. And in particular, it cannot ground narcissism in a productive encounter with otherness. There is a difficulty here in Kristeva 's argument, which is fundamental to any use of the pre-cedipal phase to explore psychic space: the analysand, poet or writer can never wholly recover le temps perdu of childhood, but can only half remember and reconstruct it, as histoire, as they too turn backwards in order to move forward. In Tales of Love, as in all her other work, she is therefore much concerned with the reconstruction of this state or space through aesthetic representations - representations which not only facilitate access to long-forgotten, infantile psychic states, but which also apparently have the capacity to refigure these states to good or bad effect. Hence there is often an indecision apparent in much of her work as to what has priority: the infantile experience, or its cultural refigurations in religion, art, philo- sophy - and in the psychoanalytic encounter. In any case, it is to cultural, and specifically religious, representations that Kristeva turns in order to theorize a forgotten or buried psychic potential for love. Freud too had figured this capacity in terms of religion, and in Kristeva's account of the 'primary identification' which engenders this experience, faith is seen as a characteristic, if unsatisfactory metaphor. But her preferred metaphor in her rethinking of the religious refiguring of this concept is that of the gift, and in the use of this figure for primary identification, I see Tales of Love as articulating an unacknowledged, yet extremely important, dialogue with key aspects of the thought of Nietzsche and Heidegger, as well as with Derrida.</page><page sequence="6">228 Paragraph This love which can facilitate the first encounter of a subject-to-be with alterity is significantly differentiated by Kristeva from desire. She notes the typical feeling, 'during love, of having had to expend if not give up desires and aspirations' (TL, 1, my emphasis). Thus she writes of love or 'affect' in St Bernard of Clairvaux: As bond between man and externality, God, and things, the affect is a notion closely related to desire. The difference between the two may reside in the following: desire, as we shall see, emphasizes the lack, whereas affect, while acknowledging the latter, gives greater importance to the movement toward the other and to mutual attraction. (TL, 155) While desire or eros is active, Kristeva stresses that the human experi- ence of love (as affect or the Christian agape) is initially passive. Here love as an outside force acts upon the psyche, and thereby produces movement; this movement is a response to rather than a search for love: 'An outside agent is needed for the soul, thus set in motion, to show an affect in response' (TL, 156). In the opening pages of Tales of Love, Kristeva figures this agency in the impersonal and abstract guise of 'a call', thereby hinting from the beginning at the intersection of her amatory discourse with Heidegger's thinking of Dasein, which he described as responding to a 'call' to authenticity (TL, 5). Later, however, she will link this agency with the anthropomorphic god of Christianity. This God was idealized, according to Kristeva, precisely because he was seen as loving. And he was consequendy identified with. She explains this process with reference to Freud's notion of the Einfühlung or primary identification with the father of individual pre-history. But she sees the opportunity for idealisation and identification as typically unavailable to the modern psyche, with most damaging consequences: 'a psychic structure that lacks an identifying metaphor or idealization tends to realize it in that embodied object called somatic symptom' (TL, 37-8). In Christian theology, notes Kristeva, agape descends in the form of a sacrificial (and an ultimately edible, assimilable) gift, which is the incarnation of Christ. Nietzsche's Zarathustra, on his descent from the mountain at the beginning of Thus Spake Zarathustra, had stressed the difference of the 'gift' ( Geschenk ) which he brought to man from the love offered by the god of Christianity: 'What did I say of love? I am bringing mankind a gift.'12 In reemphasizing - and reinterpreting - the association of love with giving, Kristeva rejects this Nietzschean formulation; at the same time, she implicidy alludes to the enigmatic association between giving and</page><page sequence="7">Kristeva's feminist refiguring of the gift 229 Being in the later work of Heidegger, as well as to more recent meditations on that move. Heidegger's aphoristic remark that 'It gives Being' (Es gibt Sein) has exercised a number of French thinkers in recent years, most notably Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and the Heideggerian theologian Jean-Luc Marion. In one of Derrida 's earliest references to the Heideggerian gift, in Glas (1974), he suggests that this gift or present cannot escape that logic of presence which he sees as permeating even the later works of Heidegger; he alludes there to the gift which 'upsurges "before" philosophy', asserting that this gift 'has for its destination or determination, for its Bestimmung, a return to self in philosophy'. 13 Yet Gerard L. Bruns has suggested in Heidegger's Estrangements that the step back (or turn aside) in the direction of an earlier thought, pace Heidegger, is valuable precisely because it facil- itates a letting go (Gelassenheit), and a receptive listening to difference. 14 And in Heidegger's return to his key concepts of Being and Time in his late work, On Time and Being, with a discussion of the Es gibt Sein and the Es gibt Zeit (It gives Being/It gives time etc.), it is precisely this act of giving which is held to elude those metaphysical and ontotheological speculations that he admits have continued to overdetermine his thinking of Being and Time: To think Being explicitly requires us to relinquish Being [Sei«] as the ground of beings [des Seinden] in favour of the giving which prevails concealed in unconceal- ment, that is, in favour of the It gives [Es gibt]. As the gift of this It gives, Being belongs to giving. As a gift, being is not expelled from giving. Being, presencing is transmuted. As allowing-to-presence, it belongs to unconcealing; as the gift of unconcealing it is retained in the giving. Being is not.15 It is therefore Heidegger's incorporation of giving into his thinking of Being which enables him to say 'Being is not'. His account of the gift is expressly intended to circumvent the teleology and regulation later attributed to it by Derrida in Glas.i(" In according a new psychic specificity to Es gibt, through its affiliation with a hitherto unexplored aspect of her semiotic chora, Kristeva also gives a new significance to its uncanny capacity to elude or reconfigure those concepts of regulation and definition which Derrida implies must always confine the 'free' gift, in relation to a restricted economy; much later, in Given Time I, Derrida will associate these forces with 'the time of the king': in other words, with the father's law.17 In Tales of Love, the difference putatively opened up by this trace of the Heideggerian gift is very much oriented to an</page><page sequence="8">230 Paragraph unspecified, 'open' future which is multiple rather than singular. In Powers of Horror, Kristeva indirectly alludes to the project of the late Heidegger in relation to the gift when she comments that the only place proper to the analyst is ' the void, that is, the unthinkable of metaphysics'.18 And in Tales of Love, she defines this place as that of the Imaginary Father. She further suggests that if 'the old psychic space, the machinery of projections and identifications that relied more or less on neurosis for reinforcement, no longer hold[s] together ... it may be because another mode of being, of unbeing, is attempting to take its place.' But, she contends, 'We should not attempt to give it the outlines of the "own proper self" . . .' (TL, 379-380). Instead, she suggests, we should see this crisis as 'a work in progress' whose outcome may not as yet be defined. Yet in looking forwards, à l'avenir, Kristeva accords to psychoanalysis the task of enabling the psyche to experience a state comparable to, yet not identical with, Christian agape or love in a secular era. Lacan's account of the formation of the ego at the mirror stage, which has been enormously influential, stresses the specular character of that beginning. But the self-love with which Kristeva is concerned in her rethinking of love, the self-love which she believes can restore a lost psychic space to the melancholy narcissists of contemporary culture, crucially precedes specularisation as well as access to language. Just as the child of the Lacanian mirror stage accords an imaginary and illusory wholeness to its image as first perceived in the mirror, so Narcissus misrecognises himself in the watery mirror in which he eventually drowns: in the Ovidian version of his story, from the Metamorphoses, this end has been pre-determined by Nemesis (or Fate) as a punishment for his self-love. In theorising an earlier moment of self-love (primary narcissism), Kristeva is attempting to excavate and reclaim a different, and less destructive model of (self-)recognition through the other, one which is not tragic in its implications, since seemingly it has the capacity to transform the relationship of the emergent individual to abjection and hence to the death drive - a force which Freud as well as Kristeva sometimes figures as Fate or Neces- sity.19 (Necessity is a term which Freud borrowed from the Greeks, and perhaps specifically from the tragic dramatists, who wrote of the tragic hero as being under 'necessity's yoke'. The feminine gender of the several Greek concepts associated with fate or necessity - ananke, moira, parca - has been picked up by Sarah Kofman in her critique of Freud's half-repressed association of the mother with the death drive.20)</page><page sequence="9">Kristeva's feminist refiguring of the gift 231 Kristeva therefore goes back to Freud - to Totem and Taboo as well as to The Ego and the Id - in order to find a place for what she terms paternal love in the pre-oedipal psyche. From Freud, she recovers what he called the archaic father of prehistory. Yet this disinterment is not so much the rediscovery of a person as of a place or state- an opening in the pre-linguistic space of chora which creates a space between the symbiotic dyad of mother and child. In an ecstatic experience of sensuous immediacy, the child's attention is diverted and turned away from the mother through the creation or intervention of this third position, whose interpellation clearly anticipates the severe father who intervenes at œdipalisation, but with an important difference. The Imaginary Father is identified as the source of a mysterious and unsolicited profusion of love that leads to what Freud calls primary identification ( Einfühlung ). In this transferential process, the emergent subject merges with or empathetically assimilates the Imaginary Father, whose capacity to own yet simultaneously transmute the death-drive through this sacrificial process is aptly figured in Kristeva's stress on his ghostly or non-existent character, as a signifier or metaphor which (like the gift of Heidegger's Being) is not. Here the chasm which opens up at the beginning of differentiation from the mother is transferred to the place of the Imaginary Father, who thereby antici- pates, Kristeva contends, the metaphoric character of all signification. Since t this moment of self-discovery and self love in relation to alterity precedes the mirror stage, it is described by Kristeva as impossible to apprehend in terms of a centered or focussed vision; she reminds us of Freud's comment in Totem and Taboo about 'the sun- drenched face of the young Persian god', Mithras, which 'has remained incomprehensible to us'. Freud compared this god, as well as Christ, to the subject of Einfühlung, since each had, in a different way, replaced the father without generating an Œdipal feeling of guilt in the collective because of this act. Kristeva interprets the 'luminous jouissance ' associated by Freud with the face of Mithras as a central metaphor of primary identification, reminding us that Einfühlung with the Phallus which is desired by the mother 'amounts neither to being the mother's Phallus nor [to] entering the Œdipal drama'. And in elaborating Freud's fleeting comments about the 'halo of light surrounding' the young Persian god, she reemphasises the spiritual or numinous qualities attributed to this position.21 For apparently this present of love confers, through the immediacy of identification, what Kristeva, in a Hegelian formulation, calls parousia, or 'the presence of the Absolute in knowing' (TL, 39). This 'presencing of the present' (as</page><page sequence="10">232 Paragraph eonta or what is present, as well as das Geschenk, the gift) was associated by Heidegger with the activity of fate or Moira.22 And as he noted, the process simultaneously involves a movement of withdrawal or concealment - a theme to which Kristeva appears to allude in her emphasis upon the metaphoric character of this place or state. In Glas, Derrida has played on the punning - but at first sight most unlikely - relationship between the Sa of Hegel's Absolute Knowledge (Savoir Absolu ) and the ça or id of the Freudian unconscious, which dominates the process before ego formation. A similar metamorphosis (albeit without the puns) is implicit in Kristeva's account of the parousia associated with the Imaginary Father. For while at Œdipalisation Sa implicitly manifests itself in Satur nian and devouring form, as the harsh father who embodies judgement, here it shows a different, benign face, as an 'It' (ça, Es) which creates Saturnalia as it paradoxically anticipates the law of the œdipal father through its inversion. It (f a) is multiple and heterogeneous, rather than singular in effect, effacing and myster- iously negating itself in an unmerited gift requiring no exchange (Heidegger's Es gibt). From a religious perspective, this gift amounts to grace, forgiveness, blessing, in a suspension (which is nonetheless both literally and metaphorically avant la lettre) of the judgmental father or père sevère.23 Thereby, It (ça) constitutes 'the basis of imagination itself', enabling a new, metaphoric and playful relationship to that un- representable, uncanny nothing or void which subtends and makes possible representation - as well, Kristeva asserts, as the structure of primary narcissism (TL, 45). The mysterious affinity noted by Freud between the id (German: Es) and the superego associated with the Œdipus complex is thereby hinted at.24 Yet the subject which emerges from this process of identification is importandy different from con- ventional (post-Lacanian) notions of the subject, in that in figurative terms it has accepted death, through an immediate and ecstatic identification with the self-sacrificing giver of love. But to what extent does the Imaginary Father represent a love which is significandy different from the maternal jouissance which brings it into being? As Gayatri Spivak has pointed out in an essay on Glas, Sa /ça also evokes sa as 'a pronoun possessing an undefined feminine object'.25 And Derrida has recently noted that Es gibt in French is ça donne: a version of the verb 'to give' which reemphasises woman as donor.26 This suggests an affinity, hinted at by Kristeva, between the lady of the troubadours (often addressed in verse as midons or my lord) and the Imaginary Father; she cites a poem by Arnaut Daniel, where the poet declares that:</page><page sequence="11">Kristeva 's feminist reßguring of the gift 233 A thousand masses I hear and I proffer And I burn a light of wax and oil So that God may give me a good outcome From her, against whom fencing is no protection . . . (TL, 285) How, then, are we to interpret this installation of the Imaginary Father within the space of the semiotic chora, whose determining (if ultimately self-effacing) influence Kristeva has elsewhere shown to be the figure of the mother? I observed earlier that this third term corresponds more to a place than to a person, as well as to the differential activity of the sign. While the Imaginary Father is closely linked with the 'oral stage' in which the child is still at least partially dependent upon the mother's body (an association which is consistent with the child's figurative consumption of this 'father' in assuming his place), this opening in the chora is clearly elsewhere in relation to the mother's body. But while the Imaginary Father has many of the attributes of Derridean diffèrance (including its deconstructive relation- ship to the between or entre), it rises up or intervenes both before the accession to language and before the imposition of sexual difference as such (with œdipalisation). Freud saw 'him' as equivalent to both parents, and Kristeva defines the 'archaic unity' of the Imaginary Father as 'a coagulation of the mother and her desire' (TL, 41). Moreover, in writing of agape, the feminine gender of the noun leads her to refer to this gift of God as elle. Nonetheless, Kristeva 's elaboration of Freud's hints about Einfühlung (with the help of Klein) points, as Freud does not, to the priority of (an idea of) the mother in enabling this event. And it is, of course, the Virgin Mary whom she persistently cites as an image of motherhood which, for all its deficiencies, facilitated or figured something akin to this process in medieval Christendom. At the same time, she argues that a recovery of the position of the Imaginary Father has important implications for the status of the mother's image in the emerging psyche. In particular, she suggests that it can protect the future subject from that abjection of the mother as the corporeal representative of death or necessity which, as she herself has shown elsewhere, plays such a vital part in the hatred of women. This gift of love therefore sublimates narcissism and protects it from illness or abjection by giving it a (pre-)'object' of identification which is its 'salvation', assisting the emergence of a more or less healthy subjectivity. For just as abjection occurs before the establishment of any clear distinction between subject and object, so too does the possibility of</page><page sequence="12">234 Paragraph identification with the Imaginary Father. In Polylogue it is already clear that it is only the Phallic Mother - the fantasy of the mother as substantial and all-powerful - which Kristeva believes it necessary to abject. And Powers of Horror suggests that there is an escape from the tragic dichotomy of maternal jouissance and its abjection. Here Kristeva notes that there is another version of the confrontation with the feminine: one which accepts its emptiness, and is even willing briefly to occupy its empty place. It only appears, however, 'in a few rare flashes of writing', for by implication, this encounter is more bodily than textual. It requires an attitude 'that, going beyond abjection, is enun- ciated as ecstatic'. The individual who seeks it must: 'Know the mother, first take her place, thoroughly investigate her jouissance and, without releasing her, go beyond her'.27 In 'Stabat Mater', an essay written in 1977, but reproduced in Tales of Love, Kristeva notes that the great Christian mystics occupied this negative and liminal place of the mother, using it to replace concrete icons of faith with a much less easily definable object of adoration: 'Freedom with respect to the maternal territory then becomes the pedestal [socle] upon which love of God is erected'.28 What is implied by this is an idea of the maternal place as stepping stone towards or pedestal of an even more abstract ideal. The Virgin Mother is here seen as the vital facilitator of access to that beyond or au-delà which is the gift of love. This ideal is nonetheless implied to have a phallic character, in the fleeting (and unexpectedly oriental) evocation of love as obelisk or column which repeats a central motif of Glas. But its evocation also points to the indeterminate character of the experience of alterity to which it alludes. For the column is merely a marker, a sign of meeting, like the pillar erected by Jacob at the place where he dreamed of the angelic ladder: 'And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for an altar, and poured oil upon the top of it.'29 Subsequently, Derrida has suggested that a postmodernism which ended modernism's plan of domination 'could develop a new relationship with the divine that would no longer be manifest in the traditional shapes of the Greek, Christian, or other deities, but would still set the conditions for architectural thinking'.30 His preference (in a text such as The Truth in Painting ) is implicitly for Judaic (non-)figures;but the monument or marker which I would wish most closely to associate with the Imaginary Father, as a père imaginaire of pré-histoire individuelle (and hence a Papa whose initials spell pi), is not the Egyptian obelisk, Roman column or Jewish pillar, for these offer nothing in the way of an opening, and so remain mere phallic</page><page sequence="13">Kristeva's feminist refiguring of the gift 235 markers. Rather it is the pre-historic gate of horn or stone dolmen, as n, whose architecture gives shape to the balance between bounded and open space that this recovery of a triadic version of love facilitates, yet which simultaneously marks an opening, a limen or boundary between different states. And indeed, in her repetition - with a differ- ence - of the two columns of Glas which Kristeva performs in 'Stabat Mater', where her text divides between personal experience and a critical, quasi- theological commentary on motherhood, the text begins with this structure, as its opening paragraph, which stresses the need for a new conception of motherhood, overarches and links the practice and theory columns beneath it. As G. Rachel Levy demon- strated some years ago, such gateways were associated with goddesses of birth and death in many prehistoric societies.31 This imaginary construct in the pre-œdipal consequently escapes from the restricted circular logic of the gift figured as a turning around a phallic column or pillar, to which Derrida alludes in Glas, testifying to the possibility of a new and less restrictive relationship between our reimagined pasts and our possible futures. In Tales of Loue, Kristeva claims that 'without the maternal diversion towards a third party, the bodily exchange is abjection or devouring' (TL, 34), and she further suggests that it is the child's identification with the Imaginary Father which in a sense endows the mother with existence. Yet mysteriously, it is only the mother who is able to bring the Imaginary Father into the child's field of awareness. Commenting in Spurs on Nietzsche's aphorism in The Gay Science, 'Women and their action at a distance', Derrida writes: 'there is no essence of woman, because she diverts and is diverted from herself: this distancing of woman is linked, again via Nietzsche, to woman as an enigmatic coup de dott.32 For Kristeva, it is similarly a diversion or turning away of the mother from her maternal place which paradoxically makes possible that gift of love which endows her with existence. Some years before she wrote Tales of Love, Kristeva had noted with fascination the peculiar gazes of Bellini's Madonnas, several of whom contemplate, not their child, but some undefined object outside of the pictorial frame: The faces of his Madonnas are turned away [détournées] , intent on something else that draws their gaze to the side, up above, or nowhere in particular, but never centres it in the baby.33 The prominence in recent French thought of the concept of the écart, the turn or deviation which is also a gap or opening, clearly owes much</page><page sequence="14">236 Paragraph to the later work of Merleau-Ponty; as I have argued elsewhere, it seems to me to draw as well on Heidegger's conception of the Kehre or turning. Irigaray and Derrida both use écart in relation to woman; but only fleetingly, in 'Motherhood according to Bellini', does Kristeva speak of the Virgin represented by Bellini as écartélée by her exile in a numinous 'elsewhere'. Nonetheless, her sidelong glance certainly allies Bellini's Mary with Kristeva 's later evocation of the mother who 'can indicate to her child that her desire is not limited to her of&amp;pring's request'. (TL, 40). And although Kristeva here uses the word 'desire', we might rather contend, within the terms of Kristeva 's argument in Tales of Love, that the angled gaze of Mary is itself a response to a gift of love, as is the luminosity which the painters attributed to her. In 'Giotto's Joy', Kristeva had hinted at the connection of this radiance with primary identification, by suggesting that the colourism associ- ated with Renaissance paintings of the Virgin actually lessened the child's dependence on the mother: ... all colors, but blue in particular, . . . have a noncentered or decentering effect, lessening both object identification and phenomenal fixation. They thereby return the subject to the archaic moment of its dialectic, that is, before the fixed, specular 'I,' but while in the process of becoming this T by breaking away from instinctual, biological (and also maternal) dependence.34 If Mary's function here is therefore implied to be as a bodily mirror of the radiance of alterity, then it is comparable to that diversion or ècartement of the mother's role as mirror which Luce Irigaray effects in Speculum, where she angles or turns that mirror aside, in order to free woman from a patriarchal logic of similitude and resemblance. For as is shown in the central chapter of Speculum, 'La mystérique', the turn or tilt of Irigaray's maternal mirror or speculum opens up a space 'beyond' the mother which is a space of mystical self-love also, although here what is discovered is the self-love of a daughter freed from the burden of the maternal role.35 In this respect, reading Kristeva along- side Irigaray hints at the feminine character of her own 'sublation' of narcissism through love (TL, 32). And as Kristeva suggests in 'Stabat Mater', in the doctrine of Mary's bodily assumption into heaven this liberation of the mother from a solely maternal role points to a potential transformation of our relationship to the death-drive, delin- eating the possibility of a herethics which owns yet transforms death (mort) through its assimilation into love (amour) as a-mort or undeath. Mary's defiance of death and assumption to the place of God, as</page><page sequence="15">Kristeva's feminist refiguring of the gift 231 daughter and bride, is indeed the theme of the 'Stabat Mater', whose music, Kristeva contends, 'swallows up the goddesses and removes their necessity' (TL, 263). While this move repeats the connection between the goddesses of love and death made in Freud's 'Three Caskets' essay, through the play on amour it gives priority to love rather than to death.36 Thus while Kristeva declares at one point in Tales of Love that she considers it a 'necessity' to maintain the authority of a severe father in the modern world, elsewhere in that work she suggests that the unsetding [ ébranlement ] of this severity, far from leaving us orphans, or inexorably psychotic, can reveal 'multiple and varied destinies' for the archaic and metaphorical paternity which she describes. Such destinies or directions, she contends, could be manifested by the clan as a whole, as well as by the priest or therapist (TL, 46). While she stresses here that the object of Einfühlung or identification is always metaphoric, Kristeva urges the analyst to accept this place of non-being, of the Imaginary Father, in the course of the therapeutic transference, and so act as a figure who can introduce difference rather than resemblance into the psyches of the doomed narcissi of the modern world. (In order to do this, however, she implies, as early as Powers of Horror, that s/he must play the part of the mystic. Indeed, given her remarks in 'Stabat Mater' and elsewhere, it seems that the analyst could only assume the position of an Imaginary Father if s/he had a relation to a certain maternal jouissance.) In this respect, Kristeva's gift of love escapes from the determinations of time as perpetual present (always the same) which were criticised by Heidegger in Time and Being. For in its evocation of an avant which is imagined and not originary, it simul- taneously opens up what is yet to come, as an à-venir which escapes from the closed circle of gift as obligation or contractual exchange. In her return to Freud's Einfühlung, therefore, I see Kristeva as tracing a philosophical as well as an analytical move. In the many echoes of Heidegger's project of thinking which are apparent in Tales of Love, Kristeva is according a new psychic specificity to that rethinking of giving which postmodern thought has inherited (however ambi- valently) from his works, as well as from Nietzsche. In the process, she seems to be pointing towards a necessary redefinition of philosophy as well as of psychoanalysis, in which thinking might recover its relationship to feeling; Emmanuel Lévinas has similarly suggested that philosophy should be 'the wisdom oflove at the service of love'.37 But Kristeva is also, less direcdy, reopening those questions of time and law which, as Derrida has reminded us, are allied to the rule of the severe</page><page sequence="16">238 Paragraph father as Saturn or Chronos. For her account of the gift locates it outside this sphere, in another space-time whose character is never clearly specified. As she begins Tales of Love by declaring: 'L'amour est le temps et l'espace où "je" se donne le droit d'être extraordinaire' (Love is the time and space where T give myself the right to be extraordinary) (TL, 12).

The first oral presentation of these essays is dated by Irigaray as 1980 and 1982 respectively; thus the elaboration of these ideas by Irigaray coincided strikingly with Kristeva's work on Histoires d'amour (1983). 4 Julia Kristeva in conversation with Rosalind Coward, in Desire , ICA Documents, edited by Lisa Appignanesi, (London: ICA, 1984), p. 25. 5 See for example Edith Wyschogrod, Saints and Postmodernism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990); Shadow of Spirit , op. cit.; Derrida and Negative Theology , edited by Harold Coward and Toby Foshay (New York: SUNY Press, 1992). 6 In The Beginning was Love , trans.

Rodolphe Gasché, in 'Floundering in Determination', in Commemorations: Reading Heidegger edited by John Sallis (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1993), stresses the 'floundering' or 'incoherence' of Stimmung (and hence of Bestimmung) in Heidegger's thought: 'If thought flounders when we try to come to grips with determination, it is because the very necessity of formulating an originary synthesis such as Stimmung, for instance, cannot avoid producing a proliferation of precisely what has to be derived - a plurality of not only improper but also sharply different notions of determination . . . different because of tone, style, tense, and, in particular, levels of argumentation' (p. 17). 17 Jacques Derrida, Given Time J, trans.

James Strachey (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1950), Freud describes the emergence of primitive religious belief as a submission to the death drive (or Necessity) which simultaneously denies it, and thereby changes its meaning (p. 93). 20 In 'The Theme of the Three Caskets' (1913), Freud associated the mother with the first of the three Fates (or Moirae), Clotho, and distinguished her from Atropos, the death goddess who cuts the thread of life, whom he rather associated with Mother Earth. But in her discussion of Freud's own fantasies and dreams, Sarah Kofman has shown how his mother was fused with ideas of fate and necessity; 'far from being a representation of untrammeled spontaneity, she stands for law and necessity: of time, Death, difference. A figure</page><page sequence="18">240 Paragraph of necessity, Parca, Moira, or Ananke, she is the one who silently teaches her child to resign himself to the inevitable, unacceptable, and stupefying necessity of Death' ( The Enigma of Woman: Woman in Freud's Writings, trans.
