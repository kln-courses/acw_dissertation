The Geometric period in Greece is a distinct cultural event characterized as much by the traits that disappeared in the Archaic period as by the lasting institutions that it engen- dered. Poised on base or tripod handle, the small bronze horse figurine remains the quintessential iconographic sym- bol of this period. While figurines of bulls and other animals continued to appear in Archaic sanctuaries, the horse was a creature of peculiarly Geometric-period interest, and for this reason provides special insight into the "aspirations et preoccupations" of Geometric Greece. It appears in art more frequently than human beings or gods and in sheer quantity surpasses all other types of votive figurines. Reflecting this popularity, the author has corralled 1,135 bronze horses known from excavations, museums, auctions, and private collections in this first corpus of a single Greek Geometric figurine type. This abundance also poses the greatest challenge to the author, for these myriad unique figurines require individual stylistic and technical analysis in order to distinguish elements of a chronological value from those of geographical variability. Although Zimmermann organizes this material along traditional lines by classifying</page><page sequence="2">1991] BOOK REVIEWS 349 the horses into regional groupings, he initiates some new ones (e.g., Locris, Phocis, Messenia), refines those previously proposed (e.g., Attica, Arcadia), and reevaluates their inter- relationships (e.g., three phases of Laconian influence on Argive style and three phases of Argive influence on Lacon- ian). Readers who found problematic the previous classifi- cations of Geometric horse styles by H.-V. Herrmann (JdI 79 [1964] 17-71) and W.-D. Heilmeyer (OlForsch 12 [1979]) may be more fully persuaded by Zimmermann's methodol- ogy, which is fully explained in part I. He first identifies as local productions the figurines that exhibit a demonstrable technical and stylistic homogeneity within a single region. This seemingly obvious approach had not hitherto been applied to the figurines: Herrmann's attributions presup- posed a link to major poleis, and Heilmeyer's study was based upon the figurines from Olympia and assumed that most were produced in local ateliers. Within each region the author systematically catalogues and describes the relevant horse figurines before examining their variations, stylistic influences, technique, and spatial-temporal distribution. This comprehensive and methodical approach frequently leads Zimmermann to new conclusions: at Olympia, for instance, he identifies 18 Attic horses where Heilmeyer found none and he records only 43.1% local products in contrast to Heilmeyer's 85.5%. Such figures substantially rewrite the history of votive production at that sanctuary. A further benefit of his typology is that unprovenienced horses in museums and private collections finally fit into consistent regional groupings. The most vexing problem to the study of Geometric bronzes is chronology. Since the sanctuary contexts of ex- cavated examples provide only general horizons, style and technique are the researcher's only recourse. Zimmermann's particular attention to technical details yields a picture that reflects differing regional paces and interrelationships. His reliance on M. Maass's (OlForsch 10 [1978]) tripod chronol- ogy for the Argive series leads him to see the invention of bronze horses as a by-product of tripod development. In his view the appearance of the first bronze horses in the mid- ninth century was an indigenous Peloponnesian phenome- non initiated by the Argives in order to embellish their bronze tripod offerings produced for the sanctuary of Olym- pia. Since most other regional styles demonstrate Argive influence at some stage, this chronology offers a unified picture of regional development. Parts III and IV examine the larger place of the horse in Geometric society and for the most part reaffirm traditional views. Zimmermann agrees that despite their votive function horses refer to aristocratic donors rather than to a recipient deity, their symbolism belonging to not the religious but the socioeconomic realm. He shares the view that horses on decorated bases served as seals. His painstaking differentia- tion of regional styles illuminates the process of "individual- ization" of communities much as previous pottery studies have done. Minor problems with organization hinder the reader. Sur- prisingly, Zimmermann eschews tables, distribution maps, and illustrated typological charts, which would help the reader follow him through this body of material. Quantified data are tucked into footnotes, which hold a wealth of sub- sidiary information. Catalogue entries often lack measure- ments and make no mention of condition. The high-quality plates have no scale and the photographs are not reproduced at 1:1. In fact, the illustrations often mislead by reproducing horses at a uniform height despite their actual size. On plate 6, for example, horse ARG 87 actually stands twice the height of ARG 90. Although several useful indices and concord- ances appear at the back, there is no indication in catalogue, text, or index whether a horse is illustrated; the reader must continually turn to the plates to be either rewarded or dis- appointed. These are minor complaints. The clear and gen- erous illustrations include nearly half the objects catalogued (497 horses and 60 bases), and the author has chosen to illustrate those figurines not already included in the easily accessible plates of Heilmeyer, Rolley, and Neugebauer. A few horses still await illustration. Zimmermann fully appreciates the unique qualities of the horses among Geometric votives-their distribution, sophis- ticated aesthetic, and complex symbolic function paralleled by the development of significantly decorated bases-that indicate they are not simply one species in the Geometric bestiary but function in an independent system. He is less quick to acknowledge that their uniqueness is both an ad- vantage and a liability to this study. Although the horse with its special status may trace more precisely than other offer- ings the sociopolitical maneuverings of rural communities, urban centers, and their leading citizens, the narrowly de- fined scope of this study leads the author to conclusions that are on less sure ground in the larger context of Geometric culture. He summarily rejects Near Eastern and indeed any foreign influence in the invention of Geometric bronze fig- urines, an evaluation perfectly reasonable for horses but less convincing for anthropomorphic types, which appear more or less concurrently (e.g., ARG 34). Zimmermann's most important contribution may be his assessment of interre- gional relationships suggested by distribution of horse styles and exchanges of influence. This proposed "geographie artistique" lays an important foundation for understanding the frequenting of sanctuaries and the conscious selection of ex votos for a particular place. While the general patterns now await confirmation in a broader study, Zimmermann offers an important contribution toward refining the nu- ances of regionalism in the ninth and eighth centuries.
