Stating her desire to practice the sort of "deep history" outlined in Max Oelschlaeger's The Idea of Wilderness (1991), Louise H. Westling intends with her latest book "to unravel the strange combination of eroticism and misogyny that has accompanied men's attitudes toward landscape and na- ture for thousands of years" (5). If she does not altogether disentangle the strands of this complicated cultural cloth, Westling nevertheless identifies and ably discusses many of the significant literary threads involved, from ancient Sumerian hymns to Inanna and the Epic of Gilgamesh to modern</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 107 American works by Hemingway, Faulkner, Cather, Welty, and Erdrich, with occasional stops along the way to consider Emerson, Thoreau, and a handful of other American writers. Although the bulk of her analysis concerns American texts not yet a cen- tury old, Westling situates their cultural origins far back and away, in the Indo-European matriarchies of prehistory, where countless human female figurines have been found by archaeologists to accompany those of animals and plants in a wide array of artifacts apparently celebrating, without sepa- rating, cycles of human and nonhuman fertility. Touching briefly on the work of Marija Gimbutas, Gerda Lerner, and Paul Shepard, Westling sketches the facts of pastoral and patriarchal displacement of these early goddess cultures and the subsequent spread of ambivalence (at best) and antagonism (at worst) toward that ancient, intimate association of women and nonhuman nature. Both the association and the ambivalence, Westling argues, have appeared time and again in Western literary texts. Even the earliest Sumerian poetry depicts "an uneasy coexistence of competing symbolic forces" in the agricultural goddess Inanna's marriage to the pas- toral figure of Dumuzi (15), and, soon after, the much less equivocal de- struction of all that the goddess represents by Gilgamesh, whose heroic identity actually requires such domineering display of power (19). Fast-forward through several centuries and across an ocean, and one finds remarkably similar attitudes toward a feminized nature in classic American historical and literary heroes. These Westling also sees as acting out a post-colonial "habit of gendering the landscape as female and then ex- cusing their mistreatment of it by retreating into a nostalgia that erases their real motives, displaces responsibility, and takes refuge in attitudes of self-pitying adoration" (5). Emerson set the American stage for this mix when he prescribed a transcendent relation between the Me and the Not-me that furthered the project, begun during the European Renaissance, of es- tablishing nature as men's step-stool to bigger and better things. And though Thoreau did not especially succeed in reconciling and reintegrating his mentor's Me and Not-me (that is, human and nonhuman life) at least he attempted to move the discussion in that direction, away from the cool Emersonian transcendence that can too easily soothe an ecologically guilty conscience. Westling turns next to twentieth-century exemplars of that conscience: Hemingway's Nick Adams and Faulkner's Thomas Sutpen-whose machismo is virtually self-evident-and Cather's Alexandra Bergson and Jim Burden. As creations of a female author, one might expect the novels featuring these last two characters to depart from the "male semiotic econ- omy of heroic action that inscribes the individual will upon the face of the earth." But Westling finds Cather's texts just as caught as those of her con- temporaries in the same old patterns, albeit with some interesting twists, since Alexandra is a female Alexander-the-Great and Jim is less conqueror of the prairie than ambivalent chronicler of its transformation at the hands, again, of strong women like Antonia Shimerda. Thus, Cather's Nebraska books do at least partially belie the "imperialist nostalgia" their author</page><page sequence="3">108 Rocky Mountain Review inherited, insofar as they include "the disrupting subtext" of women's nego- tiations with their natural surroundings (81). This is the theme that Westling sees moving out of subtext and into text in the fiction of Eudora Welty. There, nature is not so much feminized and conquered as it is made the medium of female interaction with the human community-particularly in the form of food-and of a female self-actualization available to charac- ters who, paradoxically, can afford to lose themselves within nature, as when Virgie Rainey enters the Big Black River of The Golden Apples and knows her body's "outer layers [are] surfaces of contact rather than separat- ing boundaries" (146). In this near-isomorphic rendering of the female and the nonhuman, Euro-American figuration seems, in the example of Welty, anyway, to have come full circle. These and other close readings of American texts in light of archaeologi- cal scholarship on goddess cultures should readily win Westling's book a strong place among recent works of ecocriticism. At one point, however, she also risks a tentative foray into cognitive theory in order to make a point about the evolutionary nature of culture. Contemporary cognitive theorists maintain that the brain of Homo sapiens combines a primitive "R-Complex" (shared with other mammals as well as reptiles) with a more recent limbic system "govern[ing] emotions and perhaps altruistic behavior," as well as the still more recent ratiocinative cerebrum, and that these areas of the brain operate dialectically in both the individual and in the species as it evolves (14). Westling wants to suggest an analogous evolution long under- way within culture, where subconscious impulses (such as those contribut- ing to communal stories) and conscious efforts (like those of single authors) have interacted in the production of cultural constructs, which have in turn been linguistically inscribed. Fascinating and perhaps necessary as all this may be to the writing of deep history, it nevertheless gets the book into murky waters. On the one hand, Westling agrees with cognitive theorist Maxine Sheets-Johnstone (The Roots of Thinking, 1990) that linguistic and literary activity are "natu- rally anthropomorphic," since their evolution has necessarily been embod- ied over the millenia by "the actual physical lives of our fellow beings" (13). Yet later, wrapping up her discussion of American authors with high praise for Louise Erdrich-for whom nature is "full of active forces, equally associ- ated with males and females" (157)-Westling calls for "Concerted efforts [in future American literature] . . . to shape new metaphors for the land that are neuter and nonanthropomorphic," presumably because these may teach more ecologically correct behaviors than Westerners generally have hitherto exhibited (167; my emphasis). But how to achieve such non-person- ifying metaphors if we come by anthropomorphism honestly, that is, "natu- rally"? And why praise Erdrich's androgynous landscapes if one prefers them "neuter"? The only glimmer of hope in the first conundrum lies in Westling's suggestion that some of cultural evolution is the product of conscious endeavor-but neither the literary critic nor the theorists she cites clarify just how conscious the act of figuration can really be. On the contrary, Westling acknowledges the old and virtually universal human</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 109 tendency, prior to the rise of Western scientific rationalism, toward a per- sonifying animism in portrayals of the nonhuman-a point for either the "natural" or the "culturally subconscious" argument. As for the second diffi- culty, although Westling offers a vague suggestion that at least the gender- ing of nature as female is not a universal (and therefore not a necessary) feature of cultural constructs, this too seems problematic, given her favor- able presentation of the news that ancient goddess cultures did integrate and celebrate women and "mother" nature as the sources and guardians of all life. While it may not fully resolve all the questions it raises, The Green Breast of the New World nevertheless invites renewed appreciation of certain American texts as manifestations of the West's oldest mythic patterns-sufficient success for one book, surely, as it will take many to help us understand literature's contribution to our historical engagement with nature.
