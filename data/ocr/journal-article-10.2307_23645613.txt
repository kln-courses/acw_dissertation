<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEOMETRIC EARTHWORKS IN THE STATE OF ACRE, BRAZIL: EXCAVATIONS AT THE FAZENDA ATLANTICA AND QUINAUÁ SITES Sanna Saunaluoma Geometrie earthworks located in the interfluvial zone of the Upper Purús and Madeira river tributaries in the southwest ern Amazon are formed by ditches of varying shapes and sizes along with contiguous exterior embankments and roads ter raced with low backfill banks. The earthworks in the Brazilian state of Acre were used from 1200 B.C. to the fourteenth century A.D., indicating a continuous, collective cultural institution, a generalized regional phenomenon characterized by local variants and alterations and probably not exclusively restricted to a specified ethnic group. The carefully planned position of the earthworks in the landscape and the recurring geometric forms represented in this earthwork architecture suggest functions that were part of a tradition of shared ideology related to rituals and/or the sociopolitical activities of ancient Amazonian peoples. Recent archaeological fieldwork on two composite earthwork sites, Fazenda Atlántica and Quinauá, situated in the core location of the geometric earthworks, provides further evidence for the predominantly cere monial use of these constructions. Las estructuras geométricas de tierra situadas en la zona interfluvial de los afluentes del Alto Purús y del Río Madeira en el suroeste de la Amazonia están formadas por zanjas deformas y tamaños diversos junto con terraplenes exteriores y caminos con bajos bancales de relleno. Las obras de tierra en el estado brasileño de Acre fueron utilizadas a partir de 1200 a.C. hasta el siglo catorce A.D., lo que indica una institución cultural colectiva, un fenómeno generalizado regional caracterizado por las variantes locales y probablemente no exclusivamente restringido a un grupo étnico específico. La ubicación cuidadosa mente planificada de las obras de tierra en el paisaje y las formas geométricas recurrentes representadas en esta arquitectura de construcciones de tierra sugieren funciones que formaban parte de una tradición ideológica compartida relacionada con rituales y/o las actividades sociopolíticas llevadas a cabo por las poblaciones prehistóricas amazónicas. Las investigaciones arqueológicas realizadas recientemente en los sitios de Fazenda Atlántica y Quinauá, compuestos de obras de tierra circu lares y cuadradas y situados en la área central de las estructuras geométricas de tierra, proporcionan más evidencia para el uso predominantemente ceremonial de estas construcciones.

The monumental earthworks in Acre were dis covered only fairly recently, but the ditches and embankments are already filling in and eroding, pri marily due to present-day land use. The meaning and magnitude of a precolumbian earthwork phe nomenon of a genuine Amazonian origin are just beginning to be understood, but the possible dis appearance of these sites may be only decades away. In addition to studying them, we should also find a way to protect these unique testimonials of the Amazonian past. Acknowledgments.

Soil creep and slope wash processes that transport the fine-grained sediments will fill up, widen, and flatten the earthworks noticeably over time (O'Neal et al. 2005). Today, the forms and dimensions of the earthworks, as well as the distribution of materials, may be quite different from the orig inal ones. 2. Programa Nacional de Pesquisas Arqueológicas na B acia Amazónica was a research project coordinated by Betty Meggers and Clifford Evans of the Smithsonian Institution. For a more comprehensive general description of the archae ological research realized in Acre, see Schaan 2008. 3. The total station measurements were taken with a 600 series Geodimeter. On average, 1,320 measurements were made on each site. Given the considerable area of the sites and the available time per site, the parts with flat or simple topography were mapped sparsely, while the earthworks were measured in more detail .This means that structures that were not noticed in the field are unlikely to be visible in the surface models. The maps are based on our perception of the sites, and there might be more structures and features waiting to be found. 4. Some of the unburned bones were identified as frag ments of the upper jaw and teeth of agouti (family Dasyproctidae), a rodent with widespread distribution in the Amazonian area. The rest of the bones were of unidentified species and may have been from larger mammals and birds. 5. Caraipé is siliceous tree bark (Licania sp.) ash. 6. Mounds are found at some earthwork sites in Acre, for example, at Coqueiral, Sol de Maio (Schaan and Bueno 2008), Fazenda Iquiri II (Schaan and Bueno 2009), and Campo Esperanza (Schaan and Saunaluoma 2010), but in these cases several mounds form a circular enclosure, and therefore their function is probably different from that of the individual structure documented at the Fazenda Atlántica site. 7. Excavations at the Las Palmeras earthwork site in the Bolivian Amazon (Saunaluoma 2010) revealed that the small depression features located inside a circular ditch were filled with abundant sherds and midden debris. In addition, we observed a calcite feature in one of the depressions at a depth of 70-80 cm, but the implication of this feature remains uncertain. Today, calcite has more uses than almost any other mineral as a construction material, a pigment for paint, a field dressing, and a medication. 8. At the Fazenda Colorada site the structure linked to the enclosure is a U-shaped double ditch instead of a circle. 9. The defensive function of small circular earthworks of the Adena culture in the North American Eastern Woodlands has been discarded precisely due to external piling of ditch construction backfill (Clay 1987). 10. The JK site, consisting of two concentric square shaped ditches, was constructed in the margin of a stream so that the watercourse actually forms part of the outer ditch. However, this type of solution is uncommon in the earthwork architecture of Acre. 11. This pertains to the Macro-Gé linguistic family. 12. One of the objectives of the ongoing studies on the Aerean earthworks is to investigate the vegetation history of the region.
