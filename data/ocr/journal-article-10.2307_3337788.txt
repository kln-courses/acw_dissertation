The work under review is the result of many years of writing on traditional medicine and collecting African art, although De Smet has never actually been to Africa. Following an elegant preface by Maurice M. Iwu, De Smet provides a broad introduction to illness and health issues in Africa. His associa- tion of these topics with African arts is antici- pated by the works depicted on the book's covers and frontispiece. These are a "West Afri- can statue portraying the administration of an enema," a Bamileke statue "with a diffuse goi- ter," an Igbo kola nut dish, and a steatite sculp- ture by David Mushonga of the psychoactive plant Boophane disticha. Thus, artworks in this volume primarily illustrate illnesses or their treatment (either the processes or actual herbal plants) and works linked to diagnosis and treat- ment, such as divination implements and objects employed for healing. The chapters cover "Health," "Healers," "Intoxicants and Poisons," "Ethnopharmaco- logical Outlook," and "Documentation." This last section includes several glossaries of tech- nical and local terms for plants, diseases, and pharmacological effects and lists of references and resources. Broadly speaking, De Smet maintains that one must understand the full cultural context of health and healing in African societies in order to understand their medical systems, and that context entails the visual arts. (We would all concur with his assertion.) It should be noted, however, that he does not con- 14 sider other art categories which are, in effect, as much if not more related to healing, such as the verbal arts or dance and music. Also, because all aspects of medical practices are not depicted in known examples of sculptural works, De Smet presents some practices by means of sculptures he commissioned. In addition to images of sculptures, De Smet includes a wealth of field photographs, pho- tographs of herbal plants together with summa- ry information, depictions of plants on African postage stamps and monies, and colonial post- cards which portray ailments and treatments. There are also illustrations of personal items associated with general well-being, such as pipes, snuff bottles and kola dishes, and person- al adornment, focusing on hair pins and combs. The breadth of visual evidence linking art and health is complemented by invaluable material on the nature and uses of herbal medicines (thus the initial disclaimer), statis- tics on diseases, and valuable discussions of the values of traditional medical treatment. The final section even argues for conserving herbal plants in addition to promoting the study of their contributions to health mainte- nance in countries suffering a loss of funding for hospitals and pharmaceuticals. This work does not utilize exactly the same approach as Jacques Mercier's Art That Heals: The Image as Medicine in Ethiopia (1997) or Frank Herreman's (with B. Wagner) To Cure and Protect: Sickness and Health in African Art (1999), which investigated arts for their literal contributions to the healing process. De Smet is more interested in the depiction of ailments, such as the harelip seen on an Ibibio mask, although sometimes one feels the attributions are a bit too speculative. Nevertheless, the inclusion of rare data on such topics as poi- sons and psychotropic plants and traditional surgical techniques enhances the book's con- tributions to African ethnology. I highly recommend Herbs, Health and Healers, but perhaps not for the reasons usual- ly given in African Arts book reviews. This is one of the best volumes I have read for European and African medical evidence about traditional healing systems. The artworks de- picted are necessarily secondary to, but high- ly supportive of, the author's main concerns, and they are a fascinating collection of objects depicting and related to illness and health in Africa. Overall, the book is a valuable addi- tion to any Africanist collection. Finally, we would all do well to promote the author's conclusion in praise of recent World Health Organization support of tradi- tional healing systems (p. 152): "For indige- nous peoples, such international support is important not only in terms of public health but also as a sign that their cultural heritage and identity are recognized and respected." D AFRICANS ON STAGE Studies in Ethnological Show Business Edited by Bernth Lindfors Indiana University Press, Bloomington, and David Philip, Cape Town, 1999. 455 pp., 636 b/w photos. $35 hardcover, $16.95 softcover. Reviewed by Cherubim A. Quizon This collection of essays seeks to address the general question of how and why Africans, and to some degree African Americans, came to be displayed in faraway places and in jarringly disjointed contexts. It focuses on the notion of "ethnological show business" and its dual alle- giances to commerce and science, set in a world ostensibly made smaller by colonialism. The essays are arranged in the chronologi- cal order of the displays that are discussed, ranging from the early nineteenth century to the 1930s. The venues for the spectacles cov- ered in the book were primarily in Britain, fol- lowed by the United States, and to a lesser extent, France, Germany, and even Cuba. The discussion of circumstances surrounding the African players and their Euro-American pro- moters and spectators provide an absorbing glimpse into how mass audiences and their elite counterparts saw, or were made to see, Africans and other people of color. More im- portant, the chronological arrangement of the essays effectively delineates the changes in the rhetoric of these displays over the period of about 120 years. At the same time, a num- ber of individual essays suggest that the con- african arts * winter 2000 I</page><page sequence="2">ceptual slippage between "freak show" and "educational display" has never left us, and eerily persists to this day. Not all of Africa is covered. Of the ten essays, six deal with the display of Africans from the southern regions of the continent. Four of these discuss what are popularly believed to be the "classic" nomadic or pastoralist groups known by a number of ethnonyms-such as San or Khoi-or by more colorful, often pejora- tive, and less exact epithets-such as Bushman or Hottentot. Z. S. Strother looks at probably the earliest and best-known example from this group: Sara Baartje, the "Hottentot Venus." Her lesser-known counterpart, Franz Taaibosch, or "Clicko, the Dancing Bushman," who was put on show about a century later, is discussed by Neil Parsons. Bemth Lindfors writes about the display of Zulu "warriors" from Natal, and Shane Peacock about their subsequent public reception, while Veit Erlmann discusses a jubilee choir made up of young mission-educat- ed Africans from around Kimberley. Of the authors whose focus is outside South Africa, Jeffrey P. Green and Harvey Blume offer separate pieces on "pygmies" purportedly recruited from the equatorial region of the Congo. The two remaining chapters deal with the conundrum of African Americans posing as Africans from Africa: Robert W. Rydell elabo- rates on the ideological underpinnings of the phenomenon in American world's fairs, while joint authors David Killingray and Willie Henderson explore the double life of an Ameri- winter 2000 ? atrican arts can, Joseph Howard Lee, who created a flam- boyant alternate pan-African identity known, among other names, as Amgosa LoBagola. The book is of greatest value, then, to those who are interested in representations of Africans within a specific cultural and historical context: the business of putting on show Bantu- and Afrikaans-speaking people of color for white audiences in the colonial metropolis. A number of authors focus less on the per- formers and more on the promoters. There are essays on the life of the Great Farini, the impre- sario who exhibited both Zulus and San on both sides of the Atlantic (Peacock); on Donald Bain's "Bushman" exhibit at the Imperial Exhi- bition in Johannesburg (Gordon); and on James Henderson's role in bringing six "pygmies" to Britain and the time they spent with local peo- ple in Yorkshire (Greene). But as the intro- duction states, these essays deal with how perceptions of Africans were shaped not only by promoters and managers, whether business- man or philanthropist, but also by performers and spectators. Five essays share a strong theoretical in- terest in the manipulation of perception, the spectator end of the phenomenon. Strother ef- fectively argues that Sara Baartje was dressed (or undressed) in an anachronistic fashion in order to fit into the public's preexisting notion of how a "Hottentot" woman should appear. This iconographic retrofitting was not a neutral representational practice. It ultimately sought to present the Hottentot Venus as a racial type that is sexed but sexually revolting-the freak as type. Lindfors evenhandedly examines Charles Dickens's gratingly racist and ethno- centric writings on Zulu shows in Hyde Park as reflective of the sentiments of the London show-going audiences in the 1870s. At the same time, he points to the outwardly better informed critical language of London and New York reviewers in the 1970s that nevertheless demonstrates a fundamentally unchanged per- spective, one that posits an inherent African atavism. Rydell describes the reinvention of Africans in American world's fairs. Early on, they are embedded in an evolutionary/racial hierarchy (spiced up by the participation of seasoned African American performers). Later they are presented as "exotic curiosities," not to be taken seriously and living in a land up for grabs. By the world's fairs of the 1930s, Rydell argues that Africans have disappeared alto- gether from scenes of a prosperous, moderniz- ing Africa that is undergoing a "development removed from its own people, culture, and his- tory." Blume presents an engaging argument on the usefulness and durability of the notion of mixed genres in displays of people-what he terms "Barumism"-as he outlines how Ota Benga, a "pygmy" and ethnological-dis- play veteran from the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, ended up in the Bronx Zoo sharing a cage with a great ape. Although there is less discus- sion of Ota Benga himself than the conceptual power of blurring archetypes, Blume's explo- Continued on page 92 15</page><page sequence="3">edge of Lake Chad. Zoomorphic items were produced from the 2nd century B.C. onwards; however it is only in the 12th and 13th cen- turies A.D. that large numbers of terracotta anthropomorphic and zoomorphic sculptures, measuring between 1.5 cm and 35 cm high, were produced. These statuettes were found alongside copper alloy items, small human figurines, and more especially many items of jewelry, sometimes adorned with small-scale human heads or animal forms. A number of these human representa- tions are heavily stylized, such as cylindrical busts with eyes perforated through the clay, and a mouth marked by an incision. A spe- cial feature is the horned excrescence on top of the head. Other busts support a simple, flat oval head. Another group of sculptures, which in- clude zoomorphic representations, stylized busts and figurative human statuettes, are characterized by eyes made up of a sphere slit horizontally, and chevron incisions. The b O kS Continuedfrom page 15 rations of the term Barumism create much- needed intellectual space for the seamy side of "serious" educational displays, subtexts that are fraught with irony, play, voyeurism, and the unexpected distortions of often rigid or conventionalized content. Erlmann's essay on the African Choir begins with compelling issues of how nonwhite colonial subjects may seek an imagined, almost talismanic connec- tion with a global ecumene in a politically and culturally disconnected world. He ends, how- ever, with too little said about the choir itself, made up of young black South African men and women who toured Britain and Europe, or about the meanings that can be reasonably inferred from their dress and dramaturgy. Two essays, thematic vignettes from longer biographical works, focus on the activities of exceptional individuals. Peacock's contribu- tion on the Great Farini (born William Leonard Hunt) focuses on how differently the showman conceptualized his display of Zulus, his first foray into African entertainment genres, com- pared to the more sedate and educational exhi- bitions of San people that he produced later in his long and wide-ranging career. Peacock emphasizes the extraordinary life and persona of Farini himself, how he recruited performers and learned about Africa by traveling there, and his role in popularizing images of the Zulu and San with American audiences. Gordon's essay, by contrast, looks at Donald Bain's pet objective: setting up a "Bushman Reserve" from the public impetus he hoped to gain from the exhibition of San people in Johannesburg's Imperial Exhibition. This failed philanthropic project reflects the changed intellectual climate surrounding the display of colonial subjects in the years leading up to the Second World War. The remaining three essays deal with a more difficult and less studied subject: how the African performers lived through and respond- 92 shaven heads of the figurative statuettes are tiny, whereas the lips and chin are prominent. The short arms of the statuettes carry sashes crossed over the bust, and jewelry. Other sculp- tures are hybrid, being made up of a cylindri- cal body mounted by an animal head. Some isolated heads have their faces engraved with circle motifs. The Urgency of the Situation Most of the objects came to light during official excavations and were placed in the custody of Muse6 National du Tchad at N'Jamena. However, a part of this collection was scat- tered in 1979 at a time of political crisis. Since then, looting has also taken place at the site of the archaeological excavations themselves. The cultural authorities reacted by setting up an emergency plan to inform the population about the need to protect their heritage. There has been a special effort to promote the construction of museums by the inhabitants in the regions affected. C ed to the remarkable experience of being people on show. The essays by Green on the six imper- turbable "pygmies" who visited the Queen and Westminster, and lived for a time in Yorkshire; by Killingray and Henderson on the public masquerade and private homosexuality of LoBagola/Lee; and by Parsons on the cross- Atlantic epiphany of a brutalized Taaibosch as "Clicko, the Dancing Bushman" are works of careful scholarship. More important, they pre- sent a rather tricky premise in extremely polit- ically correct times: that within the exploitative structure of the shows, these individuals in their travels may have fueled their own intel- lectual cpriosity and even experienced personal growth. Greene makes this point subtly and provides abundant documentary evidence to support his argument that the six diminutive African men and women had an extremely var- ied impact on the considerable number of peo- ple whom they met and performed for over a number of years, and that in certain circles of both elite and ordinary Britons, they were very well regarded. Parsons makes a similar point in a more candid fashion within the context of Taaibosch's otherwise very brutal life. His description of Taaibosch's later years as a "sideshow artiste" with Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus cogently makes room for an alternate voice of "Clicko" as shaman, even within the overlay of structures of imperialism, racist paternalism, and ethnic stereotypes. The case of LoBagola is unique and research is still in progress, but the authors make it very clear that LoBagola's invention of his African persona enabled him to earn a living while enjoying a colorful and cosmopolitan life that would other- wise have been impossible for an American black man in the United States and Britain. These three essays are important and innovative works that balance the discourse on the display of exotic peoples, so that the impact is felt on either side of the stage and the disjuncture of the experience of modernity is shared. [] notes Notes, from page 25 [This article was accepted for publication in October 2000.] 1. Victor Turner, undated and unpublished manuscript, the University of Zambia. 2. Research by historians such as Joseph Miller (1969), archae- ologists including Carlos Ervedosa (1980), and others has also contributed to the body of documentation relevant to the peoples discussed here. 3. Although Jose Redinha in particular (1965, 1974) made major contributions to art history in the region, he focused mainly on collecting and cataloguing pieces, and to some extent describing them. Bastin was concerned with analyzing art styles and types, and identifying specific symbols that she interpreted with the aid of assistants. 4. Besides generally addressing style distinctions among these peoples, Bastin (1982:246-87) discusses a "style of the country of origin" and an "expansion style" meant to distin- guish nineteenth-century court art styles, mainly in figurative sculpture. 5. If one were to survey a number of museum and private col- lections, and published exhibition catalogues, it would appear that Chokwe and related peoples created only a handful of mask types. In fact they have a large repertoire of ancestral mask characters, most of which remain underdocumented. This situation is due in part to collectors' taste for wooden (vs. fiber and resin) examples. Wood is used in a selected number of character types including Pwo, Chihongo (male chiefly ancestor), and a few animals. Similarly, nineteenth-century royal figures have been the subject of several articles, although there is little or no documentation to explain their actual con- text and use. The more schematized hamba ancestral figures, another example, remain grossly understudied. 6. Some Lunda call the female character Mubanda, which also means "woman." Other names are also used. 7. The teeth recall the practice of teeth filing that was favored by the Chokwe. 8. Throughout her career, which spanned more than forty years, Mme. Bastin visited and studied a great number of museum collections, and almost everything Chokwe-related was in one way or another brought to her attention. I focus on her Dundo study here because it solidified the definitions of Pwo styles and meanings that still shape our approach to such masks. 9. For an excellent study of the Dundo museum-Portuguese colonial campaign in Angola, see Porto (1999). Dundo was established by the former Portuguese Companhia de Diamantes de Angola (Portuguese Diamond Company of Angola). 10. The sixty-seven fiber and resin masks apparently did not include any versions of Pwo made in those materials. 11. This defined style is applicable to other Chokwe anthro- pomorphic wooden masks such as Chihongo, the male coun- terpart of Pwo. 12. It is impossible to ascertain whether the Songo-collected example is actually Songo. It may very well have been carved by a Chokwe artist and bought by a Songo client. The oppo- site alternative is also possible, because masks in the same style have been documented among the Chokwe as well as the Songo. 13. Here Bastin applies an earlier definition of a Lunda style of carving (which she considers nonexistent) to the Lwena. 14. Baumann collected a number of pieces that he meant to take to Germany, but because of exportation restrictions they were left at the Dundo museum. He had earlier collected other excellent pieces that are now in Berlin. 15. A zoomorphic wooden sculpture (in my opinion a mask made to be placed atop the head as opposed to the face), excavated in central Angola and (carbon-14) dated to over 1,000 years ago, indicates an artistic tradition that predates the presence of Chokwe-related peoples in the same locale. The fact that zoomorphic masks, documented in the region since the nineteenth century, exhibit similar stylistic traits suggests a continuity that can be traced to an ancient, local model. That Chokwe became the dominant art emissaries does not mean they were the originators of particular art forms, types, and styles. 16. It may be argued that the image represents the illustra- tor's general or interpreted version of what the mask or mask performer actually looked like. However, given the large number of illustrations published by Carvalho, and the degree of detail in all the objects and scenes illustrated, I believe that the illustration is probably accurate. 17. Not all masks show scarification details. None or few scar- ifications often indicate that the character portrayed is a young person-in this case a young woman, or Mwana Pwo. 18. I base this observation on numerous examples I have seen in field performances in Zambia as well as on my study of over two hundred masks (several well documented, in private and museum collections) that are from the men- tioned regions and display similar stylistic traits (Felix &amp; Jordan 1998). 19. This. point is significant because it refutes the idea that more subtle styles are decadent or artistically less accom- plished versions of an older "classic" canon. 20. It certainly is important to document Chokwe styles in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as they may relate to those of neighbors such as the Mbangani, Luluwa, Pende, and others. 21.
