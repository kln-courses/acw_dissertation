<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSEPH BEUYS 'EXTENDS' JAMES JOYCE'S WORK Joseph Beuys had a fascination with Joyce's writings. Christa-Maria Lerm Hayes examines here how deep the influences were. In his Lifecourse/Workcourse1, the German artist Joseph Beuys (1921 - 1986) stated that in 1950 he read James Joyce's Finnegans Wake at a "Haus Wylermeer" in the Lower Rhine region. The cultural centre located there, however, had not been making use of Beuys' contribu tions and thus the reading is likely to have been a private one. Among Beuys' statements concerning Joyce, which themselves appear to be similarly cryptic, are assertions that the artist "extended" Joyce's Ulysses. Beuys also said that he wished to "do" Finnegans Wake again.2 Lifecourse/Workcourse was written in 1964 for an exhibi tion catalogue. The opening of that exhibition was celebrated with a performance festival at which Beuys earned some notoriety by being involved in a brawl. Did the artist wish to shock the public by mentioning Joyce? Are any of the references credible? In Lifecourse/Workcourse, the Ulysses-Extension bears the long title: Beuys extends James Joyce's 'Ulysses' by 2 further chapters at the author's request. This body of drawings in six exercise books dates from ca. 1957 - 61. When people visited Beuys around 1962, he had his copy of the German translation of Ulysses displayed on the window ledge. One can thus be certain that he owned this work early in his career and treasured it. Concerning the alleged Finnegans Wake-reading, however, neither was there in the past a source to match this claim, nor is there a work known to match the intention to do Finnegans Wake again. I discovered two Wake first editions in Beuys' estate, the English and the American one. The Faber and Faber edition was a gift and contains no annotations.3 The Viking Press copy, on the other hand, had been acquired second hand - and it is annotated on almost every page. When Beuys came to own this book, when he read it, underlined and drew in it, etc., cannot be determined conclusively. From the beginning of the Anna Livia episode onwards, the annotations relate closely to the text. This chapter seems to have been of particular importance; consequently it will be in the foreground here. Interestingly, wherever Joyce had worked in a visual way, e.g. on pp. 196, 293 and 308, Beuys chose not to interfere or annotate. This fact already lets all the other annotations appear as 'extensions' of the writer's visual approach to the remainder of the book. Joyce was, moreover, a visual artist for Beuys. The pages up to the beginning of the Anna Livia episode are also annotated, but in a different way in that they have words in the margins beginning with the letter 'C. My intention is to look at the Ulysses-Extension and show that these drawings are informed by Finnegans Wake. They may indeed 'do' Finnegans Wake again and may thus also have 'extended' Ulysses in the way in which Joyce himself had extended Ulysses in Finnegans Wake.4 The drawings are a nucleus for much of Beuys' later work and his ideas concerning the materiality of his sculptural substances. Therefore, some other representative works will also be introduced. Beuys mentions "The Jury" in English on one page of the Ulysses Extension, but the clearest reference to Finnegans Wake can be found in drawings of book sculptures or objects. In book 3, p. 74, one can see a book balancing on a pole with a supporting base, while the spine is curled around so that the covers approach one another. I suggest this to be as clear a visualisation of the cyclical structure of the Wake as is possible to achieve. This 'round' book appears again on the same page, seen from either the top CIRCA 104 Summer 2003 35</page><page sequence="2">or bottom, i.e., the spine appears as a small circle in the centre with the pages radiating outwards. On a different page, subsequently removed form the exercise books, Beuys uses this shape again. In his drawing Warm Time Machine, he refers to it as a sun (warmth), a clock (time) and a flower, while retaining the reference to the book. One can add a wheel to this multiplicity of meanings, since Joyce had called Finnegans Wake a machine with just one wheel and no spokes - a perfect square.5 Even in Our Exagmination, the first critical anthology on Work in Progress (later entitled Finnegans Wake), the wheel was chosen for the layout of the title. Squaring the circle is exactly what Beuys does in the writer's wake - or rather he circles the square book and adds spokes: the book |y l ^ would not be complete without its pages. This motif, open for multiple readings, can, as I would like to suggest, be called a portmanteau shape. Beuys thus goes further than simply referring to Joyce in terms of motif. He borrows his procedure and adapts it to his own genre. This portmanteau shape is located in the Warm Time Machine drawing in the area of the heart of an unidenti fiable male. The brain appears to be quite chaotic and the mouth, the area which generates speech and language, is a test tube. It would be surprising if Beuys did not think of Joyce's experimental use of language when drawing this. He could also have meant Bloom. After all, the portmanteau shape is also a flower. Formal innovations were for Beuys (unlike for most of his contemporaries in the visual arts) never important for their own sake. The social implications, warmth (sun) as social warmth and love, were to him as important as they were for Joyce, who after all chose Odysseus and conceived Bloom for their humane characteristics. The book drawing from the Ulysses-Extension took on another life of its own, one at least as multifaceted as this sun/clock/flower image. Again, the spine is a small circle. The covers, however, are nm, jm uwmwumh , j, iiipufipinjsppMM like a hill with the spine as M a sun at its summit. This layout of the beginning of the Anna Livia episode. Joyce's mentioning of ALP's "sugarloaf hat with a gaudyquiviry peak" (FW 208,07) turns the motif into a mountain hat. Beuys apparently noticed here that the peaked cap is associated with both male and female elements. The visual motif, which clearly derived from the beginning of the ALP episode, Beuys called the "Pewninus-motif " in his Ulysses-Extension after the Celtic mountain god, whose name relates not so much to the pen as to pen in the sense of pin or ben as mountain. The artist apparently followed Joyce in his way of thinking and employed their shared interest in Indo-European etymology, repeatedly accompa Joseph Beuys: James Joyce's Ulysses extended (original title: Joseph Beuys verlangert im Auftrag von James Joyce den Ulysses um sechs weitere Kapitel) (undated, six A5-format notebooks), Volume 3, pp. 26/27; courtesy Anthony d'Offay Gallery / Hessisches Landesmuseum / DACS London; all rights reserved 36 CIRCA 104 Summer 2003</page><page sequence="3">nying the diagram with the words "book with Penninus motif." Sometimes, several such motifs appear as if they were cells, one after the other, maybe denoting the different episodes. Tumescence and detumescence in Ulysses (especially Nausicaa) come to mind. In order to understand better Beuys' ideas of extending Joyce's works - and that is what it really appears to be in an intellectual way - one needs to refer to more figurative Penninus drawings by the artist. One of them shows a man reminiscent of ecce homo depictions with just such a peaked cap. Another one shows a walking man, whose upper body is covered by the peaked cap, while the legs echo its angle. This brings closer a solution as to how Beuys meant to extend Ulysses, while not MPI||II1PPP*WBIP^^ repeating anything.6 Mf As a visual artist, Beuys ?&gt;* W$ \\ knew that the peaked cap B?'&gt; '*' \ is iconographically the K JLjfe attribute of Odysseus. mLtz^1^'^^^^^0 With this link, he had BC^ -^ ^*^ discovered a fundamental mk ^^^:^^ffL? - parallel between Ulysses BF\ ~c """"""' %&amp; and Finnegans Wake. k * .- J~$m The two works in fact Bkr -~T^J^?Z~2| melt into one in more BET^^ respects than the formal HiRu * link between the cyclical HHF*a"? ^ tT *^&gt; book and the flower as HE.lpt*^ *M Bloom.

This suited his interpretation of Haus Wylermeer as the claimed locus of his Finnegans Wake reading in 1950: the house is mountain-shaped and also in reality called Wylerberg, i.e. "'mountain'. The two inhabitants of the house from 1950, however, were female. Beuys consequently changed the house's name in the Lifecourse/Workcourse to 'Wylermeer', i.e. '-sea'. Penninus appeared to be an ideal main protagonist for Beuys' Joyce-inspired work: The "mightmountain Penn" (FW 19,32) and all the connotations of writing and drawing appear clearly enough in Finnegans Wake for Penninus to be recognisable and understandable as Wake reference, while looking back to Ulysses could bring some innovation. Beuys followed Joyce in turning the seafarer Odysseus' adventures into a land-based and walking odyssey. He moreover paradoxically rendered the Wake's male protagonist, Tim Finnegan, lying in the Dublin landscape with the hill of Howth as his mountain head, as a walking mountain, Penninus. Apart from Tim Finnegan, Europe's geographical make up and cultural landscape pointed Beuys in this direction: both the Pennines in England, the Swiss Uiiaiiii. .. il ...m .p i) ^'JmJUJW^ .Ti I *"""."' .. / jr * . /^ '* ?C- *V A __-- _, *,i? \ ' J ' '- :"' * . ^- &lt; -.^**a**-**.* Pennine Alps (ALP!) and the Apennine range in Italy are named after Penninus, the Celtic mountain god. They serve as the spine in Beuys' anthropomorphic view of the continent. Ireland is then logically the 'Brain of Europe', a conviction which Beuys asserted in many of his drawings, some of them carried out on blackboards during public lectures in Ireland in 1974. Joyce, moreover, had in Beuys' view left his mark on the European landscape through his life's wanderings as much as through his work.

He also followed Odysseus. It is, I believe, no coincidence that Beuys chose to abandon his usual felt hat on a rare occasion and sported instead a peaked cap (similar in style and material to Aran jumpers) when he sailed the Mediterranean on a friend's yacht. Beuys referred to Odysseus several times - always it seems with Joyce in mind. In 1977, owning at this stage at least three books with illustrations of Joyce's drawing of Bloom contained in them, Beuys chose to accompany a blackboard drawing of his own antlered everyman with wr - -"- -^ ^ md^? the opening lines of the AjMm?:-' Odyssey in Greek, just as ^BB Joyce had done.

Beuys used further letter-based sigla from Finnegans Wake - and that is what one can call them - in his work, expanding Joyce's own visual procedures into a multifac eted and programmatically underpinned artistic practice. Beuys' annotations of deltas and staff- or 'J'-shaped underlinings in his Finnegans Wake copy clearly show that the artist consciously viewed what Joyce scholars call sigla as closely related to the writer. Beuys created many works using 'J'-shapes. In one of his last multiple artworks, Joyce's initials feature twice and in such a way that the use of the staff and the sled - one of Beuys' signature motifs - clearly appear Joyce-inspired. Joyce with Sled consists of an interview passage from 1972, carefully centred on the page - almost like in the Portrait, where Stephen determines his position. The text reads like a confession of faith: Yes, [he would begin with "yes"] there is a paral lelism and I referred to Joyce because J believed that these things, which change the universe should be a part of our consciousness. [...] this principle of self transformation is an ingredient, a substance that has been crucial, one could also say a dynamic medicine, to me. -** "" 0 ~ * * * * *~?

In fact, this yin and yang sign consists of two intertwined 'J's, alluding to how 'JJ', according to Beuys, bridged the gap between East and West, rationality and spirituality. The other two 'J's are the runners of the sled, which is shown upside down in the centre. This is peculiar, as Ireland is not a particularly cold place. But the island was Hibernia to the Romans and Joyce would therefore be 'hibernian', which in Latin also means wintry. Such word games, Beuys knew, were Joyce's staples in Finnegans Wake - and the writer was as prone to over interpreting them as the visual artist was after him. Joyce, as a spiritual writer with an interest in humanity, would therefore be well placed to serve as an example of how to negotiate the metaphorical ice around us.

Beuys as an artist followed Joyce's many eccentricities, found them entirely logical and thus turned (in many people's view) into as much of a mountainy man as the Irish writer before him had been. Having established the ways in which Beuys took up Joyce's example in terms of motifs and procedures, including creating portmanteau shapes and words, operating with sigla and phenomenological coincidences in order to let the quirky particular represent the universal - it can almost be taken for granted that the artist would claim to have received a post mortem "request" from Joyce to extend Ulysses. However, a more detailed and 'Joycean' instance within the artist's mythol ogised biography was seemingly required: Beuys spoke of a recurring daydream during his childhood, which can be linked to the Finnegans Wake reading in House 'Wylermeer'. A man dressed in black told the artist: "You are the prince of the roof. I've led the way, now you have to do things your own way."8 The Ulysses Extension drawings are the first attempt to work in such an independent way, following the depressive crisis already mentioned. The connection to Joyce is that Beuys became the 'prince of the roof (or so he wishes us to conclude) by reading Finnegans Wake in or rather on the Penninus-motif-like roof of house Wylerberg. ALP's (river) delta was indeed for Beuys a life-giving and work-inspiring force from the beginning. It is hardly surprising that Beuys then chose the two circles from the Euclidian Finnegans Wake diagram (FW 293) separated - i.e., without the gyroscope of two deltas in its centre - as an image of death. In Palazzo Regale, Beuys' last major installation, two cymbals lean on one side of the central, grave-like vitrine without overlapping one another. Life has ended. In his last Joyce-inspired wish (if not work), Joseph Beuys requested to have his ashes spread over the North Sea. He thus shares Anna Livia's fate even in death.
