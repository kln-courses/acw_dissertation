Pirott-Quintero The College of Staten Island, CUNY Abstract: The Jewish-Brazilian writer Moacyr Scliar explores Brazilian cultural multiplicity and its attendant tensions in his novel O centauro no jardim. The protagonist, a Russian Jewish-Brazilian centaur, stages the confrontation between lived interiority and collective exteriority, as he succumbs to society's assimilationist pressures that vie for symbolic expression on his unusual body. The novel's ethnic and somatic inflections highlight the effects of negotiating differences in the construction of identities. The narrative is humorous and fanciful, but at the same time incorporates a serious urgency to examine and call into question contempo- rary Brazilian representations of cultural heterogeneity. Key Words : Scliar (Moacyr), twentieth-century Brazilian narrative, body, hybridity, anthropomorphosis, ethnic identities, Jewish-Brazilian identity M oacyr Scliar's fiction, shaped by a Jewish perspective of diaspora and immigration, is concerned with representing difference and cultural heterogeneity within Brazilian society (Vieira,Jewish Voices 159, 182). Specifically, his fiction stages the confrontation between individual, subjective experience and the external pressures of fitting into acceptable social models of "normalcy." O centauro no jardim (1983), one of Scliar's best-known novels, highlights the tensions involved in negotiating differences in constructing identities by invoking mythological terms and imbuing them with multiple meanings, ranging from the local to the general. The novel revives and reworks the classical figure of the centaur, who is here a Jewish- Brazilian centaur who attempts to negotiate and makes sense of his unusually "differ- ent" body. Drawing attention to Brazilian society's complex relationship with its "Oth- ers," the centaur signifies discordant and unclassifiable cultural "difference." On a national level, the centaur and the theme of anthropomorphosis-the quest of becom- ing human (i.e., "normal")-allegorically draw attention to the figurative dismember- ment that social and national pressures pro- duce on Brazilian society. At the same time, the centaur exposes and debunks modern myths of the integrated self and of the seam- less, "natural" body, and highlights the dy- namic processes of identity formation.1 0 centauro nojardim incorporates a split- narrative view that shuns chronological time and resembles a surrealistic reverie. The novel opens and closes at a Tunisian restaurant called "Jardim das Delicias," where Guedali Tartakovsky is celebrating his thirty-eighth birthday with family and friends. The occasion prompts his nostalgic musings, which constitute the narrative plot. Not unlike Hieronymus Bosch's fa- mous 1504 painting, whose title The Garden of Earthly Delights echoes in that of the novel, Scliar weaves together heteroge- neous imagery of human and animal forms to suggest a conflation of fantasy and real- ity that stretches the limits of conventional representations. The reader progressively patches together the biographical pieces, set between 1935 and 1973, which the pro- tagonist provides: the Tartakovsky family flees the Russian pogroms to move to what they believe will be a New World haven in Rio Grande do Sul, only to find themselves welcomed by Getlilio Vargas's dictatorship (1930-45). Shortly thereafter, Guedali is born: "...uma crianga normal, da cintura para cima. Da cintura para baixo: o pilo de cavalo. As patas de cavalo" (21). After the</page><page sequence="2">A CENTAUR IN THE TEXT: NEGOTIATING CULTURAL MULTIPLICITY IN MOACYR SCLIAR'S NOVEL 769 initial shock, Guedali's family accepts and loves him, but the centaur grows up shel- tered and acutely self-conscious of his anomalous body. During his early adult- hood, Guedali overcomes his solitude and self-estrangement when by chance he meets Tita, a half-Indian and half-European goy (non-Jewish) centauress. They marry, but the two grow weary of trotting about in the countryside and undergo the surgical removal of their equine parts in order to be able to relocate to Sdo Paulo without draw- ing attention to themselves. The operations are successful, and the couple adopts an increasingly bourgeois and assimilated lifestyle. Assimilation into affluence and "nor- malcy," however, does not elicit the ex- pected happiness and satisfaction in Guedali. In his post-surgery account, he periodically hears the rustling of a winged horse: "Volta e meia acordo ta noite com a sensagdo de ter ouvido um ruido estranho (o ruflar das asas do cavalo alado?). Mas e' impressdo. Tita, que tem ouvido excepcio- nalmente apurado, nio escutou nada: dorme tranqiiila" (12). A new lifestyle brings nostalgia for Guedali. The Pegasus- like winged horse he thinks he hears un- doubtedly represents a nostalgic idealiza- tion of what he was once was, coupled by the longing to reconnect with a transcen- dent higher self. Paradoxically, after achiev- ing his initial goal, he feels unfulfilled and stifled by convention. In their bourgeois restlessness, both Guedali and Tita have affairs. When temporarily separated, Guedali returns alone to Rio Grande do Sul. Once there, he suddenly wishes to recon- nect with his centaurness and to pray again: "Queria andar descalgo, queria criar calos nas solas dos pe's, para tornal-las cada vez mais grossas, cada vez mais semelhantes a cascos-cascos verdadeiros, enfim.... Sim, eu queria voltar a rezar" (207-08). It is here that he first hears the flutter of the winged horse and remembers that certain mystics held these fantastic horses to be the guard- ian angels of centaurs (215). Having lost his centaur self, he focuses on spirituality, in- voking and reinterpreting the Pegasus figure, which, in classical references, inhab- its the heavens and is in close proximity to the gods. At the point that the reader can fully sus- pend disbelief and accept the extraordinary quest of this latter-day centaur, the narra- tive is interrupted by a counter-version of events told from the point of view of Guedali's wife, Tita, who provides a surpris- ingly prosaic account of her husband's life. As she confides to her girlfriend, he was born with a birth defect: Guedali cresce na fazenda. E um menino quieto. Gosta de caminhar, apesar de um defeito de nascenga-tem um p6 levemente eqiiino, o que o obriga a usar sapa- tos ortop6dicos e ihe dificulta a deambulagCo. Em compensagdo, 6 excelente cavaleiro; 6 com desenvol- tura que galopa pelos campos. (227) According to Tita, Guedali's equine, "mal- formed" feet and his proclivity for horse- back riding make him centaur-like. The momentous transformational operation per- formed by the Moroccan doctor (who spe- cializes in transsexual operations in Guedali's version), and to which Guedali al- ludes extensively throughout the narrative, also appears now in a different light. Tita re- marks that Guedali developed a tumor that gave him hallucinations and made him think he was a centaur: Tem dores de cabega terriveis, acompanhadas de sen- saCbes estranhas. Parece-lhe que o corpo cresceu, que ficou enorme, e que a pele dos p6s se tornou grossa e dura: cascos. Apresenta distfirbios de conduta: levan- ta-se a noite, sai correndo pelo campo. Tita tem de ir busca-lo, ele ndo quer voltar para casa, diz que 6 um centauro. (232) At Tita's urging, Guedali enlists the profes- sional services of a Moroccan neurosur- geon, who, during the operation, removes a strange-shaped tumor (which Guedali- in his version-swears is a miniature ver- sion of a centaur). All references to their centaur life together and to her own surgi- cal transformation from centaur to human are disregarded in Tita's version. The temporal disjunction and narrative oscillation between Guedali's and Tita's ver- sions of events suggest that the novel itself is metaphorically a centaur-a conflation of irreconcilable points ofview. O centauro no</page><page sequence="3">770 HISPANIA 83 DECEMBER 2000 jardim uses the analogy of dual essences (man/beast), which the classical centaur ostensibly embodies, to stage the visible confrontation and negotiation of multidi- mensional cultural codes. Rather than reviv- ing the centaur's traditional connotations to prefigure mythological motifs, Scliar re- works the image so that it becomes a point of departure for exploring the cultural dis- comfort and tensions that cultural pluralism generates in Brazilian society. The centaur does not function as what John J. White terms a metaphor of imitation, whereby a mythological element serves to elicit narra- tive structural motifs from classical litera- ture (20-23); nor does it take on a pre- figurative function which parallels classical plots (11). Rather, the centaur is simply a figurative analogy that exploits the image of dual essences as a vehicle for exploring multiplicity. DiAntonio substantiates this view: "0 centauro no jardim radically de- parts from the 'mythical method' so popu- lar in modern fiction. The innovative struc- turing principle of this text resides in the fact that instead of the author, Scliar, super- imposing a mythic framework upon his plot or vice versa, he creates a narrator who mythologizes the events of his life" (DiAntonio 121). How the narrator mythologizes the events of his life is shaped by ethnic, local, and global preoccupations. The novel ex- ploits the "essential" dichotomy implicit in the image of the centaur to explore and de- stabilize other suggestive cultural pairings. On an ethnic level, Scliar highlights the ten- sions operating in Old World/ New World, Jewish/Brazilian, and immigrated/assimi- lated experiences. The migration from Rus- sia to rural Rio Grande do Sul and the atten- dant economic, temporal, and socio-cultural shifts, prefigure the complex pluralities that the young Guedali will have to face and embody. As Zili Bernd notes, the centaur captures the transition between locations and traditions: In Scliar, the dichotomy between belonging to the Americas and being of Jewish origin will engender the motif of the centaur, in permanent quest for identity.... The centaur, therefore, is the symbol both of the split (bipartition) between the spiritual and material being, and also of the cultural split between the cultural heri- tage of the Old World and the emergence of America's own particular (propre) culture. (23 [trans. from French mine]) In addition to capturing a bicultural eth- nic heritage, the centaur evokes a popular local myth of Rio Grande do Sul, since the "centaur of the pampas" is the poetic name for the gatcho or Brazilian cowboy. This image aptly represents the symbiotic rela- tionship that exists between a gautcho and his horse. In Brazil, people living in Rio Grande do Sul are also called gautchos, whether or not they raise cattle. This com- munity includes the large Jewish population that settled in Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul. In describing what it means to be a Jew- ish-Brazilian writer, Scliar emphasizes the creative and ethical impulses that arise from his own hybrid heritage: ...to my readers I am an enigma. Many Brazilians have stereotypes about Jews, so, for them my books come as a surprise: 'I never imagined that Jews could be like the characters you portray.' Nor did I. The characters I deal with are not real Jews (nor real Bra- zilians; or for that matter, real people...). They are a kind of hybrids. Centaurs. (By the way, gatichos, the people of Rio Grande do Sul where I was born, are called the 'centaurs of the pampas,' because they are cowboys, cattle-raisers). But in them I see the synthe- sis of two rich cultures, Jewish and Brazilian. Ningun and samba. Stories of the Bible and Indian legends. The ethical impulse of the Old Testament finds an appropriate object in the injustice that has so long vis- ited the poor of South America. (DiAntonio/Glickman 29) Scliar is himself a medical doctor who be- gan his literary career in 1962 and who has produced an impressive collection of fictional narratives that incorporate Jewish themes as points of departure for exploring cultural multiplicity in Brazil.2Through the perspective of a Russian-Jewish experience, a reality that has often been at the margins of Brazilian mainstream, Scliar's fiction highlights the nation's cultural complexi- ties. As both an "insider" and "outsider" in his native Brazil, he is able to observe and critique his heterogeneous society from various points of view.</page><page sequence="4">A CENTAUR IN THE TEXT: NEGOTIATING CULTURAL MULTIPLICITY IN MOACYR SCLIAR'S NOVEL 771 In O centauro no jardim, Scliar explores and juxtaposes other issues that move be- yond the strictly ethnic to the national arena. In a contemporary society intent on emulating a bourgeois aesthetic of "keeping up appearances" and subscribing to a capi- talist agenda, the centaur destabilizes norms of cultural consensus. Guedali's ad- ventures also reveal some of the salient Brazilian attitudes towards difference that are shaped by racial, economic, and re- gional pressures. Although Scliar's narra- tives have been cited to exemplify "ethnic fiction" and "Jewish writing" in present-day Brazil (DiAntonio 119), it is important to assess his work in all its complexity and to acknowledge the global issues his writing addresses. Not only does O centauro no jardim provide a cultural critique from a unique Jewish perspective, it also engages larger questions that interrogate the param- eters of representation, both aesthetic and political. What are the implications of hav- ing a "normal" human body? How is iden- tity formed or derived from the body? In what ways do homogenizing parameters take root in or on the body? The novel evokes these questions through Guedali's excessive and transgressive body. O centauro no jardim obliges the reader to become more attentive, to refrain from re- garding bodies as "natural" or transparently biological, and to regard them as both prod- ucts as well as producers of discourse. As Elizabeth Grosz argues, the body can only be understood as a historicized and cultur- ally specific phenomenon: the body, or rather, bodies, cannot be adequately un- derstood as ahistorical, precultural, or natural objects in any simple %iay; they are not only inscribed, marked, engraved by social pressures external to them but are the products, the direct effects of the very social constitution of nature itself. It is not sim- ply that the body is represented in a variety of ways according to historical, social, and cultural exigencies while it remains basically the same; these factors ac- tively produce the body as a body of a determinate type. (x) Both Grosz and Scliar draw attention to the relational quality of identity-formation as it registers on the body. As Guedali's corpo- ral adventures demonstrate, identity is not static or one-dimensional. Rather, it is a confluence of social pressures and indi- vidual drives, along with the dynamic pro- cesses through which these vie for expres- sion and articulation. The centaur is so clearly a transgression of "normalcy" that it underscores the com- plex dynamics that the body in general en- compasses: "[the body] is at the boundary between biology and society, between drives and discourse, between the sexual and its categorisation in terms of power, bi- ography and history" (Richard 65). The cen- taur body, then, becomes the gauge for dis- cerning Guedali's subjective experiences, his reactions to cultural differences and changes, and the collective reactions to him and his changing identity. The scene in which Guedali realizes he is "playing footsy" under the restaurant table, although he cannot determine with whom-his wife or her girlfriend-is a criti- cal moment in the novel, illustrating the dynamic and relational quality of identity discussed above: Neste momento estai me ocorrendo uma duivida: de quem sdo estes p6s nus, que sob a mesa acaricio com meus p6s tamb6m descalhos? Tanto podem ser de Tita como da mona. A expressio dos rostos nao me ajuda a solucionar o enigma: ambas sorriem com ar cfimplice.... Hai pessoas com p6s bizarros, hai mesmo os cascos dos centauros, mas p6s com o deddo para fora, isto nio existe: um p6 6 de uma, outro p6 de outra. (244) This humorous moment of ambiguity en- capsulates the narrative tension that frames the novel. It combines the various perspec- tives that have given "shape" to the protagonist's centaurness through the ironic image of the "oddly shaped feet," which Guedali does not immediately recog- nize as unusual (no doubt because of his own "relaxed" parameters of corporal nor- malcy). Realizing that these two feet (both with the big toe on the outside) do not be- long to the same person, he is filled with glee, bursting into an attack of laughter. This titillating realization revitalizes his spirit, shaken by Tita's soap-opera-like ex-</page><page sequence="5">772 HISPANIA 83 DECEMBER 2000 posure of his humdrum life, to the point that he invokes the image of the winged horse and gets up, apparently ready to take off in a galloping flight. This scene is symbolic of the multiple layers of meaning that are hybridized throughout the novel. Each of the women represents one of the two general perspec- tives that shape the novel: Tita embodies the prosaic and verisimilar interpretation of Guedali's life-the one privileged by the "outside world" for its apparent objective- ness. Her aspirations are typically bour- geois, striving for consensus, perfection, and material success, inspired by the telenovelas to which she is addicted. In con- trast, Tita's girlfriend represents the erotic energy that fuels Guedali's centaur libido and fantasy world. The charm necklaces dangling from her neck suggest that per- haps both she and the miniature gold sym- bols, which include a "Star of David," "little Indians," "a sphinx," "a horse with out- spread wings," and "a centaur," prompted Guedali's preceding autobiographical rev- erie, culminating in a circular narration. The image of the four feet touching un- der the restaurant table represents the con- juncture of the verisimilar and the fantastic perspectives symbolized by each women. Guedali literally has "one foot in each world." However, the image also incorpo- rates the multiple significations of Guedali's own feet, themselves highly charged signifiers. Guedali's sense ofbody-his fan- tasy, eroticism, "handicap" and medical "problems"-, the external perception of his "difference," and the pressure of bourgeois versions of normalcy converge and give his body multidimensional meanings. Throughout the novel, Guedali's feet are alternately represented as congenitally "de- formed," as hooves, as covered by boots, and finally, when the hooves split apart, as "small and delicate" (167). Each of these images functions as a synecdoche for the specific corporal significations that inform Guedali's body throughout the narrative and give shape to his subjectivity. His body, then, is to be read not as a fixed metaphor but rather as a changing articulation, based on the discourses with which he is "playing footsy" at a given moment. Tita's disclosure that Guedali was born with a congenital impairment of the foot provides one example of a "podiatric evoca- tion" which layers an appreciation of Guedali's bodily manifestations. In addition to being Jewish in a predominantly Catho- lic country, he is also marked by the stigma of physical "deformity," so Guedali may be attempting to sublimate a physical disabil- ity. Tita's account leads readers to view the centaur as an imagined body with which Guedali identifies in order to symbolically conceal and accommodate a sense of infe- riority caused by his "handicap" and his being Jewish. The centaur body, in this case, wavers between an imagined mytholo- gized body and a physiologically "imper- fect" one-a reaction to the idealized Bra- zilian body, which establishes the "norm." The narrative emphasis on the stigmatized body becomes a critical gesture that implic- itly exposes the "perfect," "normal" socio- cultural body for theoretical scrutiny. Whether represented as a metaphor or simile, Guedali's feet are said to be hooves, or "like" horse's hooves. On the one hand, this figurative representation points to his inherent corporal "difference" and hints at the protagonist's carnal excesses. Fre- quently described as having a highly charged libido, Guedali is in this regard most classically a centaur in that his sexual appetite evokes the Thessalian centaurs, who were notoriously licentious. In one of the novel's most memorable scenes, Guedali, who has found his calling in "dress- ing up" as a centaur for a local circus act, pounces on the lion tamer, overcome by desire. His unbridled passion (pun in- tended) causes her to scream in panic: E entdo-avalancha descendo a montanha, torrente rompendo as comportas-atiro-me sobre ela e jAi n?o vejo mais nada. Confusamente percebo que grita por socorro-me acudam, ele esti me atacando, 6 um monstro-subjugo-a, tapo-lhe a boca, tento penetrar, nao consigo, ejaculo-lhe as coxas, tombo para o lado exausto. Ela pula da cama e foge gritando sempre: 6 um cavalo! Um cavalo de verdade! (79-80) Ironically, it is when Guedali plays the part</page><page sequence="6">A CENTAUR IN THE TEXT: NEGOTIATING CULTURAL MULTIPLICITY IN MOACYR SCLIAR'S NOVEL 773 of a human who is playing the part of a cen- taur-supposedly in costume for the circus show-that he most resembles the classi- cal, wanton centaur. In this environment of "freaks" he becomes the most "monstrous" of all on account of his uncontrolled sexual passion; and, as this scene suggests, it is his hooves which give his "nature" away-" [e] um cavalo de verdade!" Guedali's hooves also, more generally, evoke a corporal mark of difference which resonates with certain bodily stereotypes of Jews. Guedali's hooves/feet undoubtedly insert themselves emblematically within a cultural continuum that marks the Jew as inherently "different." Sander Gilman in '"The Jewish Nose: Are Jews White? Or, The History of the Nose Job" traces a history of physiognomic, caricature-like representa- tions of the Jewish male. He notes that, es- pecially during the nineteenth century, "pathological" signs of the Jew's difference rested on the size of his nose, sexual or- gans, and in certain cases, feet-all of which were taken as signs of moral and sexual depravity (169). Guedali's purportedly huge sexual organ, as well as his hooves, invert and hyperbolize these sorts of cultural cari- catures, underscoring their absurdity. Because their hooves are such a great source of humiliation on account of their visible anomalousness, both Tita and Guedali, after their operations, rely heavily on their custom-made boots to "pass" as normal. The boots play an important role in adding significance to the various corporal configurations in the text. On the one hand, they literally allow them to walk, for with- out them, they lose their balance and are forced to crawl. On the other hand, they function as Tita's and Guedali's "uniform," covering up their difference while simulta- neously signaling a latent oddness. The couple's friends cannot understand why, for example, Tita and Guedali never go to the beach or to swimming pools (127). The couple's donning of boots is closely associated with Tita and Guedali's move from the countryside in Rio Grande do Sul to the city of Sho Paulo and to Guedali's becoming initiated into the city's burgeon- ing business world. The boots function as a bridge from the centaur world to the hu- man world and also participate in a symbolic trajectory from the country to the city, from Rio Grande do Sul to Sao Paulo, from a ru- ral existence to an economically comfort- able bourgeois lifestyle. They thus evoke a regional memory, as they are closely linked to the hooves that are vestiges of the couple's centaur years in Rio Grande do Sul. However, they also connote images from Brazilian history. For example, Scliar ap- pears quite deliberately to set Guedali's birth in the year 1935, during Gettilio Vargas's fascist dictatorship. Vargas, as well as some of the subsequent military dicta- tors, were originally from Rio Grande do Sul. In a figurative sense, while the boots can be read as an essential accoutrement of the bomabacha-wearing gauchos of the re- gion, they also bear a strong military con- notation-i.e., the image of the military on horseback. At the same time that the boots provide Tita and Guedali with greater mo- bility and social acceptability, they have authoritarian and constraining effects on their hooves/feet: Acima da mesa, Guedali e Tita eram os clientes de um simpaitico restaurante; conversavam e eram atendidos pelo amaivel gargom. Abaixo, eram as patas que co- mandavam, patas inquietas, doidas para galopar, nem que fosse no paitio doJardim das Delicias, mas tendo de se restringir ao escasso metro quadrado que ihes era concedido no momento. (125) The boots are obliquely evocative of the repressive, homogenizing regime of the 1960s and 1970s in which civilians were forced to keep up the appearance of social tranquility while being subjected to censor- ship and other restrictive measures. On yet another level, the boots, in addi- tion to allowing Guedali to enter Sdo Paulo society undetected, also allow him to broach the business world and participate in the city's economic prosperity: "Reinava grande euforia nos meios comerciais e industriais quando a eles cheguei. A economia estava hiperaquecida; 6 verdade que a inflaCio era galopante, mas-nio posso resistir i imagem-isso nio era problema para quem tinha cascos" (121).</page><page sequence="7">774 HISPANIA 83 DECEMBER 2000 This quote appears in a section that coin- cides with the chapter entitled "Sdo Paulo: 25 de setembro de 1960 a 15 de julho de 1968," dates which correspond to Brazil's aggressive program of industrialization and export. In this economic setting, the boots become reminiscent of the shoe export in- dustry- also associated with the Rio Grande do Sul area-which continues to thrive today. When Guedali's hooves finally crack open, they reveal small, delicate feet that suggest full, permanent assimilation into middle-class Paulista society. This highly understated event occurs within the con- fines of the Condominio Horizontal-an affluent housing compound built by Guedali and several Jewish-Brazilian friends in an at- tempt to reactivate Baron Hirsch's commu- nal legacy. However, in practice, the Condominio Horizontal is a far cry from the Baron's Marxist leanings. In this scenario, the delicate feet become emblematic of the rarefied and rather decadent affluent lifestyle of the inhabitants, who resemble the leisure-oriented protagonists of the telenovelas. Guedali's assimilation is contin- gent upon his "normalcy," which translates as corporal anonymity-a devaluing of sin- gularity for sameness. The oscillation of points of view and the multiple corporal signifiers discussed above evoke the protagonist's uneasy and ambiva- lent relationship with the external percep- tion of his difference and his internalized sense of self as Other. Even as Guedali be- comes a successful, fully assimilated busi- nessman (external perception), his narra- tive continues to express a sense of his own difference within Brazilian society. Accord- ing to Guedali, the winged horse still visits him, which suggests that even if his body has been "normalized," his centaur "spirit" remains intact. The post-operation scenes reveal that his "centaurness" is as much a function of how others react to him in the world as of how he views himself. The two perspectives are inextricably linked. The image of the centaur-shaped tumor reinforces this linkage. The operation, to which both Tita and Guedali allude, be- comes the focal point of Guedali's transfor- mation. Guedali is subjected to a procedure that will either make him physically or men- tally "normal," or both. In Guedali's initial account, the surgery allows him to achieve physical human normalcy through the re- moval of his equine parts. Tita's version, however, suggests that Guedali's problem is mental, rather than physical. For Tita, the "operation" refers to the moment in which a neurosurgeon removes the tumor that is prompting Guedali's centaur hallucinations. Even as he momentarily acknowledges Tita's version, Guedali defiantly adds that the tumor is shaped like a centaur: Tumor. Interessante. Tumor, como gerar um: imagi- ne um centauro.... Esta figura, imaginaria, gera natu- ralmente uma tremenda energia-ainda que imaginilria.... Logo teris um n6dulo, o n6dulo cres- ce, emite apendices a maneira de patas, de tronco, de bravos, de cabepa-e pronto, eis formado no interior mesmo da massa cerebral o modelo miniatural de um centauro.... (233) The insistence that the centaur is a physi- cal, cellular entity inside his brain suggests that Guedali's lived interiority and projected exteriority are blurred and conjoined. The image of the centaur-shaped tumor inside the centaur who, in turn, is living an anthro- pomorphic existence upsets all attempts to draw distinctions between interior (mental) and exterior (corporal) models of reality. This blurring of inside/outside, mental/ corporal, fantasy/reality represents the in- ternalized displacement experienced by a marginalized character attempting to "fit in." This figurative representation of the in- ternalized centaur resonates with the cul- tural phenomenon that Nelson Vieira terms the "outsider within."3 This term refers to the complex multipositionalities that many Latin American Jews experience and cap- tures the contradictory tensions faced by socio-economically "assimilated" Jews. In many cases, their "external" appearance is that of having achieved financial success, while simultaneously they may maintain a sense of alterity rooted in their histories, memories, and experiences of diaspora. In this regard, the centaur tumor, and later the</page><page sequence="8">A CENTAUR IN THE TEXT: NEGOTIATING CULTURAL MULTIPLICITY IN MOACYR SCLIAR'S NOVEL 775 Pegasus winged horse, symbolize the idea that Guedali's sense of difference and "oth- erness" is inscribed in his psyche. 0 centauro no jardim features the protagonist's personal quest, at the same time that it underscores the social pres- sures that all individuals undergo to be- come "shaped" into bodies of specific types. In this regard, the novel focuses on a col- lective process as well. That the narrative evokes a national trajectory and exploration is strongly conveyed at the opening of the novel when the reader catches glimpses of Guedali's parents in the "Old World." Guedali, laying the foundation for the nar- ration of his own birth, remembers his father's graphic account of surviving a bloody Russian pogrom and of witnessing "a rua principal cheia de cadaiveres mutilados e as casas transformadas em ruinas fumegantes" (25). This image of ter- rorization and mutilation is linked to a loca- tion (Russia) and to an official anti-Semitic policy of the State. Brazil, to which the Tartakovsky family escapes, is presented a priori as a utopic "haven." As Leonardo Senkman notes: It is not surprising that it was Jews who pioneered the American Utopia; this space-other, refuge, and land of asylum for Europe's persecuted, America became terram utopicam in the imagination of Jewish emi- grants who dreamed of finding a new possibility, a novum latent in the reality of another place. (33) The aforementioned fact that the birth of the half-human, half-horse protagonist oc- curs in 1935, coinciding with Getfilio Vargas's Estado Novo, is ironic. How will this anomaly fare during this political period of quasi-fascist popular suppression, active nationalism, and political and economic cen- tralization of government?4 Indeed, the im- agery of mutilation introduced in the scene with the Russian pogroms will continue to be invoked in the representation of Brazil under a dictatorship. Although operating in a more figurative register, the thematic thread of mutilation suggests that the State's assimilationist pressures produce less overt but highly problematic "dismem- bering" effects. O centauro no jardim inti- mates that Guedali's anthropomorphic or- deal is only one example, among many, of the sloughing off of differences that occurs in a homogenizing nationalist Brazil. In light of the Tartakovsky family's fears regarding the anomalous appearance of their newborn son, the midwife reassures them that Guedali is not alone. She has wit- nessed other strange cases of hybrid births: "Tambem ela jai viu casos estranhos: uma crianpa que criou escamas de peixe, outra na qual nasceu um rabo-dez centimetros, se tanto, mas rabo, indiscutivelmente rabo" (26). Her account foreshadows the exist- ence of other singular beings whom Guedali will encounter later in life. When Guedali meets Tita, the half-Indian and half-European centauress, their shared destiny seems inevitable, as they become each other's longed-for mate. As the reader follows their trajectory through anthropo- morphosis and subsequent relocation to Sao Paulo, the Tartakovsky couple appear to be the only Brazilian citizens faced with the peculiar predicament of having been born of a different species. It is only after their total assimilation, when they have settled in the Condominio Horizontal, that the extent of Brazil's ambiance of differ- ences becomes apparent. The midwife's earlier disclosure is confirmed, when, in an intimate moment of drunkenness with his urban Jewish friends, Guedali, much to his surprise, discovers that they, too, are "closet" hybrids: Eu tambem nasci com um defeito, disse Jillio, de repente. Eu tinha um rabo, pequeno-vinte centime- tros, se tanto-mas peludo, rabo de macaco. Meus pais ficaram horrorizados. Mas, o mohel, quando me fez a circuncisio, aproveitou e cortou tambem aquela coisa. -E eu? disse Joel. -Eu, que nasci cheio de esca- ma, como se fosse um peixe. (165) Despite the appearances of "normalcy" and inconspicuousness, Guedali and his friends all evoke a memory of corporal dif- ference, suggesting that the mainstream, outwardly homogeneous city surges with a pluralism which, in a sense, has been trun- cated or camouflaged by apparently "nor- mal" bodies. Although humorous, these confessions to Guedali reinforce the image</page><page sequence="9">776 HISPANIA 83 DECEMBER 2000 of mutilation, for as the friends relate, their anomalies, like Guedali's, are "fixed" or "normalized" with a scalpel. This exchange strongly evokes the earlier scene in which the centaur-Guedali is subjected to the an- thropomorphic operation in Morocco, for, like his friends, he has his offending ap- pendages removed. Guedali's discarded body parts provide a more focused glimpse of the significance of what has been "cut off," or figuratively forgotten, in producing Guedali's more homogenous Brazilian body. When the post-operation protagonist in- quires about his equine remains, the doc- tor provides an alarming and unexpected answer: Primeiro respondeu que tinha mandado jogar tudo- patas, cauda, couro, visceras-ao mar; depois se con- tradisse: ndo, ndo tinha mandado jogar os restos ao mar, mandara queimai-los. Acabou confessando que vendera os despojos aos nativos. Carne de cavalo aqui e disputada, disse, e voce estava bem nutrido. Aliais, continuou, do cavalo os nativos aproveitam tudo: do couro fazem tambores para as danpas rituais; dos ossos tiram adubo; com os cascos fazem cinzeiros e outros objetos de artesana- to; com a cauda confeccionam uma especie de espan- ta-moscas para os altos dignitairios. Espero que voce ndo se importe, acrescentou. NMo, murmurei, ndo me importo. (106) The doctor's bizarre disclosure inserts, for the first time, an image of an "African" Other. The incongruous, racist representa- tions of the African natives are somewhat startling, considering the large Brazilian population of African descent. However, these surrealistic and grossly caricatur- esque images of a "savage Africa" reinforce the overall absence of more accurate repre- sentations of persons of African descent or of indigenous "natives" within the Brazil that is depicted in Guedali's account. This enigmatic scenario suggests that, despite the protagonist's struggle to come to terms with his difference and society's discrimina- tory reaction to it, he nevertheless is an ac- complice in propagating stereotypes of ra- cial Others. The fact that he hears the syn- copation of the "natives" drumming at night and imagines their pounding on his stretched-out hide (107) confirms his deep- rooted apprehension of these "uncivilized people." Perhaps the most insidious culturally produced mutilating effect represented in 0 centauro no jardim is the circulation of ste- reotypes of Others (i.e., women, Indians, etc.) in which Guedali also participates. While Guedali is keenly aware of his own difference and the stereotypes directed at him, he is not immune from indulging his own prejudices, extensions of the cliches and stereotypes cultivated by his socio-cul- tural environment. On the one hand, he seems acutely aware of the racial, cultural, or physical differences in the others. For example, he takes an interest in his friends' account of their retarded daughter, be- comes fascinated by the farmhand Peri's Indian "secrets" and seemingly feels an empathetic attraction for the Sphinx he meets on his second trip to Africa. What becomes clear, however, is that he is usu- ally oblivious or unwilling to scrutinize his own stereotyped projections: his farmhand's name, for example, is Remiao, but Guedali chooses to call him Peri, the name of the quintessential "Indian" in Jose de Alencar's nineteenth-century romantic novel, O guarani. His relationship with the Sphinx can be read as a machista exotifica- tion of a Tunisian woman who becomes a specular image for his self-aggrandized sense of sexual prowess. And, finally, the edginess he describes feeling in the Tunision restaurant Jardim das Delicias can be explained, in part, as his mistrust of the Arab waiters: "Essa gente... [i] rritam-se por pouco, e sao vingativos.. ." (13). Guedali most blatantly discloses his prejudices when, contemplating the possi- bility of becoming the father of a monstrous baby, he imagines the worst-case scenario, and concludes that he would be capable of embracing millions of Others: ...ficava subitamente comovido e me sentia, como Schiller, capaz de abragar milh6es. Milhaes, incluin- do ai pelo menos umas dezenas de negros, de indios, de terroristas palestinos, de seres disformes diversos (ciclope com catarata no olho tinico, o caapora com suas pernas voltadas para tris e les6es de p6-de-atle-</page><page sequence="10">A CENTAUR IN THE TEXT: NEGOTIATING CULTURAL MULTIPLICITY IN MOACYR SCLIAR'S NOVEL 777 ta entre os dedos, sem falar nos corcundas e nos de cara queimada de aicido)-e um centaurinho, que fos- se. Sim, eu era capaz de amar ate um centaurinho.... (138) This enumeration of a "few dozen" Blacks, Indians, and Palestinian "terrorists" in con- junction with grotesquely deformed fantastical beings suggests a grouping of society's unwanted and of Guedali's own phantasms. While highly ironic and humor- ous, this scene makes it clear that Guedali is not a romanticized or "noble" marginal figure. Rather, the narrative presents a com- plex character who is discriminated against by his society but nevertheless participates in and perpetuates Brazilian society's covert facilitation of prejudiced stereotyping. Guedali's declaration suggests an impasse of articulation-one that reduces corporal singularity of any sort to hyperbole, strange- ness, or myth. In a novel that highlights the themes of mutilation and dismemberment, this representational distortion of difference points to a more covert though highly insidi- ous case of dismemberment that is founded on the reductive misrepresentation of Oth- ers. By introducing a disconcerting image of difference-the centaur-Scliar urges the reader to become more aware of represen- tations of alterity and the inextricably re- lated issue of stereotyping and its disturb- ing effects. Guedali's perceptual disjunc- tures, of both his own difference and that of others, dissuades the reader from attempt- ing any ethnocentric or essentializing read- ings of his difference, whether it be re- garded as his being Jewish, being a centaur, having a disability, or all of these. His cen- taur body functions as a transgressive signifier that draws attention to the repre- sentational limits of cultural consensus. Guedali is a figure of difference par excel- lence: whether it be within Brazilian society at large, within his family and Jewish com- munity, or within the gazicho region of Rio Grande do Sul, he is a misfit. As Thomson notes, the "extraordinary" body always sig- nals other meanings: Never simply itself, the exceptional body betokens something else, becomes revelatory, sustains narra- tive, exists socially in a realm of hyper-representation. Indeed the word monster-perhaps the earliest and most enduring names for the singular body-derives from the Latin monstra, meaning to warn, show, or sign, and which has given us the modern verb dem- onstrate. (3) Guedali's unusual body highlights and un- dermines social expectations. As Nelson Vieira notes, "perceiving incongruities within ethnic, racial, and national groups can help society dismantle and reverse those stereotypical myths that focus upon the 'norm"' (Jewish Voices 169). While 0 centauro nojardim is outwardly humorous and fanciful, the narrative simul- taneously incorporates a serious urgency to highlight and problematize the representa- tion of cultural heterogeneity in Brazil. Guedali's changing body illustrates the dy- namic process of identity formation. It draws attention to the various cultural forces that give shape, meaning, and value to individual bodies. In other words, history, fantasy, eroticism, economic ambition, dis- crimination, and "official ideology," among other points of view, intervene to modulate the protagonist's body. In focusing on the more damaging "cuts" or "dismembering" effects of some of these discourses, particu- larly those inflected by assimilationist pres- sures, the text makes an implicit appeal for a reformulation of representational lan- guage that is made stagnant by closed and fixed stereotypes. he unresolved circular ending pro- vides a continued meditation on the urgencies discussed above. In the novel's final sentence, Guedali seems to have overcome his longing for his lost cen- taur body. Hearing the winged horse once again, he appears to submit to a flight of fancy that will lead him to total freedom: "Como um cavalo alado, prestes a algar v6o, rumo i montanha do riso eterno, o seio de Abraio. Como um cavalo, na ponta dos cascos, pronto a galopar pelo pampa. Como um centauro no jardim, pronto a pular o muro, em busca da liberdade" (245). Just as Bosch's enigmatic triptych combines a va- riety of subjects and unorthodox imagery to</page><page sequence="11">778 HISPANIA 83 DECEMBER 2000 break with the norms of his times, the novel's "Jardim das delicias" offers a simi- lar break, or "leap" from convention. It stages a personal iconography of Guedali's multiple identities that range from the ma- terial to the spiritual, and invites the reader to interpret the protagonist's personal sym- bolism on its own terms. Moacyr Scliar's centaur in the garden spurs the reader to- wards a continued exploration of the mul- tiple ingredients that formulate individual identities: history, memory, desire, location, difference, and the somatic language of rep- resentation. * NOTES 1By "modern myths" I mean certain Enlighten- ment ideas, captured in Descartes's famous pro- nouncement "I think, therefore, I am," which presuppose the individual subject's transcendence over matter and creates the dualistic division between empiricism and materialism. In more recent times, the works of Michel Foucault, among others, destabilize Enlightenment assumptions to show that the indi- vidual is subjected to a complex web of power struc- tures which establish parameters of "normalcy," and which "shape" his/her social existence in various ways. In this vein, Elizabeth Grosz says that, "far from being an inert, passive, noncultural and ahistorical term, the body may be seen as the crucial term, the site of contestation, in a series of economic, political, sexual, and intellectual struggles" (19). 2Works of this type include O carnaval dos animais (1968), a collection of short stories that foreshadows O centauro no jardim in that animal and human char- acters are juxtaposed to convey a cross-species plu- ralism that defies conventional social barriers. Os deuses de Raquel (1980) and A estranha nagdo de Rafael Mendes (1983) address the struggles and often nega- tive effects of cultural assimilation. Cenas da vida mintiscula (1991) is an allegorical tale narrated from the point of view of a ten-centimeter Jewish narrator who proposes a national reading of Brazil from the point of view of smallness. 3Nelson Vieira writes, "one can envisage the in- sider-outsider phenomenon as both a dilemma and a reflection of a basic paradox inherent in the general experience of many Latin American Jews-the gap between their success in socioeconomic terms and their relative political and ideological marginality" (Jewish Voices 12). 40One might add that it is during Vargas's Estado Novo, specifically from 1937 to 1939 that Jewish im- migration was officially restricted due to the State's official anti-Semitic refugee policy (Vieira, Jewish Voices 9). 0 WORKS CITED Alencar, Jose de.
