<plain_text><page sequence="1">Analecta et Additamenta The Capakobam of Sonora, Mexico. - Under the title "Mayo Ritual Impersonation: The Mask, Arousal, and Enculturation" (Anthropos 1968/69) N. Ross Crumrine des- cribes the behaviour of a group of ritual impersonators, the Capakobam, belonging to the Mayos of Mexico and members of a sodality called the Pariserom, who put up a scenic representation of the death of Christ in the course of a procession taking place during Lent. The author begins by rejecting as unsatisfactory the traditional functional interpretation, whereby the masked figures owe their origin to an error of cognition, or are intended to provide comic relief or supernatural sanctions. His final conclusion, however, is not only functionalist itself, but even more unsatisfactory than those it is supposed to replace. Relying on recent observations of cerebral action, he contends that the ambiguity to which these figures give rise aims at conveying a clearer and better- focussed view of reality by stimulating more intense mental activity. This interpretation, which ascribes to society a rather curious capacity for pedagogical planning to meet anticipated requirements and develop the higher faculties of its members by the customs it introduces, we shall deliberately set aside. Such functionalist interpretations of social phenomena leave them unexplained and, to justify their presence, attribute to them a given role chosen at random, which, however, acts more like a screen allowing only one of their aspects to filter through and become visible. Thus, the function ascribed to the impersonator of arousing laughter and relieving tension brings to view only the comical side of his character. If attention is directed to the sanctions involved, it is the fearful aspects he presents that come to the fore. Crumrine's interpretation centres on the am- biguous nature of the impersonator, but the latter' s fearful, comical or ambiguous aspects turn out simply to be different facets of that complex figure known as the ritual clown, met with in various ethnological areas, as Crumrine apparently seems to be unaware of. If, however, the functionalist interpretation, with all its ambiguities, is laid aside, a causal explanation of the problem of the ritual clown becomes possible in accord with scientific norms. Judicious use of the comparative method should bring out the con- stituent elements of that character, and reveal its identity with another figure, mythical this time, namely the trickster. Insofar as the trickster, appearing in myth, has been described in terms of practice and belief, the clown appears as his ritual counterpart: as the personification of the magical violator of taboo and, more particularly, of the transgressor acting for the benefit of the group (cf. Makarius 1970; 1969a). The function of the clown is thus seen to fit his character: it is his function to violate taboos and repeat the practice in its traditional revival in ceremonial. This func- tion transpires through each of his actions, through his appearance, his accoutrement, all the paraphernalia attached to his person, his activities, his recognized qualities and the various customs that accompany his presence. Viewed in this light, the Capakobam Mayo's behaviour becomes understandable. Because their ritual function is to violate taboos, they simulate copulation and the pains of childbirth before the altar, in church and under the gaze of children. They profanate, by "defecation", sacred objects, tease the public with the bodies of dead animals, and endulge in obscene behaviour, displaying phallic symbols, etc. "They know no shame." Again, it is for the same reason that they are associated with witchcraft (which we have shown as stemming from the violation of taboos), and backward behaviour ("crossing</page><page sequence="2">596 Analecta et Additamenta Anthropos 67. 1972 oneself with the left hand", etc.). The taboo more frequently transgressed by ritual clowns is the blood taboo. Crumrine does not mention any blood-letting in his text, but avers elsewhere that in the rite described, "Christ blood is an important part of his sacrifice" (Crumrine 1970: 72). Strips of red paint symbolising the blood of Christ are placed on their legs (73). The theory that trickster and clown are respectively the mythical and ritual pro- tagonists of the violation of taboo accounts for the more puzzling aspects of the behaviour of the Capakobam (now assimilated to Christian tradition) and should serve to solve the apparently insoluble contradiction that the latter represent the persecutors of Christ and achieve a kind of identification with his person. "They are expected to work hard, to sweat under their masks, and to suffer like Christ did during the last days of his life" (Crumrine 1968-69). It is as violators of taboo, and therefore as profanators of beings and things deemed sacred, that clowns are placed in opposition to what is holy, and are shown to persecute the divinity. On the other hand, they partake of the nature of Christ and share his inner characteristics: as breakers of taboos for the benefit of the group, clowns take upon themselves to atone for the guilt of others. They appear at once as sacrilegious and redeemers. Another puzzling contradiction is also solved on the same theory. These figures, as the physical embodiment of disrespect, disobedience and indiscipline, also act some- times as strict disciplinarians. The Pariserom may have the task of enforcing order and proper behaviour during the procession. They are called "The Protectors of Custom". Through the magical force they wield by virtue of their violation of taboo, they are all-powerful and eminently fitted to discharge police duties. Of the Koshari, Sia clowns, it is stated that they can make people do anything. "You can't disobey them." They can undress people in public and punish them for misbehaviour. They enforce discipline and are the guardians of law and order (cf. White 1962 : 166 ; Makarius 19696 : 634, 630) . In anthropology, it is always possible to work out a theoretical explanation for any set of facts ; but the final proof of an explanation is obtained when the facts explained are viewed in their rightful context, and contradictory situations are accounted for. The interpretation here proposed meets, we think, these requirements. Once the inadequacy of so-called functionalist interpretations, which take the effects of a phenomenon for its causes, becomes manifest, their validity becomes open to doubt, since they ascribe to society the capacity to enforce customary practices by wilful design, and a finality of clearly anthropomorphic character. The interpretation of Capakobam in terms of its causes likewise shows the futility of structural analysis, lumping together facts not yet understood ; recourse to this method of analysis merely empties the facts observed of their significance, without shedding any light on their nature. From an anthropological point of view, it would be more paying to follow up systematically the study of Capakobam and other Mayo sodalities mentioned by the author (for example, do the rabbit hunter-healers form one such?) and the activ- ities of these groups of clowns in recent years.
