Parr had been married and widowed twice before, but had no track record of producing children. Henry's own health was poor when they marriedâ€”and erectile dysfunction was likely. However, if there had been any questions posed about the apparent infertility, the perfect answer was available: the queen bore no children in her two previous marriages so it could not be the fault of the king (Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care 2012;38:200-1, doi:10,1136/jfprhc-2012-100399). Salvaging blood during radical pelvic urological surgery has been recommended practice for overthreeyears in the United Kingdom. An analysis of 213 cases of radical cystectomy over 10 years found that 91% of patients received intraoperative cell salvage (ICS) blood and 28% avoided any furthertransfusions. Towards the end of the decade, ICS blood provided 70% of overall transfusion requirements, thus reducing the risks associated with allogeneic red cell transfusions. Ongoing follow-up showed no apparent reduction in survival in oncology cases with ICS {British Journal of Urology International 2012, doi:10.1111/j. lA64-410X.2012.il 338.x). Adults in hospital care are weighed and measured by different methods, some of which are imprecise and biased. An Australian study compared two commonly adopted methods that use height, arm, waist, and hip circumferences to estimate weight, with visual estimates of weight obtained by two pharmacy interns. The results showed that estimation of body weight by anthropomorphic measures is not accurate, and makes drug dosing by weight potentially dangerous. Immobile and unconscious patients require accurate weighing equipment (Quarterly Journal of Medicine 2012;105:769-74, doi:10.1093/qjmed/hsc060). How does intrauterine exposure to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) affect pregnancy outcome? Overall, in an analysis of 153 cases, 52% ofnewborns exposed to ACEIs and 13% of those exposed to ARBs showed no complications (P&lt;0.001). Complications after exposure included renal failure, oligohydramnios, death, arterial hypotension, intrauterine growth retardation, respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary hypoplasia, A36yearold heterosexual man presented to the clinic with an ulcer on his penis, after having caught it in the zip of his trousers three weeks previously. He had been prescribed clotrimazole and flucloxacillin by his general practitioner, who had advised him to attend the genitourinary medicine department as the ulcer persisted. Examination showed two small lymph nodes in each groin and two small areas of hard skin on the palm of his left hand. Dark ground microscopy was negative but syphilis serology was positive, with a pattern consistent with early syphilis. The ulcer resolved on treatment.

The researchers suggest a "fetal renin-angiotensin system blockade syndrome" to describe these related findings (Hypertension 2012;60:444-50, doi:10.1161/hypertensionaha.112.196352). People with extrahepatic metastases (EHM) after hepatectomy and liver cancer have a poor prognosis. To develop a practical method for predicting postoperative extrahepatic metastases, researchers enrolled 578 patients and applied multivariate analysis to identify independent risk factors. The three factors were microvascularinvasion, incomplete capsule, and larger tumour diameter. The system was validated with a sensitivity of over 90% and a specificity greater than 60% {The 0/7co/o&lt;j/'sf 2012;17:963-9, doi:0.1634/ theoncologist.2011-0447). Women who choose unknown egg donation say it helps them feel secure in their role as a mother, and they want to avoid potential intrusions into family relationships. Others choose the "not knowing" stance because it distances them from the emotional impact of needing a donor. A small qualitative study found a tendency to idealise orfearthe donorwomen, although curiosity about the donor increased once a real baby existed, and the job of telling the child became more dauntingwhen little was known (Human Reproduction 2012;27:2067-75, doi:10.1093/ humrep/desll6). A 35 year old man presented with symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis. An ultrasound scan was requested, which did not visualise the appendix, but showed otherwise normal results. He failed to settle so the surgeons proceeded to appendicectomy, but found a normal appendix. The patient left believing he had had appendicitis, yet he had further episodes of pain. Eventually a Meckel's diverticulum was found, requiring more surgery. The patient made a claim against the surgeons, which may have been avoided had he been told he did not have appendicitis (www.medicalprotection.org/ caribbean-and-bermuda/case-reports-may 2012/a-normal-appendix). Daylight mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a good treatment for actinic keratoses (AKs). In a randomised study, 145 patients with 2768 AKs of the face and scalp were allocated to two exposure groups and then exposed themselves to daylight straight afterwards according to randomisation. No differences were found between the two groups. PDT for moderate to thick AKs was less effective than forthin AKs, but nearly all the thicker lesions were reduced to a lower lesion grade at three months after a single treatment (British Journal of Dermatology 2012;166:1327-32, doi:10.1111/j. 1365 2133.2012.10833.x). More than 540 patients with stroke who received tissue plasminogen activator were evaluated, with details noted about warfarin treatment before the stroke. Those patients taking warfarin up to the day of admission or the day before had an approximately fourfold risk for intracranial bleeding. The data suggest a significant and clinically meaningful increase in the risk for symptomatic bleeding among patients with stroke thrombolysis receiving warfarin untiljust before the stroke (Neurology 2012;79:31-8, doi:10.1212/wnl.0b013e31825dcdf0).
