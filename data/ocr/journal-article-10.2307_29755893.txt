<plain_text><page sequence="1">Syncretic Icons in Uttar Pradesh by Sheo Bahadur Singh Rivalries between the various sects often led to ill-feeling and bitterness and encour? aged the fabrication of mythological stories, which are occasionally reflected in iconography. This tendency was, however, arrested by the liberal leaders of religious thought from early times (x) with an interpretative reconciliation of the rival creeds, and this rapprochement led to the creation of many syncretic images. These icons either emphasize the sectarian view ? to this class belongs, for example, the image of Sarabha, the incarnatory form of Siva, killing Narasimha in the composite form of man, bird and beast ? or, they represent the rapprochement and unity between the rival sects. And to this second class may be as? signed the figures of Hari-Hara, Ardhan?rlsvara, Panc?yatana Sivalinga and Hiranyagarbha, etc. The spirit of reconciliation and rapprochement between the divergent sects lie behind this attitude in religion. The Upanisads and Smrti-S?stras including Manu, Y?jnavalkya and Gltd also encouraged the growth of this liberal view and religious thought. And, therefore, many of the liberal thinkers among the various sects realized that their respective gods were but different forms of the One Supreme Soul. This led to the production of S m?rt as who evolved the system of Panc?yatanap?j?, representing the five principal deities of the Hindu cult as the objects of worship in the form of aniconic emblems (2). The mental attitude of the alien immigrants into India, the Sakas, the Pahlavas, the Kus?nas and the H?nas was also a contributory factor to the growth of rapprochement be? tween various cults. They had a liberal view towards the different creeds of the Hindu religion, which can be illustrated by the coins of these early foreign rulers. The coins of Maues, the Parthian king Gondophares and the great Kus?na kings representing the figures of Siva in varied devices along with other deities of different religions such as Zoroastrian, Brahmanical, Buddhist and, rarely, Greek (3) may be mentioned in this context. A few coins of Huviska represent N?n? with Siva, or Um? with Siva (4), supporting a view of cult-syncretism. It is interesting to note that one of the gold coins of the same king repre? sents the composite cult-god Hari-Hara (5). The remarkable composition on the seal of the Hephtalite H?na chief depicts the composite form of Mihira (Sun god), Visnu and Siva in {*) The attempts at reconciliation of rival creeds may be traced from the early Vedk period: Rgveda, I 164, 46.

This tendency towards reconciliation led to the sculpturing of syncretic icons from the Kus?na period onwards. In Uttar Pradesh, syncretic icons were carved from the early centuries and a num? ber of such images have been discovered in various parts of the state. These icons are sub? divided as follows, in order to facilitate their study: 1. Sahasra-linga with composite deities 2. Composite Sivalinga; 3. Ardhan?rTsvara; 4. Haryardha; 5. Hari-Hara-Pit?maha (Datt?treya); 6. Hari-Hara-Hiranyagarbha. Sahasra-linga with composite deities The Sahasra-linga from Chandpur, Jhansi (fig. 1) is unique in showing Brahma mounted on a swan, dancing Ganesa, S?rya holding lotuses in both hands, along with Bh?devi-Ma h?svet?, and P?rvatI holding a water vessel in the left hand, and with the right held in the varada (bestowing favour) position. These figures are depicted one on each face of the middle octagonal portion of the Sahasra-linga which is carved with a thousand and one lingas. On stylistic grounds, the linga may be attributed to c. 10th century A.D. However, we have not come across any literary description of this variety. It may also be mentioned that this var? iety has not been reported, as far as we know, from any other part of the country. It may, therefore, be presumed that the present Sahasra-linga is a regional type which was conceived in the wake of sectarian reconcilation. Composite Sivalinga The linga from Jageshwar, Almora, represents four deities, one on each face. The first face (fig. 2) depicts S?rya, standing in the samabhanga (straight) position and wearing a tiara, ear-rings, necklace and long boots. He carries lotuses in both his raised hands. The second face shows Ganesa in a dancing position; he carries a lotus in the front right hand, a rosary in the back right, a battle-axe in the back left, and the fourth hand is shown in a dancing posture. Drum and cymbal players are also carved. The third face has the figure of K?rttikeya in the samabhanga position, with k?kapaksa hairstyle and wearing his usual (6) R. Ghirshman, Les Chionites-Hephtalites, (MDAFA, XIII), Le Caire, 1948, pp. 55-58, fig. 65, pi. VII 1. 340</page><page sequence="3">ornaments. He carries a rosary, a sakti (spear), a bilva fruit, while the fourth hand is missing. A male and female attendant are shown below. The fourth face represents P?rvatI, car? rying a rosary, a trident, a water vessel and a snake in her four hands. Two female atten? dants and her lion mount are shown below. A sculpture in the Mathura Museum (No. 58.4720) shows a similar composite Sivalinga. It is partly damaged and represents four dei? ties, namely, Siva with his mount Nandl, accompanied by two male attendants; four-faced Brahma with two female attendants; Visnu, with broken hands and only the conch extant; and lastly, S?rya with Danda and Pingala. This sculpture may be assigned to c. 10th century A.D., and we could not trace anywhere a corresponding textual description (7). Ardhan?rlsvara The Brhatsamhit?, without giving details, states only that the lord Siva may be repre? sented as having P?rvatI for his left half (8). The Visnudharmottara records that the left half of the body of the deity should be of P?rvatI, and that he should have four hands car? rying a rosary and a trident in the right hands and a mirror and lotus in the left ones. The deity should have one face and two eyes, and should wear all the usual ornaments. He is represented as Prakrti (Nature) and Purusa (Spirit) in unison known as Gaurisvara, and worshipped by all men (9). The Matsya-Pur?na states that he should carry a trident and bowl in the right hands, and a mirror and lotus in the left (10). According to the Linga-Pur?na the Ardhan?rlsvara form is the composite aspect of Linga and Yoni, representing Siva and P?rvatI respectively, and the two create the world (21). According to the ?gamas the Ardhan?rlsvara form should represent the right half as male or Siva and the left half as female or P?rvatI. The male half should have jat?-mukuta on the head, adorned with a crescent moon, nakra, sarpa or an ordinary kundala (ear-ring) in the right ear, tiger-skin as garments below the loins, a n?ga-yajnopavlta (holy-thread) a sarpa-mekhal? (a snake-girdle) and should be awe-inspiring. The right half of the forehead should have half an eye sculptured. The left female half should wear karanda-mukuta (a type of crown) or a fine knot of well-combed hair, a hall-tilaka mark on the forehead, v?lik?-kundala (ear-ring) in the left ear, necklace, armlets and anklets. This half portion should be draped in multi? coloured silken cloth covering the body down to the ankle, and also should have the bosom of a woman with round, well developed breast, and should be pacific in appearance. The image of N?risvara should have two, three, or four arms. In case of two hands the right should be held in the vavada position, or may carry a bowl; and the left one may be hang (7) These images can be compared with the Panc?yatana Sivalinga from Bihar (exhibited in the Indian Museum); cf. Banerjea, op. cit., p. 545), but the absence of Visnu in the former image, and of Devi and Ganesa in the latter means that these plaques cannot be considered as the cult emblems of a Sm?rta practising Panc?? yatana- p?j?.

If there are three arms, there should be only one on the left side carrying either a flower, a mirror or a parrot. If there are four arms, one of the right hands should be shown in the abhaya position and the other as car? rying a battle-axe; or else, in the varada position with a trident or a tanka (chisel-like weapon). One of the left hands may be resting on Nandi, and the other kept in the kataka position, holding a blue lotus (12). The images of Ardhan?risvara, signifying the syncretic character of this form in the union of male and female energies, as Siva and Sakti, are evenly distributed all over Uttar Pradesh. First carved in the Kus?na age, this composite form continues up to the late medi? eval period. The earliest Kus?na images (Mathura Museum, Nos. S. 15, 800 and 874) represent the right-half as male with matted locks, wearing tiger-skin up to the knee, and a holy thread, and the left half as female with knotted combed hair, feminine face and well-developed breast. She wears a necklace, ear-ring and drapery up to the ankle. A notable feature of these images is the ?rdhvaretas (ithyphallic) aspect, so characteristic of Siva. Nandi is also shown. The deity is invariably two-armed ? the right one held in the abhaya position and the left one holding an indistinct object (13). The Ardhan?risvara image in the Gupta period is more slender and delicate, having lotus-eyes, elongated ears and an oval face. The two heads from the Mathura Museum (Nos. 362 and 722) may be classed among the best products of the classical tradition of the Gupta age. The image No. 362 represents the right-half with elaborate ]at?-mukuta formed by matted locks and a slender crescent is stuck in it. Half of Siva's third eye is seen on the right half of the forehead with a tilaka mark on the left. The female portion has plaited hair adorned with a crest jewel and a lotus bud. The ear on this side is adorned with a big ring which has a pearl string. The facial features of the right and left portions have dis? tinct male and female characteristic. The sculpture No. 722 preserves only part of the chest along with the head. A few locks of hair fall on the right side of the chest. The left part of the lips, the left cheek and eye are delicately carved. The third eye is present on the forehead and a necklace adorns the neck. The right and left halves are similar to the images reported above. These heads of the deity correspond to the description in the ?gamas. In the medieval period the Ardhan?risvara images (State Museum, Lucknow, Nos. H. 15 and 57.303; Allahabad Museum? No. 267) had further evolved in accordance with the canons. The deity stands in the samabhanga (straight) or tribhanga (three bends in body) position, the right half represents Siva and the left half P?rvatl. A halo is often shown behind the head of the deity. He is frequently shown with four arms (14). The deity is also (12) T. A. G. Rao, Elements of Hindu Icono? graphy, II 1, Madras, 1916, pp. 323-26. (13) Mathura, No. 2520. (14) The left half representing P?rvatI is shown with a mirror in the left hand (No. H.15). The feature tallies with the description of the Visnu dharmottara and the Matsya-Purana. 342</page><page sequence="5">accompanied by figures of Ganesa, K?rttikeya, Nandi and a lion. The slab in the Sarnath Museum (No. 624) depicts the Ardhan?rlsvara figure with ithyphallic Siva on the right, showing the continuation of the earliest form of the deity. Haryardha (Hari-Hara) Another syncretic form of Hari-Hara was produced by combining Siva and Visnu for the first time in the Gupta period. Banerjea traces the beginning of the image to the Kus?na period (15) and emphasizes its conciliatory aspect with reference to the two major cults of Vaisnavism and Saivism ("). According to the Visnudharmottara, the right half of the Hari-Hara image should be Siva and the left Visnu. He should carry a trident in one right hand, with the other held in the varada position; and a lotus and a discus in the left hands. On his right should be a bull, and on his left Garuda (17). The R?pamandana gives us a description similar to that of the Visnudharmottara (18). The Matsya-Pur?na records that Siva-N?r?yana should wear their ornaments and carry a conch or discus in one of the left hands, the other holding a mace, and a trident in one right hand, the other held in the varada position (19). According to the Silparatna (20), Suprabhedagama (21) and Uttarak?mik?gama (22), the left half of this form should be Visnu, and the right half Siva. The deity should be stand? ing in the samabhahga position, and his left portion should be shown with a crown, ear? ring, garland; a conch and a discus should be placed in the left hands. The right half should have matted locks, a rosary in the ear and a garland; the hands on the right should carry a trident and a rosary. Nandi should also be shown (23). The Haryardha images were first produced in the Gupta period. The Kuthari Pillar (now in the collection of the Allahabad Museum, No. 292) shows a remarkable figure of Haryardha with ?yudha purusas (the anthropomorphic forms of emblems of deities). The characteristic features of Visnu and Siva are respectively shown on the left and right halves, consisting of crown, ear-ring and drapery on the left, and matted locks, holy thread and tiger-skin on the right. The interesting figures of the ?yudhapurusas represent cakra (dis? cus) and tris?la (trident). The upper hands hold an indistinct object in the right and probably a conch in the left. The lower left hand carries a discus placed over Cakrapurusa. Similarly, the lower right hand rests on a two-armed male figure with a three-pronged trident jutting out of his matted hair, identified as a Trisulapurusa. The image agrees with the Matsya-Pur?na (24) in bearing a trident, a conch and a discus. In the Mathura Museum (Nos. 1333, 1336 and 2510), the three heads of Hari-Hara, belonging to the Gupta period, (15) Op. cit., pp. 123 ff. (16) Ibid., p. 546.

The head-gear of these images is divided into two halves, the right side has matted locks forming a jat?-mukuta, while the left side has a kirita-mukuta. A number of Hari-Hara images of the medieval period have been found in various parts of the State, sculptured according to the textual injunctions. A Baijnath sculpture repre? sents the deity in a standing position, wearing on the left half a tiara, an ear-ring, garland and armlets representing Visnu, and the right half is adorned with matted locks, snake-coils ring and a skull garland. He has four arms, holding a discus in the back left, and a trident in the back right hand; the remaining two hands are broken. On the left and right sides Garuda and Nandi are shown. Moreover, on the left recessed corner Padmapurusa, and on the right Virabhadra, are also carved. The image partly corresponds with the description of the Visnudharmottara. A State Museum image (No. H. 119) shows the deity with four arms, carrying a conch and a discus in the left hands? and a rosary and a trident in the right ones. The other figures are those of Garuda, Nandi, Padmapurusa, Virabhadra and Vidy? dharas. The image agrees perfectly with the description of the ? gam as. An image from Chandpur, Jhansi, represents Hari-Hara, standing in the samabhanga position (fig. 3). The deity is ornamented as usual, and has four arms, carrying conch and club in the left hands and trident and rosary in the right ones; the lower one is held in the varada position. One attendant is standing on either side. The stereotype image concords with the description of the Matsya-Pur?na, and belongs to c. 12th-13th century A.D. Hari-Hara-Pit?maha (Datt?treya) According to the M?rkandeya-Pur?na, Datt?treya is a minor incarnation of Visnu (25). The Visnudharmottara states that Datt?treya should be sculptured like V?lmiki (2e). The Apar?jitaprccha (27), and the R?pamandana (28) furnish somewhat similar descriptions of the deity under the name of Hari-Hara-Pit?maha. Datt?treya should be sculptured, so that Brahm?, Visnu and Siva should be standing side by side or sitting in padm?sana (lotus seat) with their usual attributes (29). An image of Hari-Hara-Pit?maha may be seen at Jageshwar, Almora and another is exhibited in the State Museum, Lucknow (No. G. 57). The Jageshwar image (fig. 5) depicts the deities standing side by side in the samabhanga position. Brahm? is shown on the right proper, wearing matted locks, a necklace, holy thread, a girdle and armlets, and has four faces. The deity carries a rosary in the front right hand and a lotus flower in the back right; a water vessel in the front left hand and sruva (sacrificial spoon) in the back left. Siva is shown in the centre, wearing matted locks, ear-pendants, armlets and drapery. The four armed deity carries a rosary in the front right hand, a trident in the back right, and a snake (25) Quoted from Rao, op. cit., I 1, Madras, 1914, pp. 251 f. (26) III 85, 65. (27) 213, 30-31.

Nandi on his right, and Ganesa on his left are seated below. On the left Visnu is depicted with tiara, garland, armlets, anklets, and a girdle. He holds a rosary in the front right hand, a mace in the back right; a conch in the front left hand and a discus in the back left. On his right Laksmi is stand? ing with a lotus in her right hand. The image corresponds to the prescription in the ?gamas, and may be placed in c. 10th century A.D. A State Museum image (No. G. 57) is almost similarly carved with the deities standing side by side wearing their usual orna? ments. The image slightly varies in representing Visnu in the centre; he keeps his right hand in the varada position, instead of holding a rosary. Brahma carries a book in the up? per right hand, while Siva holds altogether different attributes ? sakti in the upper right hand, a lotus flower in the lower right hand, and a water-vessel in the lower left hand. The image is executed in accordance with the Agamas, and may be assigned to c. 10th cen? tury A.D. Harl-Hara-Hiranyagarbha According to the M?rkandeya-Pur?na, the three forms of S?rya symbolize the bodies of Brahma, Siva and Visnu (30). The S?rda Tilaka T antra states that S?rya is the personifi? cation of Brahma, Visnu and Siva (31). The Apar?jitaprccha describes the image of Harl Hara-Hiranyagarbha as the combined form of S?rya, Brahma, Visnu and Siva. The deity should be shown on the front face with lotuses in both hands; Siva on the right with trident and khatv?nga (a club of bone and skull); Visnu on the left with conch and discus; and Brahma on the back with water vessel and rosary (32). The Chandpur image in a niche of the Siva temple shows the combined figures of Harl-Hara-Hiranyagarbha with three faces, the back one concealed (fig. 4). The front figure represents S?rya, wearing tiara, ear-rings, necklace, armlets, a girdle over the decorated loin? cloth and long boots. He holds lotuses in both hands. The left figure shows only one hand (the other concealed) carrying a conch in it and, therefore obviously representing Visnu. The right figure also has one hand held in the varada position, and probably represents Siva. The feet of the side figures are visible beside those of the S?rya image. On either side a female attendant is standing in the tribhanga position with a fly-whisk in her hand. The combined figures of S?rya, Visnu and Siva indicate that the fourth one would probably have been represented as Brahma on the concealed back face; and as such, the sculpture is iden? tified as Harl-Hara-Hiranyagarbha. It partly corresponds with the iconographic description of the Apar?jitaprccha, and may be assigned to c. 10th century A.D. An image in the Sar nath Museum (No. 623) similarly represents Harl-Hara-Hiranyagarbha with three faces (the fourth one concealed) and eight arms, which are all broken. The front figure depicts S?rya (30) CIX 71. (31) XIV 41-42. (32) 213, 32-34. 345</page><page sequence="11">dressed as usual on a chariot drawn by horses (three of them are shown), and the lame driver Aruna. The side figures represent Visnu and Siva. The figures of K?rttikeya and Siva are carved, one on either side. The sculpture may be placed in c. 10th century A.D. The interesting point of the image is that the chariot and horses are also associated with the Harl-Hara-Hiranyagarbha image ? a rare iconographic composition. 346</page></plain_text>
