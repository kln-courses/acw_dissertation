<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paradoxes of Dehumanization David Livingstone Smith Abstract: In previous writings, I proposed that we dehumanize others by attributing the essence of a less-than-human creature to them, in order to disable inhibitions against harm ing them. However, this account is inconsistent with the fact that dehumanizers implicitly, and often explicitly, acknowledge the human status of their victims. I propose that when we dehumanize others, we regard them as simultaneously human and subhuman. Drawing on the work of Ernst Jentsch (psychology), Mary Douglas (anthropology), and Noël Carroll (philos ophy), I argue that the notion of dehumanized people as metaphysically transgressive pro vides important insights into the distinctive phenomenology of dehumanization. Keywords: dehumanization; essentialism; hierarchy; uncanny; impure; monster; racism; genocide The final paradox of the search for purity is that it is an attempt to force experience into logical categories of non-contradiction. —Mary Douglas Introduction They did not know that the [Tutsi] were human beings, because if they had thought about that they wouldn't have killed them. Let me include myself as someone who accepted it. I wouldn't have accepted that they are human beings.1 These words were spoken by Elie Ngarambe, a Hutu man who partici pated in the slaughter of Tutsi during the Rwanda genocide—a man who clubbed women, men, and children to death because they were Tutsi. Words like these have been uttered countless times by perpetrators of atrocity. Time after time, genocide after genocide, they characterize those whom they wish to harm as less-than-human creatures, and in so doing diminish their moral status to such an extent as to make the commission of the most hideous acts of violence against them permissible or even obligatory. There is nothing novel in the assertion that dehumanization is a psy chological lubricant for the machinery of violence. In fact, this is some thing of a truism. However, the phenomenon of dehumanization presents 'Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism, and the On going Assault on Humanity (New York: Public Affairs, 2009), p. 182. © Copyright 2016 by Social Theory and Practice, Vol. 42, No. 2 (April 2016): 416-443 DOT: 10.5840/soctheorpract201642222</page><page sequence="2">Paradoxes of Dehumanization 417 some difficult explanatory problems. The most salient and perplexing of these is the problem of providing a satisfactory explanation of how it is possible to conceive of other human beings—beings that are, in all funda mental respects, indistinguishable from oneself—as not really human at all, but as organisms that are more akin to rats, lice, snakes, or cock roaches. Understandably, some will regard this flagrantly implausible, be cause it seems so remote from commonsensical ideas about how human minds work. Grounds for skepticism are compounded by the fact that those who characterize their victims as nonhuman animals also describe them in ways that are uniquely applicable to human beings. For example, even though Hutu genocidaires notoriously characterized their Tutsi quarry as cockroaches and snakes, they more often used terms like "enemy" and "accomplices of the enemy" to describe them—terms that only make sense when applied to human beings.2 Furthermore, dehumanizers often behave towards their victims in a manner that implicitly acknowledges their hu manity. For instance, during the 1994 genocide, thousands of Tutsi women were raped by Hutu militiamen. This behavior was motivated, in part, by the desire to humiliate these women before killing them. But one does not seek to humiliate cockroaches.3 Daniel Goldhagen notes that perpetrators "routinely degrade and torture their victims physically." They degrade them by using them as playthings, bending them to their will, using them to display their dominance, showing them in so many, often diabolical ways that they are masters and the victims are without rights, respect, or the basic human protections. The perpetrators imprint on their victims' bodies, and therefore their psyches, their conception of them as worthless or vile beings who deserve their hopeless fate.4 Considerations like these suggest that literalists about dehumanizing discourse may be barking up the wrong tree. Perhaps ostensible dehuman izers do not really believe that their victims are subhuman, but use dehu manizing language as a means to demean them or as a deliberate attempt to rationalize acts of abominable cruelty. My aim in this paper is to show that the strangeness of dehumanization, and dehumanizers' implicit recognition of the human character of their vic tims, need not motivate skepticism about it. The task of accounting for the strangeness of dehumanization cannot be addressed adequately until we have a more detailed account of what dehumanization is. In the first part of the paper I will supply such an account. I will then turn to the challenge of 2Scott Straus, The Order of Genocide: Race, Power, and War in Rwanda (Ithaca: Cor nell University Press, 2008). 3Llezlie Green Coleman, "Gender Hate Propaganda and Sexual Violence in the Rwan dan Genocide: An Argument for Intersectionality in International Law," Columbia Human Rights Law Review 33 (2002): 733-76. 4Goldhagen, Worse Than War, p. 183.</page><page sequence="3">418 David Livingstone Smith explaining why the explicit denial of victims' humanity often goes hand in-hand with its implicit affirmation. I will argue that in dehumanizing others, we categorize them simultaneously as human and subhuman, and that this gives dehumanization its distinctive character and differentiates it from the purely rhetorical use of animalistic language to characterize oth ers. I will then show how this theoretical apparatus has the added ad vantages of accounting for several hitherto unexplained features of the phenomenology of dehumanization and providing a framework for identi fying and explaining three distinct varieties of dehumanization. Preliminaries The Oxford English Dictionary states that the term "dehumanize" made its debut early in the nineteenth century. Since then, it has acquired a range of loosely connected meanings, including: (1) Subjecting others to indignities; or, in a more Kantian vein, treating them merely as means.5 (2) Verbally likening others to nonhuman animals or inanimate objects.6 (3) Denying the subjectivity, individuality, agency, or distinctively human attributes of others.7 (4) Denying that others undergo mental states.8 (5) Treating others in such a way as to erode, obstruct, or extinguish some of their distinctively human attributes.9 (6) Conceiving of others as inanimate objects.10 (7) Conceiving of others as less human than members of one's ingroup." 5Catharine A.

I use "dehumanization" in the sense specified in (8). This conception of dehumanization is not wholly unrelated to the others. It is compatible with, and is very likely to lead to, subjecting those others to indignities, referring to them as non human animals, denying certain of their distinctively human attributes, or treating them in such a way as to diminish or obliterate certain of their distinctively human attributes. Any of these consequences might be indic ative of dehumanization, in this sense, but none of them is constitutive of it. So the fact that one person refers to another as an animal or treats the other in a manner normally reserved for nonhuman animals does not on its own show that she dehumanizes that person. I emphasize this point be cause distinct senses of "dehumanization" are all-too-easily conflated in both scholarly and nonscholarly discourse. I approach dehumanization as a psychological phenomenon and cite processes unfolding in individual human minds to explain how and why it occurs. It might be objected that this strategy ignores the causal signifi cance of political and ideological forces and misleadingly individualizes what is in fact a collective, social phenomenon. I do not think that this objection is well taken. It is true that I do barely address the political di mension of dehumanization, but my neglect of it is methodological. De humanization is characteristically elicited by political propaganda and nur tured by ideologically suffused social practices. However, political forces can entrain human behavior only by meshing with human psychology. A psychological account is therefore mandatory for providing explanatory purchase on how political forces shape dehumanizing behavior. More ex plicitly, I suggest that although the content of dehumanization—the choice of which group of people is regarded as less than human, and the manner in which representations of that group of people are cast (as rats, as lice, as wolves, as apes, and so on)—is politically determined, the form of de humanization, that is, the pattern of thinking that makes dehumanization possible, must be explained with reference to our psychological disposi tions.13 12Daniel Chirot and Clark McCauley, Why Not Kill Them All?

To be credible, it should comport with our best psychological science and draw on the results of empirical psychological research when ever possible. This is not to say that a theory of dehumanization must abjure commonsense psychological platitudes entirely, only that, to be credible, it should engage with and privilege empirical findings about the psycho logical wellsprings of human behavior as well as the most adequate theo retical interpretations of those findings. As it turns out, there is a substantial scientific research literature that is not only relevant to the moral psychol ogy of dehumanization but, I believe, indispensable for understanding it. The Phenomenon When we dehumanize others, we assign them a peculiar status. We typi cally think of them as beings that appear human and behave in human-like ways, but that are really subhuman on the "inside."14 Conceiving of others in this way is only possible with the support of a network of interlocking folk-metaphysical assumptions.15 Teasing out these assumptions and show ing how they cohere with one another is the first step toward unpacking the moral psychology of dehumanization. I approach this task with the help of an example. Morgan Godwyn was an Anglican clergyman who campaigned for the humane treatment of Na tive Americans and African slaves in a remarkable series of writings pub lished in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. His best known work, entitled The Negro's and Indians Advocate Suing for Their 14This describes what is probably the most common form of dehumanization. However, I will later suggest that there is a form of dehumanization, or perhaps more accurately a phenomenon that is akin to dehumanization, in which the victim is regarded as inwardly human but outwardly subhuman. The latter should not be confused with the idea that peo ple are dehumanized solely because of their "otherness." For instance, it is false to claim that Europeans thought of Africans as subhuman primates because they departed both physically and culturally from European expectations. In fact, Europeans' simianization of Africans coincided with the transatlantic slave trade, and was rare or nonexistent prior to it. See David Livingstone Smith and Ioana Panaitiu, "Apeing the Human Essence: Simian ization as Dehumanization," in Wulf D. Hund, Charles W. Mills, and Silvia Sebastiani (eds.), Simianization: Apes, Gender, Class, and Race (Hamburg: University of Hamburg Press, 2016). 15This is not to deny that there are more formal metaphysical justifications for dehuman izing others (for example, Aristotelian philosophers' deployment of the theory of natural slav ery to justify brutal forms of colonialism). However, philosophers' metaphysical intuitions may be grounded in the same cognitive biases that are responsible for folk-metaphysical com mitments. See Sarah-Jane Leslie, "Essence and Natural Kinds: When Science Meets Pre schooler Intuition," in Tamar Szabô Gendler and John Hawthorne (eds.), Oxford Studies in Epistemology, Vol. 4 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2013), pp. 108-65.</page><page sequence="6">Paradoxes of Dehumanization 421 Admission into the Church, published in 1680, is a valuable source of in formation about Europeans' dehumanization of enslaved Africans during that period. In it, Godwyn informs his readers that he had been told by Englishmen "That the Negro's, though in their Figure they carry some resemblances of Manhood, yet are indeed no Men"16 Consequently, he says, they are "Unman'd and Unsoul'd; accounted, and even ranked with Brutes'''11—"Creatures destitute of Souls, to be ranked among Brute Beasts, and treated accordingly."18 Nor ... without that proton pseudos of their Negro's brutality do I see how those other Inhumanities, as their Emasculating and Beheading them, their cropping off their Ears (which they usually cause the Wretches to broil, and then compel to eat them themselves); their Amputations of Legs, and even Dissecting them alive; (this last I cannot say was ever practiced, but has been certainly affirmed by some of them, as no less allowable than to a Beast of which they did not in the least doubt that it was justifiable).19 Godwyn's report points to five folk-metaphysical commitments upon which the dehumanization of Africans was predicated. (1) It is possible for a being to appear to be human without being hu man.20 European colonists acknowledged that Africans are outwardly indis tinguishable from human beings ("carry some resemblances of manhood") but they nonetheless denied them human status ("are indeed no men"). (2) To be human, one must possess a human essence. A human-looking being that lacks this essence is not human. The supposed metaphysical ground of Africans' subhumanity was that they did not possess human souls ("creatures destitute of souls"). For seventeenth-century Christians, the soul was thought to be what makes one human. This is an historically contingent fact.21 What is important, and generalizable, is the idea that 16Morgan Godwyn, Negro's and Indians Advocate Suing for Their Admission into the Church [1680] (Whitefish, Mt.: Kessinger Publishing, 2003), p. 3. 17Ibid., p. 24.

An ex-slave named Robert Burns reported to an interviewer that he was told by a preacher that "Only white people had souls and went to heaven. He told dem dat niggers had no</page><page sequence="7">422 David Livingstone Smith there is some deep attribute, or small set of attributes, that all and only humans possess. (3) There is a hierarchy of natural kinds on which humans occupy a higher rank than nonhuman animals. It is clear from Godwyn's account that Europeans conceived of the world as constituted by a hierarchy of kinds according to which humans occupy a higher status than nonhuman animals. Any kind lower on the hierarchy than humankind is subhuman ("rank'd with the brute beasts"). (4) To be a member of a subhuman kind one must have the essence of that kind. European colonists did not merely assert that Africans were non human. They asserted that they were subhuman. They did not merely lack what is required to make one human: they possessed whatever is required to make one subhuman ("brute beasts")—by implication, the essence of a subhuman thing. (5) The cosmic hierarchy is a moral hierarchy. The higher a being is ranked, the greater is its moral considerability. In assigning Africans to a subhuman rank, Europeans regarded them as less morally considerable than human beings ("treated accordingly"). These five assumptions are generalizable to other cases of dehumani zation. They seem to be present whenever dehumanization occurs and may be necessary in order for it to occur. The next stage in our inquiry is to try and determine how best to account for these folk-metaphysical intuitions psychologically. Psychological Essentialism Psychologists began to study dehumanization during the latter part of the twentieth century, but research into the topic was very sparse until the con tributions of Jacques-Philippe Leyens and Nick Haslam, beginning in the late 1990s. There is now a substantial psychological research literature on dehumanization (or "infrahumanization" as it is sometimes called), almost all of which is strongly influenced by the work of Leyens and Haslam. Leyens and Haslam, as well as most of the other psychologists who in vestigate dehumanization, make use of the theory of psychological essen tialism. I am among those who hold that psychological essentialism is cru cial for understanding dehumanization; however, I believe that the analyses offered by Leyens and Haslam, and the psychologists who adopt their views, rely on a misconstrual of psychological essentialism and, consequently, an more soul than dogs, and dey couldn't go to heaven any more than could a dog."

I have discussed the deficits these ac counts in considerable detail elsewhere and so will not cover that ground again here.22 Instead, I will set out my position on the role that psycholog ical essentialism properly plays in the analysis of dehumanization. Over the past twenty-five years or so, psychologists have accumulated a wealth of empirical data pointing to the conclusion that human beings are generally disposed to think of the world as carved up into natural kinds each of which is individuated by a unique, immutable causal essence.22. Causal essences are not merely definitional criteria. They are assumed to be "deep" unobservable attributes the possession of which is both neces sary and sufficient for making a thing a member of a natural kind and which, crucially, are supposed to account causally for the observable at tributes that are typically possessed by members of that kind. These essen tialist intuitions lead us to think that natural kind membership is fixed by features of a thing's internal constitution—even though we rarely have a precise conception of what it is that its essence consists in (Douglas Medin and Andrew Ortony refer to it as a "placeholder" notion).24 Very importantly for our purposes, folk-essentialist intuitions allow that the essence of a thing can come apart from its appearance.25 Consider a biological kind: the North American Porcupine. From a psychologically essentialist perspective, porcupines are individuated by their possession of the porcupine essence. The causal essence possessed by North American Porcupines is supposedly expressed through such kind-typical phenotypic attributes as being covered in sharp quills, being quadrupedal, being greyish-brown in color, and so on. Nevertheless, a deviant porcupine (one whose normal development is impeded) might never develop quills, or be oddly shaped, or have more or fewer than four legs, or be peculiarly col ored. In fact, a deviant porcupine might be difficult to distinguish from some other kind of animal (for instance, a wombat) without thereby ceas ing to be a porcupine. And by the same token, folk-essentialism allows that a developmentally deviant wombat might superficially resemble a typical porcupine more than it does a typical wombat. 22See David Livingstone Smith, "Dehumanization, Essentialism, and Moral Psychol ogy," Philosophy Compass 9 (2014): 814-24. 23Douglas Medin and Andrew Ortony, "Psychological Essentialism," in Stella Vosni adou and Andrew Ortony (eds.), Similarity and Analogical Reasoning (Cambridge: Cam bridge University Press, 1989), pp. 179-95. 24Compare with John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (Indianap olis: Hackett, 1986), on real essences: "[I]f you demand what those real essences are, it is plain that men are ignorant and know them not ... and yet, though we know nothing of these real essences, there is nothing more ordinary than that men should attribute the sorts of things to such essences" (p. 162, emphasis added). 25Elliott Sober, "Evolution, Population Thinking, and Essentialism," Philosophy of Sci ence 47 (1980): 350-83.</page><page sequence="9">424 David Livingstone Smith That members of an essentialized kind might have atypical manifest attributes while retaining their membership in the kind is crucial for mak ing sense of what goes on when we dehumanize others, because it explains how it is possible to think of a being that appears human as possessing a nonhuman essence, and therefore as being nonhuman.26 Subhumanity Psychological essentialism is silent about the notion of .swMiumanity. As was evident in the discussion of Godwyn, dehumanized people are con sidered to be less than human—as subhuman—in a specifically moral sense. When we dehumanize others, we think of them as having less in trinsic value than human beings. This is consistent with dehumanized peo ple having considerable instrumental value. Southern slaveholders often thought of their slaves as less than human despite their having very con siderable economic value. The notion of subhumanity falls out from the view that the cosmos is structured as a hierarchy of natural kinds—a hier archy that is at once descriptive and normative. The rank that is occupied by any given kind, relative to the others, is commensurate with the intrinsic value of that kind, relative to the others. The idea that each natural kind has a fixed rank on a hierarchy of value was formalized in late antiquity as the Great Chain of Being. According to Arthur O. Lovejoy, whose book on the subject is still the definitive schol arly treatment of the subject (and virtually the only one), the Great Chain of Being arose from the confluence of Platonic and Aristotelian thought: the Platonic principle ofplentitude (the notion that, necessarily, everything that possibly exists actually exists) and the Aristotelian law of continuity (the claim that properties vary continuously rather than discretely).27 It is true that a particular formalized version of the cosmic hierarchy took shape in European philosophy during late antiquity and persisted, through vari ous transformations, until the nineteenth century. However, the idea is considerably older, more widespread, and more deeply entrenched in our pretheoretical moral intuitions than Lovejoy suggests.28 Its tenacity is such 26For a fascinating neuroscientific perspective on the psychology of dehumanization, see Anthony I.

The remarkable pervasiveness and persistence of the idea of the Great Chain of Being suggests that it is an entrenched feature of our moral psy chology. Perhaps our disposition to rank kinds of beings in accord with their intrinsic value is a projection onto the cosmos of the stratification of human societies. Alternatively, the ranking of kinds may be a necessary condition of any moral system whatsoever, as it is difficult to conceive of a moral system that does not require one to differentiate between the rela tive moral considerability of kinds of entities and therefore that does not entail some notion of an objective, morally infused hierarchy of natural kinds. Unfortunately, the folk-metaphysics of moral ranking has been al most completely neglected by psychologists, so there is no substantial re search literature on which we can draw to illuminate this component of the dehumanizing impulse. Why Dehumanize? Dehumanization is best understood as a solution to a problem: the problem of ambivalence. It scarcely needs saying that it is sometimes advantageous for one group of people to harm another by exploiting their labor, laying claim to their possessions, or exterminating them for the sake of Lebens raum. Notwithstanding this, there is a substantial body of evidence in sup port of the contention that violence—especially lethal violence—does not come easily to us. The commonsensical notion that it is psychologically easy to kill or harm others is a myth, probably derived from misleading literary and cinematic portrayals.29 Even in combat, where taking human life is both demanded and rewarded, killing is difficult. As U.S. Army his torian S.L.A. Marshall famously remarked, 29 Rachel M. MacNair, Perpetration-Induced Traumatic Stress: The Psychological Consequences of Killing (New York: Authors Choice Press, 2005); Paul Roscoe, "Intelli gence, Coalitional Killing, and the Antecedents of War," American Anthropologist 109 (2007): 485-95; David Livingstone Smith, The Most Dangerous Animal: Human Nature and the Origins of War (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2007); Randall Collins, Violence: A Micro-Sociological Theory (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2009); Dave Gross man, On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society (Boston: Back Bay Books, 2009); Smith, Less Than Human-, David Livingstone Smith and Ioana Panaitiu, "Horror Sanguinis," Common Knowledge 22 (2016): 69-80.</page><page sequence="11">426 David Livingstone Smith the average and normally healthy individual—the man who can endure the mental and phys ical stresses of combat—still has such an inner and usually unrealized resistance to killing a fellow man that he will not of his own volition take life if it is possible to turn away from that responsibility ... At the vital point he becomes a conscientious objector, unknowing.30 Harming others, then, can be simultaneously attractive (because advan tageous to the would-be killer) and repellent. Over the millennia, human beings developed methods for selectively disabling inhibitions against do ing violence to others, so as to reap the advantages attendant upon war, genocide, and oppression.31 Dehumanization is one of several means by which inhibitions against harming others are overridden.32 Conceiving of those whom we wish to harm as mere animals makes it permissible to do violence to them, and conceiving of them as dangerous animals renders such violence obligatory. This is not done deliberately. It is implausible to suppose that those who dehumanize others intentionally cause themselves to adopt the false belief that other human beings are subhuman animals. Instead, we should understand it as a kind of motivated but nondeliberate, goal-directed, self-induced misbelief—in short, a kind of self-deception.33 This view of the function of dehumanization should not be confused with the idea that dehumanization occurs on account of one failing to rec ognize the humanity of others. Conflict precedes and motivates dehuman ization: we dehumanize others because we want to kill, harm, or oppress them, rather than the other way around. The Challenge Although the account that I have sketched in the preceding pages is coher ent, and seems to throw light on an otherwise puzzling phenomenon, there are compelling reasons to question its explanatory adequacy. Most re cently, this challenge was articulated by Kate Manne. Manne notes that many have claimed that "people are treated brutally because those who mistreat them fail to grasp their common humanity—or, similarly, their personhood." The idea is that seeing another person as a fellow human being is not only a prerequisite for ethical relations with her, but also strongly disposes us to treat her as we ought to. In George Orwell's experience, when you see another person as "visibly a fellow-creature, similar to yourself, [then] you don't feel like shooting at him." (Or her—presumably.) Moreover, 30S.L. A.

Subordinated people are mistakenly viewed as brutes, subhuman, or even nonhuman animals.34 She goes on to discuss this view in relation to police officers' treatment of protesters in Ferguson, Missouri in the aftermath of the lethal shooting, by a policeman, of African American teenager Michael Brown. When, three days after the shooting, another white officer called the (primarily black) pro testers "[expletive] animals," it cemented many people's fears that Brown had been slain in a similar spirit—the thought being that the officer responsible, Darren Wilson, saw Brown as an animal, or at least as less than human. Witnesses are on record saying that Brown had his hands up, that he was posing no threat to the officer, but that Wilson "just kept shooting"— even after Brown backed down, in a classic gesture of surrender. Wilson shot at Brown as if he felt powerless to stop him, almost as if he were faced with a bear or an ape or a zombie.35 But Manne argues that this supposition is belied by the police officers' behavior with respect to the protesters. These actions ... reveal a resentful and punitive mentality behind the aggression, which are classic examples of what the English philosopher P.F. Strawson famously called the inter personal "reactive attitudes." These attitudes are held to be both distinctive and central to our dealings with other human beings—that is, with people who we recognize as such, or as fully paid-up members in this club we call humanity. When it comes to animals and children and people we regard as (temporarily or permanently) not in control of their ac tions, we may try to correct, manage, deter or restrain their behavior. But, ordinarily and ideally, we do not resent it. They are not moral agents. We can't really blame them.36 If one refers to others disparagingly as animals while treating them as persons, then it seems to follow that one does not really conceive of them as animals. Under these circumstances, Manne suggests, calling others an imals is an effort to disparage them, and it is an effort that is intelligible only if the name-caller is aware of the human status of those whom he (or she) is attempting to denigrate. At least in cases like this, those who call others animals do so because they recognize and feel threatened by (and hostile to) the others ' humanity. Of course, it is not clear that the police officer who called the protester an animal was dehumanizing (in my sense of the word) her, and there is nothing contradictory about claiming that dehumanization (in my sense of the word) is motivated by a recognition of the other's humanity—that is, after all, part of the account of the function of dehumanization that I have 34Kate Manne, "In Ferguson and Beyond, Punishing Humanity," The Stone, New York Times Opinionator section, 12 October 2014, http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/ 10/12/in-ferguson-and-beyond-punishing-humanity/. 3SIbid. 36Ibid.</page><page sequence="13">428 David Livingstone Smith sketched above.

There are many uncontroversial cases of dehumanization in which the dehumanized population is treated in precisely the manner that Manne specifies (consider Hutu genocidaires ' characterizations of Tutsis mentioned in the introduc tion to this paper, and Nazis' treatment of Jews). In fact, it is plausible that explicit dehumanization typically coexists with dehumanizers directing re active attitudes towards those whom they dehumanize. If I read Manne correctly, her point is not just that the recognition of the others' humanity motivates one's (ostensibly) dehumanizing them. It is that this recognition sustains it. Kwame Anthony Appiah makes a similar point in his 2008 book Ex periments in Ethics. Appiah states, in a discussion of genocidal violence, that it's "not quite right" to say that the dehumanization of victims ac counts for genocide, because ... it doesn't explain the immense cruelty—the abominable cruelty, I'm tempted to say— that are their characteristic feature. The persecutors may liken the objects of their enmity to cockroaches or germs, but they acknowledge their victims' humanity in the very act of humiliating, stigmatizing, reviling, and torturing them. Such treatment—and the voluble justifications the persecutors invariably offer for such treatment—is reserved for creatures we recognize to have intentions and desires and projects.37 He adds in a footnote that unlike those who are merely indifferent to the well-being of outgroup members, genocidal killers "tell you why their vic tims—Jews or Tutsi—deserve what's being done to them."38 And two years prior to Appiah's comments, Adam Gopnik also noted that dehumanizers' treatment of their victims often betrays an awareness of their humanity. Writing about the reign of terror in the aftermath of the French revolution, he observed that: It is often said that terror of this kind is possible only when one has first "dehumanized" some group of people—aristocrats, Jews, the bourgeoisie. In fact, what motivated the spec tacle was exactly the knowledge that the victims were people, and capable of feeling pain and fear as people do. We don't humiliate vermin, or put them through show trials, or make them watch their fellow-vermin die first. The myth of mechanical murder is almost always only that. (If one good thing emerged from Daniel Goldhagen's "Hitler's Willing Execu tioners," it was the demonstration that, contra Hannah Arendt, the actions of the Nazi mur derers were not detached and bureaucratic but actively sadistic and cruel.)39 37K.

Unlike these more re cent authors, Morgan Godwyn did not address the theory of dehumaniza tion (understandably, since there was no theory of dehumanization in the seventeenth century). Rather, he tried to show that although slaveholders explicitly regarded their African slaves as subhuman, their treatment of them indicated an implicit acknowledgment of the slaves' humanity. God wyn offered three arguments to this effect. First, he noted that slave own ers often placed slaves in positions of responsibility, and inquired as to "[W]hy should their Owners, Men of Reason no doubt, conceive them fit to exercise the place of Governors and Overseers to their fellow Slaves ... if they were but meer Brutes?" Second, he pointed out that planters treated their slaves as moral agents. "Why," he enquired, "should they be tor mented and whipt almost (and sometimes quite) to death, upon any Mis carriage ... were they (like Brutes) naturally destitute of Capacities equal to such undertakings?" This would, he added, be a "comical frenzie." Third, he noted that planters' practice of raping slaves was inconsistent with their regarding slaves as subhuman animals, remarking that "those Debauches, that so frequently do make use of them for their Unnatural pleasures and lusts ... Sure they would be loth to be endited of Sodomy, as for lying with a Beast."40 The problem identified by Manne, Appiah, Gopnik, and Godwyn is a genuine one. Our attitude to real nonhuman animals—however noxious they may appear to us—diverges from our attitude towards those whom we regard as beasts in human form. Nazis thought of Jews as vermin in human form, but there was no Auschwitz consecrated to the torture of real vermin. Those who dehumanize others seem to recognize, often enough, that their victims are rational agents to whom notions of desert apply, and characteristically treat them with the sort of cruelty—not mere callous ness—that presupposes their humanity. These considerations present us with what looks like a contradiction. Those who dehumanize others appear to be committed to two incompatible attitudes towards them. On one hand, they appear to believe that their vic tims are subhuman creatures, while on the other they seem to be implicitly aware of their victims' status as human beings. It is tempting to try to resolve the contradiction by proposing that perpetrators do not really conceive of their victims as subhuman, perhaps by rejecting the view that dehumanizing language is meant to be assertoric and suggesting instead that it is used to marginalize and humiliate the target group. But it is difficult to doubt that, in very many cases, dehumanizers sincerely believe that their victims are 40Godwyn, Negro's and Indians Advocate.</page><page sequence="15">430 David Livingstone Smith less than human.41 Often, perpetrators describe their victims to one another as subhumans. This makes little sense if the aim of dehumanizing language is to degrade and humiliate the victim. There are many other cases in which perpetrators give every indication of sincerity. For example, Goldhagen re ports that Elie Ngarambe was emphatic that the view that Tutsi are not hu man was very generally shared by their Hutu tormentors.42 Responding to the Challenge I will now explore an entirely different strategy for addressing the contra diction described in the previous section, one that may provide a deeper, more subtle analysis of dehumanization than alternative accounts (includ ing my own, sketched above) have done. I begin with a point that is obvious but that is all too often overlooked. A rat in rat form is something different from a rat in human form. A rat in rat form is just a rat. One might be frightened of or disgusted by rats, or one might be fond of them or interested in them. In contrast, there is some thing deeply unsettling—something intrinsically repellent and horrifying —about a rat in human form. A rat in human form is not just a rat. More generally, conceiving of a being as outwardly human but inwardly subhu man is not just conceiving of that being as a subhuman animal.43 A being that is both human and subhuman transgresses culturally sanc tioned metaphysical categories. It is a contradictory or interstitial being. According to Mary Douglas's celebrated analysis, such beings are re garded as unclean, impure, defiled, and consequently defiling, and pose a threat to any social order founded on metaphysical presumptions about the natural order of things (that is, every social order).44 Although she does not cite it, Douglas's theory of impurity is quite similar to ideas presented in a seminal paper published in 1906 by the German psychiatrist Ernst Jentsch entitled "On the Psychology of the Uncanny."45 "Uncanny" is an imperfect translation of the German unheimlich, a term that does not have ""Alternatively, the appearance of contradiction might be dispelled by the thought that although dehumanizers believe that their targets are subhuman they alieve that they are human. In this paper, I use "belief' in a broad sense to encompass subdoxastic belief-like states. Tamar S. Gendler, "Alief and Belief," Journal of Philosophy 105 (2008): 634-63. 42Goldhagen, Worse Than War, p. 182. 43David Brion Davis aptly remarks that dehumanized people are not seen as subhuman animals. Rather, they are seen as "animalized humans." See The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Emancipation (New York: Alfred A.

Something that is uncanny (in the English language sense) can be odd or inexplicable without being disturbing, but something that is unheimlich is not merely unusual, it is frightening in a distinctive, difFicult-to-describe way. As Freud remarked in his widely cited 1919 essay "The Uncanny," [the uncanny] is undoubtedly related to what is frightening—to what arouses dread and horror ... Yet we may expect that a special core of feeling is present which justifies the use of a special conceptual term. One is curious to know what this common core is which allows us to distinguish as "uncanny" certain things which lie within the field of what is frightening.46 What, exactly, is this special core of feeling? Unheimlich things are creepy, eerie, unsettling, and horrifying. They seem to be imbued with ex traordinary power, exerting an unwelcome but irresistible fascination. One wants to look at them as urgently as one wants desperately to turn away. Jentsch suggests that the cognitive foundation for such responses is a pecu liar experience of disorientation. Most of his examples involve uncertainty about whether an item is animate or inanimate. For instance, he discusses the unpleasant reactions that are elicited by figures in a wax museum (re member, this was written over a century ago). Even though one knows that these are inanimate figures, they are so lifelike that one cannot help re garding them as real people. Jentsch asserts that the uncanny effect is all the more marked when viewing mechanical simulacra of human beings. This peculiar effect makes its appearance even more clearly when imitations of the human form not only reach one's perception, but when on top of everything they appear to be united with certain bodily or mental functions. This is where the impression easily pro duced by the automatic figures belongs that is so awkward for many people. Once again, those cases must here be discounted in which the objects are very small or very familiar in the course of daily usage. A doll which closes and opens its eyes by itself, or a small auto matic toy, will cause no notable sensation of this kind, while on the other hand, for exam ple, the life-size machines that perform complicated tasks, blow trumpets, dance and so forth, very easily give one a feeling of unease.47 The spectator's mind is pulled in two directions at once. She is unable to settle on either of these mutually exclusive alternatives, and simultaneously regards the figures as animate and inanimate. An inability to settle on one interpretation or another produces the unsettling feeling of uncanniness. Jentsch's thesis was resurrected in 1970 by Japanese roboticist Masa hiro Mori, who argued that robots that resemble human beings up to a 46Sigmund Freud, "The 'Uncanny"' [1919], The Standard Edition of the Complete Psy chological Works of Sigmund Freud, Vol. 17 (London: The Hogarth Press and the Institute of Psycho-Analysis, 1955), p. 218. 47Jentsch, "On the Psychology of the Uncanny," p. 12.</page><page sequence="17">432 David Livingstone Smith certain point will elicit positive reactions of familiarity, whereas those that resemble human beings quite closely but are not indistinguishable from human beings will elicit intense feelings of aversion. He called this pre cipitous drop in positive feeling the uncanny valley. Decades later, ad vances in robotics and computer simulation technology have lent support to Mori's intuitions. Not-quite-human robots and computer simulations fall into the uncanny valley.48 Both Douglas and Jentsch are concerned with the significance of enti ties that seem to transgress metaphysical boundaries. Both argue that we experience such entities as peculiarly disturbing—as impure (in Douglas's language) or uncanny (in Jentsch's language). Noël Carroll's work on horror fiction adds flesh to these bones, and implicitly establishes a con nection between impurity and uncanniness. He does not cite Jentsch or Mori, but he expands upon Douglas's analysis of impurity to craft a theory of the monstrous.49 Monsters, as they are presented in horror fiction, are a species of beings defined by their transgression of metaphysical bounda ries. The form of metaphysical category violation that is most pertinent to this discussion is categorical contradictoriness. Horrific monsters often involve the mixture of what is normally distinct. Demonically pos sessed characters typically involve the superimposition of two categorically distinct indi viduals, the possessee and the possessor, the latter is usually a demon who, in turn, is often a categorically transgressive figure (e.g., a goat-god). Stevenson's most famous monster is two men, Jekyll and Hyde, where Hyde is described as having a simian aspect which makes him appear not quite human. Werewolves mix man and wolf, while shape changers of other sorts compound humans with other species.50 Horrific monsters are typically what Carroll calls fusion figures—"a composite that unites attributes held to be categorically distinct and/or at odds with the cultural scheme of things in unambiguously one, spatio-tem porally discrete entity."51 The interstitial character of monsters—their sub version of the metaphysical order—is beautifully captured in a statement from the medieval Book of Monsters of Various Kinds: "Made as they were, the order of creation must keep them on the outside."52 48Masahiro Mori, "The Uncanny Valley," trans. Karl F. MacDorman and Norri Ka geki, IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine 19 (2012): 98-100. 49Noël Carroll, The Philosophy of Horror, or, Paradoxes of the Heart (New York: Routledge, 1990). For Carroll, "monster" signifies a very broad category of beings (includ ing entities such as Superman). His notion of horrific monsters corresponds to our ordinary conception of monsters. I will use "monster" as equivalent to Carroll's "horrific monster," unless indicated otherwise. 50Carroll, ibid., p. 33. 51Ibid„ p. 43. 52Cited in David D. Gilmore, Monsters: Evil Beings, Mythical Beasts, and All Manner of Imaginary Terrors (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2003).</page><page sequence="18">Paradoxes of Dehumanization 433 Categorical transgression, and the uncanniness eventuating from it, is not sufficient for monstrousness. Corpses are often felt to be uncanny, be cause they are seen as both persons and as inanimate objects, but they are not monsters.53 Carroll argues that to be a monster, a being must be both physically and cognitively threatening. Monsters are "threats to common knowledge ... challenges to the foundations of a culture's way of think ing"54 and: They must be dangerous. This can be satisfied simply by making the monster lethal. That it kills and maims is enough. The monster may also be threatening psychologically, morally or socially. It may destroy one's identity ..., seek to destroy the moral order ..., or advance an alternative society. Monsters may also trigger certain enduring infantile fears, such as those of being eaten or dismembered, or sexual fears concerning rape or incest.55 It is clear that his account of contradictory monsters satisfies Jentsch's recipe for the uncanny. This is precisely what one should expect—after all, monsters are paradigms of Unheimlichkeit. The uncanniness of the monster amplifies its physically threatening character, adding metaphysi cal threat to physical, moral, or social danger. A wolf might be threatening, but a werewolf is far more threatening. A serial killer might be threatening, but a serial killer possessed by a demon is more threatening still. Varieties of Dehumanization Monsters are fictional, but they are often fictionalizations of real people. It is common for dehumanized people to be explicitly represented as mon sters, or described in terms that capture their monstrous character. Con sider the following characterization of Jews excerpted from Der Unter mensch ("The Subhuman") a fifty-page antisemitic booklet published in 1942 under the editorial supervision of Heinrich Himmler. Inside of this creature lies wild and unrestrained passions: an incessant need to destroy, filled with the most primitive desires, chaos and coldhearted villainy ... The subhuman thrives in chaos and darkness, he is frightened by the light. These subhuman creatures dwell in the cesspools, and swamps, preferring a hell on earth, to the light of the sun.56 I propose that referring to dehumanized people as monsters is not a rhe torical flourish. It reflects something important about the folk-metaphysics "Pascal Boyer, Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought (New York: Basic Books, 2002). 54Carroll, The Philosophy of Horror, p. 34.

In standard Jentsch-Mori cases, the aura of uncanniness is elicited by contradictory perceptual information: one observes attributes of a single item belonging to disparate, incompatible natural kinds. Figures in a wax museum, mechanical dolls, or imperfect computer simulations of human beings seem uncanny because they look both human and nonhuman. This happens because we normally rely on similarity-based judgments when categorizing things. For the most part, we classify an item as a member of kind K if it has the stereotypical, casually observable attributes associated with K. We do this because these attributes are normally reliably indicative of K-membership (if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it is very probably a duck). But such judgments can be overridden. Sometimes we judge that an item is not a member of K even though it has the casually observable attributes stereotypically associated with K. Sometimes this is motivated by theoretical considerations (although the ring looks like it is made of silver, you test its specific gravity and conclude that the ring is made of platinum) and sometimes it is based on expert testimony (a chemist tells you that it is made of platinum). In standard Jentsch-Mori cases, the uncanny item is observed to possess observable attributes that are stereo typically associated with, and reliably indicative of K as well as attributes stereotypically associated with and reliably indicative of not-K. This has the effect of pulling the mind in two directions at once, and inclining one to assign one and the same item to two incompatible categories. There is an important difference between the psychological processes that underpin Jentsch-Mori cases and those at work in episodes of dehu manization (although there can also be forms of dehumanization that more closely approximate the former; see my discussion of the dehumanization of disabled people below). In Jentsch-Mori cases, the inability to classify the uncanny item is driven by contradictory perceptual cues. But in cases of dehumanization, the uncanny effect produced is a contradiction be tween a thing's appearance and the essence that one has attributed to it.57 Typically it is the dehumanized person's appearance that leads one to clas sify her as a human being, and it is the nonperceptual belief that she is a subhuman creature—normally acquired by political propaganda or en trenched ideological biases—that draws one's mind in the opposite direc tion. The dehumanized person is consequently felt to be both human and subhuman—and therefore as an uncanny entity. Paradoxically, then, part of what makes such dehumanized people so loathsome and menacing is "Jentsch ("On the Psychology of the Uncanny") gives a rather odd example of the uncanny effect of a theoretical judgment competing with a perceptual judgment—the dis orienting effect of learning that Earth revolves around the Sun, which conflicts with the perceptual experience of the sun rising and setting.</page><page sequence="20">Paradoxes of Dehumanization 435 their seeming humanity. This analysis invites a question and possibly an objection. Compare the example of a ring that looks as though it is made of silver, but which—on the authority of a chemist—turns out to be platinum with the example of a Jew who looks human, but who—on the authority of a Nazi race expert— is classified as vermin. In the first case it is easy to relinquish the view that the ring was made of silver in favor of the view that it is made of platinum. One's mind does not hover between the two and consequently one does not experience the ring as uncanny. But things turn out quite differently in the second example. An awareness of the Jew's humanity coexists with its denial, thus rendering him uncanny. What accounts for the disparity? The difference may be a function of what might be called the "metaphysical distance" between the two kinds in each case. The categories "silver" and "platinum" are intuitively closer to one another—less irreconcilable— than the categories "human" and "vermin" are. Silver and platinum are more or less indistinguishable to the untrained eye, but the same cannot be said about Jews and vermin. The other, arguably more important, part of the answer pertains to the psychological salience of the category "human." Like all social animals, members of Homo sapiens are primed for recog nizing other members of their own kind. But we are not merely social— we are hypersocial,58 Consequently, we are exquisitely sensitive to cues indicating that others are members of our own species. This is evidenced by research showing that even very young infants have a visual preference for the human face, as well as by research showing that the human brain contains wetware specifically dedicated to processing perceptions of hu man faces. The extraordinary psychological salience of human faces in our perceptual world may explain our tendency to see human faces where none exist (to see "faces in the clouds" or the visage of Jesus on pieces of burnt toast).591 suggest that it is because humanity is so salient to us that, even when one embraces the idea that the other is a subhuman creature, it is hard to suppress the awareness that she is human. If I am right, then, it is— paradoxically—our hypersocial nature that is responsible for our turning others into monsters. Nothing about this account requires that dehumanizers explicitly re gard their victims as subhuman while implicitly regarding them as human. 58Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Un derstanding (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2009). 5901ivier Pascalis and Alan Slater (eds.), The Development of Face Processing in In fancy and Early Childhood: Current Perspectives (Haupauge, N.Y.: Nova Science Pub lishers, 2003); Doris Y.

Explicit assertions that one or another group of people is less than human are neither necessary nor sufficient for dehu manization, and are probably characteristic of only the most blatant exam ples, such as Nazi propaganda. Tacitly categorizing others as subhuman is presumably far more common. Explanatory Gains At this point, it may be useful to briefly recap the theory of dehumaniza tion that I have presented so far. (1) Dehumanization is prompted by ambivalence—the coexistence of a desire to harm others with inhibitions against harming them. (2) Dehumanization occurs when one attributes to human beings the essence of a dangerous or repulsive subhuman kind. Doing this disables inhibitions against harming or killing them, and may also motivate harm ing or killing them. (3) However, because it is difficult not to classify other humans as hu mans, when we dehumanize others we tend to see them as simultaneously human and subhuman—and therefore as impure (Douglas), uncanny (Jentsch), and monstrous (Carroll). This is an unintended consequence of the dehumanizing process. This account of dehumanization provides a plausible response to the im portant challenge posed by Manne, Appiah, Gopnik, and Godwyn. Once we recognize that dehumanized people are conceived not simply as sub human animals but rather as human/subhuman chimeras, their dehuman izers' implicit affirmation of their humanity no longer seems so puzzling. On this account, it is the undesired but nevertheless persistent awareness of the dehumanized person's humanity—the relentless return of her re pressed moral and metaphysical status—that lends a certain kind of dehu manization its distinctive character. I now want to delve more deeply into what this distinctive character consists in by discussing three further ex planatory advantages of the picture that I have so far presented. Dehumanizers often describe those whom they dehumanize as partially or "not fully" human. Consider remarks in Der Untermensch. Although it characterizes Jews as subhumans, the text also asserts that "The subhuman is a biological creature, crafted by nature, which has hands, legs, eyes and mouth, even the semblance of a brain. Nevertheless, this terrible creature</page><page sequence="22">Paradoxes of Dehumanization 437 is only a partial human being."60 Presumably, the authors meant to say that that the Untermensch has human-looking hands, legs, eyes, and so on, otherwise the clause beginning "nevertheless" would not make sense. But elsewhere in the text the authors make it clear that the Untermensch is not human at all—for example, when they assert, apropos of the Untermensch, that "Not all of those, who appear human are in fact so. Woe to him who forgets it!" The seeming incoherency of the text may reflect the incoher ency of the dehumanizers' representation of that person as partially human (in virtue of being uncannily both human and subhuman) and as totally subhuman (in virtue of being a monster). Second, this account may throw light on why it is that dehumanized peo ple are so often thought of as superpredators.61 Dehumanized people are often believed to possess superhuman powers that are used for destructive, evil ends, which is why this form of dehumanization is sometimes called "demonization."62 What may be the first published reference to dehuman ization as a psychological phenomenon mentions this aspect of it. David Hume observes in the Treatise of Human Nature that "[i]f the general of our enemies be successful, 'tis with difficulty we allow him the figure and character of a man. He is a sorcerer: He is in communication with daemons ... He is bloody-minded, and takes pleasure in death and destruction."63 Likewise, in Der Untermensch (as well as much other Nazi propaganda), Jews are presented as a uniquely formidable and destructive enemy. As long as there have been men on the earth, the struggle between man and the subhuman will be the historic rule; the Jewish-led struggle against the mankind, as far back as we can look, is part of the natural course of life on our planet. One can be convinced with full certainty that this struggle for life and death is just as much a law of nature as is the struggle of an infection to corrupt a healthy body.64 Psychologists Adam Waytz, Kelly Marie Hoffman, and Sophie Trawalter published research suggesting that white Americans often dehu manize black people by attributing greater-than-human powers to them, a phenomenon that they call "superhumanization."65 Soon after the electronic 60Himmler, Der Untermensch (italics added). 61A term coined by John Dilulio to denote (primarily black) extremely violent juvenile criminals. Even Dilulio eventually came to regard this as a dehumanizing label. See Rich ard Morin, "Leading With His Right," The Washington Post, 26 February 2001, https:// www.washingtonpost.eom/archive/lifestyle/2001/02/26/leading-with-his-right/17663all 1 ddb-43f8-99d2-eeb4651 af5d2/. 62Demons are characteristically thought to combine human and subhuman attributes. They are horrific monsters, in Carroll's sense. 63David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, ed. David Fate Norton and Mary J. Norton (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 225 (II.ii.3). ^Himmler, Der Untermensch. 65Adam Waytz, Kelly Marie Hoffman, and Sophie Trawalter, "A Superhumanization</page><page sequence="23">438 David Livingstone Smith version of their paper was published in October 2014, they contributed an article to the Washington Post arguing that this form of dehumanization was evident in Darren Wilson's account of the confrontation that led to his fatal shooting of Michael Brown. Wilson told the Grand Jury: The only way I can describe it, it looks like a demon, how angry he looked ... He turns, and when he looked at me, he made like a grunting, like aggravated sound and he starts, he turns and he's coming back towards me ... At this point it looked like he was almost bulk ing up to run through the shots, like it was making him mad that I'm shooting at him. And the face that he had was looking straight through me, like 1 wasn't even there, I wasn't even anything in his way.66 Waytz, Hoffman, and Trawalter comment that "Although unclear whe ther Wilson's 'it' refers to Brown's facial expression, or Brown himself, the use of the term, 'demon', both sub-humanizes and super-humanizes Brown, clearly casting him outside of humanity."67 The attribution of su perhuman attributes to black people by white Americans—including in sensitivity to pain, superhuman strength, and superhuman sexual appe tites—has gone hand-in-hand with their dehumanization at least since the end of Reconstruction, and is embodied in the iconic racist image of King Kong.68 Even though dehumanized people are often the most vulnerable members of a society, they are thought to possess powers that far outstrip their physical capabilities (this is even thought to be true of infants and the elderly). There is something about their very being that is threatening. Car roll's work shows that this is also often a peculiarity of fictional monsters. He points out that Douglas's theory of impurity "might help to answer a frequent puzzle about horror." It is a remarkable fact about creatures of horror that they do not seem to be of sufficient strength to make a grown man cower. A teetering zombie or a severed hand would appear incapable of mustering enough force to overpower a co-ordinated six-year-old. Neverthe less they are presented as unstoppable, and this seems psychologically acceptable to audi ences. This might be explained by noting Douglas' claim that culturally impure objects are generally taken to be invested with magical powers ... Monsters in works of horror, by ex tension, then, may be similarly imbued with awesome powers in virtue of their impurity.69 Bias in Whites' Perceptions of Blacks," Social Psychological and Personality Science 6 (2015): 352-59. 66Quoted in Adam Waytz, Kelly Marie Hoffman, and Sophie Trawalter, "The Racial Bias Embedded in Darren Wilson's Testimony," The Washington Post, 26 November 2014. 67See ibid. The authors go on to remark that in one of their studies, "whites were par ticularly adept processing a set of words including Wilson's depiction, demon, when a black face appeared on the computer screen just before." 68See Fatimah Tobing Rony, "King Kong and the Monster in Ethnographic Cinema," in The Third Eye: Race, Cinema, and Ethnographic Spectacle (Durham: Duke University Press, 1996), chap. 6. 69Carroll, The Philosophy of Horror, p. 34.</page><page sequence="24">Paradoxes of Dehumanization 439 Finally, the analysis that I have presented may throw light on the prac tice of reviling and degrading dehumanized people by asserting that they are animals. One doesn't rub a rat's nose in the fact that it's a rat, or put a rat "in its place," but it is quite frequently the case that dehumanizers treat their victims in precisely that way. It is tempting to think of this treatment as nothing but an attempt to put the victim in her place—that is, her social place—by degrading and humiliating her. This makes sense of dehuman izers' stating to their victims that they are monkeys, pigs, or vermin. But it is less apparent why dehumanizers should make such claims about their victims to one another. I suggest that in making such assertions, dehuman izers may be striving to put those whom they have dehumanized in their metaphysical place as well as their social place. Asserting that she is just an animal may have the aim of stripping her of her uncanniness—trans forming her from being a monster into a being relatively innocuous crea ture, a vermin rather than a demon—and thereby attempting to relieve the perpetrator of his painful cognitive dissonance. I have concentrated on a variety of dehumanization in which the dehu manized other is thought to have the essence of some kind of threatening animal. The animal may be regarded threatening because it is predatory, venomous, disease-carrying, or aggressive, and the threat that this animal presents is then amplified by the uncanniness of the dehumanized person so as to render that person monstrous or demonic. Call this demonizing dehumanization. But this is not the only mold into which dehumanization is cast. Sometimes, dehumanized people are pictured as domestic live stock, or trained animals (for example, monkeys), or animals to be hunted for sport. Call this enfeebling dehumanization,70 In enfeebling cases, Car roll's formula for making a monster—dangerousness plus impurity—is not satisfied. Such people are not conceived of as monsters, but are none theless regarded as uncanny. Although they are not thought of as physi cally dangerous, they are nevertheless felt to be metaphysically disturbing. It might be objected that the dehumanization of women does not satisfy this criterion, because men who dehumanize women in this way do not regard them as metaphysically threatening. Recall that the term "dehuman ization" is used in (at least) eight distinct ways in the scholarly literature, and that I restrict "dehumanization" to only one of these. When dehuman ized, women qua women tend not to be excluded from the category of the human. They are more often regarded as defective, primitive, incomplete, or deformed human beings and are therefore relegated to an inferior rank within the human category. Similar considerations apply in those cases of racist beliefs that fall short of dehumanization.71 70Thanks to Sasha Smith for suggesting this term. 71Highly elaborated versions of the Great Chain of Being described hierarchies within</page><page sequence="25">440 David Livingstone Smith In addition to the demonizing and enfeebling forms, there is also a third kind of dehumanization (or, at least, something very much like dehuman ization). Consider the dehumanization of people with certain kinds of dis ability or disfigurement, such that they are regarded as not having a stereo typically human appearance or not behaving in stereotypically human ways. Such a person might display both stereotypically human attributes and at tributes that are not regarded as stereotypically human (this would be something like a Jentsch-Mori case). Alternatively, there might be an in version of the relation between essence and appearance that is character istic of the other forms of dehumanization. The appearance of the disabled or disfigured person might cognitively compete with an awareness of her humanity. In both cases, one would expect, on theoretical grounds, that such people will often be experienced as metaphysically threatening but not phys ically dangerous—repugnant and unsettling, but not evil and demonic. From Representation to Action I have emphasized the representational dimensions of dehumanization. But dehumanized populations are not just represented as such; they are also treated as such. A range of social practices, some of them ad hoc and others enshrined in tradition, are brought to bear on dehumanized popula tions. In this section, I will briefly address this topic by way of Douglas's taxonomy of the methods used by traditional societies to manage ritually impure items. Douglas considers five ways of managing "aberrant forms." Each of these is pertinent to ways in which dehumanized people are char acteristically treated. The first method that she mentions is to try to eliminate the contradic tory character of the aberrant item, so that it fits an accepted metaphysical category. For example, because the birth of deformed infants may subvert the distinction between human beings and nonhuman animals, "the Nuer treat monstrous births as baby hippopotamuses, accidentally born to hu mans and, with this labelling, the appropriate action is clear. They gently lay them in the river where they belong."72 I have already suggested that putting dehumanized people in their (meta physical) place by representing them as nothing more than animals may have this function, but I have not emphasized that such depictions are linked to practices that have the aim of animalizing them. Such practices categories as well as between them. During the eighteenth century, the category of the human was divided into ranked races. European men modestly situated themselves at its apex, just below the angels, and placed Africans and Native Americans at the bottom, just above the apes. For examples, see Smith, Less Than Human. 72Douglas, Purity and Danger, p. 49.</page><page sequence="26">Paradoxes of Dehumanization 441 were common features of North American slavery. Mia Bay observes that former slaves recalled "being fed like pigs, bred like hogs, sold like horses, driven like cattle, worked like dogs, and beaten like mules."73 Likewise, David Brion Davis points out that: [T]he ex-slaves in numerous Southern states repeatedly remembered that like animals they did not know their age or birthdays and as children often even ate like and with the animals: "Dey was a trough out in de yard [where] dey poured de mush and milk in[,] an us chillum an de dogs would all crowd 'roun it and eat together ... we sho' had to be in a hurry 'bout it cause de dogs would get it all if we didn't." "The white folks et the white flour and the niggers et the shorts," one woman reported, and "the hogs was also fed the shorts."74 Another approach is to exercise control over the offending item. In some cultures, night-crowing cocks are regarded as anomalous. "If their necks are promptly wrung," Douglas comments, "they do not live to con tradict the definition of a cock as a bird that crows at dawn."75 Consider in this connection the ubiquitous practice of confining dehumanized people to certain areas, restricting intermarriage with them, enforcing rules for bidding direct or indirect contact with them, restricting where they can go, whom they can speak with, and what they can wear, imprisoning them, and, of course, exterminating them. If the monstrousness of dehumanized people magnifies their physical dangerousness, their impurity—and hence the power to pollute on contact—renders them even more threatening. They are contaminating, transmitters of pollution, and therefore must be quarantined or exterminated. As Hitler remarked: The discovery of the Jewish virus is one of the greatest revolutions that has taken place in the world. The battle in which we are engaged today is the same sort as the battle waged during the last century by Pasteur and Koch. How many diseases have their origins in the Jewish virus! We shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jew.76 Yet another practice is to label the anomalous item as a source of dan ger. The function of labeling in dehumanizing discourse is not straightfor ward, because labeling others as dangerous (physically or metaphysically) occupies more than one role (it is both constitutive of the dehumanizing process and a tool for managing those thus dehumanized), and may vary from case to case. In cases of enfeebling dehumanization, as well as the dehumanization of disabled persons, attributions of (metaphysical) danger ousness only enter the picture once they have become dehumanized, whereas in cases of demonizing dehumanization, there are attributions of 73Bay, The White Image in the Black Mind, p. 119. 74Davis, The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Emancipation, p. 10. 75Douglas, Purity and Danger, p. 49. 76H.R.

Perhaps the most that can be said of a general nature at this point is that the use of such labeling is complex and multilayered, and that it needs to be studied on a case-by-case basis.77 Finally, Douglas mentions that anomalous items can be mastered by their being incorporated into religiously infused, ritual practices. A strik ing example of the treatment of dehumanized people in this manner is suggested by Orlando Patterson's account of lynching as human sacrifice. Patterson argues that public lynching in the American South had many of the characteristics associated with ritual human sacrifice. Consider the ceremonial character of the 1899 lynching, in Paris, Texas, of Henry Smith, a black man who was accused of murdering the daughter of a policeman who had assaulted him, in what a local clergyman described as "the mad wantonness of gorilla frenzy." According to one eye-witness account, [t]he Negro was placed upon a carnival float in mockery of a king upon his throne, and, followed by an immense crowd, was escorted through the city so that all might see the most inhuman monster known in human history. ... His clothes were torn off piecemeal and scattered in the crowd, people catching the shreds and putting them away as mementos. The child's father, her brother, and two uncles then gathered about the Negro as he lay fastened to the torture platform and thrust hot irons into his quivering flesh.... Every groan from the fiend, every contortion of his body was cheered by the thickly packed crowd of 10,000 persons ... After burning the feet and legs, the hot irons ... were rolled up and down Smith's stomach, back and arms. Then the eyes were burned out and the irons were thrust down his throat.78 Parts of the victims' bodies were often taken as relics. Another account, quoted by Patterson, describes how "the Negro was deprived of his ears, fingers, and other portions of his body ... Before the body was cool, it was cut to pieces, the bones were crushed into small bits and even the tree upon which the wretch met his fate was torn up and disposed of as souvenirs."79 Patterson also argues that these festivities had cannibalistic overtones. They were often referred to as "barbecues" and the onlookers imbibed the smell of their sacrificial victims' roasting flesh. 77Lynne Tirrell's detailed study of the role of language in the 1994 Rwanda genocide contains a wealth of insights into how such labeling works: see "Genocidal Language Games," in Ishani Maitra and Mary Kate McGowan (eds.), Speech and Harm: Controver sies over Free Speech (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 174-221. 78Cited in Orlando Patterson, Rituals of Blood: Consequences of Slavery in Two Amer ican Centuries (New York: Basic Civitas, 1998), p. 193. 79Ibid., pp. 194-95.</page><page sequence="28">Paradoxes of Dehumanization 443 Conclusion Dehumanization is a topic with wide-ranging ramifications. An accurate analysis of it will impact our understanding of moral psychology, racism, war, genocide, our relations to nonhuman animals, implicit biases, and the psychological dispositions that underpin philosophical intuitions about natural kinds and essences, and may have implications for public policy. A complete theory of dehumanization must, it seems, address the political forces that determine the content of dehumanizing representations as well as the psychological forces that determine the form of dehumanizing thinking. I have for the most part confined my efforts to the psychological sphere, and a great deal of work remains to be done explaining exactly how these psychological dynamics mesh with the political ones. I have drawn on a range of converging theoretical considerations taken from anthropology (Douglas), psychology (Jentsch), robotics (Mori), and aes thetics (Carroll) to fashion a theory that addresses the problem presented by the tacit humanization of dehumanized people that also has resources to explain hitherto neglected aspects of the phenomenology of dehumani zation. This may not be the best account of the psychology of dehumanization, but it is the best story that I have been able to come up with having inves tigated the phenomenon for the greater part of a decade. I hope that it will inspire others to do better. Department of History and Philosophy, University of New England dsmith@une.edu</page></plain_text>
