<plain_text><page sequence="1">Farming Sites of the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages in Southern Tajikistan by Natalia M. Vinogradova and GlOVANNA lombardo The territory of South Tajikistan, ancient Bactria in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages is in the focus of the present study. The excavations of the South Tajik archaeological expedition headed by B.A. Litvinsky made it possible to trace the continuous progress of Archaeological culture from the Neolithic Age to the Early Iron Age in this region. At present there are more than 300 monuments of the Hissar neolithic culture, the earlier date of the Hissar culture is determined by radiocarbon analysis of the second horizon of the settlement of Tutkaul as 6070?70 B.C. (according to St. Peterburg laboratory) (Ranov 1982: 26) 5150+140 B.C. or 4810?110 B.C. All the earliest three dates for the Hissar culture belong to the 6th 5th millennium B.C. The lower limit of the Hissar culture monuments is determined by radiocarbon date for the Hissar layers of Kangurttut settlement is 2710?120 B.C. (Ranov 1998: 107). In V.A. Ranov's opinion the Hissar culture in the mountain areas of South Tajikistan existed till the coming of new tribes of the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C. of the Bronze Age (Ranov 1982: 26) (x). Some archaeological culture of the Late Bronze Age can be singled out on the territory of South Tajikistan. They are farming type monuments of the North Bactrian variant of the Namazga VI culture and of the steppe cultures - the Vakhsh and Beshkent cultures. There can be observed an infiltration of the Northern steppe tribes of the Andronovo type in Southern Tajikistan. The genesis of farming settlements and graveyards of the North-Bactrian variant of the Namazga VI culture on the territory of Southern Tajikistan is connected with the monuments of Southern Uzbekistan, the so called Sapalli culture at its latest phases, Molali and Bustan (Fig. 1). Nowadays the way of infiltration of this culture into the territory of South Tajikistan can be traced: via the Surkhan Darja valley into the Hissar valley and the upper reaches of the Vakhsh valley to Parkharo Kuliabskaya valley. The reasons for the migration of farming population to the North-east of mountain valleys of Southern Tajikistan could be of ecological (x) In Southern Tajikistan has not been found out any archaeological evidence filling up a cultural gap, if it had existed, between the pre-ceramic Hissar late Stone Age and the monuments of the late Bronze Age. [1] 71</page><page sequence="2">(aridity), demographic and economic character (population increase, need for occupation of new lands and pastures, trade contacts). It should be emphasized that there are different names for Margiana-Bactrian monuments of the late Namazga VI culture. These are the Oxus culture (Francfort 1984: 170-75), the Namazga culture (Kohl 1981), the Sapalli culture (Askarov 1977: 5), Bactrian-Margiana archaeological complex (BMAC - Sarianidi 1990). We think it is possible to retain the name of Namazga VI culture assuming that there are several local chronological variants and thus, the definition of North Bactrian variant of this culture can be attributed to monuments of Southern Tajikistan. The chronology of the Namazga VI is still debatable between the archaeological school of scholars of the former USSR on the one hand and of the European and American scholars on the other. The former place them in the middle and in the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C. (Sarianidi 1990: 74; Askarov &amp; Shirinov 1993: 81; P'jankova 1986: 56-58; Vinogradova 1994: 42; Khlopin 1983: 57) which corresponds to the traditional chronology of Eurasian steppe culture (Itina 1977: 139; Kuzmina 1985: 24; Zdanovich 1988: 8). The European and American schools accept the calibrated radiocarbon dates (Lyonnet 1993: 195; Hiebert 1994: 77; Francfort 1989: 242; Goetzelt 1996: 135, 157) and place them in the first half of the 2nd millennium B.C. (2). These dates in their turn correspond to the calibrated dates for steppe cultures (Kuzmina 1998: 5). According to E.E. Kuzmina, at present it is correct to use either a traditional method of syncronization with cultures of Europe, Ancient East and China or a radiocarbon method. The farming tribes under the study are located on the northern outskirts of the Bactrian civilization. Their archaeological complexes are represented by quite 'poor' finds but they are very important in understanding the historical processes which took place in the late 2nd millennium B.C. The farming tribes come into close contacts with the population of the steppe cultures - the Andronovo people and the Beshkent-Vakhsh tribes (Vinogradova 1993: 19). In Southern Tajikistan of the late Bronze Age there were several agricultural oases situated in loess foothills and semi-montaneous zones which were good for both farming and cattle breeding. Atmospheric precipitations were a contributory factor for dry farming. The foothill of the plain was good for irrigation. Tributaries of mountain rivers were the main source of water. In the last two decades the South Tajik archaelogical expedition has discovered a number of farming settlements and cemeteries of the North-Bactrian variant of the Namazga VI culture (the settlements of Kangurttut. Dakhana, Teguzak, Baraki Kurug; the cemeteries of Tandyriul, Zar Kamar, Kangurttut, Parkhar) and Yaz I culture (the settlements of Karim Berdy, Kangurttut - the upper horizon, Teguzak - the upper horizon) (Fig. 1). (2) Table 1 shows the main C14 dates for Namazga V-VI monuments but here a strong incoherence of dates should be taken in consideration. Thus, for example, C14 dates for a final layer of Namazga VI at Namazga settlement itself vary from 1884 B.C. to 818 B.C. (Hiebert 1994: 82, table 5, 4). 72 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1 - The map of the sites. Fig. 2 - The general view of the site of Kangurttut. [3] 73</page><page sequence="4">The spore-pollen analysis of the loess soil of the settlement of Kangurttut allows to reconstruct the paleogeographic situation in the neolithic and late Bronze periods in the south of Tajikistan. In the lower layer of the settlement belonging to the Hissar neolithic period E.A. Spiridonova singles out the pollen of wood species - birch (13% from the general composition). Herbaceous plants make up 69-70% and spores where green moss prevails are 17-18%. The spectrum composition evidences warm and humid climate. The spore-pollen complexes from the horizons of Kangurttut of the Bronze Age differ from the previous neolithic complex. 95% in the spectrum belongs to the pollen of the herbaceous plants and shrubs. The pollen of the wood species is practically lacking. Steppe plants are abundant in the vegetable top-soil. This fact points out the aridity of climate in the late Bronze period as compared with the Hissar neolithic period. The location of farming sites of Southern Tajikistan evidences their oasis type. At present three farming oasis can be singled out: the Hissar valley, the valleys of the upper reaches of the river Vakhsh, in the area of Nurek and Kangurttut, and the Kulyab valley along the rivers Kyzylsu and Yakhsu. In the Shaartuz district of the lower reaches of the Kafirnigan some chance findings have occurred. The Hissar Valley In the Hissar Valley oasis two ancient graveyards of the farming culture are known, Tandyriul and Zar-Kamar. Some burials are known in the monuments of the Kushana Period in Tupkhona (Dyakonov 1950: 167, 176) and Kara-Pichok (Vinogradova &amp; P'jankova 1983: 62). The materials of a farming settlement were discovered by P.T. Samoilik in the lower stratigraphic layers of Hissar fortress (3). The cemetery of Tandyriul (Vinogradova 1991: 68) was revealed on the second terrace of the left bank of the river Karatag, near the 'kishlak' of Negmad-Bacha II in Tursundaevsky region. There was no settlement related to the cemetery in the vicinity (4). The cemetery covers the area of 300 x 500 m; 34 graves were dug. The burial had a 'podboino'-catacomb construction which was marked by an entrance pit filled with stones (Vinogradova 1991: 80). There were graves in simple pits. The method of burying was inhumation or fractional burial. The latter are quite few. The skeletons were set in a contracted position - men on their right side and women on their left side - with the head oriented North-eastward or South-eastward. There occurred cenotaphs with anthropomorphic images - grave no. 2 (Fig. 3). Some burials had charcoals remains and burnt skeleton bones on the bottom. In terms of (3) P.T. Samolik's excavations are not published. (4) The settlement could have been destroyed during the work of levelling the ground. The peculiarity of South Tajik monuments is a lack of the 'Depe' (the hill formed by the ancient remains) as an outward attribute of the settlement. 74 [4]</page><page sequence="5">5 I0 a 0 Fig. 3 - The necropolis of Tandlyriul.

The burials contained some pots and vessels (Fig. 5), miniature metal objects (5), ornaments made of stones and metal (Figs. 7-8), sculptural representations made of unbaked clay - a man (Fig. 3.1) and a lion (Fig. 9). Two finds revealed in the ruined burials are of interest: a stone column and a weight (Fig. 4.1, 2). The material presented here (Figs. 5, 7-9) is typical of the monuments of the Sapalli farming culture of the Molali and Bustan phases (Askarov 1977: fig. 32; Avanesova 1997: 147) with the exception of one grave (no. 25) with funeral furnishings containing the vessel with cannelures and bronze objects analogous to those from the monuments of the Andronovo culture (Fig. 6; Vinogradova 1991: 76 77). In addition to Molali pottery some burials contain vessels which are typical of the Beshkent-Vakhsh culture: handmade round based vessels and the so called biconical vessels (Fig. 5.18-25). (5) A large percentage of tin (14%) is noteworthy (Vinogradova 1991: 85-86). 76 [6]</page><page sequence="7">0\ o 2 3 0 20 12 9 227KI2EB . 24 5 Fig. 5 - The necropolis of Tandyriul. Pottery shapes.

Among the occasional finds in mountain areas of this region worth of mention are copper axes discovered in the village of Arakchin, not far from Varzob and Sharshar, to the south of Dushanbe (Fig. 27.4, 5) (Kuzmina 1966: 8, 19). A bronze dagger of Luristan-Caucasian type comes from the village of Ramit, not far from Dushanbe (Fig. 27.6) There are some finds of Molali pottery found in destroyed burials not far from Dushanbe and a bronze mirror with a handle discovered in the 'kishlak' of Kara Pichok of Hissar region (Fig. 27.3). The Upper Reaches of the Vakhsh Valley In the upper reaches of the Vakhsh valley several settlements are known, namely Kangurttut, Dakhana, Teguzak, Baraki-Kurug and Nurek cemeteries. Kangurttut has been excavated for several years (Vinogradova 1987: 76; 1994, 1996). The excavated cemetery was situated in the mountain valley not far from the 'kishlak' of Kangurttut in the Dangarinsy region (district). The settlement covered an area of 500 x 300 m (Figs. 2, 10). The thickness of the cultural layer is 0.5 to 2.5 m. There are two stratigraphic stages in building the settlement. In some cases under the Bronze Age stratum there was the neolithic stratum of the Hissar culture. There is no gap between the layers but the Bronze Age layer does not contain Hissar pebble tools and grounds out of small stones which is typical of the Hissar culture. This archaeological evidence contradicts the hypothesis of Ranov about the Hissar neolithic culture existing as long as the Bronze Age. We think that the Hissar culture discontinued existing in the 3rd millennium B.C. and was replaced much later, perhaps in the Middle Bronze Age (the finding of copper axes), by the farming culture. The architecture was typical of mountain areas. Houses on terraces and stone based walls were excavated (Fig. 11). Houses have large yards with household pits. According to architect N. Baimadova the present lay-out of one of the rooms (area II, Fig. IIa) is very close to that of the so called 'avain' dwelling house which is traditional in many regions of Central Asia.

The elongated proportion is common for such houses where half open middle part is, as a rule, a room giving access into other two side rooms with a roof. Household rooms, hearths, kilns, storage pits for keeping grain were found. Kilns were discovered on the outskirts of the settlement (area la, XI). The pottery can be divided into three groups: wheel-thrown pottery of Molali-Bustan type (53%) (Fig. 12), handmade pottery (46,5%), the so-called 'steppe' cliche [9]</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 8 - The necropolis of Tandyriul. Small finds made of metal, stone and paste. ornamented Andronovo ware (0,2%) (Fig. 13) (6). Some specimen occurred of handmade, round-based pottery which is typical of the Beshkent-Vakhsh culture. Bronze finds comprised knives-sickles, two-edged daggers, awls, buttons etc. (Fig. 15.3-14). There were some findings of casting moulds (Fig. 15.2-2). They differed in the increased tin content (5%) and were similar to those from the Late Bronze Age Andronovo monuments (7). Some object were represented by pestles, balls, grain - graiters (Fig. 17) (8), as well as spindle whorls (Fig. 14), anthropomorphic and zoomorphic clay figurines (Fig. 16). Barley (Hordeum vulgare-, Hordeum vulgare nudum), wheat {Triticum aestivum, Triticum dicoccum), millet (Panicum miliaceum) and flax (Linum usitatissimum) were also traced. 36% in osteological material constituted cattle (Bos taurus); 52,3% - goats and sheep (Ovis and Capra), 9,8% - horse (Equus caballus), 1,9% - donkey (Equus asinus) (9). In the upper layers of the settlement there was found Yaz I type pottery. This allowed us to date the upper limit of the Bronze Age monument existence back to the very late 2nd-early 1st millennium B.C. (Vinogradova 1994: fig. 4.16-19). The cemetery of Kangurttut is situated 200 m South-west of a settlement on a high slope (Vinogradova 1996: 171; here Fig. 2 in the upper part, on the right). The (6) The percentage in the groups of pottery is given according to one of the areas (Area VI). (7) The analyses were carried out in a laboratory by J. Ravic (Moscow).

Antipina. 80 [10]</page><page sequence="11">cemetery was deserted by the inhabitants of the ancient settlement. 91 graves were discovered (Fig. 18). All of them, with some exceptions, were cenotaphs containing burial furnishing. There can be observed a certain similarity in the appearance and type of burial structure (Fig. 21.1). The burials were marked with stones on the ancient surface. All the burials were of 'podboino'-catacomb type; in some cases the grave entrance pits were filled with large pieces of clay. The burial chamber was always turned to the slope elevation. In some burials with skeletons, these were set in a contracted position. One burial (no. 53) contained a male inhumation (Fig. 20). The dead man was on his right side facing the grave entrance. There was an animal jaw beside the skull. The burial furnishings included 7 wheel-thrown vessel and some miniature metal knives. Some burials with disconnected skeletons were uncovered: the skull, long-boned arms and legs were placed in the burial. All burials were adult inhumations of European mediterranean type (according to TP. Kijatkina 1987). In some cases anthropomorphic clay figurines (unburnt clay) or clay pieces were placed into the burial instead of a dead person (Figs. 21-24). Sometimes a burial chamber had a special place left free for the inhumation (Fig. 23). Burial furnishing comprized miniature bronze objects (a mirror, knife-razor, axe-adze and a small bronze cup) (Fig. 26). Animal bones also occurred. The burial finds can be compared with those from the settlement: all pottery with the exception of some vessels was wheel-thrown, similar to that from Molali-Bustan monuments of the Sapalli culture (Fig. 25) (10). Two burials from the settlement are of special interest. In Area XI two Late Bronze Age fractional graves were found in desolate kilns. The kiln (no. 3, Fig. 19) was first carefully cleared from fragments of the dome. The skull of a man lay in the centre of the chamber. A pile of long bones of legs lay South-west of the skull. On the botton were found a flat stone and a badly preserved stem fragment of a bowl of the Molali-Bustan type pottery. Numerous bones of a lamb and cattle were cleared. According to L.T. Yablonsky the skull belonged to a 17-30 year-old woman. L.T. Yablonsky correlates the skull from Kangurttut with an anthropological series of skulls of the Tazabagyabskaya culture in the lower reaches of the Amudaria and the Andronovo people of East Kazakhstan. In his opinion it demonstrates racial-genetic contacts between the steppe population and that of the South of Central Asia in the Late Bronze Age (11). The other kiln (no. 4) was also used as a funeral chamber. Some fragments of a 35-45 year old man were cleared (12). The analysis of the collagen of the bone remains was carried out by Prof. L.D. Sulerjitsky in the laboratory of geochemical (10) One burial contains the Vakhsh pottery (burial no. 69). (n) L.T. Yablonsky's article 'A Skull of a Man from Kangurttut' (not published).

(13). The settlement of Dakhana (P'jankova 1994a: 151; 1998: 163) is located on the territory of the town of Nurek. The cultural Bronze Age layer constitutes 0.5 to 1 m. The construction remains were represented by stone based walls of 2-3 wide rows of stones. Sometimes the floor was covered with pebbles. Five dwellings were revealed. A fire chamber belonging to the kiln placed in the exterior has been found. Two construction periods could be singled out. Wheel-thrown pottery with white slip was 86%, handmade pottery 14%. There were also large storage pithoi 'khums', or smaller pithoi ('khumchairs'), deep carinated bowls ('tagoras'), jars, potlike vessels, bowls, perforated jars, handmade pots. Among the other finds were a bronze knife of the 'steppe' type, spindle whorls. The material can be compared to the assemblage found at Kangurttut. The settlement of Teguzak is located some kilometers far from the village of Sebiston in Dangarinsky district, on the second lower terrrace of the Vakhsh (P'jankova 1985; 1987: 117; 1988: 297). The Bronze Age layer was covered by the cultural layer of the Hissar culture. The architectural remains were represented by stone based walls built of two to three rows of stones. One residential complex consisting of two rooms was totally excavated; the dwelling corners were oriented to the parts of the world. A cult complex with a pedestal coated with clay was discovered. The Molali pottery of the farming culture was predominant. One of the areas showed a very high percentage of the Andronovo 'steppe' type pottery with comb-puncheon ornament. Some tools, bronze objects and casting forms made of local stone rock occurred. The cemeteries of Nurek (P'jankova 1979a: 78) were discovered in the zone of the Nurek power station near the complex of Tutkaul on the loess terrace of the Vakhsh left bank. The burial constructions were not distinct due to their poor preservation. A burial chamber with bone traces (a skull and long bones of arms) was found. It was blocked with a stone slab. Only some skeletons in a contracted position were excavated (one was a double burial). Other burials did not contain bone traces or they can be regarded as cenotaphs similar to those found in the cemetery of Kangurttut. Burial furnishings included vessels (ranging from 1 to 5) which were typical of the farming pottery from South Tajikistan (vases, bowls, pots etc.), beads (one was an axe shaped pendant similar to that found at Tandyriul), a golden temple ring (Fig. 27.2) and a bronze knife of the so called 'tail' type. (13) There are two other C14 dates for the settlement of Kangurttut (lower levels of Area VI), carried out by the CNRS laboratory in France: 1594 and 1291 B.C. [13] 83</page><page sequence="14">The Kulyab Valley This region has not been thoroughly studied but there are good prospects for a search of monuments of the farming culture. Due to the work of the Kyzylsuisky team two monuments of this culture were discovered but unfortunately they are situated on the territory of the present Muslim cemeteries. Khodja Goib, one of the monuments, is located in Kulyab where three vessels were found, one of which has a spout. They come from destroyed burials and have many analogies in the farming complexes of Margiana and Bactria (Goetzelt et al. 1998: 119, fig. 2.1-3). Another graveyard, Parkhar, is located on the hill not far from the town of Parkhar (Goetzelt et al. 1998: 130). At present it is a Muslim cemetery. One of the destroyed burials contains a stem fragment of a vase of Molali type and two silver bracelets (Fig. 27.7-8) which have an engraved ornament of four-leaf rosettes. This motiv is common for seals and amulets of Bactria and Margiana monuments. The shape of the bracelets, having a rib, is typical of both Central Asian farming culture and of the steppe tribes of Andronovo culture. There are no analogies to the bracelets clasps in the shape of an '8' (eight) figure. Chance findings: The museum in Kulyab keeps a clay model of a house (analogous objects can be found in the plundered graveyards of Southern Bactria and in the Zamam Baba graveyard). It is the first find of this kind on the territory of Southern Tajikistan (Azizi 1992: 13). Different regional museums of the Kulyab valley exhibit slate 'sceptres', some stone 'weights' and other objects analogous to the finds of Bactrian monuments of the farming culture (Fig. 27.9) Shaartuz District Finally two burials of the farming people near the town of Kizlar-Kala of Shaartuzsky district in the Shah oasis (Litvinskij &amp; Sedov 1983: 80) should be mentioned. The burials are of the catacomb type. The first burial was very rich. It contained two skeleton lying face to face in a contracted position. A bowl and a large number of beads in bronze, silver, paste, carnelian and lapislazuli and a pendant made of bronze and gold (Fig. 21.10-14). The second burial included two vessels and a bronze knife. All the ceramic material is typical of the Molali phase of the Sapalli culture. In particular see the Tandyriul assemblage (Figs. 3,5-8). Summing up the results of the excavations we can conclude that the building technique (stone foundation with clay walls) is not common for classical monuments of the late Namazga culture. In all probability this specific building technique might be influenced by environmental conditions in a mountaineous area. Examples of terraced houses are well known in ethnographic literature of Tajikistan (Andreev 1958:431). The structure of burial constructions, funeral ritual and grave furnishings is comparable with those of the Late Bronze monuments of Southern Uzbekistan and 84 [14]</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 10 - The lay-out of excavations and the necropolis of Kangurttut. neighbouring regions. A specific character of our graveyards is that they are usually on the slopes of the hills and due to this position the burial chamber lays at a greater depht than the entrance shaft. The entrance pit is blocked up with stones or large clay pieces. The 'podboino'-catacomb kind of burial construction is typical of related farming cemeteries of the neighbouring Surkhan Daria valley - Djarkutan, Bustan (Shirinov &amp; Baratov 1997 : 65; Avanesova 1997: 148), of the Sumbar valley (Khlopin 1983), of Turkmenia and of Dashli in Afghanistan (Sarianidi 1977). In these burials the catacomb entrance was blocked by row of bricks. In some cases, at Kangurttut, the burial places are the abandoned potter's kilns, the parallels to which can be found in other farming settlements in Southern Uzbekistan - Bustan IV (Rahmanov 1979: 38). In the cemetery of Kangurttut and in the Nurek graveyards, unlike the cemetery of Tandyriul, more than 90% of burials were cenotaphs. This kind of burial appeared on a large scale at the so-called Molali-Bustan stages of the Sapalli culture. According to A. Askarov and T. Shirinov they consist of 17% (reach the proportion of 17% - Askarov &amp; Shirinov 1993: 79). In the necropolis of Bustan N. Avanesova singles out the so-called group of symbolic burials containing animals, clay figurines, etc. Skeletons are absent in these burials (Avanesova 1997: 151; for the cenotaphs see G. Lombardo, here, pp. [43]-[44]). [15] 85</page><page sequence="16">The following part, written by G. Lombardo, regards the analysis of the material culture from the settlements and graveyards of Southern Tajikistan to define the closest analogies, mainly from the sites of Northern Bactria. (N.M.V.) The Material Culture of the Farming Sites in Southern Tajikistan The Pottery (Figs. 3.2-10, 5, 12, 21.3-12, 223-6, 25, 28.2-11) Our documentation of the pottery belonging to the Farming culture of Southern Tajikistan comes for the most part from some larger settlements and necropolis: to the West the cemetery of Tandyriul in the Hissar valley, near the upper course of the river Surkhandar'ja, the two necropolis of Nurek and the settlement of Dakhana in the basin of the upper river Vakhsh to the East and, a little more to the south, the necropolis and settlement of Kangurttut and the settlement of Teguzak (Vinogradova 1993:290). The pottery assemblage of the Tajik sites belongs, together with the Sapalli culture, to the greater Namazga VI-Yaz I culture of which the Sapalli culture itself is the North Bactrian variant (see Vinogradova, here, p. [1]). It must be said, however, that if, generally speaking the pottery forms from the farming sites of Tajikistan have correspondence in the assemblages of the Southern Turkmenian sites, not all the Namazga VI forms are reflected in the Tajik production: some forms, in fact, are rather typical of the Sapalli culture area or more closely limited to Southern Tajikistan. Notwithstanding this, many comparisons between the pottery of the Tajik and that of the Turkmenian sites can be found and, moreover, the manufacture of the pottery itself, with its red paste covered by the heavy white slip is quite typical of Namazga VI (see later). Inside the whole pottery assemblage from the Sapalli sites of Southern Tajikistan we must make a distiction between the site of Tandyriul, which perhaps could be dated slightly earlier, and the other sites which belong to the last part of the Molali and to the Bustan phases. The pottery from Tandyriul is generally wheel made, has a fine purified paste red in colour inside, with mineral and some vegetal inclusions, and externally covered with a thick white slip; The production of other sites, like Kangurttut, for example, is slightly coarser: it is thicker, the paste is less depurated and compact, there are more inclusions. The shapes of vessels are bowls on stem, (wide cups on a stem ending in a conical foot, Fig. 5.1-3), globular high necked jars with tapering base (Fig. 5.4-7) or biconical jars (Fig. 5.8), globular beakers with everted rim and distinct base (Fig. 5.15-17), globular or biconical pots with short neck and flat, sometimes distinct base base (Fig. 5.13-14), a type of deep bowl, with everted rim, ribs and a carination 86 [16]</page><page sequence="17">[17] 87</page><page sequence="18">called in Tajik language 'tagora' (Fig. 5.9-12). The Andronovo ceramics is represented in a small percentage in the pottery production from Tandyriul. The ceramics from Tandyriul belonging to the late Sapalli culture shows some differences in the pottery shapes with the production of the other sites of Southern Tajikistan, Kangurttut, Nurek, Teguzak, Dakhana, although the types are in general the same. Some forms, moreover, seem to be missing in the Tandyriul assemblage but this could be due to the fact that only the necropolis, many burials of which were badly damaged, has been discovered: the settlement, that surely must exist, has not yet been found. Among the forms missing at Tandyriul are the cylindrical beakers that can be found instead in Kangurttut, both in the necropolis and in the settlement, in some different types: with a carination in the lower part of the body, sometimes near the basis (Fig. 25.36, 38-39, 41), in other cases with a rounded carination (Fig. 25.35), or with nearly straight sides (Fig. 25.37); the rim is generally everted but there are also vertical rims (Fig. 25.37, 39) and rims forming a short spout (Fig. 25.37). This form is nearly absent in Tandyriul where is reproduced in miniature (Fig. 5.26-27). The carinated beakers from Tandyriul are also different from the same type from other sites, being globular rather than carinated and ending with a distinct base (Fig. 5.15 17). The same type in Kangurtt and Nurek becomes squat, has a marked carination in the lower part of the body and has a plain flat base (Fig. 25.17-24 from Kangurttut; P'jankova 1981a: 305, fig. 18 II 1, the last two beakers from the left in the upper row and all the beakers in the lower). This type of beaker is documented in the Uzbek sites, particularly Djarkutan and Bustan in both the variants, the globular and the carinated, but the first one is more typical in the first part of the Molali phase while in the last part of Molali and in the phase of Bustan its production seems to decrease and the carinated type begins to be produced in greater amount (Shirinov &amp; Baratov 1997: 103, fig. 24.19-22 from the necropolis 4c of Djarkutan, Period III a, 115, fig. 32.12-19 from the Period III b of the same necropolis; again from Djarkutan, see Askarov &amp; Abdullaev 1983: 107, pi.

XL, Grave 234 on the right, nos. 1-3; Avanesova 1997: 161, fig. 7.4-5, 163, fig. 9.7, 9, 164, fig. 10.21, 13, 171, fig. 14.5-6 from Bustan VI). As in Tandyriul only the globular beakers are documented this could suggest that this necropolis is more ancient than the other cemeteries from Southern Tajikistan where the globular type of beaker has not been found. Both the globular and the carinated beaker can be found also in Southern Tukmenia, in the Namazga V-VI periods. The bowls on stem from Tandyriul have shorter stems with a carination at the junction with the cup (Fig. 5.1-2) and in some cases another in the middle of the stem itself (Fig. 5.3). This last type is documented also in Kangurttut (Fig. 25.8) but beside it there is another, which has a cylindrical stem without carination (Fig. 25.1-4). Both the varieties are documented in the settlements of Teguzak (P'jankova 1988: 254, fig. 4.2, 5, 6) and in the cemeteries of Nurek (P'jankova 1981a: 305, fig. 18, I), in the settlement of Dakhana the form is documented but the vessels are fragmentary, as it looks like, the 88 [18]</page><page sequence="19">[19] 89</page><page sequence="20">Fig. 13 - The settlement of Kangurttut. The Andronovo pottery. type with simple short stem can be found (P'jankova 1994a: 155, figs. 13, 15, 17). In Uzbekistan the low stem with a rib at the junction with the bowl starts in a less elaborated form, with smaller ribs, already during the Djarkutan and Kuzali phases but becomes rather frequent in the Molali one (Shirinov &amp; Baratov 1997: 69, fig. 23 4; 72, fig. 43-4; Askarov &amp; Abdullaev 1983: 21,1.5, Kuzali phase; 26, LI, 2, 6, Molali phase; Shirinov &amp; Baratov 1997: 103, fig. 243-7, from the Period of Djarkutan III a, early Molali; 115, fig. 32.2, without rib, from the Period III b, late Molali; Avanesova 1997: 163, fig. 93-6 from Bustan VI). In one of the burials in the necropolis of Kangurttut (Grave no. 36) has been found a type of globular chalice covered with a layer of red paint or thin slip (Fig. 25.5) which is not documented in the pottery assemblages of the Molali phase neither in Uzbekistan nor in Tajikistan but is instead characteristic in the Sapalli and Djarkutan phases in Uzbekistan (Askarov 1977: 180, pi. XVIJ-4, 7-9, 12-16, 213, pi. XUX.10-18). All the other vessels in the same grave were covered with red paint and red painted pottery has been found in other three burials in the necropolis of Kangurttut (Graves nos. 11, 22), it is possible that these 90 [20]</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 14 - The settlement of Kangurttut. Spindle whorls and other small clay objects. burials are slightly more ancient than the others in the cemetery, also because of the presence in one of the globular chalice typical of the Djarkutan phase. As to other types of open vessels, the simple emispherical bowl with a flat or sometimes a slightly distinct base and a straight or inverted rim, is very frequent in Kangurttut (Fig. 25.25-26, 29-32) but is rare in Tandyriul. The characteristic type of bowl from Tandyriul instead is the 'tagora' (see above, p. [18]) that is deeper, has everted rim with one or more grooves followed by a sharp carination under it (Fig. 5.9-12). This form is present also in the settlement of Teguzak, where it is produced in a simpler type, without the carinations and grooves of the bowls from Tandyriul (P'jankova 1979b: 95, fig. 2.1-2; 1988: 257, fig. 6.2). The crater 'tagora' is present also in the settlement of Kangurttut, in two variants: a type with more rounded body, with ribs and grooves (Fig. 12.12), and a conical type also with a complex outline (Fig. 12.13, see Fig. 5.10, 12 from Tandyriul). Bowls of a type related to the 'tagora' are documented in Southern Turkmenia (Goetzelt 1996: pi. 9.112 from Altyn Tepe, pi. 10.116-117 from Namazga, Periods of Namazga V-VI). In the other sites of the farming culture there is a variety of bowl types: emispherical with a carination under the rim (Fig. 12.14-15 from Kangurttut; P'jankova 1988: 254, fig. 4.8 from Teguzak), deep or shallow bowls with inverted rim and flat base (Fig. 25.25 from Kangurttut; probably P'jankova 1979b: 95, fig. 2.9-10 from Teguzak and 1994a: 155, fig. 4.21-22 [21] 91</page><page sequence="22">2 6a 0 cm 1 OO - o cm Fig. 15 - The settlement of Kangurttut: 1-2. casting moulds; 3-4. metal objects. 92 [22]</page><page sequence="23">Fig. 16 - The settlement of Kangurttut. Clay figurines and graffiti. from Dakhana, all fragmentary, so it can only be supposed that the base was flat); deep or shallow bowls with a rounded carination under the rim and flat base, sometimes distinct (Fig. 25.23, 25, 27-28 from Kangurttut); deep conical bowls with carination under the rim and distinct base (Fig. 25.23, 25, 32, from Kangurttut; P'jankova 1988: 254, fig. 7 from Teguzak). There are also other types of bowls: with ring base, conical body and a carination under the rim or large and shallow, with plain vertical rim, also with ring base (Fig. 25.31 and 34 from Kangurttut) or conical with a low pedestal base (Fig. 25.33 from Kangurttut): this last type can be found also in Djarkutan, in the Molali phase (Askarov &amp; Abdullaev 1983: 26,1.10). Other vessels from Tandyriul show some differences with the corresponding forms from the other Tajik sites: the globular or ovoid jars from Tandyriul have longer neck, more rounded, not very sloping shoulders and distinct base (Fig. 5.4-7), while in the production of Kangurttut and Nurek, for example, the jars have pear shaped or biconical bodies, rather than globular, with sloping shoulders and simple flat rather than distinct base (Fig. 25.11-16, P'jankova 1981a: 305, fig. 18, II, 1, the first and third from the left, III). [23]</page><page sequence="24">I 0 lOchn 6 Fig. 17 - The settlement of Kangurttut. Stone tools. The same thing can be said for the pots, which in the pottery from Tandyriul have high shoulders, globular body tapering near the distinct base. The distinct or tapering base is in general a typical feature of the pottery from Tandyriul which can be considered typologically very near to the production of Djarkutan in the first part of the Molali phase (Djarkutan III a according to Shirinov &amp; Baratov 1997: 65-66 and 103, fig. 24). Most of the pots from Kangurttut and Nurek have biconical, or ovoidal body with sloping shoulders, short neck, broad mouth with everted rim, flat base (Fig. 25.44-47 from Kangurttut; P'jankova 1981a: 305, fig. 18, II, 2, the first four vessels from the left, from Nurek); in the assemblage from Kangurttut are also documented globular or ellipsoidal pots with flat base and a type with distinct base and globular pots with tubular spout (Fig. 25.50-52 and 42 43). The pots from Teguzak and Dakhana are mostly of globular or ovoidal shape, with a broad mouth, short neck or no neck at all, flat or distinct base (P'jankova 1979b: 95, figs. 2.15, 22, 3.9-21; 1988: 254, figs. 4.12, 5.1, 3, 6.1 from Teguzak; P'jankova 1994a: 155, fig. 4.6-12, 5.17 from Dakhana). In Teguzak there is also a type of small piriform jar with high neck which cannot be found in Kangurttut but 94 [24]</page><page sequence="25">mk ft (TO as mm J4w -p?3 B5 BE 3$ 2g ;M4 h\rd, mir xm' xxm m Fig. 18 - The necropolis of Kangurttut. The lay-out. is documented in Bustan (P'jankova 1988: 254, fig. 4.13; see Askarov 1977: 225, pi. LXII. 17 from Bustan). Another vessel shape often found in the settlements of Kangurttut, Teguzak, Dakhana and in the cemeteries of Nurek but not documented in Tandyriul, is the ovoid, globular or ellipsoidal pot with distinct neck, truncated lower part of the body and sharply tapering base (Figs. 12.21-22, 25.48-49 from Kangurttut; P'jankova 1988: 254, fig. 5.10 from Teguzak; 1994a: 157, fig. 5.11 from Dakhana; 1981a: 305, II, 3 from Nurek). This type of pot was very frequent in the pottery assemblages of the Uzbek sites from the Sapalli phase (Kohl 1984: pi. 22; Askarov 1977: pi. XXI from Sapalli Tepe, pi. I?.1-4 from Djarkutan, Djarkutan phase, pi. LXV.2, 6, 10-13 from the Molali phase of Djarkutan; Avanesova 1997: 163, fig. 9.1-2 from Bustan VI, Molali-Bustan phase). Finally, there is a type of bottle with long neck and conical body with a carination near the base (Fig. 12.20), this type of bottle, not very frequent in Southern Tajikistan, is documented in the pottery of [25] 95</page><page sequence="26">Tepe Hissar III B, Altyn Tepe and Sapalli Tepe (Schmidt 1937: pi. XXXVII.H.2227, H.3841, very similar to the bottle from Kangurttut; Goetzelt 1996: pi. 64.855a; Masson 1988: pi. VI.5; Askarov 1977: pi. XLVII.26). In the settlements of Kangurttut, Teguzak, Dakhana have also been found large storage 'pithoi' with short vertical rim and probably ovoidal or globular body (Fig. 12.25-20 from Kangurttut; P'jankova 1979b: 99, fig. 4.2, 3, 4-11 from Teguzak; 1994a: 155, figs. 4.2-2, 5, 6.23, 16-18 from Dakhana). The Southern Tajik sites are in different ways related to the Uzbek sites of the Sapalli culture. All the vessel shapes that we can observe in the sites of the upper Vakhsh valley and in Tandyriul are documented in the Uzbek sites: Djarkutan, Molali itself, Bustan in their Molali-Bustan phases (Askarov 1977: pis. LIX-LXVI; Askarov &amp; Abdullaev 1983: pis. XLVII-LII; Avanesova 1997: figs. 7, 9-10, 14). The pottery from Tandyriul seems to be connected to that of Djarkutan III a, which in the new inner chronology established by Shirinov and Baratov (1997: 65 66) corresponds to the first part of the Molali phase. Nearly all the pottery forms found in Tandyriul have comparisons in Djarkutan: the various types of bowls on stem, except the type with the carinated ring in the middle of the stem, the pots, the globular high necked jars, the small globular jars and beakers with distinct base, the deep bowls (Shirinov &amp; Baratov 1997: 103, fig. 24; see here Figs. 3 and 12). Some pottery forms from Tandyriul have analogies also in the ceramics from the necropolis of Bustan VI: the small globular jars and beakers with distinct base, the various kinds of bowls on stem, a type of globular jar (Fig. 5.2-3, 7, 14-17; Avanesova 1997: 163-64, figs. 9.3-6, 7-9, 10.9). The assemblages from Kangurttut and Nurek, instead, seem to be related to the second part of the Molali and to the Bustan phase. The vessel shapes from Kangurttut have almost exact comparisons in Djarkutan III b: the footed bowls, the globular and biconical pots or jars, the globular pots with tubular spout, the carinated and cylindrical beakers, the various types of shallow and deep bowls (Figs. 12, 25; Shirinov &amp; Baratov 1997: 115, fig. 32; Kohl 1984: pi. 22, Molali assemblage). The same types of vessel from Kangurttut and Nurek can be compared to the specimen from Bustan VI (Figs. 12.2, 25, 21-22, 25.2-4, 12-14, 17-20, 23, 29, 35, 42, 45, 48, 51-52 from Kangurttut; P'jankova 1981a: 305, fig. 18,1, the second footed bowl from the left, II 1, particularly the first row, II 2, II 3, the second pot from left, III, the upper jar; fig. 19, IV, the fourth beaker from the left, V, the second bowl of the second row, the last of the third row, the first of the last row: see Avanesova 1997: figs. 7, 9.2-2, 4, 10, 10, 14.2-5). Some of the pottery shapes, however, as we have seen, are characteristic of the sites of the upper Vakhsh valley while others are rather typical of the Tandyriul assemblage. These differences may be due to the fact that Tandyriul is probably a few centuries more ancient than these sites, particularly than Kangurttut and the cemeteries of Nurek. In regard to the relations with the Turkmenian sites, the forms that can be found both in Southern Turkmenia and in Southern Tajikistan are the craters or 'tagora', 96 [26]</page><page sequence="27">deep conical bowls with slightly rolled rim and flat base, emispherical bowls with slight carination and distinct base, globular pots with everted rim and flat or distinct base, of various sizes, globular or ovoidal pots and pithoi with truncated body and tapering base, cylindrical, globular and carinated beakers, with concave sides and tapering flat base, globular spouted pots or kettles (Goetzelt 1996: pi. 9.112 from Altyn Tepe, nos. 110, 112 from Namazga, no.

In particular, the assemblage from Kangurttut, both settlement and necropolis, shows some similarities with the pottery of the settlement of Takhirbai 3 in Margiana: footed bowls, globular or ellipsoid jars with bevelled bases, pitchers with vertical spout, large conservation jars, carinated beakers, large shallow bowls (Masson 1959: pis. V.l, 4, 6-7, VI.2, 5, 8, 15-17; P'jankova 1994b: 364, fig. 6 III; see here Figs. 12.18-19, 22-23, 25.1, 18-20, 34, 42, 48-49). Some comparable forms can be found also in the assemblage from the sites of the Sumbar valley: deep conical bowls, craters ('tagora'), shallow emispherical bowls, carinated beakers, kettles with tubular spout (Khlopin 1986: 81, fig. 58.7 A.2; 80, fig. 57.6; 66, fig. 34 J; 68 fig. 38.6-7, all from Sumbar necropolis I). The Metal Objects (Figs. 7, 15, 25) Two different metallurgic traditions can be observed in the objects which constitute our documentation about the sites of Southern Tajikistan: one belongs to the Sapalli farming culture and is therefore inside the Namazga VI horizon; the other is the metal industry of the Andronovo tribes. The objects belonging to the Sapalli tradition which have been discovered are mainly miniature objects found in the grave furniture of the cemeteries of the culture and some implements and weapons in life-size from the settlement of Kangurttut. All the metal objects found in the settlement are in bronze, made with the alloy of copper and tin, with a percentage of tin ranging from 3 to 5% (Ravich, forthcoming). In the same settlement, together with some artifacts belonging to the Sapalli tradition, other objects have been found which are instead typical of the Andronovo metallurgy: two specimen of bronze knives-sickles, the so called 'tail knives', which have curved end and only one working side while the other is thicker (Fig. 15.10-11). In one of the two knives, which is nearly complete, the handle is slightly broader than the end; another similar but fragmentary knife has been found in the settlement. [27] 97</page><page sequence="28">This type of knife is well known as a product of the metallurgy of the Andronovo culture, spread from Siberia to Central Asia: a comparison can be found in a bent knife belonging to the Preobradzensky hoard found near the lake Issyk-Kul (Avanesova 1991: fig. 27, in particular, and figs. 20, 26); a specimen of 'tail knife' or bent knife-sickle, although its tip is not so strongly bent, has been found in the site of Kaunda in the area of southern Aral lake (P'jankova 1994b: 366, fig. 7.4, second half of the 2nd millennium); this type can be found also in the metal industry of the nomadic culture of Bishkent-Vakhsh (Vinogradova 1994: 40; Mandel'shtam 1968: pi. III.2). Other implements found in the settlement are two sickles: the first (Fig. 15.12) is fragmentary and all what we can say about it is that it is rather narrow and has only one cutting side; the other sickle (Fig. 15.13) is also curved and with only one working side while the other side is thickened. This type of sickle too belongs to the Andronovo metallurgic production and is documented in the region of Volga and in Central Asia, especially in Kazakhstan in the Late Bronze Age (Vinogradova 1994: 40; Avanesova 1991: fig. 21.55-60). Among the other life-size objects from Kangurttut settlement are two complete daggers: the first (Fig. 15.4) is a long blade with a short broad tang for the handle, the guard sides very sloping, a slightly rounded point and a central rib. This type of knife is a product of the Andronovo metallurgy or of the related 'steppe' industry (Avanesova 1991: fig. 23.20, 30, Urals area, settlements of Volosnikovo - no. 20, and Visokaja Griva - no. 30); our dagger is also comparable to some blades, found in the Digoria region, in the Caucasus (Motzenb?cker 1996: pis. 6.6, 17.6, 19.3, 10, from Verchnaja Rutcha). The other dagger (Fig. 15.5) has a leaf shaped blade with a rather marked central rib, rounded point and a long thick tang, round in section, for the handle. This dagger can be compared to two specimens from central Kazakhstan (Avanesova 1991: fig. 21A.10-11). In the settlement of Kangurttut have also been found a long pin in the tradition of the Sapalli culture metal industry (Fig. 15.14) and an arrow point (Fig. 15.6). The pin belongs to a typology widely spread in Central Asia and particularly in the area of the Sapalli Culture: it has been found in Sapalli Tepe and Djarkutan in the Sapalli and Djarkutan phases (Askarov 1977: pis. XXXIII.5, 9-10, 13, 25, XL.12, XLI. 10 from Sapalli Tepe, Sapalli phase; Askarov &amp; Abdullaev 1983: pi. XXXIII. 17, from Djarkutan, Djarkutan phase; Askarov &amp; Shirinov 1993: fig. 63.77.1, 3, from Djarkutan, Djarkutan phase). Another comparison for the pin can be found in the metallurgy of Tepe Hissar III C (Yule 1982: fig. 17.37; see also Khlopin 1986: fig. 10.11 from Sumbar necropolis I). Again in the metallurgy of Tepe Hissar III C we can found some arrow point similar to our point from Kangurttut (Fig. 15.6, see Yule 1981: fig. 16.6; from the necropolis of Sumbar I, see Khlopin 1986: fig. 62.4). The typology, although, is known also from the nomadic industry (Avanesova 1991: fig. 7.10, Sargary-Alekseevka culture, genetically related with the Andronovo culture, 12th-10th century B.C.; fig. 40.VIII.103, 105-106, all from Central Asia). 98 [28]</page><page sequence="29">The discovery of two moulds for casting (Fig. 15.2-2) is of primary importance for the knowledge of the metallurgical techniques in this area. One of them is only a fragment where the point of an implement, perhaps of a pin or awl or of a chisel, can be seen (Fig. 15.2). The other is a complete mould, composed of two halves, rectangular in shape, with rounded corners. On its surface can be seen the forms for an awl or for a very narrow blade with central rib and for a leaf shaped dagger, with central rib, hilt-guard that gets larger in proximity of the tang. There are no channels for the pouring of the metal, probably the tanged hollow of the dagger could be used for this. The blade shapes appearing in the mould, particularly that of the dagger, are representative of the Andronovo metallurgy: the type is well known from several specimen found in sites belonging to different phases or aspects of the Andronovo Culture, in the wide area of its diffusion; according to Vinogradova (1994: 40-41), this is a dagger of 'classical' Andronovo type, spread not only in Central Asia but also in South-eastern Europe where it is documented in the Volga region, in Ukraine, and, more to the West, in the Danube region (Avanesova 1991: fig. 4.34, Alakul phase, 15th-14th century B.C.; fig. 6.40, Feodorov phase, 14th-12th century B.C.; figs. 23.26, 27, 24A4, 24B.13, 21B.6, 8). Other metal objects from the settlement of Kangurttut are an awl (Fig. 15.3), a button of Andronovo type (Fig. 15.7, see Avanesova 1991: fig. 8.37, culture of Valiakovaya pottery; fig. 49b, Feodorov phase, 14th-12th century B.C.). Slightly different buttons are also documented in the Uzbek cemetery of Bustan VI (Avanesova 1997: fig 13.4) and, much farther towards North-west, in Tepe Hissar III B (Schmidt 1937: pi. 1N.H.2631) and a small ring (Fig. 15.8): for this ring or earring there are comparisons in the Andronovo typologies (Avanesova 1991: fig. 46.54-55, 63, Feodorov phase), but the same type, which is very simple, occurs also in the Sapalli jewellery although there it appears like an open circle while the Kangurttut ring, like the Andronovo specimen, can be closed (Askarov 1977: pi. XXXVIII.22 24, Sapalli Tepe, Sapalli phase; Askarov &amp; Abdullaev 1983: pi. LV23, Djarkutan, Molali phase). Another comparison can be found again in some silver earrings again from Tepe Hissar III B (Schmidt 1937: pi. V.H.2122). Among the metal finds from the necropolis of Tandyriul are an earring and a pendant, both in bronze. The earring (Fig. 6.3) consists in a wire folded as a ring, with a broad end funnel shaped, it belongs to the Andronovo tradition (Avanesova 1991: figs. 44, 45.1-19, 60.2); the pendant also (Fig. 6.2), is a product of the Andronovo jewellery (Avanesova 1991: fig. 61), the grave itself where both these jewels have been found is an Andronovo burial. The documentation that we have at the moment is only partial because there is a big amount of objects coming from cemeteries, while, on the contrary, still too few are the metal finds from settlements. Too few settlements, moreover, have been discovered up till now. In any case, even from the scanty documentation which is available we can observe that there is a considerable number of tools and weapons typologically belonging to the Andronovo metallurgy or to a related industry and [29] 99</page><page sequence="30">this must be meaningful of, may be, a specialization of the nomadic people in providing and working metal, producing implements, in the interaction and exchange economy between sedentary people and nomads. There is a class of bronze objects that is characteristic of the cemeteries during the Kuzali- Molali phases of the Sapalli culture: the miniature implements, weapons, ornaments that were often part of the grave furniture in the necropolis of Southern Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The objects reproduced various types of tools like chisels, blades (these frequently ritually bent to make them unusable), implements for wood working, forks for the grains, containers like shallow bowls, toilet objects and ornaments like mirrors, ear rings, beads. Often in the burials little bowls contained a group of these miniature objects. This particular element of the grave furniture is present in Southern Tajikistan in the necropolis of Tandyriul and Kangurttut, although in this one not in a large amount (Fig. 7.1-17 from Tandyriul, Fig. 26, from the necropolis of Kangurttut). In Uzbekistan miniature objects have been found in the cemeteries of Djarkutan, Molali, Bustan. There are, of course, slight differences in the production of the objects among the various necropolises: those from Tandyriul (Fig. 7.2-17), for example are accurately made and show more similarity with those coming from the Uzbek cemeteries (Askarov 1977: pi. LVII.10-14; Askarov &amp; Abdullaev 1983: pis. XLV.10, 12-16, XLVI.4-9, 11-13, LIV.4-7, Kuzali phase; pi. LV.l, 2, 6, 9-10, 12, phases Molali-Bustan, from Djarkutan). The miniature objects coming from the necropolis of Kangurttut, besides a high variety of implement types, are characterized by the presence of toilet objects and ornaments like mirrors, earrings, beads, an object that could be a ritual sceptre (Fig. 26.19, see Avanesova 1995: 39, fig. 9.12 from Bustan). On the contrary, in the assemblages from Djarkutan, and Tandyriul the miniature ornaments or toilet objects seem to be missing. The miniature objects found in the Tajik sites, as in general all those found in the area of the Sapalli culture in the Kuzali-Molali and Bustan phases, have many comparisons in the life size objects from various sites, not only in Central Asia but also in North-eastern Iran: for example the miniature earrings from Kangurttut (Fig. 26.21-22) are paralleled by life size earrings found in a Molali burial in Djarkutan (Askarov 1977: pi. LXVII.c?-9); another type of earring or temple pendant from Kangurttut (Fig. 26.7) recalls a pair of golden earrings from Tepe Hissar III C (Schmidt 1937: pi. LVI.HJ21&lt;?); the miniature mirror from Kangurttut (Fig. 26.40) has many parallels among Iranian and Central Asian sites: in Central Asia at Altyn Depe (Masson 1988: pi. XV, item 8), Ranni Tulkhar, the cemetery of the Beshkent Vakhsh culture (Mandel'shtam 1968: 149, pi. VIII.2), Sapalli Tepe (Askarov 1977: 201, pi. XXXVII.l, 5-6 of the Sapalli phase), Dashly 3 (Sarianidi 1976: 80, fig. 50.1; 1977: 81, fig. 40.1), from other sites (Kuzmina 1966: 143, pi. XIII.2, 6 from Sadovoe, no. 4, mould, from Chust, no. 9 from Sukuluk), at last, from Tepe Hissar III C (Schmidt 1937: pi. LTV.H.4872). A type of fork used in agricultural activities (Fig. 26.20 from Kangurttut) can be compared to life size specimen from the Bactrian tombs (Sarianidi 1977: 78, fig. 37.2, 3) and from Tepe Hissar III C (Schmidt 1933: 100 [30]</page><page sequence="31">[31] 101</page><page sequence="32">pi. CXX.H.166, H.775); some miniature implements found in Tandyriul (Fig. 7.4, 12) can also be compared with real implements from Tepe Hissar III C (Schmidt 1933: pi. CXIX.H.169). Finally two small shovels or scoops from Kangurttut (Fig. 26.17-18) find a very precise parallel in life size shovels from the robbed tombs in Northern Afghanistan (Southern Bactria - Sarianidi 1990: 115, fig. 5.1, 7). Among the metal ornaments I must quote two bracelets (Fig. 27.7-8; Goetzelt et al. 1998: 131-32, figs. 1-3), probably from the burial of a child, one complete and the other broken in two pieces, which are a very particular and refined product of the Molali culture. They are ribbon shaped and incised with rosettes, herringbone patterns and half ovals, or arches, with a fastening in the form of a 'S'. It is a casual find from the site of Parkhar in the lower Kyzylsu valley where a Muslim cemetery probably covers a necropolis of the Sapalli-Molali farming culture. These bracelets show a strong difference in quality and technology with the common products, or even with the miniature objects, of the metallurgy of the farming culture: as they are life size and as life size objects are not to be found in the graves of the Molali-Bustan phases, it is possible that the bracelets from Parkhar and the graves to which they belonged are of a previous phase, perhaps of Djarkutan phase. Decorated bracelets, diadems or metal sheet ornaments, although with repoussee, not incised, decoration, are known from Tepe Hissar III (Schmidt 1937: pi. LYV.H.4112, H.4128 in copper, pi. EM.H.4321 in silver) and from the cemetery of Sumbar I, in South-western Turkmenia (Khlopin 1986: 15, fig. 5C, E). The motive of the rosette with four petals is well known from the protohistoric art of Mesopotamia and Susiana of the 4th and 3rd millennia (Amiet 1961: pis. 25.411, 27.432, 30.475-479, 489, 51.707; 1972: pi. 26.1121, 1133-1134) can be found also in Eastern Iran, in the compartimental seals of Shahr-i Sokhta and Shahdad, in Bactria (Baghestani 1997: 121, 194-96, fig. 34.94 98; Askarov &amp; Shirinov 1993: fig. 24.12, a seal from the Citadel of Djarkutan). Clay Figurines The plastic art is partly represented by anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines of baked and unbaked clay found respectively in settlements and in cemeteries of the farming culture. The anthropomorphic figurines have been found mostly in the various necropolises but some specimens come also from settlements. In cemeteries they have been usually found in cenotaphs, i.e. in graves containing neither skeleton nor bones: the anthropomorphic figurines were perhaps intended as substitutes of the dead people. This is a characteristic of funerary rituals in the Sapalli culture in the case of cenotaphs: this type of statuette of unbaked clay, representing male or female personages, can be found in the cenotaphs of the whole area of the Sapalli culture from the end of the Kuzali and in the Molali - Bustan phases. Also in the necropolis of Southern Tajikistan these figurines were in cenotaphs. In Tandyriul a male figurine (Fig. 3.1, h cm 38.7, max. w cm 21.5) was in a cenotaph (Grave no. 2) 102 [32]</page><page sequence="33">Fig. 21 - The necropolis of Kangurttut. Burial 73. together with nine vessels: it shows a sitting man, represented in profile, his arms in front of him; the face is drawn in all its particulars, only one arm and leg are represented, because the man is shown in profile but the two hands and feet are represented, the hands hold a cubic object with a piercing hole. This is the only specimen of anthropomorphic figurine from Tandyriul necropolis; also in Kangurttut some of these figurines have been found, in two graves: a female figurine in Grave 26 (Fig. 22.2, h cm 33.2, max. w cm 10.2): it is very simply modelled but many details are represented, as the eyes of an elongated shape, the nose and mouth, also the representation of the body is accurate: the arms, breast and belly are represented. The hips are large and the legs are very short, the feet only suggested. In Grave 73 there were two other figurines, male and female, standing, with a vertical element between them (the stylized figure of a baby or a phallic symbol?) (Fig. 21.2, female figurine h cm 27.6, max. w cm 10.6; male figurine: h cm 35, max. w cm 11.6). 103</page><page sequence="34">0 SO j cm i 6 Fig. 22 - The necropolis of Kangurttut. Burial 26. These two specimens are worse preserved than the other of grave 26: the faces have no more details, the male figure has lost its arms. All these figurines are at various extents very simple and naive in style, especially the two figurines of Grave 73, which, as we have noticed, show a strong simplification of outlines and faces. It is worth observing that in the necropolis of Kangurttut, where cenotaphs are the prevailing type of burial, only three specimens of figurines have been found. Another female statuette in terracotta comes from the settlement of Kangurttut (Fig. 16.3: h cm 7.2, max. w cm 2.2), the figure is strongly stylized: the face is characterized only by the representation of eyes and nose, the arms are suggested by two short triangular terminations, the lower part of the body is cylindrical because the figure represented dressing a long gown. This terracotta statuette finds a comparison in some figurines from the Molali phase from Djarkutan (Askarov &amp; Shirinov 1993: fig. 50.9-11). In any case the anthropomorphic figurines trom Southern Tajikistan can be compared to those from the Uzbek cemeteries like Bustan and Djarkutan. Sometimes the figurines from these Uzbek sites represent seated personages like the one from Tandyriul: a seated figurine from Djarkutan represents perhaps a woman with the hands at her breast. It is difficult to establish if it is really a female figurine but the attitude with the hands at the breast and the position could suggest that it is (Askarov &amp; Shirinov 1993: fig. 85). Other seated figurines are documented from the necropolis of Bustan VI although they are different from the Tandyriul specimen (Avanesova 1995: 41, figs. 8, 11,14-15). The Kangurttut figurines (Figs. 21.2,22.2) show some iconographic element, 104 [34]</page><page sequence="35">Fig. 23 - The necropolis of Kangurttut. Burial 60. as the hands at the breast, in common with some specimen from Bustan VI, although there are also other basic iconographic and stylistic differences (Avanesova 1995: 38, fig. 8.5, the first figurine of the upper row, 39, fig. 9, the first, 41, fig. 17). The plastic art is also represented in the finds from the Tajik sites by zoomorphic figurines or by other objects with animal termination. From the settlement of Kangurttut comes the head of a horse or hound figurine which is noteworthy for its realism (Fig. 16.2: h cons, cm 7.4, max. w cm 7.2), a stylistic comparison for it can be found in the necropolis of Bustan were a horse head, also very realistic, has been discovered (Avanesova 1995: p 10, fig. 39.7). In the same settlement of Kangurtttut some fragments have been found, probably part of objects (perhaps vessels), in the shape of animals: the terminal part of an object in the shape of a bird's head and the head and neck of a sheep (Fig. 16.1 and 4), both of them are very carefully moulded. These fragments with animal termination can be compared to parts of vessels from Djarkutan (Askarov &amp; Shirinov 1993: fig. 501) and to a votive altar in the shape of a bird discovered in the necropolis of Bustan VI (Avanesova 1995: p. 38, fig. 7 A). A comparable vessel fragment, a spout in the form of a sheep has been found in Altyn Tepe in Southern Turkmenia (Masson 1988: pi. XX.4. [35] 105</page><page sequence="36">Fig. 24 - The necropolis of Kangurttut. Burial 73. See also Hiebert 1994: 66, fig. 4.37.1, 3, from Gonur North, Period I, around the first centuries of 2nd millennium, according to Hiebert, ibid:. 173, fig. 9.a-b). From the necropolis of Tandyriul comes a massive figure, representing perhaps a lion: this is the only specimen of animal figure coming from a necropolis, in fact, judging from the available documentation, in the cemeteries of the Sapalli culture only anthropomorphic figurines have been found up till now while nearly all the zoomorphic figurines come from settlements. The other finds from the Southern Tajik sites of Tandyriul and Kangurttut consist of stone objects like amulets, beads of semiprecious stones and implements. An important class of amulets are the axe shaped pendants (Figs. 7.27-30, 8), present in the cemeteries of Tandyriul and Nurek (Fig. 8, the first of the second row and the first and second of the third row), a widely spread typology in the area of the Sapalli culture during the Kuzali and Molali phases (15th/16th-11 th centuries B.C.), which was produced also in Djarkutan in the Kuzali, Molali and Bustan phases (Askarov 1977: pi. LVll.18-19; Askarov &amp; Abdullaev 1983: pis. XLVJ-7, LV.i-5; Shirinov &amp; Baratov 1997: fig. 18.7 from Djarkutan; Avanesova 1997: fig. 10.4 from Bustan VI). There were also cylindrical beads of semiprecious stones like lapislazuli, carnelian and beads made of paste of anular shape or composite, i.e. cylindrical with grooves (Figs. 7.18-21, 8). Chalcedony beads of oblong biconical or of cylindrical shape and composite paste beads can be compared to beads found in Tepe Hissar 106 [36]</page><page sequence="37">4 20 ;~j~ ~ '~i37 i 39 K $ 43 .45 4</page><page sequence="38">III C (Schmidt 1937: pi. LXVII.H.3590, the penultimate, H.3591, the third from the left in the second row, H.3592, the second and the third from the left, H.3593, the second from the left in the second row; pi. LXVI.H.5223, the last from the left). In the necropolis of Kangurttut there were no stone pendants or amulets and generally no ornaments of any type except the miniature metal implements and ornaments. Some specimens of biconical and cylindrical beads in semiprecious stones have been found in Kangurttut settlement (Vinogradova 1994: fig. 10.8-9). A very important and meaningful find from the necropolis of Tandyriul is a small stone column (Fig. 4.2), the typical 'miniature column' which is so frequent in the burials of Central Asia, Pakistan, North-eastern and Eastern Iran (Boroffka &amp; Sava 1998). The column from Tandyriul is similar to the other known specimen: with concave sides and an horizontal groove on the superior face (in particular see Boroffka &amp; Sava 1998: 29, figs. 11.2-5, 31.2 from Bactria; fig. 16.2-3 from Quetta; 69, fig. 42.4 from Dashli 3; Masson 1988: pi. XXXV.2-2 from Altyn Depe; Hiebert 1994: 156, fig. 9.22.2, 4, 7 from Togolok 21; Museo Nazionale d'Arte Orientale Inv. no. 6094 from Shahr-i Sokhta; Schmidt 1937: pi. LXI.2-2, 173, fig. 97, 218, fig. 132 from Tepe Hissar). This object comes from a destroyed burial which perhaps belonged to an important member of the community. Another stone object found in Tandyriul, probably from the same grave, is a weight of oval form with a handle (Fig. 4.2). Other stone undecorated weights from Southern Tajikistan have been casually discovered in the lower Kyzylsu valley; some weights come also from the cemeteries of Saed (Moskovsky District) and Alimtaj (Dangara District), two other weights of unknown provenience are in the museum of Kuljab (Goetzelt et al. 1998: 132-33). Other comparisons can be found in some more ancient weights from Sarazm II (Isakov 1991: fig. 31.2-2, 6-7, 3300-3000 B.C.) and in similar weights belonging to the Sapalli culture area in Uzbekistan (Askarov &amp; Shirinov 1993: fig. 64.II.2); undecorated stone weights of about the same type have been found also in Altyn Depe (Masson 1988: pi. XXXV.6; Winkelmann 1997: fig. 13, Namazga IV-V, second half of the 3rd millennium, see also figs. 12 and 16 for weights from other sites). In the lower Kyzylsu valley some stone 'sceptres' of a very elongated oval shape (Fig. 27.3) have been casually found in the area of Sovetskij and Kuljab, they are similar to other specimen in the museum of Kuljab (Goetzelt et al. 1998: 133); they can be compared to other 'sceptres' from Altyn Depe (Boroffka &amp; Sava 1998: 70-71, figs. 43.2, 44.2; Masson 1988: pi. XXXV.5). These important ritual objects have been frequently found in graves in Central Asia, their meaning, as in the case of the small stone columns, is still not completely clear, except for the fact that it is undoubtedly connected to the idea of power (Boroffka &amp; Sava 1998; Winkelmann 1998:2-3, fig. 1.3). Several stone farming implements, made of slate, limestone and sandstone, have been found: among them pestles, grinding stones for grain, graters, strikers, anvils and weights. N. Skakun (forthcoming) has studied the use traces remained on stone objects and implements: in many case some grinding stones and the anvils. In some cases the long sides of grinding stones and those of the anvil appear to have been 108 [38]</page><page sequence="39">Fig. 26 - The necropolis of Kangurttut.

[39]</page><page sequence="40">used for grinding materials harder than the grain. Some broken grain graters have been reused for grinding ochre or mineral inclusions for pottery, or to give an edge to metal implements. The traces of dots on anvils indicate that small metal objects were worked on them. Among the small finds from the settlements of the farming culture there are some biconical clay or terracotta spindle whorls from the settlement of Kangurttut (Fig. 14, the first three in the upper row) which are of the same type found in Tandyriul (Vinogradova 1991: 83, fig. 6.36); biconical spindle whorls have been found also in Sapalli Tepe and Djarkutan (Askarov 1977: pis. XXXIV-XXXV; Askarov &amp; Abdullaev 1983: pi. XLVI.20, 14-16, Kuzali phase; pis. LIV.S, 10-11, LV.1J, Molali phase). Some other spindle whorls, in the shape of a shallow pierced disk, are often obtained from a pottery sherd (Fig. 14, the last three in the second row, see also a very ancient comparison from Sarazm (Isakov 1991: fig. 22, the last two rows, second half of the 4th-beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C.). Other small conical, biconical or ellipsoidal terracotta objects, which perhaps were handles of implements, have been found in the necropolis of Tandyriul (Vinogradova 1991: 83, fig. 6.31-35). In Kangurttut also some clay sling pellets in an elongated oval shape have been found (Fig. 14, the last objects). The study of the materials coming from these Southern Tajik sites allow us, in a small extent, to try to understand some elements of the economy of the communities which developed between the second half of the 2nd and the beginning of the 1st Millennium, in the late Bronze-Early Iron Ages. The people of the Sapalli culture practised agriculture, as it can be observed considering the finds from the settlements in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, here particularly the finds from Kangurttut include several agricultural implements such as grinding stones and also a metal sickle. The paleobothanic analysis of the ground in the levels of Kangurttut settlement show the presence of various types of cereals like barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat, millet, flax (see Vinogradova, here, pp. [4], [10]). The cattle and sheep breeding was also an important resource: in winter shepherds kept their herds in the valleys among the mountain ranges, while during the summer they used the pastures on the mountains; cattle, sheep, goats were bred, bones of domestic dogs and even some bones of horse have also been found (see Vinogradova, here, p. [10]). Among the industries, like for example metal working, the documentation suggests the existence of an intense interaction between sedentary people and nomads: probably the metal industry was in the hands of the nomadic tribes. The Andronovo populations or those related with Andronovo were, from their origin in Siberia, traditionally specialized in metal trade and working; with the spreading of the Andronovo tribes in Central Asia, a branch of them settled in Kazakhstan, an area which was very rich in copper and tin ores. The analysis and the study of the metal objects from the sites of Southern Tajikistan, particularly Tandyriul and Kangurttut, 110 [40]</page><page sequence="41">/ 5-1 I I * fem ? (Sly &gt;X7 Fig. 27 - Occasional finds from decayed burials: Nurek (nos. 1-2); the Hissar valley (no. 3); Sharshar (no. 4); Arakcin (no. 5); Ramit (no. 6); Parkhar (nos. 7-8); the Kuljab valley - the Kuljab Museum (no. 9); Kyzlar-Kala (nos. 10-14).</page><page sequence="42">have revealed their relationship with the production of the site of Dal'Verzin in the Fergana valley, with the metals of the Burgulyuk Culture in the oasis of Tashkent and with the objects found in the necropolis of Chaka in the valley of the river Zeravshan in central Uzbekistan. As the bronze objects from all these sites in Uzbekistan and those from Southern Tajikistan, show some chimical differences from the Andronovo bronzes from Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Urals and Siberia although, like these, they are also not arsenical but tin bronzes, it is possible that the tin source for the Fergana and Zeravshan valleys and for the oasis of Tashkent was in this part of Central Asia and that the Andronovo tribes which had settled in the Zeravshan valley, whose metals were similar in composition to the objects from the mentioned Uzbek and Tajik sites, acted as intermediaries between the northern regions, such as Kazakhstan and the Fergana valley, where the metal sources were, and the Southern which exchanged their agricultural products with metals (Ravich, forthcoming). As we have already noticed, many implements and weapons among those discovered at least in the settlement of Kangurttut were of Andronovian workmanship, moreover two moulds have been found in the settlement: this means perhaps that the Andronovo or 'steppe' objects that have been found did not necessarily come from an exchange but were locally produced either by Andronovo people living in proximity of the settlement (if not in the settlement itself) or also by the inhabitants themselves using moulds of Andronovo type. This second hypothesis, however, looks less probable: it seems difficult that blacksmiths used moulds belonging to another metallurgic tradition. In any case, the analysis on Kangurttut bronzes, have shown some particular carachteristics about the technology. We can at least hypothesize that there was an intense exchange or even a division in the economy among farming and nomadic tribes. The interaction between farming people and nomads can be observed also in an Andronovo burial in Tandyriul (see above, pp. [6], [29]). The pottery was locally made, at least in the settlement of Kangurttut, where some kilns for pottery have been discovered in the settlement limit area. They were one near the other, at a distance of 6 metres. One of them was badly damaged, all what remained of it was the lower part, which had been dug lower in the ground, while the upper with its mouth was lost. The other kiln was better preserved, it probably had a domed structure, with an upper and a lower chamber: in the lower burnt the fuel, which, by its heath and the following chemical reactions, baked the vessels. The type of bipartite kiln is common in the wide area of the Namazga VI horizon (Vinogradova 1994: 36 and fig. 6.4). The type of kiln with domed structure, with the lower part dug deep in the ground, can be observed in Uzbekistan from the Sapalli phase in Sapalli Tepe (Askarov 1977: 36-38, figs. 10-11; Rahmanov 1979: 35-42; for kilns in Turkmenia see Sarianidi 1957; Masimov 1975: 9). What is important to stress is that the presence of these kilns demonstrates that the settlement of Kangurttut produced pottery on its own and was therefore autonomous. It would be interesting to investigate if this pattern of production was repeated in the other settlements of the farming culture in Southern Tajikistan. In Uzbekistan we know that the larger fortress-settlements like Sapalli Tepe 112 [42]</page><page sequence="43">or Djarkutan had inside the fortress itself specialized production areas for the food, for the pottery, the metalworking, the semi-precious stones working and, in general, for the various kinds of handicrafts but this was characteristic of the larger settlements, we know less about the smaller villages. For Southern Tajikistan, we have even less documentation about the settlement typology and distribution. In any case Kangurttut, with its autonomous industrial production and with its rather extended necropolis, appears us as a settlement which could have had some importance in the territory, although it was no more than a farming village. Unfortunately, as I told before, too few settlements have been excavated up till now in Southerf Tajikistan to draw a picture of the settlement pattern in this region. Among the findings in the various sites of Sapalli culture in Southern Tajikistan are beads or amulets in semiprecious stones, such as lapislazuli, turquoise, jasper, onyx and other chalcedony varieties: this means that the farming communities of this area were included in the routes of the long distance trade that brought these stones from their sources (mainly Afghanistan for lapislazuli, the Kyzylkum desert for turquoise, Northern India for the agates and chalcedony but also the Iranian plateau for other stones) to the various regions of Central Asia and westward to the Iranian plateau and to the Near Eastern countries (Herrman 1968:21-57; Lamberg-Karlovsky &amp; Tosi 1973: 21-53; Kohl 1982:23-31; Casanova 1995:15-20; Lombardo 1998:49-53). Judging from the findings in the necropolis of Tandyriul and, to a less extent, in that of Kangurttut there was probably a social hierarchy: in both the cemeteries there are burials that distinguish themselves for their richness or, at least for a greater quantity of objects in the furniture. In Tandyriul the richest graves are furnished with pottery, ornaments in semiprecious stones, miniature metal objects. In some exceptional cases of burials probably belonging to particularly important members of the community there are ritual objects like the small stone 'bactrian column'. In the necropolis of Kangurttut where, instead, no ornaments or personal objects have been found in the burials, the richest of them could be distinguished because they were furnished with a great number of pottery vessels, some also with miniature metal objects and two with the anthropomorphic figurines of unbaked clay. This lack of life sized objects in the necropolis of Kangurttut and in the same time the presence of their miniature metal reproductions might be connected to the main character of the necropolis itself: the prevalence of the cenotaph burial (over the 90% of the burials are cenotaphs): as the cenotaph in some way is rather the memory of a burial, so again a memory of what in other cemeteries are the personal items of the dead is in some of the Kangurttut burials. The cemeteries of Nurek were too damaged to allow any hypothesis to be put forward, although the finding of a pendent with turquoise (P'jankova 1981a: 309) let us think that rich furniture could have been buried in some of the graves. The necropolis of Kangurttut and those of Nurek constitute an example of the trend followed by the Sapalli-Molali culture in Tajikistan: the majority of the burials in the cemeteries of Nurek and Kangurttut are cenotaphs. From the disposition of [43] 113</page><page sequence="44">the furniture, mostly pottery vessels, in the burials it would appear as some place had been left free for a corpse but, except few cases, in almost the burials there is not any skeleton or even bones. In some burials there are animal bones as it was the custom in the first examples of cenotaphs in the necropolis of Djarkutan, in the phase having the same name, when an animal, usually a goat, was buried in the place of the dead person (Shirinov &amp; Baratov 1997: 118). The bones of a goat have been also found in the only cenotaph discovered in Tandyriul (burial no. 2). The difference in the burial customs among the cemeteries of Kangurttut and Nurek on one side and that of Tandyriul with the contemporary Uzbek cemeteries of the Molali phase on the other, consists in this general use of the cenotaph burial in the first, while, particularly in the Uzbek cemeteries, the presence of cenotaphs increases from Djarkutan to Molali-Bustan phases but never reaches a larger percentage than 17% (Shirinov &amp; Baratov 1997: 118). This difference in funerary rituals cannot be casual but it must be perhaps the result of a change in the religious ideology, begun during the Kuzali phase in Uzbekistan where, however, it never prevailed; later, during the Molali phase, with the movements of part of the population eastward, the new ideology spread to Tajikistan where, on the contrary, it became a general custom. This must have happened not a long time after the arrival in Southern Tajikistan of the farming people from Uzbekistan. The necropolis of Tandyriul, where there is a prevalence of inhumation burials and only two cenotaphs, must belong to a slightly more ancient period, perhaps between the end of the Kuzali phase and the beginning of Molali. For what appears of its funerary rites and for its grave furniture and perhaps also because of its proximity to the Uzbek sites of the Surkhandarja valley, Tandyriul is culturally nearer to the Uzbek aspect of the Sapalli civilization, while the cemeteries of Kangurttut and Nurek, being later, show changed funerary usages with the cenotaph custom fully developed and may represent what the Sapalli farming culture became in Tajikistan. (G.L.) The Early Iron Age Monuments (Period Yaz I) At the turn of the 2nd and 1st millennium B.C. in the southern regions of Central Asia a new archaeological complex, represented by the material of Yaz I layer, is documented. Its distinguishing feature is the presence of painted pottery. The latest archaeological discoveries do not exclude a partial coexistence of archaeological complexes of Namazga VI and Yaz I (Sagdullaev 1982). The most ancient finds of iron objects were revealed in the settlement of Anau and, according to A.S. Sagdullaev, can be placed in the 9th-7th centuries B.C. (Sagdullaev 1982: 233). 114 [44]</page><page sequence="45">Fig. 28 - The settlement of Karim Berdy: 1. - the lay-out of the settlement; 2. - the 'A' trench: I - general look, in the centre - the rectangular stone structure before cleaning; II - the rectangular structure after cleaning - drawing of the outline and of the face.

Shaidulaev in the citadel of Djarkutan where in the upper layers was found a bronze knife with iron rivets. The knife belongs to the Djarkutan phase of the Sap alii culture, belonging to the 13 th century B.C. according to the chronology used by the Russian archaeologists (Shaidullaev 1998: 39-41). Two iron objects come from the Bronze Age layers in the settlements of Togolok 21 and Gonur (Sarianidi 1999: 68). Thus the most ancient finds of the Iron Age in Central Asia can be dated to the 15th/13th century B.C. In the South of Tajikistan the Yaz I layers are traced in the upper layers of the settlements of Kangurttut and Teguzak (Vinogradova 1994; P'jankova 1987). In Vosseisky district, the valley of the Kysylsu river, the settlement of Karim-Berdi was discovered. The excavated layers can belong only to Yaz I Period (Vinogradova 1987: 76; P'jankova 1996: 195). It covers an area of 200 x 300 m; the monument is situated on a natural hill (Fig. 28.1). It is surrounded from three sides by deep ravines with streams flowing into the Shurak river (the tributary of the Kyzylsu). Dwellings with stone based walls (Fig. 28.2), hearths, and storage pits (P'jankova 1996: 209, fig. 2). According to L.T. P'jankova the wheel-made ceramics makes up 62%. Pot-like vessels, deep bowls and 'khums' can be singled out (Fig. 29.6-7). Pots, basins, spouted vessels with relief bands, jar lids with loop shaped handle are typical of hand made pottery (Fig. 29). Painting occurs on the wheel thrown pottery. It is represented only by a few fragments (Fig. 29.12-13); the design is painted in dark red on the whitish-yellow surface. The ornament of inverted triangles and angles occurs. The closest analogies of Karim Berdy pottery material can be observed in the sites of Yaz Depe, in the oasis of Murghab river, in the Early Iron Age, of Kuchuk Depe I (Askarov &amp; Al'baum 1979), Mirshadi (Pugachenkova 1972: 47-51) and in the upper horizon of Djarkutan (Askarov 1976: 17 ff.) in Southern Uzbekistan, at Tillya Tepe in Northern Afghanistan (Sarianidi 1972) and in the Chust culture of Fergana (Zadneprovsky 1962). At Karim Berdy, unlike the above-said sites, painted pottery is very rare. Vessels with handles and earthenware with black polishing, which is typical of settlement of Afghanistan, is lacking. Among other finds, of interest is a bronze celt-adze (Fig. 29.19) made of tin bronze where tin makes up 10%. Typologically M.N. Gryaznov considered these tools celts of the Karasuk culture (Gryaznov 1941: 262). A celt similar to this was uncovered in Southern Tajikistan at Kulip Tepe, near Regar, in a male inhumation (Kuz'mina 1966: pi. IV. 7). G.V. Parfyonov places this find in the Bronze Age. The absolute and relative chronology is a highly debatable question and subject of discussion. For example, suffice it to say that the chronological limits for Yaz I are placed from the 15th century B.C. (Kohl 1984: 230, pi. 2) to the 7th century B.C. (Masson 1959: 108) (14). The absolute and relative chronology of the Early Iron Age (14) See calibrated dates in Table 1. For Kuchuk Depe and Dal'verzin Depe. 116 [46]</page><page sequence="47">Fig. 29 - The settlement of Karim Berdy: nos. 1-22 (according to N. Vinogradova); nos. 23-26. (After L. P'jankova 1996). [47] 117</page><page sequence="48">monuments is directly connected with the division into periods of the Late Bronze Age monuments which still exist or perhaps coexist with settlements of Yaz I type. In our opinion the above said analogies of Karim Berdy settlement as compared with other Bactrian monuments - Kangurttut, the upper stratum - make it possible to place it into the latest 2nd-early 1st millennium B.C. The discovery of such transitional sites, from Late Bronze to Early Iron Age, as Karim Berdy allows to make things clear and to cast a new light on the general problem of the provenance of the cultures with painted pottery in Central Asia which had existed at the beginning of the Early Iron Age. (N.M.V.) The following conclusions can be drawn about the above-said monuments of the Late Bronze Age in Southern Tajikistan. Certain conformity to natural laws in settling of farming communities and 'steppe' tribes can be seen. Foothills, mountain valleys, high river terraces were the areas where the farming communities settled, only in some cases burials of the 'steppe' cultures occur there. Farming settlements in South Tajikistan are connected with waves of migrant groups coming from South-eastern regions of Southern Uzbekistan in the later stages of the Sapalli culture - Molali-Bustan. The spread of these monuments coincides with ancient caravan ways - from the Surkhan-Darja valley to the Hissar valley as far as Dushanbe (the present geographic names), then via Faizabad on the river Ilyak as far as Nurek and via the Gulizindonsky pass to Kangurt-Kuljab. It should be said that the south-western Tajikistan is rich in salt: domes of pure salt rise in the landscape (Khodjamunin and Khodjasartis). In ancient times these caravan ways could be used as trade routes. But this is just a working hypothesis. In the process of adaptation to a new ecological niche the transformation of a cultural tradition takes place. It becomes apparent in the building of stone houses and in the arrangement of burial structures. Also the 'poverty' of archaeological finds in the late stages of the Sapalli culture is quite obvious thinking that these later stages take place in a period of changes and gradual migration: for example, burials contains only votive objects and there are no seals and works of art or of handicraft with the exception of the bracelets from Parkhar. The use of cenotaphs appear in the burial ritual at a certain moment, perhaps between the Kuzali and the Molali phase, increases in Uzbekistan to a certain extent and is widespread in some cemeteries of Southern Tajikistan (Vinogradova, p. [15]; Lombardo, pp. [43]-[44]). The presence of the Andronovo population can be confirmed not only by monuments of Andronovo culture (Vinogradova 2001: 204) but also by finds: Andronovo pottery, metal objects that in their shape and chemical composition are of Andronovo type. The presence of casting moulds in farming settlements gives reason to believe that the metal processing took place there (see G. Lombardo, here, 118 [48]</page><page sequence="49">p. [42]; Ravich, forthcoming). In their work foundry men used bronze with a low tin content which is typical of the metal object of the 'steppe' tribes of Southern Tajikistan and of the Zeravshan valley (Ravich, forthcoming). The interaction between nomads and sedentary people brought to the settling and to the subsequent assimilation of the inhabitants of the steppes among the farming population. Such examples can be found in the ethnography of Southern Tajikistan (Karmisheva 1976: 259). It is not a case that here this exchange between farming populations and nomadic tribes may have given birth in the Late Bronze Age to the mixed culture of Beshkent-Vakhsh, although the participation of the farming people to its formation is still a matter of debate. In any case close contacts of the farming people with the bearers of the Beshkent-Vakhsh culture are also documented by the presence of burials of this culture in the graveyards of the farming culture as well as finds of Molali pottery in monuments of the Beshkent Vakhsh (Mandel'shtam 1968: pi. XIV; P'jankova 1986: figs. 59-60). Even after a necessarily brief analysis such as this, a picture of the relation of the Southern Tajik sites in the Molali phase with the mother culture of Sapalli in Uzbekistan can be traced. Considering the various aspects of the material culture and particularly the ceramic production we can observe that Tandyriul shows to be still bound to the older phases of the Uzbek area of the culture and this can be observed not only in the pottery production but also in other cultural aspects, as in the funerary rituals that are different from those which can be reconstructed from the grave finds in Kangurttut. If Tandyriul appears earlier and more linked to the Uzbek aspect of the Sapalli culture in comparison to the sites of the upper Vakhsh reaches, like Nurek, Teguzak, Kangurttut, Dakhana, these show to be connected to the second part of Molali and to the Bustan phases and moreover to be closely related to each other in the pottery production. We can therefore consider these sites as being part of a unique aspect of the Sapalli culture, the aspect it took as it spread to Southern Tajikistan. They are still more meaningful because they show how the North Bactrian culture of Sapalli could change once that the populations moved from the original nucleus to other regions where there were other dynamics of peopling and interaction with the nomad tribes: although the main cultures that occupied Southern Tajikistan at the end of the 2nd millennium are quite distinct from each other, they show nevertheless the trace of this interaction in every aspect of the material culture.
