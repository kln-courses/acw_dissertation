<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOCIAL AND METAPHYSICAL REBELLIONS OF VAUTRIN AND THE "INNOMINATO" by Jean-Pierre Barricelli It is not surprising that the most formidable and fantastic character in Balzac's social epic of the Comédie Humaine , as well as in Manzoni's historico- metaphysical1 epic of I Promessi Sposi , in each case grew out of Romanticism's fascination with the legacy of Satan. With differing emphases, Vautrin (Le Père Goriot, Les Illusions perdues, Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes) and the Innominato (capitalization arbitrarily mine) partake of the daimonic and the demonic qualities of the Archfiend as literature and tradition have advanced them to us.2 The daimonic represents the urge in everything to affirm and perpetuate itself; it controls, teaches, disintegrates and creates, like Goethe's Mephistopheles, crumbling the personality but integrating it again into a new form, a new whole. The demonic, on the other hand, represents a purely destructive drive, like Satan in the Book of Job, thriving on violence and chaos- which is the daimonic out of control-and submitting all to nihilistic precepts. Both work at cross-purposes with the moral and civic orders of the world. They are overlapping, awesome forces which emanate from the construct of evil in the universe, or, let us say, from Jung's shadow, the innate propensity for evil resident in the depths of human nature. Myth, for the Romantics, did not preclude a real existence. As de Rougemont argues, "in myths, a reality is by definition equivalent to a meaning, and vice versa. At times Satan emerged as a full-fledged character, identified by his historical name: Lucifer, as, for example, in Byron's Cain, where he becomes the consultant of a troubled human being in his perpetual quest for answers. Reaction from some contemporaries may well have prompted the poet to call the tragedy his "Waterloo," but the excited praiseof Goethe, Shelley, and Scott tells a different story, typical of the Romantic mood. At other times, however~and more frequently-Lucifer is anthropomorphic, and logically so, for like us the Romantics realized that we live in a world of form. In such cases, while we are dealing with a fictional character with a fictional name, we are also dealing with a satanic presence, an emanation of evil, its coefficient. The Romantic mind, then, made this kind of character, as a symbolic incarnation of the Devil's reality, exist in a different order of magnitude from all other characters. He assumed titanic proportions. Satan, after all, was a Promethean being who rebelled for progress. Indeed, Romanticism's scant attention to the frozen, dehumanized, and impotent Lucifer of Dante's Inferno would seem to contradict its glorification of the Commedia; when it came to the Satan figure, Romanticism preferred the warm, all too human, and powerful rebel of, say, Paradise Lost : the challenger, demonic or daimonic, in motion and not in ice. Dante's fiend was enormous, not titanic; Milton's, if anything, was the reverse. And titanic are the existences of Vautrin and the Innominato. In creating the former, Balzac yielded to the perverse part of his world view, in which the power of evil gains a certain dark glamor and negative splendor, whereas through the Innominato Manzoni underscores his spiritual view of the world, in which 19</page><page sequence="2">Providence works out inside of man a fated ascension. On the surface, it might appear that, of the two satans, Vautrin should command the greater attention by the twentieth century reader. Without necessarily denying this, we should like to suggest that the Innominato claims our closer attention, because in the long run, he is more modern, more "existential." In fact, the fundamental similarity as well as difference between the two lies in Camus' binomial as expressed in L'Homme révolté: faced by the negation of the individual, absurdity, and death, man's only recourse of dignity and sanity lies in rebellion, which may take either of two forms: social or metaphysical. "Strillano. . .gli uomini alle volte, quando non si possono rivoltare," utters Manzoni's outlaw. Rebellion reflects a deep consciousness, and both Vautrin and the Innominato are deeply "conscious" men, in the sense that all moments of their existence are tense with concentration, more so than those of Goriot, Rastignac, Mme. Vauquer, or of Lucia, Don Abbondio, or Don Rodrigo. They live more intensely than the others; their suffering (Goriot and Lucia notwithstanding) and their anger stand out more immoderately. In this respect, they anticipate later intellectual anarchists like Raskolnikov. But Vautrin's rebellion, being an intellectual rebellion of a social nature, leads to alienation, to incognito, to being ostracized as Public Enemy Number One. Conversely, the Innominato's rebellion, being also intellectual but revealing a metaphysical nature, leads to estrangement, to dissociation and self- doubt, and to the lonely dread which in his case opens the door to conversion and salvation. Many stories of the devil lurked in the background of the two authors' formation as writers, though one may be singled out as especially illustrative of their generation's singular fascination with the satanic legacy. We are quite certain that the Story of Robert the Devil was known to Manzoni through a 1787 version in the Bibliothèque bleue , as Littré and Nisard relate,4 and we know of Balzac's attraction to it, if only through his lengthy account of Meyerbeer's opera in Gambara. Robert was an evil spirit, like Vautrin and the Innominato, the embodiment of a symbolic reality or presence with a terrible animus of its own. W ith a band of cutthroats, he withdrew to a fortified rock in the forest from which he could radiate evil into the world, much in the way the Innominato does it from his isolated castle outside the city, or Vautrin from his obscure pension inside it. And like both of them, Robert eventually reverted to the good life. It is aesthetically appropriate that Manzoni and Balzac, in creating their more intellectually powerful and artistically sophisticated titans of evil, should have suggested their spiritual identities by seeding their texts with epithets and word- symbols, which, by fomenting a satanic atmosphere, enable the reader to sense a dimension beyond the purely human. Balzac's reader is haunted by a miasma of epithets: Vautrin is a "terrible mentor," "terrible athlète," "terrible prêtre," "terrible juge," "génie de la corruption," "génie du mal" "féroce conducteur," "féroce calculateur," "Machiavel du bagne," not to mention an extensive list of straight demonological terms. Operating from within a drab, nineteenth century Parisian pension and therefore "plus étrange qu'étranger," Vautrin possesses those "regards fixes et pénétrants qui font entrer la volonté des gens forts dans 1 ame des faibles," and his acid, Juvenalian invectives against society strike the same kind of terror as some of his mannerisms, like spitting: "A la manière dont il lançait un jet de salive, il annonçait un sang-froid imperturable qui ne devait pas le faire reculer devant un crime pour sortir d'une position équivoque." s There is a similarly extensive list of demonological terms which are concentrated in the relatively few (5 out of 38) but pivotal chapters which center around the activities of the Innominato. The word "diavolvo" and its synonyms intrude about thirty times during this episode. That "uomo o . . . diavolo," and 20</page><page sequence="3">more likely a "satanasso," surrounds the angelic Lucia with a "realtà troppo somigliante a una funesta visione d'inferno," or, to believe the author, a reality reminiscent of Dante's Malebolge. The Innominato possesses "un demonio noscosto nel cuore," a "diavoleria," an "inferno,"« something which makes him react violently to the mere mention of God- "Dio, Dio, sempre Dio:...sempre...questo Dio da mettere in campo!" More subtly than Balzac, but with equal effectiveness, Manzoni's outlaw prides himself on "ardire e costanza," and deems it shameful to "mancare al suo assunto," which we can only assume as satanic. He is "magnifico" in a dark sense, "terribile" and "spaventevole"- and, contrary to Russo's judgment but closer to Momigliano's, the adjectives are not oratorical but representational.7 The chaplain's remark, then, that the Innominato was "mandato... [dal Diavolo]," punctuates the reader's awareness; it does not inform him. He is soon conscious of the difference with that other purveyor of maleficence, Don Rodrigo, for whom, in diametric contrast with the Innominato, evil was "un mezzo, non uno scopo."8 On this level, to see the Innominato in a separate category from Vautrin would reduce the issue to a matter of semantics. For the latter exists on a sphere of gratuitous desire, corruptio gratia corruptionis , which does not differ in kind from the implication in the Innominato's "scopo": "Je vis dans une sphère plus élevée que celle des autres hommes"; "j'aime le pouvoir pour le pouvoir." And the Innominato "non vedeva mai nessuno al di sopra disè, ne più in alto," and he acted "senz'altro interesse che il gusto di commandare." From their corresponding degree of "elevation," a further similarity between the two characters obtains. As emanations of evil, both are unnamed, Manzoni's character literally ("Di costui non possiam dire nè il nome, nè il cognome, nè un titolo, e nemmeno una congettura... [e] saremo costretti di chamar [lo] l'innominato"), and Balzac's by a series of incognitos: Jacques Collin, his real name, yields to Trompe la Mort, Vautrin, the Abbé Carlos Herrera, Saint Estève, William Barker, and Halpertius. Not unlike the case with Robert, there is a sense of ubiquitousness about them: the Innominato, "tiranno straordinario," whose fame had become "soggetto di racconti popolari, [il cui] nome significava qualcosa d'irresistible, di strano, di favoloso," spreads his tentacles of domination "in ogni parte del milanse"-that is, everywhere the epic takes place, and Vautrin, "professeur ès scélétatesses," keeps singing a telling song he leaves teasingly dangling: J'ai longtemps parcouru le monde, Et l'on m'a vu. . . In addition, again like Robert with his "retinue of the most wicked men in the territory. . . (and of) informers in all the cities," the Innominato commands from his "officina di mandati sanguinosi" an army of bravi and sgherri "dispersi e posti come a quartieri in vari luoghi de' due stati," just as Vautrin commands his secret legion, his "filibusters en gants jaunes," and he spans the continents symbolically by calling his servants Asie and Europe, and by dreaming of a plantation in America with slaves from Africa. In a true satanic context, "uno non poteva rimanere indipendente da lui," writes Manzoni about his character, the way Balzac could have written about his. The pact in blood had to be signed, or there existed a state of enmity. Yet both men remain isolated, as it were, not only because one is Public Enemy Number One, an escaped convict who must hide or conceal the identity of an "ignoble forçat," and the other "un aperto nemico della forza pubblica," who does not have to hide 21</page><page sequence="4">but simply had to "dar luogo e uscir dallo stato," but also because of their at once magnetic and fearsome statures, of the aura of dark majesty the authors create by not involving them directly in their world of terror. They direct the operations; they do not bloody their hands. Vautrin has young Taillafer killed, and through this one event (reported, at that) Balzac can make us think of an infinite number of similar crimes without specifying them, and Manzoni even more ominously speaks only of the Innominato's "mille delitti' and of no one in particular. Everything tends to remain in the vagueness of shadows, so that their conditions as exiles assume the proportions of apocalyptic fantasies.9 At this point we should note that the many similarities between Vautrin and the Innominato involve more the Innominato's intellectual and biographical background before the action oí I Promessi Sposi begins than the Innominato who takes part in the foreground of the novel's action. For while these similarities have a historical interest in that they reflect a peculiar orientation of Romanticism, the differences bespeak the special preoccupations of the respective authors. And substantively the differences outweigh the similarities. The more daimonic V autrin, in his "jeu de cache-cache," carries on a silent duel through the three novels with the forces of law and order, as incarnated successively in the expert lawmen Contenson, Corentin, and Peyrade. While in principle his opposition is philosophical, that is, theoretical, in practice and stated goals it is practical, that is, actual, which means that it is exercised on an antisocial plane. He wants to destroy society and recreate it in his own image, dominate it vicariously through his disciples Rastignac (who finally rejects him though he learns Vautrin's lesson well) and Rubempré (who succumbs). In various forms, he informs them (specifically, Rastignac) that "le siècle est mou," in the same spirit that he had informed Mme. Vauquer that society is "gangrenée." The anarchist holds that society's laws wear people out at different speeds, protests like Rousseau against the profound deceptions of the social contract, and looks upon himself as the immoralist obeying only the laws of nature. Laws are unstable; if they or their principles were fixed, "les peuples n'en changeraient pas comme nous changeons de chemise." There are not three judges who have the same opinion about one single article of law. Therefore, "il n'y a plus de lois, il n'y a que des moeurs," and if this is true only the law of power, physical or preferably economical, obtains. This is the perfect satanic message, out of which comes the perfect satanic practice: dupe men, "et je les roule," out of which in turn comes the perfect satanic advice: "Parvenir! parvenir à tout prix." Vautrin thus becomes "la figure du peuple en révolte contre les lois." In easy terms to understand, the obtaining principle suggests that only two alternatives exist for men: "ou une stupide obéissance ou la révolte." And Vautrin adds imperiously to Rastignac: "Je n'obéis à rien, est-ce clair?" We realize in retrospect that his spitting was more than a mannerism. Out of the ashes of insult and destruction Vautrin hopes to shape the new society under his hegemony, in the black glamor of complete negation, in opposition to the "order" of the Christ-like paternity of Goriot, whose passion symbolizes what the convict-philosopher-satan must destroy, the social nucleus, the family. For him, bluntness does not qualify as a manner of destruction. Surreptitiousness does-like that of the serpent who entered Eden to exploit Eve and deceive Adam. The crown of success is obtained in one of two ways. Vautrin explains: "Il faut entrer dans cette masse d'hommes comme un boulet de canon, ou s'y glisser comme une peste." Vautrin's way is the serpent's. H is absolute crime qualifies evil as a Fine Art, and thereby also fits the daimonic concept. He would like to see Rastignac, Rubempré, and Raoul de Frescas (if we take the play Vautrin into account), his own "creatures," follow the impulses of 22</page><page sequence="5">his new conditioning, as if they were self-propelling products of his rebel's psyche. At the very best, this would make them colorful~as distinguished from the insipid anonymity of the Goriots, the average, conforming men of the social unit who are the product of organic cautiousness. This is Vautrin's affreuse poésie. For him,Rubempré could be the incarnation of the "poème caressé par tant de poètes, par More, par Byron, par Mathurin, par Canalis, un démon possédant un ange attiré dans son enfer pour le rafraîchir d'une rosée dérobée au paradis." Paradise Lost is, for Vautrin, "l'apologie de la révolte," and the great poem he, Vautrin, could write would be "Y Iliade de la corruption," a kind of prologue to Milton's epic. If we start comparing the Innominato's intimate, initial profile with Vautrin's, we begin to notice dissimilarities in detail, which later expand to occasion a striking difference in the denouements of their dramas. With the Innominato, we feel equally absorbed in an atmosphere of ferocious mystery, but as we come to recognize that with him we have encountered once again an exceptional energy turned to evil, we feel less the philosophical, anarchical thrust of Vautrin than what Russo calls "a religious sense, despite his satanism."10 On the surface, he resembles his later Parisian colleague: "a forza di delitti, teneva per niente i giudizi, i giudici, ogni magistratura, la sovranità... .e voleva solo fare ciò ch'era vietato dalle leggi, o impedito da una forza qualunque; esser arbitrio, padrone negli affari altrui...; esser temuto da tutti...." But beneath the surface, we must surmise that part of the secret of this prominence lies in the disinterestedness by which he tends to rise above the restricted level of social rebellion into which Vautrin, despite his philosophy of corruptio gratia corruptionis , is nonetheless locked, if only because of the pragmatic realities of an escaped convict hiding from the law. Vautrin remains immersed in lawlessness, literally understood. Demoniacally, the Innominato can afford to be completely evil, in Machiavellian terms, with no ulterior, regenerative motive of recreation. If Vautrin is absolutely corruptive, the Innominato is absolutely destructive. When it comes to evil, there is a gratuitous extremism in his temperament which, in contradictory combination with his humanity (as we shall indicate later), constitutes a good portion of his seductiveness. Vautrin is a "mort civil" who aims at succeeding vicariously through his creatures, and at reigning over an inert, enslaved society, as symbolized by his dream of a slave-worked American plantation. The Innominato is a brutal condottiere who feels within him the flow of great energy and aims at destroying all around him because he sees it as meaninglessly inert. His anger has not the philosophical indignation of an observant anti-citizen, but rather the more personal quality of an invective against any and all who oppose him. What for Vautrin becomes a matter of art, of destructiveness for the purpose of re-creation or regeneration, for the Innominato becomes a matter of abstract, negative rectitude: through an almost Nietzschean ascension above good and evil, to replace evil with Evil and attain, not without a sense of reprobate vindictiveness, the primacy of absolute denial. He is "quell'uomo che aveva disposto a sangue freddo di tante vite, che in tanti suoi fatti non aveva contato per nulla i dolori da lui cagionati, se non qualche volta per assoporare in essi una selvaggia voluttà di vendetta...." It is in the subsequent profile, however, the one in the foreground of Manzoni's action during which the much discussed crisis and conversion occur, that the differences become paramount. Here the Innominato leaves the ranks of the titanic Romantic rebel. His imperious denial hardly means that he is more in control of his emotions and actions than Vautrin. The paradox is that, of the two, the latter is the more effortlessly volitional and unfailingly resolute. And the reasons for this are important. They have to do with the fact that Manzoni's 23</page><page sequence="6">character is more inner-directed and meditative, or shall we say psychologically oriented, than Balzac's, who is more outer-directed, active, and polemically oriented. Both sets of attributes characterize the Romantic temperament, as do both rebellions: the spiritual and the disputational, the metaphysical and the social. But the former comes closer to the existential concerns of the modern reader. Vautrin's outer conflict with society is ultimately his raison d'être; the Innominato 's social conflict turns out to be almost a metaphor of his inner conflict with his soul. The volitional Vautrin, for instance, would not need the psychological device the Innominato uses with himself when, in compliance with a request by Don Rodrigo to kidnap Lucia, he resolutely and quickly charges his most deft and flint-hearted ally, il Nibbio, with the task, "sentendo scemare quella fermezza che s'era commandata per promettere, sentendo a poco a poco venirsi innanzi nella mente pensieri che lo tentavano di mancare a quella parola. . . ." Nor would Vautrin feel a "no imperioso" and a "wo interno più imperioso del primo" surge within him, on two occasions, as the Innominato is about to give orders relating to Lucia's abduction. Inasmuch as the first profile of the Innominato resembles Vautrin more closely than the later,11 we might say that the social alienation of the one develops, through the germinating process of deep, inner inquietudes, into the metaphysical estrangement of the other. If at this point there is still rebellion, it is metaphysical, and is largely turned against himself. Somewhat like Camus' Caligula, he then gives vent to the open destructiveness of the demonic. This demonic drive of his, by attempting to disintegrate and destroy the finite, leaves open also the possibility, sooner or later, of admitting the concept of infinity, or eternity, in a way the daimonic Vautrin, who always seeks to refill the temporal void through corruptive reintegration, cannot. Thus a spiritual void is created in the Innominato, and his estranged conscience moves naturally toward inquietude and dread. As long as his concerns remain in Vautrin's temporal category, he does not understand and is unmoved by Lucia's plight; but when a sense of the eternal informs the situation~as it does through Lucia's simple, pious words-then the perspective changes. His will which had generally needed its own stratagems to contemplate its nihilistic goal and deflect the conscience (Manzoni refers to the Innominato's violence as "una specie d'autorita contro la coscienza"), submits to the potentiality of doubt, and the spiritual void prepares a crisis. Sentiment plays but a minor role in this crisis, which is intellectually motivated; furthermore, it is conditioned by a world-view which is much more metaphysical than physical, as is, at this point, his view of himself. He sees himself disassociated from any vital force, as if his whole individuality were being negated. Vautrin feels the same way, but easily finds his target: society-a target which proves too extrinsic for the Innominato, and which he leaves in the background. The Innominato's most telling symptom is that of solitude, "d'una solitudine tremenda." which Russo interprets not as the solitude of a man who has removed himself from the honest crowd, but that of a defenseless man before God12i-an idea Vautrin could never brook. Manzoni has prepared the reader psychologically for such a development, having encircled his character from the beginning in an aura of silent solemnity and remoteness. In this manner, a tragic sense of evil intrudes in his otherwise monolithic construct of denial, and his criminal past looms as immutable. The modern reader, used to the phraseology of existentialism, thinks of the Sartrian "we are the sum of our acts" when he comes across the following passage, a high point during the Innominato's nocturnal crisis: 24</page><page sequence="7">Indietro, indietro, d'anno in anno d'impegno in impegno, di sangue in sangue, di scelleratezza in scelleratezza: ognuna ricompariva all'animo consapevole e nuovo, separata da' sentimenti che l'avevan fatta volere e commettere; ricompariva con una mostruosità che que' sentimenti non avevano allora lasciato scorgere in essa. Eran tutte sue, eran lui: l'orrore di questo pensiero, rinascente in ognuna di quell'immagini, attaccato a tutte, crebbe fino alla disperazione. Eran tutte sue, eran lui : a clear indication of a spiritual travail, somewhat mysterious in origin but understandable for him whose "passione. . . non voleva più andare avanti" because he stands before a void, and also a clear invitation to anger. For the Innominato, used to attacking, resents being attacked (hence his self-indictment, "Non sono più uomo!"), being forced to reshape his life, to admit he is losing his grip and is heading for something that would belie "the sum of his acts." Like Tolstoy's Ivan Ilych on his deathbed (and the Innominato's had become similarly "duro duro," while he lay "rivoltandosi. . . sotto le coperte divenute pesanti pesanti"), "Tutto gli appariva cambiato. . . ." This is the sense of the void Momigliano understood well when he wrote literally of the Innominato's "agonia spirituale," and metaphorically of his "mare senza stelle." This is the sense of anguish that the metaphysical hero in a state of dissociation can never smother. In moments of weakness-though he has few, and only toward the end of his career when he is about to lose his creation, his alter-ego Ru bempré- Vautrin can only be guilty of fear. The Innominato experiences dread-the dread his fearing bravi witness in him in chapter XXIV, "quella paura in un animo come quello del loro padrone. . .," where paura means sgomento (for the Innominato was impervious to fear), and where sgomento is related to "una non so qual rabbia di pentimento" which gnaws at his conscience during the famous sleepless night.13 Like Orestes, he feels pursued by the Furies of his thoughts; his haste to leave Lucia imprisoned in her room, "in fretta e in furia, come se avesse avuto a trincerarsi contro una squadra di nemici," and to lock himself in his quarters, betrays a confusion between outer fear and inner dread, the confusion of self- deception, or bad faith, by which one exteriorizes an anxiety, or attempts to replace an intimate ill with an imaginary one. Equally self-deceptive are his resulting gestures of suicide, but these are curtailed by the Innominato's swelling metaphysical preoccupations. They are also curtailed by suicide's implicitly absurd answer to the explicitly absurd, by the repelling visions of his derided and uncared "cadavere sformato," and psychologically by the silent darkness of night: "Anche le tenebre, anche il silenzio, gli facevan vedere nella morte qualcosa di più tristo, di spaventevole. . . ." Even Vautrin, when defeated, does not yield to the negation offered by suicide. But while Vautrin behaves as if death obtains only for others, the Innominato internalizes the concept and makes it the stimulus of his conversion. Neither he nor Vautrin fears death physically; but the Innominato is acutely conscious of its metaphysical implication, of how it "veniva sola, nasceva di dentro," and of the tormenting mystery of the after-death. After the vision of the temporal (the people's surprise, what they will do with his body, the delight of his enemies) comes the concern with the eternal. "Invecchiare! Morire! e poi?" The Pascaban wager provides the needed logic, amid the confusion and doubt of suicide: "Se quell'altra vita di cui m'hanno parlato quand'ero ragazzo, di cui parlano sempre, come se fosse cosa sicura; se quella vita non c'è, se è un'invenzione de' preti, che fo io? perchè morire? cos'importa quello che ho fatto? cos'importa? è una pazzia la 25</page><page sequence="8">mia. . . E se c'è quest'altra vita. . .?" And in his estrangement, the former rebel realizes that he must make his peace with Eternity, "della quale non poteva fuggire neppur con la morte." That God, whose name had put him in a rage, is the only being he has to turn to in his solitude. The words could be taken from Ivan Ilych: Quel Dio di cui aveva sentito parlare, ma che, da gran tempo, non si curava di negare nè di riconoscere, occupato soltanto a vivere come se non ci fosse, ora, in certi momenti d'abbattimento senza motivo, di terrore senza pericolo, gli pareva sentirlo gridar dentro di sè: Io sono però. The strange thing that happens in this whole process of self-doubt and self- assessment is that, while one part-the old rebel part- of the Innominato's will retains its original diffidence of all non-temporal values, the other part-the recent one-allows these values to quell the pride of his violence in tacit recognition of the inalienable truth: 'To sono però." This last word rings as imperiously as anything the Innominato ever said in his imperious lifetime. The "però" sustains "quel nuovo lui , che cresciuto terribilmente a un tratto sorgeva come a giudicare l'antico." He becomes estranged from himself by acceding to the recognition of a reality outside of his own. Only in this way can the "nuovo lui" gradually overtake the old rebel, replace his pride with conscience, and his dread with light and peace. Ivan Ilych too struggled to get wholly inside the black sack at the bottom of which was light, and it was revealed to him that though his life had not been what it should have been, the situation could be rectified. Similarly, one could say at least figuratively that the Innominato is also on his deathbed; except that the colorless Ivan needed only the "Io sono" to see the light, while the imperious Innominato needs in addition the "però." Such existential travails in the face of the ultimate reality of death are unknown to Vautrin. The Lucifer of Paris is subject to the superior sway of natural law, which deals even this titan repeated blows. Balzac uses the image of iron rusting: "Le fer cède à certains degrés de battage ou de pression réitérée; ses impenetrables molécules...se désagrègent...[On dit alors que] Le fer est roui!" He is subject to these blows because of his disturbingly profound humanity: "Il y a du bon là, dit-il en se frappant le coeur....Je suis comme Don Quichotte, j'aime à prende la défense du faible contre le fort"; for him the only true feeling is "une amitié d'homme à homme," and Balzac concludes: "cet homme vraiment diabolique [se rattache] par l'amour a l'humanité." So observed, the natural law that smites him is what the Greeks called Fate. The Innominato's development, however, must be different; the "natural law" in his case is Providence. Therefore Vautrin ends his career in the Comédie Humaine a spent individual, fainting and weeping before Judge Camusot; the adverb "timidement" characterizes the fallen rebel's tone of voice. He becomes Saint-Estève, a policeman, another Vidocq, ultimately a magni nominis umbra. The same cannot be said of the Innominato, who becomes not only a Christian with sword in hand, but a courageous Christian leader-still consistent with one dimension of his background-"che.. .andava [sempre]...dalla parte dove eia indicato il pericolo." When Vautrin's daimonic urge, which perpetuates and reintegrates itself through the various Rubemprés for the purpose of social control or manipulation, collapses, it disappears. On the other hand, the demonic in the Innominato simply destroyed. No perpetuation and reintegration are involved. 26</page><page sequence="9">But through the destruction, it permits a new form to constitute itself, a form which has little or nothing to do with the previous form and which may be considered a metaphysical rebirth. . In this sense, conversion is a transsubstantiation. Balzac could not have permitted Vautrin, at the end of his career as rebel, to sustain the trauma of a conversion: the social alienation which lies at the base of his intellectual rebellion would not allow for a strong, convincing rebirth. A religious crisis in his biography would provide merely an expedient rationalization for his weakened body and mind and a convenient refuge in God stemming from his awareness of his own imminent collapse. What Russo says about the Conte del Sagrato,14 then, applies also to Vautrin: that such crises are egoistic and utilitarian in character, and result from weariness, but not from a conquering awareness of a metaphysical imperative. The kind of change we note in the Innominato can occur more readily in a demonic creature, which can annihilate itself in the wantonness of destruction, but which can, by the same token, leave open the possibility of birth from inside a void,16 with nothing more than a memory, or an echo, of the previous existence. The daimonic does not die. And when the demonic in the Innominato is broken down by existential dissociation and self-doubt, the rebirth is a transsubstantiation. Vautrin can only be perpetuated, let us say, recreated, but he cannot be transsubstantiated like the Innominato. Mephistopheles could make Faust into a creature in his own image, one of pleasure, lust, riches, and knowledge, but not into a creature against his own image, who attains salvation when he realizes that the greatest happiness in life comes through helping others. Again, Mephistopheles could only recreate. With the Innominato, however, whose initial social rebellion becomes metaphysical, the existential trauma adduces salvation. Hence from the heart of Romanticism, and complete with the Romantic trappings of outlawry and satanism, fearsome majesty and an atmosphere of storms and crags, Manzoni created a character who outgrew his presence in the novel and entered spiritually into our contemporary world of loneliness and dread, self-doubt and religious reconciliation. University of California , Riverside NOTES 1l use the term "metaphysical" here not only for the purposes of this essay through its juxtaposition with "social," but also because the commonly acknowledged historical dimension, for Manzoni, merely serves the psycho- religious dimension. The former is ancillary to the latter in a work in which all reality, however cruel, is lyricized, in that it finds its own niche in the overall spiritual pattern which characterizes the movement of life and the world. 2 Cf.

I have also explored the Innominato in Alessandro Manzoni (New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1976). 6 We count over fifty references, in the three novels, to Vautrin as devil, including his argot name as "boulanger": "diable supérieur," "démon," even "poète infernal," "puissance du vice," "infernal génie," "Satan," etc. We should note, too, Cardinal Borromeo's receiving the Innominato, who comes to visit him, as God will one day receive Lucifer back into the fold: "voi che. . .ho tanto amato e pianto, per cui ho tanto pregato; voi, de' miei figli, che pure amo tutti e di cuore, quello che avrei più desiderato d'accogliere e d'abbracciare. . ." 7Luigi Russo, p. 97, and Attilio Momigliano, Dante , Manzoni , Verga (Messina: Città di Castello, 1944). Russo's remark, ". . .ed anche l'imagine di Satana tradisce il terrore moralistico dello scrittore," restricts Manzoni's artistic liberty too conveniently within the confines of religious preoccupation. Granted that Balzac did not write something entitled Osservazioni sulla Morale Cattolica , but he was just as religious, and Catholic, as Manzoni, and his satanic epithets are, likewise, representational and far from purely oratorical. Russo's view of the "vecchio mal vissuto" as, again, oratorical shows little awareness of the lyrico- representational dimension of such word-symbols or symbolic episodes. In this sense, Russo's more analytical critical account is less satisfactory than Momigliano's more suggestive account, which is more attuned to what we might call the Romantic creative process. In the same vein, I should suggest that Russo's "Quei demòni e quegli angeli sono soltanto le parole mistiche, che ricorrono sulle nostre labbra e nella nostra fantasia, quando siamo profondamente turbati e noi incliniamo alla superstizione quasi fanciullesca degli idoli" (p. 106) is at best partially correct, for it overlooks the structural intricacies and the symbolic thrust of the novel. 8 The physical descriptions of the two characters correspond. The Innominato "Era grande, bruno, calvo; bianchi i pochi capelli che gli rimanevano; rugosa la faccia:. . .il contegno, le mosse, la durezza risentita de' lineamenti, il lampeggiar sinistro, ma vivo degli occhi, indicavano una forza di corpo e d'animo...." These same features could be attributed to Vautrin, except that he has (symbolic) red hair, and at times his eyes flash with the same color. As we know, Vautrin's features were drawn, in part, from the arch-criminal turned police commissioner, François Vidocq, who published his Mémoires in 1827, and whom Balzac met before he published Le Père Goriot 9 We should note that the loci , as described by the authors, abet the sense of apocalyptic fantasy: Paris as an "enfer" writhing in mustiness and corruption, and the Innominato's castle, "situato sul confine," usually under overcast skies, overlooking dangerous cliffs and crags, dark precipices, and tortuous paths mottled with lairs and boulders. 10 Luigi Russo, p. 74. 28</page><page sequence="11">11 In fact, we should call attention to the earlier version of Manzoni's novel and to the Innominato's counterpart (nicknamed Conte del Sagrato, because he had murdered in cold blood a man on the parvis of a church), whose wicked, anti- social behavior reminds us of Vautrin, although as a vicious and venal delinquent the Count hardly attains the magnetic stature of Vautrin. 12 Luigi Russo, pp. 80-81. Vautrin's "solitude" is at best explained by reason of his homosexual proclivity, which makes for much unfulfillment, and which led Proust to label Vautrin "la Tristesse d'Olympio de la pédérastie." 18 Russo does not see the dread in these terms, but he draws the parallel aptly with the poem Pentecoste: "Vi spira uno sgomento/Che insegni la pietà" (pp. 104 and 121). 14 Pp. 67-68. For the Conte del Sagrato, cf. fn. 11. 16 This is implicit in the phenomenon of chaos, as presented by Genesis. Light out of darkness is the philosophical message of Hugo's Les Misérables , in this sense an archtypal vision whereby Satan returns to God. Each in his own more or less dramatic way, the Innominato and Vautrin return to God, or at least to the Good. 29</page></plain_text>
