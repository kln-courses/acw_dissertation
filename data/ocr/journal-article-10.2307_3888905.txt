Box 30710, GPO 00100, Nairobi, Kenya E-mail: pilane@africaonline.co.ke (Received August 2005. Revised May 2006) ABSTRACT This paper examines some of the processes involved in theformation of household assemblages, their spatial patterning and transformation during the course of individual lifecycles in a single Dogon village during the 1980s. Attention is given to how these are linked to the reproduction of the domestic group. The focus is particularly on the lifecycles of women, since it is they who are most closely associated with the accumulation of household assemblages and their spatial and quantitative restructuring through time. In the concluding sections, however, the contrasts with the ideal lifecycles of men are examined. While in broad terms these can be seen to complement one another, they have quite different implications for how objects and space are distributed from one generation to the next. The wider implications of these patterns for understanding the formation of household assemblages are then discussed with reference to how artefacts and buildings are deployed in the social construction of memory. Keywords: Dogon, Mali, ethnoarchaeology, household assem- blages, site formation processes, memory. INTRODUCTION The causes of variation in the composition of household artefact assemblages have long been of concern within archae- ology. By and large, most early interpretations were based on two rather simple assumptions. First, that the composition and spatial patterning of objects on house-floors in archaeological contexts were a direct reflection of room function and/or the range of activities conducted within these dwellings during their occupancy. Second, that variations in artefact density and diversity between individual structures were a straightforward indicator of differences in the wealth and status of the occupants. Subsequently, and especially following the rise of ethno- archaeological research and the emergence of more explicit theorization during the era of the 'New Archaeology', such assumptions have been criticized and substantially revised (e.g. David 1971; Bonnischen 1973; Robbins 1973; Binford 1978, 1981; Moore 1982; Hayden &amp; Cannon 1983; Schiffer 1983,1987; Kent 1993). In particular, as the concept of 'site formation pro- cesses' and awareness of their potential effects on assemblage composition and patterning have become commonplace, few archaeologists would now expect such one-to-one relation- ships to hold.1 Despite this, debate over what Binford (1981) termed the "Pompeii premise", has encouraged a particular perspective on the nature of household assemblages and how they may be interpreted. This in turn has created the impression that the 'systemic' (pace Schiffer 1976) processes which affect the initial composition of household assemblages are, at best, only partially related to the processes of artefact discard, curation and recycling, and household maintenance and abandonment, that contribute to the formation of 'archaeological' assemblages (e.g. Schiffer et al. 1981; Hayden &amp; Cannon 1982). More specifically, a common presumption seems to have arisen that excavated assemblages recovered from house floors rarely, if ever, bear much corre- spondence to the assemblages that were hypothetically present when these structures were occupied. One consequence of this has been a shift towards the use of architectural features and components, rather than artefact assemblages, as the primary means of drawing social and economic inferences about the status of household occupants in both archaeological (e.g. Bowden 1982; Stanish 1989; Crocker 1985; Aldenderfer 1993) and ethnographic (e.g. Kramer 1979; Wilk 1983; Blanton 1993; Smith &amp; David 1995) studies. Although some scholars have put forward arguments in support of the continued use of house- hold assemblages as a source of social correlates (e.g. Smith 1987; Tobert 1988), as modelling of refuse-cycles at individual sites becomes more complex (e.g. Needham &amp; Spence 1997) and the application of soil micromorphology techniques to identify room use and activity areas becomes more wide- spread, it seems likely that the interpretative value of house- hold assemblages is destined to be diminished even further. This is principally because, as Hodder and Cessford have observed, there is a general premise that microartefacts "are more likely to represent traces of in situ activity than larger artefacts" (2004: 24), although as they go on to demonstrate this was not the case at gatalh6yfik. They argue instead that, just as with house floor assemblages, a multiple range of processes can affect the composition of microartefact and micromorpho- logical traces recovered from any particular context, and each needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis (see also Boivin 2000). It is certainly true that activities like refuse disposal, artefact curation and recycling, and the re-use of structures can all have qualitative and quantitative effects on the ultimate location and composition of deposited material. However, it is equally possible that the processes which seemingly lead to the 'deple- tion' of systemic assemblages are, in some sense, contingent on the motivations and aspirations that led individuals in the past to acquire and accumulate material possessions in the first place. To illustrate this point, in this paper I discuss the degree of variation in the composition of artefact assemblages between different houses in a single West African village occupied by subsistence farmers as observed in the early 1980s, and offer an explanation for the causes of this variability. In particular, I argue that quantitative and qualitative differences between assemblages can be attributed mainly to the relative position in the domestic cycle of the principal occupants of these different houses. Thus, for instance, houses occupied by older, senior women contained both numerically more items and more diverse artefact assemblages, than those occupied by younger,</page><page sequence="2">South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (183): 40-56, 2006 41 junior women at a different stage in their lifecycle. Yet, none of this patterning would receive any archaeological expression since on the vacation of a structure following death, out- migration, or some other cause the building is cleared of all artefacts down to, and including, large, re-usable potsherds. Whereas, in the light of the ethnoarchaeological studies cited above, this might be expected, it is my contention here that it is precisely because houses are cleared in this way that Dogon women pursue strategies aimed at accumulating material possessions during the course of their lives. In other words, there is a dialectical and recursive relationship between the systemic processes of assemblage creation and those which contribute to the formation of the archaeological record of the Dogon. While such claims may no longer seem especially radical (compared with when the research on which this paper is based was carried out), there remain remarkably few published studies that illustrate how and why such recursive relationships arise out of everyday practice (for a recent important exception, see Fewster 2006). It is this level of ethnoarchaeological detail concerning the specifics of one such example that I offer here. At the same time, the paper offers a radically different perspec- tive on the social meaning of village and household space within one Dogon community along the Bandiagara escarp- ment to that provided in the widely cited works of Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen regarding a claimed anthro- pomorphic symbolism of space (e.g. Griaule 1949,1965; Griaule &amp; Dieterlen 1954; cf G. Griaule 1955), which have in turn been subject to detailed critique elsewhere (e.g. Van Beek 1991; Lane 1997a). This said, I do not claim that the practices and beliefs I recorded in the 1980s were necessarily comparable to earlier beliefs and practices among the Dogon, and nor were they necessarily unique to the Dogon. THE DOGON The Dogon are sedentary agriculturists who inhabit an area lying between 14'-15'5'N and 105'-40W in east central Mali. The most prominent topographic feature of this area is the Bandiagara escarpment, an almost vertical sandstone cliff, between 180-270 m high. This runs diagonally southwest to northeast across the region for over 260 km. The cliff marks the edge of a wide sandstone plateau, which rises in the west from the alluvial flood plains of the River Niger. To the east of the cliff lies the vast, sandy Seno Plain (also known as the Plain of Gondo). Throughout the Dogon area there is considerable variation in the size and form of settlements. In the Sanga region, where most anthropological work has been conducted, settlement is in the form of nucleated villages, frequently of several hundred inhabitants (N'Diaye 1972; Huet 1994). The majority of these are of considerable antiquity, dating from the initial period of Dogon occupation during the 13th-15th century AD (Bedaux 1988; Gallay et al. 1995; Mayor et al. 2005). In the Seno Plain, on the other hand, there exist numerous single family homesteads and small hamlets of half a dozen or so compounds, as well as several larger villages (Brasseur 1968; Lane 1997b). Several of these settlements are between only 40 and 60 years old, whereas others date to before the Colonial era. A similar range of settlement types can also be found on the plateau west of the Bandiagara escarpment, where initial Dogon settlement appears to have begun after their settlement along the cliff (Mayor et al. 2005). This study is concerned exclusively with a single cliff-line village, Banani Kokoro, in the Sanga region, and as such, given the documented variation in settlement forms and composition it must be recognized that the following TABLE 1.

Dogon society is patrilineal and divided according to the principles of lineage segmentation into a variety of agnatic descent groups2. In terms of their genealogical structure, these are of progressively narrower span and shallower time depth. With the exception of the four so-called 'tribal' groupings, which represent the largest type of social unit, each of these has a theoretical spatial equivalent (Table 1). In addition, individual members of each level of segmentation are ranked hierarchi- cally according to the age seniority of their founder. While the genealogical and spatial groupings of village and ward have a particular significance in various settings, on a daily basis the lineage is by far the most important social grouping (Paulme 1940; Tait 1950). Minor lineages, stricto sensu, are called tire ginna, although in daily usage these are referred to simply as ginna. In certain instances, as a direct outcome of lineage fission, a minor lineage may be subdivided into a number of smaller groups, which are also known as ginna. Thus, in the village of Banani Kokoro in 1981-3, there were seven tire ginna, one of which was divided into three separate ginna, while another was divided into two such groupings (Table 2). Each ginna (i.e. minor or minimal lineage) functions as a more or less independent unit of production, consumption and reproduc- tion, and as such can be said to constitute the basic 'domestic' or 'household' group within Dogon society. In cliff-line villages, each ginna holds and controls rights of usufruct in agricultural land, which is farmed collectively by its members and the produce retained for their subsistence requirements. Overall responsibility for the management of this land and other physical resources such as dwelling space rests with the lineage head, or ginu baya.

SOCIAL CATEGORIZATION OF RESIDENTIAL SPACE Unlike in many other parts of West Africa, the members of a particular ginna do not occupy, to sleep in, a single compound but instead utilize several lineage-owned dwelling spaces. These are both dispersed throughout the patrilineal settlement (Fig. 1) and also beyond its bounds in the Seno Plain. The configuration of the 'domestic group' is thus one of extreme spatial dispersion, and is of a pattern rarely envisaged in archaeological analyses of the household. Moreover, residential groupings can be either male- or female-headed, according to context, and all potentially include 'secondary' members, such as dependent children, grandchildren or nephews. The majority of these 'secondary' members are linked either agnatically or by affiliation, to the descent group that has rights of usufruct over these compounds. These divisions can therefore be said to serve as spatial referents of the internal divisions of a descent group. The number of compounds, including vacated ones, owned by the respective lineage groups in the study village of Banani Kokoro as recorded in 1981-3, is summarized in Table 2. As this shows, all lineages owned at least two compounds and the maximum held by a single ginna was fifteen. The virilocal rule of post-marital residence, in combination with the devel- opmental cycle of the lineage group, effectively determine the demographic composition of each compound. The residential groupings which these principles generate can be distin- guished from each other according to the age, gender and marital status of the principal occupants. In all, the Dogon distinguish four categories, as follows: ginu na (or more coloquially, ginna) These are compounds occupied by the lineage head and various dependants such as his wife or wives, and any pre- adolescent children and grandchildren. Male children will move out after they have been circumcised (typically between 8 and 12 years), female children will move out once they reach puberty (e.g. nos 3 &amp; 25, Fig. 1). ginu sala These are generally occupied by married men with their wife or wives and dependent infants (i.e. below the age of weaning). In some circumstances, however, ginu sala compounds may also be occupied by divorced men, with or without dependent children, and by married women whose husbands are living away from the village for some reason (usually because they are working as wage-labourers outside the region) (e.g. nos 1, 20 &amp; 37, Fig. 1). ya:na peney duqoy These are compounds in which the principal resident is a widowed woman; however, widows also frequently share their dwelling space with teenage (i.e. post-pubescent) girls who are either unmarried or who have yet to move into their husband's compound (this is normally after the birth of the couple's first child, but may even be delayed, especially with first marriages, until after the birth of their third child) (e.g. nos 10, 28, Fig. 1). sagada:rau duioy These are compounds used by unmarried, circumcised adolescent and young adult males (e.g. nos 14, 19, Fig. 1). These indigenous social categorizations of dwelling space resemble the kind of divisions made by many other West African societies, but unlike the majority of these they are given physical expression in the form of separate 'compounds', each with its own suite of structures. This contrasts with the more common strategy of simply adding additional'houses' within a single compound so as to accommodate the changing residen- tial demands of the kin group (see e.g. Archer 1971; David 1971; Schwerdtfeger 1971; Fletcher 1977; Smith &amp; David 1995). Hence, in the study village the number of compounds belong- ing to each category at any time will depend on the size of the different lineages - the more married men and women and fewer 'unmarried' young men there are in a village, so the more compounds there would be that were conceptualized as 'ginu sala' and the fewer categorized as 'sagada:rau durtoy'. However, since only one of a lineage's compounds is termed ginu na, the number of compounds categorized thus by Dogon provides an accurate indication of the number of recognized lineage group- ings. Table 3 provides a summary of the number of compounds belonging to each category, and the marital status of their prin- cipal occupants in Banani Kokoro at the time of this study. One problem archaeologists would face, if trying to recon- struct the social structure of this Dogon settlement, is that there are very few architectural clues that can be regarded as diag- nostic of a particular residential category. This is partly because most compounds, irrespective of their residential composition, contain a similar range of houses, granaries for storing crops and personal possessions, courtyard features such as hen coops, goat pens, food processing areas and so on, and are all typically demarcated by a dry stone wall with normally only a single entrance (Figs 2 &amp; 3). There is also a degree of variation in the number and form of houses and granaries in any particular compound, and also a nominal indigenous categorization of granaries on both gender and functional lines (see N'Diaye 1972; Lane 1986a; Huet 1994, for further details). Generally, these were not found to correlate in practice with any particular age, gender, marital or other social category recognized by the Dogon, with the notable exception of the tall rectangular</page><page sequence="4">South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (183): 40-56, 2006 43 PLAN OF BANANI KOKORO PCJNULU lNUINU PUJNULU DIDIU 14 H o u s e P er s onl ..1 11n9 322 To 37...- de TAI~~ HOus esnlRie _ 3_ 1SIJ (form 1) Q granary I t structure N [ I I~~~~~ ~ House Dry stone Wooden LL(form 2) walling planking 0 5 10 metres 0i Millet XiSandstone Sharp break| Scale lgranary b oulder in slopel FIG. 1.

Viwo1aaiKkoo19 htgrp:Pu ae granaries used for storing millet, the staple crop, which in the majority of cases were found only in ginu na compounds. The majority of ginu na compounds also had covered porches at the entrance to the compound; but this was not always the case and this architectural feature was also present at one ginu sala compound. It should also be noted, and in contrast to Griaule's well-known anthropomorphic model (1965; Griaule &amp; Dieterlen 1954), none of the houses in the ginu na compounds in Banani Kokoro had an outer faqade composed of a series of rectangular niches. This architectural feature was present, however, at one compound in the adjacent village of Banani Amu, which is regarded as being structurally senior to Banani Kokoro and the first of the Banani villages to have been founded. One aspect to ginu na compounds which might make them more archaeologically distinct is that compared with all other categories of compounds, the house, millet granaries and the overall compound space are preferentially curated and subject to regular maintenance. In contrast, the other categories of compounds belonging to a lineage when not in use for a period of time are often left to collapse, and village space along the Bandiagara escarpment typically comprises a combination of occupied compounds with well-maintained structures, and those which are either in a state of collapse or lie in ruins. An archaeological signature of ginu na compounds, therefore, might be the greater age of the buildings it contains relative to those found in other compounds. As discussed elsewhere (Lane 1994), because ginu na compounds are reserved for the lineage head, and because lineage heads are always the oldest living male member of the kin group, so an intriguing correla- tion is established whereby the oldest living male in a lineage always resides in the oldest extant dwelling space belonging to that lineage. This does not mean that the ginu na compound is not used by other lineage members. In fact, as well as being the place of residence of the lineage head it is also regarded as the appropriate venue for a range of lineage-related routines, that include crop storage, the preparation and consumption of daily meals, lineage-based rituals, ancestor veneration and childbirth. One consequence of the specific combination of these practices is that the ginu na compound comes to stand as a potent material symbol of not just the durability of the lineage but also for its past history. Hence, it is no coincidence that in everyday speech the term ginu na is concatenated so that it becomes 'ginna', in other words precisely the same word as used to describe the kin group it represents. In contrast, the remaining compounds belonging to a mini- mal lineage are used by a wide range of other lineage members and are categorized according the marital position of their principal occupant, as set out above. Because these categories are linked to different stages in the lifecycles of men and women, the classification of different compounds is always subject to change in response to changes in the demographic composition of the compound occupants. Thus, for instance, a ginu sala compound might become vacant on the death of its principal occupant, whereupon it might be used to provide housing for either a young, unmarried adult male member of the lineage or for an elderly, widowed female member. In the former case, this compound would be now regarded as a sagada:rau duqoy, whereas in the latter case it would become a ya:na peney duioy. Some years later, after a further change in the residential composition of this compound, it could quite easily revert to being a ginu sala. Furthermore, when the social com- position of a compound changes there are also related changes, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to the composition of</page><page sequence="6">South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (183): 40-56, 2006 45 ea h . .... /XW gono t; / g 5 ~~~~~eat here, 0 0 0 5 m CG~~~~~D CG = o C31 pggonoM 0 5m~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ h~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 6G 6G3Eapofagnneatbgnslcm udKe1s=fswfshshere2 =scnwfshs/aa;B anabr G = ersnalgraary MG= dmlle soaernyf=a nimlodr okn erh evn om otr ete;p=ptigeupet s wshngaea t= grcltra tol;w freod;goo cutyrdspce hain =fisf~orrom</page><page sequence="7">46 South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (183): 40-56, 2006 household artefact assemblages. As discussed below these changes can be related directly to different strategies deployed by men and women to ensure the memory of their identity following their death. In essence, whereas men rely more on the physical structure of village space as the primary means of memorialization, women invest in the accumulation of material possessions as their principal means of memory making, as these are passed on as heirlooms to their female agnates after their death. These contrasting strategies, under- standably, have rather different archaeological consequences. HOUSEHOLD ASSEMBLAGES AND THE DOMESTIC CYCLE In broad terms, household artefacts can be found in any one of three categories of 'domestic' space, namely within houses, inside or on the outer wall of personal granaries, and in the courtyard space of compounds. In 1981, a study was made of the spatial distribution of household possessions in a sample of 53 houses from 33 compounds. This sample was augmented in 1982-3, with data from a further six houses, whose occupants had changed since the 1981 field season. Data collection entailed plotting the location of each object within individual rooms or within compound space (including those stored above ground surface such as in house rafters and on house walls), recording details of the object type and function, owner- ship, Dogon name, date, means and place of acquisition, and in selected cases artefact history. Additional details concerning the names, ages and genealogical relationships of the occupants of each compound were recorded at the same time as plans of the compounds and each house interior were made. Except in a very few circumstances, access to granaries used for storing personal possessions was denied, thereby reinforcing the claim made by Dogon that these are very private spaces, which even a spouse, sibling, offspring or other close kin cannot enter without express permission. The absence of these data from the following analysis should be noted. However, I do not believe that the lack of information concerning granary contents has unduly affected the overall results, principally because in the random sample of personal granaries to which access was granted, those used by either men or women, whose houses contained comparatively few objects also contained relatively few material culture items. In contrast, the granaries used by elderly women, like their houses, were typically stuffed with personal possessions. In other words, the impression I gained was that had access been granted to all personal granaries, just as it was to all but a few houses, then a similar patterning would have been documented. Other researchers may have collected data that contradict this, however. A total of 243 different artefact types, excluding different items of clothing, were noted in the study village; this contrasts with the 550 types recorded by Bedaux and his co-workers in Tirelli (Bedaux 1986: 241). Of these, 72 per cent (n = 175) were categorized as 'local', i.e. items made by the Dogon or by members of adjacent communities. The remaining 68 types originated from outside the immediate region, and included those made in towns such as Mopti, and all goods of industrial origin. These were categorized as 'non-indigenous'. Most houses contained a similar range of artefacts associated with different tasks such as cooking pots, stone querns, calabashes and gourds, and water-pots, as well as sleeping mats, items of clothing and an assortment of different kinds of storage container. Other types of object such as beer-brewing and beer-serving vessels, agricultural tools and weapons had a more noticeably restricted distribution. Some of the houses, or individual rooms within houses, appeared to be crammed full of objects, many of them broken and unusable, along with collections of gourd- and pot-sherds, old torch batteries, tin cans, scraps of cloth and the odd shoe or sandal. Other rooms, and sometimes entire houses, were virtually empty of posses- sions (Fig. 4a-e). Some seemed to be neatly arranged and well swept, while others gave the appearance of being rarely used (see Lane 1986a for details). In dwellings where women were resident, most of the objects within a house, on the whole, belonged to them. By this is meant that they either had purchased, made, or had been given these items. There are, nevertheless, certain artefacts which are retained by men in the event of a separation, even though these may be less frequently used by men than by women. These are water pots, stone querns and, frequently but not invariably, wooden mortars and beer brewing and serving pots. For the most part though, in those houses where women are absent, the bulk of the objects can be said to belong to the male resident or residents. Conversely, although certain objects are indisputably male items, such as all weaponry, a widow may sometimes keep some items that belonged to her husband until her death, when they will be inherited by his sons. Overall, there was a great diversity in appearance and yet a striking similarity in the contents of houses. More specifically, most houses contained small quantities of a great number of different objects, ranging in material from wood and metal to stone and leather. A few houses (8%), however, contained larger quantities of pots, gourds and calabashes, and also, to a lesser degree, straw objects. Likewise the majority of houses (76 per cent) contained less than 100 objects (approximately equal numbers contained 0-49 objects as those with 50-99 items). Twenty-two per cent contained between 100 and 199 artefacts and only one had over 200 individual items (cf the data given in van Beek &amp; van der Waals 1986: 74). Within the two broad density groupings there was, however, considerable variation. Artefact numbers also varied from room to room within a house, as well as between houses. However, the presence of additional rooms, or their absence, did not have a causal effect on densities, since there were cases of both house forms having either high and low overall artefact densities. Given that objects were in use, over time individual items, almost inevitably, were moved about both within the individ- ual houses, courtyards and granaries, and also between them. In 1982-3, during a second season of fieldwork, attempts were made to document some of these trends by making a series of repeat visits to a sample of compounds, so as to compile new inventories and document the changes in the spatial distribu- tion of objects. The visits were timed so as to monitor the poten- tial effects of various temporal cycles that have a bearing on routine practice among the Dogon. Particular attention was given to the effects of the weekly cycle, which is structured according to a five-day market cycle, and seasonal variations (essentially, 'wet' and 'dry' seasons). These studies highlighted a number of trends, and especially the periodic reorganization of artefact distributions within houses in response to changing spatial demands and household activities (see Lane 1986a, for details). Overall, however, such changes at the level of 'routine time' (which here is understood to encompass everyday practice, pace Giddens 1979) had a minimal effect on the composition of assemblages. That is, whereas objects tended to be moved between different rooms and other spaces, over the course of sixteen months there was very little evidence for significant supplementation or depletion of the composite assemblages found within the individual compounds and their associated houses and granaries.</page><page sequence="8">South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (183): 40-56, 2006 47 a) sagadaxrau dunoy b iusl IC)0 0 c) ginu na 0 C1Oe) i (,artt~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Hat 9 LAmihlofmat adlal,181 (sgd1a dny;()yon md2s)mrid2 P fu couple, 2931 8wo irfants, 1981 (ginu sala); (c) married, senior wife of 9 .

Far more significant were the quantitative and qualitative differences in assemblage composition between houses occupied by individuals at different stages in their lifecycle, and the contrast between houses used by adult women, whether married or widowed, and those used by men. In broad terms, the data tend to suggest that younger individuals, who are at an earlier stage in their lifecycle, have fewer possessions than their elders (Fig. 5; Table 4), and also that as women grow older they accumulate many more objects than their male peers such that at the end of their lives they live literally surrounded by their possessions (Fig. 6a). Whereas, the houses used by their male equivalents can appear quite bare (Fig. 6b). In the absence of time series data for the village, these data provide a useful insight into the changes associated with 'generational time'. At one level, the marked qualitative and quantitative differ- ences between the houses occupied by individuals at different stages in their life-cycle are unsurprising. Similar trends have been noted among groups as diverse as subsistence cultivators in Cameroon (Lyons 1998), Marakwet agro-pastoralists (Moore 1986, 1987), specialist potting and blacksmithing craft-castes in Sudan (Tobert 1988), merchants and lesser gentry in eighteenth century Lancashire (Vickery 1993), and suburban household- ers in the U.S.A. (Schiffer et al. 1981). In her comparative study of architecture and the use of space among Bozo, Senufo and Bamana groups in Mali, Walicka Zeh recorded a number of similar trends. For instance, she found that among Senufo "bachelor houses are very sparsely furnished" (2000: 268); and TABLE 4.

In all of these cases, one probable explanation for the increased level of ownership of material possessions among individuals as they get older is due to their increased economic power over time, and by implication increasing relative wealth. This is certainly the case among Dogon women, most of whom as they reach middle age are engaged in one form or another of petty market activity (such as making beer or pots, or producing vegetables, for sale). At the same time, they are also able to command the labour of their juniors, specifically that of their daughters and the wives of their married sons, so as to free themselves from certain routine lineage-based tasks and thus create time for their own personal market-oriented activities. This in itself, however, does not explain why women make the choices they do so as to acquire more possessions, rather than using their labour and capital in other ways. Neither is it a sufficient explanation as to why men seemingly do not pursue similar strategies (it is of interest to note here that Walicka Zeh (2000) found that compound size rather than material possessions were the best indicator of wealth differences between lineages among Senufo and Bamana, whereas among Bozo the best index was the number of boats owned). To understand the reasons for such differences, it is necessary to turn to a consideration of the issues of inheritance and the roles played by material culture and architecture in the construction of individual and collective memory.

Photographs: Paul Lane. householder (especially one who was elderly), and a subse- quent change in occupancy. Soon after a woman dies, her affinal kin in consultation with her agnates will begin assem- bling all the deceased's material possessions. Extreme care is taken by her affines to ensure that every item is collected, even broken and seemingly disused objects. This is done so as to pre-empt accusations from the woman's agnatic kin of mistreatment and/or misappropriation. As part of the burial rituals, three items belonging to the deceased - a small gourd, a spindle and her sa tonyo (a type of pot used for storingbody oil), are collected and deposited at the edge of the cemetery where the deceased is buried. This is carried out for every adult woman buried; there is no comparable practice for all men, although if the deceased happened to have been a weaver then his weav- ing shuttle will be deposited close to the deposit of female artefacts (see Lane 1986a; Bedaux &amp; Lane 2004, for details). After her burial, which should normally take place within 24 hours of her death and takes place at her natal rather than her affinal village, the deceased woman's possessions are divided among her female agnatic kin according to her wishes as to which kinswoman should inherit which items. A propor- tion of these possessions, notably those the deceased consid- ered to be her 'finest', are subsequently displayed by her female kin as part of the funeral rituals performed for the deceased in the coming months (Fig. 7). As with burial practices, there is no comparable element to male funeral or spirit-raising (dama) cer- emonies, which instead, place much greater emphasis on the age-status and specialist roles of the deceased (Griaule 1939), than do those performed for women. All of the Dogon women who were interviewed on this topic, explained that it was im- portant that their most treasured possessions were displayed in this way and subsequently inherited by their sisters, daugh-</page><page sequence="11">50 South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (183): 40-56, 2006 FIG. 7.

It was also clear from these interviews that Dogon women had considerable emotional attachment to the objects they accumulated during the course of their lives. They rarely had any difficulty recalling when, how and from whom they had obtained an object, or when they themselves had made it, and in most houses items that were several decades old, such as pots, pieces of cloth and items of jewelry, were recorded during the household contents census (for similar observations in relation to pots, see Bedaux 1986; Bedaux &amp; van der Waals 1987). In many ways, these artefact histories told the stories of the women's lives - from who they were related to, which friends and kin had given them gifts and which places they had visited or lived in, to the important events in their lives that had been marked by the exchange of objects, and their efforts, over the years, to feed and clothe their children. What made it important for Dogon women in the study village to invest so much of themselves in their material posses- sions, however, was because, unlike men, the 'official' histories as represented by lineage genealogies provided little scope for the memory of their individual identities. Specifically, whereas the names of the female members for the last two or three generations of a particular patrilineage could generally be recalled, beyond this, memory of the names of wives, sisters and daughters of the male lineage ancestors was much more selective. Equally, despite their close practical association with houses and compounds, women have no legal claim on domestic space and throughout the course of their lives women are moved from one such space to another in response to male strategies. For instance, when they reach puberty, get married, bear children, get divorced, become the wife of a lineage head, and when they die. Men, on the other hand, follow a trajectory through space-time which has as its logical conclusion residence in their lineage's ginu na compound. As summarized above, through selective maintenance and curation this is a powerful symbol of lineage continuity, and as such men can be said to move into space during their lives, whereas women are moved through it to such an extent that a woman's body is normally returned from her affinal village (where she may well have spent most of her adult life) to her agnatic village for burial (Lane 1987, 1994). Moreover, compounds, and the houses they contain, are perceived as male spaces, and the sequence in which individual compounds belonging to a lineage were added and the names of their builders can often be recalled going back several generations. The durability of domestic architecture thus ensures that there will be tangible traces of a man's identity long after his death. It is the desire for a parallel 'material history', which ultimately motivates Dogon women to accumulate and curate material possessions over the course of their lives, even if, after their death their physical presence in their husband's settlement is literally erased by the transfer of their body to their natal village for burial and the removal of their possessions from their former home (Fig. 8a,b). CONCLUSION In this paper, I have discussed some of the factors which in the 1980s encouraged individual Dogon in Banani Kokoro, and most especially women, to accumulate material possessions over the course of their lives. In particular, it has been suggested that Dogon women used these objects as a means of securing memory of their individual identity among, at the very least, their close female affinal kin. Dogon men, in contrast, appeared to place less emphasis on the use of heir- looms as a way of memorializing their individual identity. The reasons for this, I suggest, were partly because of the general representation of village space as being a male domain,5 through which women are moved during the course of their lives. As discussed above, this specific evaluation of space also gives rise to the selective curation and maintenance of ginu na compounds as symbols of the continuity, prosperity and identity of the patrilineage (see also Lane 1994). Thus, for men, the spatial fabric of the village rather than their household possessions plays a crucial role in the construction of their collective memory. In contrast, there are few if any material forms through which a woman's identity is sustained by her affinal kin. However, as argued above, it is precisely the very</page><page sequence="12">South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (183): 40-56, 2006 51 a) 2023Fiewo (Iii) ~ ~~~Large - -------------- Sherd 17 15 0 2m Large X sherds 0 12m FIG. 8.

Unfortunately for the archaeologist, as is also apparent from Fig. 8, it would be impossible to discern all this from an analysis of the remains of Dogon houses if some were to be excavated in the future. In other words, we are faced with something of a paradox - the processes which encourage women to accumulate material possessions during their lives, are the very same ones which result in a negligible 'archaeolog-</page><page sequence="13">52 South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (183): 40-56, 2006 + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~140( 1 1~~~~~~~~~~~~1 I 2m \II2O FIG. 9.

Indeed, the single published example of the patterning of artefacts on the floor of an excavated house at Hamdallahi, the 19th century capital of the Fulani Massina empire (Fig. 9), bears a striking resemblance to that recorded in one of the houses in Compound No. 3 (Fig. 8b), following the death of its elderly, widowed occupant a few months earlier. While this suggests that the practices recorded in Banani in the 1980s could have some time depth to them, it could also be argued that the similarity between the two contexts only reinforces the reasons why archaeologists are reluctance to use house floor assemblages to make infer- ences about the social identity of the former occupants. However, the matter is not quite as simple as that. First, the objects that are distributed among a woman's agnatic kin as heirlooms ultimately do end up entering the archaeological record, especially as the majority of such heirlooms are every- day items which those who inherit them, continue to use. This applies even to items which from a Western perspective might be regarded as no longer functional, as is clearly reflected in the composition of Dogon household and compound inventories (Bedaux &amp; Lane 2004), and also by the mean ages of certain pot types, such as the large beer brewing and storage vessels (dei, dadema), some of which found in houses in Sanga (Bedaux 2003) and Banani (Lane 1986a) are said to have been between 70-90 years old. In due course, however, even these items are gradually discarded, initially as domestic rubbish that is allowed to accumulate within the compound. In turn, this is either disposed as household sweepings dumped immediately out- side compound walls, or as manure (pandaga) collected up from different compounds and carried out to lineage-owned fields at the foot of the escarpment. Although not as heavily symboli- cally loaded7 as the types of household refuse generated by, for example, the Marakwet of Kenya (Moore 1986), artefact discard among these Dogon communities is clearly influenced by the cultural emphasis Dogon women place on artefact curation as a means of memorializing their specific identities. Consequently, over the long term, one might expect (and this could be tested by detailed typological seriation), that the artefact assemblages generated by compound maintenance and manuring practices would appear to be, chronologically, quite mixed. The formation of the archaeological record of Dogon activities is thus not simply a matter of physical and biochemical processes, but is also contingent on several interpretative readings of the past. Second, not all societies deploy the same mechanisms to ensure individual or collective memory even when they resemble each other in some other respects, as the following examples from the same general area as the Dogon help illus- trate. For instance, the Senufo of southern Mali, who have rather similar social institutions to the Dogon and like the Dogon (but unlike groups such as the Bozo and Bamana) their households do not form "distinct residential units or com- pounds" (Walicka Zeh 2000: 260), are reported to take all the household possessions belonging to an individual on his or her death to specific family localities on the edge of their village, where the objects are then deliberately broken and laid in a pile. Over time, these deposits, if not disturbed by natural pro- cesses, can develop into obvious mounds. Moreover, it is even possible that the low tumuli found at sites such as Zampia and Wind6 Koroji in the Southern Gorma region of Mali, several hundred kilometres to the north of where the Senufo live today and dated to around 900-540 cal BC, may have been created in a similar fashion (MacDonald 1998: 85-91). At the mid-first to</page><page sequence="14">South African Archaeological Bulletin 61 (183): 40-56, 2006 53 early second millennium AD site of Tongo Maare Diabal near Douentza to the north of Banani, on the other hand, archaeo- logical evidence from excavations indicates that houses were repeatedly re-built on the same spot for approximately 800 years or more (Kevin MacDonald, pers. comm. 2005; on Tongo Maar6 Diabal see also Walicka Zeh 2000; Bedaux et al. 2004: 41-2). It is quite possible therefore, that architectural space was used as means of inscribing collective memory in a rather simi- lar fashion to the selective curation of lineage compounds among the Dogon. However, in contrast to the situation in Banani (and seemingly also at the site of Hamdallahi), the majority of excavated houses appear not to have been cleared of possessions before being rebuilt. Instead, in at least seven cases, the walls were knocked down so as to seal a select group of artefacts, the wall debris was then levelled off at c. 0.5 m above the former floor and the house rebuilt (ibid.). Thus, one contemporary community, like the Dogon, remove objects from the houses of the deceased, but instead of the objects being used to ensure personal memorialization through their selective curation as heirlooms, the objects are deliberately discarded so as to create special deposits, which in time can become visible features within the landscape. Conversely, an archaeological community that occupied at least part of the area now inhabited by Dogon, like the latter appear to have favoured the long-term curation of houses as one means of remembering the dead but, and in contrast to the Dogon, their memorialization strategies appeared to have entailed the delib- erate destruction of selected objects as well. This tendency to demolish the personal possessions and/or the houses of the recently deceased is also reported to have been practiced in the past among the Haya of northwest Tanzania (Weiss 1997) and the Kaguru in central Tanzania (Beidelman 1991), among others. Although such actions are often represented as a means of 'forgetting the dead', as Weiss has argued specifically in connection with the Haya, they are perhaps better understood as a way of 'casting out death'. By removing the deceased's possessions from circulation, such actions "render them inalienable from the person who once had possessed them" (Weiss 1997: 170, emphasis in the original), and in so doing lay the foundations for the memorialization of the deceased. The Senufo practice is somewhat similar, in that the reason given to explain the discard of the deceased's possessions is so that the dead cannot use them to re-enter the world of the living (Kevin MacDonald, pers. comm. 2005). Similar examples of the deliberate destruction of possessions and buildings (or reliance on their relative susceptibility to the natural processes of decay) belonging to the recently deceased have been noted in other geographical contexts and for other time periods. Rowlands (1993, following Kilchler 1987), has suggested that societies which habitually employ such practices should be distinguished from those which place greater emphasis on the preservation of objects as a means of cultural transmission. In the latter types of society, Rowlands argues, the acts of artefact curation and inheritance should result in artefact style being rather conservative over time since older objects are continually available for future generations to copy (see also Lillios 1999: 252). In societies where the emphasis is on the physical destruction of cultural material, on the other hand, there is inevitably greater reliance on the recollection of the images of objects seen in the past, and hence a greater potential for stylistic change. It is also apparent that the lDogon, like other peoples, not only draw on the material traces of human activity around them in their construction of a past, but also make a number of assessments of the relative historical value of these traces which affect their potential survival for future generations. This appears to operate at several levels and to encompass different temporal structures of Dogon society. The data dis- cussed in this paper relate primarily to individual biographical time and the concern Dogon women have regarding continua- tion of their memory among future generations. The selective conservation of ginu na compounds associated with lineage heads, since they are repetitively and exclusively occupied by successive lineage heads, relates more to issues of generational time (Lane 1994), as do lineage histories and genealogies. Other aspects of Dogon practice and belief refer to mythical time, encompassing both Dogon and pre-Dogon phases. It is these latter activities which typically involve the re-use and appro- priation of 'archaeological' sites and materials. Examples include the use by cliff-line Dogon villagers of Tellem (c. llth-15th century AD) localities perched high up on the cliff-face of the Bandiagara escarpment as cemeteries for the disposal of their dead (Bedaux 1988), as well as the periodic incorporation of Tellem wooden sculptures (Dieterlen 1965) and footed bowls (Bedaux 1980), and even miniature 'Neolithic' polished stone axes or 'hachettes' (personal observation 1992/3) into various categories of Dogon shrines. Another practice possibly related to this is the re-plastering of iron smelting furnaces that is said to have taken place after successive smelts (see Huysecom and Agustoni 1997; http://archeo.unige.ch/ inagina/). Finally, these observations also have more general signifi- cance for the interpretation of archaeological sites, assemblages and materials. Specifically, decisions such as those entailing repair, modification, replacement, curation, preservation or disposal are not just driven by utilitarian concerns, but also draw on cultural understanding of the historical value of the object or building in question. Archaeological study of continu- ities and changes to these mundane practices over the long- term, therefore, may well have as much potential to provide insights into the nature of historical practice in past societies as is now recognized can be gained from the analysis of burials, funerary monuments and sacred landscapes (e.g. Lane 1986b; Williams 1998; Van Dyke &amp; Alcock 2003). Since these practices are not unique to the Dogon, a logical extension of this argument is that the archaeological record of past societies must also have been structured by their own cultural concepts of time and 'the past' (Lane 1996, 2005; Bradley 2002). Under- standing the diversity of such concepts and their cross-cultural similarities should be one of the broader goals of the discipline in the 21st century.

NOTES 1As an example of these shifts in perspective, see the changing ap- proaches to the interpretation of house units at the Iron Age lake village at Glastonbury in southwestern England, beginning with Bulleid and Gray's initial interpretation (1911), through David Clarke's well- known model (1972) to the more cautionary assessments by Coles &amp; Minnitt (1985) and Barrett (1987). 2Although written in the present tense, the following overview of Dogon socialization, practices and beliefs refers to the situation as encountered in cliff-line villages in the vicinity of Sanga during the early 1980s. The account makes no claim to being representative of beliefs and practices in other parts of Dogon territory, and I fully recog- nize that the situation in my main research villages may well have changed significantly during the intervening twenty years or so since the work was carried out. 3Key and detailed inventory for Fig. 4.
