<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Unnoticed Finds of Iconographic Interest by N. P. Joshi Some important and interesting material for the study of early Brahmanic iconography still lies buried in the basements and cellars of different museums, awaiting fresh inter? pretation and consideration in the light of literary evidence. A few such images which were seen and studied by the author during recent years are described and discussed below. 1 - Fourfold Figure of Yaksa (figs. 1-4). From Bhlta; c. 2nd cent. B.C.; 66 X 20 in. State Museum, Lucknow, No. 56.394. This colossal figure hailing from Bhit? in the Allahabad district of the State of Uttar Pradesh was acquired for the State Museum, Lucknow in 1956. It is mentioned briefly, with one of its sides illustrated, in the Museum Reports (*). Iconographically this seems to be a piece hitherto unknown and, therefore calls for special attention. It is a free-standing figure carved all round, obviously intended to be placed at a cross? roads (catvara) so that it could be viewed from all sides. On one of its sides there is a crowned Yaksa in a protective attitude (fig. 1). His right hand is raised to the shoulder in abhayamudr? and the left hangs by his side holding a decorated jar, which can be seen at the back of the half-closed fist. He wears heavy earrings, necklace and bracelets. The upper garment is thrown gracefully over his shoulders. The folds of his dhoti which have been tied by a heavy girdle, are seen in front and on the left side. One end of the girdle can be observed over the right thigh. The figure, though muscular and heavy, is slightly thinner than the other at the back, which depicts another standing Yaksa. The second Yaksa on the other side, unlike the previous one, wears no crown. His hair, parted in the middle, falls on his shoulders in the form of braids. He wears neither neck? lace, nor ear-rings, nor any upper garment. The only ornament seen is a bracelet in his left hand. His right hand, which was raised to the shoulder possibly in an abhaya position is now broken, while in his left, which rests on his belly, he holds an indistinct object. His dhoti in this case too has been secured by a heavy girdle, the ends of which appear over the right thigh (fig. 2).

C1) Consolidated Report on the working of the State Museum, Lucknow, U.P. for the period from April 1, 1954 to March 31, 1960, p. 153, pi. II, fig. 31. 41</page><page sequence="2">On the left adjacent side of the crowned figure is seen a face, which is completely damaged. Only traces of the ears and ear-rings and a V-shaped heavy necklace are visible. Below this face is a figure of a boar standing on his hind legs on a high seat. His head is stretched up and the fore paws are joined together as if in salutation {namask?ramudr?) (fig. 3). At the back of this figure there is another completely damaged face. The angular por? tion below the chin suggests that it might have been a bearded face. No futher details of the face are available at present. Below it, but quite near to the base, is a prominent figure of a sejant lion (fig. 4). This fourfold Yaksa image from Bhita is interesting for the following reasons: (i) It has been carved on all the four faces. Among all the twenty-four Yaksa and Yaksint figures known up till now (2), and attributed to the Sunga or pre-Sunga periods, we know of only one i.e., the R?jgh?ta Yaksa now in the Bharat Kala Bhavan Museum at Varanasi, which has been carved on the three sides. The Bhit? figure is, therefore, unique of its type. (ii) The male figures on the obverse and reverse deserve special notice. One of them carry? ing a water vessel in his left hand, has a crown and several other ornaments; while the other, slightly bulkier than the first, has no ornaments, nor even an upper garment. His hair has been combed back from the middle and allowed to fall on the shoulders. These peculiar iconographic features seem to suggest some possible association with the figures of Visnu and Siva. (iii) The suggestion appears to be gaining further ground when the adjacent figures of a boar and a lion are taken into consideration. The association of a boar with a Yaksa (2) The following is the list of the twenty-four Yaksa and Yaksini figures: i. Manibhadra Yaksa from Parkham, Archaeological Museum, Mathura. ii. Bar od Yaksa, Archaeological Museum, Mathura. iii. Manas? Devi Yaksini, in situ at Jhing k? Nagal?, Mathura. iv. Bharatpur Gate Yaksa, Archaeological Museum, Mathura. v. Sopara (Bombay) Yaksa, National Museum, New Delhi. vi. Noh Yaksa, in situ at Noh near Bharatpur. vii. New Noh Yaksa. viii. Bir?vi Yaksa, Bharatpur Museum. ix. R?jgh?ta Yaksa, Bharat Kala Bhavan, Varanasi. x. Squatting Yaksa, Kaus?mbi, Allahabad Museum. xi. Palwal Yaksa, State Museum, Lucknow. xii. Patna Yaksa, Patna Museum. xiii.

A Yaksa figure, Prince of Wales Mu? seum, Bombay. 42</page><page sequence="3">has also been seen at Kaus?mbi (Allahabad Museum, No. 70), where the squatting Yaksa holds a boar by its hind legs. The above mentioned peculiarities tempt one to suspect that the present block of stone with images on each side should be regarded as an illustration of some earlier practice of depicting Visnu with his boar and lion forms along with Siva. No doubt before jumping to any such conclusion one must account for the standing position of the boar in natnask?ramu dr? and the bearded and unbearded faces on the two sides. 2 - Standing Siva on a linga (figs. 5, 6). From Mathur?; c. lst-2nd cent. A.D. Pennsylvania University Museum, Philadelphia. Dr Coomaraswamy has illustrated this male figure with the usual Kus?na headgear standing with his right hand raised in abhaya pose against a column-like object (3). The caption given by him below this illustration is ? Bodhisattva. Philadelphia ?, meaning thereby a figure of Bodhisattva now in Philadelphia. The object, as is evident from its stone, is a Mathur? piece of early Kus?na period and must have found its way to Phila? delphia before 1927, the year in which Coomaraswamy's History of Indian and Indonesian Art was published. Coomaraswamy's illustration created some doubts in my mind about its being a Bodhi? sattva figure. At my request and suggestion Caroline G?rden Dosker, the Assistant Regis? trar at Philadelphia very kindly had the sculpture re-examined and gave me two fine photo? graphs of the obverse and reverse sides. They are reproduced here (figs. 5, 6). The new photographs clearly show that the sculpture is not a Bodhisattva figure. For its correct identification the reverse is more useful than the obverse, which at once reveals that the so-called column is a big Sivalinga rounded at the top with clear demarcation of nut and the double heavy wreath running round the upper portion. The eight-petalled floral medallion, which is now highly water-worn, and has been so placed as to join the two coils of the wreath, is very interesting. Nut mark, wreath and the floral medallion are the com? mon characteristics of the known Kus?na Sivalingas from Mathur? (4). Thus the object is nothing but a linga. Now the male figure on the obverse gains much importance. Some of the early lingas have one or four human faces and are then named as Ekamukha- or Caturmukha-lingas respectively. What is noteworthy in this case is the com? plete representation of the deity in anthropomorphic form. We know of only two such instances, one from Guddimalam in South (5) and the other from Mathur? itself (6). The iconographic features of the present figure, as summarized below, are somewhat different from the above two: (3) A. K. Coomaraswamy, History of Indian and Indonesian Art, New York, 1927, fig. 80. (4) Compare Archaeological Museum, Mathura, No. 15.516; Lucknow Museum, Nos. B.141, H.l, H.2, etc. (5) COOMARASWAMY, Op. cit., fig. 66. &lt;6) Ibid., fig. 68. 43</page><page sequence="4">(i) The figure standing in samapada position has only two hands; the right one is in a typically Kus?na abhaya position, while the left resting near the thigh seems to hold a small jar. (ii) Siva wears a fluted headgear (usnlsa), ear-rings, triangular torque and bracelets. (iii) He is devoid of any of his known emblems such as the third eye, trident or the bull. (iv) The letters pu and ru are still visible from the single-lined inscription, which once ex? isted below the feet of the deity. They might have something to do with the words purusa, purari, etc. These features do not reveal any trace of foreign influence and are altogether different from those seen in the Siva figures from North-Western India and from Mathur? either on coins or in stone. Two figures carved on a corner pillar from Musanagar in Kanpur District to some extent bear comparison with the one under discussion These were discovered by me in 1970 and have been fully discussed elsewhere (fig. 7) (7). Both at Musanagar and Philadelphia the deity has two hands in the same position and has no trident or bull. He wears a fairly similar turban. In other aspects, of course, the Musanagar figures are more comprehensive and superior. The turbaned form of Siva (usriisin) is rare but not uncommon. We have it at Musa? nagar, Guddimalam and on some of the mukhalingas such as those hailing from Bhlt?, Bh?ratpur, Mathur? and Kaus?mbi. The third eye is usually absent. The representation of Siva's genital organ should also detain us for a while. In most of his figures attributed to the early period it is shown prominently in an erect position thereby signifying his eternal power of creation. But there are a few exceptions, such as the figure on one of the types of coins of Werna Kadphises and Siva on a Mathur? linga illustrated by Coomaraswamy (8). In the present case, on the basis of the photographs, I thought it was there too, but that possibility has been ruled out by Dosker's letter to me (9). Thus it is evident that this image of Siva is important because it is an early specimen of a period when the indigenous tradition of the country was active in evolving a formula for Siva icons, which portrayed him as a sober and well dressed god and not as a wild, naked and uncouth deity of the less civilized people from the hills. 3 - Hayagrtva (fig. 8). From Mathur?; c. 2nd-3rd cent. A.D.; 5.4 X 3 in. Bharat Kala Bhavan Museum, Varanasi, Acc. No. 4846. This figure hailing from Mathur? is now preserved in the Bharat Kala Bhavan Museum at Varanasi. It is perhaps unique in the entire known realm of Kus?na art at Mathur?. The piece is a small architectural fragment, which depicts in a pillared compartment the horse headed form of Visnu. The deity is four-handed and carries a gada (club) and cakra (wheel) (7) N. P. Joshi, ?A Unique Figure of Siva from Musanagar?, Bulletin of Museums and Archaeology in U.P., 3, 1969, pp. 25-30.

The normal right hand, which carries noth? ing, rests on the belly in a relaxed position. The normal left hand, folded inwards, holds an elongated object, the nature of which is not easy to ascertain. It may be the so-called water vessel, which is similarly held by some of the contemporary Visnu figures (10), or it may be the manuscript symbolizing the Vedas. The latter view fits in with the subsequent icon ographic canons which have been definitely followed in successive ages. The deity wears a short dhoti and sits almost cross-legged. The long object rolling on the deity's arms might be a vanam?l?. This feature is seen in some of the contemporary figures, though is not common (12). This figure of the horse-headed Visnu, that is Haya? griva ? horse-necked to be very precise ? is very well preserved and is definitely a new addition to our knowledge of Brahmanic iconography. The distinct head of the horse and appearance of club and wheel in the extra upper hands establish its identification as Haya grlva beyond doubt. The style of holding the weapons, the absence of halo, the form of the two pillars and the general delineation of the figure, help to attribute this piece to the Kus?na period, roughly c. 2nd-3rd cent. A.D. Early Mathur? art has already given us the figures of V?sudeva Krsna-Balar?ma-Ek? nams? (13) and Var?ha (14). A figure of Narasirhha or the Man-lion incarnation of roughly the same period has been brought to light by Mr Wahidulla Khan from Kondamottu, a place in South India (15). The present figure of Hayagriva from Mathur? is a fresh addition to the list of known figures of Vaisnava incarnations attributed to the pre-Gupta period. Hayagrlva's main achievement was to rescue the Vedas from the demons Madhu and Kaitabha and give them back to Brahm?. The myth is mentioned in detail in the S?nti parva of the Mah?bh?rata (16). Other Pur?nas such as Visnu, V?mana, Agni, Visnudharmottara, etc. refer to him (17). The Devlbhagavata and the Brahmakhanda of the Skanda-Pur?na give a different and more colourful version of the Hayagriva story (18). The Mah?bh?rata version tells us that Visnu assumed the form of Hayagriva at the request of Brahm? from whom the Vedas, his very eyes, were stolen by the two demons Madhu and Kaitabha. The horse-headed Visnu entered the ? under world ?, melodiously sung the S?ma hymns (or (10) N. P. Joshi, ? Pr?rambhika Visnum?rtiyon k? Eka Adhyayana ?

According to the Devi Bh?gavata version, Visnu's head was cut by chance and Tvast?, the divine architect and artisan, fixed the horse's head on his body under the instructions of goddess Durg?; and thus came forth Hayagriva who later on killed a demon of the same name. The Mah?bh?rata specifically tells us that Hayagriva was closely associated with the Vedas. The discovery of the Krama system of reciting the sacred hymns is to his credit. The style was further taught by him to one G?lava, a br?hmana of B?bhravya gotra and an inhabitant of the Panc?la country (the modern districts of Meeruth and Farukkhabad in the State of Uttar Pradesh). Hayagriva's association with this region has been further referred to by the V?mana Pur?na. It is therefore no surprise that the earliest image of this deity should hail from the Mathur? region not far from Panc?la and Kannauja, near which there was a place sacred to Hayagriva. 4 - Two Gold Repousse Figures (figs. 9, 10). State Museum, Lucknow, Surplus nos. 2377, 2378. The State Museum, Lucknow, is in possession of two female figures of very thin gold sheets raised in relief. Obviously they are interesting specimens of ancient repousse work. Till now they were lying in the cellars and the existing records have apparently nothing to tell about the date of their accession or provenance. Of the two small labels, which still happen to accompany these figures and bear Surplus Nos. 2377 and 2378, only the former one informs that the figure came from the site Motidih in the Shahjahanpur District of Uttar Pradesh. It has been described as a ? gold image of M?y? devi ?. In all probability both figures have come out as Treasure Trove Hoards and must have found their way to the Museum according to the procedure laid down in the Treasure Trove Act. These figures are interesting not only as antiquities of artistic and iconographic importance, but also as pieces of ancient ornaments. a) Surplus no. 2377; 5.5 X 3.5 cm. (fig. 9). This shows a female figure standing cross-legged with her right knee bent in a graceful pose. Her head is slightly turned and inclined to the right. She is arranging her ear-ring with her uplifted right hand. In her left hand, which hangs downwards, she holds the folded sash of her upper garment. She wears a dhoti in vikaccha style with innumerable tiny horizontal folds. These graceful folds giving the effect of a very light garment are one of the important characteristics of Gupta sculptures, and are also evident in some of the contemporary terracottas. The upper garment or ut tarty a runs round the back, partly covers her arms and then remains suspended at both sides. Compare the Gupta terracottas from R?jgh?ta, V?r?nasi: V. S. Agrawala, ? R?jagh?ta ke khilauno k? eka adhyayana ? (Hindi), N?gart Prach?rini Patrik?, V?r?nasI, Varsa 45, anka 3, K?rtika 1997, pp. 218-9. 46</page><page sequence="11">As befits her tender and slim body, the figure wears very light ornaments, viz. grooved ear-rings, single-beaded necklace (ek?vali), bead-bordered armlets and bangles. A beautiful forehead pendant (catula-tilaka-mani) decorates her forehead (19). Her broad girdle, consist? ing of three parallel rows of miniature plaques attached to a semicircular clasp, reminds one of the Kus?na girdles worn by the Mathur? Yaksl and a derivative of which survives even today. On her feet the figure wears very light anklets shaped like twisted ropes. Her hair has been arranged in tiers near the forehead and subsequently combed back. The facial features are not very charming. The delineation of the whole figure with an oblong border bearing a lotus-petal design is very fine and superior. The observation of the artist is very sharp, so much so, that the beautiful nipples of the breasts along with the4 round space encircling each of them have not escaped his eyes; and its representation in metal without having recourse to colour has been exquisitely done by him. Obviously there is nothing to show the divine nature of the figure. She cannot be taken as M?y?devi, as she was labelled before, because there is neither s?la tree behind her, nor is there any child issuing from her side. The figure, therefore, is to be interpreted merely as a decorative motif. It has been published by Dr Rai Govind Chandra (20), but the provenance given there is not correct. Dr Chandra mentions it as Pipr?w?, but Pipr?w? gold plaque is quite a different object, as already shown by Peppe and Smith (21). The Pi? pr?w? figure has been attributed to the Mauryan age, while the present one should be placed in about 5th to 6th cent. A.D. b) Surplus no. 2378; 8.5 X 4.5 cm. (fig. 10). The label found with this figure describes it as ? a gold image of a goddess broken in two pieces ?. No provenance has been mentioned. This figure has a similar lotus-petal border but with a slight change in pattern. The petals are more natural in shape. The lady stands facing with her knees slightly bent. The ornaments and the lower garment are very similar to the one just described, the pose of the suspended left hand is also the same, but the upraised right hand in this case holds a long-stalked full-blown lotus of which only a few petals are now surviving. The hair, deco? rated with a looped bead string on the right side, has been arranged in a series of parallel tiers near the forehead and above that has been fashioned much like the famous Gupta style described as jat?j?ta-sadrsa-kesabandha (22). Apart from the hair style, broad face, full cheeks, long and curved eyebrows, thick lips with depressions at the ends (srkkini), every? thing goes to indicate the full-fledged and refined style of the Gupta period. What is most interesting in the whole composition is the miniature Yaksa figure stand? ing near the right feet of the female figure. His broad face, bulging eyes, wide-open mouth, (20) Rai Govindchandra, Studies in the Devel? opment of Ornaments and Jewellery in Proto Historic India, Varanasi, 1964, pi. XLVIII, p. 342. (21) W. C. Peppe, V. A. Smith, ? The Pipr?wa St?pa containing Relics of the Buddha?, JRAS, 1898, p. 574. (22) Agrawala, ?R?jagh?ta...?, cit., p. 221. 47</page><page sequence="12">pot belly and short legs are very obviously Yaksa characteristics. On no account can he be taken to be a mere boy, standing by the side of his mother. The presence of this Yaksa and the long-stalked lotus carried by the female figure give her divine status. The associa? tion of a pot-bellied Yaksa with Laksmi carrying a lotus is well testified to by the different seals and sealings unearthed from Bas?rh, Bhit?, Ahicchatr?, etc. (23). Most of the fig? ures seen on these sealings are of Laksmi being anointed by the two elephants, but in one instance from Bas?rh bearing the legend Yuvar?ja-p?dtya-Kum?ram?ty?dhikaranasya, we find the Laksmi figure alone standing with a long-stalked lotus in her upraised right hand flanked by a Yaksa on each side pouring coins from a jar (23). This is much akin to our gold figure, with the difference that we have only one Yaksa standing with upraised right hand devoid of any jar. All this leads us to propose the identification of the present figure as that of Laksmi holding a lotus {padmahast? Laksmi). The oblong frame with lotus-petal border running round the entire figure adds further weight to this identification. These two figures are thus interesting for their iconography and art, but their antiqua? rian value as decorative objects of precious metal is very important. Their miniature size and the presence of two holes in the Laksmi figure, obviously for passing a string or in? serting a hook-like object, suggest that the pieces might have been in use as ornaments. The use of human figures as ornamental motifs was known since very early times. The following are a few instances: (i) Male figure with upraised hands in the necklace of a Yaksa from Pitalkhor? (25). (ii) Seated human figures in the girdle pendants of a Kus?na Yakst in the Bharat Kala Bhavan, Varanasi (26). (iii) Two-handed human figure on Garuda decorating the armlets of a seated Bodhisattva in the Mathura Museum (27). (iv) Hovering human figures in the necklace of a Gandh?ra Bodhisattva in the Allahabad Museum (28). (v) Plaques depicting horse-riders and Yaksas with coiled tails forming the girdle of the portrait-figure of Castana in the Mathura Museum (29). (vi) S?rya on the forehead pendant of a Kus?na female figure in the State Museum, Lucknow (30). (23) Rai Govindachandra, Pr?cina Bh?rata me Laksmi pratim? (Hindi), V?r?nasi, 1964, pp. 86, 87, 127.
