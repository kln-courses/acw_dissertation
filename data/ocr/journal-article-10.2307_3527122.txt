<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews Jimenez, who has a very distinctive painting style but has also remained unmarried and is thus the primary figure in the family business. Income generated from ceramics, a predominantly female craft, is in general much lower. Chibnik takes issue with Lois Wasser- spring, author of Oaxacan Ceramics, Traditional Folk Art by Oaxacan Women (Chronicle Books, 2000), who argues that the domestic and female associations of the craft have kept the prices low. He proposes that the friability of the medium inevitably makes it less attractive as a tourist purchase in a highly competitive market and concludes that it is 'unlikely that gender accounts for much of the discrepancy between the prices of ceramics and wood carvings' (p. 122). Wasserspring recounts the way that women's work was sometimes subsumed under male names and puts much more emphasis on the patriarchal ideologies that are still so strong in Mexican culture, where the gendered division of labour works against women, who have less access to education and work oppor- tunities. Even Chibnik concedes that women in general are in a less favourable position to negotiate high prices. While in general Chibnik's approach to the dis- course around wood carving is sympathetic but scep- tical, his occasional use of the term 'genius' seems surprisingly unreconstructed. Using the term as a fact rather than a construct, he writes that 'only a widely recognised genius such as Manuel Jimenez can con- sistently get away with temperamental behaviour' (p. 152). Chibnik himself notes that most of the artisans see their occupation as a good way of earning money rather than a higher calling to 'art'; however, the mystique of 'art' values and popular notions of originality and genius inflect much of the popular discourse. The significance of this book lies in its closely observed contacts over a key period of years in the development of a new art form. Chibnik approaches his subjects with a refreshingly open mind, avoiding a dogmatic, doctrinaire or romantic framework, and recognizing the economic benefits that wood carving has brought to previously poor communities. He finds relatively few family conflicts arising from individual work preferences or educational aspira- tions. In some families, wood carving can be an incentive for children to leave school, but it can equally provide the funding for children to stay on in education. It can allow people to resist the pull of migration or it can provide the funds to allow people to migrate. Chibnik examines the fissure between the history of this craft and its representation or mis-represen- tation by everyone from the makers themselves through to the middlemen, gallery owners and deal- ers. But that is hardly the full story. Chibnik's detailed study leads the reader through encounters with many individual players, examining personal histories and motives, and offering an infinitely more subtle ana- lysis of the situation. Ultimately he reaches a bleak conclusion, and expresses his fears that the bubble may burst and the market will suddenly disappear. That wood carving is dependent on the vagaries of fashion and the taste of a dominant culture (the USA) is indisputable, yet craft skills are providing expanding opportunities. Confidence acquired in one context may be applied to another. In spite of an element of 'intercultural miscommunication' (p. 247), wood carving will surely keep changing and responding to new stimuli. Emerging new crafts in the developing world are much misunderstood phenomena. Michael Chibnik's careful documentation and wide frame- work of investigation brings a welcome and wise contribution to the debate.

Animation historian William Moritz has suggested that 'no animation film that is not non-objective and/ or non-linear can really qualify as true animation'.1 His perspective here is informed by the view that much else can be achieved just as well through live action, and that the American cartoonal tradition is an exaggerated re-run of silent comedy's vocabulary of 'gags'. His more important, if implied, insight remains that non-objective animation has remained systematically sidelined in much animation literature, leading him to note that Cecille Starr and Robert Russett's Experimental Animation (Da Capo, 1988) 'may be the only survey book that is really about 302</page><page sequence="2">Reviews animators and animation' (ibid., p. 24). My own work has always tried to resist such a view and to draw all forms of animation into the same critical remit, in an attempt to embrace the similarity and confluence between forms and approaches.2 This, of course, has been a profoundly difficult task, for as Liz Faber and Helen Walters acknowledge in Animation Unlimited, animation may be found 'occupying a space between film-making, art and graphic design' (p. 6), and this both dilutes its profile and amplifies its presence. Faber and Walters' work, then, is a welcome addition to animation literature because it updates Starr and Russett's focus on more experimental films, while presenting (and richly illustrating) animation's impact and effect in a wider visual culture. Structured around the four basic premises of form, sound, words and character, the book privileges an auteurist approach, giving a brief career overview of some key film-makers, with attention to the nature of their innovatory contribution, and images drawn from significant films. The book also includes a DVD of selected films-a valuable resource for readers familiar with, but unable to see, such work. While lacking a fully developed analytical context, the approach does promote the core values and principles of film-makers dedicated to creating animation-understood through a variety of definitions and styles-as an art form. This focus in itself responds to Faber and Walters' concern that animation, ironically, 'seems to suffer from its own limitless potential' (p. 7). The book is a timely imposition, too, at a moment when the very 'democracy' of the form as it has been embraced through new, domestically-available tech- nologies of creation and distribution has provoked a crisis of 'quality'. Veteran animator Paul Driessen notes, 'anyone can do it but they're not good film- makers' (p. 7). Those represented here clearly are the state of the art, and speak to a variety of traditions in animation which act as a guarantor for innovation, integrity and progress. Perhaps, much to John Kricfalusi's possible chagrin, there is not a fart gag in sight, but there is a great deal else. Particularly engaging is the recognition of the impact of artists working in 'new' media who have not been entirely seduced by the PIXAR aesthetic in films such as Finding Nemo (2003). Acknowledging the pioneering importance ofJohn Stehura in Cyber- metik 53 (1960-65); Ed Emshwiller, who worked with Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith, later founders of PIXAR; the 'organic' works of Karl Sims; the 'intelligent art' of Yoichiro Kawaguchi, and the 'digital harmony' in the John Whitney Snr-influ- enced Larry Cuba films, the book also foregrounds a new generation who learned on a personal com- puter-the 'anti-anime' of Tomioka Satoshi; the 'anti-gaming' of Johnny Hardstaff, and the garish grotesques of Run Wrake. This sits alongside recog- nition for artists working on the Web, such as Insertsilence, Han Hoogerbrugge and Lev Yilmaz, and as such, illustrates how technological change has once more been absorbed into the myriad approaches to animation as art. As PIXAR's leading light John Lasseter has always insisted, the computer is just another tool, and while instrumental in creating a dominant aesthetic in feature animation, it is, never- theless, merely another 'pencil' in the hands of those aspiring to make more personal work. Faber and Walters recognize that such work does sit within a wider tradition-one which includes, for example, Stan Brakhage, whose insight into such film-making, that it intrinsically engages with 'the concept of vision and the act of perception', remains true. Further, these works seem inherently to express acts of consciousness (memory, fantasy, dream, inner states of being, the unconscious, the subconscious); but, perhaps most importantly, as British animator Stuart Hilton has noted, they exist as works 'using only processes peculiar to the medium'. This recog- nition of the fundamental and unique vocabulary of animation is essentially the common aspect which unifies all the artists in the book; it is readily allied with Russian artist, actor and musician Fedor Khitruk's observation that 'animation collects all these professions together' (p. 154). It is this, for me anyway, which remains the most significant aspect of Faber and Walters' work. While Czech surrealist Jan Svankmajer may insist that 'poetry is the foundation of all forms of art' (p. 7), I would suggest that it is the interrogation of the 'forms' of art which is the foundation of 'poetry', and it is animation's capacity to work as a cross-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary 'form' which is at the core of the 'art' so self-evident in this book. This very perspective, which is highly inclusive, can sit uneasily with artists who do not wish to be pigeon-holed, even in the widest of possible generic niches. It is their very individuality which informs 303</page><page sequence="3">Reviews their working identity, and which resists parameters, boundaries and definitions both within and outside the work. On the one hand, this preserves distinction and specificity; one the other, it is an unhelpful denial of the pertinence and quality of the form itself, in the face of the ways it is still marginalized as children's entertainment and schedule filler. Though this is an old argument, and there is some currency in the view that as a mainstream vehicle animation enjoys both commercial and critical success, it still suffers from its lack of recognition as 'art' unless it is couched as an 'avant-garde' form. Faber and Walters offer some degree of a corrective for this by integrating figures such as George Griffin, Paul Driessen, Mark Baker and John Lasseter, who all criticize, revise and re- determine the traditional 'cartoon'-all, in some way, respecting and admiring aspects of Disney, Chuck Jones and Tex Avery, but ultimately taking the cartoon into a different realm by enhancing still further the self-reflexive aspects of all animated films. There is also a strong British presence in the selection, represented mainly by a vanguard of male animators self-consciously working with varying types of abstraction, from Stuart Hilton's non-narra- tive, anti-anthropomorphic, Robert Breer-like col- lages, to Philip Hunt's interpretation of William Burroughs' stream of consciousness prose, to Paul Bush's scratched adaptation of Coleridge's 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', and Tim Hope's ebullient The Wolfman (1999). At one level, these are all works playing with 'language' per se, engaging with ideas about adaptation, transformation, transi- tion and revision, and thus, once more, working through approaches to 'metamorphosis', animation's most distinctive trope. Though it would be churlish to question a selection of this kind for whom it includes and omits, it is the one disappointment of the book that it does not include more women, especially as during the 1970s and 1980s North American women animators, and in the 1990s British women animators-albeit through more observa- tionalist and comic means-effectively re-invented the animation aesthetic, and provided a platform for later progressive works. While Caroline Leaf, Erica Russell and Suzie Templeton are present here, recognition for Suzan Pitt, Sally Cruickshank, Vera Neubauer, Marjut Rimmenen and Ruth Lingford would have been especially welcome, as all have tested the 'unlimited' parameters of animation aesthe- tically, ideologically and graphically. This is but a small point, however, as the inclusion of Suzie Templeton, so early in her career, only signals the future potential of the form. Rarely has such a bleak, emotive, utterly affecting piece of work-Dog (2001)-been achieved in stop motion puppet ani- mation, and this in a field where O'Brien, Harryhau- sen, Selick, Kawamoto and Purves have created extraordinary, enduring work. Jean Philippe Deslandes of the PLEIX graphic design collective has ruefully observed, however, that 'It is a pity that most animation films have such a short life' (p. 88), and while this may be true, Faber and Walters' book nevertheless promotes, encourages and evidences innovative short film, insisting upon its longevity and influential significance. From pioneers such as Lye, Bute, Fischinger and McLaren, to masters such as Norstein, Driessen, Trnka and Svank- majer, to contemporary visionaries such as the Quay twins, Hope and Dudok de Wit, the book provides stimulating coverage of a diverse and complex field. Further benefit may have come from directing readers to other literature, though pertinent websites are cited throughout. There may be a final contra- diction, then, that while recognizing Russian anima- tor Nina Shorina's view that 'There on the periphery of cinema, it was easier to breath and create' (p. 164), such a book further consolidates the view that animation remains the most consistently experimental form as it extends its popularity and extensive pre- sence in mainstream visual culture. Animation Unlim- ited proves animation's radicalism, subversiveness and modernity, yet it also, by default, demonstrates that much of the innovation in animation has not received the recognition it deserves. This book demonstrates an ongoing problem, then, but it is also part of the solution. Professor Paul Wells University of Teesside Notes 1 W.
