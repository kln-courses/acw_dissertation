<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sha'ar Hagolan 1: Neolithic Art In Context By Yosef Garfinkel and Michele A. Miller, with contributions by Susan E. Allen, Nira Alperson, Nachum Applbaum, Yaakov H. Applbaum, David Ben-Shlomo, Ana Cohen-Weinberger, Anna Eirikh- Rose, Brian Hesse, Sonya Itkis, Naomi Korn, Zinovi Matskevich, Daphna Zuckerman. Oxford: Oxbow Books, 2002. Pp. x + 262. Hardback, $85.00. ISBN 1-84217-057-0. arfinkel and Miller's new volume is an important contribution to the sparse literature on the Levantine Pottery Neolithic. The data and interpretations published here not only offer considerable new information about Yarmukian chronology, material culture and subsistence but also force a reconsideration of longstanding beliefs about the organization and complexity of the Pottery Neolithic. Sha ar Hagolan is a large Pottery Neolithic site in the Jordan Valley of Israel. The type-site for the regional Yarmukian culture of the sixth millennium BCE, it was discovered in the 1930s by local kibbutz members and excavated by Prof. Moshe Stekelis from 1949 to 1952. Excavations were renewed at the site in 1989 under the direction of Yosef Garfinkel; Michele Miller became co-director in 1998. Sha'ar Hagolan 1 presents the results of research done between 1989 and 1999, during which time archaeologists uncovered over 1800 square meters of the site. Discoveries include numerous structures and courtyards as well as flint artifacts, pottery, groundstone objects, clay rods and whorls, faunal and floral remains, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, engraved pebbles, and exotic trade goods.

Part I includes chapters summarizing the survey and excavation work done at Sha'ar Hagolan as well as chapters describing the site's architecture and layout. Intensive surface survey delimited the horizontal extent of Yarmukian Sha'ar Hagolan: it covered more than twenty hectares, within which patches of more and less intense occupation were identified on the basis of artifactual and architectural densities. A Middle Bronze Age I (late third millennium BCE) component was explored as well and found to cover about 16 hectares, and scattered sherds from various historic periods were also retrieved. Modern cultivation complicates surface survey at the site, and the site boundaries may be expanded in the future. A magnetic survey of the site was also conducted (Itkis), which revealed several large anomalies in as yet unexcavated areas. Multiple massive building complexes separated by planned streets have been discovered at Sha'ar Hagolan. These complexes, which Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo call courtyard houses, consist of several enclosed rooms surrounding open courtyards. Two large complexes (ca. 230 square meters and more than 800 square meters) have completely been excavated so far, and a third has been partly uncovered. Walls are of river pebbles and mudbrick, and some areas were paved with flat river pebbles. Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo believe that courtyards were the primary activity areas in courtyard houses; paved rooms were used for storage and unpaved rooms for general living. The spatial sophistication of the houses and the evidence for deliberate village planning testify to complex social organization at both the family and community levels. Many archaeologists will quail at the idea that Sha'ar Hagolan's formalized streets are evidence for an "urban concept," but the site's architecture does indicate a high degree of social complexity in the Yarmukian. Part II presents analyses of the site's ceramic and lithic assemblages and offers numerous artifact illustrations. Eirikh- Rose and Garfinkel's chapter on the large pottery assemblage characterizes the wares and manufacturing techniques used at Sha'ar Hagolan, offers typological summaries of the assemblage by form and by decoration, and compares it to assemblages from other Yarmukian sites. A brief discussion of vessel function is based on a division of the vessels into four overarching categories: storage, food processing, serving and valuable materials preparation. Cohen-Weinberger's petrographic analysis revealed that most vessels were locally made, and that there was no correlation between vessel type and raw materials used. Zuckerman reenacted Yarmukian pottery production in an experimental workshop conducted at the site. A chapter detailing Sha'ar Hagolan's sizable lithic assemblage (Alperson and Garfinkel) focuses on the flint artifacts, although the existence of small numbers of limestone and obsidian artifacts is noted. Technological aspects of the flint assemblage are described (raw material acquisition strategies and knapping practices and locations), and its typological breakdown is presented. The spatial distribution of lithics is discussed only briefly, and with the caveat that additional analysis is needed. A supplementary chapter on refitted flints (Matskevich) notes that in each of the three cases studied the knapper used a similar simple procedure. Finally, a short chapter on the typology and functions of basalt and limestone tools (Garfinkel) concludes Part II. Part III consists of chapters discussing the site's renowned collection of prehistoric art objects. Sha'ar Hagolan's figurine assemblage is the largest such collection from any single site in Israel, and the largest sixth millennium BCE assemblage from anywhere in the Levant. The ongoing research at Sha'ar Hagolan has both recontextualized figurines found during previous work at the site, and expanded the site's art assemblage considerably (Garfinkel, Korn and Miller). Symbolically-expressive finds include a clay statue, several different types of clay anthropomorphic figurines, anthropomorphic pebble figurines, zoomorphic figurines, seals, and geometrically engraved basalt pebbles. The clay statue and the anthropomorphic figurines are discussed in detail: accounts of their manufacture and stylistic attributes are provided along with descriptions of selected figurines. The rest of the art assemblage is largely ignored. Miller explores the social contexts of the anthropomorphic figurines' manufacture and use and compares and contrasts the different implications of the clay figurines, the pebble figurines, and the clay statue for broader cultural issues such as labor organization. Her discussion of the figurines' symbolic meanings is strong in its insistence on considering the figurines within the broader Yarmukian cultural context and in its recognition that symbols may have multiple meanings. Part III also includes a study of the spatial distribution of figurines within the site (Ben-Shlomo and Garfinkel) and a computed tomography-based analysis of the techniques used to produce figurines (Applbaum and Applbaum). The fourth, and smallest, section of the volume consists of two chapters offering preliminary analyses of the site's paleoethnobotanical (Allen) and zooarchaeological (Hesse) assemblages. The macrobotanical data presented include only fifteen percent of the total assemblage, but, given the scarcity of published analyses of Yarmukian botanical assemblages, even a limited report is welcome. Allen's is particularly so, as it includes detailed accounts of the recovery and analytic methods used with the assemblage. Also gladly received is Hesse's report on the Sha'ar Hagolan faunal assemblage, as there are few published analyses of Yarmukian faunal collections. The inhabitants of Sha'ar Hagolan relied primarily on cereal agriculture, although they grew pulses and gathered wild plants as well. They also herded sheep, goats, and pigs; with 234 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 67:4 (2004)</page><page sequence="3">the possible exception of cattle, whose domestication status remains unresolved, few wild animals were hunted. There is no evidence for differential distribution of meat at the site. Garfinkel concludes the volume with a chapter summarizing the important discoveries made at Sha) ar Hagolan and attributing the site's social and technological complexity to scalar stress. Five more excavation seasons were planned for Sha'ar Hagolan: this volume is not a final report. For their prompt publication of important research data Garfinkel, Miller, and their associates should be commended. The data presented may not be comprehensive, but they provide significant new information about an as yet poorly understood era and culture. Sha'ar Hagolan 1 is a welcome addition to the Near Eastern Neolithic corpus. Katheryn C. Twiss State University of New York at Stony Brook</page></plain_text>
