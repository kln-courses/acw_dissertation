Some rooms were set in a line with the colonnade on the sides of the exedra. Two rooms were on the northeast side, and their mosaic pave- ments had been torn away. Trials executed beneath the level of the pavements of the latest building existing on this place revealed remains of the mosaics belonging to an I _~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~OI Fig. 2.

These mosaics were left in situ and covered again when the exploration had to be suspended at the closing of the campaign.' The whole figured panel of the mosaic belonging to the room next to the exedra was brought to light during these works, and only a part of its border remained con- cealed under the walls of the later structure (Fig. 2). The emblemna (Fig. 3) was in fact flanked by two panels with diaper-pattern; beneath these three panels, and proba- bly above them as well, was a series of five small geometric panels, two square ones between three rectangular ones, containing circles, rhombs, and dotted crosses. 1 Antioch-on-the-Orontes, III (Princeton, 1941), pp. 11 f., fig. 10; Plan IV on p. 257; pp. 176 f., nos. 110-111, pls. 50-51.</page><page sequence="3">AION 271 Beyond a narrow cornice of small light diamonds on dark background, a second border, consisting of circles containing curvilinear rhombs with white squares in the center alternated with dotted crosses, reached the edge of the pavement. On stylistic grounds together with the character of this geometric decoration we assign the mosaic roughly to the middle of the third century after Christ. Fig. 3. The Emblenma of the Mosaic of Aion and the Chronoi In the ernblemac four men are sitting at table, three forming a close group on the right, the fourth apart from the others on the left. The kline on the right seems to Co'me to an end beyond the third figure, where a vertical line of red squares shows apparently the border of the reddish blanket falling from the solid corner of the couch downwards, in the same way as a similar horizontal line shows the lower hem of the stuff. At the same solid corner begins also one of the three series of folds, represented by concentric arched strokes, which depict the falling of the stuff on the front of the kline. Ordinarily, indeed, one couch would not hold more than three guests. Along the f ront-edge of the top of the kline a padded ring, in a darker red and with black shadows, has replaced, as was often the case, the single pulvinii. The bodies of the guests are partly concealed because of this ring~ and because of the evident inclination</page><page sequence="4">272 DORO LEVI of the couch-according to the older fashion-away from the table.2 The two first figures on the right appear almost in a sitting position, the third evidently has his legs stretched on the couch, holding howTever his torso erect like his companions. The man on the right corner is adult, bearded, and wrapped up in a violet-gray mantle which covers most of his arms. A broad white-yellowish fillet adorning his forehead holds tightly to his temples some tufts of leaves and blades of grass, while a garland of yellow, red, and brown flowers encircles his neck. The left forearm rests horizontally on the couch, and the fingers hold a banquet-wreath. The elbow of the right arm rests on the couch, and the hand holds the bottom of a cup full of wine. The man's head is slightly tilted toward the left, and his eyes gaze downwards with a melancholy expression. The second figure is a young man with energetic features, whose black hair is adorned with a rich wreath of slender sprigs. His head is bending slightly to the right as he gazes intently forward. lie wears a white-gray tunic with thin red clavi and with a red border on the neck. His left arm rests on the couch just as that of his fellow, but with his hand concealed under the garment; his right arm, on the contrary, is bare to the elbow and is stretched obliquely across the couch and its padded ring. The third figure is a robust adolescent, showing his body in full nudity except for the left shoulder and arm, around which a greenish-gray cloth is wrapped. The black hair is kept tight on the forehead by a red-pinkish fillet, and falls in waving curls on the nape of the neck. The youth gazes boldly, almost enquiringly before him, his head being slightly turned toward the man on his left. His left hand plays with another banquet-wreath which he presses between his open fingers, his right arm is stretched sidewards, and the hand holds a cup on the palm. Of the fourth -figure, unfortunately, only the head with a part of a shoulder is preserved: the rest of his body and the remainder of the representation were destroyed in antiquity, and have been then re- placed by slabs of limestone and marble. The face depicts a man of advanced age, with grayish moustache and flowing beard. The thick curls of hair are adorned here too by a luxuriant garland of leaves and blades of grass. His look is directed to the other figures. Beneath his reddish shoulder the remains of a cushion are visible, where the man evidently rested the elbow of his left arm. On the left upper corner of the panel the man's hand holds an arched object which we shall discuss below. An object with a three-legged base stands on the ground before the central of the three figures on the right. Its body shows vertical grooves, expanding toward the three feet of the base and proving it a metal object. The top is a round plane adorned with an egg or tongue pattern on the edge and with two rings falling from it. It is undoubtedly an incense-burner (OvHca-rnptov, or EOrXaptov)3 of a shape used in Hellenistic and Roman times, and well known to us both through a large number of representations 2 See J. Marquardt and A. AMau, Das Privatleben der R&amp;mvier (in Marquardt and Mommsen, Handb. der rom.

Two original specimens,6 probably from Egypt, have preserved to us even their calotte-shaped lids, decorated with open-work or with delicate reliefs. One of them shows in the center of the top a strongly projecting ring around which the lid rested, and thus explains the black circular mark on our mosaic. The same ring, only narrower and hig-her, appears also on the incense-burner represented on a coin from Smyrne,7 the age of which is better determined than that of the afore- mentioned monuments because it is certainly later than A.D. 190; in this, flames are rising from the mouth of the basin of the incense-burner, produced by the burning incense. The shape of the stand shows a very common variation, according to which both the base and the top flair out from a narrow central part. The three feet do not reveal clearly the usual shape of horse-hoofs or lion-paws. A ring decorates the narrowest part of the stand, and two rings hang from the edge of the top as in our mosaic. The same variety of incense-burner appears, especially, in the painting of the Aldobrandini Wedding, where the central ring has an egg or bead decoration, and a similar decoration appears along the edge of the top, as in our mosaic. In the painting not two rings but two little chains hang from the edge; on each side, to be precise, two vertical elements of the chains, ending with small beads at the bottom, are connected in the middle by a curved element. Here a woman brings to the basin of the tripod an object which has given rise to several hypotheses, but which is not yet definitely explained.8 It cannot be the lid, because it is smaller than the basin of the incense-burner. It has been interpreted as a cup. It is held, however, obliquely by the woman, in a strange way, as if she had already poured its content of incense. But it might be, on the contrary, a cake of incense itself; and indeed, the figure on our mosaic, with the fingers of the hand protruding beyond the border of the couLch, seems to push and to arrange within the mouth of the incense-burner a whitish mass with a round outline, which might well be a similar cake of incense.

We have, consequently, in this mosaic of Antioch a unique case in which we find not only a series of personifications, but also a kind of title helping us to grasp the general meaning of the allegory; undoubtedly the three figures seated on the same couch are included in the comprehensive conception of the " Chronoi." Aion (Aevum, Saeculum) is time in an absolute sense, in opposition to Chronos, that is, time in relation to something, and especially to human life.9 The epigram attributed to Plato, which we have quoted at the beginning of this paper, well expresses the difference between the two: " Aion brings everything; the long Time knows how to change name and shape and nature and fate as well." In a passage of the Timnaeus (37 D) Plato outlines also the philosophical definition of Aion, which will long have currency-although not obtaining a universal acceptance-as the conception of ideal eternity, in contrast with Chronos, empirical time. Even before Plato, however, Greek philosophy in its earliest stages was speculating about the concept of time. We can trace these speculations from Pherekydes of Samos, and they were bound of course to rise to the first rank of importance in the thought of the Pythagoreans. The per- sonification of the conception would also occur naturally in the images of poetry, as is examplified in numerous passages: for example, time is " a benevolent god " (Ev3- /ap-qs OEos) for Sophocles (El. 179). In much later times, Chronos is considered as a divine being, a 8a1v1kw ruling over human destinies, in the interesting epigram which alludes to the battle of Chaironeia: 'D, XpoVE, irav-o-ovOVq7-0g IvaVEMTLO-K7TOE8at aa4ov.... From very old times the personification of Chronos enters into Hellenic mythology and cosmogony as well, because of the equation of Chronos with Kronos. Genealogies and assimilations are multiplied hereafter because, from the speculations of the Pythagoreans, Chronos enters as a cosmic principle into the Orphic doctrine, partici- pates in the mysteries, is invoked in magic formulas together with the other primordial principles and with the other abstractions with which it is related. According to the Orphics, in fact, Chronos, identified with Herakles, husband to 'Ava6YK7 or to 'A8pdo- ErLaa, " Time that does not grow old," is imagined in the shape of a snake with the For recent and comprehensive bibliographies on Aion see: Wernicke in Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopddie, s. v.

It has usually a leonine head and a human body encircled by a serpent's coils, on its shoulders are four wings adorned with the symbols of the four seasons, and it holds two keys in its hands.'2 We shall see, however, that not at all to be rejected is the old theorv of Zoega according to which this would be the divine being called, in the sacred books of the mysteries, Aion: Aht)wJ ITOLKLXOAOf4O01 E'XCw KX-qZt&amp;a yEvE'OXftg, as he is described by Nonnus.'3 Aion is called the son of Zeus as early as Euripides (Heraclid., 899 f.), and is named in association with the Mo'tpa TEXEo-o-&amp;t8cEtpa, the " Destiny which pro- cures the fulfilment." In much later times the name appears in the proem to the Orphic Hymns, known by the title of EV?X7 lTpos Movo-aZtov (line 28). In a gold lamina pub- lished by Father Secchi '4 he is identified with Sarapis and invoked with the words AhGwV EpITEra KVpLE ctapaT7t: because of this appellative it would seem that with the name Aion was invoked an image of Sarapis with its body encircled by serpents, or a divine symbol in the shape of a serpent. This assimilation of Aion to Sarapis, the god of the dead, explains his association in a cult of Alexandria with a female divinity whom the Greeks called Kore. It was a nocturnal rite, described by St. Epiphanius (Panarion, LI, 22, 9 f.; ed. Holl, Il, Ieipzig, 1922, p. 285), which was performed in Kore's sanctuary by carrying in procession an imnage of Aion by the light of torches and to the sound of flutes and tambourines, to celebrate his birth from Kore, that is, from " the Virgin," considered here as the mother and not, as in the Hellenic myth, the bride of the god of Hades. Aion was represented in his wooden idol as seated, naked, with a gold cross on his forehead, two similar crosses on his hands and two on his knees.'5 In the Alexander legend of Pseudo-Callisthenes (about A.D. 300) there is reference probably to the same idol in the " indescribable xoanon " repre- senting Sarapis-Aion, or Aion Plutonius, identified also with Agathos Daemon, who is called the patron deity of Alexandria. In this passage a colossal image of Kore is 12 G. Zoega, Bassorilievi antichi di Romta, II (Rome, 1808), pp. 32 ff., pl. LIX; F.

These are indeed, in all probability, the two divinities represented on a relief from Rome or the Roman Campagna (Fig. 6), dating from the second or third century after Christ, and which from the Primoli Collection passed into the possession of Franz Cumont. Both divinities unfortunately are headless. Aion, with a bare torso and a kilt around his waist, had certainly the klaft on his head, the ankhl in his right hand, and a two-headed serpent winding around his legs and looping its two heads over his shoulders.'7 Elsewhere our god is identified with Osiris and Adonis." The identification with the Sun appears also directly, beside its being implicit in Aion's identification with Agathos Daemon, which is but another name often applied in magic papyri to the Sun-God: 1 so, for instance, in the great magic papyrus of Paris there is an invocation to him identified with Ra: e "' 'Xw &amp;a- r, e A\ " ,, r o rcov oXov 8 E0roTT% 6 A0.w rv tJv A I vcto-v El 6 KOa-1.OKpaTwp, 'Pa, llv.20 In the same way he is identified with the Sun in one of the hymns attributed to the Cretan poet of the Antonine period, Mesomedes: 8V' co Xau,urpaZg aLKr^TLt yatav rrao-av 7rTvp0EvXv Atcwv ao-,8E/rrwv fXoy,uC1v.` Fig. 6.

To him was even dedicated a feast-day, known to be the 5th of January (Ioh. Lydus, De mnens., IV, 1)."23 The mythological and cosmogonic elabora- tions around the divinized concept of Aion were bound in fact to receive a powerful stimulus when the peculiar Abraxas religion was founded in Alexandria, in the second century after Christ, by the genial Basileides. Here a deep Brahminical inspiration was combined with pagan, Egyptian, Mithriac elements, and with creeds of the young Christian religion. But in the last religious cycle where the conception of Aion found its widest diffusion, in Gnosticism, we find it also deprived of all its former mytho- logical and philosophical content: the Gnostics have created a special doctrine and an elaborate nomenclature of the Aiones, who have multiplied by now and fill the world like categories of demons, but are reduced to mere conceptions of species, both tem- poral and spatial.24 Alongside of these mythological and cosmogonic divagations, however, philoso- phy was evolving independently its own speculation on the concept of time, or rather, since Aristotle, was trying to dise1ntangle the rational element from the religious in- volvements, and was addres-sing the thought to new, daring considerations: "As a matter of fact, this word ' duration ' possessed a divine significance for the ancients, for the fulfilment which includes the period of life of any creature outside of which no natural development can fall, has been called its duration. On the same principle the fulfilment of the whole heaven, the fulfilment which includes all time and infinity, is 'duration '-a name based upon the fact that it is always-duration immortal and divine." 25 During the first centuries of our era the investigations on the time con- town passed from Roman hands; later the temple became a church dedicated to St. Archelaus. One among the many invocations (proskytveniata) inscribed on the pronaos and on the porticoes around the temple's cella is especially interesting, and has been thoroughly studied by Nock in his work quoted above. It was written by a worshipper who urges the god to make manifest to him whether he is the Sun-God. Among the invocations to the god, we read: aKrWo/3o'0A 8&amp;JwoTrc, Mav8oDx, TtTarv, MaKapdv . . .; and finally: 6vGa ac Eyvmov, Mav8ou)t, 'qXtov rov 7rarVEvo7rT71v 8aE07tOT7V, LraLvrYo /3acrtXfcL, Ahwva 7raTvroKparopa. Again the identification with the Sun-God appears in the last words of the text: "0 happy folk, that dwell in the city beloved by the Sun Mandulis, even holy Talmis, which is under the sceptre of fair-tressed Isis of the countless names." 23 The false etymology suggested in this passage, that is AWv = lanus, may have been inspired by the identification of Ianus, represented as double-faced and with the keys in his hand, with the lion-headed being we have described above, also holding the keys and also (see Cumont, Te.rtes et Mon., I, p. 75, note 5) originally two-headed. 24 See on these C.

The idea of Aion, eternal Time, is now clearly dis- tinguished from the subdivisions of Chronos into past, present, and future, of which indeed the non-existence is pointed out. On the other hand, Chronos is distinguished from Kacpo6, time in a generic sense, from time in relation to human activity, from " opportune time." 26 TwO passages by a thinker belonging to the Neopythagorean circle, Plutarch, oppose in fact Chronos on the one hand and Aion on the other: "And as for that on which we most rely to support our conception of time, as we utter the words, 'it is here,' ' it is at hand,' and ' now '-all this again reason, entering in,27 demolishes utterly. For 'now' is crowded out into the future and the past, when we would look upon it as a culmination; for of necessity it suffers division.

In this school the conception of Aion is opposed to Chronos in the same relationship as that of vovs' to vXivy: as against the running Chronos, Aion stands immutable, constant, and eternally like himself.31 rfhese quali- ties, emerging more and more in the late philosophical speculation, make him more and more nearly identical to the divinity itself. Althotugh the wide diffusion of the concepts we are dealing with in Orphic doc- trines and in poptular religion may have inspired artistic representations of their personifications, in our mosaic at least we do not find any trace of the fantastic and confused images described for them in the mystic texts. But as pure speculation in philosophy and literature has coexisted with its transformation into religious and mystic conceptions, so allegories in montrous shapes have coexisted in art with per- sonification in human shapes of the ideas referring to Time. These have left us a testimony from very early times indeed, that is, the only other ancient monument, beside our mosaic, indisputably representing Aion, whose name is determined by an inscription: a very fragmentary red-figured Attic vase in Karlsruhe (Fig. 7).32 Here Aion was introduced into a scene of the Underworld together with Orpheus and Eurydice: only a part of his head remains, with a hand on his forehead in a thoughtful and sorrowful attitude. The only representation of Chronos determined in the same way by an inscription is the winged youth in Homer's Apotheosis; 33 he stands behind the poet, together with Oikoumnene wrho lays a garland on his head, and holds a roll. We do not need to deal here with the personifications of the subdivisions of time, such as the Horae and the months of the year, which had the widest diffusion because they entered into the illustrations of the ancient calendars. We may only mention that a personification of the Year himself, Eniautos, appeared wearing a tragic costume in the famous Pompe of Ptolemy II; he was accompanied by a rarer personification, that of Penteteris, with the palm of V7ictory in her hand; she was followed by the Horae.34 The existence, at least, of another allegory of Aion in human shape in late 30 H.

The image is roughly carved on an amulet of the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna,42 in a black stone, the shape of which recalls a prehistoric axe. It is well known, indeed, that these prehistoric implements were considered in historical ages especially fit for magical purposes. The demon is here, too, bearded, but shows a bald head ". adorned with horns; 4 his left hand rests on his breast. The amulet seems too big to be hung around the neck like a rEpia,.qa, and more fit for a house 5bvXaKn77pt0V. But the figure of Aion on our mosaic, in spite of its fragmentary state, casts a bright light upon a mtuch discussed iconographic problem, and one destined perhaps to remain unsolved without the discovery of new decisive arguments such as that offered by the Antiochene monument. We have before us the figure of an old man with long white hair and beard, such as Aion is usually depicted, for instance in the Nonnus verses quoted above. But the curved object he holds with his out-stretched right hand is not a veil, as has been claimed, nor a roll. If continued beyond the fracture, it would describe a complete circle. It appears to be of solid material, not fluctuating, and its edges, drawn in perspective, are imagined as running parallel: it is in fact a wheel, probably of nmetal, thin, gray in color with brown edges. Con- sequently wve have before us the first certain and indisputable artistic representation of Aion such as he often appears to us in poetical descriptions, turning the wheel of life, or of the human seasons. We may find a vague image of this conception as early as Pindar (Isthm., VIII, 14 f.): &amp;0Xtog yap auwV ear av6bpacr KpEqJLraa, EXiGorO /3LOV iT OpOV. But if we descend through many centuries, down beyond the age of our mosaic (but to about the age to which the original of the Utrecht Psalter may be attributed), in a passage by Nonnus the poet who uses the image of Aion more often than any surrounded by snakes, had originally in all probability a human head, since a leonine mask is repre- sented on its breast: see Cumont, Comptes Rentdus de l'Acad. des Inscr. et Belles-Lettres, 1905, p. 149, fig. 42 R.

It is as Aion that we recognize now, consequently, another figure that appears in a similar attitude, turning a wheel, but now specified as the wheel of the Zodiac. The figure appears, to be precise, in a different aspect, not as a bearded old man but as a vigorous youth, standing within the wheel or near- by on three well-known monuments, associated with other allegories or con- nected with other monuments clearly related to mystic cults. These three monu- ments are: the silver lanx from Para- biago (Figs. 12-13), and the two mosaics from Sentinum, modern Sassoferrato (Fig. 14) and Hippo Regius in Algeria (Fig. 15). The youth, half-draped on the silver plate and on the African mo- saic, in the former holds a scepter, and is supported within the wheel by Atlas and flanked by a snake wound around a bethel, in the latter holds the horn of abundance; he is naked, his head crowned with a rich wreath of flowers, on the .. -~~~~~~ 0 Fi. 3 Dtilo Fgre1 mosaic of Sentinum.

And no wonder. We have said that.originally the Hellenic Aion was not at all conceived as the supreme and eternal principle of the universe, but only as a period of time renewing itself, a duration of time repeating itself (and especially that of the year). In the cosmogonies preserved to us this subordinate position is made clear by the denomination of Aion as the son of Kronos, or of a Virgin, or of Helios.5" Slowly, however, the old conceptions of the astral mythology were transformed under the influence of the speculations of the theologians. To the divinized Aion are applied the definitions which philosophy had attributed to the cosmic principles of Time. This last conception of Aion-Time approaches conseqtuently that abstraction of Time which played an important role in the doctrines of the Chaldaic oracles, from which the mysteries of Mithras were derived. Now can flow- together into the conception of Aion all qualities of endless Time, the primeval cause of all things, such as is the character of the old Persian divinity Zervan Akarana whom a sect of magicians placed indeed at the origin of the world as the king of the celestial hierarchies, and from whom both the good god Ahura, Mazda and the evil god Ahriman were born.52 Ex- pressions, stch as we have already fotund for the late god of the classical world, are used for this divinity: aClTava-1ToV Ev aicaoriotg acd&amp;vog vEpLo8otsg (Dio Chrysostom, Orat. XXXVI 42; ed. G. Bude, II, Leipzig, 1919, p. 16). The image of the wheel, finally, which we have seen suddenly appear in the artistic repertory of late antiquity for Aion, goes back to him as well: the figure which we have met with before may exactly fit the inage as described by Proclus, " alwvays tturning an untiring wheel and staying in it." Again the poetical images of Hellenic classical literature agree exactly with the religious content of the oriental doctrines. The deity who moves the beginnings of things, and who stands immobile in the center of the wheel, recalls the statue of Aion, 51- ["MtE] J1 o' ?rarqp rov raXtryEvovs A' vo : Pap. Gr.

It is certaini that originally there was nothing in common between Aion and the Babylonian divinities (see Cumont, in Corptes Rendus cit., 1928, p. 279). We may accept also Nock's affirmation (loc. cit., p. 82) that "so far as I know, Aion never renders Zervan," or rather that (p. 86) " Aion is not actually used of Zervan." This does not destroy, however, the general and plausible opinion that, together with Semitic, Egyptian, and other elements, also elements characteristic of Zervan con- tributed through Mithraism in shaping the complex figure of Aion in the syncretistic religion and thought of late antiquity. 3 Kat 8LVEtV LLEL r ElELY KJ9 YTpoa JL7yL (Proclus, -In Tiniaeu , p. 242 D; ed.

Fragmentary Marble Statue in Arles who was, is, and will be, the immutable and perpetual creator of the phenomena of nature. The wheel, which signifies the endless renewal of the phenomena of nature, is a symbol entirely akin to the circle of the Zodiac, indissolubly asso- ciated with the cult of Mithras. Sometimes we see the whole circle of the Zodiac surrounding the representation of the tauroktonos deity.5 Elsewhere, especially on the large re- liefs of Germany, the twelve signs of the Zodiac are carved around the arched upper border of the cave where the bull is immolated: this cave was considered as representing the world, and its border was consequently a symbol of the heavenly vault. We do not wonder, therefore, if the signs of the Zodiac are introduced into the representation of the lion-headed monster symbolizing the Mithriac god of Time, to signify that the sun in its ecliptic successively passes through the twelve constellations. On the fine fragmentary statue at Arles (Fig. 17) all the twelve signs are visible be- tween the coils of the serpent surrounding its body, and probably hinting at the sinuous course of the sun through the sky, while only four signs appear on the statue, also mutilated, in the Vatican Library.56 Another curious sculp- ture, found in the Mithreum of Housestead (Borcovicus) in Northern England (Fig. 18) calls even more sharply to mind the monuments we are dealing with. Here within the ring of the Zodiac the naked torso of Mithras, worked in the round, holding the knife and the flaming torch, appears between the two halves of a sphere or of an egg, one half beneath his waist and the other above his head. But in the confluence of ideas and symbols which characterizes the religious syncretism of late antiquity, the sym- bolism of Mithras passes to other religions and other mysteries as well.

The eternal renewal of the cycles of human life is the obvious meaning of the famous coin struck at Alexandria in A.D. 138-139 by Antoninus Pius on the occasion of the beginning of a new Sothic cycle (Fig. 19 a): the planets are depicted around the bust of Sarapis, and the ring of the Zodiac in an outer circle.60 In the same connection may be classified probably also another Alexan- drian coin of the same Emperor (Fig. 19 b), where the inscription AIQfN surrounds an image of the Phoenix, symbolically representing the renewal of human life.6' The relations between the supreme and immortal divinity and the destinies of the mortal beings appear even more clearly on the coin struck at Nicaea in Bithynia (Fig. 19 c), where Zeus, seated on his throne within the ring of the Zodiac, is flanked by the carriages of the Sun and the Moon, and dominates the figures of the Earth and the Ocean lying at his feet: 62 a compendious representation which immediately recalls the symbolism used for Cybele on the Parabiago laux. Finally the youthful image of Aion himself appears on another coin (Fig. 19 e), 63 this time standing within the wheel with an aspect and an attitude practically identical to those of the god of the Parabiago plate, the mantle falling from the shoulder behind the naked body, but holding in the left hand, instead of the sceptre, a globe on wlhich the Phoenix rests. The coin, which has passed from the Montagu Collection to the British Museum, is an aureus struck by Hadrian during his third consulate (A.D. 119-138), on which the Greek name of the god is translated into one of its Latin equivalents, Saeculum: Saec (ultrn) au- r(eum).

The Seasons, the divisions of Time in its relationship with human life, belong to Mithriac symbolism. Representations of the Zodiac were often painted on the walls of Mithriac temples, while sometimes the signs of the Zodiac, worked separately in bronze, were applied to the walls. These in soine cases were grouped three by three, according to the seasons. We have men- tioned above a statue of the lion-headed demon adorned with four signs of the Zodiac: these are the signs of the months of the solstices and equinoxes, that is, of the begin- nings of the seasons, The Seasons themselves are represented on a conspicuous num- ber of Mithriac monuments.66 'With the Seasons often the Winds are associated, each of which was considered to rule over a period of the year and to determine the climatic conditions to which a season was submitted. We have mentioned before the tradition of Philo according to which Aion himself was a son of the wind god- Kolpias; Aion is invoked, moreover, as god of the four winds in magical texts.67 This is the reason for the conspicuous presence of the Seasons on all our three representations of the god of the Zodiac: Summer and Spring are indeed, in all probability, the two preserved figures in the mosaic from Hippo.68 In the mosaic from Sentinum the opposition between human time and the god of astral eternity is stressed even more by grouping at his feet the four ptitti of the seasons around the figure of the reclining Tellus. Finally on the lana from Parabiago we find again the complete symbolism we have noticed before on the coin of Nicaea, not in direct relation to Aion, but to the gods of the mysteries, Cybele and Attis, as it is to the supreme astral god on the coin. In the mosaic of Hippo the god of the Zodiac, standing outside the ring he is moving with his right hand, holds in his left a horn of abundance the mouth of which is full of grapes; a vine branch with bunches of grapes spreads beyond the Zodiac along the edge on the left of the scene, while colored flowers and twigs are in the field on the right. This does not compel us necessarily to identify the divine youth with Dionysos, 65 E. Strong, Apotheosis and After Life (London, 1915), pl. XXXII; H.

Saxl, Mithras, p. 79. 68 The theatrical masks represented on this mosaic between the Seasons might be an allusion to the masks used in the mysteries of Mithras and in other religious mysteries: see Cumont, Textes et Mon., I, pp. 315 f. Elsewhere masks allude undoubtedlly to the stars: so e. g., above the edge of the great altar at Carnuntum around wlhich the Seasons and the Winds are represented, together with Coelus supporting the vault of the firmament: see ibid., II, no. 228 bis, c, p. 496, figs. 432 ff.</page><page sequence="29">AION 297 represented as a solar god, the dispenser of the fruit of the year: the same meaning indeed is possessed also by the Mithriac deity of Time, who, while bringing the suc- cession of the various seasons. is at the same time the fecuidating god-or on the contrary the destructive god-who brings to maturity the fruit of earth and devours it, according to another passage of the Mythographus Vaticanus quoted before." To this god is given the name Frugifer, which identifies him with the strange divinity of Saeculum Frtigifer worshiped especially at Hadrumetum in Africa and represented on numerous imperial coins, a divinity which is nothing else but a not completely disguised Romanization of the Punic Baal: another confirmation of the confluence into the Mithriac religion of Mazdeian and Semitic elements, like the assimilation of the Phoenician Baal Shamin by Aion in the cosmogony of Philo we have men- tioned above.70 On the plate from Parabiago the figure within the Zodiac holds the scepter, an attribute which we have seen also in the hands of the lion-headed demon. He is flanked by a serpent winding around an obelisk: the bethel is in the Mithriac legend an obvious allusion to the god's birth from a rock, OE6o E'K iEr&amp;pag. Such a rock, besides often appearing associated with the god in his representations, was worshipped in the form of a conical stele in his sanctuaries; some original specimens were found in the Mithrea, and several of them are surrounded by the serpent.71 We have seen, however, that the serpent 72 became also the unfailing attribute of the demon of Time in Mithriac mythology; as such we have seen it also completely detached from the demon's body, and in one case winding about a crater, an object around which it appears also on numerous Mithriac representations. This represented in the Mithrea, according to information by Porphyrius, the source springing from the cave originally consecrated to the cult of Zoroaster.73 On the Parabiago plate, finally, the god of the Zodiac is supported by a naked torso of Atlas, the "faultless Titan," who in fact, according to the Orphic doctrines, had not participated with his brothers in Zagreus' slaughter (see Kern, Orphic. Fragm. no. 215, pp. 235 f.). The Hellenic bearer of the heavenly globe is a motif which was introduced in fact into the Jithriac symbolism and into the oriental religions, where the figure of the Titan appears as an image of the Mithriac deity of Caelus. Similarly in the Mithriac mythology is mentioned a 69 Annuam fecunditatem atque proventum omnium devorat frugumn: Cumont, Textes et Mon., II p. 53, line 11. 70 See Nock loc. cit., pp. 86 f.

Friedlander correctly asserts that nowhere else, either in literature or in art, does Atlas lift the disc of the sun. But here too we do not gather from the poet's words 79 that it is a question of the solar disc, but rather of the sphere of the universe, evidently represented as a ring-and perhaps as the ring of the Zodiac-in order to leave free space in the center for the divine being.

Upright, it pins the earth and holds it tight, and Atlas in his enduring and tireless eternal strength stands as this steadfast axis. The tips of the axis are fixed in the fiery pole near the southern end and in the dry frozen vault of the north.

We have thus cleared the way to consider another famous and much discussed image of a god in the Zodiac, which differs from those examined before inasmuch as he does not turn the wheel of the Zodiac, but only stands in a majestic attitude within it; this is the relief in Mlodena (Fig. 16). 81 The strange deity shows his beautiful and youthful body in full nakedness, and an imperious and thoughtful head certainly derived from a solar image, while only his bull or goat hoofs depart from human nature. The body, provided with wings, is wrapped about with snake coils, and the tips of a moon-crescent protrude from his shoulders. The god holds the scepter and the thunderbolt; flames rise toward the sky from the two halves of a sphere or a cone placed beneath his feet and over his head; the head of the serpent wound around his body rests on the front of the upper hemisphere.

As regards the excavation of the sanctuary near Trier, see now the first fascicule of the final publication, S. Loeschke, Der Temnpe[bezirk irn Altbachtale zu Trier, I (Berlin, 1938). On this monument, contrary to the description of the painting in Gaza, only the child's bust is represented, naked and wearing the Mithriac Phrygian cap, whose outstretched right hand supports the ring of the Zodiac while the left holds the sphere of the world. A position of the god in the Zodiac more resembling that of the Gaza painting appears on the Borcovicus sculpture we mentioned above (Fig. 18), where the god stretches both arms sidewards so as to reach the ring of the Zodiac. I-His hands, in fact, hold the divine attributes, which however are almost con- cealed against the edge of the Zodiac, and might have escaped the attention of the poet. A similar position recurs elsewhere for the figure of Mithras being born: so, e. g., on the sculpture from the Mithreum of Alt-Ofen near Budapest, Cumont, Textes et Mon., II, no. 213 d, p. 322, fig. 187; Saxl, Mithras, fig. 161, pl. 29. We remark that, as a matter of fact, in John's text the name Helios never does appear. To the divinity of the disc of the universe is often applied the epithet Phaethon, which not only can be justified by the equation Mithras - Sun, but which is used indeed for Mithras by Nonnus, the primary source of John's poetry (see 'Aoov'ptos c?ad0wv, Dionys., XXI, 249 [or 251]; the same epithet can be used also for the Orphic primeval deity: llpwroyo'vos 4c,aw0v, Orph. fragm. 57, Abel, Orphica, p. 175). The position and the attitude of the child within the Zodiac in the Trier relief hint at the birth of the young Sun at the beginning of the year (see Saxl, Mithras, pp. 96 f.): the relief contains, in other words, a symbolism very similar to that attributed by John (lines 56 ff.) to the childish figure supported by Atlas in the Gaza painting. Also the terms used for the object lifted by Atlas do not fit better the image of the sun's disc than that of the sphere of the universe. Sometimes (e. g., in line 66) the word disc is used. Else- where (line 53) it is called K(VO3 a4EptVroT'-TOS, "the high-soaring cone." Its flame (4Xo'e) is related, in lines 69 f., to the 7ro'xo, and a similar image is that in line 95, atyXq o'pavtov Xai7rrTpos. 81 See especially Cavedoni, in Atti e mem'torie della Deputazione di storia patria per Modena e Parina, I, 1863, pp. 1 ff.; F.

The old and ingenious interpretation by Cavedoni, who recognized in this image the Fig. 20. The Birth of Mithras in the Zodiac, Relief from a Mithreum near Trier Orphic god Phanes born from the cosmic egg," reinforced with new arguments by Eisler and L. Deubner, still prevails. On the other hand, the monuments we have examined before, support also Cumont's comparison of this image to the Mithriac god of Time. The explanation was pro- vided to Cumont himself by the recent dis- covery of three Greek Mithriac inscriptions under the slopes of the Aventine near the Tiber. All three are dedications to " Zeus Helios Mithras." In one of them the identi- fication of divinities of different origins proceeds further; this is dedicated " A 'HXk() Mpt3pa DavrqTq...." Here for the first time the introduction of Orphic doc- trines into the mysteries of the Persian god is explicitly and unmistakenly attested. Since Mithras and Phanes were confused into one and the same supreme deity, and since the religious exegesis was applied to assimilate the qualities of the two gods and to conciliate the differences of the two sacred traditions, it is no wonder that we often remain uncertain how to interpret some artistic monuments. The youthful image of the Modena relief is at the same time Mithras and Phanes. Moreover, the assimilation of elements and attributes does not stop here. The serpent surrounding the body of the god does not belong to the image of Phanes as described in the Theogonia, by Hieronymos and Hellanikos (Kern, Orphicorurn Fragmenita, no. 54, pp. 130 ff.), which contains the closest points of resemblance to our relief. It was obviously derived, as Cumont has noticed, from the 82 On the cosmic egg, and the recent studies on this subject, see I. M. Linforth, The Arts of Orpheus, 1941, p. 226, note 25. On the assimilation of Mithras with Phanes, and the confusion of the sphere or the rock of Mithras' birth with the cosmic egg (perhaps, e. g., on the Borcovicus sculpture), see Saxl, Mithras, p. 73, p. 74, note 1.</page><page sequence="33">AION 301 1\lithriac statues of Aion we have examined before. In fact, in the same way as we have previously seen the identification of Aion with the supreme Sun-God, in the Orphic texts Phanes is described as having an aspect entirely similar to that of Chronos, by whom he w),as begotten. The same contamination of different deities and legends and confusion of heterogeneous elements appear also on other monuments. We have seen the two halves of the cosmic egg or sphere above and beneath the bust of Mithras-Phanes on the sculpture from the Mithreum of Borcovicus (Fig. 18), and the lower hemisphere under other representations of the Mithriac " Chronos," especially under the bearded image on the fVXaKTrptov of the Naturhistorisches Museum in VTienna (Fig. 10) perfectly suitable for Aion-Chronos, but not at all becoming to the figure of Phanes coming to life. We have seen the lion-headed demon holding the attributes of the supreme command, and we have noticed on its body the signs of the Zodiac symbolizing its rule over the seasons. In the same way, probably, on our relief the leonine mask is the sign of the Zodiac dominating in midsummer, the ram and the capricorn those presiding over the beginnings of spring and autumn. We have said also that the heads of the winds in the four corners of the relief are related to the conception of the four seasons. The animal hoofs of the god, finally, call to mind, as well as the identification of Phanes with Pan, also the invocations to Aion identified with this god, for the accentuation, we said before, of his character of a panthean deity. A fortunate discovery of recent years, indeed, presents us with one of the monstrous images of Chronos-Aion we have often mentioned before, but this time standing on sheep's legs and hoofs (Fig. 5).S3 The disc of the Zodiac, we were saying, replaces sometimes the sphere of the universe on Atlas' shoulders. If indeed the disc of the Zodiac is the fittest image of the wheel of Time, both as a representation of the rotation of the sky determined by eternal laws and of the first Cause generating and renewing hutmlan destinies, on the other hand the heavenly sphere is another obvious attribute of that first Cause, the globe which is the Empyrean where it has its residence.84 Zervan-T -v ,85 the primeval Cause that rules over human destinies through the rotation of the planets and the revolution of the Zodiac, as early as in the Avesta is usually associated in 83 This is a relief discovered during the last excavations at Oxyrhynchos in Egypt by the Italian Society of Florence: see E.

The statue, similar in all other details to the other specimens of the Mithriac demon, shows higher artistic qualities than usual. A rayed halo appears behind the lion's head; keys and sceptre are held in its hands, from which, furthermore, two snakes creep down, one on each side, to lick respectively a flaming altar and the usual Mithriac crater on the ground. The monstrous tongue develops into another serpent reaching the small altar.

Ahura-Mazda was for ancient Persians "the eternal circle of Heaven": consequent, therefore, is the increasing identification, caused by astrological speculation, of this concept of the eternal Heaven with that of Zervan, the infinite Time ruling over the upper spheres. Thus Ahura-Mazda is invoked in Latin as Caclus aeternus Iupiter; and other alle- gorical representations of the Mithriac Caelus occur in the form of an eagle leaning over the heavenly sphere, adorned with the signs of the planets or with the zodiacal ring. The intermediate nature of Xpovos between the infinite time and the determina- tion of time through the influence of the sky, is repeatedly the object of the Western philosophical speculation.86 We are not surprised, consequently, when we find 87 the lion-headed demon (which we have seen associated with the signs of the Zodiac) standing on the sphere of the globe, either smooth or adorned with the two crossing bands of the Zodiac and the milky-way," or otherwise on a hemisphere adorned with a moon-crescent.

On the other hand, it may well be a derivation from the image of the cosmic god of Egypt and of the East.94 As a matter of fact, symbols and attributes becoming to the supreme deity of the Eastern religions could not meet any difficulty in being applied to the representations of the eclectical doctrines wvhich spread throughout the late classical world. Similar symbols and attributes were familiar indeed as early as the time of the pre-Socratic philosophers to express the ideas referring to the divinity. To god, the primeval being, without a beginning and without an end according to Thales' definition, was compared the sphere, which presents the same peculiarities, and before which we see grouped the seven wise men, meditating, on the two well-known mosaics from Torre Annunziata in Naples and from Sarsina in the Villa Albani: " Haec aeterna manet divisque simillima forma, Cui neque principium est usquam, nec finis in ipsa. (Manilius, Astronomicca, I, 211 f.) Thus are especially defined the peculiarities of the heavenly globe in the exact formu- lation of Aristotle as against Plato's Timaeus (De caelo, I, 10, 280 a). And, by antithesis, according to Alcmaeon of Croton (see H. Diels, Die Frcgmente der Vorso- krcatiker5, I [Berlin, 19341, p. 215, fr. 2), men are bound to die because they cannot turn the straight line of life into a circle: rovs avG pJnirovs fr1sqv 'A. 8&amp;a roviro airXo-- Xvo-O,at o'rt ov 8vvavrat r3v apXqv rM TEXEA Vpo0-6rat. But the identical expressions and formulas pass from pure speculation to cosmogonic and religious doctrines, to the- world of magic and of mysteries. Thus in an Orphic hymn Uranus has taken up all the qualities of the supreme god without beginning and without end, the primeval being and creator of everything, which turns around the earth like a sphere.96 Almost with the identical words Isis or rather perhaps Isis assimilated with Aion-is in- read 'AvaToXV and Av'ns (cf. A. v. Sallet in Zeitschr. f. Numinsmatik, V, 1878, pp. 108 f., p. 350, pl. II, 8). Reitzenstein mentions this coin, in a passage in which he compares Aion to the con- ception of the two-headed Ianus; Orient and Occident would express here the whole extension of the sky. 94 As a matter of fact, as regards the Sol from the Mithreum on the Esquiline, Saxl not only suggests on stylistic grounds the oriental origin of the relief with Mithras tauroktonos from the same find, but proves also that the image of Sol himself because o,f the gesture of his right hand finds an exact parallel on similar fictile representations o;f Egyptian provenance, on which indeed the sphere and the whip on the left are replaced by a crocodile: see Saxl, Mithras, pp. 30 f., figs. 88-89, pl. 17. 95 Schlachter, op. cit., passimt; 0.

The evident meaning of the symbol has appeared to us in the aureus of Hadrian (Fig. 19 e), in which the globe with the Phoenix is held by the youthful image of Saecculum himself, surrounded by the turning wheel. But, in the same way as we have already noticed for the ring of the Zodiac, little by little the symbol of the sphere too becomes devoid of all its original philosophical and religious content; it appears thus on innumerable Roman coins bearing the same meaning as the late meaning of Aion, and merely signifying, like the symbol of Aeternitas, or rather of Aevum, an omen of long life to the Emperor.99 Elsewhere in the later iconography the sphere, sometimes crossed by the two bands of the Zodiac and the milky-way, becomes the material image of the heavenly globe: so, for instance, in the image of Urania and in the representations of the Parcae on the sarcophagi depicting the myth of Prometheus.100 Here the Parcae, standing before the heavenly sphere or before the sundial, have preserved the mere function of reading the horoscope of the newly born child; and to the sphere, of all its former content of thought, only the modest part remains that was tenaciously assured to it, because of its connections with human life, by the superstitious practices of the astrologers.101 In the Pompeian fresco from the Casa di Apolline we have seen the sphere of the cosmic deity of the Gnostics held by a divine figure deriving from the classical iconography. In the same way the marble figure representing the Mithriac god of Time in the Mithreum of Emerita 102 shows a blooming youthful body, surrounded by serpents, and which probably had, as we said before, a human head. But we do not need to adduce the attraction always exerted by the artistic images of the classical world upon the representations of the later syncretistic and mystic religions-an ex- amnple of which wve have mentioned above when speaking of Atlas-in order to explain the youthful aspect of Aion on the monuments where he appears as the god of the Reitzenstein, Poimandres, p. 270: apXrl KaO -rE'Xos J, 7arvr'nv 8E o- pv DavaooEtv EK uE'o yap ravi- E-rt Kat SEl- Ai6Cva -rEEv-r.

We may find the explanation fromn within the mystic religions and the magic literature themselves. In fact, althou-gh Aion mostly appears in them in the form of an old man,103 we may read, in the Mltythographtus Vcaticanus III we have mentioned before, the following passage: Saturnus secunduum fabulam cum sit senex posse fieri puer fingitur, quod commentum ab hac re orturn fertur, quod corpus singulis annis senescere in hieme et rivivescere in vere videtur.104 And Nonnus says similarly 105 that Aion " changes the burden of old age like a snake who sloughs off the coils of the useless old scales, rejttvenescing while washing in the swells of the laws [of time]." The clearest formulation of the conception 1may be quoted from a still later hymn (IX) by Bishop Synesius of Cyrene: aAA amrog acy-paoo , \ e l f AUcOV o 7TaXaLyEV77"' vEo0 COV, acl-a Kat yEpCOV.... And the contrast between the current poetical image of Time as a gray-headed old man and his artistic representation is most strikingly confirmed in the E'K4pacto- of John of Gaza, where Aion is indeed called by the stereotyped poetical formula 7Tpo- 7raojp, but is described on the contrary in his picture as a youth in his full bloom, in shining majesty, radiating light from his body as he sits on Olympus.106 We have thus found as well in literature as in art a convincing confirmation for the inter- pretation as Aion of the winged and naked youth who lifts on his wings to heaven the imperial couple on the base of Antoninus Pius' column (Fig. 22).107 Around his left arm winds the serpent wvhich, together with his powerful wings, recalls the lion- headed demon and the images of the oriental religions; and he holds in his left hand the globe, adorned with the Zodiacal ring, the moon, and the stars. The monuments have thus reflected to us the multiplicity of the conceptions expresseed by Aion in thought and religion of late antiquity. On one hand the symbols flowing over to the primeval and supremie god of Time from the religions of the East as well as from the speculations of thle West in the doctrines of magic and mysteries, appear crystallized in the lion-headed demon; on the other hand, for the cosmog,onic divinity is forged an anthropomorphic image, by which already classical art had visualized the concept of time of Hellenic philosophical speculation, and whose atti- tudes, attributes, and associations may be derived either from the philosophical thought 103 Lackeit, Aion, pp. 89 ff. 104 Ctimont, Textes et Moni., II, p. 53, ? 8. 105 Dionys., XLI, 180 ff.: . . yr$paos JXOos J1)d/3Uv, | ( S4, s C pavEwv foX8&amp;v Cotp' TLVJ4cLn ftvraXtv r 'o-,EcvE XEXovkEdvo3 oitkawnt &amp;cutkCov.

This may be introduced with its own meaning, by now universally understandable, into a representation of oriental mysteries. It is quite true that in this age Aion is a fluid conception; 108 and no wonder, since we have seen converging to it from the most different sources a multitude of ideas and terms, often Fig. 22. Aion on the Base of the Column of Antoninus Pius disagreeing among themselves, from philosophical speculation and from religion, from the East and from the West.'09 The name of Aion may well be used often as a mere attribute, since its essence is nothing else than the first quality from immemorial times assigned by philosophy to the primeval divine being; furthermore Aion is the quality which religion and mysticism assign to the supreme deity, under whatever name he is worshiped. As this first quality of the supreme being Aion himself becomes a god, but he may still be distinguished from the supreme being, whose first born child he is, 108 This is the point on which Nock especially insists. We shall not entirely follow, however, his most radical conclusions, such as " there was not under the Empire a well-known and influential complex of ideas about Aion " (loc. cit., p. 99); that " it was not a proper nom.en-hardly an individuality" (p. 84), etc. 109" So ist auch die Gestalt des Gottes Aion ein typischer Vertreter der gnostisch-synkretistischen Bewegung, in der sich orientalisch-religi6se Vorstellungen mit der Gedankenwelt der griechischen Philosophie umkleiden und dadurch diese seltsam schillernden Gestalten hervorrufen, deren Wesen uns so schwer fassbar ist": Zepf, loc. cit. in note 9, p. 274.</page><page sequence="40">308 DORO LEVI a 8EVrEpoS OEOaS'.0 On the other hand it has appeared to us by all evidence that Aion is not merely a name running from mouth to miiouth, but that it has assumed itself by now, in cosmogony as well as in the world of magic, the pantheistic meaning of the supreme and primordial divinity of the mysteries, that Aion has become himself one of the panthean deities of this late syncretistic religion. So much the less shall we be surprised, consequently, when we find used for him adjectives and attributes which occur endlessly also for other deities, which we may rather say are granted practically to each divinity rising to the rank of supreme and panthean deity. If in the magic invocations a'i'v may, be used certainly as a mere attribute of the god invoked, it appears certain, notwithstanding, that other times Ahwv is the name of one of the divinites identified with the supreme god. Nay, sometimes, the position of his name is specially emphatic, revealing both the great value attributed to its expression in magic practices, and the first rank attributed to it among the denominations of the supreme being, in the same way as the essence of Aion is his first quality."' By Apollo himself Aion is described as the supreme divine being in one of the oracles from Claros: "a fire rising above the cavity of heaven, continuously in movement, infinite." He is invisible even to heavenly powers if he does not want to reveal himself; and his name is unspeakable."2 The same terms occur everywhere in the magic papyri."3 In the Berlin papyrus describing him standing on the sphere of the universe, he is invoked as the primordial bleing (rpoarcorwp . . . acdvaWE Atov) ,," and in the Leiden papyrus he is invoked as iTavroKpacTop 6Eos, the ruler of the generations, who nourishes and makes everything to prosper, " who has a secret, unpronounceable name." And in fact the identical invocations return in two other magic passages, where, however, the name Aion is nlot pronounced."' We have seen before in the great magic papyrus 110av Et o varrjp roi3 7raXvyevoi3' Awvos (Pap. Gr. Mag., VII, 510; vol.

We have mentioned before also other identifications with the supreme solar god of the Egyp- tians, and we have seen the mystic deity of Time assume his attributes. In the same way we have noticed the identification of Aion with other pantheistic divinities. We have seen him little by little usurp the place of Kronos-Chronos, and invested with the same peculiarities. In the passage by Suidas where his statue at Alexandria is mentioned, it is affirmed that the Alexandrians identify him with Osiris and Adonis, and in Philo of Byblos the name of Aion covers the image of another Semitic divinity, Baal Shamin. Athenagoras tells us that Isis was considered as "the nature of Aion." 1 In other magic texts we find indeed the equation of Isis to Aion and to Noica: it mav be that the magic amulet we have mentioned before with a beggar standing on a sphere " like Isis " hints at this identification.118 The convergence of religious ideas of East and West is noticeable in other identifications. Thus in a passage by Ioh. Lydus (De mensibus, [V, 64) Aphrodite's birth from the genitalia of Kronos is explained as her birth from Aion, and in another passage (ibid., IV, 17) one of the Dioscuri is called Aion, and the other Physis: the Twins, indeed, repre- senting life and death, mortality and eternity, have assumed also the significance of the two heavenly hemispheres, and may appear consequently on both sides of our lion- headed demon.119 We have seen, finally, our pantheistic deity as an object of cult, of magic practises and of mystic ceremonies. Beside the cult-statue at Alexandria, we have mentioned the statue of Aion which stood, in the age of Augustus, on the basis of Eleusis on which its dedication was preserved to us.120 The qualities of bene- factor attributed to Aion in the Eleusinian mysteries, are very similar to those extolled in the invocations of the magic texts. Thus we read, for instance, in a prayer which 'Eir4a'vtos regarding the ceremonies of the god Aion. We should not wonder, consequently, since we have seen his-frequent identification with Chronos, to see this latter name used for the mystic deity showing the characteristics of Zervan in the Orphic theogony of Hieronymus-Hellanicus (0. Kern, Orphicorum Fragmenta [Berlin, 1922], p. 130, no. 54; Nock, loc. cit., p. 82, note 96). Here also the appellative Herakles is used, that is, the name of another god also identified often in Eastern-Hellenic mysticism with the solar deities (on this point see Pauly-Wissowa, R.E., s.v. Herakles, Suppl. III, col. 1104; Saxl, Mithras, p. 78; and also in my paper, Antioch-on-the-Orontes, III, 1941, p. 230). 117 Legatio, 22, 6 (ed.

'ApX., 1887, cols. 112 if., no. 33. The presence of a serpent would exclude by itself Perdrizet's hypothesis,-very unlikely on other grounds as well,-according to which the statue at Eleusis did not represent the Mithriac and Orphic deity, but the Egyptian bird Bennou, the equivalent of the Greek Phoenix: see Mon.

It is after all the image of the old philosophical and poetical conceptions, which we have already found in Pindar's description of Aion turning the wheel of time, but which is imbued now with a richer religious content and with an astrological meaning as well. The wheel of time moved by the cosmic god has assumed the aspect of the ring of the Zodiac, the symbol of the heavenly spheres, and at the same time the allusion to human destinies dictated by the supreme being and ruled by astral laws, which astrological science can interpret. This is why Aion, the cosmic god, may be identified with the E4tap/itEv'q, in the same way as Zervan may be called TvX'q, and why Tellus and the seasons, the aspects of time in relationship to humanity, are his un- failing associations. But this artistic type was created only in the late age,126 in which 12 Reitzenstein, Poimlandres, p. 30; Pap. Gr. AMag., IV, 3167. 122 Ref utatio omnium Haeresiumi, V, 8, 45, p. 97, line 19, ed. P.

This is made evident by the fact that the sanme figure may appear also, in the mosaic of Antioch, devoid of any religious meaning, depicting with the very image provided by the old poetical description a purely philosophical conception. A valuable com- mentary on this is offered by the mosaic's inscriptions. And if the god of the Zodiac is represented as befits the solar and cosmogonic being, as a blooming and resplendent youth, Aion on the Antioch mosaic, more suitably to the common philosophical and literary image, has the aspect of an old man. But we have said that a youthful image was not excluded even for the representation of the philosophical conception of Aion elaborated by the Neoplatonics, and further that Aion appeared as a youth on the painting described by John of Gaza. From the monuments we have previously ex- amined we have gained much light for a correct interpretation of this poet's passage referring to Aion (lines 137 ff.), of which we may venture now a new translation: " And self-sown Aion was represented in blooming splendor leaning toward another running circle 127 of the much-whirled years, the forefather, surrounded by the ever- running roads; he, who, preserving the generation in an intellectually perceptible ro- tation, and lifting the whirling helm of flarmony, herds the year of twelve months turning it around, and causes one year to discharge itself into another, then noisele~sly creeps away. . . ." Aion, much as the figure on our mosaic, is sitting on Olympus, century after Christ. The particular popularicy of the concept of Aion in the age of the Antonines is evidenced both by the monuments and by the literary tradition. To this age belongs the only great monument exactly datable, that is, the base of the column of Antoninus Pius. We have seen that in the year 138-139 the name of Aion was associated with the image of the Phoenix on the coins of Antoninus Pius perhaps celebrating the inauguration of a new Sothic cycle. To this age the hymns by Mesoniedes belong. Also the creation of this new iconographic type of the god of the Zodiac might seem, consequently, to confirm Nock's conclusion (loc. cit., pp. 95 ff.) that Aion's cult at Alexandria must be an institution of this time as well, and probably due to the same occasion of the coinage. But for this conclusion it is necessary to resort to the extrema ratio of considering as an interpolation the passage by Ioh. Lydus containing the reference to Aion's festival on the 5th of January which we have quoted before (J)e mens., IV, 1). If we accept this passage, we must go at least as far back as the end of the Republican age for the celebration of the festival. And, furthermore, the existence of a mystic cult dedicated to Aion already in the age of Augustus seems to be confirmed by his statue at Eletusis belonging to this age. In addition to the monuments dealt with above, see also the mention of an amethyst with an in- scription probably reading Aion (AIQN), and the conjecture that on another amulet the inscription tao/ is isopsephic for aW'0v, Nock, loc. cit., p. 84, note 103. 127 lIo'Xo3 is used not only for the heavenly vault, but also for a circle, such as the orbit of a star: see, e. g., Plato, Epin., IX, 986 C: TOZt 8E TE Ttva liotpav rarTEv TE Ttva xpovov, Ev w &amp;4EexEETat TO\V av'Tov 7roAXov ---"but to none of them let us appoint either a certain lot or a certain time in which it travels through its particular orbit. . . ." In an opposite way, a globe may represent an orbis, like the orbis anni (cf. Livy, I, 19, 6: anno qui solstitiali circumagitur orbe) upon which Tellus rests her right hand on some Hadrianic coins; see J. M. C. Toynbee, The Hadrianic School (Cambridge, 1934), p. 142, pl. VI, 23.</page><page sequence="44">312 DORO LEVI and probably turning the wheel of Time, but he appears in shining youthful aspect.128 He is again differentiated, however, from the supreme and primeval being, who, in form of a solar deity appears as a child rising in the center of the universe, repre- sented by the disc of heaven supported by Atlas' shoulders. On the mosaic of Antioch we have perhaps an illustration of the arguments of discussion in the intellectual classes of the Antiochene society: a subject of philo- sophical discussion fit to entertain the nobility of the luxurious town during the sumptuous and everlasting banquets celebrated in the very halls and triclinia whiclh similar mosaics were destined to embellish. The inscriptions of the mosaic seem to present to us the title of an argument for an evening's discussion, corresponding almost exactly to the title of the book of Plotinus' Enneads we referred to before: "lEp~ t6Av'oV Ka Xp6i'ow." Beginning from the age to which our mosaic belongs, in fact, the mosaics representing at least single personification of philosophical concep- tions, if not complex ideas as that with which we have dealt, multiply themselves in Antioch.129 All these may be an illtustration of the philosophical movement in the learned and religious metropolis. They may be also, however, a mere testimony of the conceptions which were passing from mouth to mouth, of words which were much in the air, which were used more or less by everybody, excerpta of philosophical specu- lation which together with religious and mystic ideas had passed over, as would often happen, into popular philosophy. In the same way, already much before the time of our mosaic, philosophical doctrines of Orphism are transformed into formulas of popular wisdom in the funeral epigram of Hecataeus in distant Panticapaeum in Crimea.'30 But perhaps the mosaic of Antioch does not aim to be either exclusively a figured representation of a philosophical speculation, or that of a current conception. Opposite to eternal Time moving the everturning wheel are seated and intent on a solemn religious function the three fugacious times, transient like man's life. For the representation of the various aspects of the conceptions of Time, the artist would be irresistibly lured to bestowv upon the image of Aion, together with the char- acteristics befitting its content of thought, at least the most peculiar attribute it had by now obtained in the artistic repertory. He must be satisfied, on the contrary, to differentiate the other figures-which nowhere else appear to us in ancient art-only 128 Lines 145 f.: Ev yLap 'OXivtrp kbat8pops pCt. . . . The action of moving the wheel by the uplifted hand nmay have been somewhat indistinct, as it is on many of the silnilar monuments we are dealing with, especially because of the fact that this hand was holding a group of folds of the mantle. John may easily have overlooked the most important feature in Aion's gesture, concerned as he was with the symbolical interpretation of his apparel. 129 See G. Downey, " Personifications of Abstract Ideas in the Antioch Mosaics," Transactions of the Amer.

He groups these figures in a conventional banquet-scene, to which the presence of the incense-burner gives the obvi-ous meaning of one of the ritual banquets particularly peculiar to the religious and nmystic associations of his age. We may perhaps point out a last element, which seems to be quite new and unique in ancient art, in a detail used for the characterization of the conception represented by one of these figures, precisely in the strange modelling of Mellon's body. His torso seems to be painted with colors entirely different from those generally used for naked bodies, with dark tawny tones, with shades of red and violet; they may be meart, consequently, to signify the mist which is still enveloping the Future, before he acquires the clear appearance of present reality.13' Aion is displaying only the activity assigned him by philosophy and poetry, he has not the aspect of a cosmogonic deity nor the character and the attitude proper to a magic talisman. Our mosaic is neither a profession of faith, a kind of a perpetual hymn renewed by a mystes to his divinity, as we have interpreted another mosaic of Antioch in the House of the Isiac Mysteries; nor is it a prophylactic means to avert bad luck, such as we have recognized in the mosaics of the House of the Evil Eye.132 It is the representation of a philosophical concept. It is not improbable, however, that to the very artistic representation of Aion-a philosophical concept, but indissolubly bound by now also to the name of a pantheistic divinity-a supernatural power was attributed, similar to that exerted by the very presence of the statuary image of a god within a house, even without the practice of ;a cult devoted to him. In the artistic expression of the purely philosophical conception of Aion, to which in this age, however, so rich and lively religious content had been conveyed both in scientific speculation and in popular wisdom, a kind of wish was bound to be implicit. Its presence may have been almost an equivalent to one of those ?fvXaKT-7pta which lower social classes and more superstitious people used to bury beneath the foundations of the house for its safeguard, and among which we believe we have recognized one with the very image of Aion (Fig. 10). From the contempla- 131 The increasing importance of color and light in the painting of late antiquity appears, e. g., from the descriptions by John of Gaza. Flesh-color is accurately described, varying according to the nature of the person represented: the complexion of Sophia is pale, that of laborious Virtue is brown, the face of the personification of Summer is sunburnt. Attire, as well as lights and shadows, may accentuate the color of the complexion (see Friedlknder, op. cit., pp. 220 ff.). The importance of color in painting is stressed again in a passage by Chorichius of Gaza, when he says that he would represent the allegorical figures of 'ApcET4 and 'ApX, et TEXVWI T7V Z V$L8OS 1Kv)OLvV Kat Kpaoas XPXpw/aToV ELOCt TO E7rtTrJ8Evfia qv (Ebg 'ApacTtov SoviKa, 6, ed.
