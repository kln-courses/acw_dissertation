<plain_text><page sequence="1">William Huse Dunham jr* THE SPIRIT OF THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION: FORM AND SUBSTANCE 'The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.' 2 Corinthians 3:6 The British found their 'blessed constitution' only in the 1680s, but half a century later they discovered that it had a spirit. Just as every respectable pyramid must have its sphinx, so every respectable constitution, they felt, needed a spirit. The spirit of this British constitution has enjoyed both form and substance, for it has contained the values, the attitudes, and the moods that prevailed for a time-being, an era, or an age. The design for thinking, the structure of contemporary thought, and the mode that governed current philosophy, morality, and aesthetics were what determined the form that this emanation assumed. Moreover, men carried these criteria over into political contexts, and they applied them to their constitutional concepts. So, for them form frequently took the shape of metaphor and analogy, as is the case when men feel more strongly than they reason. At the end of the middle ages, in fact to the end of Elizabeth I's reign, Englishmen had used anthropomorphic analogies to depict the body politic, but with the advent of seventeenth-century scientific thinking, they turned to mechanical meta- phors to depict the functioning of government. Architectural and aesthetic analogies appeared in the Georgian era, while in Queen Victoria's golden days biological and organic figures determined the form in which men described constitutional governance. More recently, in this age of sports, gamenomorphism has characterized attempts to explain contemporary politics and government. In the history of British constitutionalism (a word first used about 1832) metaphor and analogy have helped to create a unity out of the various concepts of governance; but they have been something more than illustration for, paradoxically, in the transmutation of values they have been cause as well as consequence. Their use has brought together the rules and principles of government into a single concept, constitution- alism, and as an operative belief this has worked to co-ordinate the several parts of government. Over all, however, there has ruled the set of values that men, at any given moment, have called the spirit of the constitution. This nebulous notion has functioned to bridge the gap between public law and morality. In fact, the spirit of the constitution has been for over two hundred years a synonym for constitutional and political morality, one *George Burton Adams Professor Emeritus of History and Former Master of Jonathan Edwards College in Yale University.

The connection between law and morality is one of mutual dependence, and in April 1969 Chief Justice Wyzanski wrote, 'the law grows from the deposits of morality. Law and morality are, in turn, debtors and creditors of each other.'1 Men have also used the spirit of the constitution to sanction the fundamental principles of governance, the established institutions of church and state, and reform and revolution. Above all, that spirit has determined for a time-being the sense of fitness in governance. The criteria used to measure what was fit and what was not, men have labelled the spirit of the constitution. For Britons, a sense of fitness has meant what they believe to be not repugnant to their notion of the constitution. During each of the two world wars, for example, Britons accepted an extension of parliament's life from the statutory five- year limit to seven and nine years. This seemed to them neither repugnant nor unconstitutional, nor against the spirit of the constitution, but simply expedient. A few logicians may have taken umbrage and found comfort in Dicey's doctrine of the sovereignty of parliament; but when that principle is taken literally, it becomes nihilistic and denies the existence (in logic) of any constitution, even an unwritten one. What has preserved constitutional governance in Britain from an over- mighty sovereign and a too sovereign state has been the spirit of the constitution. It has proved to be a political imperative and has produced a code of conduct consisting of rules, ethics, and beliefs that constitutes Britain's political morality. As an operative idea, this belief in the spirit of the constitution has played upon men's emotions, not just upon their minds, and it has created a faith beyond the mere rationale of government. The queen may make warm and human that cold abstraction called the crown, and she may remind her subjects and citizens that the state is truly one body politic 'compact of all sorts and degrees of people,' as Henry vm's statute put it, 'all manner of folk residents or subjects within this his realm.'2 In the same way, the spirit of the constitution has ameliorated the rigour of the public law that controls the procedures used by the governors to rule this corporation aggregate of many individuals, whether styled state, com- munity, commonwealth, or kingdom. As such, the spirit of the constitution transcends the frame of government itself for it has sanctioned the principles of governance and also the belief that Britain has a constitution. 'The work- ing of a constitution,' Pollard wrote in 1920, 'never really depends upon its form, but upon the spirit which informs it.'3 To sense this spirit is, perhaps, easier than to analyze its substance for it is quite impalpable. One comes to know rather than to learn, to accept instead of ascertaining, the various values whose conjunction constitutes a code for governance. The problem 1.

He told the House of Commons: 'I presume I shall hardly be asked to define what I mean by the "spirit of the constitu- tion." '4 Since the disclosure of this spirit in the 1730s, it has been at best a thing nondefined or ill-defined, simply a sense of fitness clearly understood and assumed to exist, yet seldom expressed in finite terms. By the 1860s, the constitution's spirit had become an idea that animated the constitution itself. It had begun the transmutation of the English constitution from a static concept of a frame of government, an idea rigid if not deadened, into one that Bagehot in 1867 called an 'ever-altering,' 'a living constitution' that 'is changing daily.'5 As an inspiring, animating principle, the constitution's spirit had become a receptacle of men's emotions, and into it they poured their desires and sentiments, their opinions and prejudices, and their atti- tudes and moods. The idea has been useful, but the spirit also may be a dangerous one, for it is volatile, nebulous, amorphous, fluid, slippery, and seldom tangible. At times, the constitution's spirit has seemed a mere will- o'-the-wisp, a mirage, an hallucination or illusion, perhaps only a bit of ectoplasm. Undefined, the spirit of the constitution has been the live part of a nonexistent constitution, one to which Blackstone attributed 'vitals.' Moreover, this mystic concept has provided an urge that has driven men on to preserve constitutional government in Britain. The bench, the bar, and parliament have all invoked this spirit. They have used it, at one time and another, for one purpose or another, to combat claims, demands, or asser- tions that seemed outrageous or preposterous. And so the spirit of the constitution has served to test words and deeds that some men felt might be repugnant to their constitutional morality. Politicians and lawyers have used the constitution's spirit, as a barometer of unconstitutionality, to denounce an opponent's contentions or to obstruct undesired and displeasing proposals. Even Dicey, when he tried to expound 'the meaning of an "unconstitutional" law' in 1914, resorted to the spirit of the constitution in order to define the 'expression "unconstitutional." ' He found three different meanings for the word according to whether the con- stitution concerned was the English, the French, or the American. For Britain, he concluded, 'the expression, as applied to an English Act of Parliament, means simply that the Act in question, as, for instance, the Irish Church Act, 1869, is in the opinion of the speaker, opposed to the spirit of the English constitution; it cannot mean that the Act is either a breach of law or is void.'" Such circuitous reasoning marks much of British constitutional thinking. The words, 'constitution' and 'constitutional,' and the phrase, 'the spirit of the constitution,' are often used interchangeably to 4. 1 Emden, Selected Speeches on the Constitution (London, 1939) 67. 5.

Things that men hold to be repugnant to the spirit of the constitution are considered void; and things, like 'abstract questions of sovereignty or supremacy,' repugnant to most Englishmen, are said to be against the spirit of the constitution. E.C.S. Wade (despite Austin, Hol- land, and Dicey) believed it quite 'possible to appreciate the working of the constitution without discussing the theory of sovereignty.'7 More re- cently, the High Court justices have found hostile to the spirit of the consti- tution the abuse and nonuse of administrative powers by departmental tribunals and their little tyrants.8 The Frank Committee's Report of the Committee on Administrative Tribunals and Enquiries prompted parlia- ment to enact in 1958 the Tribunals and Inquiries Act to circumscribe their authority and actions.9 This Act followed the justices' efforts to straighten out tribunal procedures and to bring these 'quasi-judicial' bodies into line with the principles of the common law. The act allowed for appeals to the common law courts, it prescribed suitable procedures conforming to estab- lished judicial principles, and it required 'the giving of reasons for decisions of tribunals and ministers.' Furthermore, these reforms also worked to re- inforce the spirit of the constitution for the Frank Committee's Report had laid stress upon 'openness, fairness, and impartiality.' 0 Of the various components of the constitution's spirit, fairness, reason- ableness, and balance are the three that have been current since the dis- covery of the spirit. Reasonableness, inherited from eighteenth-century Britain, has at times kept even the spirit of the constitution from exceeding the bounds of the preposterous, while balance has served to maintain justice between the state and the individual. Fairness, however, has also become one of the dominant values that compose the constitution's spirit, and this criterion derives, it seems, from the long prevailing belief in sports and games. A cult, the rules of the game, has supplanted formal theology and the established ecclesiasticism as a constitutional sanction. Like so many successful ideas in Britain, gamenomorphism entered into its political con- text through a back door. That is, it had a negative, a derisive debut. Sir Robert Peel recognized its advent, 10 May 1834, when he wrote: 'the refusal of office by the leader of a party would be a very unpopular act with all those who consider political life a mere game, in which office is the prize to be attained and retained by any means that can be employed.'1 In the 1830s, the values of reasonableness and balance were still the dominants, and they run back to the advent of the constitution's mystic spirit, ironically, in the middle of the Age of Reason. When Bolingbroke wrote about the constitution's spirit in 1738, he 7. Wade and Phillips, Constitutional Law (London, 1931) 4. 8. R. F. V.

He believed that it had lived and that it had even languished a bit, for he recorded, 'the spirit of the constitu- tion revives.'12 Three decades later, Blackstone designated the aspects of the spirit of George m's constitution as a trinity: the spirit of his ancestors, the spirit of the age, and the spirit of humanity. This last reflects the new ascending emotionalism, that romanticism whose advent in Britain was occurring coincidentally with Evangelicalism and social reform. For Black- stone, 'the feelings of humanity' accommodated a transcendant morality, one that might, on occasion, supersede law itself. For, he explained, it is found by experience, that whenever the unconstitutional oppressions, even of the sovereign power, advance with gigantic strides and threaten desolation to the state, mankind will not be reasoned out of the feelings of humanity; nor will sacrifice their liberty by a scrupulous adherence to those political maxims, which were originally established to preserve it ... though the positive laws are silent, experience will furnish us with a very remarkable case [James ii's deposi- tion in 1688] wherein nature and reason prevailed.l3 Thus Blackstone drew upon the Enlightenment for values that surmounted the law and the constitution itself. He grounded them upon experience, reason, or nature - that indefinable, hence useful, source of the authoritative. As part of the spirit of mankind, he included the risky criterion, 'the safety of the whole.' He declared that when men's safety, or necessity, required, then they might resort to 'the exertion of those inherent, though latent, powers of society, which no climate, no time, no constitution, no contract, can ever destroy or diminish.' Blackstone's stress upon sheer goodness led him to reason that members of parliament, in Britain, 'make only such laws as are good.' These legislators did this, he argued, logically enough, because they 'will themselves become private men, and subject to the full extent of the laws which they have enacted for others ... [and so they] will think themselves bound, in interest as well as duty, to make only such laws as are good."' Here the judge believed that the parliamentarians' virtue and wisdom in so doing belonged not only to the spirit of the constitution, but as well to the spirit of their own age and to that of their ancestors. The spirit of their ancestors meant to these Georgians the very nature of things, things and ideas inherited from the past that carried with them the sanction of antiquity. Customs, meaning the prevailing parliamentary privileges and the established procedures, some of them dating no further back than 1689, enjoyed ancestral blessing. When seventeen peers dissented in 1763 from the resolution that condemned John Wilkes's North Briton No. 45 as 'a false, scandalous, and seditious Libel,' they, too, invoked 'the spirit of our ancestors,' one that had thus far successfully 'preserved in- 12.

The same year the House of Commons thanked the sheriffs of London for burn- ing up copies of North Briton No. 45 and for suppressing the riot which that event had provoked. For them the House resolved that: 'True liberty consists in that security which the laws and our happy constitution give us, for our persons, our lives, and our property; nor can this valuable blessing be preserved without a due veneration for the legislative authority of the kingdom, and a perfect obedience to the law ...'16 Wilkes himself had extolled obedience to the law in No. 45 and had acknowledged '"that spirit of concord, and that obedience to the laws, which is essential to good order"': but Wilkes also believed that the king's ministers were the ones who had sent '"the spirit of discord through the land."' The rule of law also regarded rich and poor, great and small, as equals before the law, and when Wilkes sued Lord Halifax in 1769, Lord Chief Justice Wilmot thundered from the Common Bench: 'the law makes no difference between great and petty officers. Thank God, they are all amenable to justice, and the law will reach them if they step over the boundaries which the law has prescribed.'7 King George m himself agreed that Wilkes was to be tried 'by due course of law,' and the House of Com- mons, somewhat paradoxically, denied that 'privilege of parliament,' in a case like Wilkes's, 'ought to be allowed to obstruct the ordinary course of the laws.'s8 The same wisdom of their progenitors had equipped these men of property with a right to vote in several places for, as Blackstone smugly stated, 'this is the spirit of our constitution.'19 The same spirit comprehended the spirit of the age - meaning new values and attitudes, or new emphases on old ones. In this Age of Reason, the reasonable, the fair, and the moderate were all being reduced to rules. Wilmot LCJ, instructed the jury in 1769 that if they found for the plaintiff, Wilkes, they should 'give him such damages.' Then, he added, 'give "liberal" damages; by "liberal," I do not mean "excessive ..." the law always con- demns excess; it must be within the rules of reason: the circumstances of the case are to govern it, and as nearly as you can, you will give ... com- pensation, which may bear a proper proportion to the injury ...'20 This jury awarded Wilkes ?4,000. The instinct for reason and balance was strong in Blackstone, too, and he sometimes let it override his logic. He had put sovereignty (for the most part) in parliament and the king as the legisla- 15. Journals of the House of Lords, xxx, 425 (25 November 1763), 429 (29 November 1763). 16.

Yet Blackstone limited the power and absolute authority of its statutes. He tempered this authority with common sense and reason and wrote that acts of parliament 'impossible to be performed are of no validity'; and then he added, should 'any absurd consequences, manifestly contradictory to common reason,' arise from a statute then such an act was to be considered 'void.' Thus Blackstone accepted the common maxim, that acts of parliament contrary to reason are void, but he still adhered, inconsistently, to the doctrine of parliament's omnipotence, because, he wrote 'if the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable, I know of no power that can control it: and the examples usually alleged in support of this sense of the rule do none of them prove, that, where the main object of a statute is unreasonable, the judges are at liberty to reject it; for that were to set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all government.'21 Thus the legislative process, in effect Blackstone's syn- onym for sovereignty, acted to restrict and to balance one attribute of the constitution's spirit, the reasonable. Balance itself is a component of the constitution's spirit that Georgian Englishmen held in high esteem. As a principle, balance governed much in eighteenth-century aesthetics - architecture, drama, letters, poetry and prose, and painting. Proportion and symmetry also went far to accent the value of balance in law and, with its consequents, equipoise and equilibrium, balance was on the way to becoming the quintessence of the constitution's spirit. To offset the preponderance of the burgesses over the knights of the shire in the House of Commons, a statute required the members from the boroughs to have ?300 of landed income. This, Blackstone felt, 'somewhat balances the ascendant which the boroughs have gained over the counties, by obliging the trading interest to make choice of landed men.'22 Other constitutionalists, too, pursued the theme of balance. Their desire for an equilibrium among the parts of government led them to urge an equipoise among the principles and rules of constitutionalism. To make their argu- ments more convincing, some writers turned for their metaphors to mech- anics. During the century before men discovered that the constitution had a spirit, even fifty years before they discovered the constitution's existence, Sir Edward Coke had used a mechanistic metaphor when he compared the working of the law to the smooth regularity in the running of a clock. And in 1735, Sir William Pultney, later the Earl of Bath, wrote to Swift abusing Walpole: 'Were His Majesty inclined tomorrow to declare his body coach- man the first minister, it would do just as well, and the wheels of govern- ment would move as easily as they do with the sagacious driver, who now sits in the box.'23 For Blackstone, too, the government went on wheels.

[and] when he put that matter into motion, he established certain laws of motion ... And, to descend from the greatest operations to the smallest, when a workman forms a clock, or other piece of mechanism, he establishes, at his own pleasure, certain arbitrary laws for its direction ...'25 A combination of mechanical analogies and aesthetic values, like sym- metry and balance, all under a rule of reason, reflected the spirit of the Georgian constitution. The same spirit served to evaluate public law and constitutional principles, and so the Age of Reason considered Blackstone's 'fundamentals of government' to be the same as 'the rational principles of government.'26 The dissentient peers in 1763 had already called the 'funda- mental principles of the constitution,' principles that had preserved 'the balance of the constitution.'27 Also, this 'free constitution' had worked to curb 'the executive power,' for 'the enormous weight of prerogative, if left to itself, (as in arbitrary governments it is) spreads havoc and destruction among all the inferior movements; but, when balanced and regulated (as with us) by its proper counterpoise, timely and judiciously applied, its operations are then equable and certain, it invigorates the whole machine ...' Moreover, the king and the two houses of parliament 'form a mutual check upon each other,' Blackstone had found, and 'like three distinct powers in mechanics they jointly impel the machine of government in a direction different from what either, acting by itself, would have done.'28 Despite such mechanomorphic analogies, the spirit of this Georgian constitution still had a highly hallucinatory quality. Men made of it what they wished, and Sir James Eyre, recorder of London in 1763, exalted this spirit above statute law itself. As counsel for Wilkes, Eyre had raised 'the general question' of using a general warrant 'upon a bare suspicion of libel' and of the right to 'force persons' houses, break open their locks, seize their papers, etc.' With a high pitch of eloquence in behalf of the subjects' rights (and in behalf of the opposition to the Grenville ministry) the Recorder declared: A strange question to be agitated in these days, when the constitution is so well 24. 1 Commentaries, supra note 13, at 157-58 (ch. 2, sec. ii). 25.

Nothing can be more unjust in itself, than that the proof of a man's guilt shall be extracted from his own bosom. No legal authority in the present case to justify the action. No precedents, no legal determination, not an act of parliament itself, is sufficient to warrant any pro- ceeding contrary to the spirit of the constitution.29 Men of law and of politics were coming more and more to use the spirit of the constitution as a liaison between law, morality, and ethics. For them, the spirit was a convenient concept with which to tie together rules of politics and rules of law, and above all, the principles of constitutional governance. Good form in politics, a sense of fitness, came from good form in games. To illustrate a point in constitutional law vividly, men in court and parliament in the twentieth century often use gamenomorphic meta- phors. Politicians resort to the rules and codes of various sports to explain the working of constitutional governance, and a minister or member of parliament has commonly drawn an analogy to cricket, crew, or football to make a point in constitutional debate. The Duke of Devonshire explained by direct analogy to cricket why the cabinet had asked Queen Victoria for a dissolution of parliament and a general election in 1900: 'we all know very well that the captain of a cricketing eleven, when he wins the toss, puts his own side in, or his adversaries, as he thinks most favourable to his prospects of winning.'30 L. S. Amery, a retired cabinet minister, wrote glowingly in 1946 of 'the great game of politics,' 'with its "Routs and dis- comfitures, rushes, and rallies," its "Fights for the fearless and goals for the eager."' He went on to speak of the 'team of ministers' with their 'sup- porters,' of 'a governing team' and the 'alternative team,' the opposition. For Amery, the prime minister was the 'captain' and 'the man at the helm'; and he made of parliament a whole fleet of crews and captains. Election was for him a choosing up of sides, and to change the government and the cabinet was to 'convert the leading poachers into the "Crown's" gamekeepers.'31 Academic authors, too, use sports analogies. Jennings resorted to 'the rowing metaphor' in 1941, and in 1950 he described the 'attractive prizes' in both games and politics. He told how those who opposed political parties and the party system were constantly urging 'statesmen to "pull together," and not to have bow side cry "forward," while stroke side cries "back!"' He rebuked such critics saying, 'there is no agreement as to who shall be cox. One cannot expect either side to pull with a will if cox announces his intention of steering the boat over the weir.' When Jennings came to assess the voting habits of Britain's social classes, he devised a games taxonomy: 'those who play golf vote Conservative, most of those who support the local 29. 19 State Trials, supra note 17, at 1154-5. 30.

When they wish to be understood, they use the language and the ideas of the world of sport, and one philo- sopher has called public law simply the rules of the game. In 1953 Weldon used with telling effect analogies between politics and games, and in so doing he caught the full flavour of the constitution's spirit. To the remark, '"even if it is the law, I don't see why I should obey it,"' his answer was, '"Well, this is Great Britain, isn't it?"' Then he proceeded to translate this legal situation into the terms of cricket: '"Why should I obey the umpire? What right has he to give me out?" One can answer only by expounding the rules of cricket, the position of the M.C.C. [Marylebone Cricket Club], and so on. Beyond that there is nothing to be done except to say "This is a game of cricket, isn't it?"' In order to explain the meaning of the terms - authority, rights, and the rule of law - this Oxford philosopher converted laws of society into rules of the game; and he noted that they were neither sacrosanct nor infallible, simply necessary and practical. 'People do play games in accordance with rules (how else could they play them?)' How- ever, Weldon did admit 'important differences between politics and games,' and yet he concluded that 'the function of rules in both of them is the same.' His lucid exposition of the rule of law may seem simplistic when compared to the recondite reasoning and labyrinthine analyses of jurisprudentialists, and yet it is clear and carries conviction: 'Strictly speaking there is nothing difficult or impressive about "the Rule of Law." It is merely a convenient way of referring to the fact that associations have rules and unless those rules are pretty generally kept and enforced the association breaks down and the activity which it was designed to promote becomes impracticable. We no longer have a game of football but a general melhe ...,' After all, Blackstone had made law and rule synonymous when he defined municipal law as ' "a rule of civil conduct"'; and today ' "Cricket is played under the Laws of Cricket." '34 Another Oxford legal philosopher, Hart, also resorted to the metaphor of games in his erudite analysis, The Concept of Law. He, too, made rules and laws synonymous: 'whatever the rules are, whether they are those of games, like chess or cricket, or moral or legal rules ...' He believed that 'the scorer's rulings are, though final, not infallible,' and, he contended, 'the same is true in law.' He went on to elaborate this analogy and to explain that a game may continue even though the scorer (the umpire) errs, and some of his decisions may be clearly wrong. However, Hart concluded, such erring cannot go on forever, for 32. Jennings, The British Constitution (3rd ed., Cambridge, 1950) 31, 69, 44. 33.

[A tolerance of] isolated or exceptional official aberrations ... does not mean that the game of cricket or baseball is no longer being played ... if these aberrations are frequent, ... there must come a point when ... the game has changed. It is no longer cricket or baseball but 'scorer's discretion.'35 Under the towers of both Oxford and Westminster Palace, the use of gamenomorphic metaphors has continued. In the 1953 debate over the Royal Titles Bill Mr Beresford Craddock (Spelthorne), Conservative, spoke patriotically and eloquently about the 'British Commonwealth.' For Crad- dock, and he respectfully submitted it, 'the time has come to reconsider our whole attitude to the rules of the British Commonwealth club'; and he urged that this be done 'at the next Commonwealth conference, after the coronation.' There and then, he hoped, men would review 'the British way of life,' one that 'every Commonwealth country enjoys,' and he succinctly defined this mode in terms that illuminate the spirit of the constitution: 'What does the "British way of life" mean? Briefly summarized, it is: fair play, the rule of law, and order. That has been extended to all countries: India, Pakistan, Burma, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and, do not let us be afraid to say it, in a large measure to the United States of America.' Rules and laws, along with the rule of law, there were to be. If a member of this club did not like the rules, or was unwilling to observe them, then Craddock concluded, 'indeed, if any country does not wish to accept the rules I submit that we might be better without that country. (HON. MEMBERS: "No.") 31 Several countries of the Common- wealth took Craddock's hint, they acted accordingly, and so upset the balance among the British nations. The concept of balance, in constitutional contexts, may be tracked back to Lord Halifax and his Trimmer, 1685, where he recognized the 'blessed constitution.' Also, it has been the most constant value ever since, and constitutionalists, like Denning, Hart, Heuston, and MacDermott writing in the 1950s, assumed balance to be the quintessence of the constitution's spirit. Fairness, too, has had a long pedigree, and reasonableness antedates by several centuries the Age of Reason. The fair, the reasonable, and the balanced have been the most stable components of this fickle spirit, and they have become words of art in the interplay of politics and constitu- tionalism. Lord Denning in 1949 believed that Britain had successfully 'balanced conflicting interests' in regard to the police's powers of arrest. He attributed this to the recruitment of professional police from 'young men of excellent character, from good homes, usually of sturdy country stock, who, without knowing it, have born in them a sense of fair play and calmness in emergency, and, withal, a respect for law and order.'37 Not long after, in 35.

This lord chief justice also maintained that 'there remains a remarkably wide and firm unanimity as to what is fair and just and good' - qualities that he attributed to the constitution's spirit. Pre- war privilege, he felt, had been offset by 'the slogan "fair shares all around,"' and this was what had made effective the world war i rationing system. The law should, he declared, 'protect the public interest,' but it should do so 'with a fair regard for the other interests involved.'38 Even the king deserved a fair deal, George v had felt when he wrote to Asquith in 1913: 'Will it be wise, will it be fair to the sovereign as head of the army ...'39 So recently as the debates over the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill, 1968, members of both Lords and Commons often used the word, 'fair,' in one phrase after another, to show their contempt for this allegedly unfair legislation. Over a dozen times lords and commoners spoke of 'a fair and balanced policy,' and Mr Callaghan extolled 'the instinctive sense of fair play of the British people' ... 'What is fair for one is fair for the other,' Sir C. Mott-Radclyffe responded, and then he added, 'do not let us have too much one-sided cant on this score.' Mr Nott pointed out 'the essential characteristics of the British nation, fair play, fair mindedness and good neighbourliness,' while in the House of Lords, 'fair' was bandied about even more freely as a criterion for the Bill's appraisal.40 Lord Brooke of Cumnor was for seeing that the Asians 'should all have fair opportunity in this land of ours,' and he went on to quote from the Home Secretary's statement in another place, 'in fairness to the people of this country and in the interests of equitable treatment for the citizens of the Commonwealth.' Lord Byers held it to be 'our duty to ensure that the laws we pass are fair to individual men and women ... and can be understood by them to be fair'; Lord Gridley might ask, 'Is this fair to our Asian friends?' and answer 'I submit that it is not'; and many another peer showed 'a desire to be fair' to either the Asians or the Britons. An epitome of fairness, in fact of the spirit of the constitution, was the Marquess of Hertford's summation of 'certain basic virtues': 'There are certain concepts, certain words which are still connected in people's minds with the parliament at Westminster - such words as justice and fair play and honour, such old-fashioned ideas as keeping to one's pledged word, even when it is inconvenient to do so, or providing help for one's fellow subjects when they are in trouble far away.'41 Such old- fashioned sentimentality may reek of Victoria's reign, and yet it was current in both houses on 28 and 29 February 1968. Moreover, this moralism is 38. MacDermott, Protection from Power (1957), at 24, 4, 8, 119, 185. 39. Nicolson, King George the Fifth (London, 1952), at 226. 40. Parl.

Mr Callaghan's repeated plea for 'a fair and balanced policy' was an appeal to reason, and also to the members' sense of the reasonable.42 Reasonable appears in the judicial context with the frequency that fair does in the parliamentary. The judges, after all, are supposed to be the professional reasoners, the experts whose life and energy are devoted to doing justice, righting wrongs, and to defending the weak against the strong - the single subject against the government. Their task is to protect the dissenter from tyranny by the majority and from the state or society (the Establishment) itself. As umpires and referees in the game of living with one's fellow men, the independence of the judiciary, impartial adjudication, and the judges' tenure for good behaviour are the means by which the courts maintain the attitudes and apply the values that make up the spirit of the constitution. Reasonable is an adjective that many a judge has used to test the validity and rightness of causes, grounds, actions, care, and pre- cautions. The word itself means 'sensible, sane' and 'agreeable to reason; not irrational, absurd, or ridiculous,' and judges and law-makers have used it in just this sense.43 'Fair and reasonable' are the values that MacDermott cj recommended as a test to determine whether a dispute should be treated 'as judicial rather than administrative.' He cited nineteenth-century cases where courts had 'emphasized the master's duty to take reasonable pre- cautions,' '"the duty of taking reasonable care,"' and from a 1951 prece- dent, 'this test of a lack of reasonable care, or negligence.' He himself used 'the concept of reasonableness' to decide the applicability of what might be considered 'reasonably necessary' and 'reasonably required.'44" Lord Den- ning, too, applied the notions of the reasonable and the unreasonable. Scattered through his writings are words and phrases like 'a reasonable meaning,' 'reasonable cares,' 'reasonably,' 'reasonable cause,' 'reasonable grounds,' 'the reasonableness of the charge,' and 'the reasonableness of his action.'45 Back in 1921, Sargant j agreed 'with James, L.J., that this doc- trine ought to be reasonably, and not unreasonably, understood and applied.' In a distinguished dissenting opinion in 1942, Lord Atkin analyzed the meaning of 'reasonable cause' and thereby established its validity. He con- cluded that a '"reasonable cause" for an action or a belief is just as much a positive fact capable of determination by a third party as is a broken ankle or a legal right.'46 This doctrine of the reasonable also appears, not un- expectedly, in Indian law. There, any legislative restrictions upon the In- 42. Parl. Debates (Commons), 5th ser., vol. 759 (1968), 1242, 1258. 43. OED, vIII, sub, reasonable (defs. 2, 4). 44.

C. Setalvad, wrote in 1960, 'reasonable and imposed in the interests of the general public.' Indian courts were to apply 'the test of reasonableness ... and to each in- dividual statute impugned' for, Setalvad stated, 'no abstract standard or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases.' By June, 1969, the spirit of the constitution had so imbued the British Trade Union Congress that it assumed the responsibility to decide whether a wild-cat strike that violated a bargaining agreement was or was not 'reasonable.' In fact, the TUCe promised 'to "order" strikers back to work if their action was unreasonable.'47 Moreover, the concept of the unreasonable has enjoyed a perhaps greater precision than that of the reasonable, while most precise of all has been the delightful double negative, the not unreasonable. 'The unreasonableness of one or the other' to a marriage, Lord Denning held in Dunn v Dunn in 1949, justified separation; and 'then the party who has produced the separa- tion by reason of his or her unreasonable behaviour is guilty of desertion.' To act unreasonably is deemed to be against the spirit of the common law and also against that of the constitution. Unreasonable practices derived from the law's unaltered continuity and sanctioned by precedent and tradi- tion, have at times required pious frauds to render justice and to bring old law and new facts into a conformity with the current understanding of the reasonable. When stealing anything worth more than forty shillings was still punishable by death, a jury found that a ?5 bank-note was worth only thirty-nine shillings- so unreasonable had the inflation of the pound, and perhaps the humanitarian movement, made the statutory penalty. When the judiciary after world war nr wanted to restore reasonability to statute law, they had to override Baron Parke's golden rule that statutes should be 'interpreted according to the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words.' Against the letter of the law, Lord Denning set its spirit, and in 1953 he admonished those judges who simply 'fold their hands and blame the legislature, when really they ought to set to work and give the words a reasonable meaning' - to replace the unreasonable one inherited from the past.4" To decide a suit on 'a technical defect' that ran against equity, Lord Normand said in 1951 before the House of Lords, '"would be to stretch the precedents beyond reason and to pass from reality into formalism and make-believe." ' However, the world of make-believe, the myths that men have made, has had its influence, too, upon the spirit of the constitution. Lord Addison's confident belief in the force and effect of the fair and the reasonable as deterrants to prevent members of the government from overstepping the lines of proper political conduct was one. This noble viscount believed that 47. M. C. Setalvad, The Common Law in India (London, 1960), at 216, 217; The New York Times, 22 June 1969 (News of the Week Section), 5. 48.

Is then Britain's unwritten constitution really anything more than the limits to what one can get away with in the governance of Britain? And do not the prevailing meanings given to the unfair, the unreasonable, and the unbalanced truly afford a deeper perspection into the constitution's spirit? In the United States, too, these same values have currency. So recently as February 1970 Lyndon B. Johnson took them for granted when he stated, 'I was desperately trying to show that I was reasonable, that our country would prefer to talk rather than fight ... No one that sits in the chair of the President wants to be regarded as an unreasonable, unfair, unjust person who likes to wage war.'49 However, the dominant value that has determined the form and structure of the constitution's spirit, it would seem, has been balance. At one time, late in the eighteenth century, 'the king's little finger' (now the prime minister's) might tip the beam of the balance; and at another, parliament's preponderance of power would right it again. However, the goal of constitu- tional action has been to strike a fair and equitable balance between two coordinates. In 1910 during the debates over reforming the House of Lords, the peers resolved 'that a strong and efficient second chamber ... is necessary to the well-being of the state and to the balance of parliament.'50 Some- times statesmen have balanced the kingdom and the crown, the governed and their governors, or the several branches or parts of the government; at others the values and qualities of the constitutional ethic. Moreover, India's constitution, too, reflects the quintessential ingredient of balance, and Setalvad, in 1960, reached the ultimate conclusion, that 'the tradition' of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence was 'for the judges to regard themselves as im- partial interpreters, holding the balance even between the claims on the one hand of the general government and on the other of the regional govern- ments and between the citizen and the legislature or the executive.' To achieve this happy state would require 'the independence and impartiality of the judiciary' in order to balance right against wrong, obligation against immunity, and one social or economic interest over against the whole com- munity. By 1967, Uwe Kitzinger went so far as to identify balance with sovereignty itself: if we have made the subjects themselves in large part the quasi-sovereign, if we have invented the twin but contradictory notions of democracy and of liberty, 49.

That is the internal aspect of sove- reignty.51 In the idea of balance, many men, conservative and liberal alike, found the highest sanction of their beliefs in British constitutionalism. L. S. Amery, more than once a Tory minister, believed in 1946 that balance was the key to both the constitution and its spirit. He followed Burke in the notion that 'our constitution has throughout conformed to that principle of balance between initiative and control.' This led him to balance 'responsible leader- ship by government with responsible criticism in parliament' and to con- sider this equilibrium to be 'the essence of our constitution.'52 The balance was to be a 'fair and just' one, 'proper' and 'true,' and so for many it be- came an aesthetic or ethical value more than a mechanical principle. To preserve the individual's freedom, Lord Denning asserted in 1949, 'the task is one of getting the right balance.' To bring the welfare state under the rule of law, this judge first tried to balance 'the freedom of the individual ... with his duty'; and then because 'freedoms were so much abused' ... 'in our time they have been counterbalanced by the duty to use one's property and powers for the good of society as a whole.' His solution was to have the judges 'hold the balance' between 'social security' and 'individual freedom.' To attain this goal, Denning prescribed 'the influence of religion' upon the law and a return to 'the faith of our fathers' for, he urged, 'true Christianity should try to strike a correct balance between the individual and the society of which he forms part.' When Denning lectured on The Spirit of the Constitution in 1953, he considered that 'the peculiar genius of the British constitution lies in a third instinct, which is a practical instinct leading us to balance rights with duties, and powers with safeguards, so that neither rights nor powers shall be exceeded or abused.'53 Conservatives, too, believed in balance, and Lord Salisbury explained in 1950 that liberty was a quality to be balanced with authority. In debating the power of the cabinet, he contended 'What seems to me vital is that the authority both of the House of Commons and of the House of Lords should be maintained vis-a-vis the Cabinet and the Executive machine, if a balance of liberty and authority, which is the basis of ordered freedom, is to survive.' The same noble marquess in the same speech balanced 'the welfare of the community as a whole' with the 'rights of the individual citizens,' for, he said, 'if the proper balance is disturbed and too much license is given to individual citizens at the expense of the community, the ultimate result will be anarchy.' Furthermore, in 1950, 'the balance in this 51. Setalvad, supra note 47, at 202, 42; Uwe Kitzinger, 'The Realities of Sovereignty' (1967) 77, The Listener, at 347 (16 March). 52.

For him, what had maintained 'a pretty effective balance between anarchy and despotism' and had produced 'that system of ordered freedom which I sup- pose is our greatest contribution to the world' was 'the elaborate system of checks and counter-checks.'54 Lord MacDermott expressed the same desire to balance liberty and authority when he explained, in 1957, 'The imme- diate objective must be to see that the law maintains an effective control of the executive and that it does so in a manner calculated to keep a fair balance between the power of the state and the liberties of the subject; the sort of balance that will promote good administration and yet preserve the essential freedoms; the balance that demands a process of patient and perpetual adjustment; the balance that the art of democratic government must go on achieving if it is to survive.'55 But what is it that determines this 'fair balance'? One political scientist, Harrison, argued that 'the writings of academic constitutional experts do not have sufficient weight in themselves to maintain a balance in our system' of government; but, he believed, 'the general public has avoided extremes and exaggerations; and in this way the poise of our system has been maintained.'56 There still remains, however, the question, what dissuaded the 'general public,' and their leaders, too, from tilting the beam of the scales in a violent manner? To answer, 'the spirit of the constitution,' is simply to argue in a circle for balance is currently the central component of that spirit. What deter- mines a true and proper balance is the sense of fitness that prevails during any given time; and, paradoxically, the spirit of the constitution is one, but not the only one, of the factors that determine what is fit. Fitness at any given moment would seem to mean what the queen, the prime minister, members of the cabinet and other ministers, parliamentarians, judges, and justices calculate to be the momentary mood of the community towards public morality. When Profumo fell in 1963, probably neither the risk to security nor his sexual sport decided his fate; what did do so was un- doubtedly his deception of the House of Commons. His lying, indirect or implicit though it may have been, violated his fellow members' sense of fitness. They demanded his dismissal, and 'the House of Commons held him to have been guilty of contempt of the House.'"' Keeping faith, holding to promises and agreements in accordance with the contractual principle of British constitutionalism, and not breaking one's word have done much to identify the morality of politics with the spirit of the constitution. In the 1968 Commonwealth Immigrants Bill debates, there rolled off the tongues of lords and commoners alike the words, 'pledge,' 'promise,' and 'bond,' 54. Parl.

For peers, too, the purpose of the bill and its substance violated their sense of the fit and proper. For Lord Brockway, the bill itself tipped 'the balance on the side of those who are British and white.' Lord Foot shared this view, and he was 'unwilling to argue this matter on a basis of balance of convenience and advantage. It seems to me to be pretty squalid that we should be discussing the vested rights of British subjects and the removal of those rights as a matter of convenience. If we have to discuss it, however, is it necessarily true that the balance is in favour of the Bill? Put on the credit side of the balance sheet, if you will, the immediate ad- vantages ...'8 An ability to balance long-term principle against immediate advantage and short-term gain marks the British genius for constitutional governance. The supreme paradox in the genesis of British constitutionalism, and per- haps the grand conclusion, too, is the art of balancing principle and expediency. In the course of centuries, jurists and parliamentarians trans- formed expediency from a rule of politics into a constitutional principle. Then they poised it, as convenience, necessity, or timeliness might require, with another of the fundamental constitutional principles and so made of balance the paramount component of the constitution's spirit, perhaps of the nonexistent constitution itself. In actual practice, both judges and politicians have used expediency to co-ordinate politics and public law. Once expediency has become one of '"the settled convictions of the com- munity,"' then, it is said, jurists may draw therefrom the working rules S"immanent therein." " Thus expediency has become a co-ordinate sanc- tion by which to justify those exceptions to the established principles that have enabled them, when compromised, to survive. Moreover, it contains that modicum of hypocrisy so essential to preserve, over the long run, the integrity of tenets whose application on a particular occasion might cause embarrassment, perhaps disaster. By seasoning justice with expediency as well as mercy, British judges, statesmen, and administrators have tempered the rigour of constitutional law and have maintained the balance in govern- ance that the spirit of the constitution demands. This sense of balance has pervaded written constitutions, too, like the 1787 constitution of the United States and the Indian one of 1950. A decade later, Setalvad described the method of amendment of the latter as one that 'strikes a just balance between flexibility and rigidity.' India had followed Britain in attempting 'to keep the balance between private rights 58. Parl.

Her constitution's 'seven freedoms' once again repeat the eternal antithesis between personal liberty and 'the interests of the general public.' To resolve this dualism, Setalvad invoked the sanction of expediency and quoted Blackstone as authority: 'civil liberty ... is no other than natural liberty so far restrained by human laws (and no further) as is necessary and expedient for the general advantage of the public.' In Pakistan, Islamic law also balances expediency with principle. There, Muslim jurists have accepted, with more frankness and less embarrassment than have the British, the rule that 'necessity renders the forbidden permis- sible.' 'All the Qur'an and the Sunnah have prohibited,' one maxim states, 'becomes permissible whenever a pressing necessity arises'; and the Qur'an itself allows: ' "but he who is driven by necessity, neither craving nor trans- gressing, it is not sin for him." '60 Here, religion and morality enter in with expediency to balance the letter of the law and to give substance to the spirit of the constitution. In Britain, however, the moods and attitudes that form the spirit of the constitution, and with it the prevailing political morality, often find their expression in the double negative. Late Victorian constitutionalists and lawyers liked to believe and to assert that the individual subject was free to do anything that was 'not unlawful.' Similarly, in political practice the double negative comes close to defining, for the British mind, the meaning of constitutional as that which is not unconstitutional. Thus the unfair, the unreasonable acts, deeds, and ideas that might unbalance the unwritten constitution may serve to delimit, from beyond the border, the boundaries of the constitutional playing fields. The spirit of the constitution, too, also performs on occasion a negative, or preventative purpose - to estop one's opponent from speaking or acting in a way that one may get away with calling 'unconstitutional.' Subject to constant though often imperceptible change, that spirit also has preserved, paradoxically, constitutional con- tinuity. Despite Britain's 'slow revolution' that Maitland said in 1895 was 'accomplishing itself' 'under the cover of the crown,' and despite the changes that the welfare state, 1945-70, has wrought, Lord Denning believed in 1953 that 'the spirit of the constitution remains the same.' This accomplish- ment he accredited to those judges who had sat in Westminster Hall for over seven centuries, since the days of Henry n, because, he explained, 'the principles laid down by them have sunk deep into the mind of the nation and have been more powerful than anything else in creating the spirit of the British constitution.'6' Perhaps so. What is certain, however, is the derivation of modern Britain's fundamental constitutional principles from their mediaeval prototypes. Judges and parliamentarians, and kings, too, 60.

To say that continuity and change explain their genesis and their transformation is trite. Yet it happens to be true. Continuity in the spirit of the constitution has depended upon 'a remark- ably wide and firm unanimity as to what is fair and just and good,' and it also accounts for the sacrosanctity of these attributes. Such unanimity, of course, is merely a synonym for agreement, good faith, full trust, and all the other variants on the contractual theme. Fidelity is, perhaps, the true quintessence of constitutionalism, certainly a sine qua non for its success and perdurance; and good faith is what the man in Anglo-Saxon England swore to his lord, and what King Edmund in 941 required each subject to swear to the king. Keeping faith (or not breaking faith, as parliamentarians urged in 1968) is another ingredient of the sense of fitness, one that derives from the principle of contract or engagement. The concept of balance, however, seems the controlling idea for it prevents the spirit of the constitu- tion from becoming only a formless, insubstantial, and ineffective effluence. Justice itself, for the jurisprudentialist like Hart, 'is traditionally thought of as maintaining or restoring a balance or proportion,' and balance, surely, has been for long the most constant of the constants within the constitution's spirit. Another political philosopher, Barker, also found balance to be essential for 'a just and proper system of parliamentary democracy.' Its success de- pended upon 'a spirit of balance and accommodation among the four factors' of government: the electorate, parliament, the cabinet, and party. On a more abstract plane, he found that 'the delicacy of the balance be- tween the two principles of differentiation and co-operation will serve to explain some of the difficulties of the system of government by discussion.' More recently, in 1965, Lord Butler resorted to a mechanical kind of balance to explain why a prime minister might not become a dictator. He admitted that today 'the prime minister has more power than he ever had before'; but he balanced this concession with, 'I believe the British constitu- tion always invents the power to counteract too much power.' Then in regard to getting rid of a prime minister, Lord Butler's argument became abstract: 'what we are discussing here is not so much personalities as the stresses, counter-stresses, checks and counter-balances of the British con- stitution.' So mechanized a constitution would hardly have a spirit. Instead, were every governor and every subject a fair-minded person imbued with what the first Queen Elizabeth called 'sweet reasonableness,' then the majority and the minorities, outside of parliament and within, might easily strike a fair balance and so maintain an equitable body politic- perhaps even a welfare state where none will commit the cardinal sin of 'taking an unfair advantage.' Here is one limit beyond which the government must not go; for when it takes 'an unfair advantage of its temporary majority,' then</page><page sequence="21">64 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL it allows, Jennings argued, 'the party in opposition to believe it to be fair and just for them to obstruct in any way they can.' In short, then, the bars are down, the rules off, and partisanry perverts the true meaning of the constitution's spirit. Normally, however, men of all parties agree upon the standards of political conduct, and they maintain, if not unanimity, at least an understanding on good form and a sense of the fit. The constitution itself, Viscount Cecil of Chelwood explained in 1950, 'is workable only because general understandings of reasonable fairness are accepted by all Parties.'62 Thus the positive values - the fair, the just, the good, and the moderate, the reasonable, the equitable, and more recently the equal - have given to the spirit of the constitution its continuity. Nevertheless, an ever-shifting sense of values and the differing emphases put upon them have enlivened the spirit of the constitution, have prevented its becoming a dead-letter, and have enabled it to change. Perhaps the genius of the human mind is its ability to retain old words, to fill them with fresh ideas, imperceptibly to alter their connotations, and so maintain their currency. That great historical generalizer, Macaulay, noted more than a century ago how 'the history of England is emphatically the history of progress ... the history of a constant movement of the public mind, of a constant change in the constitutions of a great society.' A century later, Lord Denning recognized that by 1953 Dicey's 'cardinal features of our constitution,' the sovereignty of parliament and the rule of law, no longer held their primacy for 'the emphasis has altogether changed.' So has that on Bagheot's caption, 'Cabinet Government,' for, ever since Winston Churchill became prime minister in 1940, men have used the more exact phrase, prime ministerial government. A succession of inner cabinets has occurred in both peace and war, from Churchill's 'Small War Cabinet,' to Harold Wilson's reorganized inner cabinet of May 1969, which maintained the prime minister's arbitrary command against the challenge of party rivals, Callaghan and Brown. This fluidity in Britain's constitutional ar- rangements has enjoyed the authority of what Lord Denning called 'a practical instinct' and King George v and Stanley Baldwin considered simply 'common sense.' In reply to Asquith's two papers on the Irish Home Rule Bill in September 1913, George v resorted to an emotional appeal: 'it seems inconceivable to me that British common sense will not ultimately find a solution to this terrible prospect of rebellion.' Two decades later, Stanley Baldwin also sought the sanction of 'the broad common sense of the man-in-the-street' for his so-called National Government. In February 1932 the new prime minister asked the House to support this government 'of the three parties,' and then he answered his own rhetorical questions with a 62.

Who can say what is constitutional in the conduct of a National Government? It is a precedent, an experiment, a new practice, to meet a new emergency, a new condition of things, and we have collective responsibility for the departure from col- lective action. Whatever some ardent politicians may think, it is approved by the broad common sense of the man-in-the-street. The success or failure of this experiment will depend on one thing only, and that is the spirit in which it is conducted ...'3 'Average understanding' or 'good sound practical sense,' such as these political streetwalkers habitually invoke, has served as a counterpoise by which to balance the soar of the constitution's spirit. To change the public mind requires an acceptance of criticism, opposition, and dissent in order to engender fresh ideas, attitudes, and moods, and to revamp old ideals and values. Likewise, there has prevailed a rule of law upheld by an independent and impartial judiciary composed of judges who have stepped outside the game of politics and onto a bench that constitutes the arbiter of governance. A yet deeper law, one that really rules the constitu- tion, is its spirit, or the public conscience, that point beyond which acts of governance begin to look ludicrous or intolerable. To choose any one of the ingredients of the constitution's spirit as pre-eminent may seem incautious; but for over two hundred years, now, balance has stood out as fixed and constant. The kind of balance that has been the guiding rule and controlling principle of constitutional governance is the just, the fair, and the reason- able. As the dominating value in the spirit of the constitution, balance has set the mood of British constitutionalism during the reigns of all six Georges and the last two queens. Its foremost function, in the context of modern history, has been to measure and decide the admissible degree of deviance from the letter of the law, from the fundamental principles of British con- stitutionalism, and from the spirit of the constitution. Balance is both an ingredient and a function of the constitution's spirit and has been the distinguishing trait of modern British constitutionalism. As a noun, balance has meant a state of equipoise among the institutions and principles of government; and as a verb, it has served to control and to restrict the main processes of governance. But just what does the spirit of the constitution balance? And how far off-balance may the government be thrown, and for how long may any deviation endure, without endangering the continuity of established practices and principles? There has been a continuity, Amery asserted, in 'the principle of balance between initiative and control.' Parliamentary control has been a counterbalance to the crown's lead, and members of each house have applied laws, customs, and 63. 1 Macaulay, Critical and Historical Essays Contributed to the Edinburgh Review (Trevelyan, ed.; London, 1890) 707; Denning, supra note 45, at 1, 3; 2 Churchill, The Second World War: Their Finest Hour (London, 1949), 3; Nicolson, King George the Fifth, 228; 1 Emden, Selected Speeches on the Constitution, 100, 101. British academics, too, have lauded common sense. To make government work, Sir Ivor Jennings considered, 'What is needed, however, is not so much knowledge as plain common sense': Jennings, supra note 62, at 6.</page><page sequence="23">66 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL procedures that they considered constitutional. Their application has served to balance parliament with the cabinet or ministry, and the people (or the electors) with their representatives at Westminster. These, the consenting element, have balanced king, prime minister, and party leader who have been for so many centuries, 'the starting-point and mainspring of action.'64 In turn, the dissenting element, the opposition with its criticism, has coun- terbalanced the consenting one. To maintain a balance among the principles and the parts of government remains for Britain a live and living problem, one whose solution requires that every particular balance be just and fair, reasonable and equal. To imbue men and institutions with these virtues is not easy and requires more than legislation and adjudication; perhaps even something more than morality and ethics. Lord Chief Justice MacDermott thought so in 1957 when he raised and answered questions about the com- ponents of the constitution's spirit: But what is the criterion of a just balance? And where is the assurance that the all-important word will hold its savour and continue to enshrine those standards of fairness and goodness and truth that it has gathered throughout our long history? ... On what then do we depend for an enduring just balance? On some- thing, surely, that is not law at all; on something that resides neither in institu- tions nor past achievements, but in the hearts of individual people, in the com- mon cognate, virtues of courage, kindliness and honesty, in the lustre of the spirit, in the faith and vision that nourishes and upholds all else. We are per- haps too shy about this ultimate rampart. Lawyers like to call the vision the Law of Nature, but I think they still more often mean the Law of God.65 Or, perhaps, the spirit of the constitution. 64.

The bishop of Southwell spoke in a similar vein in 1950 in his maiden speech in the House of Lords: '... the State is itself under the law, answerable to a higher law which no State made and which no State may presume to alter. Some jurists have called that the law of nature; some theologians have called it the law of God. But the whole philosophical tradition of Western Europe has taken for granted that the State has no unconditional prerogative; that it is answerable to a higher law.' Then the bishop noted, not without some alarm, 'the modem State tends more and more to claim that it is itself a source and creator of law, rather than its guardian and its interpreter. It seems to me that that is a most dangerous new doctrine which needs critical vigilance.' Parl. Debates (Lords), 5th ser., vol. 167 (1950), 354.</page></plain_text>
