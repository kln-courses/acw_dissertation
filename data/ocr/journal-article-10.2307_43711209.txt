<plain_text><page sequence="1">QUMRÂN AND THE GENIZA FRAGMENTS OF SIRACH* In 1896, S. Schechter, professor of Talmudic Hebrew at Cambridge University, examined a leaf of an old MS and immediately recognized it to be a portion of Sir in Hebrew. The leaf had been recovered from the Geniza of the Qaraite Synagogue in Old Cairo. Prior to Schechter's dis- covery, Sir was known in Hebrew through only a few generally inexact quotations in the rabbinical literature. The Greek and Syriac versions, from which all the other translations were made, had been the sources of our knowledge of the Book. Between 1896 and 1900, many more fragments of Sir in Hebrew were recovered from the vast materials found in the Cairo Geniza. These frag- ments fell into four distinct groups, generally called MSS A, B, C, and D, and were dated from the ninth to the twelfth centuries. In 1931, J. Marcus discovered a single leaf of a fifth MS of Sir in Hebrew. This was desig- nated MS E. It added 34 new distichs to the 1056 previously recovered. In 1958 and 1960, J. Schirmann discovered a few more leaves of MSS B and C. These new finds contained 81 distichs, of which only eight were not already represented in the earlier fragments. Hence, the total thus far recovered is 1098 distichs, slightly more than two-thirds of the Book, which in Greek contains 1616 distichs. The generally accepted view among scholars was that the text contained in the fragments, though disfigured by scribal errors as well as other corruptions and by the presence of glosses, is essentially genuine. In recent years, however, there has arisen a wave of skepticism on the part of some who think that the Cairo Hebrew was retranslated from Greek or Syriac. In this article we shall attempt to prove that the Cairo Geniza frag- ments of Sir were copied from exemplars which represent a text that ultimately goes back to the caves of Khirbet Qumrân. None of the argu- ments is in itself conclusive, but the convergence and sum of all the argu- ments seem to make this hypothesis more than probable. If the Cairo Hebrew fragments were based on a text that was at one time in the Essene library, they must be to that extent genuine, for it is inconceivable that one would defend a retroversion hypothesis for a text which comes from so early a date (68 A.D. at the very latest). * This article was adapted from a chapter of the writer's doctoral dissertation entitled A Text-Critical and Historical Study of the Hebrew Text of Sirach, sub- mitted to the Faculty of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences of The Catholic University of America. 245</page><page sequence="2">246 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 24 Qumran Cave II Fragments of Sirach Among the fragmentary texts of Cave II at Qumrân M. Baillet has identified two portions of the Hebrew original of Sir.1 According to private communications from Baillet and R. de Vaux to M. R. Lehmann,2 one part of the Cave II fragments contains the final letters of successive units from Sir 6, 20-31, in the same wording and stichometric arrangement as in MS B from the Cairo Geniza. This is conclusive proof that the Qumrân Sect had at least part of Sir in Hebrew, if not the complete Book; and that the stichometric writing of the Book antedates 68 A.D. and conse- quently was not introduced by the medieval scribe of MS B or of MS E which is likewise so written.3 It is more than probable, as we shall see in the following arguments, that the text of the MS(S) which the medieval scribe employed as the basis for MS B goes back ultimately to the caves of Qumrân. Discovery of MSS in a Cave near Jericho A question which comes to mind immediately and naturally is this : how did the medieval Jews come by a text that had a stichometric arrangement? In the rest of this article the writer will attempt to provide a satisfactory answer to that question. Some years ago J. Fiick came across a letter, published in 1901, that seemed to have some bearing on the sensational discoveries made at Khirbet Qumrân in 1947. He brought this letter to the attention of O. Eissfeldt who then wrote an article4 concerning the events narrated in the letter 1 Cf. "Le travail d'édition des fragments manuscrits de Qumrân. Communica- tion de M. Baillet," RB 63 (1956) 54; and J. T. Milik, Ten Years of Discovery in the Wilderness of Judaea , trans, by J.

Facsimiles of MSS A, C, and D are also included. MS E was published by J. Marcus; see n .72 below. Several other recently discovered leaves of MSS B and C were published, with facsimiles, by J. Schirmann, " Dap hādās mitt ôk se fer ben-Sírď ha-ibrî" Tarbis^ 27 (1957-1958) 440-443; and "Dappîm nôsepîm mittôk sēfer ' ben-Sírã Tarbis 29 (1959-1960) 125-134. In an astounding article entitled "The Original Hebrew of Ben Sira 12, 10-14," JBL 74 (1955) 93-95, H. L. Ginsberg makes many charges against the authenticity of the Cairo Hebrew text of Sir. One of these charges is that, if the fragments of Sir, which had been discovered in the "Wilderness of Judah," are pre-Arab (little information about the fragments was available at the time), "it is probable that . . . they will be found to be as unlike [the Cairo Hebrew of Sir] as imaginable" (p. 93). The Cave II Hebrew fragments of Sir that we have been discussing, are witnesses against Ginsberg's unfounded assumption. 4 "Der gegenwärtige Stand der Erforschung der in Palästina neu gefundenen hebräischen Handschriften," TLZ 74 (1949) 595-600.</page><page sequence="3">Geniza Fragments of Sirach 247 and the possible connection of these events with the Dead Sea Scrolls. The letter in question was written in Syriac by Timothy I (727/728- 823), 6 the Nestorian Patriarch of Seleucia, to Sergius, the Metropolitan of Elam. After Eissfeldťs article appeared, many other scholars took notice of this important letter.6 The letter itself is not dated, but R. S. Bidawid argues for a date in either 796 or 797.7 The following translation was made from the Syriac text published by O. Braun.8 After mentioning in detail the troubles he had undergone in having the Hexapla of the entire Old Testament copied,9 Timothy writes: We have learned from trustworthy Jews, who just recently had been instructed as converts to Christianity, that ten years ago books were found in a cave [literally, a mountain-house] in the vicinity of Jericho. Here is the incident as they reported it. The dog of a certain Arab who was hunting, climbed into a cave in pursuit of some animal and did not return. When the master went to look for the dog, he came upon a small hollow [literally, a small house] inside the rocks, and many books were in it. The hunter then went up to Jerusalem and informed the Jews about this matter. Consequently, a large number of them came (from Jerusalem) and discovered books of the Old Testament as well as others written in the Hebrew script. Since the one who reported this incident to me was well-versed in literary matters, I asked him about various texts of our New Testament which are supposed to be drawn 6 There is some discrepancy among scholars as to the dates of Timothy's birth and death. The most recent study - R. S. Bidawid, Les lettres du Patriarche nes - torien, Timothée I ( Studi e Testi 187) (Vatican City, 1956) 1. 5 - argues for the dates given above.

And he told me that there are such texts, and that they can be found in those books which have been discovered (in the cave). After I heard the account from this catechumen, I went to the trouble of asking others besides him, and I received the very same story without variation.10 The above incident has striking similarities with the events that took place at Khirbet Qumrân in 1947 : A shepherd, Mohammad ed-Di'b (Mohammed the Wolf), was looking for a goat that had wandered off among the rocky slopes of the cliff, but, being rather weary, he sat down in the shade of a hollow in the rock. To amuse himself, he threw a stone into a hole in the cliff-face in front of him. A sound of something breaking came from inside and he took to his heels in fright. But curiosity was stronger than fear, and the next day he returned to the spot with his cousin, Ahmad Mohammad. The two Bedouins wormed their way through the hole into the cave and found it to be a narrow cavern, its floor strewn with potsherds. At the back stood a row of eight unbroken jars with their lids still on. These were empty, however, all but one out of which they took three rolls, one large and two smaller ones.11 It is not unlikely, as de Vaux12 and Kahle13 suggest, and as the present writer hopes to prove below, that the cave found in about the year 800 was one of those discovered anew since 1947 at Qumrân. In fact, de Vaux even offers the conjecture that Cave XXIX is the cave spoken of in Timothy's letter. Cave XXIX contained fragments of 12 jars and 17 jar- lids, of which seven were intact and stored in a pile against the wall. This arrangement of the debris together with the complete absence of written fragments seems to point, in the opinion of de Vaux, to an ancient ransack- ing of the cave.14 As to the credibility of the events narrated by Timothy, we can safely say that there is no reason to doubt the good faith of the venerable Patriarch. He was convinced that the story he was telling was true.15 The famous Qaraite scholar, Ja'qùb al-Qirqisānī (flourished in the first half of the 10th century), in his Kitãb al- Anwar wcU-Marãqib ( The Book of Lights and Watch-Towers ), written in 937/938, 16 mentions some sig- 10 Ibid., 304 and 306. 11 Milik, Ten Years . . . , llf. 12 Art . cit., 419f. 13 Cairo Geniza, 16f. 14 "Exploration de la région de Qumrân," RB 60 (1953) 560.

One of them is the Alexandrian20 whose book is famous and (widely) known; it is the most important of the books of the Magarians. Next to it (in impor- tance) is a small booklet entitled "The Book of Yaddua," also a fine work. As for the rest of the Magarian books, most of them are of no value and resemble mere tales.21 In other passages of The Book of Lights . . . Qirqisânî also mentions the Magarians or "Cave People." For example, he writes : The Magarians fix the beginning of months by the appearance of the new [jíc] moon. They adduce certain reasons in support of this (method) ; we shall mention them when we come to the discourse on the beginning of months and its indications. It is said that there are among them some who think that laughter is unlawful. Their interpretations of some passages in the Scrip- tures are altogether improbable and resemble foolish talk. Daūd ibn Marwän 17 D. Barthélemy brought Qirqisànî's interesting comments to the attention of de Vaux; the latter then became the first to show the relevance of Qirqisànî's witness to the events narrated by Timothy; cf. de Vaux, "A propos des manuscrits . . . 421f.

W. Bacher, "Qirqisânï, the Karaite, and His Work on Jewish Sects," JQR 7 (1894-1895 ) 703, agrees with Harkavy in thinking that this is Philo. S. Poznanski, "Philon dans l'ancienne lit- térature judeo-arabe," Revue des Études Juives 50 (1905) 10-31, also defends this identification. But Nemoy, "Al-Qirqisànî's Account . . . ," 327, n.24, rejects the identification with Philo in these words : ". . . Philo wrote more than one book, and his works were hardly 'famous and widely known' among Arabic speaking Jews in Western Persia; we have nothing to show that an Arabic translation of any of Philo's works was ever made." De Vaux, "A propos des manuscrits . . . 425, also argues against the identification with Philo. 21 Translation by Nemoy, "Al-Qirqisänl's Account . . . ," 326f. ; cf. ibid., 327, n.26, for comments on "The Book of Yaddua."

The Maģarians are said to be opposed to this, i.e., they do not profess anthropomorphism; yet they also do not take these descriptions (of God) out of their literal meaning, but assert instead that these descriptions refer to one of the angels, namely to the one who created the world. This (opinion) is similar to the view of Benjamin al-Nahâwandî22 which we shall explain later.23 Near the end of his account of the Jewish sects, Qirqisânî writes : These are all the doctrines of the dissenters who appeared (among the Jews) down to the present time, according to the information which we have received. Some of these sects have disappeared, e.g., the Maģarians and the Sad- ducees. . . ,24 Later in The Book of Lights . . . Qirqisânî gives more information which he promised in one of the quotations above : (The Maģarians) think that God, may his praise be glorious, created all material beings perfect and entire in the first moments of creation, as, for example, Adam and Eve, and other animals. For He created each one complete in its body; so also plants, trees, and the like. He created the body of each of the two luminaries, namely, the sun and the moon, along with all the stars, according to the ultimate degree of their possible perfection. And (the Ma- ģarians) offer as proof that the moon was created perfect and entire the text: "As the moon remains forever . . ." [Ps 89, 38]. And so when the world was created perfect and complete, the moon also was created perfect at the moment when it was created. Moreover, they say that the Bible names the two lumi- naries at the moment of their creation, "the large ones" [Gn 1, 16]. This (creation) took place on a Wednesday, and there is no doubt that this was the first day of the month, and that they [the sun and the moon] were created at the limit of their magnitude, since He calls them the two large ones. When the moon is full, it is largest and greatest; and we know that when it is full, that day is the first day of the month.25 Another Jew, Hadassi by name, who lived in the twelfth century, also 22 See Nemoy, "Al-Qirqisànî's Account . . . 386f. for the details of Nahâwandî's teachings. 23 Ibid., 363f.

The first is Shahrastānī (1076-1153), the principal scholar of the history of religions in the Middle Ages.27 In the famous work, Kitãb al Milal wan-Nihal ( The Book of Religions and Sects), which was composed in 1127, 28 he writes: But one sect of the Maqâriba [vocalized muqâriba by Badrān] claims that God spoke to the prophets, may peace be upon them, through the agency of an angel whom He had elected and whom He had given precedence over all creatures and had appointed viceroy over them. They say: "Every description of God in the Torah and in the rest of the Books is an account (given) on the authority of this angel. For otherwise it would not be possible to describe God in any way at all." They also say : "Furthermore, he who addressed Moses, may peace be upon him, is that angel. And God the exalted One is too exalted to address in human fashion mortal man. . . And it is stated that when Arius [died 336 A.D.] says that the Messiah is God and is the most perfect one in the world, he takes this statement from the (Maqâriba) ; they preceded Arius by 400 years. They were men of asceticism and mortification.29 The second Moslem author is al-Bīrūnī (973-1050?), 30 "one of the greatest scholars of mediaeval Islam, and certainly the most original and profound."31 In his first great work, Atãr al-Bãkiya ( The Chronology of the Past), composed in about the year 1000, he writes : 'Abū-'īsā al-Warrāq [died about the end of the ninth century] reports in his Kitãb al-Maqãlãfi2 of a type of Jews, called the Magar iba [variant: Ma- 26 Poznanski, art. cit., 14; cf. also de Vaux, "A propos des manuscrits . . . ," 422. 27 B.

Poznanski, art. cit., 15f., and R. de Vaux, "A propos des manuscrits . . . ," 422. 80 The date of al-Bīrūnī' s death is usually fixed at 1048, but actually he must have died after 1050; for the details, cf.

This is the beginning of the new year. From (the full moon) are calculated days and months; and according to it, the feasts follow on a cycle. For God the exalted One created the two major luminaries on a Wednes- day. (The Maģāriba) likewise do not allow the Passover except on a Wednes- day, nor do they impose the obligations and customs thereof save upon one who dwells in the land of the Israelites.33 As is clear from simply reading the texts quoted above, Qirqisânï, Shahrastānī, and al-Bīrūnī are all referring to the same Jewish sect. The various orthographies of the sect's name can be easily accounted for on the basis of misreading the Arabic consonants in question. Qirqisânï's al - maģārīya is certainly the correct spelling, for as he explains, the "Cave People" were so called because their sacred books were found in a maģār, a cave. In Shahrastānī's maqãriba, the gain was incorrectly read as a qãf, and the yã as a bā: two mistakes that are not difficult to make, since medial gain and qãf are so alike in shape, and medial (and initial) yã and bã differ only in the diacritical marks. Al-Bīrūnī's maģāriba with its variant, maqãriba, is to be explained in like manner.34 Both Qirqisânï and Shahrastānī state explicitly that the sect of the "Cave People" existed in the pre- or early Christian era : Qirqisânï places the sect, as we noted above, after the Sadducees but before the Christians and states that it was extinct in his own time; Shahrastānī says that the sect preceded Arius by 400 years. Qirqisânï relates that the books of the sect were found in a cave. Could this statement be a reference to the discovery of books in a cave that Timothy speaks of? R. de Vaux,35 Rowley,36 and Kahle37 think it quite likely. And the present writer agrees. The fact that Qirqisânï makes no allusion to any biblical MSS that were found in the cave, whereas Timothy 33 Translated from the Arabic text found in C. E.

An English Version of the Arabic Text of the A thãr-ul-Bâkiya of Albirüni (London, 1879) 278; but since Sachau's translation is, in the opinion of the present writer, inconsistent in parts, it was decided to make a fresh translation from the Arabic. Poznanski, art cit., 16f., and R. de Vaux, "A propos des manuscrits . . . 423, give French trans- lations of this passage. 34 Poznanski, art. cit., 16, mentions that the fourth possibility, maqärtya, is also found in some Arabic writers. 35 "A propos des manuscrits . . . ," 423f. 36 Op. cit., 23ff. 37 Cairo Geniza, 24.</page><page sequence="9">Geniza Fragments of Sirach 253 was interested only in the biblical texts, is not hard to understand. The former writer discussed only the non-canonical texts for the evidence they afforded concerning the beliefs of the sect; the latter author was not concerned with the various Jewish sects and their literature, but with only biblical texts.38 That Qirqisânî and Timothy both refer to the same dis- covery of books in a cave, is probable also by reason of the fact that no reference to the sect of the "Cave People" prior to the time of Timothy has thus far been produced.39 The evidence adduced up to this point seems to warrant the following conclusions: (1) biblical as well as non-biblical MSS written in Hebrew were recovered about 800 A.D. from a cave in the vicinity of Jericho (Timothy) ; (2) the non-biblical texts belonged to a Jewish sect which indulged in fanciful interpretations of Sacred Scripture (Qirqisânî), and practiced a rigid asceticism (Shahrastānī) ; (3) the sect had its own peculiar calendar which fixed on a Wednesday the beginning of the new year and the celebration of the Passover (al-Bīrūnī) ; (4) the sect flour- ished about the beginning of the Christian era (Qirqisânî, Shahrastānī) ; (5) the sect was already extinct by 937 A.D. (Qirqisânî). A question which comes to mind quite naturally at this point is this: is there any connection between the MS find of about 800 A.D. and the Khirbet Qumrân discoveries dating from 1947? That there is such a connection is considered possible by Rowley,40 probable by R. de Vaux,41 and practically certain by Kahle.42 The present writer agrees with Kahle. The following analysis will, it is hoped, show the reasonableness of this view. The caves of Qumrân, only a few miles from Jericho, have produced innumerable fragments of biblical as well as non-biblical MSS written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. The cave Timothy speaks of yielded many MSS of biblical and non-biblical texts written in Hebrew. The non-biblical MSS of Qumrân belonged to the Essenes who lived a quasi-monastic life. In its exegesis this sect at times made fantastic ap- plications to contemporary history. This feature becomes obvious from a simple reading of the sect's commentaries on Na, Hb, Mi, and Ps 37. The non-biblical texts of Timothy's cave were said to belong to a Jewish sect whose "interpretation of some passages in the Scriptures are altogether 38 Cf. R. de Vaux, "A propos des manuscrits . . . 423i. ; Rowley, op. cit.f 23i. 39 Rowley, op. cit., 24. 40 Ibid., 22-29. 41 "A propos de manuscrits . . . 424fï. 42 Cairo Genisa, 16fř.</page><page sequence="10">254 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 24 improbable and resemble foolish talk" (Qirqisânî) ; the members of the sect were "men of asceticism and mortification,, (Shahrastānī). The problems of the Essene calendar are too involved43 to merit de- tailed treatment here, but from the study of competent scholars two features of this calendar are certain: (1) the new year began on Wednes- day;44 and (2) the Passover was celebrated also on a Wednesday.45 In the calendar of the "Cave People" sect the new year and the Passover also fell on a Wednesday (al-Bīrūnī). The Essenes flourished in the first two centuries before Christ and became extinct some time after the turn of the Christian era.46 The "Cave People" sect also prospered about the time of Christ (Qirqisânî, Shahras- tānī) and was extinct at least by the tenth century (Qirqisam). In the opinion of the writer it seems inconceivable that the similarities between the Essenes and the "Cave People" result from mere coincidence. True, there are some tenets of the "Cave People" - certain aspects of their angelology (see above) - that are not found in the Qumrân frag- ments thus far recovered. But the teachings in question became known to the medieval Jews from the MSS discovered in 800; hence, Qumrân texts expounding doctrines of a similar nature may never come to light, if the MSS of 800 were the only copies which contained those doctrines. Granting that the cave discovered about 800 A.D. is one of the caves at Khirbet Qumrân, and that the "Cave People" sect can plausibly be identified with the Essenes, the reader may rightly ask: what has all this to do with the authenticity of the Cairo text of Sir? The Jericho Cave and the Hebrew of Sirach It is the contention of the writer that the Geniza Hebrew of Sir came from the Jericho cave, for this text seems to have been virtually unknown in Jewish circles from shortly after the Synod of Jamnia in the last decade of the first century A.D., when the rabbis succeeded in suppressing the Book, till the ninth century, in the latter part of which Saadia Gaon em- ployed several quotations from Sir that correspond exactly to the Geniza 43 Cf.

If this text came from the Jericho (Qumrân) cave, then it must be authentic since it presumably antedates 68 A.D. By assuming that the Hebrew MSS of Sir - as well as many other fragments recovered from the Cairo Geniza - were copied from texts that came to light in 800 from the cave near Jericho, and that this cave had been used centuries earlier by the Essenes of Qumrân, we can reasonably and coherently account for a series of facts that seem to defy explanation otherwise : 1. Qumrân Cave II fragments of the Hebrew text of Sir, which we spoke of in a previous section, match the wording and stichometric ar- rangement found in MS B from the Geniza. 2. The text of portions of the Damascus Document, recovered from Qumrân Caves IV, V, and VI, is substantially identical with the A recen- sion of that document found in the Cairo Geniza. Moreover, fragments of an Aramaic Testament of Levi from Qumrân Caves I and IV give a text which is the same as that found in the Geniza MSS of that same Testament. 3. Saadia Gaon quotes 26 hemistichs of Sir in Hebrew; these quota- tions coincide virtually word for word with the text of the Cairo MSS. But most of the other rabbinical citations of Sir are quite free or but slight- ly resemble the Cairo text. 4. The confusion of waw and yod in the Geniza copies of the Damascus Document and the Hebrew MSS of Sir, cannot be explained on the basis of medieval palaeography which sharply distinguishes between these two letters. The confusion must have already existed in the exemplars of these texts. 5. Whether authentic or not, the short psalm between w. 12 and 13 of chap. 51 of Sir in Hebrew dates from pre-Christian times. We must examine in detail each of the last four items. The Damascus Document and the Testament of Levi The Jerusalem Jews who examined the texts recovered from the Jericho cave were largely from the sect or party of the Qaraites. Though this sect began in Babylonia a few years after the middle of the eighth century A.D., it soon won adherents in Jerusalem which before long became the spiritual center of the Qaraites.47 J. Mann, an authority on the sect, writes : "Ķaraism seems to have attained a commanding lead in Jerusalem in the second half of the 9th century."48 The logical explanation of this remarkable success seems to be: 47 Kahle, Cairo Geniza , 17. 48 Texts and Studies in Jewish History and Literature 2.

This material would appear to have been the MS scrolls brought to Jerusalem about the year 800 from the cave near Jericho.49 Now if the MSS found in 800 have as their source the Essene com- munity of Qumrân, we can plausibly account for the remarkable similari- ties that exist between the Qaraites and the Essenes. As Kahle reports,50 M. Zucker demonstrated the influence that the Damascus Document, two recensions of which ( A and B) were recovered from the Cairo Geniza,51 must have had on Daniel el-Qùmisï, a prominent Qaraite who flourished in Jerusalem in the middle of the ninth century. Indeed, the Damascus Document was so instrumental in the evolution of Qaraite doctrine that S. Zeitlin, evaluating the evidence in reverse, attributed the document to the Qaraites who, he claimed, wished to prove for the purpose of propa- ganda the antiquity of their sect.52 The pre-Christian dating of the Damascus Document is now, however, beyond question, thanks to the discovery of the Manual of Discipline, and especially to the identification of copies of the Damascus Document in Caves IV, V, and VI at Qumrân. The Qumrân MSS offer a text which is substantially identical with that of the A recension recovered from the Cairo Geniza, although there are some noteworthy additions.53 The oldest Qumrân copy (4 QDft) is to be dated between 75 and 50 B.C., according to Milik.54 Where did the medieval Qaraites obtain the Damascus Document, a text that must have remained unknown for some 700 years? The most likely source seems to be the cave spoken of by Timothy. And since the 49 Kahle, Cairo Geniza , 17. 50 Ibid., 18. 51 S.

Indeed, Kahle writes: The survival of [the Zadokite fragment and the Hebrew text of Sirach] in the time of the Mishna and Talmud has been a great problem, and we are un- doubtedly right in assuming that these texts of the Geniza were copies of manuscripts found in the cave near Jericho in the 8th century.55 Further evidence from Qumrân in support of the hypothesis that the text of the Sir fragments from Cairo was at one time in the Essene library, is furnished by fragments of an Aramaic Testament of Levi from Caves I and IV.50 As is well known, the Cairo Geniza has also produced some MSS of this Aramaic Testament ,57 which date from the eleventh century, possibly earlier.58 Now the text of the Qumrân copies of the Testament of Levi, which copies antedate 68 A.D.,59 is identical with that of the Geniza MSS.60 It seems likely, therefore, that the Hebrew text of Sir from the Geniza, like the text of the Cairo Testament of Levi, also was at Qumrân.

This date has been given in many studies of Saadia: cf., for example, H. Malter, Saadia Gaon : His Life and Works (Philadelphia, 1921) 25; A. E. Cowley, "Seadiah, Ben Joseph," Encyclopaedia Britannica 20 (Chicago, 1947) 239.

In 25 of these - Sir 3, 21-22 (4 hemistichs) ; 5, 5-6 (6) ; 6, 6-8 (6) ; 6, 13 (2) ; 11, 28c-d (2); 13, lid (1); 16, 17 (4) - his citations are practically identical with the text of MS A; only once - Sir 13, 11c - is the quotation not literal, but merely ad sensum. This fact is quite significant, for of the other rabbinical quotations of Sir only 19 hemistichs out of a total of 106 match the wording of the Geniza Hebrew, the other 87 hemistichs being very free or merely para- phrases that but slightly resemble the Cairo Hebrew.63 It seems highly probable, therefore, that most of the rabbis before Saadia did not possess an authentic text of Sir, but for their use of the Book had to rely upon oral tradition or upon badly transmitted florilegia, the reason being that the cave near Jericho had not yet been discovered. Now we must take into account the following considerations : 1. Saadia left Egypt, where he was born, about the year 915, or perhaps earlier, and lived for some time in Palestine. What he did there and precisely how long he stayed, we cannot be certain. But there is evidence that some of his works were written in Palestine, and that he remained there at least a few years.64 It is quite probable that during this period of his life, Saadia first came in personal contact with the Qaraites,65 whose center was, as we have seen above, in Jerusalem. It is not impossible that at this time Saadia also received a copy of the Hebrew text of Sir from the Jerusalem Qaraites who, as we can reasonably suppose, recovered the text from the Jericho (Qumrân) cave. 2. The existence of some Persian glosses in the margins of MS B (see the margins at Sir 32, 1 ; 35, 26 ; 40, 22 ; and 45, 9) points "to its having been written in Bagdad or Persia.,,ß6 Now in 928 the Exilarch David ben Zakkai, whose official seat was in Bagdad, appointed Saadia to the supreme scholastic office of gaon of the Academy in Sura (Babylonia), which is situated in southeastern Mesopotamia. Saadia held this position, except for a brief period of three years (see above), till his death in 942.67 Thus 62 Malter, op. cit., 269. 63 For the rabbinical quotations of Sir we have used the compilation which is found in A.

Saadia wrote his Sē per ha-gâlûy, of which only fragments exist, in a highly rhetorical style, divided it into verses, and vocalized and accentuated it after the manner of a biblical text.68 The Qaraites, among others, were shocked by the arrogance and irreverence evident in Saadia's imitation of the Sacred Text. Consequently, Saadia wrote another work to justify himself against the accusation of impiety leveled against him. He states that the division of his text into verses and the addition of vowel-points and accents, are merely aids to the reading and understanding of a Hebrew book. He then mentions several whom he considered post-biblical authors who did the very same thing, yet who were not censured; among these Sir is named.69 Hence, Saadia must have possessed a copy of at least a portion of Sir that was furnished with vowels and accents.70 4. Many verses in the Cairo MSS of Sir also have vowel-points and accents. See, for example, the facsimiles of 9, 3-4 (MS A) ; 10, 2 (MS A) ; 11, 6-8 (MS A) ; and 37, 3 (MS D). From the preceding observations as well as from his exact quotations of Sir, it seems perfectly reasonable to conclude that Saadia had before him a text of the Book which was basically the same as that of MS A from the Cairo Genizaģ The most plausible explanation as to why Saadia had a correct text of Sir, whereas the other rabbis generally did not, is that the venerable Gaon received a copy of the Sir text that had been recovered from the (Qumrân) cave near Jericho in about the year 800. Confusion of waw and yod In medieval Hebrew palaeography there is an unmistakable distinction between waw and yod. This fact becomes perfectly obvious from even a rapid examination of the excellent Oxford and Cambridge facsimiles71 of the Cairo MSS which date from the ninth to the twelfth centuries. Even the miserably poor facsimiles72 of the one leaf of MS E, dating from the ß8 Cf. S. Schechter, Saadyana: Genisa Fragments of Writings of R.

With the texts recovered from the Qumrân Caves, however, the situa- tion is otherwise. In many of these documents the shapes of waw and yod differ but slightly, if indeed at all. In describing waw and yod in the formal Hasmonaean script (150-ca. 30 B.C.) from Qumrân, F. M. Cross, one of the few authorities in Hebrew palaeography, writes: In the late Hasmonaean script, the curled head [of wow] becomes an angular hook, often shaded so that a triangular effect is given. The latter develop- ment of the head of waw parallels the development of yod so that the heads of waw and yod become virtually identical in some (but not all) scripts of the early Herodian period [30 B.C.-70 A.D.]. The ligaturing of waw and especially yod with the preceding letter becomes increasingly frequent in the late Has- monaean era, continuing on, of course, into the Herodian scripts.73 The yod regularly is attached by ligatures to the preceding letter; this creates a lengthened right leg in ligatured forms, and often the ligatured form influ- ences the independent form, so that yod and waw become easily confused, each having a fairly long right leg. In the scribe's mind, however, though often not reflected in his pen, the head or left leg (as the case may be) of yod extends farther to the left than in the case of waw.74 Now Schechter noted when he published the Damascus Document that "there is very little consistency in such letters as waw, yod . . . , the yod is sometimes so large as to be confused with a waw"75 And Rabin in his model edition of the Document confesses : I have not always been able to distinguish with confidence between yod and waw; it seems to me that the copyist often purposely wrote something in between the two because the manuscript from which he copied (as we know now from the Dead Sea Scrolls) did not distinguish between them at all, and he was doubtful which of the two was meant.76 The writer submits the following as instances of the phenomena that Rabin speaks of, and of actual misreadings of waw for yod or vice versa, xxxii , 16-xxxiv, 1) : The Fifth Manuscript and a Prosodie Version of Ben Sira ( Ecclesiasticus xxii , 22 -xxiii, 9) (Philadelphia, 1931), facing pp. 12 and 13.

But since ýs is a verb whose primitive first radical was waw, as the Arabic equivalent demonstrates, the niphal infinitive construct should restore the waw.

Plate V, 1. 15, khr bytw , which as Rabin correctly observes,77 should be read as khrbwtw. There is no need to multiply examples, of which there are many, for the few cited above supply enough evidence to justify the conclusion that the Vorlage of the medieval scribe was not clear in its distinction between waw and yod. How can we reasonably account for this? The best ex- planation, the writer submits, is that the text of the Vorlage in question came from the (Qumrân) Jericho cave. The Qumrân Cave VI fragments of the Damascus Document 78 provide striking confirmation for this hy- pothesis. In fragment 3, for example, compare the waw of hqwds (1. 4) with the yod of yšťl (1. 3) or of bryt (1. 5) ; the shapes of these two letters are virtually identical in the examples given. What can be said of waw and yod in the Vorlag e (w) of the Cairo MSS of Sir? In answer to that question the writer calls attention to the follow- ing illustrative examples of confusion between waw and yod that must have existed in the Vorlag e (n) of the Geniza fragments; for the con- venience of the reader, these examples are taken from the Oxford and Cambridge facsimiles,70 which, since they are not numbered, we shall refer to by citing the first and last verse contained in each. 77 Ibid., 21. 78 Published by Baillet, "Fragments du Document de Damas . . . plate II, fac- ing p. 512. 79 See note 3 for the reference.

MS B (40, 26c-41, 9), 1. 10 (41, 2c) reads: 'ys kwsl ynqs bkl (a man who stumbles will strike against everything), but the margin has instead 'yš kwsl wnwqs bkl (a man who stumbles and strikes against every- thing), a better reading for the context.

The Psalm between Sir 51, 12 and 13 Between w. 12 and 13 of chap. 51 of Sir in Hebrew, there is a short psalm - patterned after Ps 136 - the authenticity of which has been open to question,80 since, among other reasons, it is found in neither the Greek nor the Syriac version, nor in their daughter translations. But, as the note in the CCD translation correctly indicates: "Though not found in any versions, and therefore of doubtful authenticity, the litany seems from internal evidence to go back to the time of Sirach." In two adjoining distichs (the eighth and ninth) we read: Give thanks to him who makes a horn sprout forth for the house of David, For his mercy endures forever. Give thanks to him who chooses the sons of Sadoq to act as priests, For his mercy endures forever. The mention of a Davidic Messiah and of the "sons of Sadoq" argues for a pre-Christian date of at least these verses, and presumably of the entire psalm. 80 The authenticity of the psalm is upheld by Schechter in the Introduction to The Wisdom of Ben Sira: Portions of the Book Ecclesiasticus from Hebrew Manu- scripts in the Cairo GenÍ2ah Collection Presented to the University of Cambridge by the Editors, ed. by S.

As is well known, Messianism was an important theme in the Qumrân literature. The Damascus Document, for example, refers four times to the "Messiah of Aaron and Israel."83 And in the Manual of Discipline we find the phrase "until the coming of a/the prophet and the Messiahs of Aaron and Israël."84 From these and other passages it becomes clear that the men of Qumrân expected three Messianic persons : the Prophet, the Messiah of Aaron, and the Messiah of Israel.85 Our concern here is with the third one. Milik points out that the Messiah of Israel corresponds to the tra- ditional Messiah of Judah who would come forth from the royal Davidic line, "for in some texts from Cave IV he is called 'Shoot of Daviď (cf. Jer 23.5; 33.15; Za 3.8; 6.12) ,"86 As to the "sons of Sadoq," we know the lofty esteem they enjoyed from Sir 50, 1-21, in which the last great high priest of the Sadoqite line, Simon II (died about 200 B.C.),87 son of Johanan, receives generous praise. And in Sir 45, 24, we read (CCD translation) : Therefore on him [Phinees] again God conferred the right, in a covenant of friendship, to provide for the sanctuary, So that he and his descendants should possess the high priesthood forever. 81 The Hebrew (MS B) of this verse is fragmentary but can be reasonably re- constructed from the Greek and from A g 2, 23. 82 The CCD note on this verse reads : "This promise to Zorobabel, reversing the punishment of his grandfather (Jer 22, 24), is a continuation of the Messianic hope; cf. Za 6, 1 If." Cf. also R. T. Siebeneck, "The Messianism of Aggeus and Proto- Zacharias," CBQ 19 (1957) 317f.

Simon's successor to the high priesthood, Onias III, was strongly opposed to the policy of Hellenization imposed by Antiochus Epiphanes (175-163 B.C.). His brother, Jason, however, was not only willing, but did his best to hellenize Jewry. In the ensuing struggle for power Jason offered Antiochus a sum of money in return for recognition as high priest in place of his brother. Jason succeeded in obtaining the high priesthood, but the precedent of appealing to Antiochus for appointment to that office sounded the death knell for the Sadoqite line at the Jerusalem temple. In 152 B.C. the Hasmonaean Jonathan was awarded the high priesthood for his sup- port of Alexander Balas, the Syrian king, and in 140 B.C. the de jacto rights and privileges which Jonathan enjoyed became de iure rights for Simon, Jonathan's brother, and his house. Thus the high priesthood was irrevocably transferred from the Sadoqites to the Hasmonaeans.88 The Qumrân Community which was established at about this time con- tained a number of the ousted Sadoqite priests. These priests held posi- tions of honor and jurisdiction in the sect, as is clear from the Manual of Discipline : They [the members of the community] are to abide by the decisions of the sons of Zadok, the same being priests that still keep the Covenant, and of the majority of the community that stand firm in it. It is by the vote of such that all matters doctrinal, economic and judicial are to be determined.89 He [the man who seeks after inner vision] is to respect the distinctive rank accorded to the sons of Zadok and to the elect of any specific epoch by virtue of their spiritual attitudes, and to appraise them by that criterion, thus adher- ing to the will of God, as He has commanded.90 Now if Ben Sira himself did not compose the psalm between Sir 51, 12 and 13 - a position which the present writer favors because the psalm is not contained in any of the versions and does not seem to suit the context - then the words, "Give thanks to him who chooses the sons of Sadoq to act as priests," could quite plausibly have been written by a member of the Qumrân sect and placed, together with the rest of the psalm, where we find them in the Cairo text.91 For it appears inconceivable that a ss ibid., 97-107. 89 Translation by T. H. Gaster, The Dead Sea Scriptures (New York, 1957) 46. 90 Ibid., 59. 91 After the writer came to this conclusion, he was gratified to find that R. E. Brown, art. cit., 63, n.54, also allows this possibility. Pertinent to the discussion at hand are the words of J. Trinquet, "Les liens 'sadocites' de l'Écrit de Damas, des manuscrits de la Mer Morte et de l'Ecclésiastique," VT 1 (1951) 290: "Authentique ou inauthentique, ce psaume, par sa présence dans les fragments hébreux de l'Ec- clésiastique parait indiquer qu'au moins ceux-ci furent entre les mains des 'fils de Sadoq.' "</page><page sequence="22">266 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 24 person far removed from the turbulent events that marked the second century B.C. would write such words extolling the "sons of Sadoq" when the Sadoqite priesthood in Jerusalem had ceased to function by 152 B.C. If this hypothesis is correct, the Cairo text of Sir must have been copied from exemplars that were at one time in the (Qumrân) cave near Jericho. If, however, the psalm is authentic, we must try to account for its omission from the Greek version, which was made some time after 132 B.C., and the Syriac, which was composed before or during the fourth century A.D. The writer suggests that the psalm may have been expunged from most of the MSS of Sir in order to avoid embarrassing the Has- monaean high priests.92 But obviously at least one MS still had to contain the psalm: the MS on which the Cairo text is based. One group of persons who would not hesitate to embarrass the Hasmonaean priesthood would be, of course, the Qumrân sect. Hence, even in the supposition that the psalm is authentic, its preservation could conceivably be attributed to the men of Qumrân. If this is so, then here too the Jericho cave conveniently - and without too much difficulty - solves the problem as to how the Geniza MS came to include the psalm. Conclusions According to the more than probable hypothesis defended in this article, the history of the Hebrew text of Sir seems to go something like this : 1. During the first quarter of the second century B.C. Ben Sira com- poses his Book in Palestine. 2. Many copies of the Book are made and circulated. Some reach Alexandria where Ben Sira's grandson makes his Greek translation some time after 132 B.C. Others remain in the Holy Land where the members of the Qumrân sect, who emigrated to the wilderness of Judea, cherish the Book, probably because of its emphasis on the Sadoqite priesthood. 3. In the Synod of Jamnia at the end of the first century A.D. the rabbis suppress the Book, but a few copies keep in circulation. 4. At least one copy of the Hebrew text forms the basis of the Syriac version, which was composed before or during the fourth century A.D. 02 Schechter, The Wisdom of Ben Stra, 35, gives a similar explanation: "The reason for [the psalm's] omission by the Greek translator, who in this respect, as in so many others, was followed by his Syrian successor, is not hard to conjecture. Living at a time when the house of Zadok was already superseded by the Maccabean line, the grandson of [Ben Sira] recoiled from giving publicity to a hymn which claimed that the bny fdwq were specially selected for the priesthood." Cf. also Box-Oesterley, art . cit., 277.</page><page sequence="23">Geniza Fragments of Sirach 267 By this late date the Hebrew behind the Syriac translation seems to have been a recension different from that preserved in the Jericho (Qumrân) Cave. 5. The Hebrew text survives till the time of St. Jerome (died 420) who writes in his preface to the Books of Solomon : "Fertur et panaretos Jesu filii Sirach liber, et alius pseudepigraphos qui Sapientia Salomonis inscribitur. Quorum priorem Hebraicum reperi, non Ecclesiasticum, ut apud Latinos ; sed Parabolas praenotatum. . . ."93 6. By mid-fifth century A.D. it seems that the Hebrew text of Sir is finally quashed. Popular recollections of and favorite proverbs from the Book survive among the people and are often quoted by rabbinical authors. But such quotations, as we noted above, are often inexact, proving that the rabbis were citing from memory or from poorly transmitted florilegia. 7. At the end of the eighth century A.D. the Hebrew text of Sir is recovered from the Jericho cave that was found by an Arab hunter. This cave is one of those discovered anew at Khirbet Qumrân since 1947. 8. The Qaraites who receive the MSS of Sir from the Jericho cave have a high regard for the Book and make many copies of it. Perhaps, among other reasons, due to the poor preservation of some of the cave MSS and to the difficulty of reading the Qumrân script (e.g., waw and yod), some copyist (s) retranslate (s) from the Syriac version passages that were not contained in the cave fragments or that did not seem to make sense.94 This operation explains many of the doublets. 9. The Qaraites and other Jews - Saadia, for example - enjoy the use of the Hebrew Sir up to the twelfth century when the Rabbanites again succeed in suppressing the Book completely. Hence, since the Hebrew text disappears into the Genizas, Jewish authors from the Middle Ages to almost the end of the last century never again use it. 10. In 1896 the Geniza of the Qaraite Synagogue in Old Cairo yields ninth to twelfth century copies of portions of the original Hebrew of Sir. Alexander A. Di Lella, O.F.M. Holy Name College Washington, D.C . «3 PL 28, 1307fš 94 In a lengthy chapter of his dissertation, the writer has proved that there exists in the Geniza MSS of Sir undeniable evidence of partial retroversion from Syriac. This phenomenon, however, does not impugn the substantial authenticity of the Cairo Hebrew.</page></plain_text>
