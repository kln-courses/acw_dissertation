<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT SOS HOYUK, 1995 Second Preliminary Report By ANTONIO SAGONA, MUSTAFA ERKMEN, CLAUDIA SAGONA and IAN THOMAS Archaeological investigations this year at Sos Hoyiik, carried out by the University of Melbourne and Erzurum Museum, took place in the summer, between 2 June and 3 August.' The aims for the 1995 season included activities both on the mound and off-site. Among the former objectives, was the need to expose further the Medieval settlement on the summit of the mound, and the burnt building of the Hellenistic period in trenches LI 4 and L1 3. Excavation was also required in the lower northeast trenches to clarify the depositions of the late third to second millennium B.C. In addition to these largely horizontal operations, we commenced an independent vertical sounding in J14 to obtain a immediate guide to the sequence of Iron Age deposits. The intensive field survey of the site environs continued, as did the search for the obsidian source in the hilltops around Pasinler. A detailed palaeoecolog- ical study of the region was initiated this year. Information from promising pollen cores taken at various altitudes in the Kargapazari Daglari, the mountain range immediately to the north of the site, will no doubt complement the faunal and botanical data from the excavations. We also conducted a magnetic survey of the ancient cemeteries surrounding the site to better define their boundaries, but human and animal disturbance often made it difficult to discriminate between burials, pits and burrows of comparable magnetic intensity. Finally, there was a concerted effort to organize and establish a new exhibition at Erzurum Museum covering the campaigns at both Bfiyfiktepe Hoytik and Sos Hoytik.2 EXCAVATIONS Medieval Three building phases of the Medieval period have been discerned. The lat- est (Phase I) is fragmentary and represented only by a patchy, thin plaster floor close to the surface. Working around the 1987 exposure, in the centre of the mound, a coherent plan of the second building phase began to emerge. The settlement of this phase is orientated northeast-southwest and comprises rectan- 'The Sos Hoyuk 1995 project had a staff of twenty-four: Antonio Sagona (University of Melbourne), Mustafa Erkmen (Director of Erzurum Museum), Hilmi Ozkorucuklu (Erzurum museum), Guiler Barin (Erzurum Museum), Claudia Sagona (University of Melbourne), Peter Brennan (obsidian and magnetometer), Ian Thomas (palaeoecologist), Keppel Turnour (surveyor), Mihrican Kilg (conservator), Bronwyn Douglas (photographer), Andrew Anastasios (video opera- tor), Liza Hopkins, Anna Parker, Tarikh Giulctirk, Peter Davies, Matasha McConchie, Meaghan Wilson, Sarah Howells, Stephie Nikoloudis, Rosalie Prince, Michael Rankin, Karen Meehan, Jonathan Meurs, Richard Heap. We wish to record our appreciation to the Anitlar ve Mtizeler Genel Mudurlugu for granting us permission to undertake the investigations, and to the Vali of Erzurum, Oguz Berberoglu, and his staff, in particular Fehmi Bedir, Director of Culture, for their unstinting support. Our thanks are also extend to Dr. Ozer Yilmaz of the Department of Geography, Atatuirk University, for information on the Pasinler region. The drawings of the finds were produced by several members of the team including M. Wilson, A. Parker and J. Meurs, and inked by A. Sagona and C. Sagona; trench plans were plotted by various trench supervisors and inked by A. Sagona. The project was funded by the Australian Research Council. 2The exhibition was officially opened by His Excellency the Australian Ambassador in Ankara, Mr David Evans, on 4 August. We are very grateful to him, his wife, Mrs Pamela Evans, and to the Embassy staff for their interest and encouragement.</page><page sequence="2">L14 I i I UNEXCAVATED .?....... , , EDG OF MON )- ^EDGE OF MOUND IS .HELLENISTIC WALL PLASTERED SURFA 1P 10 IRON AGE WALL &lt;- l COMPACTED SURF MUD BRICK PLASTERED WALL ,CE 0 f 1 2 3 4m i I l I I ' Fig. 1.

Some of the rooms were fitted with deep clay-lined ovens. The quality of building varies from structures that are straight and well aligned to those that were constructed rather hurriedly. Phase III, the earliest Medieval level, is still represented only in L14 by the northern half of a rectangular house, which this year was found to have walls four courses thick.3 A good range of material was associated with the Medieval levels, though no major change can be observed in the assemblage. Hard, thin-walled cooking wares with incised wavy and horizontal lines and spurred handles characterise this period (Fig. 5:1). The occasional piece such as the lid fragment in Fig. 5:3 was decorated with splashes of red paint. Among the small finds is a clay smok- ing pipe (Fig. 7:1) moulded from greyish brown (O1YR 5/2) clay and orna- mented with a comb-stamped design.4 Considerable quantities of lithic material occur in all levels at Sos Hoyiik, and are in the preliminary stages of analysis. Among the lithics from Medieval Sos is a black obsidian blade which had been re-knapped along its edges to remove triangular shaped microliths (Fig. 14:1, 12). The resultant waste fragment has a distinctive zigzag appear- ance. Tools made from stone other than obsidian are rare at Sos. One such item is a keeled scraper made of a basaltic pale grey stone (Fig. 14:3). On both sides of the tool are patches of a black residue, clearly visible to the naked eye. Although there is still not a single glazed sherd that may assist us with chronol- ogy, no new evidence has come to light that necessitates a shift away from our earlier proposal of a thirteenth century A.D. date for Medieval Sos.5 Hellenistic A gap of about a millennium and a half separates the topmost settlement from the next, the Hellenistic, which consists of only one building phase. Presently localized in trenches L13 and L14, this period is represented by a large, burnt building sharply truncated by the southern edge of the mound's summit (Fig. 1; P1. V(a)). An anteroom, separated from the main room by a mudbrick wall, extended the length of the structure at the western end. Careful clearance of the fill within the structure revealed a substantial deposition of burnt and partly burnt beams, some split in half, used as reinforcement in the superstructure. The well-preserved wooden capital found last year in trench L14 belongs to the same debris.6 It is clear from the size of the building, which measures at least 14.5 x 8-5 m., and the energy expended in its construction that we are dealing with a public structure of some sort, though its precise function is unclear at this stage. Walls were built of mudbrick on sturdy stone foundations originally four courses thick. The mudbricks were best delineated in the north-western corner of the building where they were found lying flat. They are square in shape (37.5 x 375 cm.) and were burnt to an orange colour from the violent fire that destroyed the building about 150 B.C.7 The intense heat of the fire is also 3Sagona, Sagona and Ozkorucuklu 1995: fig. 4. 4Cf. examples from the Dokuzun Han, Konya, established by the Selcuks in the 13th century, A.

Despite the destruction, it was clear that the floor, though slumped in parts, and the walls were finely plastered. There is good evidence for the methods of roofing. A section of col- lapse revealed a thick layer of mud which had been coated on the underside with lime and separated from the supporting beams with reed matting. At the eastern end of the building is the focal point, a niche covered in mud plaster and set on a platform against the back wall (PI. V(b)). The feature is well finished and preserved to a maximum height of 55 cm. Its function is not immediately discernible, though the absence of any traces of blackening dis- misses the possibility that it was a hearth. Given its prominent position, oppo- site what would have been the main doorway, it may have been a shrine, or a dais. A section through the western half of the plaster floor revealed that this building followed with an exact correspondence the orientation of a smaller Iron Age building immediately below (P1. V(c)). It is quite clear that the builders of the Hellenistic period extended and re-used an earlier Iron Age structure, though whether a chronological break intervened between the two periods has yet to be determined. Modifications included the strengthening of the interior face of the east wall with a lining of stone and the re-use of a seg- ment of wall that joins it at a right angle, perhaps to serve as a screen for the entrance in the northeast corner. The north side of the Iron Age building was extended by nearly two metres, whereas the west wall, which contained the entrance, was demolished and sealed by the Hellenistic floor. Very little material was found in the destruction debris, as if the inhabi- tants had time to clear the structure before it collapsed. In fact, to judge from the number of pits that cut the floor and were subsequently sealed by the burnt debris, it appears that the building was abandoned for a short period before destruction. An intact coarse ware pot (Fig. 6:1) buried up to the rim and placed against the wall in the northwest corner was the most notable find. It contained, in the top, the remains of calcined animal (sheep?) bones and pieces of carbonized dung (?) perhaps used to burn the content, and, in the bottom half, some unburned bones, including those of rodents. Near the pot, to the west, a plaster-lined pit dug before the destruction of the building contained a ceramic bull's head (Fig. 7:4) once part of a dark brown (7.5YR 3.5/2) bur- nished animal-headed vessel. In contrast to the small quantity of finds in the L13 structure, much pot- tery was found in K14, mostly local coarse wares and fragments of large storage jars. So far fine ware sherds are few in number. The orange (5YR 6/6) slipped open bowl decorated with impressed palmettes below a band of grooved hori- zontals (Fig.5:5) and a dribble-patterned bowl (not illustrated) have strong affinities with material from Biiytiktepe Hoytik.8 The limited exposure in K14 precluded a precise understanding of the stratigraphic sequence, but the blown glass fragment of a transparent olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) flask (Fig. 7:2) found in the trench in a context that is slightly later than the Hellenistic building suggests some occupation towards the end of the first century A.D.9 This date is sup- ported by the cubical bone die (Fig. 7:3) found nearby with numbers repre- sented by dot-centered circles and arranged on opposed faces in a 6:4, 5:3, 2:1 8Sagona, Pemberton and McPhee 1992: fig. 9: 3, 7 and Sagona, Pemberton and McPhee 1991: fig.7:6. 9Cf.

An almost identical die from Parthian context was found at Nush-i Jan.10 Two burials of the Hellenistic period were excavated in Area B. One, Tomb 12, had been pillaged long ago; the other, Tomb 13, a stone-lined cist, was found intact (P1. VI(a)). The area of Tomb 13 was defined, on the surface, by six large stones placed to form an approximate circle 4-6 m. in diameter, and two large capping stones positioned in the centre. Built of rhyolite, the burial cham- ber lay beneath a thick (56 cm.) layer of rubble and was orientated along an east-west axis. The chamber measured 140cm. along the length and 80cm. across the width. Its northern and southern walls consisted of four large, roughly hewn stones, whereas the eastern and western ends were each sealed by a single stone. Two skeletons, one superimposed on the other, were found in the tomb. The topmost, a male, lay on its left side with knees drawn and left arm over his body (P1. VI(a)). Immediately beneath it lay a brittle female skeleton bedded in soft brown soil. Placed in a similar position on her right side she was adorned with a pair of silver earrings (Fig. 7:5). Each corpse was provided with a silver drachm found beneath its hip.11 Both coins are badly worn with no inscriptions visible, but enough detail remains on one, the coin associated with the male skeleton, to classify it as a type of Alexander the Great. It has, on the obverse, the head of Herakles wear- ing a headdress. The reverse depicts an enthroned figure (Zeus) to the left, with his left hand raised (holding a sceptre?) and right hand outstretched (originally with an eagle perched on it?). The second coin is possibly the same type with the reverse showing a seated figure. A notch on the edge of both coins presumably to test their purity suggests they may have been used as bullion rather than coinage. Dating these coins with some precision is difficult. Although the coin type of Alexander the Great was struck at many mints in Asia Minor during the third century B.C., the test cuts and abraded condition of these coins suggest an even longer period of circulation before burial. It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that the burials in Area B are contemporary with the large burnt build- ing on the mound. Iron Age The Iron Age is only just beginning to emerge at Sos. In addition to the partially exposed building in L13, Iron Age deposits were uncovered in trenches J14, K14 and L16. Of these exposures, the sounding along the west side of J14 provided a clear depositional sequence. The thick plaster floor (dated by radio- carbon last year to the tenth century B.C.)12 was reached, and on top of it lay the well preserved carbonised remains of a rush mat and a wicker spiral-woven bas- ket (Pls VI(b, c)); fragments of twine, some knotted, were also found. To judge from the thick deposit of charcoal and mud brick debris superimposed above the floor, the structure must have been quite substantial, and will be investigated next season. Presently, the nature of our evidence for the Iron Age, consisting of spot samples from trenches spread across the mound, precludes all but a preliminary '?Curtis 1984:fig.19:486; Cf. Goldman 1950:fig. 273:89 (Tarsus) and Stronach 1978: fig. 92:8, pl. 169: e-g (Pasargadae). Sos has also yielded a spindle whorl decorated on the lower surface with a ring-and-dot design. Cf.

Nonetheless, certain trends can be observed even at this stage. Associated with the plaster floor in J14 is a wheelmade black ware represented by jars (Fig. 5:2) and carinated bowls (Fig. 5:9). Closer attention appears to have been paid to their finish on the interior, generally black burnished, than to their exterior surface, which was given a perfunctory polish before firing it to a reddish brown or beige, or mottled variations within that colour range. 3Later in date, again from J14, is the sharply carinated open bowl illustrated in Fig. 5:8.14 It is brown (5YR 5.5/5) throughout and lightly burnished on both sur- faces. The late Iron Age (Achaemenid period) is best evidenced by material from immediately beneath the plaster floor of the Hellenistic building in L13, and exposures in L16 and 17b. From L13 came the red-slipped grey ware bowl with flanged rim (Fig. 5:7) and the dark brown burnished sherd decorated with a pointille design (Fig. 5:10)'5. Also of Achaemenid date are the distinctive bur- nished bowls of gadrooned form (Fig. 5:4, 6) which are no doubt based on metal prototypes. One (Fig. 5:4) has a reddish brown (2.5 YR 4/6) slip, the other (Fig. 5:6) is greyish brown (IOYR 4.5/2). Grey ware examples occur at Parsagadae, while at Kalecik, near Erzincan, brown burnished types were found associated with Triangle Ware.'6 The deep black burnished conical bowl (Fig. 6:2) from L16d also belongs to the late Iron Age. From the same late Iron Age context came two very fine bone needles with fire hardened points (Fig. 7:8,9). More sheep phalanges, some pierced, were found scattered throughout Iron Age deposits.7 One partially worked example (Fig. 7:6) has the tip of the stone drill bit jammed in the hole. Obsidian tools from the Iron Age are mostly side and notched scrapers, or composite tools (Fig. 14:2) comprising two or more functions. A finely retouched point (Fig. 14:4) was among the finds of Tomb 3, Area C, a poorly preserved burial of the Achaemenid period. At this stage, therefore, it appears that the Iron Age at Sos H6ytik stretches from the tenth century B.C. to the Achaemenid period, though how continuous a depositional sequence it is remains to be determined. Second Millennium B. c. At this stage, we cannot be more specific about sub-periods of the second millennium B.C., nor can we go beyond a general statement concerning finds, as only a small area of the settlement, in M16, has been exposed. During this period occupation was distinguished by compact earthen floors, pits (some quite large), and roughly circular basin-like plaster depressions similar to those found in the Early Bronze Age levels (P1. VII(a)). The lack of any permanent architec- ture suggests that dwellings were probably made of reeds or matting, possibly supported on a post framework standing on flat bases. Pottery has a dark, gritty fabric and is generally quite hard.'8 New forms such as holemouth jars make their appearance and increase in number. Only two pieces of comb-stamped Trialeti ware were found this season; the decorated piece in Fig. 13:6 is Trialeti in flavour, but its fabric is brown (7.5YR 4/3). Painted pottery is likewise rare. One wheelmade sherd, from a slope wash deposit 3Cf. the carinated bowls from Tappeh Gijlar, Pecorella and Salvini 1984: fig. 62: 27-28; and Kroll 1976:Type 12. 14Cf.

In con- tradistinction to the Early Bronze Age levels, hardly any worked bone was recovered from second millennium contexts. Portable hearths too are rarer and not as sturdy as earlier examples, with anthropomorphic features giving way to a design of deeply impressed circles.'9 Obsidian tools include scrapers (nosed with notched edge, Fig. 14:7; backed, Fig. 14:8), parallel-sided blades with trian- gular sections (Fig. 14:9 and 11) and microliths (Fig. 14:5). Early Bronze Age Work continued in trenches M17 and M16, and in L17 two new trenches were opened. Five building levels, all belonging to the late Early Trans- Caucasian culture, have been exposed. While architectural traditions changed within this period, developing from freestanding wattle-and-daub houses to mud brick rectilinear dwellings, preliminary observations of the pottery suggest no major evolution. The latest building level was represented by a dwelling built of pale brown mud bricks set on two courses of stone (Fig. 2). Although a good portion of the structure had been destroyed by modern building activity and pits, one quite large, the structure appears to have been right-angled with at least two rooms. Internal features include a plastered bench, a built-in circular hearth with a ridged kerb and raised central horns, now broken, and a circular, plastered shal- low basin.20 A freestanding room that approximates a rectangle with rounded corners distinguished the next level, the most extensive Early Bronze Age deposit so far exposed (Fig. 3). Its floor was plastered, but not as skillfully as that of its annex attached to its eastern side. The lack of mudbrick debris in the fill suggests that its walls were of wattle-and-daub, though careful digging failed to reveal any holes for posts such as normally support structures of this type. A row of small field stones (two rows along the western side) formed its foundations, while a central post clearly visible as a dark discolouration in the soil supported its roof. One entered the room through a doorway placed along the west side; which abutted part of an earlier curved wall preserved to a height of four stone courses. On the floor were many fragments of portable andirons and a large amount of pottery, especially on and around the ash surface in the northeast corner. The area south and west of this room appears to have been a courtyard with three plastered basins, presumably used to prepare food: two are circular in shape, whereas the largest comprises a conjoint pair of basins, one built higher than the other (P1. VII(b)). It is unlikely that these plastered features were used as hearths, since none showed any trace of blackening. Immediately below this level, in M17a/b, is part of another round-cornered rectangular room, with foundations up to four courses deep (Fig. 4). Abutting the western side of the house is a plaster surface, while to the southwest a sub- stantial wall was partly exposed. In plan, these round-cornered rooms can be compared to the well-known wattle-and-daub dwellings from Trans-Caucasus, in particular Georgia, and the Turkish Upper Euphrates basin, while noting that the Sos houses lack the normally standard fixtures of a back bench and built-in '9A hearth from Sos is stylistically similar to andirons found at Kusura, Diamant and Rutter 1969: fig. 17b (reconstruction). 20Cf.

South of the wall, presumably inside a room, was a flat-topped U-shaped andiron deco- rated with a pair of shallow grooves on its surface. This trench provided two radiocarbon readings: one from charcoal collected around the portable hearth yielded a calibrated date range (two sigma, 95% probability) of 2890-2555 and 2535-2495 B.C., the other from a bell-shaped pit that cut this level extends from 2120-2080 to 2050-1730 B.C.23 Excavations in L17a has revealed the earliest building level. It comprises a stone surface set in soft soil distinguished by circular depressions, one shaped like the figure eight. Each depression yielded a considerable amount of material, including two intact and highly burnished vessels with accentuated girths (Fig. 10:1,2; P1. VIII(d): top centre and right). A substantial retaining wall defines the northern edge of this feature, while on the other side of the wall a large basalt mortar was set into a hard-packed surface. Scattered throughout all the building levels were fragments of anthropomorphic andirons (Fig. 9; PI. VIII(c)). Basically U-shaped with three projections, they come in a wide range of dimen- sions. The two illustrated here find their closest parallels at Giizelova.24 The very end of the Early Trans-Caucasian cultural phase and the period immediately after, termed Martkopi in Georgia, is most clearly defined by mate- rial found in a pit that cut the southern wall of the rectilinear mud brick build- ing. In the pit was a large, incised biconical jar (Fig. 8; P1. VIII(a)) which bears a strong affinity with vessels from the Martkopi kurgans.25 Stylistically, the Sos jar, like Martkopi pottery, probably derived from metal prototypes. Its thin walls are well-burnished and black on the outside, except for the abruptly curv- ing rim which is skillfully fired to a red brown (10R 4/8) colour. Its ornamenta- tion does not descend below the widest diameter. Around its lower neck is a row of concentric lozenges highlighted with red ochre paste applied after firing, whereas the carination and upper neck are decorated with ancillary incisions. Accompanying the jar were fragments of a wheelmade grey 'Syrian Bottle' slipped on the outside in black (Fig. 10:9). This outlier belongs to a type hith- erto unknown from northeastern Anatolia, but at home south of the Taurus where it is an index for the period 2400-2300 B.C.26 From the top of the same pit came a finely incised open black bowl displaying a band of latch-hooks and tri- angles set below the rim, and a stylized pattern over the belly zone (Fig. 11:1). Although not "Martkopi" in the strict Georgian sense of the term, its delicate ornaments, which draw close parallels from Shengavit and Elar in Armenia, allow it to be placed within the same late horizon.27 21These wattle-and-daub structures have been found, among other sites, at Khizanaant Gora C-B, Kvatskhelebi C-B, Arslantepe VIB1, Norsuntepe, Degirmentepe III and I, and Taskun Mevkii 3.

The commonest bowl has a pronounced belly generally set low on the pro- file. They were manufactured in a range of sizes from cups with solid lug han- dles and small dimple bases (Fig. 10:3) to larger vessels with tall necks turned outwards at the rim (Fig. 10:1, 2; PI. VIII(d)). These bowls are invariably black, and have a highly burnished exterior surface contrasting with an interior of rougher finish. Two bowls found in close proximity to each other in Trench L17a are noteworthy for their lustrous black polish (Fig. 10:1,2). Certain frag- ments also bear a silvery, almost mirror-like surface produced by rubbing graphite onto the surface at the leather-hard stage prior to burnishing. A more sinuous profile is found on the single-handled cup (Fig. 10:10). Originally a pale reddish brown (5YR 5.5/6), its exterior has been fired to a variegated appearance ranging from beige (5YR 6/1) to black. Its shape, mottled colours and dimple impressed on top of the handle are reminiscent of cups from Kvatskhelebi C.28 Carinated bowls do occur (Fig. 10:6-7), though the biconical-shaped vessel with a beaded rim (Fig. 10:8) is rare.29 Vertical-sided bowls and those with an incurving rim (fig. 10:11) are likewise uncommon. The latter's decoration of solid pellets set at the girth reminds one of similarly orna- mented bowls from the Keban region, most notably at TaSkun Mevkii, but its plain brown fabric and shape (those at Ta?kun are more open) suggest a much later derivative.30 Connections with the Keban sites, however, are clearly seen in the fluted pot stand (Fig. 11:3), which is especially close to those from Korucutepe, and the pot lid with a central depression and incised design (Fig. 13:8).31 The closed bowl with all-over perforations (Fig. 11:4) complements the one found last season;32 their function, however, is yet to be determined. Decoration is not uncommon, but restricted to specific vessels, especially trays (Fig. 11:6). Although no complete example has been found, their shape can be clearly discerned. They have a roughly apsidal-shaped base, with a flat, high and elaborately decorated front; the sides and back edge of the trays are low. Similar trays have been found at Guizelova, but the examples from Sos display more sophistication in the execution of design.33 On the well-made cup, Fig. 11:2, decoration is limited to two rows of hatched triangles, whereas an unusual triangular-shaped container (Fig. 11:5) has an extensive pattern on one side.34 Large jars were also polished with care on the outside and over the rim on the inside. The one illustrated here (Fig. 6:3) is bag-shaped and plain, though quite a number of fragments of large vessels were decorated in relief with tight spiral designs. Obsidian is the primary material used in the manufacture of stone imple- ments during the Early Bronze Age. The industry consists primarily of scrapers with a large number of flakes displaying one or more cortex faces (Fig. 14:13, 15), testifying to the exploitation of alluvial obsidian that has washed down stream from a source near Btiyiik Dere, north of Pasinler.35 Tools made from 28Sagona 1984: fig. 85:2. 29Sagona 1984: fig. 37:5. 30Sagona 1994: fig. 32:10-13.

Multiple notches are combined with awls and straight edges to form composite tools (Fig. 14:6). Nosed scrapers occur (Fig. 14:10) with one piece bearing incised lines along its back (Fig. 13:5). Microlith points also figure among the obsidian tools (Fig. 14:14 and 16). Most of the lithic finds appear to be informal in their shape, but do fall into func- tional categories. An exception is a large well-worked obsidian scraper with dis- tinct bulbar scar and striking platform, and extensively retouched edges (Fig. 13:2). Flint tools are rare and restricted to this period. Two well fashioned, par- allel-sided flint blades were found in close proximity to each other in clear Early Bronze contexts (Fig. 13:3-4). Both are trapezoidal in section and display vary- ing degrees of retouch along the edges; one has a lustrous sheen from heavy uti- lization (Fig. 13: 4). Similar tools were found by Ko?ay at Giizelova, Pulur and Karaz.36 Fine textured black or grey basalt were also as raw material, usually for the manufacture of round end scrapers and large choppers. Finally, attention is drawn to a well-polished edge ground axe (Fig. 13:1). The Early Bronze Age bone industry is well developed. It includes a comb with what were closely spaced teeth (Fig. 12:6; P1. VIII(b)), well-crafted fasteners (toggle pins?, Fig. 12:1,3), a single-barbed point (Fig. 12:2), a tanged arrowhead (Fig. 12:4), an eyed needle (Fig. 12:11), pointed awls and spindle whorls. Again Guizelova provides the best parallels. 7 An unprovenanced bone pendant (Fig.7:7) has been tentatively placed within this assemblage. Two bronze ear- rings were found: one has overlapping pointed ends (Fig. 12:9), the other is lunate in form (Fig. 12: 10). Similar pointed end earrings have been found in EBIII contexts at several sites, while a gold lunate pair was among the grave goods in Martkopi Kurgan 5. 8 Other metal work includes a round-sectioned pin with a flattened rolled end (Fig. 12:7) and two points, one with rivet marks still visible (Fig. 12: 8, 12).39 Other small finds include a white pierced shell pen- dant (Fig. 12:5) and an animal figurine (Fig.12:13).40 PALAEOECOLOGY: A PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF THE PASINLER VALLEY AT Sos HOYUK The geography and palaeoecology of eastern Anatolia have played pivotal roles in determining many aspects of cultural shifts during the Holocene.41 The most important of these roles was in fostering pastoral nomadism, facilitating the domestication of plants and animals and nurturing the subsequent develop- ment of urbanization. All of these activities can be assumed to have left their signature, however cryptic, on the environment of eastern Anatolia. In spite of the importance of these developments and the close cultural links 36For example, Kosay and Vary 1967: pl.

Instead, much of what is known about environmental change in eastern Anatolia comes from sites in southern and central Anatolia, or further afield in the Levant.42 The closest palaeo- environmental sites to the Erzurum-Pasinler region are located in central and northern Anatolia.43 Those sites, however, are not close enough to Sos Hoyiik to provide insights into the vegetational changes of the Pasinler Plain, or the effects the Sos settlement had on the ecology of surrounding hill slopes and ranges. This project aims to analyse fossil pollen contained in wetland deposits near Sos Hyuiik and in archaeological sediments excavated at the ancient site. Pasinler valley is geomorphologically complex and many problems of landform interpretation need to be resolved. For instance, it is not entirely clear if the chaotic hump and hollow landscape on the northern side of Dere Suyu at Sos is one caused by earthquake and landslides, or by glacial erosion and deposition. Both explanations have merit, although a consideration of the cirque like bowls high on neighbouring ridge tops and the form of moraine-like dumps of angular and sub-angular boulders, gravels and clay, suggest that the latter is more likely. The age and derivation of the valley and mountain deposits are critical in the development of models to explain environmental and cultural changes in the area. The presence of extensive periglacial blockfields within the highest cirque like formations on the Kargapazar Daglan, for example, suggests a minimum age corresponding to the penultimate glacial phase. If the cirques are of Riss (Middle Russian) age, archaeological deposits found in valley moraine deposits may have a maximum age of &gt; 100,000 years. If, on the other hand, short valley glaciers were active during the Wurm (Valdain) glacial phase, archaeological deposits are more likely to be very late Pleistocene or Holocene in age. At least two cirques contain remnant stands of Quercus in Krummholtz form. This raises the intriguing possibility of tracing the migration of these taxa, and others, as Pleistocene climates changed into those of the Holocene. Core samples were taken from peat deposits and wetlands near the base of the Kargapazari Range. Preliminary pollen analyses of basal samples from a number of sites indicate that abundant pollen of Pinus, Quercus, Betula, Asteraceae, and Cyperaceae exists in a matrix with large numbers of carbonised particles. These seems little doubt that upon completion, the core series will pro- vide a valuable palaeoenvironmental adjunct to the cultural sequences excavated at Sos Hoyiik. The use of multiple sites from varying altitude will facilitate regional comparisons as well as allowing a model of local plant community dynamics to be developed with a strong emphasis on changing spatial patterns. Further exploratory work is planned for 1996 when the summit plateau of the Palandoken Daglan, south of the Pasinler Plain, will be surveyed for pollen sites. 42Bottema, Entjers-Nieborg and Van Zeist 1990. 43SiteSeer 1995. 50</page><page sequence="29">EXCAVATIONS AT SOS HOYUK, 1995 BIBLIOGRAPHY Algaze, G., (ed.), 1990.
