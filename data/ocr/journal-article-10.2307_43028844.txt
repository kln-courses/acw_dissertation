<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 4:3 (1987) 254 Book Reviews Dwellers in the Land: The Bioregional Vision by Kirkpatrick Sale (San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1985, 228 pp. $14.95). Kirkpatrick Sale's writings are familiar to those who have followed progressive social movements in the U.S. since the late 1960's. His last book, Human Scale , might well be the most informative source on the ap- propriate technology movement. He is at his best as a committed journalist capturing emerging avenues of social change. I am dis- appointed that he did not bring these talents to the subject of bioregionalism. Instead, Dwellers in the Land : The Bioregional Vision suffers from the flaws of a movement manifesto: thematic grandeur, paucity of documentation, inflated rhetoric, and Utopian conjecture. There is little here to convince the skeptical reader that bioregionalism is more than an idiosyncratic vision. The principal contribution of the book is that, at last, a rounded statement of bioregionalism has become accessible. Not much has been written about this nascent movement and most of what has circulated suffers from a polemical tone and a lack of reflection. The lively style and the intense conviction of the author provide us with a vivid image of a society built around a basic natural system, the bioregion.

He recounts that the enchanted animism of the ancients has been swept away by Islam, Judaism, and Christianity and has been supplanted by the scientific world view of Bacon, Descartes, Newton, and Galileo. Nature is now likened to a machine and the earth's bounty and humankind has been reduced to bundles of commodities fed into an industrial system. Sale crystallizes an alternative to the dominant paradigm around the idea of bioregionalism. After these preliminaries, Sale thrusts upon us the plight our species now faces: ecological crash, or at least the die-off of humans. His argument is restated from the model offered by William R. Catton in Over- shoot: The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change (1980). Sale's treatment is cursory; those seeking an overview of the ecological threat should look elsewhere. Sale introduces a far more useful point of departure in chapter four by quoting at length the Irish writer A. E. (George William Russell), which ends with the punch line: "But I believe our best wisdom does not come from without, but arises in the soul and is an emanation of the Earth spirit, a voice speak- ing directly to us dwellers in the land." Sale urges, in the words of Philosopher Thomas Berry, "a reinvention of the human at the species level." The bioregional vision is a tall order. To get there, Sale advocates a renewed sense of place. His notion of place, however, reads like a natural resource inven- tory. Sale, at last, gets around to telling us what bioregionalism is all about: "bio" is the Greek word for life and "regere" is the Latin for ter- ritory to be ruled. The belief that the human domination of nature must cease and be TABLE 1: INDUSTRIO BIOREGIONAL SCIENTIFIC PARADIGM PARADIGM Scale Region State Community Nation/World Economy Conservation Exploitation Stability Change/Progress Self-sufficiency World Economy Cooperation Competition Polity Decentralization Centralization Complementarity Hierarchy Diversity Uniformity Society Symbiosis Polarization Evolution Growth/Violence Division Monoculture replaced by the governance of nature is the central doctrine of bioregionalism. Sale does not dwell on definitions and offers only a single paragraph on the movement. Concep- tual clarity and an inventory of bioregional activities are warranted here, but are not provided. Rather, Sale draws four implica- tions: know the land; learn the lore; develop the potential; and liberate the self. He con- cludes: "Obviously, bioregionalism is at once very simple and very complicated." And very Zen. There is reason to believe that a bioregional movement stirs in the margins of American life. The most tangible demonstra- tion of that was a remarkable event in April, 1984, at Drury, Missouri: the North American Bioregional Congress. More than two-hundred enthusiastic bioregionalists from over sixty grass-roots organizations gathered to form a continental congress, ex- change ideas, and take stock of where they stood. There is nothing in print which ade- quately tells their story: how they began, how they operate, what success they have achieved, how they spread, etc. I believe that until this is done, bioregionalism will not be widely embraced.</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 4:3 (1987) 256 The clearest notion as to the substance of bioregionalism is provided by a table on page fifty which contrasts bioregionalism with what Sale calls the industrio-scientific paradigm (see Table 1) Sale expounds on scale, economy, polity, and society in turn for the next four chapters, the heart of the book. The bioregional scale matches human potential with ecological reality. Sale asserts that Gaea's first law is that the biosphere is not organized around "human dictates," but around natural regions. The precise borders among bioregions are identifiable by ecology but should be flexible and fluid. A hierarchy of bioregional types is suggested: the community, the mor- phoregion, the georegion, and the ecoregion. All are bounded softly by ecosystems espe- cially obvious to the natives. Societies which dominate nature also dominate people. This insight provides the core of the discussion of the bioregional society. Tribalism and localism in accord with the laws of Gaea would mark the bioregional society. The chapter on economy rests on "laws of ecodynamics" and advocates the steady-state economy which melds town and country, agriculture and industry, a Utopian vision proposed by Kropotkin long ago. Bioregional politics rests on invigorated citizenship in face-to-face assemblies. The discussion reaches fever pitch with the sort of chimerical imagery found throughout the text: Where all individuals are citizens , involved in the civitas, the true powers of complemen- tarity are revealed . The strong hues and deli- cate tints, the bold splashed and slender lines , the full range of color and value , of shape and pattern , are evident in the canvas of a community's civic life , all parts contributing to the smoothness , the strength , even the mag- nificale of the whole. Part III begins with the question, "...but how do we get from this world to that?" Sale responds that, just as in nature, the answer will unfold. Bolstering nature's mandate, the author claims that bioregionalism is an effec- tive political project for three reasons: First, it is grounded in American history; second, it "accords well" with the present realities; and third, its vision is practical and realistic. I find this speculation overwhelmingly naive and unconvincing. Two related political tendencies are of- fered as surrogates for bioregionalism: separatism and classical regionalism. Sale points to cases of separatism in Europe, claiming that popular regional consciousness is alive and well. He reminds us of the classi- cal regionalist tradition of Frederick Jackson Turner, Lewis Mumford, Sir Patrick Geddes, and Howard Odum. Reports of a revival, however, are greatly exaggerated. Still, there is much to be borrowed from this tradition. For example, the regional survey invented by Geddes and the notion of the organic region so richly depicted by Mumford are well worth injecting into the bioregional project. Dwellers in the Land concludes with an im- passioned plea for humankind to realize that life on earth is in jeopardy and that the bioregional vision provides a historical pos- sibility. He ends with the remark, "Because what other choice, really, do we have?" Are bioregional utopia and oblivion our only choices? I found all this a bit whimsical and came away feeling empty. Now, I happen to know something about bioregionalism's field ac- tivities and wish that Kirkpatrick Sale had pulled together their story, for I believe that there is much to be said. I was disappointed that the author of Human Scale had not fol- lowed that success with the documentation of yet another grass-roots movement. This was obviously not his intention.</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 4:3 (1987) 257 The subtitle provides a clue to the limita- tions of this book: its subject is the bioregional vision, not the bioregional move- ment. Sale seeks to expound this vision, not to explain the origins and practices of a nas- cent movement. Dwellers in the Land is a prologue to a much needed documentation of the bioregional movement. The skeptical practitioner will not rush off into ecocentrism as a result of this encounter with bioregionalism. Superficially, progres- sive design and bioregionalism have some things to share: a deep conviction that people should participate in the design process, that the site should conform in scale and substance to the surrounding area, that local culture and artistic sensibility should be enhanced, and so forth. Bioregionalism, however, radically opposes the business as usual of design of the built environment so long as it is essentially an anthropomorphic enterprise. Greening a site here or there will not do. The project of bioregionalism is the re-imagination of the whole of humanity in the natural world. This is the challenge posed by Kirkpatrick Sale. How is this done? Listen to the Earth spirit? Become dwellers in the land? I still want to know. REFERENCES Catton WR Jr. (1980) Overshoot: The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change.
