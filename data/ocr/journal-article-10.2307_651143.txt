<plain_text><page sequence="1">"THE FATALL VESPER": PROVIDENTIALISM AND ANTI-POPERY IN LATE JACOBEAN LONDON* In the autumn of 1623, an unknown engraver devised an arresting print depicting a recent catastrophe in the London district of Blackfriars, a graphic polemical image which he some time later made available for sale in a centrally located metropolitan book- shop. (Plate 1.) The subject of this highly provocative engraving was a spectacular and horrifically fatal accident which had occurred on the afternoon of Sunday, 26 October. A large garret adjoining the French ambassador's residence, in which a congrega- tion some three hundred strong had gathered to hear a celebrated Jesuit by the name of Robert Drury preach, suddenly and dramat- ically collapsed. In the middle of the sermon the floor of the makeshift chapel gave way, carrying with it the chamber below, and plummeting the preacher, a fellow priest and over ninety of his auditors to their deaths. The falling masonry also bruised and maimed many other members of this heterogeneous assembly of individuals of both sexes, all ages and a range of nationalities; an assembly in which avowed Catholics commingled with vacillating Protestants, the devout with the inquisitive, and high-ranking recusant gentry with artisans and servants of the "middling" and "meaner" sort. Crowds rapidly thronged to the scene of the carnage and the city authorities were forced to take swift action to close off the site and assist the survivors. A number of the mutilated corpses drawn from the wreckage before nightfall had vanished mysteriously by dawn, presumably borne away by dis- traught friends and relatives for private burial elsewhere. Following the coroner's inquest the next morning, most of the remaining bodies were unceremoniously interred in a mass grave within the embassy's grounds.' * I am grateful to Professor Patrick Collinson, Professor John Bossy, Dr Margaret Aston, and the members of the Tudor Seminar in Cambridge and the Early Modern British Religious History Seminar at the Institute of Historical Research, London, for their valuable comments on earlier versions of this essay. 1 The most detailed accounts of the accident, based on eye-witness reports and including the coroner's list of the victims, can be found in W.

It followed in the wake of the unpreced- ented outburst of popular royalist and anti-Spanish sentiment inspired by the arrival in England of Prince Charles and the duke of Buckingham after six months of frustrating and humiliating negotiations in Madrid for a marriage alliance with the Habsburg Infanta, Maria. Barely three weeks had elapsed since the excite- ment and jubilation that greeted their rather shamefaced home- coming had transformed it unexpectedly into a triumphal march. Indeed, the Blackfriars accident has consistently been eclipsed and overshadowed by the return of the prodigal young Stuart prince and his entourage; by the enduring repercussions of an episode that signalled both the passing of Anglo-Spanish dynastic plans, and an about-face in political priorities which eventually took shape in the advent of a bellicose foreign policy. If historians have accorded it significance at all, it is in the context of the "anti- Catholic backlash" that was the immediate legacy of retreat from the Spanish match. More often it has simply been ignored and overlooked.2 Yet, as an index of collective religious and political convictions (n.

The catastrophe sparked off a fiercely emotional reaction on the part of the surrounding populace, and generated an extraordinary volume of heated discussion both at street level and in sophisticated circles. A notable talking-point at the time, it continued to echo in popular consciousness into the 1680s and beyond. The coroner's jury returned the verdict that the calamity was the result of the excessive strain that the weight of the huge crowd had exerted on the timber struts supporting the attic, but to pamphleteers, preachers, and at least a segment of the wider population, this was no mere "accident", no "natural" disaster. Although the vocabulary of chance and misfortune frequently slipped into contemporary reports, commentators of all stand- points enthusiastically acknowledged or tacitly conceded that the debacle at Blackfriars was not in fact a random, contingent event, but on the contrary an awe-inspiring and foreordained act of God - a signal token of the workings of divine providence. Deciphering what it communicated about the preferences and the grievances of the Almighty, decoding the supernatural message it contained, was, however, a rather more contentious task. In this article, I want to examine in some detail the providen- tialism that underlay early Stuart responses to this suburban tragedy, and to locate these interpretations within a cultural climate that nurtured an unruly and elastic cluster of assumptions about the active interference of God in the created world. This was a frame of reference and a web of beliefs that in many respects cut across confessional boundaries, but characteristic of most extant accounts of the "fatall vesper" was the manner in which providentialism fused with anti-popery to form a potent if volatile compound. The temptation to view the downfall of a group participating in an illegal evensong as a wrathful judgement from heaven all too readily fostered popular animosity and preju- dice against "the papists".

It also sheds light on the develop- ment of an increasingly confrontational relationship between rad- ical anti-Catholicism and the ideology espoused by the hierarchy of the established Church. I Predictably, the Blackfriars catastrophe acquired instant and extensive publicity. It was the headline news of its day. According to John Chamberlain, inveterate "Paul's Walker" and confirmed chatterbox and gossip, in London there was "much discoursing . . . of all the circumstances belonging to the busines". "[U]ncertaine reports" synthesized of facts and rumours, truth and hearsay were still being broadcast widely by word of mouth ten days later.3 Manuscript narratives based on equally indiscrim- inate sources circulated in the capital and passed with private correspondence into the provinces.4 Metropolitan preachers seem to have had something of a field day: William Gouge, Puritan rector of the nearby parish church of St Anne, was by no means 3 Public Record Office, London, State Papers (hereafter P.R.O., S.P.) 14/154/17 (John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton, 8 Nov. 1623), printed in The Letters of John Chamberlain, ed.

Intent on scooping their rivals and securing exclusive coverage, printers and writers whipped together competing accounts of the shocking accident within a matter of weeks. A stream of pamphlets and ballads by authors of every religious bias issued steadily from the presses, items ranging from trite moralistic ephemera to sophisticated clerical exegesis, and from allegedly "impartial" journalism to blatant propaganda of the most bigoted kind.6 5 Gouge, Extent of Gods Providence, preached on 5 November. John Chamberlain had apparently heard several sermons preached shortly after the accident which touched on the subject: P.R.O., S.P. 14/154/17, printed in Letters of John Chamberlain, ed. McClure, ii, p. 521: "I commend our preachers cariage in this accident, for generally they do not dilate nor aggravate yt very much, and for those that I have heard yf they touch yt at al, they do yt temperatly and charitablie". 6 In addition to Goad, Dolefull Even-Song, and W. C., Fatall Vesper (see n. 1 above), the following publications (which perhaps represent only a portion of the original output) have survived: a ballad by Mathew Rhodes, The Dismall Day, at the Black- Fryers: or, A Deplorable Elegie, on the Death of Almost an Hundred Persons, who were Lamentably Slaine by the Fall of a House in the Blacke-Fryers (London, 1623, S.T.C. 20961.5); an anonymous pamphlet entitled Something Written by Occasion of that Fatall and Memorable Accident in the Blacke Friers on Sunday, being the 26. of October 1623, stilo antiquo, and the 5. of November stilo novo, or romano ([London], 1623, S.T.C. 3101); a tract by the Jesuit John Floyd, who identified himself by the letters I. R. P., A Word of Comfort: or, A Discourse Concerning the Late Lamentable Accident of the Fall of a Roome, at a Catholike Sermon, in the Black-Friars at London ... Written for the Comfort of Catholiks, and Information of Protestants ([St Omer], 1623, S.T.C. 11118). Facing the title-page of Cambridge University Library's copy of Goad's Dolefull Even-Song (Peterborough K. 1.19(15)) a contemporary reader has transcribed a witty squib, "The Priests Epitaph who suffered Death in that Downefall", which concludes "Perhaps youl' say it was a strang disaster, / Though they dyde like his sheepe, he like their Pastor. / Let us like Christians judge them, we all hope, / Theire thoughts were then on Christ, not on the Pope". Thomas Cogswell cites another poem on the subject, from a manuscript now in the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, D.C.: Cogswell, "England and the Spanish Match", p. 128. Thomas Adams added an exhortatory epistle referring to the disaster to the published version of the sermon he had delivered at Paul's Cross on the morning of the unhappy event: T. Adams, The Barren Tree. A Sermon Preached at Pauls Crosse October 26. 1623 (London, 1623, S.T.C. 106), sigs. A4-v. In 1624 the Lancashire minister John Gee, who had himself attended Drury's sermon and escaped unhurt from the rubble, prefaced the book he published as evidence of his repentance and reconversion to Protestantism with an apology for his presence in the Blackfriars garret: J. Gee, The Foot Out of the Snare: With a Detection of Sundry Late Practices and Impostures of the Priests and Jesuites in England, 3rd edn (London, 1624, S.T.C. 11703), sigs. A3r-B1r, pp. 5-7. He referred to it again in a sermon delivered almost exactly a year later: J. Gee, Hold Fast: A Sermon Preached at Pauls Crosse upon Sunday, being the xxxi of (cont. on p. 42)</page><page sequence="7">To Protestant publicists, the collapse of a house swarming with Catholics and their sympathizers could only be construed as an open invitation to proclaim the Lord's intense aversion to the "romish" faith, to announce his manifest rage against the adher- ents of the Italian pope. As Don Juan de Mendoza, a distinguished Spanish diplomat, reported to King Philip IV, the "heretics" had impulsively seized upon this harrowing calamity as a singular opportunity to "build a case to attack the Catholic religion".7 Circumstantial details appeared to confirm that this was the handi- work of an ardently Protestant God. It seemed particularly telling, for instance, that similar mishaps had occurred in at least four London churches, including St Anne, Blackfriars itself, without so much as the loss of one human life - "in all which the stones forbare their downeward motion, till the peoples absence".8 Such a selective example of providential justice obviously afforded much metaphorical scope for vaunting claims regarding the figurative confusion of the enemies of the reformed gospel, and the theatrical overthrow of institutionalized idolatry and sacrilege. The disaster was seen as conclusive proof of the unstable theological founda- tions of Roman Catholicism itself.9 Thomas Goad, chaplain to the archbishop of Canterbury, observed that "a topicall inference" might be drawn "from the fall of both the floares, namely, of the preaching, and the Massing roome, that both their Doctrine and Sacrifice are weakely and slenderly supported, and that God was displeased as well with their Pulpits, as Altars". No less alluring was the hypothesis that the ceiling had buckled under the weight of "popish" iniquity, that a "load of sinne pressed them down (n. 6 cont.) October, Anno Domini 1624 (London, 1624, S.T.C. 11705), pp. 63-5. Goad, chaplain to the archbishop of Canterbury, interrogated Gee when he was summoned to Lambeth to explain his deviant behaviour, and his own pamphlet is undoubtedly derived from this examination. He may also have used his position as licenser of the press to call in W. C.'s earlier Fatall Vesper and thereby ensure the success and precedence of The Dolefull Even-Song.

Perhaps most vividly it evoked the final apocalyptic destruction of Babylon foretold in Isaiah and Revelation." Protestant pamphleteers, therefore, viewed the Blackfriars catastrophe as one more milestone in the eternal struggle of the true church against the machinations of Antichrist. But private letter-writers were inclined to diagnose a specific provocation for this providential intervention - the increasingly undisguised resurgence of Catholicism, especially in London and the Midlands, during the preceding twelve months.12 In John Chamberlain's eyes, nothing was "more remarkeable" than the fact that the illicit gathering in the attic was the "first so solemne assemblie of theirs" for the sixty years since Queen Elizabeth's re-establishment of the English Reformation in 1558-9.13 Many, no doubt, instinctively linked the disaster with the legendary "Sicilian Vespers", the massacre of French colonists in Easter week 1282, alleged to have begun spontaneously with the initial stroke of the evensong bell. The allusion to an episode which proverbially embodied the dangers of complacency can hardly have been ignored. 14 Only the anonymous author of an unlicensed 10 Goad, Dolefull Even-Song, sigs.

In his Latin history of the English Province of the Society of Jesus, Henry More celebrated the mass conversions of this period, not least those wrought by William Whittingham, alias Rediate, the other Jesuit who perished at Blackfriars, commonly known as "Sacerdos Pauperum (the Priest of the Poor)": H.

Randle Cotgrave, A Dictionarye of the French and English Tongues (London, 1611, S.T.C. 5830), records under "Vespres Siciliennes", "mischiefes done, or death inflicted, in a place, and time, of imagined (cont. on p. 44) 43</page><page sequence="9">tract risked expressing overtly in print the opinion that this "memorable accident" was a brutal divine stroke against the audacious upsurge in urban "popish" activity which had logically followed upon King James I's "lenative courses": the formal and pragmatic relaxation of the recusancy laws that had accompanied the delicate diplomacy surrounding the Habsburg match.'5 The calamity was a fierce reproof to Catholic effrontery and pride. It was a timely rebuke to the impertinence of those who had boasted of Robert Drury as an orator and evangelist "Nonpareil", capable of outclassing "any Puritane Preacher of the world", and "in comparison of whom the greatest Lights of the Protestant Ministerie" were "but Glowormes".16 God had apparently assessed the alarming evidence of Jesuit insolence in launching so public a missionary campaign, and had intervened to thwart their unbridled boldness "upon a litle connivence".t7 He had sup- pressed a conventicle that surely heralded the imminent pro- clamation of the long-promised official reprieve for adherents of the outlawed faith - the royal pardon over which city papists were said to have openly gloated, and, furthermore, dared to forge and distribute. 8 Such commentators were, however, skating on decidedly thin ice. It was only a small step to the highly seditious proposition that the catastrophe manifested supernatural disapproval of the government's policy of de facto toleration, its mercenary concessions in the interests of securing a Spanish bride. Nor was it considered an uncanny coincidence that the disaster had occurred on 26 October. Adjusted according to the Gregorian calendar used by Roman Catholic countries on the European mainland, this was none other than 5 November - the annivers- ary of the Gunpowder Plot. Few failed to notice the prodigious (n. 14 cont.) securitie". Describing the event in his The Historie of the Holy Warre (Cambridge, 1639, S.T.C. 11464), Thomas Fuller wrote: "Hence grew the proverb of the Sicilian Vespers; though their Even-song was nothing to the English Mattens intended in the Gunpowder treason" (p. 223). I owe both the point and the references to Dr Margaret Aston. 15 Something Written, p. 14.

But the nexus was compel- ling. The visitation was confidently accounted a passionate act of revenge for the sinister "mischiefe" intended by the papists in 1605, retrospective confirmation of their complicity in that dast- ardly scheme.20 It was surely a tangible seal of God's special blessing and protection of the elect English nation, yet another link in the chain of her astonishing providential deliverances from the malevolent forces of Rome and Spain. Although it merits not even a passing mention in David Cressy's Bonfires and Bells, this was another "icon event" destined to be preserved in collective Protestant memory, and to anchor itself in the patriotic annals of post-Reformation history, together with the defeat of the Spanish Armada and the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot.2' Following so closely on the heels of what the young law student Simonds D'Ewes described in his diary as "this great miracle of our latter age" - the divinely contrived return of Prince Charles with neither a Catholic fiancee nor the corrupting taint of her faith the sudden accident must have seemed a second occasion for national rejoicing within the same month, a double confirmation of the Lord's covenant with Stuart England, as with the Israelites of old.22 The tale, moreover, grew much in the telling. The oral passage of news and rumour considerably enhanced the intrinsic symbol- ism of this inauspicious event. Existing details were embroidered and muddled, and a set of fantastic anti-popish accretions irresist- ibly sprang up.23 "[F]irst report went currant", for example, that 19 The Works of the Most Reverend Father in God, William Laud, D.D., ed.

The French ambassador, Tillieres (who had in fact never been present), was reported to have perished himself, in company with "a multitude of blind ignorant people" - the gullible, credulous rabble which Protestant polemicists regarded as easy game for wily Counter-Reformation priests.24 More than a handful were under the mistaken impression that the service in progress had literally been a "mass", a superstitious celebration of the eucharist. This was evidently the conclusion to which the vicar of Eltham, John Ford, who recorded the disaster grimly in his parish register as "a pitiful remembrance to all posteritie", immediately jumped. "[S]o much was God offended with their detestable idolatrie", Ford wrote, that he himself had stepped in iconoclastically to bring it to an abrupt halt. It obviously took little to persuade biased observers that the Almighty had made it his personal business to debunk that central ritual of priestly deception, transubstantiation, and to disgrace lay Catholics as they bowed in worship before the inanimate consecrated bread.25 Equally improbable claims circulated about the precise point at which Drury's sermon had been so rudely interrupted. Some thought it telling that in dilating upon his text (Matthew 18:23-35, the parable of the king and his servants) the preacher had "mod- elled out" popish doctrine in the guise of the "fantasie of Purgatory", the pseudo-sacrament of penance and the illusory heavenly merit of good works, emphasizing the "miserable case" of Protestants who dismissed these spiritual comforts scornfully. Thomas Goad did not "curiously enquire" of the matter - "as making interpretation of Gods judgement in stopping the currant of his speech at that instant" - but others all too eagerly did.26 In the grossly distorted version of events which Joseph Mead, 24 W.

The West Country justice Walter Yonge fancied that the execrations had been levelled directly against Luther, Calvin and the late Dr Thomas Sutton, the vehemently anti-Catholic preacher of St Mary Overy, Southwark, who had drowned in tragic circumstances in September. Drury had supposedly declared that the sea had "swallowed" the latter, "because hee was not worthie the earthe shoulde receve him, att which wordes", so the story went, "the house sancke".27 The papists had seemingly pushed God's patience just too far. Nor did the Norfolk gentleman, Thomas Knyvett, disdain idle gossip that the sermon had focused on another verse from the same Gospel pregnant with far more menacing connotations: "Thou shalt not come out thenc till thou hast payde the uttermost farthing".28 These preposterous and unsubstantiated reports spread alongside suggestions that the homily being preached that afternoon was the public recantation of an apostate - a contrite apology by a Jesuit priest who, despite a sound upbringing in "Papistrie", had temporarily defected to the enemy camp. Recast as the assassina- tion of a renegade in the very act of disavowing the reformed religion and returning "in gremium matris Ecclesiae (to the bosom of the Mother Church)", the accident could additionally serve as a cautionary tale to encourage constancy in back-sliding Calvinists.29 The Blackfriars catastrophe was thus something of a godsend to the Protestant cause. It was crude but none the less convincing propaganda for the thesis that clinging tenaciously to popery was a perilous enterprise; it buttressed the claim that in the economy 27 Brit.

Pamphleteers lost no time in presenting the disaster as a powerful incentive to abandon the sinking Roman ship: those rescued from suffocation and snatched from "the very jawes of Death", urged Thomas Goad, should reflect "whether this sudden stroake and cracke be not the hand, and voice of God, to call them home from wandring after forraine Teachers, that ... carry them hood-winked into the snares of danger, corporall, civill, and spirituall".30 Preachers like Thomas Adams grumbled about the obstinacy of "our wilfull and bewitched Recusants", who "from these legible Characters" would not "spell Gods plaine meaning",31 but they made much of individuals involved in the accident who had instantly converted as a result, not least the disillusioned Lancashire minister, John Gee, whose best- selling expose of the urban Catholic underground, The Foot out of the Snare, was a "monument" to his own narrow and miracu- lous escape from extinction in the "dolefull even-song" and to the divine grace that had plucked him back from the brink of the Babylonian pit.32 Other edifying anecdotes were recounted, including the chronicle of a lame woman badly injured in the downfall who was thereby induced to make a textbook confession of solafidian faith: "If God spare me now, I will never pray to Saints againe; but to my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who onely is my Redeemer".33 No less triumphantly did publicists point to the unhappy fate of one Parker, an agent and "factor" for the English seminaries and convents in the Low Countries, who, having emerged unscathed on 26 October, foolishly yearned to have suffered a sacrificial death with the rest. A week later, his wish was unexpectedly granted when the boat in which he was escorting a niece to a Brussels nunnery overturned without hope of recovery in the Thames.

C.'s The Fatall Vesper on 10 November: "I am informed by the worshipfull M. Thomas Smith of Box-Lane, That ... there was one Mr Walstead a Staffordshire gentlemen (who coming up to London with a resolute purpose to disherite his eldest sonne who was a protestant,) was drawne unto this exercise, and there perished" - before he could finalize this injudicious alteration to his will.35 Catholics themselves were keenly aware that the disaster would seriously hinder their own evangelistic aims. "O what advantage will our adversaries take at this", one lucky survivor bewailed; it would "prove a great scandall to their Religion", foretold a precocious ten-year-old child. The Spanish ambassador, Don Carlos Coloma, was evidently relieved that the calamity had not taken place in the vicinity of his own residence. According to an informant with access to "good intelligence" in Ely House, he had remarked that not "for a million of gold" would he desire the misfortune to be his - it would merely strengthen the argument that God too abhorred the betrothal of England's heir to the Infanta Maria.36 Providence, to all appearances, had played straight into the Protestants' hands. Private grief and sorrow, insisted the Jesuit John Floyd in the tract he wrote to console his dispirited co-religionists, ought therefore to be subordinated to the "publicke defence" of the beleaguered Church of Rome.37 One shrewd and expedient response was to stress the casual, accidental nature of the catastrophe, imputing it entirely to the antiquity of the building and the decayed state of the wooden beam supporting the upper storey. John Floyd countered the insults of his enemies with the observation that "dreadful mis- chance[s]" of this kind were simply miseries "indifferently incid- ent unto mankind", adversities "unto which their owne sect", 4 P.R.O., S.P. 14/154/55 (Chamberlain to Carleton, 21 Nov. 1623), printed in Letters of John Chamberlain, ed.

Calvinist conspirators, it was vindictively whis- pered in the city, had "secretly drawne out the pins, or sawed halfe a sunder some of the supporting Timber" of the second floor room. This tall story had allegedly been fabricated by a certain Dr Price, "a Popish Physician", who "stuck not falsely to say that the Puritans of Black Fryers had done it".40 Others proceeded to "marshall the defunct in the inventory of Martyres", to canonize them in the ranks of those who had relinquished their lives for the greater glory of the Catholic faith.41 Far from damning the victims, their sudden death while devoutly at prayer had actually ensured their salvation, investing them with a distinct aura of sanctity as well. In theological terms, a premature end had been inflicted upon them for the satisfaction of their venial sins, as a merciful substitute and supersedeas for the pains of purgatory. This was nothing less than a short cut to heaven - hence the envious sighs of those extracted from the rubble shaken but virtually without a scratch.42 38 Ibid., pp. 5, 11 and 6 respectively, cf. p. 12.

The Lord, Floyd admitted, was ultimately responsible for this lamentable affair, but when it came to assessing the "holy pur- pose" behind it his clerical antagonists had made an appalling mistake. The Calvinists had no basis for being so "jolly and jocund, so puffed up with pride at the fall of a rotten chamber", since it was as much part of God's overarching providential plan to test and try the righteous through tribulation and hardship, as to discipline the wicked.43 Though it might seem baffling, per- verse, even sadistic to the feeble human intellect, "to send strange disasters upon his servants hath ever been his custome".44 Job and Tobias from the Old Testament and Apocrypha and perse- cuted Christians throughout the pages of ecclesiastical history were shining examples of the forbearance and patience it behoved seventeenth-century Catholics to show in the face of the Blackfriars catastrophe. They were clear evidence that the depravity of men's lives could never be accurately deduced from "the hydeous shew of their deaths" - that it was misguided always to equate suffering with sin. Floyd refuted the "folly" of those who dared to search the "darke mist" of God's mysterious counsels. "[T]o make happy Event a note of the truth, or unlucky successe a signe of falshood" was "to set Religion on the dyce" and "expose Conscience unto Chaunce".45 Analysed from this angle, the disaster might even be interpreted as a mark of God's benevolence and goodwill towards the Catholic Church, a harbin- ger of the "speedy overthrow" of her "hoater Adversaries".46 Floyd deliberately appropriated a scriptural model of supernatural justice rather more complex than the primitive variety of provid- entialism which his Protestant counterparts found it advantageous to employ. He juxtaposed the vision of a loving but enigmatic God whose operations were both incomprehensible and paradox- ical with the jealous Yahweh of Old Testament, systematically meting out rewards for virtue and punishments for vice. 43 Floyd, Word of Comfort, pp. 48, 21 and ch. 4. 44 Ibid., p. 8. 45 Ibid., chs. 1-2, quotations at pp. 11, 4, 27. 46 Ibid., pp. 57, 53. 51</page><page sequence="17">Floyd's sarcastic rebuke of heretical railing against popery "in regard of a vulgar event" had, nevertheless, rather a hollow and sanctimonious ring. He could hardly claim high moral ground in this respect, for as he proceeded to reveal, Catholic polemicists could fight back with the same blunt and undiscriminating tool. He enumerated the ominous tokens of divine wrath manifested since the Henrician and Elizabethan schism and parried Protestant taunts about the shameful death of Father Drury with stories of the unsavoury ends of Continental reformers, including Zwingli and Oecolampadius. Floyd's trump card was the gruesome can- cerous disease that had finally consumed John Calvin, "the Puritans Dad", breeding lice and worms that inexorably ate away his privy parts. The Jesuit was confident that these damaging revelations would effectively deflate his enemies'"insulting spirit" and dissipate their "vayne and frivolous clamors".47 On the Continent, the papists had reputedly published a pamphlet which even more literally returned the humiliating jeers of their enemies upon their own heads, relating the fall of a house in St Andrew's parish in Holborn, where a "a Puritane Preacher and his Psalming Auditorie" had gathered for a Genevan lecture on exactly the same afternoon, and so, one journalist remarked, "by way of inversion" casting "a lye upon us". Clearly the best way of counteracting providential propaganda was to produce it one- self. Catholics could thus be as opportunistic as their rivals in adopting the rhetoric of the innocent sufferer Job when they discovered themselves in compromising situations, and yet making equally extravagant use of fortuitous events that conveni- ently vindicated their cause. They too adeptly exploited the ten- sion between two diverging biblical theories about the deity's administration of the temporal realm.48 Many Protestant writers qualified their own providential ful- minations against the papists with the caveat that it was presump- tuous to scrutinize "the boundlesse Ocean of Gods secret judgements". They were "inscrutabilis abyssus", "an unsearchable 47 Ibid., ch. 3, esp. pp. 27-32, quotations at pp. 20, 30. 48Thomas James, A Manuduction, or Introduction unto Divinitie: Containing a Confutation of Papists by Papists ([London], 1625, S.T.C. 14460), p. 127; 1624.

Those who passed rash and sudden censure on the individuals killed in the accident on no other grounds than their "outward chastisement" were guilty of confounding their "temporall destruction" with their "eternall confusion".49 The Almighty, stressed William Gouge, had other means of differentiating saints from sinners than "externall events"; it was arrogant and unwarrantable for mere humanity to attempt to infer from them the identity of the elect and the reprobate.50 He and his colleagues invariably quoted Luke 13:1-5, the passage in which Jesus reproaches the Jews for imagining that the Galileans executed at Pilate's command and the eighteen men crushed by the tower of Siloam were greater offenders than themselves. Contemporaries should likewise heed Christ's admonition against the error of judging their neighbours ungenerously: "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish".51 According to Thomas Adams, who had preached on this theme at Paul's Cross on the morning of the disaster, it had "pleased God Almighty" only a few hours later "to make a fearfull Comment" on his unwittingly prophetic text. He had expounded in "Characters of bloud" what "His holy Pen had long since written ... with inke". Blackfriars embodied a "terrible remon- strance" rather than a judicial sentence. It was not intended chiefly to avenge the transgressions of the dead, but to instruct and deter evildoers still living.52 Yet careless neglect of the catastrophe deserved just as much reprehension and contempt. This memorable accident was not to be treated as some "nine daies wonder", a novelty briefly pondered over but all too soon forgotten. To deny that it betrayed the stern countenance of an irate deity was no better than blasphemy and atheism in the eyes of Protestant apologists; it was on a par with philosophically rejecting the concept of divine control of the universe in favour of the capricious forces 49 W.

"[W]here we see judgements executed on sinners when they are in their sinne, when they are impudent and presumptuous therein", thundered Gouge, "not to acknowledge such to be judged by the Lord, is to winke against a cleare light".54 In the context of the endless cosmic battle between light and darkness, Christ and Antichrist, it was not only permissible, but arguably obligatory, to "use the language of Canaan", and no "more mannerly .. .then the holy Ghost himselfe" to "plainly denuntiate what God threatens". Moral scruples could apparently be laid safely to one side - lip-service to doctrinal niceties would suffice. Failure to "shew a holy zeale in our anger" against the Roman whore and her followers bespoke a lukewarm and half-hearted commitment to the reformed faith.55 There was clearly little place for compassion or impartiality alongside this belligerent strand of providential discourse. They might coexist, albeit uncomfortably, in ballads like Mathew Rhodes's quite literally "deplorable Elegie" on the "Dismall Day", where the tragic muse who lugubriously relates this "heavy wofull Story" of "mournfull ruth" ("which well may make a stony heart relent"), nevertheless maintains that the dead received their "deserved due" and justly felt God's "furious scourge and Iron Rod".56 But prose accounts of the disaster that aspired to journalistic objectivity and neutrality and affected "an historicall ingenuitie" were ideologically suspect. W. C. anticipated that readers of his Fatall Vesper would be perturbed by its moderate and ambivalent tone, not to say the humanitarian sympathy he voiced for the hapless congregation. Although he was no fence- sitting "Adiaphorist", he defended his claim that the occasion demanded dirges and plaintive ditties, rather than "Satyres and invective speeches". But this evidently smelt suspiciously of Catholicism to some, for speculation about its author abounded when the pamphlet was quickly recalled by the censors for correc- 53 See Adams, Barren Tree, sig.

II Anything but indifference and detachment characterized the behaviour of the crowd that gathered in Blackfriars that autumn afternoon. Some, it is true, voluntarily offered assistance and basic first aid; others were willingly pressed into service by city officers in an operation to dig out the survivors that continued throughout the night. But it was the striking lack of charity of the common people, indeed their deliberate callousness and cruelty, that evoked most comment from metropolitan observers. Predictably, Catholic writers dwelt in calculated detail on the malice of the London rabble. Full of persecuting spirit, it was said, they had viciously assailed the victims with "contemelious speech", railing and "uttering a thousand curses" against these ill-fated adherents of the "romish" faith. The verbal aggression, moreover, erupted into actual physical assault. Not only were the catcalls accompanied by the slinging of mud and stones, but by individual outrages committed as the wounded were carried off through the streets to surgeons and physicians. Bursting with murderous intent, angry groups apparently went on the rampage, besieging the coaches of distressed Catholic gentlewomen beating a hasty retreat; one gang even tried to set fire to the unfortunate occupant of a vehicle crippled by a broken wheel. According to the Venetian ambassador, homicidal bullies set upon a young girl dragged half-dead from the wreckage, nearly depriving her of what little life remained. The accident, he said, "provided the occasion for a general and bloody riot".58 7 W. C., Fatall Vesper, sigs. B2V-3r. For suspicions about W. C.'s confessional identity, see Brit.

Protestant reporters themselves admitted ruefully that at least a section of the tumultu- ous mob that threatened the embassy's gates had looting, vandal- ism and other "ill purposes" in mind. John Chamberlain was astounded at the ferocity of the masses, remarking in a letter to Dudley Carleton in The Hague that "our people beeing growne so sauvage and barbarous" had not only refused to relieve the injured, "but rather insulted upon them with taunts and gibes in their affliction". "[E]ven in Cheapside", he added reprovingly, "where they sholde be more civill".59 The explosive response of the suburban populace to the "fatall vesper", however, can scarcely be described as random or irra- tional. There is a strong case for seeing it as a form of confessional conflict - violence and strife of a kind that at first glance appears completely alien to "civilized" England, immune from the blood- thirsty confrontations that typified the war-torn Continental scene. It should also be examined in the context of the "anti- popish panics" that periodically rocked towns and villages across the country at moments of acute political crisis, injecting friction and discord into communities where, we are told, a degree of mutual compromise usually permitted Catholics and Protestants to live together in relative peace.60 These spasmodic clashes gen- erally originated in deep-seated anxiety about the ubiquitous "popish plot", but the episodes that ensued upon the Blackfriars catastrophe were more reflective of anti-Catholicism's ebullient and chauvinistic other face. They resembled the animated out- breaks of hispanophobia which had swept the capital earlier that decade, when the Spanish ambassadors and their attaches were subjected to many "insolencies", indignities, and much high- spirited verbal abuse at the hands of the "inferiour and baser sort 59 Something Written, p. 27; P.R.O., S.P. 14/153/103 (Secretary Calvert to Secretary Conway, 26 Oct. 1623); P.R.O., S.P. 14/154/17, printed in Letters of John Chamberlain, ed.

The situation had become so unstable by 1621 that the envoys hardly dared leave their residence at all, and in April James I was forced to intervene with a proclamation designed to stifle any further disturbing manifestations of plebeian opposition to the Habsburg match.61 Two years later the targets for attack were no longer essentially political figures, foreign diplomats and strangers on the margins of London society, but native Englishmen and women themselves. Nor was it distant international developments, a dynastic alliance under discussion far away in Madrid, which inflamed the crowd's passions, but instead devotional innovations in the immediate neighbourhood. Above all, in this instance anti-popery was cata- lysed by providentialism. It was in a sense God's own act of sabotage that triggered off the excesses of the local inhabitants, his own iconoclastic stroke against Catholics participating in idol- atrous rites that at once precipitated and legitimated the atrocities that followed. Natalie Davis has suggested that religious riots in sixteenth-century French cities were sometimes motivated by the idea that communities which allowed Catholicism to remain unpunished within their midst necessarily laid themselves open to wrathful visitations from above.62 Here, rather than anticipat- ing the impatient intervention of the Almighty, the people inter- preted the disaster as both a mandate and a cue to carry through the disciplinary process to completion. Perhaps they saw them- selves as merely the instruments and executioners of a higher authority, as collaborators in a programme of ethnic cleansing initiated by their enraged deity. The Jesuit John Floyd hinted as much in upbraiding the common sort for falling upon the victims as if they deserved more punishment still - for usurping God's office "as if he wanted eyther wisedome to know, or justice to 61 See "A Proclamation for suppressing insolent abuses committed by base people against persons of qualitie, as well Strangers as others, in the Streetes of the Citie and Suburbes of London, with the parts adjacent" (8 Apr. 1621), repr. in Stuart Royal Proclamations, ed.

It could be read as a form of protest against a regime that failed to enforce the penal laws against nonconforming Catholics. The violence in Blackfriars also had ritualistic features and a quasi-ecclesiastical structure. The dirt and refuse hurled at mem- bers of the congregation was surely at some level symbolic of Catholicism's polluting and contaminating presence in Protestant London, an ironic rite of purification by desecration.64 Stoning was the sentence inflicted upon Jewish idolators, sabbath breakers, blasphemers and adulterers according to the Mosaic code, and curses too had residually sacred connotations. Far from meaningless expletives, they appealed to ancient beliefs about the ability of human beings to invoke destruction upon other persons and objects, to enlist and manipulate supernatural power for their own ends. Nor did the Reformation entirely discredit impreca- tions of this type, although there always remained a blurred line between merely predicting the plagues the Bible declared would eventually befall flagrant sinners and actively calling down such vengeance from heaven. An official liturgy for the commination of sinners lingered on in the Book of Common Prayer.65 While Protestant zealots in the Netherlands, Germany and France often subjected their Catholic hostages to medieval ordeals of inno- cence, challenging them to prove the protective and thaumaturgic properties of their "God of paste", those involved in the unpleas- ant incidents in England in October 1623 had no need for semi- magical experiments and tests.

They were simply rubbing salt in the wound.66 Yet these solemn overtones should not blind us to the carnival- esque side of the proceedings. The accident obviously put some city dwellers in an exuberant holiday mood; it had indeed released them from their dull sabbatarian routine. Possibly those who sought to ignite the carriage of the wealthy female recusant were not employing intimidatory tactics so much as giving vent to their gleeful exultation at the unexpected annihilation of their popish enemies and peers. It was, after all, just three weeks since bonfires celebrating Prince Charles's return had lined the very same byways and lanes. The euphoria and revelry all too readily spilt over into less innocent forms of anti-Catholic sport.67 Who then were the actors in these street wars of religion? What was the confessional identity of the crowd? Catholics were convinced it was made up of Calvinist fanatics - "infuriati Protestanti", in the Venetian ambassador's expressive Italian phrase.68 John Floyd contended that this anarchic and unchristian conduct was the inevitable consequence of a radical internalization of reformed dogma. These nefarious deeds should not be attrib- uted to English Protestants ("Heresy hath not made them so wild"), but to "Puritans" - to the Puritans of that "one particle of London" which they "boast to be their speciall Nest". The enormities perpetrated in the aftermath of the catastrophe were witness to the "rudenes of their Pretended Holy Discipline", to the antinomian tendencies encouraged by presbyterian tenets and the savagery this "new gospel" instilled in its converts' hearts.69 66 Cf. Davis, "Rites of Violence", p. 157; Scribner, "Reformation, Carnival and the World Turned Upside-Down", pp. 76, 95-7; Phyllis Mack Crew, Calvinist Preaching and Iconoclasm in the Netherlands, 1544-1589 (Cambridge, 1978), pp. 24-6. 67 On this aspect of religious violence, see Scribner, "Reformation, Carnival and the World Turned Upside-Down", esp. pp. 87-9. 68 Calendar of State Papers, Venetian, xviii, p. 147. 69 Floyd, Word of Comfort, pp. 42-3, cf. p. 57. Here Floyd was exploiting a rhetoric developed by conformist divines in the campaign against Puritanism of the 1590s. He was deliberately alluding to Richard Cosin's Conspiracie, for Pretended Reformation: viz., Presbyteriall Discipline (London, 1591, S.T.C. 5823), which sought to discredit the entire Puritan movement on the basis of the fanatical activities of the pseudo- Messiah William Hacket and his accomplices Edmund Coppinger and Henry Arthington; and to Richard Bancroft's two tracts published in the wake of the scandalous Martin Marprelate affair: A Survey of the Pretended Holy Discipline (London, 1593, S.T.C. 1352); Dangerous Positions and Proceedings, Published and Practised... under Pretence of Reformation, and for the Presbiteriall Discipline (London, 1593, S.T.C. 1344).

The many pious feather-makers who based their businesses in fashion- able upper-class finery in the parish of St Anne were particularly notorious: their choice of a vocation so sharply at odds with Calvinist strictures against sumptuary excess made them a favour- ite subject for satire and comic caricature on the metropolitan stage.70 To all appearances, the mob was composed of the "hotter sort of Protestants", individuals who exhibited more than a cour- teous distaste for the Roman Catholic faith. But as Peter Lake has reminded us, anti-popery can hardly be regarded as a exclus- ively Puritan trait.71 Indeed, those with "precise" inclinations were quick to distance themselves from the activities of the disorderly hordes, and to deny all responsibility for rousing the lawless multitude or stage-managing their terrorist attacks. One pamphleteer was horrified to hear such "unruly voices crye out upon popery", aggrieved to see hooligans and thugs who "feared neither God nor men" metamorphosed overnight into "professors of the Gospell, and detesters of Antichrist". Their providential and anti-Catholic zeal, in his opinion, was merely an effective cover for "rifling" and "spoile", a form of camouflage for under- hand criminal schemes.72 This was Puritanism born not of per- sonal regeneration nor a psychological struggle, but of hypocrisy, knavery and material greed. What we are observing, then, is an occasion on which the culture of festive licence and the culture of a militant brand of Calvinism briefly converged, a fleeting moment when a precarious (n. 69 cont.) the Lawes of Ecclesiastical Politie (London, 1604 edn, S.T.C. 13713), bk 4, p. 184: "Least (as a learned Protestant warnes them) under pretence of rooting out Popery, they bring extreme Barbarity into the Church". Nineteenth-century Catholic com- mentators perpetuated such opinions about the "Puritan mob": see, for instance, Records of the English Province, ed. Foley, i, p. 94. 70 See, for example, Ben Jonson, The Alchemist, I. i. 127-9, and Bartholomew Fair, V. v. 77-80, in Three Comedies, ed. Michael Jamieson (Harmondsworth, 1966). See also Henry B.

It adds weight to Peter Lake's argument that of late "we may have been seduced into taking too adversarial a view of the relationship between Puritanism and popular culture".74 If anti-Catholicism was a fundamental common denominator in post-Reformation religion, an ideological cement uniting the diverse strands within the Elizabethan and early Stuart Church, so too I suspect were shared assumptions about God's propensity to meddle directly in earthly affairs. Providentialism was possibly one more respect in which Protestantism, far from smothering and eradicating "superstition", helped in fact to sustain and intensify it, and to reinforce key elements of an older cosmology.75 Popular notions of the mechanisms by which divine justice worked and the eschatological significance of particular manifesta- tions of God's wrath probably only loosely overlapped and imper- fectly corresponded with the predestinarian doctrine expounded 73 Cf.

Many were apt to ignore the repeated warnings of their ministers about the evils of prying into God's unfathomable judgements and infer that the souls of individuals struck down in their prime were perpetually damned in hell. Those killed in the Blackfriars accident, remarked one foreign emissary, were adjudged "guilty even in death by the rabid opinion of the heretical multitude".76 The urban crowd apparently had little time for the intellectual equivocations of its clerical teachers. But for all these subtle discrepancies, the outlook of godly Protestants was by no means as incompatible with that of the ordinary people as is generally implied.77 III One legacy of a decade and a half of revisionist assessments of the impact and course of the English Reformation has been an enduring scepticism about the extent to which Protestantism, a religion forbiddingly abstract in its emphasis on the spoken and written word, could appeal to a generation whose cultural and ecclesiastical heritage was intensely visual. As Margaret Aston has shown, Calvinist ideology drove "a wedge of conscientious objection" between the graphic arts and spiritual experience, implanting in the logocentric psyche of many Protestants deep- seated inhibitions about the legitimacy of the pictorial medium. Increasingly rigorous and dogmatic application of the injunction against idolatry contained in the second commandment created an atmosphere which was not merely iconoclastic but, as Patrick Collinson has persuaded us, profoundly iconophobic. Protestants, it is argued, systematically extended the ban on image-making to preclude most forms of secular representation as well. 76 Calendar of State Papers, Venetian, xviii, p. 147. 77 With regard to the essential incompatibility of Protestantism and the religious mentality of the vast majority of the populace, see esp. Christopher Haigh, "The Church of England, the Catholics and the People", in Christopher Haigh (ed.), The Reign of Elizabeth I (Basingstoke, 1984), pp. 195-219.

As she has shown, the early seventeenth century in fact saw a major expansion in the London print-selling trade. It witnessed the emergence of a new interest in the craft of copper engraving, as well as the birth, or rather the resuscitation, of an older tradition of visual propa- ganda.79 This is the backdrop against which I want to place the dramatic print of the Blackfriars accident I introduced at the beginning (Plate 1), a picture dominated by a central providen- tial motif. Before unveiling it for a second inspection, something more should be said about the upsurge in the production of anti- Catholic art which marked the Jacobean period. The early English reformers were by no means hesitant about harnessing this medium for polemical objectives, for they enthusiastically bor- rowed and adapted the imaginative formulae and themes of the illustrated broadsheets that proliferated in Lutheran Germany. The scanty evidence we have seems to confirm Collinson's sugges- tion that the second-generation Calvinists who were their suc- cessors had far more misgivings. Their Stuart descendants, however, appear to have had rather fewer reservations about dabbling in this sphere. Although a mere handful of examples of this ephemeral genre survives, it is striking that nearly all the anti-Catholic cartoons in the British Museum's collection of satir- 78 Margaret Aston, England's Iconoclasts, i, Laws against Images (Oxford, 1988), p. vii; Patrick Collinson, From Iconoclasm to Iconophobia: The Cultural Impact of the Second English Reformation (Stenton Lecture 1985, Reading, 1986), pp. 22-6, quotation at p. 25; Patrick Collinson, The Birthpangs of Protestant England: Religious and Cultural Change in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (London, 1988), pp. 115-21.

This was an impression which some contemporary publicists were anxious to promote: in Thomas Scott's infamous Vox Populi, for instance, the character of the Spanish Ambassador, Gondomar, is made to admonish the English Jesuits and secular priests to spare no effort to buy up every copy of "scandalous" pictures which came out "to our prejudice", and to "burne them forthwith".81 Were such prints an attempt to counteract the pernicious effects of the "supersti- tious" Catholic images Protestants feared were infiltrating every corner of the land? Along with crucifixes, relics, rosaries and other such trumpery, "papisticall pictures" devised to captivate the simple were being exported and publicly displayed for sale, "with much outfacing and ostentation on their side". One member of the 1621 Parliament reported to the House of Commons that in Lancashire these items were "openly made and showed in the streets". Traditional icons of the holy family and the saints were not the sole focus of complaint: equally disturbing 80 See the chronological listing of prints in F. G. Stephens and M.

But to return to our present concern: an eye-catching repres- entation of the Blackfriars accident now in the possession of the British Museum. The work of an anonymous engraver, No Plot No Powder was marketed in single sheet form by a resourceful young Puritan book- and print-seller, Thomas Jenner, from his shop at London's Royal Exchange door. Jenner was a print-seller rapidly establishing a profitable trade in religious art to suit the tastes of the pious urban middle class, a godly entrepreneur who in the 1640s was to offer his professional services to the leaders of the Parliamentary cause.83 Though this engraving probably appeared only several months after the event, it left its viewers in no doubt whatsoever that the catastrophe on 26 October was an act of capital punishment executed by an implacably anti-Catholic deity. The artist has evoked in gratuitous detail the appalling spectacle of a divine judgement against the avowed enemies of the 82 Ibid.; Something Written, p. 17.

Its uncompromising inscription, "DIGITVS DEI HIC CONFV = ", only adds to the macabre effect. All around him masonry crumbles and monumental pillars topple, heavy timbers groan and then snap, crushing the richly attired evensong crowd - a far cry from the humble reality of a rickety garret overloaded with representat- ives of every rank and creed. The dismembered bodies of the Jesuit's auditors are placed at excruciating angles; their faces stare out bewildered and stunned. Some exclaim popishly in the midst of their ordeal "ora pro nobis (pray for us)". Others are clearly determined to desert the Church of Rome without further delay: their cartoon bubbles enclose terse anti-Catholic epigrams. "Masse is misery", one wails; "Ile go no more to masse", another fervently vows. At once emblematic and photographic, the cataclysmic scene is an arresting parody of the havoc wrought by Samson in the temple of his Philistine persecutors.

In view of their unmistakable stylistic affinities and compositional sym- metry, there can be little doubt that the three were originally issued as a series and designed to be contemplated in succession and side by side. These particular copies are specimens of different impressions made from recycled plates in varying states of simplification, deterioration and decay. Periodically revamped and republished, this seems to have been a extremely popular set of topical prints.87 First the eye of the beholder was to be confronted by a familiar tableau - the arch-traitor Guy Fawkes ("Faux"), equipped with a lantern and robed in a long flowing cloak, is providentially detected as he stealthily approaches the cellar under Parliament House and prepares to set a match to the barrels of gunpowder and explode his monarch and countrymen to smithereens. Next the curtain opens to reveal a scheming conclave of Jesuits seated around a square table littered with all manner of religious para- phernalia, conspiring by means of the Spanish match to bring England back into the Catholic fold and under the subjection of Philip IV. But in this theatre, the usual masks of comedy and tragedy have been replaced by gargoyles of the devil and a fiend- ish, triple-tiara'd pope, who urge on the villainous company below. And in the third act of this divine drama, truth is permitted to triumph once more: the perpetrators of plots with and with- out powder are violently surprised and overwhelmed. At "Blackefriars" in 1623 God has at last revenged the "Black Deeds" done in Westminster in 1605, and the "Black Breed" that clandestinely intrigued in Fetter Lane, Holborn, around 1620. As the swallow-tailed banners flying in the left and right corners of the triptych proclaim, there is neat poetic justice in the fact that the treachery of 5 November "Old Stile" should be requited on 5 November "New Stile". The caption carried across from Guy Fawkes's cloak to Robert Drury's surplice also clumsily (n. 86 cont.) 1605-1606". It is noted in Hind, Engraving in England, ii, p. 393 (no. 65). Another copy (of the same impression) survives in the Sutherland Collection of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (B. 1. 11). To my knowledge, the connection between the three prints has not previously been noticed. 87 am extremely grateful to Antony Griffiths, Keeper of the British Museum's Department of Prints and Drawings, for his advice and assistance on these technical matters. 68 NUMBER 144 PAST AND PRESENT</page><page sequence="34">"THE FATALL VESPER" 3.

On one level, they amount to nothing more than a vulgar anti-Catholic brag, a slogan of self-congratulation that the shady dealings of the papists behind closed doors will eventually be brought to light and punished in full public view: "This thou didst secretly, but I wil doe this before the sunne". But the scriptural context of this passage requires closer consideration. God speaks here through the prophet Nathan, delivering a chilling sentence against King David, who has committed adultery with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, and effectively murdered her husband by send- ing him to certain slaughter in battle: "Thus saith the Lord, behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine owne house".

Is it England's intended alliance with Antichrist, her licentious liaison with the Catholic Infanta, or the spirit of compromise with popery which was beginning to characterize government policy, which will likewise kindle the Lord's wrath? Are these prints a defiant final protest against the Spanish match, against dynastic and ecclesiastical pol- icies believed to be prostituting the integrity of the Protestant nation? Perhaps these engravings contained no such clever riddles and hidden political barbs. But even as an entirely conventional expression of popular anti-popery they were potentially inflam- matory. So the Ipswich preacher Samuel Ward had discovered to his cost two years earlier when he attempted to publish an equally impertinent cartoon in "memorye" of England's "double deliveraunce from the invincible Navie and the unmatcheable powder Treason". (Plate 6.) With the Habsburg marriage negoti- ations at a sensitive stage, it is no wonder that a print which depicted the intervention of providence - here symbolized by the Tetragrammaton (the Hebrew name for God) and the all- seeing eye, rather than by an anthropomorphic divine hand against the pope colluding with Satan and the Spanish king to contrive "some rare stratagem" by which "Great Brytanes State ruinate should bee" was construed as a personal insult to Philip IV. It was a tactless display of artistic talent which permanently tarnished Ward's reputation and blighted his subsequent career. Provoking a formal protest from Count Gondomar, this ingenious artefact manufactured in Amsterdam earned him an extended term in prison.89 In a petition to James I in the spring of 1622, (n. 88 cont.) consumere (consume, destroy), while confu= seems to call for a form of confundere (confuse, confound, perplex), both of which occur in a number of appropriate biblical texts (e.g., Num. 32:13, Ezek. 13:14, Gen. 11:7 (the Tower of Babel), Isa. 45:16). 89 Samuel Ward, Deo Trin-UniBritanniae bis ultori.

We can only speculate, but whoever was the driving force behind it must have been aware he was playing with fire - "inventing" provid- ential "monuments" had already proved to be fraught with polit- ical risk. Virulent anti-popery did enjoy something of an Indian summer after the fiasco of the Spanish match, but the interdict against it was all too soon renewed.93 IV It certainly seems more than a coincidence that Thomas Scott preached and published a sermon about the Blackfriars cata- strophe soon after it occurred. Having already incensed the authorities with half a dozen pamphlets reviling the projected Habsburg marriage and insisting upon the moral necessity of (n. 92 cont.) Samuel Ward's print inspired many copies and adaptations, including at least two in embroidery: see J. L. Nevinson, "English Domestic Embroidery Patterns of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries", Walpole Soc., xxviii (1939-40), p. 10 and plates VI(a) and (b); M. J. Rodriguez-Salgado et al., Armada, 1588-1988 (London, 1988), plate 16.32, p. 283. I have not been able to ascertain whether Ward originally invented this design, or whether he was simply juxtaposing pre-existing images which had already appeared independently, closer to the events to which they refer. Icon-like, paired salvation scenes, especially Faux's timely providential discovery, in combina- tion with the crescent Armada dispersed by a heaven-sent wind, were enduring iconographical themes: they reappear on the title-pages of Christopher Lever's The Historie of the Defendors of the Catholique Faith (London, 1627, S.T.C. 15537), engraved by Frederick Van Hulsen, and George Carleton's Thankfull Remembrance (1624 and later editions), engraved by William van de Passe. Versions of the "Powder Plot" were engraved to face the liturgy for 5 November in half a dozen octavo editions of the Book of Common Prayer in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries: see, for example, the editions of 1676, 1678 and 1711. John Sturt and G. L. Smith adapted this design for the same purpose in 1717 and 1787. It continued to be revived when fears of popery became acute, even as late as the early nineteenth century: see BM Satires, nos. 42-7, 64, and George, English Political Caricature, pp. 16-17, 63-4, 105. The motif of the cabal or conclave of conspirators was also of lasting influence: see, for instance, the royalist, anti-republican propaganda of [Edward Ward], The Whigs Unmask'd: Being the Secret History of the Calf's-Head Club, 9th edn (London, 1721), which has plates depicting the "Calve's Head Club", and "Olever Cromwells Cabinet Councell Discoverd" (a committee of regicides seated around a table and chaired by the devil), as well as the public destruction of Burgess's meeting-house in the Sacheverell riots. Strikingly, these pictures seem to bear the same relation to each other as the prints of the Jesuit conclave and the collapse of the Blackfriars' attic. I am grateful to Professor Collinson for bringing this to my attention. 93 It is difficult to date precisely the three prints, but their relationship to other contemporary images exploiting similar providential motifs strongly suggests some time in 1624, probably after the so-called "blessed revolution" in February - the rapprochement between the king and parliament over the question of foreign policy, which generated a flood of aggressively anti-Catholic publications.</page><page sequence="40">&lt;u rn ' m - N X ,, o Eo ro 0C g o Â§ .t 3 3 .Â» k.? lo b t \d Cu</page><page sequence="41">military intervention in the Thirty Years War, it is hardly surpris- ing that Scott took the precaution of entrusting his latest tirade against Antichrist to a Dutch press. For even without the stigma of his name on its cover, Digitus Dei is unlikely to have escaped censorship at home.94 Precisely where or when this diatribe was first delivered is still a mystery. Early in 1621, having "fore- notice of the pursevant", Scott had prudently fled, and he is known to have been in the Netherlands by the following year.95 Perhaps it was first heard at Utrecht where he served as chaplain to the English garrison stationed there, or by a congregation of exiled English Calvinists elsewhere in the Low Countries? Whichever the case, Digitus Dei reached a much larger invisible audience across the Channel, becoming incorporated in the col- lected edition of the Vox Populi tracts. Scott selected as his text Luke 13:5, "except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish", and proceeded to apply it to his "present purpose" - an uncompromising exposition of the religio-political significance of the recent tragedy. This so-called "accident", he declared, could not be satisfactorily explained by reference to the whims of Lady Fortune and her handmaid Chance: these were fabulous notions begotten by the "Dwarfe Ignorance" and the "Monster Atheisme".96 To say that God had no role in it was wicked and absurd. The calamity was indisputably a premeditated supernatural act, a consummation of biblical promises made in the infancy of the world: "We see what lately hath befalne the Sinagogue of Satan, the Temple of Baal, the Image of Dagon, the Sonnes of Antichrist, the Children of Babylon, who sought to bring all the Roman Idolatries, and Whorish Superstitions into the Land: how the Lord overwhelmed them, and brought upon them sodaine destruction, as he had long before threatned in his Word". Scott claimed to relate this catastrophe "not as a man that tooke delight in blood", but as one who bemoaned the loss of his "own deare Countrimen", lamenting their "obstinate blindnesse" in 94Thomas Scott, Exod. 8. 19.

Their allotted place in the predestinarian order, he emphasized, was "sealed up in seacret from us" until the Last Judgement - none should presume they were eternally doomed. But "this great work" of God's justice was nevertheless to be blazoned abroad, not whitewashed and covered up. This was "a notorious Sacrelige", and "Prince, Priest, and People", he warned, would "pay for the concealement by some severe and strickt Inquisition".97 Scott considered this providential disaster all the "more remar- 97 Ibid., pp. 21-2. 77</page><page sequence="43">keable" for "being done upon them who stand upon Miracles, for the confirmation of their falsehoods", especially when they prated of "restauration" and expected "an Omen of good lucke" and encouragement instead, to "reestablish them in the common mans conceit". God in effect had pre-empted the announcement of the royal pardon which Catholics so vainly paraded as a fait accompli. He had made a mocking spectacle of a religion grounded on pretence and deceit, a faith that taught its adherents "to commit Spirituall Fornication under the shew of Sanctitie and Holinesse" and played with "the Word and Sacraments in a most Anticke or Apish fashion". It was therefore entirely fitting that the unmasking of Antichrist should be next to take centre stage in the theatre of his judgements. This illegal chapel was as lewd and profane as the playhouses nearby; its fall bore comparison with the collapse of stands full of bear-baiting fans one Sunday at Paris Garden exactly forty years before.98 The harsh discipline dealt out to their "Brethren in the Black- Fryars" should compel all Catholics to acknowledge that Rome was the Babylonish whore spoken of in the book of Revelation, and convince them of the wisdom of hearkening to God's call to "Come out of her my People that ye be not partakers of her sinnes, and that ye receive not of her plagues".99 Scott gave free rein to his viciously satirical tongue in arguing that the accident exposed the impotence of Catholic ecclesiastical magic: none of their "toyes" and "trash" - idols, crosses, talismans or Agnus Dei - had shielded the superstitious laity from this lethal blow. This should open the eyes of these "bewitched Customers" and "abate the price and esteeme" of such worthless "merchandize". Furthermore, "[t]heir Saints and tutelar Angels . . . were verie negligent in their cures and charges". And "[w]hat", he scoffed, "became of those Wafer-cakes which the Priest had before turned into gods . . .What were all of them brayned with the Timber and Brickbats .. .?" Unless false witnesses could be hired to say they had seen the "consecrated Cakes rise alone from under the ruines", none would ever believe in the error of transubstantiation again - "except such as you with the Cup of Abhominations have transubstantiated or transformed Spiritually . . . into such Don Quixshots or Gorgantuahs as would eat up their God 98 Ibid., pp. 22, 24-5. 99 Ibid., pp. 39, 41, 43 (quoting from Rev. 18:4). 78 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 144</page><page sequence="44">"THE FATALL VESPER" Almightie at a mouthfull, or in their melancholly mood imagine themselves to be such Monsters as could doe it".100 Scott's anti-popery was unusually scurrilous, but nothing quoted above departs very drastically from the remarks made in pamphlets licensed for the press. What was dangerous was the way in which he teased out the seditious implications inherent in his position. Scott asserted that it was "the silence of all men at that time and in that action" that had provoked God "to speake and to doe" - the tacit and universal sanction given to the current "encrochments of Antichrist". He vigorously rebuked those who had held their peace for fear of being "counted factious, furious, and hot-headed fellowes" and rendered ineligible for "preferment and imployment": "neither shall they escape the Hand of God, but he will find them out, and punish their falshood and faintnesse in his cause".101 Scott detected this kind of Laodicean lukewarmness in official reluctance to implement the recusancy laws, in the crypto-popery creeping into "the heart and bosome" of the Stuart court and state, in the pro-Catholic character of domestic religious policy - not to mention long- term dynastic plans.102 It was not the "sodaine reentrance of Antichrist" that must be guarded against, but "his slye insinu- ation", and "their wiles who pretend to worke reconcilement, and say that humour is too much stird upon both sides". Backsliding towards Rome, accepting "the least marke of the Beast which we have long cast off, therby to buy our peace, and to endeare our entertainment", was "to sinne with a high Hand against the Light of Knowledge", the Holy Ghost.103 As the suppression in August 1624 of Thomas Middleton's A Game at Chesse revealed, the expression of savagely anti-Catholic and anti-Spanish sentiments was still considered to be internation- ally indiscreet. It is worth remembering that this was a context in which, even after the exhilaration at Prince Charles's return, rumours about his marriage to the Infanta Maria continued to fester and spread.104 Scott had the added temerity to redirect his 100 Ibid., pp. 19, 26-7; cf.

Digitus Dei was just one symptom of the extent to which preach- ing became politicized in the Jacobean period. During the early 1620s, a string of clergymen had been imprisoned or severely reprimanded for deploring James's pacific foreign policy from prominent London pulpits - not least Paul's Cross. Godly minis- ters who adopted a hard line against Rome, particularly with an apocalyptic or hispanophobic twist, were angrily muzzled - few of these incendiary sermons passed into print. In August 1622, only two days after the suspension of the recusancy laws, the king took even sharper measures, issuing directions to restrain the "abuses and extravagances" that abounded in contemporary preaching, outlawing discussion of matters of state and "deep" theological doctrines like predestination, as well as all "bitter invectives and indecent railings" against the Catholic faith.105 But as Anthony Milton's important forthcoming book will reveal, these efforts to curb anti-papal rhetoric were indicative of a more gener- ally repressive trend. The devaluation of impassioned polemic against Antichrist was one tell-tale sign of the changing ideological temper of the episcopal hierarchy. The aggressive anti-popery that had been the bread and butter of mainstream Elizabethan preachers came to be regarded as one of the outrageous excesses of a deviant sectarian fringe. It came to be associated exclusively with that segment of contemporary society which an ascendant Arminianism was tarring with brush of "Puritanism", unortho- doxy and schism. Once the rallying-cry of a consensually Calvinist Church - an accepted means by which moderate Puritans could demonstrate their fidelity and conformity to the establishment while affirming their commitment to further ecclesiological reform - anti-Catholicism grew into a major source of religious conten- 105 See P.R.O., S.P. 14/118/39, 120/13, 122/46, 123/105, 129/35 and 36, 153/20 and 38; Brit.

The opportunities it afforded to criticize the new "popish" virus infecting the Church of England eliminated it as a sphere of discourse into which radical Protestant zeal could safely be channelled.106 A similar shift can be discerned in relation to providential preaching. Fire and brimstone denunciations of God's judgements on the iniquitous English nation were the staple fare of Elizabethan sermon gadders. Assuming the mantle of the Old Testament prophets, Protestant ministers of all persuasions thun- dered out well-worn themes - they predicted the divine punish- ments that would overtake a people as "froward", incorrigible and "stiff necked" as the Jews, analysed the ominous signs of the times, and identified the particular transgressions that were hau- ling down supernatural plagues from heaven. Until perhaps the 1620s, this was a paradigm that tended to underwrite rather than undermine the existing order: it was moral and social failings, rather than political shortcomings, which were considered to be the bane of the land. Thereafter, the "scapegoat" sins deemed to be infuriating the Almighty were of a distinctly less innocuous type.107 Bravely, late Jacobean preachers began to attribute past and impending catastophes to England's evasion of her responsib- ility to relieve her afflicted Protestant cousins abroad and royal hesitation to take action to recover the Palatinate, to the scandal of the Spanish match and the government's connivance at the idolatry committed by its Catholic subjects. Outrage about the persons and institutions countenancing violations of divine law, moreover, started to eclipse and outweigh indignation against the offenders themselves. The clergy became less preoccupied with individual papists than with the public bodies turning a blind eye 106 Anthony Milton, Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600-1640 (Cambridge, forthcoming).

The rehearsal of these mercies in anniversary sermons and other books of remembrance became distasteful and embarrassing to an ecumenically minded Arminian regime. Patriotic providentialism took on an increas- ingly strident and partisan tone: popular festive practices incurred official displeasure, and Puritans who used such occasions to emphasize the hazards of relapsing into popish superstition, or to condemn the liturgical innovations introduced by Laudian prelates, were relentlessly persecuted and harassed.109 The "fatall vesper" of 26 October 1623 was itself assimilated into this controversial historical tradition. Elevated to the status of a sacred date in the epic tale of Protestant England's victory over popery, the episode acquired lasting and semi-mythical sig- nificance. When Theodore Hering preached in the parish church of St Anne, Blackfriars, in 1625 it was hardly necessary to remind the community he addressed of the providential disaster that had happened on its doorstep just two years before: "Witnesse this day of dayes", he exhorted his hearers, "on the morning of our fifth of November, they would have blowne us up; on the evening 108 To give only a few examples: Thomas Gataker, A Sparke toward the Kindling of Sorrow for Sion (London, 1621, S.T.C. 11675), esp. pp. 36-9; Thomas Jackson, Judah Must into Captivitie.

It numbered among the examples of "Gods heavi Judgements on Sabbath breakers" pri- vately compiled by the London artisan Nehemiah Wallington, who enlisted the downfall of this impious conventicle for a new Puritan agenda - as further proof of divine rage at the Caroline reissue of the 1617 Book of Sports.114 Thomas Fuller assigned the "dolefull even-song" a prominent place in his influential Church-History of Britain, published during the Interregnum in 1655, and it continued to appear in encyclopaedic anthologies of providences like Samuel Clarke's Mirrour or Looking-Glasse both for Saints, and Sinners.115 Indeed, in 1657 Clarke appended a narrative of this seemingly indelible event to his England's Remembrancer - a cheap duodec- imo tract recounting the "never to be forgotten deliverances" of '88 and 1605. He pirated William Gouge's report of the accident and added a crude fold-out copy of the No Plot No Powder print. (Plate 8.)

Subsequently something of a classic, Clarke's chap- book sought, in effect, to inject providentialism artificially into popular culture. Perhaps, however, it already had a tenacious grip on the early modern imagination."17 * * * It is becoming conventional to argue that anti-Catholicism repres- ented a region of ideological common ground between the self- styled minority of "perfect" Protestants and the vast mass of "the people".118 Providentialism, this essay has implicitly sug- gested, might be viewed in a similar light. It was an assortment of habits of thought that at least had the potential to be absorbed and integrated into the new theological framework of post- Reformation predestinarianism. It permits us a glimpse of the rough and irregular interface between clerically prescribed Calvinist religiosity and the mentality of sections of lay society awkwardly, if not improperly, aligned with the "godly" elite - at least in the context of late Jacobean London. Far from a set of bizarre phobias and irrational beliefs, providentialism, like anti-popery, could on occasion operate as a coherent and unifying force. But, as we have seen, it could also contribute to the creation 116 Samuel Clarke, Englands Remembrancer, Containing a True and Full Narrative of those Two Never to Be Forgotten Deliverances: The One from the Spanish Invasion in Eighty Eight: The Other from the Hellish Powder Plot: November 5. 1605.

Indeed by the third decade of the seventeenth century, providence, as a concept, was no longer politically benign. The language, interpretation and application of God's judgements were generating conflict and exacerbating divisions at the highest levels of church and state. The exponents of its more inflexible and revolutionary forms were finding themselves progressively marginalized from the early Stuart establishment.
