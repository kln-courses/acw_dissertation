<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Philosophical Quarterly Volume 23, Number 1, January 1986 THEODICY AND THE STATUS OF ANIMALS Frederick Ferr? TPHERE are today many theistic environment * alists, a large proportion of whom may assume that their belief in a creator-God of perfect goodness and their commitment to the moral considerability of animals are coherent and mutually reinforcing positions. This assumption is ill-grounded. The actual situation is one of deep tension. It may require a redrawing of our ethical maps and a reform in traditional doctrines of God before this tension can be overcome. Such reforms may be worth the effort, however, if theists are to be spared the need to choose between their acknowledgment of the "dignity of nature"1 and their faith in the goodness of God. I One of the hardest problems for theists?not only on the intellectual level but also at the affective level of living belief?has been to deal with the age-old problem of evil. Why do the righteous suf? fer? The Psalmist as well as the philosopher have reflected on this heartfelt query, and often there has been no answer to give comfort to the heart or satisfy the mind. The ancient author's warning to Job (out of the whirlwind), that he should piously withdraw the question in the face of the awesome power of the creator,2 may cause the issue to be humbly laid aside, but it is certainly no answer for the philosopher. There may be one line of response to the problem of evil, however, that has a chance of reasonable success. This promising line is grounded on the premise that pain and suffering?through prima facie evils?are not in themselves absolute evils, but sometimes are morally legitimated by larger ends that necessitate and thereby justify them. The unavoidable pains that a dentist inflicts are war? ranted, for example, in the interests of health. If so, what could qualify analogously as such a theologically justifying end?one that might con ceivably exonerate even God's permitting the Nazi Holocaust? The answer could consist (so the argu? ment runs) in nothing less than some goal of bound? less worth. This divine goal is the gradual bringing into being of the Kingdom of God: i.e., God's patient nurturing of responsible and finally fulfil? ling relationships among free rational agents and between himself and his Kingdom. This one suffi? ciently justifying goal, in other words, would be the formation of a morally mature community of ends-in-themselves whose members have learned at first-hand to overcome their struggles with temp? tation, ignorance, and despair. Among the necessary conditions for God's achieving this goal, however, would be (1) that he keep hidden to allow the acts of such agents to be uncoerced by his majesty and power; (2) that he permit these uncoerced acts sometimes to be evil as well as good; and (3) that he allow the evil as well as the good acts to have genuine consequences. God's ultimate end for creation would not be satis? fied by the manufacture of puppets capable of doing only good, or by the overawing of rationally cal? culating creatures who could, if all were clear, see that following the divine moral law is merely a matter of long-run self-interest. The only way, that is, for God to create such a Kingdom of moral companions, in any possible world, would be to allow both pain and ambiguity, evil and ignorance, predictability and precariousness3 through which finite free persons created to be members of his Kingdom could find their own way, by moral growth, from the dust of the earth to the final status of Sons and Daughters of God. If this world is not intended by God to be a hedonist's paradise but, rather, a "vale of soul-mak? ing,"4 it becomes plausible to hold that whatever is logically necessitated for this supremely valuable end is morally justified. God's perfect power and goodness may then despite all appearances be com 23</page><page sequence="2">24 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY patible with the anguish and mystery of this world. So concludes the deep-rooted and understandably popular "Free Will Defense" of God's goodness against the presence of otherwise radically inexplic? able suffering. Such a line of reasoning has the great advantage, not of attempting to explain in any detail the apparent injustices of the world, but of offering a general account of why there should be any such evils and ambiguities at all: viz., as serious consequences of the misuse of freedom, as moral stimuli for responsible agents, and as the pedagogical context for our continued moral growth as rational persons. Especially when this Free Will Defense is combined with traditional expectations of further existence beyond this life for the souls of those persons who have been treated unfairly in their earthly existence or who have not had an adequate opportunity to grow toward God's ulti? mate goal, both the anguish and the intellectual puzzlement of the problem of evil are to a consid? erable degree relieved. This is a thoughtful and honorable defense of the theist's intellectual right to maintain belief in the full goodness and competence of God despite the horrors that fill the pages of human history. Unfortunately, the justifying grounds on which it rests are all based on distinctively human traits; thus the greater its success in magnifying the impor? tance of free agency, morally responsible commu? nity, and the immortal soul, the less its capacity for interpreting, in the order of things ordained by God, the place of animals. The more the Free Will Defense accents justification of God's ways in His? tory , the less it can understand his work in Nature. One of the more attractive recent presentations of the Free Will Defense, George Wall's Is God Really GoodV illustrates both the strengths and weaknesses that must concern theistic environmen? talists. Wall does an excellent job in laying out his case for sophisticated theodicy. First, he does not claim deductive certainty for his case, or even that the believer in a perfect God has a more plausible case than his critics; he claims only that the Free Will Defense can be deployed in such a way that the theist can continue his belief in an all-powerful and all-good God no less plausibly than in any other rival position.6 The burden of proof to that extent becomes lighter and the position more modest than other theodicies, like that (say) of Leib? niz7; but for the theist who wants only the assurance that his faith is not contrary to responsible reason? ing, this more limited claim is enough. Second, he shows the incomparably greater moral values entailed by free agents over puppets. And, third, he argues skillfully for the logical necessity of God's hiddenness, or the presence of "ambiguity" throughout God's creation, for the sake of genuine finite freedom. Thus far, Wall's argument seems to carry him far, given his modest initial goals, perhaps as far as any theodicy should hope to go. The rest of Wall's argument,8 however, is likely to disturb a theist whose consciousness has been awakened to the claims made on behalf of the nat? ural order for a share of "dignity" or intrinsic value. Wall's argument leads, as a clear and honorable consequence of his defense of God's goodness in nurturing human freedom, to sharply minimizing the importance of animal suffering. His argument may be right. There is nothing malicious about it. Theists may need to accept it, in the end. But for environmentalists it is disturbing; and it may be that Wall himself has not seen how disturbing it could be if carried to its final conclusion. The argument is constructed from familiar and plausible parts. First it points out that animals are not on the same level of awareness as are humans, and therefore that their suffering is qualitatively much less intense.9 In the animal world, for exam? ple, there is no foresight of pains yet to come, and there is no self-consciousness or moral agency. Thus there can be neither the anxieties nor the guilts which fill to such a level the cup of human pain. Again, as also eloquently and correctly pointed out by William Paley ,10 Wall notes that pain is a biolog? ical advantage and a good thing on the whole. Animal death, too, is not a serious evil, but "only marginally evil at worst,"11 since the primary sting of death (for humans) is the breaking of relation? ships; but because animals are incapable of the depth of relationships normal for human life, the sting of animal death "is reduced to little more than a pin-prick."12 The loss even to themselves is not to be exaggerated. Their lives are repetitious, are limited in ranges of satisfaction, showing no indi? cation of higher aesthetic interests (even in the higher animals like the dog "which just sniffs our</page><page sequence="3">THEODICY AND THE STATUS OF ANIMALS 25 Degas..."13), and are lacking in moral ideals. Not only that, but we must recognize that in fact we do not take animal suffering very seriously, as Wall points out. It can hardly be considered a major count against God that he allows a world like this one when, after all, we ourselves shift animals around at will, breaking their "relationships" without thought and mating specimens by our choice on farms as in zoos and pet shops. We kill animals at our convenience and for our appetites, and we do not always kill kindly. Wall humorously chides those who would indignantly take animal suffering as a weighty objection against God's order of nature while relishing animal flesh at dinner. The many millions of years of animal life on earth prior to human history, with all the bloody feeding and being fed upon that evolution entailed, do not pose a problem for the theodicist who rec? ognizes the need for deep cosmic ambiguity (for the sake of human cognitive and moral freedom) and, finally, who frankly acknowledges the superiority of human values.14 Everything comes down to that superiority in the end, Wall recog? nizes. Otherwise we should have to have a bad conscience not only at eating meat but also at killing for the sake of aesthetics?as we exterminate gophers and moles for the beauty of our lawns.15 Human values simply outweigh the value of ani? mals. Thus, Wall concludes: "if you're going to take animal life seriously, you're going to have to alter your lifestyle radically."16 This position is not wicked or thoughtless, and it is hard to hold that it is less "plausible" in its frank anthropocentrism than the environmentalist's wider sense of ethical considerability. Perhaps, given the actual state of contemporary values?to which Wall appeals?his view is actually more plausible than the environmentalist's minority pos? ition that animals ought not to be treated as things only, subject to being subordinated entirely to human interests or pleasures. But it is important that theistic environmentalists for whom Wall's position is not acceptable, and who may indeed be willing to "alter their lifestyles radically," clearly face the possible dilemma before them: if God's goodness, despite the reality of human suffering, is to be vindicated by the Free Will Defense, then it seems that animal suffering must be dismissed as trivial. But if animal pain is to be given signif? icant moral weight, then it seems that the problem of evil cannot be relieved by appeals to considera? tions, like freedom and moral responsibility, that are applicable primarily or exclusively to human beings. Some sensitive theistic thinkers, to be sure, have speculated about the possibility of multiple reincar? nations for animal souls, to bring them all eventu? ally up to the human level of moral responsibility and personal freedom,17 but such speculations, though perhaps offering a logical possibility of escape from the dilemma, seem far from "plausi? ble." Instead they appear ad hoc metaphysical methods of administratively promoting animals to the place where the Free Will Defense can again save the day for God's perfection. Short of this, however, and apart from the impos? sibly strained hypothesis that animals are already, somehow, humans in furry disguise, fully equipped with moral responsibility, free will, guilt, and immortal souls, it would seem that theists who wish to retain rationally responsible trust in the perfect goodness and power of God through the Free Will Defense must turn their backs, morally, on the animal world. This is what George Wall's argu? ment, thoughtfully but decisively, recommends. Once one's back is turned, however, it is hard to know what is happening or how to criticize at all. Shall sensitive theists withdraw all objection to every sort of vivisection?18 It is always per? formed, when it is done, in the name of human interests more vital than smooth lawns, for the sake of which gophers and moles are in good conscience to be poisoned, trapped, or shot. Indeed, what can be said against "blood sports" like bullfighting or cockfighting, so long as human beings actually enjoy it enough to take an interest? Are these not the consequences of unambiguously affirming, with Wall's Free Will Defense, the "superiority of human values"? If not, where shall the theist, or any concerned thinker, draw the line, and on what grounds? Shall it be merely on the Kantian ground19 that cruelty to animals (which cannot in itself, for Kant, be a moral problem) may contingently encourage cruelty to human beings, the only beings who, on Kant's theory, possess the dignity of ends in themselves? But it is surely asking too much to</page><page sequence="4">26 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY expect any environmentalist, theist or otherwise, to conclude that cruelty to animals in itself is not at all a moral problem. If we have no moral need to hold the interests and sensitivities of animals in genuine respect, and if God himself must be supposed to have created them as means only, then?for the theistic environ? mentalist, at least?environmental conscience has finally been sacrificed to the demands of theological argumentation. For such a theist, the vision of such a God?supposed to have created in profusion ani? mals sensitive to pain but outside the range of divine respect or concern?is not the vision of a perfect, or even a good, God. The Free Will Defense has turned on itself and condemned theodicy to failure. II If we are to avoid the foregoing dilemma of theodicy, a sustained attempt to escape from the anthropocentric bias in ethical thought seems required. Accounting for the problem of human suffering in terms of divine ends applicable only to human persons requires the minimizing of animal worth and?at least for theists who are also environ? mentalists?an unacceptable diminishing of the concepts of divine love and justice by restricting their effective scope to human history. James M. Gustafson's recent work20 speaks to at least part of this need. In the first volume of his distinguished Ethics from a Theocentric Perspec? tive, Gustaf son explores in detail what would be involved in the thoroughgoing renunciation of anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism from theistic ethical thought. The crucial questions for Gustaf son underscore exactly what, from the environmentalist's point of view, has been missing from the traditional approach. What happens if what is right for man requires that we see that man is rightly related not only to other persons, not only to social institutions and their rela? tions to each other, but to the elements of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon so necessary as conditions for life itself, to worlds of plants and animals, and even to the inanimate features of our planet?21 To adopt the point of view that God, not man, is the measure of all things is the "theocentric perspec tive" that reveals what our anthropocentric blinders tend to hide form us. Once this theocentric perspec? tive is adopted, anthropocentric epistemological pretensions and ethical assurances must also be dropped. Epistemologically, Gustaf son asserts: "The operations of the human mind do not neatly correspond with the structure and processes of ulti? mate reality."22 And ethically, once man is removed from the center of the moral universe, human judg? ments of value will no longer count as the measure of God's righteousness. Gustaf son notes that, as in the story of God's command to Abraham to kill his innocent son, "we are deeply disturbed when a divine command is not in accord with the precepts of common human morality.... We are morally offended when the will of God runs counter to our human understanding of what is right and good for man, and in this case for a particular innocent human child, Isaac."23 But the theocentric perspec? tive requires that we give up the comfortable assumption "that the good for human beings coin? cides with the ultimate divine purpose."24 One of the immediate consequences of adopting this theocentric perspective will be to see that the problem of evil no longer arises in the traditional way, and theodicy is therefore no longer called for. As Gustafson puts it: The statement of the issue has, I believe, always assumed that God or the gods had to be moral as the "moral" was defined by human beings. The problem of theodicy itself assumes this principle.25 That wider context, indeed, need not strain for ways to show that God is always aiming for the moral best as we see it, or for the benefit of his creatures, human or otherwise. ...[T]he divine governance through nature is not necessarily beneficent, it is limiting; it indicates the relative powerlessness of human beings in such drastic events. But it is not necessarily good for anything or for anyone.26 The only end that the theocentric perspective would attribute to God's creation of the world would be "God's glorification of himself,"27 and even that would be with careful qualification of the anthropomorphic linguistic suggestion that God somehow "intends" anything. "To say that God</page><page sequence="5">THEODICY AND THE STATUS OF ANIMALS 27 intends to glorify himself through the creation requires an assurance that he has this capacity for intention and volition," Gustafson cautions, "that I believe cannot be sustained."28 The "personalistic metaphor"29 for God has cer? tain practical values, in encouraging human beings (who may think themselves reflected in the "image" ofthat which they are anthropomorphically imagin? ing) to take responsibility for their own actions by analogy to God's supposed "agency." But Gustaf? son, mistrusting such anthropocentric concepts, has little confidence in "the agency model of God."30 Piety may attribute personal traits to the God of Jesus "whom he called Father,"31 but piety of that sort has too often been exploited for its instrumental subjective satisfactions. What we gain from the theocentric perspective can be stated both theologically and ethically. First, theologically, we are freed from the nagging demands of theodicy by the recognition that God's ways are not to be measured by our standards of benevolence. And we are freed from the thirsts of petty egocentricity that finally drive the traditions of "cheap grace" and human happy endings. In return we obtain a high and noble vision of the universe, in which humanity has a respected place but not the central role. Everything, indeed, that God created has a respected place. The satisfaction of theocentric religion of this sort is in the mature satisfaction of accepting one's finitude but also one's limited place within the whole, and in affirming with reverence and awe the powers that "bear down on us and sustain us." Second, ethically, we are offered a new moral imperative: "we are to relate to all things in a manner appropriate to their relations to God."32 That is, we need to put our purposes and interests under the judgment of the whole, seen from the divine point of view: Human purposes and human conduct have to be evaluated not simply on the basis of considerations derived from reflection about what is good for man. Rather, reflection is needed on how human life is to be related to a moral ordering objective to our species.33 For the theistic environmentalist, the enlargement of the moral and religious perspective urged by Gustafson is exactly what was lacking in the earlier tradition presupposed by the Free Will Defense. Gustafson has thus spoken to the difficult process of redrawing our ethical maps to a different scale, with new territories included. There are, however, two major dimensions on which Gustafson's development of the theocentric perspective, in my view, must be questioned. One of these involves certain logical points concerning his doctrine of God; the other his prescription for ethics. First, regarding God, the epistemological situa? tion is briefly set with the assurance from Gustafson that "the operations of the human mind do not neatly correspond with the structure and processes of ultimate reality."34 From this premise it follows that we cannot in principle know God as she/it/he is but can only represent her/it/him to our minds through symbols and analogies. Given the inadequacy of human cognition, it will be impos? sible in principle to compare the ultimate reality with any such symbolic representations, and there? fore our grounds for accepting some models as better and some as worse will need to be of a different sort. Gustafson brings himself, as we saw, to allow that there can be some moral benefit to allowing the "personalistic metaphor" for God.35 But Gus? tafson shows himself, throughout his book, much more concerned about the abuses?religious and ethical?that have arisen from allowing such per? sonalistic metaphors. He himself rejects their use. He simply has no confidence in the "agency model of God,"36 even for the language of piety. Likewise he rejects the attribution of "intelligence" or "will" or "intentions" to God. It follows, as well, that Gustafson has no place in his theory for God's love. The concept is hardly mentioned, except to dismiss it,37 and he does not even attempt to translate it, as he does certain other terms from the historic Christian tradition, into other non-personalistic terms.38 For the theistic environmentalist whose theological starting-place was a concern for the co-credibility of a perfectly loving Creator and an intrinsically valuable Crea? tion, this entails abandonment rather than solution of a central element in the initial problem. If George Wall's position seems to lead to the minimizing of interest in the inherent values of creation, James</page><page sequence="6">28 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Gustafson's seems to lead to abandonment of con? cern for the moral perfection of the Creator. We have still found no release from the deep tensions with which we began. Gustafson's approach to theodicy, indeed, removes the problem of evil only by retreating from claims about the goodness?more, from the entire moral status39?of God. God should not be rep? resented as "intelligent" or as exercising "will" or having "intentions" in any anthropomorphic sense; nor should he be considered "good" according to any human standard or meaning of that word. Gus? tafson rejects the "egocentric predicament that creates the problem of theodicy; for the theodicy question arises only on the assumption that God necessarily wills the good of a particular person or community as that good is humanly understood. "^ One must ask, however, whether there remains to human beings any meaning at all for "good" (or any other words) that are not "humanly under? stood." Gustafson's rejection of the anthropomor? phic language of intelligence, will, agency, inten? tions, personhood, goodness, or morality in refer? ence to God has systematically evacuated these terms, if used in connection with the divine, of any meaning they might have had. If the problem of theodicy is to be dissolved merely by refraining from language about the good? ness, love, morality, intentions, and intelligence of God (a tack that theological skeptics have always had available), then there seems little left that religious affection can find worthy of worship. Bleak power to "bear down on us" may elicit awe, perhaps, in the ways that can be stirred by a typhoon or an erupting volcano. But part?for many the most important part?of the evolution of religious affection over the centuries has been the slow achievement of the moralizing of the mysterium tremendum,41 emergent from the terror of the taboo to the universal Father in Heaven. This moralization of the concept of the holy does indeed depend upon a humanly understandable con? cept of "good" and "right," since all human thinking so depends. But must a human understanding of "good" always be identical with an understanding of "what is good" for humans (alone)? This is the equation that drives Gustafson to reject the entire language of goodness with reference to God. He assumes that such language, applied to the divine, will always reduce God to being merely instru? mental to human "goods": to benefits and interests of the selfish, necessarily species-oriented sort. There is no logical necessity, however, that "good" be defined as "beneficial to the human species." Moore's "Open Question" argument42 could always without absurdity be raised: "Granted it is beneficial to the human species, but is it goodV Gustafson's important insight is that God's goodness cannot, without offensive reductionism, be equated with a concern for such a limited meaning of "good." This is what the environmentalist responds to with enthusiasm in theocentric ethics. But for the theistic environmentalist, the rejection of goodness in any understandable sense for God is likely to be a price too high to pay. It would purchase a theocentric perspective at the cost of a theos unworthy of ethical respect, much less heartfelt worship. Finally, regarding ethics, the toll exacted by Gus? tafson's excessive qualms about anthropomorphic language in morality, seems too high. If "good" and "right" are not allowed their normal (human) meanings in connection with God, then it is hard to know what use the words retain for the assess? ment and regulation of human conduct. Normally it is admitted that pain is a non-moral evil which, all other things being equal, ought not to be inflicted on entities capable of feeling it. It is not an absolute evil, since there can be morally justifying reasons for creating or allowing it. The dentist, the surgeon, the parent, and others, all may have good reasons for dealing in pain for the sake of a worthy end. But it is a prima facie disvalue which, when encountered, needs justifying. In the words of C. S. Lewis: If we find a man giving pleasure it is for us to prove (if we criticize him) that his action is wrong. But if we find a man inflicting pain it is for him to prove that his action is right. If he cannot, he is a wicked man.43 By the same token, a God found guilty of callous, no-way-justified infliction of pain on humans or on other sensitive creatures for whose condition he is ultimately responsible, would be a wicked God. To escape this conclusion without providing a jus? tification "in human terms," Gustafson minimizes</page><page sequence="7">THEODICY AND THE STATUS OF ANIMALS 29 the motive behind the problem of theodicy, calling it grounded only in "egocentric" or human subjec? tive desires and aversions. It is true that pain is as felt a "subjective" disvalue. Does this mean that we should abandon the attempt to sympathize with the pains of others or to empathize with the suffer? ings of sensitive creatures belonging to other species than our own? If so, the application to the problems of the biosphere of the "theocentric per? spective," once it is "cleansed" of the material ethical content provided by our most basic human intuitions of value and dis value, will be empty indeed. Excessive appeal to anthropocentric values, when combined with a strong respect for a morally significant status of animals, seems to undermine the Free Will Defense of the goodness of God; excessive horror of anthropomorphic language seems to be the crucial defect of the theocentric perspective, at least in the depersonalized and mor? ally neutralized interpretation of God's nature and purposes that we have been offered. Is there some way in which the human, the natural, and the divine may be related without such tensions and dichotomies? Ill If the quest for coherence between environmental conscience and belief in a loving God is to succeed, the basis for moral community needs to be extended outward from the too-narrow anthropocentric domain in not just one but two directions. The tradition behind Wall's Free Will Defense tends to allow such moral community between the human and the divine, but it turns its back on the animals. The theocentric perspective urged by Gustafson enlarges theological vision to include all creation, but it gives up the sense of moral community with ultimate reality. 1. Humanity and the animals. The proper starting place for an adequate recognition of the status of animals is in the concreteness of evolutionary his? tory. For hundreds of thousands of years, mankind and animals have lived in social relationships of the closest sorts. Not merely as predator and prey, not alone as breeder and herder, but also as compan? ions, colleagues, and even friends, humans and animals have related from the earliest days until the present. Even today remnants remain: the shepherd and his dog; the nomad (or cow puncher) and his horse; the householder and her cats; the family farmer and his sheep and cows and pigs and chickens?all live together and interact in social ways that respect the differences among the species and also the many points of similarity and com municability. If it were not for the latter, the phenomenon of domestication, for example, would never have been possible. As Mary Midgley puts the matter: It is one of the special powers and graces of our species not to ignore others, but to draw in, domesticate and live with a great variety of other creatures. No other animal does so on anything like so large a scale. Perhaps we should take this peculiar human talent more seriously and try to understand its workings.44 If we do take the age-old phenomenon of what Midgley calls "the mixed community"45 seriously, we find that the project of redrawing of our ethical maps to include a larger range of ethically consid? erable creatures than human beings alone reveals not a strange new world but landscapes of family and farmyard life familiar throughout the vastly greater part of human history. Boys successfully communicate with their dogs and romp with them, work with them, scold them, sympathize with their hurts, rejoice in their hunting triumphs, weep at their death. Horse riders know the personalities of their animals?what makes them frightened, what tempts them, what makes them sulk?and relate to their steeds accordingly. Human beings have nor? mally taken for granted that in their social relations with animals they are dealing with other entities in many respects much like themselves as well as distinctly different. There is no practical doubt that, in the wild as well as in domesticity, animals, appropriately to their species, see and hear and feel pain,46 that they look for food, try to hide, pursue each other, establish truces, are more or less clever, court one another, intend to trap, try to escape, defend their young, stake out territory, warn of danger, grieve over loss, tease, and play. These are not metaphorical uses of words. There is no need to use quotation marks around "see" and "hear," for example, when used in connection with</page><page sequence="8">30 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY animals. Taking care lest the deer being hunted come to see or hear the hunter is the very context in which the earliest origins of the concept of sight and hearing are to be found. Similarly, it is not a metaphorical extension of human language to say that a tiger cub is teasing his mother and that she responds to his play tolerantly. These are among the primary, not secondary, uses of our words for "tease," "respond," "play," and "tolerant." In the same way it is logically mistaken to classify terms relevant to the personal vocabulary as somehow stretched or figurative merely because they may be used outside the human context. To say that a grizzly bear in the neighborhood is hungry and on the lookout for our camp supplies is not an extended use of speech. Nor would it be stretching language to warn that she may also be angry. "Anger" is not a concept first neatly created from human instances and then somehow applied by analogy to bears; it is a broad concept whose origin is from life within the mixed community in which bear anger and human anger are distinct differenti? ations of a common inclusive meaning. Bear anger and human anger are not, of course, identical, but they are not metaphorical, either. And the same thing can be said for "intentions" and "purposes" and "frustrations" and "fears." The physiology of fear, and its connection with such reactions as flight, hiding, and inactivity, has been explored for the human species as for others, and very close likenesses have been found, along with the usual range of equally interesting variations. Physiologists do not throw up their hands when they reach the human case and demand a quite new set of concepts. Nor do zoologists, when observing the behavior of frightened birds or fish, find that everyday descriptions like "alarm" suddenly lose their application, or lead to wrong predictions, and that a new set of terms needs to be invented. Embarrassment about the use of such words is not scientific. It is metaphysical.47 Thus when it comes to redrawing the ethical maps to include the moral considerability of animals, it is not something extraordinary that is being attemp? ted. Animals have been included in the moral com? munity, their interests noted and their sufferings acknowledged, for most of human history. Such inclusion has been entirely proper, ethically, on the far from esoteric principle that any being with interests should not, all other things being equal, be subjected to frustration of those interests, and any being capable of feeling pain should not, all other things being equal, be made to feel it. Some such principle of non-maleficence is about as fun? damental to any morality as any principle could be. It requires no reference to a particular species for its intelligibility and warrants no such arbitrary narrowing. This has not kept humans from exploiting ani? mals, or from eating them, of course; but member? ship in the common community of living things has never been supposed to erase the real differ? ences between the species, and perhaps it does not even preclude carnivorousness in carnivorous species. This is a different and much more narrow question. Doubtless the quality of human morality towards the animals has been deficient in many ways (that is not the point at issue here), but at least a basis for their moral considerability by us has normally not been questioned, and the approp? riateness of obligations outside the species-barrier has quite properly been assumed. The really extraordinary matter is that for a recent moment, measured in evolutionary time, the anthropocen? trism of our man-made culture came so close to excluding from general consciousness all interests and agents but those of our own species. 2. Humanity and ultimate reality. The other sup? posed dichotomy, between humanity and the God of theism, has a longer and more complex tradition behind it, whose details must remain beyond the scope of this essay. The Christian tradition, to take a familiar concrete example, is a long and mixed one. On the one hand (it is held), God's ways are not our ways, his thoughts not our thoughts. On the other hand, however, he is closer than hands and feet and somehow genuinely revealed through the life and ministry of a man. One strand of thought has emphasized the first pole, God's complete otherness;48 another has stressed the second, God's closeness and concern.49 Both aspects need some attention from every theological thinker, of course, since Christianity is neither a monument to an unknown God nor a religion without mystery.50 It follows that the assumption of the "otherness" of ultimate reality is something that can be pushed too far. Taken</page><page sequence="9">THEODICY AND THE STATUS OF ANIMALS 31 without balancing acknowledgment of the con? tinuities between human existence and cognition, on the one hand, and the general conditions of reality, on the other, the theological stress on abso? lute incommensurability between man and God can become a baseless and misleading dogma. Perhaps the pendulum was swung too far during the present century in the direction of "otherness." If so, then theistic environmentalists will be interested in working toward fundamental reforms in doctrines of God that embody such extremes. James Gustafson's initial epistemological assumption, as we saw, is of the lack of correspond? ence between the operations of human cognition and the structures of ultimate reality.51 In one sense this assumption is highly plausible, both because our powers of informational reception are so limited, compared even to the presently known range of processes in the macro- and micro-physical worlds, and because our cognitive capacities are so obviously finite even in our species' natural domain. It is absurd, no doubt, to suppose that our minds are competent to exhaust the universe of its secrets. Still, in another sense, it is no less absurd to maintain that we are completely cut off from some degree of cognitive grasp of the realities that ultimately produced and surround us. If our mental capacities are the fine-tuned product of evolutio? nary interactions with our world, both living and inanimate, then it is not at all plausible that the fundamental structures and processes of reality are "wholly other" than those that the operations of the human mind have been fitted over the long course of development to engage. This does not mean that we are in a position to know ultimate reality without dependence on the models and metaphors that are needed to represent any subject to our human minds. It does mean that some of our models may, in the course of time, prove more reliable than others in the construing of the final realities within which we live. By "re? liability" here is meant freedom from the need to revise expectations, either empirical or moral. The models used in theological thinking, in other words, are answerable (as will be illustrated in the next subsection) both to theoretical and practical criteria.52 If this be so, then it becomes a matter for in ves tigation and debate?not a priori foreclosure?as to what extent models of ultimate reality that utilize personal traits in their depictions are or are not warranted. It should come as no shock that there will always be discrepancies between models and what is represented by them. Such dissonances are entailed in the very concept of modelling.53 If there were no disanalogies, we should be conceiving not through a model at all but through direct inspection. If, on the other hand, there were no positive analogies, our models would not long sustain our cognitive or practical interests. There is no good reason, however, for adopting an attitude of disdain or suspicion toward "anthropomorphic" language in modelling the ultimate. In a harmless sense, all our concepts, all our models, are anthropic. This is a necessary condition of their meaningfulness to us as human beings. We dare not in good logical conscience press our concepts too far toward literal resemblances, of course. But we need not dogmat? ically deny genuine continuities, on the other hand, to the degree that our models continue to serve our purposes. 3. Theodicy and the Community of Life. Our opening problem of theodicy is a prime locus for dissonance, both theoretical and moral, between expectations that might follow from a certain model of ultimate reality and widespread actual experience of the world. If high degrees of continuity between human traits of love and benevolence, together with high degrees of continuity between human traits of organization and governance, are affirmed of ulti? mate reality through traditional theistic models, it is painfully apparent that the initial expectations that might be encouraged by this model are not fulfilled. Explanations and justifications are in order, or what Hume called "conjectures,"54 to show the consistency of the model (which is valued on other grounds) with the evidence. One such set of conjectures, seeking to show through the Free Will Defense the systematic plausibility of the trad? itional theistic model, set our problem at the start. There is nothing wrong with this conjectural enterprise as such, which is continuous with all theorizing. Given the initial broad range of data to be considered, the Free Will Defense does a respectable job in making theoretically coherent the belief in the God of omnipotent love with the</page><page sequence="10">32 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY facts of human agency, human growth in personal responsibility, and human suffering. Coherence is one of the standard theoretical criteria to which thinking about God, like all thinking, is properly held responsible.55 On the other hand, as soon as the range of the relevant moral data is expanded in the conscience of the theistic environmentalist, the coherence of those conjectures offered in the Free Will Defense can be seen as purchased at the expense of the equally vital criterion of adequacy.56 Theoretical adequacy demands that proffered coherences not leave out of account significant domains of data for the sake of too-easy or premature conceptual integration. In the case of theodicy, the redrawing of the ethical map to include animals in a morally significant way is a move on behalf of adequacy, but it strains beyond the breaking point the delicate theoretical coherence that had been achieved by the Free Will Defense. On one level this is a serious loss to thinkers who had come to rely on that defense; on another level it is a spur to greater theoretical penetration and to new coherences marking an important advance in theistic theory.57 Theistic environmentalists find themselves at what Thomas Kuhn calls a crisis situation. The times are ripe for revolution.58 The times seem ripe for conjecturing an alterna? tive model of ultimate reality capable of offering new, more adequate theoretical ranges of coherence for Christian and other theistic thinkers, but not readily vulnerable to the abuses of speciesism. This alternative might attempt to leave intact many anthropomorphic traits important to concrete trad? itions of theistic piety, but only if modifications are made to avoid anthropocentric abuses. Perhaps the kingly (and, to many, morally outmoded) image of absolute "governance" can be less prominent in the new model of ultimate reality, and in its place be put the more organic concept of a larger co-crea? tive (and co-suffering) community of differentiated entities, all morally considerable, all valuable to some degree. Even the common sparrow has value in this scheme of things (Luke 12:6); but a human child is worth many sparrows (Matthew 10:31). The central image by which Christian theists model ultimate reality, of course, is completely anthropomorphic: the incarnate Christ, suffering a human death but triumphant precisely through his pain, creating thereby new community that is dif? ferentiated but integral. One key challenge to would-be Christian environmental thinkers, thus, is therefore to consider how wide that new moral community should be expanded, and what the moral and theoretical consequences will be of its expansion to include at least the animals, if not the whole natural order. In this context, Mary Midgley leaves us to ponder ...the metaphors of Christ. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep, he searches out every single lost sheep and cherishes it?yet the Passover lamb is eaten at the last supper, and in general this must be the destiny of nearly all Hebrew sheep.59 The world of joys and suffering, feasts and betrayals?the real world of eating and being eaten, of dying and new births?should not be strange to that theistic tradition. But a second and even more pressing challenge also looms: can essential anthropomorphism in reli? gion avoid supporting illicit anthropocentrism in ethics? The mental agility as well as the moral sensitivity of theists must increasingly be tested by that question. University of Georgia Received May 22,1984 NOTES 1.
