<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mosaic Figures From Tikal By HATTULA MOHOLY-NAGY With the sense of color values of an expert By- zantine artisan and the exquisite skill of a Faberg√©, Maya craftsmen constructed tiny mosaic-encrusted images of their gods. Although many mosaic figures may have been produced at the Lowland Guatemala site of Tikal, enough remains of only five examples to permit reconstruction of their form and method of manufacture and to permit speculation about their use. Examination of these fragile creations tells us that the actual method of production was fairly simple: the image was modeled in fine white plaster around a plain, usually cylindrical, core, undoubtedly of wood (Figure 1). The mosaic elements were pressed into the plaster, details such as the pupils of the eyes and scrolls of the headdress were added in dull black paint, and often the plaster visible between the mosaic elements made of jade was painted green. But con- sider the painstaking job of planning the design, choosing the materials, shaping the individual pieces and juxtaposing them to obtain the most effective blend and contrast of colors ! A few plain or sparsely embellished plaster frag- ments of limbs were found with each of the four heads illustrated in Figure 1, suggesting that the com- plete human figure was usually, if not invariably, formed. These associated fragments made possible the assembling of one statuette (Figure 2) and the fairly certain reconstruction of another (Figure 3). The disproportionately large size of the faces and head- dresses is not unusual in Mesoamerican figurines made of other materials, such as pottery. Often, as in our examples, so little attention was paid to the lower extremities that we cannot be certain if the figure was intended to be kneeling, sitting or squatting. The mosaic elements are always concentrated on the face of the statuette and the front of the headdress. The body is less heavily encrusted. The back of the head is usually plain and frequently painted dark red. How- ever, the back of the head of the most complete statu- ette (see Figure 2) is carefully modeled, showing bobbed hair and the knot which fastened the headdress. The mosaic was composed of jade, various kinds of marine and freshwater shell, and exposed portions of the plaster matrix. The natural colors of the materials were used according to definite artistic conventions. The faces, the jewelry and the elaborate loincloths 84</page><page sequence="2">1.

In addition, yellowish S pond y lu s shell and dull white shell were sometimes used in forming the complicated headdresses. The workmanship shown in making the individual mosaic elements varies considerably. The pieces of shell are usually well shaped by cutting and grinding. Jade, however, is much more difficult to work. Occa- sionally jade elements do not have shaped edges, al- though many of them were ground as thin as a sheet of paper. Apparently a fairly large plaque of jade was ground to the desired thinness, one face was highly polished and then the plaque was snapped into small pieces, some of which were used without further working. However, some jade elements measuring only a few millimeters in breadth have shaped edges. It is probable that jade and shell elements were some- times reworked from other ornaments. The perforated Spondylus shell element above the left ear plug of one head (see Cover and Figure 1, C) seems to be an example of such reworking. While we can make some definite statements about the appearance and production of these little figures, we remain somewhat uncertain as to what they meant to those who made them. The contexts in which these figurines were found suggest that they represent Maya deities. All mosaic objects found at Tikal have oc- curred as offerings in the caches placed in ceremonial structures and beneath stelae or - more rarely - as of- ferings in the tombs of important persons. Even loose mosaic elements are rare in other contexts. The best preserved figures - all of the five described here - come from caches in buildings, for the Tikal custom was to place the mosaic in a covered pottery jar which gave it some protection (Figure 4) . All of the figures are of the male sex. Three are of young men (see Figure 1, A and C, Figure 2) and may represent the Maize God or, perhaps, the Sun God in his youthful aspect. The face of the most complete one (see Figure 2) and that of one of the detached heads (see Figure 1, A) seem to be the work of the same craftsman. The bird headdress worn by the latter also occurs on mold-made pottery figurine- whistles of a later period. The other two head frag- ments (see Figures 1, B, D and E, Figure 3) are of old, grotesque individuals. They may be intended to represent the Sun God in his aged aspect or possibly the Mam, or Old God, who was the deity of the Maya underworld. Yet, assuming that we are dealing with sacred or ceremonial objects, it is difficult to imagine that such 86</page><page sequence="4">2. Three views of most complete mosaic figure found at Tikal.

Mosaic Figures continued beautiful and carefully constructed artifacts were in- tended solely as cache or tomb offerings, to be buried forever the moment they were finished. In fact, the condition of even the most complete examples sug- gests they were already damaged when placed in the pottery containers and interred. Perhaps they were small cult objects used in ceremonies celebrated in the temples. According to what we know of Maya customs at Tikal, broken images might have been considered appropriate offerings for caches or burials. Because of the time and skill required, one might suppose that this kind of mosaic figure was rarely produced. Yet at Tikal the large number of fragments - a number increased by the high humidity which has worked to dissolve the plaster matrix and rot out the wooden cores - indicates that they were not uncom- mon. Besides the five described here, the remains of at least ten other mosaic heads have been excavated, as well as about twenty badly decomposed masses of undetermined form which may also have been fig- urines. The Tikal Maya also created other ornaments of small mosaic pieces. We have a pair of beautiful, very ornate ear ornaments from a tomb (Figures 5 and 6), a tiny, crude, anthropomorphic figure and at least two burial masks and/or headdresses which we have not been able to reconstruct. Although widespread and long-lived in other parts of Mesoamerica, this type of mosaic work seems re- stricted at Tikal to the latter half of the period of re- ligious and artistic florescence known as the Early Classic. According to present evidence, A.D. 400-550 seems the best estimate for the time of manufacture and use. By the beginning of the succeeding Late Classic period, Tikal artisans had turned their imagi- nations and abilities to other media, and the produc- tion of figurines and, in fact, of all other forms of this kind of mosaic work had ceased.
