FIELD DAY REVIEW 6 2010 95</page><page sequence="3">FIELD DAY REVIEW Wittgenstein's anecdote allows for the possibility that where friends are concerned, or those to whom we are well disposed, the photographs are eagerly viewed, as if in a desire to share the experience. 'Wish we were there!' is the appropriate response, but in this case, he adds, prejudice and friendship are doing the work. We should be under no illusion that the photograph 'objectively' captures the experience of the scene in a way that would be compelling to a 'third party', or a stranger not already implicated in the situation. What is missing for the disinterested observer in the 'insipid photograph'? Precisely the sense of being there, the desire to share the experience. Anyone can grasp the content, the 'information', on display: what eludes the third party operates at the level of form, the organization, style and orientation of the work. In an attempt to make holiday snaps more amenable to all, there is a temptation to re-create them in the image of postcards, thus intercepting even our own experience in the act of representation. This is one of the framing perspectives behind James Coleman's Connemara Landscape, first exhibited at Galway in 1980, and a central feature of the major retrospective of his work at the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA), the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA), and the Project Theatre in Dublin, March-June 2009. For many Irish people growing up in the formative decades of the new Irish state, the title of Coleman's work alone would be sufficient to summon up images of Paul Henry's paintings of 'Romantic Ireland' (Fig. 2), as popularized in successive campaigns by tourist boards to bring holiday-makers to the West. This is perhaps one of the initial reasons Coleman's enigmatic installation dispenses with the need for photographic reproduction; on hearing the title, viewers already have an image in their mind. Coleman's projected image goes further, however, than an engagement with its immediate Irish resonances: it also raises questions about representation itself, and the nature of perception as a distinctively human way of responding to the landscape of our lives. Wittgenstein's example focuses on an issue central to the work of James Coleman: what might be termed 'the addressivity of the eye', the sense in which the image, no less than the word, solicits a beholder, no matter how complex or attenuated the mode of address. That vision has its basis in the dialogical imagination is not by any means a universally held position. Conventionally, language is understood as based on dialogue, since it would be hard to imagine the need to speak without a listener, or an interlocutor.2 One of the far-reaching effects of the Renaissance - signalled by what Martin Heidegger referred to as the emergence of the 'modern world picture', the representation of the world as a picture - was the severing of vision from a relay of 'looks', and its transformation into the gaze, directed primarily towards objects.^ Perspective played an important role in this shift in perception: projected onto the material world, it modelled vision on a gaze in which there was no looking back. Under this new optical regime, perception had no equivalent of dialogue: its relationship was primarily to objects and space, rather than to other observers or points of view. It is striking that in James Coleman's work, landscape, even the image itself, appears to look back, if only by implicating the spectator in the field of vision. There is no trace of the anthropomorphic, though there is a viewer moving around the gallery.

Courtesy of the artist viewers with a panning shot of the room and audience from the performer's point of view - simulating the birth of the viewer through the eyes of the King, as in the 'sovereign subject' of Velazquez's Las Meninas. Coleman's mirror-stage questions the extent to which the sovereignty of sight in Western aesthetics is structured by a politics of vision, the all-seeing eye of the sovereign himself (Figs. 3 &amp; 4). In much of Coleman's early practice, this enquiry into the power of the visible took the form of what it was to see something as a picture in the first place, based on, among other investigations, a series of sustained reflections on Wittgenstein's concept of 'seeing-as'.5 What is it, these works ask, to see a picture as something, to bring an image under a description, whether a pail filling with water which we end up viewing as an empty still-life (Pump, 1972), a street scene in Milan subject to endless verbal descriptions in voice-over, which never seem to exhaust what is seen (Slide Piece, (1972-73)) (Fig. 1), or the switching gestalts of Joseph Jastrow's famous 'duck/rabbit' figure (Playback of a Dream, 1974) that provided the basis of Wittgenstein's initial discussion of 'seeing-as'? A key question here is, when, if ever, do we simply see, as against seeing something as such-and-such, bringing our perceptions of the world under a description, or within a frame of reference? For the philosopher Stephen Mulhall, all seeing is bound up with 'seeing-as', but for Wittgenstein this is not always true: we see a human face, not something as a face.6 It is not that we first perceive a receptacle of flesh and bone, and then interpret it as a face: rather, we see a face immediately, and have to work hard to see it in terms of viscera and muscle - unless, that is, we are Francis Bacon.7 It is notable that in this case of seeing simpliciter, there is no objective gaze, for, as Wittgenstein reminds us, it not just that we observe a face: it also observes us.8 This again forms part of Charon (1989): the witness to the crime, who claims he can impersonate the face of the criminal in front of the camera, eventually comes to resemble the photographer himself. Perhaps the sole recognizable elements in Connemara Landscape are windows, and what is true of eyes is also true of windows: we do not see them, they are also used to look back at us. In the case of the material world, perception, no matter how objective, 5 Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, trans. G. E. M.

Linear perspective constituted an attempt to project scientific stability onto the pictorial plane, but for Coleman, perspective is precisely a projection (Fig. 5) in more ways than one. Hence the abiding fascination in his work with what might be considered the uncertainty principle haunting scientific accounts of perspective: the phenomenon of anamorphosis, the possibility that distortion is inherent in the projected image unless viewed from a specific position. In perspective, the spectator is removed 99</page><page sequence="7">FIELD DAY REVIEW Figure 5: Abraham Bosse, Les Perspecteurs, 1 647-48. Eau Forte, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Paris from the pictorial field: in anamorphosis, the addressivity of the image is retained, soliciting the presence of the spectator in this position. It is for this reason that faced (in a more precise sense than usual) with Coleman's projected Connemara Landscape, the viewer tends to move around, looking for the vantage point that will reveal what we have come to expect from the romantic promise of the title. Such emplotting of the spectator was central, as Leo Steinberg has shown, to some of the most powerful interrogations of pictorial representation in Renaissance art, most notably Caravaggios's extraordinary paintings of St. Peter and St. Paul in the Cerasi Chapel in Rome (Figs. 6 &amp; 7) and Leonardo's famous Last Supper in Milan.9 In these works, pictorial space extends beyond the 'frame' to the architectural setting of the picture, the physical embodiment of the spectator raising questions of who is viewing what, from what position, and in relation to what other possible viewing points (particularly those excluded from the scene). It is in this sense that gallery space in Connemara Landscape implicates spectators in the scene of projection, thereby contesting the powerful strand in the modernist criticism that contends that the art object should stand alone, replete in its integrity. This position, identified with the writings of Clement Greenberg and Michael Fried, sees the self-sufficiency of artwork as aspiring to the condition of 'objecthooď, oblivious to either spectators or its surroundings.10 For Fried, anything less than the 'absorption' of a visual work unto itself amounts to what he terms 'theatricality', a series of postures derived from another medium that violates the opticality of art.11 It is not that Coleman sets out to contradict this principle; rather, he refuses the terms of the opposition in the first place. As Rosalind Krauss has noted, Coleman's practice can be seen as a sustained investigation into precisely the specificity of the medium - of the various media forms he has worked in, whether film, photography, slide projection, the photo-novel, or other forms.12 Unlike Greenberg, the distinctiveness of a medium is not considered in fixed or essentialist terms but is negotiated in terms of its limits, transfers and crossovers, the intervals, as it were, between one medium and another. The image is thus on an uneven continuum with the single frame shot, the studio still, the jump-cuts of the photo-novel, the sequential images of the slide-show, and the moving image of film - all that happens in the interim between one frame and another. More recently, Michael Fried has turned his attention to photography and, in particular, the monumental photographic installations of Jeff Wall. Wall's work is cited in support of his contention that it is only by turning its back on the spectator and ignoring gallery space that pictorial representation can capture the most elusive aspects of everyday life: precisely its spontaneity and uncontrived appearance. 9 Leo Steinberg, 'Observations in the Cerasi Chapel', Art Bulletin, 41, 2 (1959), 183-90. 10 See Clement Greenberg, 'Towards a New Laocoon', in his Art and Culture: Critical Essays (New York, 1992); Michael Fried, Art and Objecthood: Essays and Reviews (Chicago, 1998); Jonathan Harris, Writing Back to Modern Art: After Greenberg, Fried, and Clark (London, 2005). 11 Michael Fried, Absorption and Theatricality: Painting and the Beholder in the Age of Diderot (Chicago, 1986 [1980]) 12 Rosalind Krauss, 'Reinventing the Medium: Introduction to Photography', in Baker, ed., James Coleman, 185-210. 100</page><page sequence="8">THE ADDRESSIVITY OF THE EYE: JAMES COLEMAN'S CONNEMARA LANDSCAPE Figure 6: Caravaggio (Merisi, Michelangelo da (1 57 1-16 10): Conversion of Saint Paul. 1 600, Rome, Church of Santa Maria del Popolo.

Wittgenstein's own example of the detached 'third party' looking at the postcard would seem to suggest otherwise, since it is precisely lack of participation, the absence of a relational aesthetics, that leads to incomprehension, the cold eye of the passer-by.16 Aesthetic form negotiates this deficit by addressing the stranger as a participant, drawing him or her not into the work but into a relationship with the work, opening vistas on what would otherwise be indifferent experiences, or inscrutable lives.

Howard Eiland and Michael W. Jennings (Cambridge, MA), 260 back to stop and stare, intent on catching reality off-guard, Walter Benjamin argued that it is precisely such self-consciousness on the part of the spectator that screens out the most elusive aspects of reality: '[O]nly what has not been experienced explicitly and consciously, what has not happened to the subject as an experience, can become a component of mémoire involontaire [involuntary memory].'17 Or, as Diarmuid Costello has summarized this aspect of Benjamin: 'only what bypasses our conscious defences and thereby leaves a memory trace amounts to experience in the full sense', experience that escapes through the nets of surveillance, whether of the sovereign self or the gaze of detached, all- seeing third parties.18 It is in this light that we should view Coleman's recourse to the meandering lines of the doodle in Connemara Landscape, the involuntary traces that open up the experience of landscape to its excluded histories, the off-screen space beyond the official images of Romantic Ireland. This mode of spontaneity does not leave the world as it is but throws into question the framing narratives that often enclose, rather than expand, the frames of everyday experience. What is at stake here is an ethical as well as an aesthetic dimension to art in an age of new information technologies. Jacques Rancière has identified a recurrent concern with justice - the rule of law, the exercise of authority and power - in Coleman's work, and its deep relationship to regimes of the visible: justice must not only be done but be seen to be done.19 In much of Coleman's practice, it is as if these terms have been reversed and the task of the image itself is to do justice to a world in which aesthetics, the lure of beauty, is itself often used to cover up the scene of a crime. Walter Benjamin famously argued that 'there is no facsimile of the aura', meaning by 'aura' the addressivity of the image that is endangered by the technological medium in an age of mass reproduction.20 By resisting reproduction itself, even in the pages of a catalogue, the projection of Connemara Landscape retrieves the medium, the 'facsimile', from a fallen condition, as much as resists the urge to return to a primordial state of innocence before the Fall. 103</page></plain_text>
