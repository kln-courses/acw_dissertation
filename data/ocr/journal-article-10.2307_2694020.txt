DOZIER ABSTRACT Interest in the nature of the socio-political and cere- monial life of prehistoric inhabitants in recent years has resulted in an exchange of information between archae- ologists and ethnologists. This paper is an initial effort to furnish a list of the kinds of social units to be found among Southwestern groups in the ethnographic present. It is hoped that this list will stimulate further discus- sion, bring about greater exchange of information, and result in a better understanding of the nature of pre- historic and ethnographic socio-political and ceremonial units in the American Southwest. A NUMBER of recent publications have /71, either stressed the need for a systematic search for evidence of social and religious or- ganizations in the societies represented in archaeological sites or have actually inferred the nature of social units from settlement patterns, size of dwellings, ceremonial structure, demo- graphic features, and the like (Bluhm 1960; Change 1958; Haury 1956; Martin and Rinaldo 1950; Martin and others 1962; Reed 1956; Sears 1961; Steward 1937, 1938). To further such research it appears useful to delineate for one geographical area, the Southwestern United States, a summary list of the present or recent types of social, political, and ceremonial organi- zations reported in the ethnographic literature for the area. Even with a living people it is difficult to pin down social units by reference to either geographical or architectural features, and the task of identifying social units in archaeo- logical sites is, of course, enormously greater. We have, therefore, whenever poissible, noted the factor of spatial localization or nonlocaliza- tion of social units, and if localized, whether such units can be identified with reference to architectural features. We have also indicated the relationships of large structures, such as kivas, and moiety, lineage, and association houses with existing types of social and cere- monial units. The deep-rooted nature of South- western socio-political and ceremonial organiza- tions is recognized by all Southwestern scholars, and such relationships as we may find between these units and architectural features, settle- ment patterns, and the like in the contemporary indigenous populations very likely are the per- sistences of past associations. Cause and effect relationships which are in- volved in the development of the various kinds of social units and the ways in which they are integrated in specific societies is another in- triguing problem. The investigation of such re- lationships will lead to an analysis of ecologi- cal and cultural factors and will have to take into consideration matters of isolation and exter- nal pressures, both environmental and human, that impinge on Southwestern Pueblo societies. It is tempting to try to do this here, but this is a problem for another paper. The task we have assigned ourselves is simply the delineation of Southwestern socio-political and ceremonial units to serve as a check list for the identifica- tion of such units in archaeological sites. The area encompassed under the term South- west in this paper is essentially restricted to the Indian groups in New Mexico and Arizona, al- though a number of the Shoshonean groups described by Steward (1938) have also been included. California groups and societies south of the border are excluded. This is simply for the sake of convenience; if this outline is found useful, it may be expanded to include other groups and thereby reveal the nature of social and ceremonial units not found in the ones described here. In this paper socio-political groups are pre- sented first in terms of a "simple to complex" scheme; this is then followed by an outline of ceremonial units and associated architectural structures. The final section recapitulates the purposes of the outline and calls attention to certain kinds of material items and architectural features which may provide leads for the identi- fication of social and ceremonial units in pre- historic sites. SOCIO-POLITICAL UNITS 1. Household Types: Nuclear family; extended families: patrilocal, matrilocal, bilocal, ambi- local. (a) The nuclear family is characteristically a unit comprising a husband, wife, and children, with perhaps an unattached relative, such as a widowed grandfather or grandmother or an un- married brother, sister, nephew, or niece. The unit is perhaps best delimited spatially among the Great Basin Shoshonean groups where it 38</page><page sequence="2">DOZIER ] SOCIAL UNITS AND ARCHAEOLOGY 39 occupied a brush shelter clearly set apart from other structures. The Navaho hogan may also be pointed out as a clear delimitation of the nuclear family (Kluckhohn and Leighton 1946: 54-5). Elsewhere, for example, in Pueblo com- munities, the nuclear family is more difficult to separate from the extended family because houses are connected and -the nuclear family is not always restricted to a single room. While the difficulty of identification cannot be mini- mized, attention to certain architectural features may aid in identifying this unit in archaeologi- cal sites. Thus among contemporary Pueblos a nuclear family has no more than two or three rooms to itself. This unit is usually partitioned off by a wall from other such units in the series of adjoining rooms. Furthermore, the doors or exits are ordinarily arranged in such a way as to afford entrance only to the nuclear family unit. (b) The matrilocal extended family is a unit consisting of an older woman with her husband and unmarried children, together with married daughters and their husbands and unmarried children. This unit, which occupies a series of adjoining rooms, is characteristic of the Hopi, Hopi-Tewa, and Zuni (Eggan 1950: 29-30; Dozier 1954: 312). Matrilocal extended fami- lies at Acoma, Laguna, and the Eastern Keresan pueblos were also apparently like those of the Hopi, Hopi-Tewa, and Zuni but have broken down under modern conditions (Eggan 1950: 232, 263, 307). The "hogan group" of the Nava- ho was also commonly a matrilocal extended family, although this group was not always con- sistently matrilocal (Kluckhohn and Leighton 1946: 56-7). Among other Southern Athapas- cans, the Chiricahua, Mescalero, and Western Apache have been reported as having matri- local extended families (Opler 1937: 182-3, 1941: 18; Kaut 1957: 39). (c) The composition of the patrilocal ex- tended family is roughly the counterpart of the matrilocal extended family, male and female positions being simply reversed. This unit as a spatially delimited unit is not specified any- where in the ethnographic literature of the Southwest. While the Pima and Papago appear to have emphasized the father's lineage, resi- dence as patrilocal extended families does not appear to have been a consistent pattern (Jo- seph and others 1949: 54). Other patrilineal groups like the Colorado and Gila River Yumans apparently never had patrilocal resi- dence as a consistent pattern (Spier 1936: 5-6). (d) Ambilocal extended households are and were found among the Tewa Pueblos (Dozier 1960: 156-8) and perhaps at Picuris and Taos as well. The composition of such a unit is as follows: an old couple and a number of their children (but not all) with the spouses of these children and their children. The unit originally occupied a series of adjoining rooms, although each nuclear family is separated from the others by having one or more rooms to, itself. Under modern conditions the spatial delimitation of the ambilocal extended family has been dis- rupted. Among the Tewa there is now an in- creasing tendency for nuclear families to build away from the concentrated area, but the social integrity of the ambilocal extended family re- mains and there are numerous occasions when the unit comes together. The composition of an ambilocal or bilocal extended family can never be fixed, of course (Murdock 1949: 35). Among the Tewa, align- ment of a family of procreation with one or the o,ther of the spouse's family of orientation de- pends essentially on three factors: (1) prestige or status ranking of the families of orientation, (2) the political faction with which a newly married couple wish to identify themselves, and (3) the comparatively greater ease of interaction patterns established between the couple and one of the spouse's family of orientation during the initial period of marriage. With the possible exception of the nuclear family, none of the household types described above occurred as independent social and politi- cal units. Among the Western Shoshoni and probably the Southern Paiute families, uncer- tainties of food limited the economic unit to the elementary family (Steward 1958: 236). Dur- ing most of the year the nuclear family head was the political leader. When several related families were associated in a winter encamp- ment among the Western Shoshoni, or when they traveled together, the oldest or most influ- ential man directed activities. He had no title, however (Steward 1938: 246). Elsewhere among Southwestern groups, social structures larger than the extended family de- fined the limits of social and political control. Extended families of any type will be diffi- cult to distinguish from one another and from lineage or clan segments. This is because the spatial delimitation is not distinct enough. The discovery of a ceremonial house or room will</page><page sequence="3">40 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 1, 1965 very likely indicate either a lineage (clan seg- ment) or an association unit. The "group house, fetish and priest complex" among the Pueblos provides a room to contain ceremonial items used in the rituals of such organizations. It is possible that wall and/or floor paintings or per- haps some of the fetishes and ceremonial para- phernalia of such a room may be found in situ. 2. Lineal Groups: Lineages, clans, phratries. (a) Lineages or clan segments were not spa- tially delimited in recent times (they are not reported in the ethnographic literature; see 2b below). Matrilocal residence in the Western Pueblos separated men from the lineage, and only on ritual occasions were lineages or clan segments spatially defined. Despite this unlocal- ized aspect olf lineages and clan segments, they were important social, ceremonial, and eco- nomic units when they did occur. In all the Western Pueblos a house was assigned to the important lineage or clan segment in each vil- lage where the important fetishes and other ritual objects were kept (Eggan 1950: 298). (b) Matrilineal exogamous clans are reported for Western Pueblos (Hopi, Hopi-Tewa, Zuni, Acoma, Laguna), Eastern Keresans, Jemez Pueb- lo, Navaho, Western Apache, and the South- eastern Yavapai. Clans are not localized among any of the Puieblos where they have been reported. Eggan (1950: 299-300) believes that clan and lineage were once equivalent. If this was so, then it is possible that Pueb-lo clans, perhaps more prop- erly lineages, were localized in the past. Migra- tion legends report separate migration routes for clans or lineages in the prehistoric past. Ac- cording to Chang (1958: 321-2), these legends appear to be in accord with archaeological data. Navaho matrilineal clans have predominantly geographical names, which suggests that these clans were once local groups (Kluckhohn and Leighton 1946: 63-4). Kaut (1957: 55), who used Grenville Goodwin's notes on the Western Apache, also reports the impoirtance of localized matrilineal clans or clan segments among the Western Apache. Chang (1958: 321-2) and Eggan (1950: 299-300) both suggest that un- localized, large multiple-matrilineal-lineage clans developed after population increases and migrations. While this explanation is for the prehistoric Pueblos, it would appear to hold also for the unlocalized clans of the Navaho and Western Apache. The Southeastern Yavapai apparently took over matrilineal clans through close contact and intermarriage with the West- ern Apache. (c) Patrilineal exogamous, nonlocalized clans were characteristic of the Yuman tribes of the lower Colorado and Gila rivers (Spier 1936: 5). Other Yuman speakers, such as the Havasupai, Walapai, and Yavapai proper, were clanless. The Uto-Aztecan Pima and Papago are reported to have had four or five patrilineal but non- exogamous clans. In addition, a patrilineal moiety system, also nonexogamous, operated on the village level. The village is reported to have been an exogamous unit. However, data are very ambiguous, and our knowledge of early Pima-Papago social organization is far from clear (Russell 1908: 196-7; Parsons 1928: 448-58; Spier 1936: 10-11; Underhill 1939). An independent, localized political unit in the form o-f a patrilineal exogamous clan appears to be nonexistent in the Southwest. Very prob- ably the independent unit of the Yuman tribes of the lower Colorado, and Gila rivers and of the Piman peoples of southern Arizona and northern Sonora was the shifting loose village with patrilineal bias. (d) Unnamed phratries have been reported for the Hopi, Navaho, and Western Apache. The Hopi phratry was probably a device to inte- grate larger populations and very likely of recent origin (Eggan 1950: 300). With the Hopi, the phratry organization is the largest exogamic group; it is an organization which safeguards against clan extinction by absorbing the cere- monial and economic responsibilities of extinct clans and provides for the incorporation of migrant groups whose clans are not represented in the village or tribe. Navaho linked clans appear to have the same functions, except that exogamic restrictions appear to be less rigidly observed (Kluckhohn and Leighton 1946: 65- 6). While Hopi phratries are discrete entities, Navaho phratries are linked in "chain fashion." Among the Western Apache the phratries also exhibited a discreteness and operated as cor- porate groups in ceremonials and warfare (Kaut 1957: 48-59). Because of the unlocalized nature of lineages, clans, and phratries, none of these units, with the possible exception of the phratry organi- zation of the Western Apache, have functioned as socio-political units. Other social units, either the village or a local nonkinship group like the band, have determined the boundaries of politi-</page><page sequence="4">DOZIER ] SOCIAL UNITS AND ARCHAEOLOGY 41 cal control among those groups with clan organi- zations. In the prehistoric past, lineages or clan segments (Steward 1937) may have been local- ized and perhaps operated as independent politi- cal units among the cultural ancestors of the Western Pueblos. Even today Hopi lineages or clan segments have a remarkable independence within the village and operate as quasi-autono- mous social, ceremonial, economic, and political units (Titiev 1944: 69). 3. NonLineal. Groups: Social or ceremonial moieties, local groups, bands, village communi- ties, multiple-village communities. Units here discussed are composed of related and unrelated families. While some of these structures may have a bias or inclination toward unilineality and its members may be relatives, there are no specific conditions of kinship for membership. There are also no specific rules of exogamy or endogamy in any of these units. (a) Moieties, if exogamous, would have been discussed under unilineal units above, but moie- ties in the Southwest are nonexogamous. Mem- bership in Southwestern moieties is usually gained through the father, but these moieties are not rigidly patrilineal, and membership may be changed for a variety of reasons. Their chief function in the groups in which they occur are social, ceremonial, and political (compare Lowie 1940: 427 and Murdock 1949: 47). They pro- vide opposing teams for games or dances or split the ceremonial and governmental duties in the group. Dual divisions in the Southwest have rele- vance on the village or community level only and are not independent political units apart from the community of which they are a part. Moieties of this kind have been reported for the Pima, Papago, Laguna, and Eastern Keresan and Tanoan groups. Among the Tewa, where they form the most important ceremonial and political structures, moieties alternate in shar- ing the ceremonial and governmental responsi- bilities of each pueblo semiannually. (b) Local Groups. Among Southern Atha- paskans (Navaho, Western Apache, Chirica- hua, Mescalero, Lipan, Jicarilla, and Kiowa Apache) the most frequently interacting, terri- torially localized unit for communal enterprises was the local group. The local group appears to have coincided with a clan or clan segment among the Western Apache (Kaut 1957: 39), but elsewhere local groups were not unilineal (Kluckhohn and Leighton 1946: 62-3; Opler 1941: 181-4). The unit which Kluckhohn and Leighton (1946: 62-3) call an "outfit" among the Navaho is undoubtedly a local group of the kind re- ported for other Southern Athapascan groups. Their term "local group" or "community" for the Navaho, on the other hand, describes a unit which we have designated as a "band." The local group was an important unit for Southern Athapascans who engaged in frequent raids, organized hunting drives, and also gath- ered frequently for social dances and cere- monies. While there was no formal organiza- tion, there was a leader who directed collective activities of the group. Much depended on the abilities of the leader; if he used his authority wisely and the group liked him, he might be the leader for a long time; o!therwise another man might be followed and considered as the leader. Since a local group was often mobilized on short notice, it included only families who lived in a fairly limited area, and this area was seldom very large (Opler, M.E. 1937: 180-2). (c) Bands. This unit conforms to the organi- zation which Steward (1938: 259) has desig- nated as a composite band. Steward (1938: 259) placed the bands of the Owens Valley Paiute and the Northern Shoshoni in this cate- gory. Others having band organizations in the Southwest are or were the Navaho (Kluckhohn and Leighton 1946: 68-9), all the Southern Athapascans (Kaut 1957: 11), and the South- ern Ute (Opler, Marvin K. 1940: 126). Steward's "unilineal band" (1938: 259) ap- pears to conform to the lineage or clan segment postulated above as important in prehistoric times among the cultural ancestors of the West- ern Pueblos. Numbers in a band varied, but usually there were more than 100 persons (Steward 1937: 259). The band is nonexogamous, occupies a fairly well-defined territory and, for those so- cieties in which it has been reported, forms the largest socio-political unit. A band organization denotes a high degree of mobility, and the groups which possessed bands were very mo- bile. Indeed, some of these bands, for example, those of the Southern Ute and Apaches east of the Rio Grande, may have developed after the introduction of the horse. (d) Village Communities. Two general types of villages are apparent in the ethnographic lit- erature of the Southwest. Further study and</page><page sequence="5">42 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 1, 1965 analysis may reveal other subtypes, but for the present we have found it useful to discuss South- western villages in the following two categories: (1) noncentralized or loosely integrated villages and (2) centralized or tightly integrated villages. Noncentralized, loosely integrated communi- ties are or were characteristic of the Havasupai, Pima, Papago, and the Colorado and Gila River Yumans. Among the Pueblos, the Hopi villages are less centralized than Zuni, Acoma, or the Rio Grande Pueblos, but in our two fold classi- fication they would fit under category (2) as having centralized or tightly integrated villages. Laguna split into a number of satellite villages after the middle of the last century, and the nature of its early integration is unknown. Zuni and the Rio Grande Pueblos exhibit the highest degree of centralization and integration. Settlement patterns are conspicuously differ- ent in the two types of villages. The noncentral- ized, loosely integrated villages exhibit scattered houses and the absence of formalized grouping. On the other hand, the compact buildings and formal patterned arrangement of Pueblo com- munities are contrastingly different (Reed 1956: 13-17). A clue to village centralization is contained in Kroeber's (1917: 116) characterization of Zuni integration: Four or five different planes of systematization cross out each other and thus preserve for the whole society an integrity that would speedily be lost if the planes merged and thereby inclined to encourage segregation and fission. The clans, the fraternities, the priesthoods, the kivas, in a measure the gaming parties, are all divid- ing agencies. If they coincided, the rifts in the social structure would be deep; by countering each other they cause segmentations which produce an almost marvel- ous complexity, but can never break the national entity apart. It would appear, therefore, that noncentral- ized and loosely integrated villages have few of the socio-political or ceremonial organizations to provide tight integration. Eggan (1950: 217) also stresses the importance of the lineage or clan segment for integration, particularly in its corporate aspects of owning houses, land, and ceremonial paraphernalia, as well as in serving as a custodian of ceremonial duties and obliga- tions. The noncentralized or loosely integrated villages have only a few or none of these features of the Pueblos. The Havasupai, for example, have no lineages or clans. The Havasupai nu- clear family is the basic economic and social unit even though it is loosely incorporated into an extended family and even more loosely into the village. In its religious and ceremonial life there are no associations and no established re- ligious or political positions. There is no organi- zation of shamans or chiefs. Shamans are men who acquire their power by dreaming or by in- heritance. Men become chiefs partly by being relatives of former chiefs and partly by prestige and renown (Spier 1928: 209-91). Yumans of the lower Colorado and Gila rivers had patrilineal unlocalized clans, but lineages or clan segments did not function as corporate groups either on the tribal or the village level. The village in its looseness and in its lack of a well-defined social and ceremonial organization resembled that of the Havasupai. The Pima and Papiago are characterized by Strong (1927: 45) as having a "clan house- priest-fetish complex," but this is doubted by Spier (1936: 11), who suggests that ceremonial paraphernalia was individual equipment rather than clan-owned. The Vikita-Navitco com- plex of the Papago and Pima, which was asso- ciated with masked dancers, curing sickness, and bringing rain, may have been a curing asso- ciation. But there is no evidence for other so- cial and ceremonial organizations of the kind reported for the Pueblos below. We suggest that the loosely integrated nature of Yuman and Pima-Papago villages reflects the absence of these social and ceremonial features found abun- dantly among the Pueblos. From our brief analysis, we believe loosely integrated villages recogpized from scattered settlement patterns would correlate with partial or complete absence of the kind.s of social and ceremonial organizations summarized below. Conversely, tightly integrated communities, evi- dent in compact village sites, would correlate with complex, cross-cutting social and cere- monial organizations. (e) Multiple villages. No clear-cut evidence for muliple villages has been provided in the ethnographic literature of the Southwest, but some groups reveal a tendency in this direction. The Hopi, for example, have a main ceremonial village which extends ceremonial supervision over a number of subordinate villages. Walpi occupies the position of the main ceremonial village on First Mesa and dominates in cere- monial matters over Sichomovi (the middle vil- lage) and Hano, the Tewa immigrant village (Dozier 1954: 284). Shongopovi on Second Mesa has a position comparable to Walpi over</page><page sequence="6">DOZIER ] SOCIAL UNITS AND ARCHAEOLOGY 43 some Second and Third Mesa villages (Eggan 1950: 107, 111). The Papago and perhaps the Pima appear to have had main villages with surrounding "daughter-villages." These daughter villages were apparently founded by members of the main village who needed new farm land but re- mained ceremonially dependent on the mother village (Underhill 1956: 193). Apparently, some villages, including their daughter villages, were exogamous. The pueblos of Laguna and Acoma and their satellite villages may also be cited in this con- nection, but the dispersal of the population in these pueblos and the founding of new villages definitely occurred under modern pressures and influences. Prehistorically, the Great Kiva may indicate the existence of a socio-political or re- ligious organization on an inter-village level (Martin and others 1961: 167; 1962: 220-22). Recent Pueblo villages, however, appear to have been independent units until they came under Euro-American influence and control. On a higher "tribal level," for most South- western groups this was simply a matter of com- mon language and occupation of contiguous territory. The Yuman tribes of the lower Colo- rado and Gila rivers may have been an excep- tion. Spier (1933: 154) reports the strong na- tional consciousness of these Yuman tribes. Tribal solidarity was expressed by having only one chief for the whole tribe, by the absence of internecine feuds, and by presenting a united front against enemies, whether in attack or de- fense. But there was no formal organization on a tribal level, and "the functions of a chief seem to have been slight, his authority more admoni- tory than coercive" (Spier 1936: 158). CEREMONIAL UNITS AND CEREMONIAL BUILDINGS Ceremonial units are discussed along with the physical structures that are associated with them. Nowhere in the Southwest were build- ings used for purely social or political purposes; such structures appear always to have funda- mentally ceremonial functions. The procedure in presenting this information has been partly reversed from the plan followed above. The largest ceremonial units, those serving the larg- est number of people, are presented first, fol- lowed by consistently smaller units. 1. "Tribal" or village ceremonial organiza- tions. A village-wide organization with some form of initiation as a precondition or confirmation of membership is characteristic of the Pueblos. No other groups in the Southwes-t appear to have or to have had organizations of this kind. (a) The Katcina cult. For all except the Tiwa Pueblos, the Katcina cult was a tribal or village-wide organization, although there are detailed differences in organization and mem- bership in the individual pueblos. Among the Hopi, the cult is tribal, but it is associated with kivas in each village. Both men and women are initiated, but only men partici- pate in ceremonials that involve impersonation of Katcina. Each kiva has a Katcina dance group, and there are as many Katcina dance groups as there are kivas. The number of kivas varies in each village; Sichomovi and Hano, on First Mesa have two each, but Walpi has five, while Old Oraibi on Third Mesa had 13 kivas shortly before its "disintegration" in 1906 (Titiev 1944: 245). At Zuni the Katcina cult is village-wide, but women are normally excluded. Six Katcina dance groups are associated with ceremonial houses. These houses do not differ substantially from other houses but are used only for cere- monial purposes. The Acoma and Laguna Katcina cult organi- zations are also village-wide; both sexes are ini- tiated into the cult but, as with the Hopi and Zuni, only men take part in cult activities. The Katcina cult in these pueblos is also associated with kivas. Seven kivas are reported for Acoma, but only five are used by the Katcina cult. One kiva, considered the head kiva, is reserved for the use of the Antelope clan and its head, who is also village chief. The other kiva is the cere- monial chamber of the Fire Association, an im- portant curing fraternity. The number of kivas is unknown for Laguna, but the Katcina cult was associated with these structures. Except for Santa Ana pueblo, the Katcina cult of the Eastern Keresan pueblos is associated with the dual division kivas. All males are ini- tiated into the cult, but women are excluded from membership. The Katcina organization of Jemez, the only surviving Towa-speaking pueblo, appears to parallel the organization of the cult in most Eastern Keresan pueblos. Santa Ana</page><page sequence="7">44 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 1, 1965 appears to diverge from the Eastern Keresan pattern. In this pueblo there are five Katcina groups, each managed by a medicine association, and membership is voluntary and open to both sexes. It is reported that women also imper- sonate Katcina but portray only female types (White 1942: 133). Apparently, the five Kat- cina groups use the two kivas for ceremonies, but how they schedule such ritualistic events in these structures is not specified. The Tewa Katcina cult was, and is, a dual organization, membership formerly being re- quired of all males and validated by initiation. Women are excluded from membership. Only one communal kiva was formerly used by both groups of Katcina in the performance of cere- monial rites. A point recently clarified is that, despite the present existence of two or more kivas among the Tewa, the original pattern was a single, large, communal kiva structure (Hawley 1950: 287). The Katcina cult is ab- sent among the Tiwa Pueblos. The Katcina cult is not a separate and inde- pendent organization anywhere among the Pueblos. It is controlled or managed by lineages or clans among the Western Pueblos, generally by medicine associations among Eastern Kere- sans, and by special moiety associations among the Tewa. Kivas among the Pueblos generally are all-purpose ceremonial structures, and while they have been constructed under the direction and supervision of lineages or clans (in the west) or by village associatioins (in the east), they are used by the various ceremonial organi- zations for rites which affect the whole pueblo or at least a large segment of its population. (b) A council or meeting lodge, larger than dwelling structures, has been reported for the Pima and Papago (Lumholtz 1912: 51-2). How- ever, a tribal cult seems not to be associated with this structure, and while Strong (1927: 39) identifies the meeting-lodge structure with the group-house, fetish, and priest complex of the Western Pueblos, Spier (1936: 11) considers these ceremonial objects as individually owned. The data on Pima-Papag,o ceremonial organiza- tion are unclear and ambiguous, and the sug- gestion of a tribal cult or an association linked with a council house is perhaps impossible to confirm. (c) The four men's associations of the Hopi (Eggan 1950: 93) may also be considered prop- erly as tribal associations, since every young man must belong to one of these. Women are not members of comparable organizations. There is no structure specifically associated with these men's organizations. 2. Ceremonial moieties. (a) Tanoan dual divisions. All Tanoan Pueblo groups appear to have some kind of dual or moiety organization with the population of a pueblo divided between the two. The data on moiety membership and organization are far from clear in most of the Tanoan pueblos, but among the Tewa, at least, membership includes both sexes and is validated by initiation at the ages of six to ten. A child is usually initiated into the moiety of his father, but this is no,t an invariable rule. There are numerous instances in which a child has been initiated intol the moiety opposite to that of his father. Adults who wish to change their moiety may also pre- sent themselves for initiation when the moiety which they want to join is conducting its initia- tion rites. It is important tol note the special moiety associations, one for each moiety, in connection with Tewa moiety organization as a whole. These associations are the managing or con- trolling organizations of the moieties, each re- sponsible for its own moiety and membership selected from its own group. The functions and duties of these moiety associations are religious and governmental and differ from either medi- cine or the special associations for war, hunt, and the like discussed under village associations below. Membership in a moiety association is open to both men and women, but only men become officers in the organization. The head of each moiety association is the moiety chief, each Tewa pueblo, as a consequence, having two village chiefs who alternate in the religious and governmental rule of the pueblo semi- annually. Each moiety association has a room where its sacred objects and paraphernalia are stored and where the association members assemble in periodic retreats. For large village ceremonies conducted under the direction of the moiety association, the communal kiva is used (Dozier 1960: 151-8). (b) The dual divisions of the Eastern Kere- san Pueblos are apparently dance or game groups, not organizations of the kind reported for Tanoan Pueblos. These dance or game groups are managed by medicine associations and use the large dual kivas. While members</page><page sequence="8">DOZIERP] SOCIAL UNITS AND ARCHAEOLOGY 45 of a Keresan pueblo consider themselves as be- longing to one or the other kiva, there is appar- ently no initiation to validate membership nor is there an associated organization like the Tewa moiety association restricted to each division and solely responsible for its welfare. (c) The Pima-Papago moiety organization may have resembled the Keresan dual divisions, a division primarily to afford opposing, groups for dances and games. Our data are too unclear and ambiguous, however, to reconstruct the nature of the Pima-Papago moiety organization. 3. The lineage or clan-segment groups of the Western Pueblos have already been mentioned. It is important here to note that in all of the Western Pueblos there was definitely a room set apart in each pueblo which contained the fetishes and other sacred objects of the lineage or clan segment and where members occasion- ally convened for ceremonial purposes. 4. Village Associations. All the Pueblos have a number of associations whose membership is open to the whole village and cross-cut moiety or lineal kinship identities. The concerns around which associations have been organized may be briefly stated as the fol- lowing: (1) curing, (2) hunting, (3) warfare, and (4) clowning. The last is concerned pri- marily with the minimization of inter-village conflict, and the clown associations act essen- tially as social control groups. While specific curing associations have not been reported in the recent literature on Hopi, these apparently existed in the past. Curing, however, was probably never a central concern of the Hopi. Their most pressing anxiety is the weather, and the elaborate development of the Katcina cult among these people is understand- able from this point of view. The Katcina cult everywhere among the Pueblos is primarily a moisture-inducing or weather-control organiza- tion. Zuni has associations definitely associated with curing, while Acoma, Laguna, Jemez, and the Eastern Keresans have made it the core of their religious organization. Among the Tewa, two or three curing associations have been re- ported, but the moiety associations and those of hunting and war appear to have been more important. Among the Southern Tiwa, Isleta has two curing associations of the Keresan type, but no information on curing associations is available on Sandia pueblo. Curing associations have not been reported for the Northern Tiwa in which hunting and warfare are far more im- portant than elsewhere among the Pueblos. Despite the absence of curing associations, all Pueblos consider the activities of Pueblo re- ligious organizations as having curative func- tions. Thus, everywhere the rites of the Katcina cult are believed to bring general well-being to the pueblo and, among Keresans and Tanoans generally, associations are joined in order to be "cured" of an illness or as the result of a vow and subsequent recovery. It is also important to note that curing ritual is always associated with ridding the pueblo of witches and effecting a general prophylaxis. Hunting associations appear among the East- ern Pueblos generally, and while they are not specifically reported among the Zuni and Hopi, success in hunting is associated with rituals serving other primary functions. War associations are present in all pueblos, although they receive major emphasis among the Tanoans. This is understandable since the Tanoan pueblos were nearer the nomadic, war- involved Plains Indians. Clowning activities occur everywhere in the Southwest, but only among the Pueblos are there specific clown associations. They are also apparently absent as an association among the Hopi, although ad hoc groups are arranged for public or semipublic ceremonies. Elsewhere among the Pueblos they are important asso- ciations. Among all Pueblos, established associations have a house or a room where the important ceremonial fetishes and paraphernalia of the or- ganization are kept. These structures are also used for meetings and retreats of the association, although kivas are used for rituals that involve the community. While ceremonial rooms con- taining the association's sacred objects may have originally served as a dwelling, a number of fea- tures are usually associated with them. Mural paintings, either on the floor or on the walls, are common. These rooms are usually at the back where light from the outside is restricted or ab- sent. The equipment of ceremonial associations is similar among the Pueblos. Slat altars may be restricted to Western Pueblos, but such items as a feather-wrapped corn ear, stone figurines of animals, anthropomorphic wooden figurines, ob- sidian blades, odd-shaped stones, and the like are generally the sacred objects forming the ceremonial equipment of a Pueblo ceremonial</page><page sequence="9">46 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 1, 1965 association (Lange 1959: 245-7). Collections of these items found in a room would indicate rather conclusively that it was used for cere- monial purposes, especially if the characteristics outlined in the paragraph above were also found associated with the ceremonial collections. Kivas and other large structures may be bare of mural paintings and equipment, since these structures are used for large communal rituals and are not the property of any one association. Ceremonial associations, even those which man- age or control large cult activities, are small and rarely consist of more than a dozen members. For this reason a smaller structure is usually pre- ferred for the regular retreats and meetings of the association. The above discussion of ceremonial organiza- tions and ceremonial buildings has dealt almost exclusively with the Pueblos. Tribal or village associations appear in profusion only among these communities and, with the possible excep- tion of the Pima and Papago, appear to be absent among other Southwestern groups. CONCLUSION We have attempted in this paper to present a complete inventory in outline form of all the social, political, and ceremonial units described for Southwestern societies. These units appear to have deep historical roots in the Southwest and undoubtedly existed in the prehistoric past. In describing these units, we have indicated whether these units exist as spatially delimited entities or not. With respect to socio-political units, we have indicated which units occur as independent political entities. Not all social units have associated architectural structures, but where these occur we have attempted to indicate the nature of such relationships. It is not always possible, even in a living society whose social structures are known, to make un- ambiguous correlations with the buildings asso- ciaited with such units. For example, the dis- covery of a ceremonial house or room will indi- cate either a lineage or an association unit, but which one of these units is involved would be difficult or impossible to establish. This is be- cause the ceremonial objects used in the two types of ceremonial units do not differ markedly and the rooms in which these objects are con- tained appear identical. The problem is, of course, even more difficult in archaeological sites, since ceremonial objects of the kind used in the Southwest are extremely perishable. While specific social units may be impossible to identify in archaeological sites, still it may be possible to make broader identifications. It would be significant to establish whether a so- ciety in the past was unilineal or bilateral in kin- ship organization, even though more precise information or correlations are impossible to establish. A closer examination of ceremonial structures, especially of the kiva-type structures found in the Southwest, might give us this infor- mation. Were it possible, for example, to estab- lish that Mesa Verde society was bilaterally organized rather than unilineally, the case of the Tanoan Pueblos as original occupants of Mesa Verde sites would be enormously strength- ened.
