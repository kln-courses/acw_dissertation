Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002. 290 pages. $45.00. Michel Chaouli's first book publication is, in the author's words, "about an unexpected encounter between the natural sciences and the theory of poetry at the end of the eigh- teenth century" (1). The "laboratory" of the title refers to the vast aphoristic writing of Friedrich Schlegel that includes literary and philosophical "fragments." In an illu- minating and elegant reading of Schlegel's work, Chaouli focuses on the science of chemistry around 1800 to argue that it provides the "crucial conceptual model" and the "enabling allegory" for a radical transformation of literary poetics, with far-reaching consequences both for an understanding of Schlegel and beyond (2). Schlegel was in fact less familiar with the scientific theories and practices of his time than his friend and colleague Novalis, and other contemporaries. It is howe.ver Schlegel's "dilettant- ism" which, according to Chaouli, allows him to use the concept of chemistry "to develop and practice a form of writing that is experimental down to the letter" (4). In a careful analysis that considers both Schlegel's fragments-their combinations of phrases, words, letters and morphemes-and the essay "Of Incomprehensibility" (Uber die Unverstdndlichkeit), Chaouli details the implications of Schlegel's "chemi- cal project." The result is a unique scholarly work, recommendable to historians of sci- ence and literary scholars alike, that brings a fresh perspective to Schlegel's poetics and their relation to the "idiom of modernity" (1). Chaouli's convincing readings show how the "logic of chemistry" infiltrates Schlegel's essay on incomprehensibility and the fragments. Paying close attention to the role of the components of the word Unverstdindlichkeit, Chaouli recalls that the second prefix, "ver," is associated with "disorientation" and "deviation from the path of meaning" (22). Within Unverstiindlichkeit, "ver" both acts upon and is influenced by certain "combinatorial rules" (24). "Ver" effectively performs the "logic of chem- istry in language" (27) in so far as "ver- processes" conform to a logic of substitution (Chaouli cites both Freud's well-known "ver-" words and the "material contingency" essential to Lacan's understanding of metaphor, 28-29). Thus Unverstdindlichkeit is both "a name for the unexpected ways in which linguistic parts collide and react" and the "illustration, description, and performance" of its own meaning: incomprehensi- bility (26). The chemical materiality of the word-the indelible production of mean-</page><page sequence="2">442 Monatshefte, Vol. 96, No. 3, 2004 ing that occurs within a word, and between words-is important for Chaouli's subse- quent arguments. It allows him to propose a "counter-model" to interpretations of Schlegel's fragments that have tended to discuss the relation of fragment to "system" in terms of part and whole, within a genetic, dialectic, or (mathematically) infinite teleology (34). As an alternative, Chaouli proposes the "operational and material workings of texts" (35); the result is a non-teleological and "nonredemptive notion of the artwork" where "element and combinatorial operation" replace the "spent distinc- tion of whole and part" (35). The problem of mediation between part and whole is central to Chaouli's read- ing of Schlegel's fragments and his argument for the appropriateness of the chemical model. If, as Chaouli insists, there is a "basic openness" inherent to the fragments that prevents closure, then the notion of an organically closed totality does not suffice (85). Rather, the openness of the fragments causes unpredictable effects between texts "that at some point leave behind the author's motivations and wishes" (85) and, occa- sionally, result in the production of nonsense-although Chaouli's examples of non- sensical fragments are not always self-evident, which leaves the question of his crite- ria for a reader's reception of sense or non-sense. It is nonetheless entirely convincing that the unexpected occurrences of combination and separation among Schlegel's texts are best described through the logic of chemistry, because it "provides the concepts and images that situate it just between mechanism and organicism: the theory of at- traction, anthropomorphic and unevenly applied as it is, breaches a gap with mecha- nism, endowing the elements with a simulacrum of life and volition. At the same time, mechanism has not been entirely evaded, for the manifestations of attraction-com- bination and recombination-ultimately rely on a process of mechanical substitution [...]" (106). Not only do Schlegel's writings adapt and transform the discourse of chemistry-the chemical logic also continues to function in its new environment. The implications of how, through combination and attraction, chemistry "acts upon self- descriptions of the poetic process, of the writing and reading of verbal artworks" leads Chaouli to draw comparisons to avant-garde poetry and to reconsider Schlegel's role in modern literature (108). This review can provide only a cursory overview of the argumentation in Chaouli's noteworthy study, and raise only one general question. In Chaouli's inter- pretation, the suitability of chemistry as a model for Schlegel lies in its ability to in- corporate moments of contingency and "chaos." The prevalence of the chemical ter- minology in Schlegel's fragments, and indeed the very way in which individual letters and morphemes act as chemical elements, in turn allows for an incorporation of in- completeness and contingency into the act of poetic creation. Creation accordingly oc- curs not only through the unexpected and emphatically material proximity of single elements, but also-as Chaouli underscores- through the reader's engagement with them. When Chaouli refers to "chaos" in the context of Schlegel's fragments or the field of chemistry, however, he opposes it to the notion of a system (79) and to willful acts of creation (111-112). The objection could be raised that for Schlegel, chaos is not merely the antithesis of system, and that romantic chaos contains its own notion of order. Schlegel's fragments also remove chaos from traditional associations of disor- der to reconfigure it as a transitional figure that encompasses a shift towards greater complexity. Given that the contingent aspects of chemistry around 1800 are central to</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 443 Chaouli's reading, a closer look at the compatibility and differences between "chemi- cal chaos" and "romantic chaos" could perhaps lead to further insights into the en- counter between science and literature. Michel Chaouli's book stands out within the vast field of Romantic scholarship for its originality, erudition, and timeliness regarding current theoretical concerns about the interface of literature and science around 1800. The author's wit and clarity ensure that The Laboratory of Poetry will be an informative and enjoyable read for aca- demics and "dilettantes" alike.
