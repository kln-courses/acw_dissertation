<plain_text><page sequence="1">288 REVIEWS J. Gonda, Visnuism and Sivaism, A Comparison. Jordan Lectures 1969. University of London, The Athlone Press, 1970. 228 pages. This small volume, based on the Jordan Lectures delivered at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London in 1969, is in fact a survey of many aspects of Hinduism from the age of the Vedas to medieval times. The six lectures as originally given by Professor Gonda have been appreciably expanded and equipped with a full apparatus of references and notes, to produce a solid monograph of much scholarly value. The first chapter treats of 'the character of Visnu and Rudra-âiva in the Veda and the Mahäbhärata'. Professor Gonda rejects the older theory that Visnu was originally in some way connected with the Sun, and rather believes that he may even be considered as representing the 'cosmic pillar' (p. 6), a concept hinted at and elliptically alluded to in the RgVeda and more strongly emphasized in the A tharva Veda. The second chapter treats of 'the gods' rise to superiority' and contains important discussions on the Svetäsvatara Upanisad on the one hand, and the Bhagavadg'ita and Mahä-Näräyana Upanisad on the other, the basic texts of the two emergent theistic systems. The author lays much emphasis on the Purusasükta (R. V., x. 90), as influencing both systems, but especially that connected with Visnu. The problem raised in a note (n. 76, p. 152) to the effect that "we are quite significantly not told to whom the oblation was made and what deities were engaged in the rite" of the primeval sacrifice described in this hymn, is, in this reviewer's opinion, not so mysterious as it appears. We believe that the significance of the failure of the hymn to include these details is simply because, to the audience for which it was intended, they were perfectly obvious. The primeval Purusa, oppressed by cosmic loneliness (compare Brhadäranyaka Upanisad I. iv), produced out of himself a mate in the form of Viräj. The firstborn of the couple was a second Purusa, followed by numerous other gods. The latter sacrificed their eldest brother to their father. Admittedly we have no positive evidence to support this interpretation, but it fits the data we have better than any other known to us. Professor Gonda almost reaches the same conclusion (p. 25), but stops short at giving this simple anthropomorphic answer to the question he poses in his footnote. The third chapter, entitled 'Theology' contains much of interest to the specialist concerning the Purânic conceptions of the two divinities, and is noteworthy for a valuable discussion of the Päncarätra doctrine of the vyühas of Visnu. The fourth chapter on 'Ritual' discusses both the domestic rituals as practised by the two sects and the more elaborate temple rituals. The latter aspect of Hindu religious life has received comparatively little attention hitherto, and for this reason among others the chapter is a very significant one. Chapter V, entitled, 'The mutual relations of the two religions', is an important survey of legends, traditions and historical data relevant to the subject. On the tolerance of Hinduism, emphasized in many writings and true in comparison with other religions, 'there is some room for reserve' (p. 92), and Professor Gonda makes much of the 'passive intolerance' of Visnuism (pp. 93-94). His remark that the figure of Harihara, a syncretism of the two great gods, 'never rose to real importance in religious praxis' (p. 108) may be true. The fact remains that images of Harihara aie widespread in South India, where the founder and first king of the Vijayanagara empire bore this name, which is still popular in Dravidian speaking areas, and we cannot believe that the concept of Harihara was wholly with out effect. The very fact that a father should give such a name to his son is indicative of mutual tolerance, and the possession of this name would constantly encourage it. The final chapter, 'Siva and Visnu in folk-lore, myth and literature', is among the most important and interesting, and contains exceptionally rich material on many aspects of the subject not dealt with in earlier chapters, taken from sources of every type and of all periods. We may regret that Professor Gonda has not considered the Siva of the Bengali mahgala-kävyas, demoted from his supernal status as the great ascetic and the primeval dancer to that of the archetypal peasant, with a nagging wife, even sometimes reduced to beggary to provide food for his family. The familiar Siva of rural Bengal is at the opposite pole from the stem Vedic Rudra or</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 289 the all embracing divinity of the Svetâsvatara Upanisad and can only be accounted for as a response to human need, and a reflection of the realities of the human predicament as it affected a particular time and place. The book is the product of great erudition and an encyclopedic mind. It is invaluable to the specialist as a comprehensive scholarly survey in which (if he takes a little trouble) he may find information and ideas on almost any and every aspect of Hinduism. In the parenthesis of the previous sentence lies our major criticism of the book. Omitting the index, the work contains 217 numbered pages. 142 of these form the main text, in fairly small type. Pages 143 to 217, 75 in all, are notes in very small type. These are numbered consecutively through each chapter, and no indication is given of the page of the text to which the note refers. The number of notes per chapter ranges from 135 (ch. I) to 384 (ch. VI). The serious reader, making full use of the notes, is greatly disadvantaged by this system, which is time-consuming and irritating. For the convenience of the student nothing can replace the time-honoured system of giving notes at the bottom of the relevant page. If he is somewhat less well informed on the subject than the author of the book - a university student for instance or a specialist in some other aspect of Indology - he may find a reference to a text given in the form of an abbreviation which he does not understand. He will look for a table of abbreviations, and will find none. Everybody likely to use this book will know such conventional abbreviations as RV or Mbh, but what of W.Z.K.S.O., G GS, SäÄ, and numerous others? The difficulties of the ignoramus are made worse by the fact that the work contains no bibliography. As an example of the trouble caused to the student by this lack we took a refer ence from the end of the book, at random. This was n. 371 of ch. VI, on p. 141. It was not very difficult to find the note to which this referred, since this occurred on the last page of the notes (p. 217). It read 'Cêramân Perumal, Ädi Ula 7, see Jesudasan, op. cit., p. 93.' The reader who knows something about Tamil literature will probably know the book concerned, but what of the student without such knowledge? We worked back through the notes to find the title of the work cited. On p. 214, n. 305 we came across 'Jesudasan, op. cit., p. 65' and hopefully looked further back. Sure enough, on p. 210, n. 198 was 'Cf. e.g. Jesudasan, op. cit., p. 95'. At last, on p. 206, we tracked the book to earth under n. 72 - C. and H. Jesudasan, A History of Tamil Literature, Calcutta, 1961. We did not time the process, but it involved glancing at over 200 notes in minute type. Comment is superfluous, but we commend to authors of learned mono graphs the system now widely adopted by archaeologists and anthropologists, where the reference above mentioned would appear in the main text in parentheses as (Jesudasan, 1961, 93), and the details would be available under that heading in a bibliography at the back of the book. As well as the bibliographical references, which are most valuable and testify to the author's immensely wide reading and erudition, the footnotes at the end of the book contain many comments and additional matter of much importance, which might better have been included in the main text. Some of these are of great length (e.g. ch. V, n. 47, which covers 86 lines of fine type and contains historical references of much significance). Indeed if Professor Gonda had expanded his study to about twice its present length by the incorporation of much of this material into the main body, the book would have been more useful to a wider range of readers and it would have made more pleasant reading even for the specialist. The fault of over-compression may not be so much the fault of the author as that of the publishers, the School of Oriental and African Studies. The cost of publication no doubt had to be covered by the Jordan bequest and financial limitations may have compelled the production of the work in this tightly compressed form. In reading the work we noted only two misprints: 'Vrta' for 'Vrtra' (p. 3) and 'goddesss' (sic, p. 121). There is irregularity in the use of a capital H in 'he', 'him', with reference to divinity. Otherwise the work is very well proof-read. We are at a loss to understand ch. III, n. 316, p. 168, which begins "Cf. Hazra, Studies in the Upapurânas, I, p. 216.
