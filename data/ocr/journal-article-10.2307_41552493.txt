<plain_text><page sequence="1">What The Clerk Saw: Face To Face With The Wrong Man Noa Steimatsky In a celebrated review of Alfred Hitchcock's The WrongMan (US, 1956) in the Cahiers du cinéma^ a review titled (after Artaud) "Le Cinéma et son double," Jean-Luc Godard focuses upon certain close-ups of Henry Fonda. Such images of the human countenance epitomize cinema's capacity, greater than that of philosophy or the novel of our time, says Godard-this on the eve of his own advent into filmmaking-"to convey the basic data of consciousness" (fig. 1). In an ekphrastic feat, Godard dwells on the privileged arena of the face in motion pictures. The contemplation afforded by such close-ups, he suggests, binds revelation to mystery: the visual surface comes to enfold a promise of interiority; aesthetic and ethic intersect in Godard's tracing of how a face transpires on film. Reaction shot and long close-up of Henry Fonda staring abstractedly, pondering, thinking, being .... The beauty of each of these close-ups, with their searching attention to the passage of time, comes from the sense that necessity is intruding on triviality, essence on existence. The beauty of Henry Fonda's face during this extraordinary second which becomes interminable is comparable to that of the young Alcibíades described by Plato in The Banquet Its only criterion is the exact truth. We are watching the most fantastic of adventures because we are watching the most perfect, the most exemplary, of documentaries.1 In the repose, the gratis moment that precedes Fonda's entry into the inexorable machinations of the insurance agency, the police, the law, of psy- chiatric institutions, and of narrative itself, time and space are fairly abstracted in these early close-ups. Béla Balázs has written about such free- dom of spatio-temporal coordinates that allows for the facial close-up to be Framework 48, No. 2, Fall 2007, pp. 111-136.

Courtesy of the author . experienced, paradigmatically, as whole ? The face may be said to counter, in this way, the threat of fragmentation embedded in the workings of cinema, most obviously in framing and editing, as in the work of the actor. In the searching, attentive perusal of that singular object-one distinct from other objects, one that compels as subject- the extended close-up affords Godarďs leap from acting to being, from functional communication or narrative tool to ineffable inwardness, from the instant to the interminable, from optic to ethic. Godard further suggests that such images pierce, as it were, the fabric of cine- matic fiction so that-even in filmmaking as controlled as Hitchcock's-index- ical, documentary contingency works as a guarantee of authenticity, of "exact truth." The "accidental" or "trivial" detail, the subtlest facial motion transpir- ing in time, points toward that singular, irreducible inwardness even as it will not quite contain it or spell it out. Godard's vocabulary of "being" and "essence" aspires to exceed, ox precede, any specific coded content of thought, any paraphrasable expression or communication. But even without Godard's Platonic terms one might concur, as I propose here, that it is a condition of the great cinematic close-up to signal subjectivity in epiphanic terms that exceed, by definition, the readable signs of expression. Namely, formally coded legibility will not do here, but rather a gesturing toward that margin of inaccessibility, toward the hidden: an intimation of interiority only marked by a contingent articulation of surfaces. More than any particular feature or instant that can be encompassed or defined, it is contingency as an index of temporality and change-necessary if not sufficient conditions of subject- hood-that is at work here. Since no "soul" can be fixed, grasped, made avail- able-for that would render it as mere surface and negate it thereby-a 112</page><page sequence="3">What The Clerk Saw layering of evolving surfaces will constitute a promise of interiority, subjectiv- ity.3 It is contingency that, paradoxically, defines here the plenitude of the face as subject, and of the cinematic image as face : a privileged entity in a world of objects, one that cannot be encompassed as sheer exteriority, but only inti- mated in surfaces shifting in contingency. Not every occurrence of the face in the cinema (nor every close-up) makes this claim. Insofar as the face can also be used to establish a space and a set of relations (as across the trajectory of the glance, within or between shots), to communicate and support processes of narration and reading, it is in fact used for the most part as instrument or object. It is just this confrontation with the face as object and the face as sub- ject that compels in The Wrong Man, Godarďs honorific attention to those few precious close-ups-singled out in a film that dramatizes the objectification of identity within a range of modern institutions, a film that also makes salient the workings of cinema in a lineage of instrumental uses of the human face- serves to launch this discussion.4 In the humble realist context of The Wrong Man, Godard has in fact iden- tified a repository of values inherited from western idealist and metaphysical traditions, from the incarnation of the sacred in the Christian icon and from the humanist portrait that condenses identity in the intersection of a social sphere and an absolute individuality. It is the portrait that most emphatically negotiated selective and accumulative values, claiming a qualitative leap from fleeting appearance to essence , and from visual surface to deep truth. While relying on morphological, mimetic, or iconic ties to appearances, the portrait claims to convert the circumstantial detail in its binding of surface form, to figure an order of interiority and identity that exceeds the detail, and that has endowed the art of the portrait with its great force and prestige. Godarďs account of the facial close-up that affords such leaps from temporal or accidental to essential, from perception to knowledge and to the limits of knowledge, thus harkens back to an earlier phase of modernity, in which the human visage still held a privileged post in a humanist hierarchy of represen- tation. His exalting of the close-up would resurrect, for cinema, those cult val- ues that Walter Benjamin's still granted to the human countenance in early photography. For Benjamin, such photographic portraits would bridge the present and the absent (or the hidden, or the dead), the reciprocity of the look and the effect of distance: "For the last time the aura emanates from the early photographs in the fleeting expression of a human face. This is what consti- tutes their melancholy, incomparable beauty."5 Such honorific terms, that may seem outdated in the context of a movie review, come to have a special role in a work that stages a drama of identity and mis-identification in late-modernity. One might ask what survives of the resonant inwardness claimed by the human visage for generations of repre- sentation in a contemporary post-war America, in the gray quotidian world of this film.6 What are the stakes of that singular subject, what special privilege can it still claim in motion pictures: specifically in post-classical Hollywood, 113</page><page sequence="4">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 48.2 when cinematic systems-comprising film formats and screen sizes-are being reconfigured in a hyperbolic, dizzying mass-media spin of image consump- tion? What space remains for the face, what values might it still retain in the advertising and broadcast-ubiquity of toothpaste commercials and "talking heads"? Hitchcock's thematizing of the human visage, and Godard's special homage to this effort, echo earlier transitional phases not only in photography but in film history, when a redemptive potentiality of the face on film perhaps sought to compensate for the decentering of the subject in modernity. One recalls the heightened attention devoted to the face as theoretical figure and cathected image in the 1920s, against the solidification of cinematic narration and the premonitions of sync sound on the one hand, and the flowering of the avant-gardes on the other. Suffice it to mention how the face is exalted, with all religious investment, by Carl Theodor Dreyer, or raised as paradigm for the very workings of cinema by Béla Balázs and Jean Epstein. The powers of the close-up, amplified by magnification and projection, but also by duration-the evolving of expression in time-are weighed against the face's mechanization, fragmentation, over-codification, against its vulnerability in the cinema, and in modernity tout court With the decline of classical cinema it is an upwelling of cinephilia, com- parable to these 1920s precedents, that emerges in Godard's appreciation of the facial close-up in Hitchcock. It pertains to Godard's broader auteuň st proj- ect of legitimizing cinema, as indeed of asserting the possibility of art-but one might even say, the possibility of love, of life-in contemporary mass culture.7 Yet it is also curious that such poetic excursus on the ineffable reach of the cinematic image would be occasioned by a work such as The Wrong Man whose bleak realism-arguably the most severe in Hitchcock's oeuvre- offers no relief in its adaptation of a journalistic investigation of a case of mistaken identity and petty crime. When compared with the réflective, shattering forces of Hitchcock's following film, färfcgo (US, 1958)-the mad love, the woman whose very visage is haunted, twice over, by that of another- The Wrong Man appears as a minor, unresolved (or perhaps too easily resolved), disenchanted work. But the two films can also be seen jointly as a study of identity's transmutation and survival-even if in tragic victory-in the face itself under the pressure of the look.8 With little or no glamour, or humor, for compensation, The Wrong Man dwells, even more directly, on the assault of late-modernity upon the face as an unstable yet persistent marker of identity, caught between the geometrical functioning of the city and of institutional spaces, and their hyperbolized reflection in the grids of incarceration. Certainly, there are other Hitchcock Glms- Suspicion (US, 1941), Shadow of a Doubt (US, 1943), The Paradine Case (US, 1947)-that focus on the ex- change, the mirror-reflexiveness, of guilt and innocence as resting upon a person's unknowability, epitomized in the face, indeed in the beautiful face of the star confronting us as a dense surface. Central to the workings of these films is the camera's unraveling and also its complicity in one of the protago- 114</page><page sequence="5">What The Clerk Saw nisťs glance upon the other. In this way, Hitchcock makes apparent the repressive pitfalls of the objectification of the look: a look that would delimit the other's inwardness-the unknowability that sustains it as subject. Yet lov- ing, desiring, fascinated, repelled, the camera would also promote our appre- ciation of the face's mystery. Joan Fontaine's look upon Cary Grant I Suspicion ), Teresa Wright's look upon Joseph Cotten [Shadow of a Doubt}, Gre- gory Peck's look upon Alida Valli ( The Paradine Case)- the inscrutability of the face in these films forms a dialectic of concealment and revelation, of privacy and identity. It is complicated by an emphatic, indeed narrativized percep- tion oscillating between innocent self-evidence and disconcerting opacity and between recoiling desire and faithless love. No expression is fully read- able or exhaustible in these films which thus train our own look, our attention, even as their conclusion would appear to contract and fix meaning, as befits their genre. Yet they persist in casting doubt on any such reductions, on the full availability of subjectivity to the visual surface-the symbolic coding of meaning. The spectator's shifting relation to the protagonist-beholder's own perception constitutes a pivotal point around which the films revolve and bend, and from which they derive their suspense, their irony, their force, their pathos-all played out in the arena of the face. In these, as in Hitchcock's later films, the reciprocity of guilt and inno- cence, the implication of the greater within the minor crime, the compelling shifts from identification to identity, the loss and recovery of self, or of a face in the crowd-spoke eloquently to post-war, and cold-war, anxieties. Splitting and doubling, as themes and structures, are thus amplified in Hitchcock's work through the 1950s. The Wrong Man offers in this context the most direct critique of the subjugation of the individual to social and institutional scrutiny and, thereby, the threat to identity, under what I shall describe as anthropo- metric measures. But, more than theme and narrative, it is the workings of cinema itself that insinuate such measures of defining and containing the other. They are drawn against that radiant arena of the facial close-up that I introduced through Godard. For one weighs the dialectic of ineffability and legibility of the face against an altogether different kind of legibility: one predicated on systemic scrutiny, on fragmentation and codification. I will posit specifically the regime of the shot/reverse shot as a technique that "pro- duces" the face as highly controlled syntactic token. Although the symbolic structuring and ideology of such techniques have been the much-debated topic of semiotically oriented theories from Lev Kuleshov to Daniel Dayan and after, I wish to focus here on the face's sub- mission and resistance to such basic cinematic operations. This might be explored without presuming to prove or disprove one grand theory or another, and without attaching absolute value to any general technique or fig- ure of film language. Rather, close analysis of a key instance in The Wrong Man, weighed against Godard's claim, will illumine Hitchcock's testing of the roles of the face within cinematic articulations-so often described without 115</page><page sequence="6">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 48.2 regard for this privileged figure. I consider these formal articulations as anthropometric apparatuses: those measuring and classificatory devices by which the human figure has been delimited in a modern visual culture that has come to include photography and cinematography. Allan Sekula has shown how indexical, documentational, and archiving fonctions underlie such anthro- pometric measures in repressive uses of photography, that he juxtaposes with the medium's distinct perpetuation of an honorific portrait tradition.9 While the latter, he suggests, has contributed to the conception, indeed the production of the bourgeois self, the former would brand or level the face in processes of classification-resulting in a generalized typological gaze or an over-coding of features-consistent with the decentering or indeed emptying of self in mod- ernist systems. It is against cinema's implementation of such measures that one commends the resonant, unfolding close-up wherein contingency, and poten- tiality, open up a redemptive space. The sympathetic viewer, perhaps like the inspired diagnostician, will acknowledge the delicate, vulnerable balance of such a space, where subjectivity, intuition, and uncertainty seep through the fractures of the work. In The Wrong Man, Fonda's face, inscrutable to some of his interlocutors, itself comes to constitute such a fracture in the film: a nega- tive entity that cannot sustain him in a mechanistic world of mis-identifica- tions. It can be likened here to the unverifiable, useless alibi. Yet it is this self-same indeterminacy of the not-fully-legible face that will also guarantee Fonda's innocence for the viewer over and against the rigid apparatuses of the police, of a range of institutions, comprising cinema itself. Consider about one minute of film: an economical shot/reverse shot seg- ment that constitutes the first and critical mis-identification of the protago- nist-Henry Fonda in the role of Christopher Emmanuel Balestraro-mistaken for a hold-up man in the offices of a life insurance agency.10 This is not a spec- tacular Hitchcock sequence but is important precisely for its apparent ordi- nariness in the cinematic fabric where it nevertheless functions as the pivotal instant of the plot. A clerk at the counter of the insurance agency notices him. What she thinks she sees will propel Fonda's every move, every gesture from here on through a machinery that incriminates everything it touches. But we too, I will suggest, are in some sense made complicit in the dynamics of this process simply by virtue of seeing and comprehending the transfiguration of the look upon Fonda in this segment. The twenty-shot sub-sequence follows establishing location views of a crowded downtown arcade, then Fonda's pas- sage through the office building corridor. The segment may be divided into two parts: the first (shots 1-15) is characterized by an escalating emphasis on the dynamic of looking and of (mis-)recognition. Importantly, the use of point-of-view configurations, punctuated with Kuleshovian effects-those montage juxtapositions that delimit the potential ambiguity of any single image-posit here a frontal, rigid system of expression, identification, and response that stands out against more fluid, more transparent continuity edit- ing modes. The second part of the segment (shots 16-20), still in shot/reverse 116</page><page sequence="7">What The Clerk Saw shot, settles into that more traditional flow that opens onto the rest of the sequence at the insurance office, to which I will not attend in this analysis. (Shot numbers below, corresponding to the sub-sequence as just defined, should be differentiated from the bracketed figure numbers that refer to illus- trations. The duration of shots is indicated roughly, and only where it is of special interest.) Shot 1-sidelong view of Fonda entering the insurance office; waiting. Shot 2-establishing shot that approximates Fonda's point of view of the office space: in the foreground a clerk is busy with a client; in the background others are seen at work between the confines of the counter and the windows. Shot 3-from about the same axis of the establishing shot but on a differ- ent scale: medium shot of the clerk whose name, "Miss Dennerly," is printed at her window. Fewer details, no longer focused, remain of the office back- ground. Miss Dennerly's dark hair, brows, and lipstick on her large mouth, all stand out against her complexion (Hitchcock would not put a blond in this position). Her dark knit top against the white collar of her blouse contributes to the graphic contrasts of the image, amplified by the bars of her window. While the client signs a document the clerk wrings her hands, looks up, and we gather that she catches a first glimpse of Fonda. Shot 4-similar to shot 1 but from further left, now explicitly the clerk's point of view, as suggested by the intrusion of the bars. Beyond the first client, Fonda is enframed from above the knees, right hand in his coat pocket. Possi- bly it is in response to the clerk's strong glance that he averts his eyes to look around the office. Shot 5-shots are now shorter as tension builds up in this two-second, medium close-up of the clerk from Fonda's POV. She too averts her eyes, giv- ing the impression that she is thinking, remembering: all this is quite fleeting in the brief shot that nevertheless clearly conveys the contours of a highly coded face-to-face interaction. Only a subtle disturbance marks here the serv- iceable, functional politeness that is the qualification for Miss Dennerly's job in its corporate setting. The dark vertical bars at her window now almost fill the frame, matching other verticals in the background-cabinets, windows-so perfectly that it seems as if Miss Dennerly's first proper "portrait" here is utterly defined by this geometrically organized space. Her anxious face appears quite enclosed between two bars, which are synonymous with where her cheekbones meet her hair, while a third bar in the middle of the frame divides her face just off-center. Shot 6-about one second-clerk's POV as in shot 4. The client in the foreground speaks but we don't attend to her nor to what she says since the weight of the shot/reverse shot already lays heavily upon Miss Dennerly's attention to the stranger, Fonda, static but palpably lurking in the wings. Shot 7-Fonda's POV axis, as in shot 5. After flashing a parting smile to the first client-a smile that, despite its largeness at the mouth inflects no other part of her face-the clerk steals another glimpse at Fonda. 117</page><page sequence="8">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 48.2 Shot 8-clerk's POV, as in shot 4. As the client leaves, Fonda steps for- ward. We note how contained and unchanging his expression is: perhaps the discomfort of rigid bureaucratic context for a man-a bass-fiddle musician in economic difficulty-who must apply for a loan. His withdrawn expression, or inexpressiveness, is possibly interpreted by the clerk as ambiguity, and may thus appear suspicious, or even hostile.11 Alas, in noticing this we are, however unwillingly, putting ourselves in the clerk's shoes: though we don't know yet the precise content of her nervous look, and though Fonda remains innocent to us, we see what she sees, quite simply, and this renders him an object of perusal. Shot 9 (fig. 2)-about one-second reverse shot set up like shot 5: Miss Den- nerly is completely still, petrified. Due to a slight tilt of her head the bar divid- ing her face is not quite centered about the nose and mouth. Because of this, and the fall of light, a subtle dissymmetry becomes distinct between the two halves of her face. The angle and lighting are not sufficiently distortive, however, to create a properly expressionistic counter-pattern against her face, that would have possibly afforded a clearer statement (on this point contrast with figs. 6-7 that I discuss below). But this is not quite Expressionism nor noir, the key light is modulated by a fill in this image of the realist banality of daily interaction. The distortion is subtle and therefore uncanny, making each side of the clerk's face appear to be directed at a slightly different angle, the mouth at a different height on each side of the bar. Each half of the face seems to bear, thereby, a some- what different expression while it becomes increasingly evident that Miss Den- nerly is putting an effort into containing her sense of recognition and dread behind a polite mask. We might observe that, even as she might imagine an ambiguity in Fonda's impassive person, it is she who appears more deeply- almost schizophrenically-marked by it than he is. Shot 10 (fig. 3)-clerk's POV, slightly tilted up to contain Fonda who is approaching the counter, left hand reaching into his breast pocket and pausing there for a brief but palpable instant just before the cut. One is not certain how to interpret this pause: whether it occurs in the world of the story or in the narration [histoire or réciij. The former-the character Manny's half-conscious hesitation before the clerk's intense look-would be signified in the latter. But an almost palpable sense of artificial punctuation in this pause suggests that it might also be an empty signifier of sorts, only register- ing frozen, dilated cinematic time to allow for our registration of the gesture as emphatic object of perception (and mis-reading) in the reaction shot that is to follow. Shot 11 (fig. 4)-one-second shot; the staccato brevity and stillness of shots here effect a mechanical rhythmic thrust that peaks at this point. Back to Fonda's POV but closer. Miss Dennerly is static except that she now lowers her glance from what would be Fonda's face toward his chest. The vertical bar is quite centered on her mouth and nose but less so between the eyes, so the dissymmetry shifts to the upper part of her face. The background is 118</page><page sequence="9">What The Clerk Saw Figs. 2 &amp; 3 .The Wrong Man (Alfred Hitchcock, 1956). Courtesy of the author. almost lost in this close-up. Such focalizing and decontextualizing is what so often suggests a shift of spatial order in the close-up (often amplified by the use of lenses). It radically dissociates the detail, yet claims for it a world all its own. Such fragmentation supported the workings of Eisenstein's intellectual montage in the Kuleshovian tradition. Here it also displaces us from a realis- tic to a conjectural psychic arena contrasted, however, with the floating inwardness of the close-ups praised by Godard. Pascal Bonitzer would say at this point that the gaze truly takes over the look, delimiting its objectsiinder^a repressive psychic order.12 119</page><page sequence="10">Framework: The Journal of Cinema 8c Media 48.2 Figs. 4 &amp; 5. The Wrong Man (Alfred Hitchcock, 1956). Courtesy of the author. Shot 12 (fig. 5)-this one-second shot seems too close to be an accurate optical rendering of the clerk's POV; it conveys an almost subjective, hyper- bolized perception, with the strong foreground of the bars giving it emphasis. Fonda's face is now cropped, the frame almost entirely contained by his chest as displaced object of attention; his left hand reaches into his breast pocket to continue the halted motion of shot 10. The artifice of the temporal distention between shots 10 and 12 make salient, retroactively, the empty yet charged time of the clerk's close-up in shot 11, like a wedge effecting spatial and tem- poral pressure around it. 120</page><page sequence="11">What The Clerk Saw Shot 13-two-second shot identical to 11: the clerk stares as if petrified; time is palpable in a way that extends the wedge of shot 1 1 ; the stasis, brevity, and accumulation of these shots halts the release of action. The shot/reverse shot draws out here in linear succession what I would infer is a dense simul- taneity in the diegetic world. This propels the shot/reverse shot beyond the fluidity of the classical transparent style, towards a rigid mechanistic order: one that renders the views of the clerk as reaction shots and renders, as object, that to which she reacts. Indeed the shift from face to chest might sug- gest to us that it is the man's bodily gesture that now projects up to the face, as it were, and marks it for mis-identification. We can trace here the super-added workings of a Kuleshovian effect: something not present in the image but emphatically implied. While the clerk's face is not entirely neutral, insofar as this is possible per the Kuleshov experiment, her expression is amplified and specified vis-à-vis Fonda's chest, headless, itself objectified to an extreme. Exceeding what the acting offers, we now read dread in her face, whose ver- bal equivalent is, quite clearly, "this man is reaching for a gun." Shot 14-Fonda's chest again: his left hand pulls out a document and offers it to the clerk. Shot 15-two-second shot identical to 11 and 13: the clerk looks back up. We note a partial relief in her look, as if she now breathes again after a halt. But these changes in her disposition are so subtle and her face so tense that one might ascribe them, again, to a Kuleshov-effect: an expression that we read as bouncing from the object of her look, onto her face. Namely, because we have already put ourselves in her shoes, yet a folded piece of paper rather than a gun has been produced, we read relief in her face. It is in such insinua- tion of our reading process into the mechanism of the shots-this despite the fact that we knew full well that there is no need to fear guns or aggression on Fonda's part-that the draconian workings of the sequence make themselves apparent. We could not but "participate" in its production of meaning, in the clerk's reading, even as we know it to be false. Shot 16-in this second part of the segment we note a shift of registers via a sidelong two-shot from inside the clerk's space. The conversation finally begins, and so the shots are not quite so brief as they have been. With this break up of the tight frontal alternation, there is a sense of spatial relief from the confined point-of-view restriction of the face-to-face, and the shift to a more fluid, over-the-shoulder exchange. Shot 17-over Fonda's shoulder as the clerk responds; office background is now distinct again as the space is less tight; the slightly higher angle releases an area without bars at the top of the frame. Shot 18-over the clerk's shoulder, lower angle view of Fonda as he talks. Shot 19-same as shot 17: Miss Dennerly talks. Shot 20-Here follows a more complicated, longer, mobile take that marks the end of my segment leading to the remainder of the sequence wherein Miss Dennerly spreads her suspicions among her colleagues. The 121</page><page sequence="12">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 48.2 shot starts off like shot 18; then the clerk turns around to face the camera, which shifts to accommodate her movement. The pause she takes before actually walking to the back is extended enough to allow for a clear trajectory of altering expressions. This is our first view of Miss Dennerly's face without the bars, yet her face still appears somewhat distorted as the lighting casts unflattering shadows over her brow, nose and lower lip. We see her expres- sion now radically change from what had been the self-contained polite dis- position she presented to Fonda, to a private expression that blends dread, exhaustion, and even sorrow or suffering. She closes her eyes while she takes a breath, and opens them again to a clear expression of determination, which she acts upon by walking into the depth of the office toward one of her col- leagues; the camera pans left to follow her movement. This shot covers an entire range of thought, emotion, expression and action, clearly narrativized and carried to a conclusion: the clerk asserts her (mis-)identification, which will now be shared and strengthened by social coercion- or simply, conta- gion. The entire group of insurance clerks will now join in Miss Dennerly's distorted perception whose structure is closely knit in this sub-sequence with the logic of the shot/reverse shot. The shot/reverse shot regime evokes two distinct but related domains: firstly, quotidian face-to-face interaction within a given social context. The other is our own disposition vis-à-vis the screen, bound but not always syn- onymous with the unfolding of identification, knowledge, complicity within the filmic interaction. The face-to-face rituals of daily life sustain the basic condition of sociality: the face is a token whose expressive order one sustains, Ervin Goffman observes, as "an image of self delineated in terms of approved social attributes."13 But we only take the face as such a token insofar as it can be incorporated within a discursive system. The order of expression in this domain, therefore, is not from the inside out (namely, not really expressive even if accepted as such), but transpires along a syntactic plane of exchange. Our habits of recognition, reading, and response at this public, social level certainly inform the cinematic articulation of shot/reverse shot as of the reac- tion shot: the cinematic face-to-face or face-to-object are both mediated by formal structures of identification, quite codified and conventionalized. These modes of articulation have to some extent trained viewers in reading the face within given parameters, thus offering reassurances of containment and knowledge. They channel and determine expression, subordinating it to nar- rative or discursive context; they render it functional; the vocabulary of responses they afford is broad but not infinite in that they sublimate and con- tain the face's excess: its impenetrable mystery, and therefore its threat. The mythical Kuleshov experiment dwelled on such operations of read- ing the face, of delimiting its meaning by context and across the cut: neutral expression of Moszukin, then plate of food; Moszukin, then a child, etc. The Kuleshov effect postulates that the face does not make its claim directly, does not project at us in the immediacy of the shot. The supposed neutrality of the 122</page><page sequence="13">What The Clerk Saw face in this experiment is matched by an investment, on the part of Kuleshov and his followers, in the representative type-social, regional, professional, etc.-that amplifies a clarity of classification and control of meaning. Facial expression transpires in the K-effect on a syntactic level of montage, that organizes the face-object or face-face configuration as a lexicon of cinematic characterology comparable to more or less elaborate physiognomic sys- tems. 14 According to Pudovkin's account of Kuleshov's experiment, the read- ing of expression is retroactive, predicated on a succession of relays.15 Facial expression, identification, identity , are understood, then, as second-level oper- ations read into an impassive shot, a baseline image that precedes, hypotheti- cally, linguistic articulation proper. It is only in the deliberate joining of two separate shots that, according to Kuleshov's teaching, expression transpires. In fact, the K-effect is predicated upon a misreading of two contiguous images, yoked as a single articulation: the face is thus inserted in a discursive system that fuses and produces it as expression. The retroactive nature of this operation-Moszukin's face was neutral, or ambiguous at most, then the reverse shot stepped in to adjust and fixate its meaning-implicates that mis- recognition is in a sense built into the system. The fast-paced shot/reverse shot in the Hitchcock segment thus shifts and controls our attention and reading, even as we witness at the same time the unfolding of the clerk's own misrecognition and hasty judgment in the diegesis. The point-of-view camera placements along a rigid 180-degree axis, the maneuvering of K-effects dictating so emphatically our reading of the clçrk's thoughts as refracted from her perception of Fonda, his palpable hesi- tation given an extra temporal beat-all demonstrate the intrusive, prescrip- tive powers of film language when so masterfully maneuvered by Hitchcock. Indeed, we cannot but read what it dictates, even as it comprises ambiguity or dimensions of thought and expression that exceed a character's own implied consciousness at particular points. Miss Dennerly thinks she recognizes something in Fonda, and our recognition of this makes us at one and the same time complicit in her suspicious and anxious stare, since we see what she sees and can put ourselves in her shoes, even as we implicitly trust Fonda's inno- cence and authenticity, established earlier in the film in such honorific close- ups as described by Godard. Simultaneously, the way in which we see her seeing while taken up, technically, from Fonda's point of view, exceeds what he perceives-for even if he may seem (by K-effects) somewhat nervous or perplexed by her intense look, he is still ignorant of the suspicion that we already see tainting him. His features maintain through much of the film that impassive evenness, a constitutional disposition that seems to shield him, to some extent, throughout his ordeal. To do nothing and to do it well is Hitch- cock's measure of his ideal actor. Indeed, expression seems to bounce off Fonda and ricochet onto others marking them instead: the clerk (as further described below), the wife (Vera Miles)-one recalls the turning point in the latter's devastated experience when she throws a hairbrush at Fonda, hitting a 123</page><page sequence="14">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 48.2 mirror in which only the broken reflection of his face finally appears to regis- ter, in removed optical doubling, the unfolding crisis (fig. 6). Also, the camera registers this rebounding of expression off Fonda's impassive surface: one thinks of the famous revolving shot over his face that seems to hang in the shadows of his jail cell (fig. 7). Godard points out how such camera work in its abstract optical notation takes up Fonda's consciousness from the outside, as it were, turning it into expressive motion while leaving the actor's face rela- tively free of emoting or acting. Indeed, one witnesses here a radical outcome of Hitchcock's treatment of Fonda: a separation between actor and action, face and expression, or their overtly synthetic joining as predicated exclu- sively, and explicitly, on optical and cinematic devices. At the same time we witness, in the course of the sub-sequence analyzed here, the clerk's own face rendered progressively distorted- as if effected by her own misreading, and amplified in the harsh editing rhythm and formal parameters of the shots. Within the technocratic setting of the office with its mechanical typing sounds, Miss Dennerly's face is under duress, as if itself interrogated, tortured under the lighting, the shallow focus, the graphic con- trasts of the mise-en-scène that endow these shots with an almost cartoon-like flatness, further dominated by the bars traversing the entire frame, like a grid without beginning and without end, seeming to pertain as much to the film- making apparatus as to the realistic setting (cf. fig. 4). The clerk's face is, in effect, set in an anthropometric configuration that makes subtle dissymme- tries stand out, rendering every shadow, shift, or nuance as distortion and error vis-à-vis a rigid spatio-temporal framework. Despite its basic symme- try-a traditional parameter of wholeness and harmony-the human face is not a mechanical entity that lends itself to such extreme measures without cost, and except when certain techniques make it so: techniques that test the otherwise nuanced, impressionable, ineffable dimension of the face as it stands out among objects, among images. A correspondence is suggested here between Hitchcock's organization of the clerk's face in a grid-like formal containment that arrests, limits, and dis- torts the unique mobility of expression, and between the restrictive, highly regimented shot/reverse shot and the maneuvering of K-effects in the sequence. Jointly, the spatial formal features and editorial devices may be juxtaposed with the honorific close-up, its eliciting of singularity and con- tingency, described earlier. Jointly, they posit a cinematic equivalent of anthropometric practice, that long tradition of regulatory and measuring apparatuses by which to contain and evaluate the human form and subjugate it to institutional control. In this they harken back to a long visual culture, one whose landmarks include the emergence of "the modern subject.'' Quite specifically in response to Descartes's Les Passions de l'âme of 1649, Charles Le Brun devised a visual lexicon of facial expressions, ingeniously organized in a closed system of differences vis-à-vis a fixed grid. A neutral expression in "tranquility" formed a baseline from which principal facial coordinates-chin, 124</page><page sequence="15">What The Clerk Saw Figs. 6 &amp; 7. The Wrong Man (Alfred Hitchcock, 1956). Courtesy of the author. mouth, pupils, brows in repose-corresponded to the horizontals and verti- cals of the grid. All other expressions diverged, even if in subtle ways, from that abstract graphic base in a manner that could be described or measured in relation to the grid (fig. 8). Le Brun's diagrams contributed, as well, to the establishment of the Academy as modern institutional framework for the visual arts, promoting the authorized control of representation and reading of the human form. But anthropometrics was principally employed in the new disciplines of the social sciences, and it is there that photography and cinematography find their correlatives. A century after Johann Kaspar Lavater's physiognomical 125</page><page sequence="16">Framework: Th© Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 48.2 fig. 8.

Courtesy of Réunion des Musées Nationaux/Art Resource, New York. studies, Cesare Lombroso proposed massive criminological classifications of face and body parts in L'uomo delinquente (1897). Photography enters Lom- broso's project as it does the influential work of Francis Galton, father of eugenics, and of Alphonse Bertillon, who developed identity charts and crimi- nal portraits that survive in classifying and identification procedures to our time (fig. 9). A variety of anthropometric apparatuses were thus used to regu- late, rationalize, and systematize the photographic act Within a particular series, spatial parameters were pre-defined so as to allow both the generalized evaluation of the group and the registration of deviance against the more or less abstract grid. Anthropometrics could serve diverse instrumental applica- tions in techniques of surveillance and social control, engaging graphic, statis- tical, diagnostic tools in subjugating the human form within prescribed and precise scénographies. The calculation of camera and object position, dis- tance, scale, angle, backdrop and lighting, radicalized a move already inherent in photography: for the photographer is himself reduced to part technician, part clerk in these systems. In direct or implied relation to an objective grid, identity and difference were to be measured within and across groups. In his superimposed, processed photos, Francis Galton dispensed even with the 126</page><page sequence="17">What The Clerk Saw Fig. 9.

Courtesy of New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services. camera's capacity for precise differentiation, as his techniques deliberately effaced singular features, minimizing contingency, to produce a synthetic pho- tographic equivalent of statistical averages: 8 cases of criminality superim- posed to produce one of several composite types; 20+36 cases of consumptive faces to produce a composite of 56, etc. (fig. 10). 16 Anthropometric practice goes beyond cataloguing here. It joins individual likenesses in synthetic wholes that reduce any unique markers distinguishing the single exposure, this so as to render salient and calculable innate physical traits, to extract some broader natural and self-evident "truth," or its presumed corresponding moral 127 tW.

Elements inert in the single image are retrieved as an underlying com- mon essence or universal feature driving the criminal man and woman, the physically or mentally ill, the politically subversive, or the racial other. Social configurations, pressures, and circumstances are grasped as optical surface, propelled by the photographic support to a new order. Early cinema experimented, fitfully, with anthropometric culture, yield- ing a few curious cases. The American Mutoscope and Biograph Company's Photographing a Female Crook (W. McCutcheon, US, 1904) is set in a police sta- tion's photographic gallery, where two policemen and a photographer make efforts to seat and keep a woman still so as to have her picture taken. As this brief, 40-second film progresses, the woman struggles and distorts her face wildly, presumably to defeat identification (figs. 1 1-12). v One counts among the props and instruments that would contain her a photographic backdrop and stool facing the movie camera, as well as a still camera set up on the right and included in the movie camera's initial field of vision. But, in the broader anthropometric conception suggested here, I would also include the dolly-in camera movement towards the woman, tracking from long shot to medium close-up. It seems to be principally against this steadily, perhaps threaten- ingly approaching movie camera, perched to document, to grasp if not to devour this woman at every scale, as whole and as face, that she responds with increasingly violent struggle and facial gesticulation: a reaction that makes evident the repressive dimensions of this visual interrogation. Not only anthropometric settings and instruments, then, not only the cameras and the men operating them, but camera movement and thereby the formal- izing of time are harnessed as repressive cinematographic measures. The human figure-the woman's body and face-and her identity are to be inserted within a pre-established regime. Such systems for holding in place, observ- ing, measuring, cataloguing the human form would largely deny the range of devices harnessed in the process, and attend to the referent-physique and/as identity-as immediately available surface. These systems have survived and have become, if anything, interiorized, namely taken for granted on all sides of the law, though some of their connotations might have soured following implementations in the Final Solution. Yet we find them persisting, across a wide range of institutions, in the world that followed.18 As Hitchcock's film reminds us, even a routine face-to-face encounter might become, in this arena-in an atmosphere of mass hysteria, be it cold-war America or the con- fines of the nervous grayness of a life insurance office-an apprehensive occurrence full of suspicion and dread. Just by virtue of being photographed within a prescribed scenography such as that of the Bertillon card, one is singled out in the files of the police. Hitchcock's attesting, in interviews, to his innate fear of the police might be associated with the anxious passivity of Fonda's submission to such proce- dures. In numerous shots in the film we witness the placing of Fonda's face, profile and front, within such grids (figs. 13-15). But coupled with this overt 129</page><page sequence="20">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 48.2 Figs. 11 &amp; 12. Photographing a Female Crook (Wallace McCutcheon, 1904).

Courtesy of the author. 131</page><page sequence="22">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 48.2 feature of the mise-en-scène , as already witnessed in the insurance agency, one might also consider the anthropomorphic connotations of some of the basic cinematic articulations in this context, and the oppressive measures that they impose on the human face. We have seen, in the seminal scene at the insur- ance office, the way in which Hitchcock doubles up the theme of mis- identification by subjugation of the face: not only the restrictive setting, not only the projection of a presumably violent memory upon a particular ges- ture, but in the rigidly paced montage syntax itself. Mis-identification is in a sense a result of this multi-faceted configuration of the cinematic apparatus as figured here. In controlling the reading of a fleeting surface resemblance, or of a chance repetition of gesture, it imprints identity upon contingency. Even the film's resolution is triggered this way, as we find ourselves rushing into identification of the "right man": does the climactic superimposition, that artificial play of surfaces, suffice to explain what has come to pass, to judge in a hurry the petty criminal who, we find out, also has children? In an instant Hitchcock reminds us that other lives, entire stories, unavailable domains- material, social, psychic-remain invisible as they continue to pressure the delimited surfaces available to the police, and to cinema. One might say, perhaps, that the threat to freedom, as to the ethic of the face, is imbricated in the mis-identification that partakes in the workings of cinema. Hitchcock's implied dialogue with the police as institution deeply marking our modes of seeing and reading, is woven into the fabric of his cin- ema, as into the fabric of modern identity. Against it one isolates the honorific close-ups praised by Godard. Their temporality is, in fact, distinct. Though they too are edited as reaction shots (to Vera Miles in bed; to the newspaper racing pages) in a way that prescribes the contents of thought, their looser framing and especially their tempered pacing, their contemplative pauses, open them beyond coded action and communication.19 A subtle but crucial margin of interiority and singularity is elicited here in the face's nuanced reg- isters of motion, the eyes' reflectiveness, the delicately unfolding shifts of sur- faces, the respect for contingency. This transpires as the epiphanic intimation of subjectivity that the film yields only by renouncing direct access and con- tainment. What the cinematic close-up represses in the paradigmatic scene of mis-identification at the insurance agency, it might rescue in the honorific mode, in the searching temporality of the extended, deep-yet-impenetrable surfaces, enfolding the hidden figure of interiority that begs to not dissolve in process of reading. It is this enchanting potentiality of the face, its openness and intimacy, its address and its mystery, that we perceive in our earliest view of our mother's features from a distance of some 45 centimeters (the perimeter of infant vision, about the line from breast to face), or in our anxious, sensitized glance upon our children's faces when they are sick, or in some Rembrandt portraits that have the power to intensify perception, to refine and mature our glance, to acknowledge the limits of knowledge, the distance between image and lan- 132</page><page sequence="23">What The Clerk Saw guage. These are not sheer optical or syntactic operations (nor the one forced onto the other) but perhaps a more primal, vital doubt in confronting the searching, yielding dimensions of the face, and of the image thereof: in the magnified but ineffable, projected close-up that illumines our own faces in the movie theater, as we witness Hitchcock's tragic dramatization of a crisis of faith m the epiphany of the human face.

New York: Arno Press, 1972), 61. 3 In emphasizing a margin ot unreadability that underlies the claim of the tace as subject, I am informed by Emmanuel Levinas's notion of the epiphany of the face in its "refusal to be contained" in the visual field. See "Ethics and the Face" in Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority , trans. Alphonso Lingis (Pittsburgh: Dequesne University Press, 1969), 194-219. For a brilliant gloss on Lévinas from the perspective of art-historical questions of "reading" the face and/as image see Joseph Leo Koerner's "Rembrandt and the Epiphany of the Face," Res 12 (Autumn 1986): 5-32. This position may be distinguished from Jacques Aumont's juxtaposition of a "readable" and a "visible" face in Du Visage au cinéma (Paris: Editions de l'Etoile/ Cahiers du cinéma, 1992), 78-79. While the former can 133</page><page sequence="24">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 48.2 be associated in part with the anthropometric model that I develop below, the latter, in suggesting an un-mediated fullness and self-evidence of the face as pure image, is distinct from my emphasis on the withdrawn aspect of the great close- up as special image that intimates subjectivity and agency precisely in refusing full availability and containment. 4 "Instrumental and honorific can be read, tor now, m light ot the given con- text. I attend to Allan Sekula's elaboration of these terms below. 5 Walter Benjamin, The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, Illuminations, , ed. Hannah Arendt, trans. Harry Zohn (New York: Schocken Books, 1969), 226. 6 In his superb study The Object and the Face: Notorious, Bergman, and the Close-Up," Hitchcock: Past and Future , eds. Richard Allen and Sam Ishii-Gonzales (London: Routledge, 2004), 64-84, Joe McElhaney suggests how the post-war close-up, traversing apparently disparate works as Notorious (Alfred Hitchcock, US, 1946) and Roberto Rossellinťs Europa 51 (IT, 1952), registers in the human countenance the signs of suffering and loss of that era: namely, that these close- ups are not only predicates of a film style but that they are historical McElhaney's weighing of the role of the object in Hitchcock vis-à-vis the humanist, expressive charge of the face is in some ways analogous to my juxtaposition of honorific and repressive facial registers. 7 In her foreword to Godard on Godard, Annette Michelson describes the invoca- tion of Plato as Godard's legitimizing gesture. Godard will temporarily excise such gestures in his militant phase: cf. Letter to Jane (Jean-Luc Godard &amp; Jean- Pierre Gorin, FR, 1972) where, in a Kuleshovian exercise, the filmmakers claim that the deep, expressive specificity still granted to the silent movie stars is lost with the proliferation of ¿he talkies wherein every face-from that of Henry Fonda in Young Mr. Lincoln (John Ford, US, 1939) to that of "Hanoi J ane"-can speak, but (claim Godard/Gorin) they always says the same thing: the bourgeois- idealist "I think therefore I am." I dwell on the cinematic faces of Letter to Jane in another essay under preparation. 8 1 he pairing ot the two turns would have been amplihed were Hitchcock to end up with Vera Miles in Vertigo's lead, as was his original plan-sabotaged by Miles's pregnancy. Of course it is now impossible to imagine Vertigo with anyone but Kim Novak. On the films' joint bridging of Hitchcock's "character-centered films of the 1940s and 1950s and the character-effacing films of the 1960s and 1970s," see Paula Marantz Cohen, "Hitchcock's Revised American Vision: The Wrong Man and Vertigo? in Hitchcock's America, eds. Jonathan Freedman and Richard Millington (New York &amp; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 155-172. 9 Allan aekula shows specifically how anthropometric photography is turned repressive when it comes "to establish and delimit the terrain of the other, to define both the generalized look-the typology-and the contingent instance of deviance and social pathology" (italics in the original). See "The Body and the Archive" in The Contest of Meaning: Critical Histories of Photography, ed. Richard Bolton (Boston: MIT, 1989), 345. 10 I take the common liberty, throughout, to dub the protagonist of The Wrong Man Fonda, since the star's fame transpires so clearly through his role, while minor parts are often more securely designated by their screen roles. 134</page><page sequence="25">What The Clerk Saw 11 Manny Färber diagnoses Fonda's disposition in roles starting from the 1940s as follows: "Fonda starts bearing down on the saintly stereotype with which writers strangled him. In a typical perversity, he edges into the bass-playing hero of The Wrong Man with unlikable traits: nervousness that is like a fever, self-pity, a crush- ing guilt that makes him more untrustworthy than the movie's criminal popula- tion." "Rain in the Face, Dry Gulch, and Squalling Mouth" in Negative Space: Manny Färber on the Movies (1971; expanded edition New York: De Capo Press, 1998), 177. One might see Farber's 1966 observations as foreshadowing Fonda's role as sadistic criminal in Once Upon a Time in the West (Sergio Leone, IT/US, 1968), a film in which the extreme close-up introduces, paradoxically, an ironic distance in its hyper-proximity. 12 Cf. Pascal Bonitzer, Hitchcockian Suspense, in Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Lacan ( But were Afraid to Ask Hitchcock ), Slavoj Žižek, ed. (London: Verso, 1992), 15-30. Bonitzer reminds us, in reference to other Hitchcockian close-ups, of the lesson of Lacanian film theory: that in its passage to conscious- ness, which sets the narrative going, the look falls from a sort of primal innocence that might have characterized it in early cinema. In its fall it is stained; it becomes a gaze. While the broad historical truth of this observation is debatable, it is use- ful in tracing the psychic imbrication and complication of the look. 13 Ervin Goffman, Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior (New York: Anchor Books, 1967), 5. 14 In "Some Historical Footnotes to the Kuleshov Experiment, Early Cinema : Space, Frame , Narrative, , ed. Thomas Elsaesser (London: British Film Institute, 1990), 247-255, Yuri Tsivian describes the efforts invested in the control of meaning, via the unity and boundary of frame, scale, shot, and the film itself since the earliest days. These efforts, Tsivian shows, responded to film viewing experience, and informed the cultural adaptability of film language as expressed in the Kuleshov experiments, which "correct" the ambiguity built into the close- up. In "Kuleshov's Experiments and the New Anthropology of the Actor," Silent Film, ed. Richard Abel (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1996), 45-67, Mikhail Yampolsky maps the adoption of physiognomic models in acting techniques that informed the organization of the actor's body and face in the Kuleshov experiment, as part of other Soviet artistic traditions of the early 1920s. 15 V.l.

Allan Sekula s detailed discussion and his distinctions between the diverse projects of Galton and Bertillon. On Galton's composite portraits see also David Green, "Veins of Resemblance: Photography and Eugenics," The Oxford Art Jour- nal 7.2 (1984): 3-16. One might read against Galton's practice the famous super- imposition effect toward the end of The Wrong Man, where we find a succinct but not quite satisfying solution to the case of mistaken identity, but one rising by sheer coincidence, and resolving none of the fundamental conditions and forces that have allowed for such errors to occur. 17 Charles Musser informs me that such views of criminals contorting their features to avoid identification were exploited for what was deemed as entertainment value, and also reproduced as stills in daily papers. The diverse, albeit brief 135</page><page sequence="26">Framework: The Journal of Cinema &amp; Media 48.2 descriptions of Photographing a Female Crook in the literature are not entirely con- sistent among themselves, nor with the version that I have seen. See Kemp R. Niver, Early Motion Pictures: The Paper Print Collection in the Library of Congress , ed. Bebe Bergsten (Washington DC: Library of Congress, 1986), 248 and Tom Gun- ning in Before Hollywood: Turn-of the- Century American Film, eds. Jay Leyda, Charles Musser, et. al. (New York: Hudson Hills Press in Association with the American Federation of the Arts, 1987), 127. Another film, shot by the same pho- tographer, A.E. Weed, in the same place on the same day, and following a simi- lar description, is A Subject of the Rogue's Gallery (US, 1904). 18 When 1 hrst got aub Resident photo ID card it stipulated a specihc angle ot the head so as to expose the right ear in classical anthropometric tradition. Related identification procedures have perked up after September 11, 2001, when the press reported on recent advances in computerized anthropometrics and "lie detection programs" that enhance surveillance and screening strategies. With these the FBI, CIA, police, or airport security personnel, are trained in hundreds of hours of facial expression and identification techniques that revive some of the old Galtonian classifications with the purpose of picking out a face in the crowd: a nervous infiltrator, a terrorist, an Arab. See Malcolm Gladwell, "The Naked Face," The New Yorker (August 5, 2002): 38-49. 19 Although both the early shots descnbed by Godard and the insurance agency mis-identification may be classified as shot/reverse shot segments, it is against that basic trope that their differences stand out. Another way of putting it is via Gilles Deleuze's sense of how the shot/reverse shot might convert an "affection image" to an "action image," translating the mental relation, which Deleuze sin- gles out as epitomized in Hitchcock, to a reduced spatial configuration: see Cin- ema 1: The Movement-Image, trans. Hugh Tomlinson and Barbara Habbeijam (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1986), 107, 203. In a seminar on related topics my students suggested that one might read in this light a juxtapo- sition in these sequences between the clerk's accelerated breathing, signaling cri- sis, versus the rhythm of thought in the honorific close-ups. 136</page></plain_text>
