The " Mythology of the Greeks and Romans," as it has heretofore been taught in our school-books and used as material in modern literature, is in truth neither Greek mythology nor Roman mythology, but an incongruous mixture of the two,? Grecian fable with Roman nomenclature. So long as it was purely a matter of fancy and of literary concern, there was no great harm done. Everybody understood what was meant by the Olympian Jove, the Eleusinian worship of Ceres, and the temple of Diana of the Ephesians, better indeed than if we had said Zeus, Demeter, and Artemis. But with the present century has come in a new school of philology, which has abandoned the merely literary treatment of such themes for one rigidly scientific, and which has discovered that names are not an indifferent matter in science ; in fact, that, in such a field of inquiry as this, the name is often the key to the entire investigation. Max Muller, indeed, the leading authority in this new school, asserts " that mythology is simply a phase in the growth of language," an assertion in which we may rec ognize an important truth under an exaggerated form of state ment. Perhaps there was a little pedantry in the first zeal for calling the Greek divinities by their right names, but it was at bottom a genuine, if blind and pedantic, striving for scientific accuracy. And now that Comparative Mythology has come up as a science, we can see that one of its first and most essential requirements was to distinguish with precision between the religious systems of these two related peoples, and that the</page><page sequence="2">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 31 first step towards this was to use names rightly. So long as Poseidon was called Neptune, and Ares Mars, the foundations of the new science could not be laid. This first step has now been wellnigh accomplished. Very few persons of any pretension to scholarship insist any longer upon confounding together two independent sets of deities under common names. But while the Grecian gods have re covered their true names, and Grecian mythology has thus been placed upon a sound basis, the discarded Roman names have ceased to have a meaning to us. We know Zeus and Hera and Athena now ; we have known them all our lives, it seems; but who are Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva ? Roman mythology is hardly better known ? at least among English and American scholars ? than it was fifty years ago; that is to say, hardly at all. When mythology was purely a matter of art and literature, so that, as remarked above, it mattered very little whether the god of fire was called Hephaistos or Vulcan, Roman mythology was also a matter of little consequence, for the reason that it afforded very little material for art and literature. More over it was not strange that the best scholars were almost wholly ignorant of it, for the reason that the facts with regard to it were so hard to get at, scattered in out-of-the-way authors, or hidden under a mass of irrelevant matter. The Roman poets for the most part do not give us Roman mythology, but Greek. Even Ovid, in his Fasti, ? the only work of Roman literature which makes a pretence to embody the traditions of national mythology, ? draws quite as much from Greek as from Roman sources ; and it is often impossible to say, even where he appears to be giving us pure Roman legend, whether he is not, after all, making up a story. Thus the graceful story of Anna Perenna, in the third book, is evidently his own work, suggested by the identity of the name in the fourth book of the JEneid with that of the Latin goddess; and all we get from this long episode, towards an understanding of the genuine Roman faith, is the description of the usages and habits of a popular festival, from which we may draw our own conclusions as to its origin. In the scientific discussion of mythology, on the other hand,</page><page sequence="3">32 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, Italian traditions are of the first importance. Indeed, it may be doubted whether their scientific value is not enhanced by the fact that they were not subjected to the distorting and transforming influences of poetry. Hartung, in his Religion der Griechen, points out that the original and genuine traditions of Greek religion are to be sought, not in the poets, but rather in such works as the Itinerary of Pausanias. The poets and artists took the crude myth and moulded and modified it to serve their purposes; Pausanias dryly describes institutions and usages of immemorial antiquity, and from these we can learn what the people actually believed and how they wor shipped. Now our authorities for Roman mythology are mostly of this character. It was for the most part let alone by the poets, save in the single instance of Ovid's Fasti, a work which is of priceless value in this investigation, for the reason that it gives us just what Pausanias does, a description of forms and customs. What it contains more than this may be of service and may not; at any rate, it needs to be sifted ; but these de scriptions are genuine. Next to Ovid's Fasti, in our materials for this study, will perhaps come Augustine's De Civitate Dei, which contains a summary of the views of Varro, the most learned Roman antiquarian, introduced by the Christian writer for the purpose of being refuted. Besides these we have little more than scraps and fragments. Varro's treatise De Lingua Latina is partly preserved, and is of the highest value, so far as it goes. Of Verrius Flaccus, the next antiquarian in merit, we have a portion of an abridgment by Festus, in a ter ribly corrupt and mutilated condition, and an abridgment of Festus by Paulus Diaconus. The commentary of Servius upon Virgil comes next in order ; he was not himself an antiquarian of the rank of Varro and Verrius, but he copied many a curious bit of information into his hotchpotch of a commentary. So did Aulus Gellius too, whose Noctes Attica? may indeed rank above the commentary of Servius. Besides these, we have some late writers, like Macrobius, a few allusions and state ments in that poet of genuine learning, Virgil, in Cicero and the elder Pliny, and not a few inscriptions of value. These materials, it will be seen, are, after all, not so very scanty ; it is a* question whether we are not, in some respects,</page><page sequence="4">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 33 better informed as to the original religious institutions of the Romans than as to those of the Greeks. Neither is this material altogether so dry and unedifying as might be sup posed ; nor is the Roman mythology wholly destitute of stories of love and adventure, such as those in which the Greek mythology abounds. Many of their gods were married ; Mars and Nerio, Neptune and Salacia. Saturn and Ops, were faithful pairs. The pleasant story in Ovid (Met. XIV. 623), how Ver tumnus sought the love of the shy Pomona ; how, changing his form, ? he was the counterpart of Proteus, ? he appeared suc cessively as a reaper, a mower, a vine-pruner, a soldier, etc., and then as an old woman, who lectured and warned the maiden, finally in his own youthful form, and won his bride: this story and numbers like it may be dressed up by the poet, but can hardly have been wholly invented by him. Nevertheless, it must be confessed that stories like this are not characteristic features of the Roman religion; that it did not encourage flights of the imagination, but was serious and earnest, running to observance and ceremonial rather than to fable. It was remarked by an eminent German scholar that the Romans had no mythology, only sacred antiquities (got tesdienstliche Alterthumer), ? an assertion which has enough truth in it to serve as a general description. This expresses the most fundamental distinction between the Greek and Roman religious systems; but it will be interesting, and indeed essential to our discussion, to inquire in what further particulars they differed from each other; that is, what different development the two related nations gave to the same original faith. In a previous article * I described this original faith, com mon to the ancestors of both Greeks and Romans, as starting in " the immanence of the divine power, inhabiting, inspiring, and vivifying every living thing, nay, every inanimate object, and every action of life ; .... a sort of pantheism, ? a belief, not in one God pervading all nature and identified with nature, but in millions of gods, a god for every object, for every act." Pandemonism, Preller calls it. In anthropomorphizing, or in vesting these divinities with personality and human shape and * North American Review, for July, 1869. vol. cxiii. ? no. 232. 3</page><page sequence="5">34 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, attributes, consisted the development from fetichism to poly theism; and it is the special excellence and glory of the Greeks that this anthropomorphism was so complete, and that the Greek Olympus contains no man-bulls or cat-headed monsters by the side of the perfectly human Zeus, Apollo, and Aphrodite. The Centaurs and Minotaurs of Greek mythology were few in number and of subordinate importance. The Romans lacked the high aesthetic sense which preserved the Greeks from the puerile bestialities of Oriental mythologies. On the other hand, they had their own protective in an even higher and nobler quality. Their conservative and practical temper led them to cling to that primitive mode of regarding the divine power which the Greeks lost sight of in the indi viduality of their deities. The Greeks, out of the original numina, or Sal/j,ove$, had created their marvellous Olympus of living gods and goddesses, ? their ideal of perfect humanity. The Romans, on the other hand, were capable of only a very moderate degree of anthropomorphism. Their gods were per sons, it is true, but they were not, as a whole, invested with any very marked human attributes; and it was found easier to keep up the habit of imputing individual acts to distinct deities, than to extend the sphere of activity of the gods they already had. Hence the multitudinousness of their pantheon. No other nation, perhaps, would have conceived of a special divine spirit, existing merely for the purpose of causing Hannibal to turn his back on Rome when already in sight of the city. The Romans indeed might have given the credit of it to Jupiter or Mars, and invested him with a new attribute and built him a new temple; instead of that, they chose to build a shrine, on the spot which Hannibal last occupied, to the Deus Rediculus, the god who caused the turning about. But the most re markable illustrations of this practice are found in the Indigita onenta, or books of religious formulas, and other remnants of the old worship. Every act of life had its peculiar divinity, to be invoked in its proper time and place. There were some sixty or seventy of these, who presided over the growth of the human body alone, ? Vagitanus, who opened the mouth of the infant for his first cry; Cunina, who guarded the cradle ; Educa, who taught the infant to eat; Patina, who taught him to drink;</page><page sequence="6">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 35 Ossipago, who knit the bones, etc. Then for husbandry, there were Nodutus, who caused the joints of the stalks to grow; Volutina, who wrapped them in their leaf-sheaths; Patelina, who opened the wrappings, that the ear might come out in due season ; Hostilina, who made the crop even in its ears; down to Runcina, who presided over the pulling of the roots from the ground. These were not strictly gods, even in the polytheistic sense of the word, but. nnmina, or attendant spirits. But above all, ? and this is the source of what is purest and noblest in the Roman religion, ? they delighted in recognizing the divinity that inspired every virtuous thought and act, ? the worship of abstract qualities. It was a necessary accom paniment of this characteristic, that harmful spirits and vicious qualities should also be recognized and worshipped; but it is a remarkable and honorable fact, that the Romans were never led astray by this to an overweening service of evil deities. They propitiated Vejovis, the bad Jove, and Febris, Fever, and Mephitis, Malaria ; but there was no devil-worship or service of Moloch : so far from it, indeed, that they did not even feel sure who Vejovis was, although they regularly sacrificed to him. (Ov., Fasti, III. 435, ff.) The Romans had an un wavering faith that the powers of good were superior to those of evil. This worship of abstractions went probably far be yond that of any other mythological system, and is the most striking and characteristic feature of the Roman theology. Other mythologies possess it in a degree ; the Athenians built temples to Unwinged Victory and to Health. But the Romans, besides Victoria and Salus, had Honor, Pudicitia, Fortune, Pax? Libertas, and Concordia among their most honored deities. Indeed, several of those gods who rank as personalities were abstractions at the outset. Minerva was the abstraction of mental power (mens), Mercury the abstraction of traffic (rnerx), Janus the god of opening Qjanua), and Saturn the god of sow ing (satus*). On the other hand, while the Romans went far beyond the Greeks in the worship of abstractions, they lost, in a much greater degree, the worship of elementary spirits, which had been in reality the starting-point of each theology. Ouranos, Gaia, Okeanos, were reverenced by the side of Zeus, Demeter,</page><page sequence="7">36 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, and Poseidon; but the Romans had only the personal gods, Jupiter and Neptune, Bona Dea and Dea Dia, while Tellus (rather than Terra) did not hold a high rank in their worship. This fact illustrates the different development of the two peo ples. Both started with the worship of elementary spirits ; in both the spirit of the firmament, Zeus or Jupiter, naturally took the first rank, and other spirits, of water, fire, earth, etc., were personified by his side. Then when these had become completely anthropomorphized, and their origin was forgotten, while their power was reverenced, the imaginative Greeks re peated the same process, and created new deities of earth, sky, and water by the side of the old ; while the practical Romans turned themselves to the contemplation of the human virtues, or provided for the whole range of human sentiments and actions, by regarding each of them as produced and controlled by an indwelling spirit. The Romans again, aside from what passed as history, lacked the demigods and heroes, who make so large a part of the Greek system, and who, one would think, would be pecu liarly congenial to the Roman temper of mind. And, as a matter of fact, this proved to be the case; for among the earliest Greek deities whose worship was engrafted upon the Roman tradition were demigods like Hercules and the Dios curi, heroes like jEneas and Evander. Almost the only native Italian deity who is reckoned among the heroes is Semo Sancus, or Dius Fidius, who had two or three temples at Rome, and who was frequently identified with Hercules, for no other apparent reason than that both were commonly adjured in oaths, ? me hercule, me dius fidius. But why the god whose very name, Fidius, implies that he was the spirit of faith, and of whom not a single legend is narrated, ? who is as purely an abstrac tion as Concordia or Spes, ? should be called a hero, it is at first sight hard to see. His second name means nearly the same as his first; semo is spirit, sancus is usually connected etymologically with sanctus, holy. But Sancus or Sangus was really an object of tradition, being the alleged founder of the Sabine nationality; and it was natural, perhaps, that he should be identified with this favorite of Greek tradition, Hercules, whose name and worship were spread far and wide along the</page><page sequence="8">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 37 Mediterranean. Just as he was identified with the Sabine Sancus, his name superseded that of the Latin Recarenus, the slayer of Cacus in the original legend ; and in the East he was adopted by the Phoenicians as their god Melkarth under another name. This conservative temper, which, as we have seen, was the source of what was best in the Roman religion, by keeping alive the faith in the immanence of the divine power, had, how ever, its weak side, and was equally the source of the worst peculiar feature of this worship, that is, its excessive formality. All Roman history illustrates this. The service is vitiated, and the games must be renewed, says Cicero (Har. Res. XI. 23), " if the pantomimist makes a sudden pause, or the flute player interrupts his blowing, or the boy stumbles or loses hold of the chariot, or lets the reins fall, or if the presiding edile makes a slip of the tongue or a false motion with the cup of libation " ; cases were known in which the same rites must be begun over again fifty times before they were accomplished in due form. Or take the formalities required in the case of the Flamen Dialis, or priest of Jupiter, next the Rex Sacrificulus the highest priest in the hierarchy. (Aul. Gell. X. 15.) In the first place he must be of pure patrician birth, of parents married by the ancient patrician ceremony of confarreatio; he himself must have married a virgin by the same ceremony, and his wife bore the title of Flaminica. He must not ride a horse, nor look upon a marshalled army outside the pomcerium (that is, except when it entered the city in a triumphal procession), nor take an oath, nor wear a solid ring, nor a knot in any part of his clothing. His hair must not be cut except by a free man, and the cuttings of both hair and nails must be buried under a tree of good omen. He must not touch nor even name a goat, uncooked meat, ivy, or beans, nor must he touch dough when fermenting. A bound prisoner brought into his house must be set free, and the chains re moved, not by the door, but by the impluvium, or opening in the roof. So if a person who is to be scourged falls as a suppliant at his feet, the scourging must be remitted for that day. He must not touch a dead body, nor take part in a funeral, nor enter a tomb. He must not strip his body, except under a roof.</page><page sequence="9">38 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, The legs of his bed must be smeared about with mud, and he must never be away from it three nights together. Unquestionably all these points had a meaning and an object once, and are simply an illustration of forms kept up with strictness long after they had lost their vitality. What is pecu liar to the Romans is the multiplicity of them, and the painful precision with which the smallest details were insisted upon. The religion of the Greeks and Romans consisted, as Zumpt has pointed out, not in doctrine, like that of the Hebrews and Persians, but in faith and ceremonial, and its very life de pended upon maintaining the forms pure and unimpaired. Now that we have discussed the great distinctive features of the Roman religion, let us proceed to consider some special classes of religious ideas, which will best illustrate the char acter of their faith and worship and the points of resemblance and contrast with those of the Greeks. We shall then be pre pared to glance at their religious system as a whole, ? their theogony and Olympus, if we could use these words for so jejune a creation, ? and to trace the history of their religious ideas and forms of worship. It has been said that the primitive Roman worship was directed to the divine spirit dwelling in an object or inspiring an action or process of nature, ? the thought that lies at the foundation of fetich worship. We meet indeed with not a few real fetiches in the developed worship of the city. Of this nature were the plants sacred to the several gods, ? the oak of Jupiter, the myrtle of Venus, the " sacer Fauno foliis oleaster amaris" (Virg. Mn. XII. 766) ; and the animals sacrificed to them, ? the boar to Mars, the cow to Diana, the sow to Ceres. Such was the sacred fire in which the divinity of Vesta was conceived to reside. So with the ficus ruminalis, under which Romulus and Remus had been found in infancy, and which was believed to have been afterwards conveyed to the co?ni tium by divine power. Still better examples are the flint-stone kept in the temple of Jupiter and used in oaths (per Jovem lapidem was a common oath. Cic. ad Fam. VII. 12) ; the lapis manalis, kept by the temple of Mars, and carried through the city when rain was needed; best of all the lance (or lances) of Mars, kept with the sacred shields in the Regia.</page><page sequence="10">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 39 It was a most portentous omen when this lance moved of its own accord, and one to be consulted upon by the highest powers of the state. When war was declared, the commander entered the sacred building, struck the shields and then the spear, cry ing out, Mars, vigila ! u Mars, awake! " Neither is the prin ciple of that form of fetich wanting which has received the name of totem, ? a fetich appropriated to a tribe and trans mitted by hereditary descent, as is found especially among the North American Indians. At l@ast among the cognate Italian tribes we recognize the Hirpinians as receiving their name from the wolf (hirpus) of Mars, and the Picenians from the wood pecker (picus) of Mars, which had guided them to their new homes. The Hirpi Sorani, or wolves of Soranus, will be men tioned presently. There are some traces among the Romans of that serpent worship which plays so important a part in some religious sys tems. The genius, or indwelling spirit of the man, appears under the form of a serpent, as is illustrated by the occurrence when JSneas sacrificed at his father's tomb (JEn. V. 84). Propertius (IV. 8) describes an oracle at Lanuvium, to which the seekers approached down a dark opening, and fed hungry serpents with the hand. If the maiden is chaste, she returns in safety, and the husbandmen joyfully shout that the year will be a fruitful one. Of wilful indecencies the Italian religion was, in its original forms, almost absolutely free, although many such grew up in after time. Fairies and elves, the graceful creation of Northern mytholo gies, were foreign to the notions of the Greeks and Romans. The Greeks made up for this with a wonderful abundance and variety of nymphs and other beings, completely human in bodily aspect, and with no magic powers, but the living em bodiment of the simple powers of nature. The Roman equiva lent for the nymphs were the Viree or Vires. These were joined with Diana in the worship at the Nemean sanctuary, but are otherwise a wholly shadowy existence to us, not even hav ing made their way into poetry ; their name, however, has been developed into the better known virgo and virago. The com panion male beings, on the other hand, the fauns and silvani, are better known, and represent for us not merely the Greek</page><page sequence="11">40 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, satyrs, but the weird creatures of Northern mythology. Fau nus, " the favorer," is the old god of nature, a chief personage in the earliest mythology. As having the ear to the secrets of nature, he is a prophetic god ; as the father of the Italian theogony, he was transformed into an early king. In his whole nature he corresponds very closely with the Greek Pan, and, like him, was multiplied, in the popular conception, into a class. The name, therefore, which at first was that of the chief god of nature, was afterwards applied to the lesser gods of the wood and field, corresponding in this sense to the Greek satyrs. The same is true of Silvanus, always an inferior being to Fau nus. The fauni and silvani, then, were often playful or mali cious beings, like the dwarfs, alps, and scrattles of Grerman fairy-land. To protect against their pranks, the children wore the bulla and other amulets. Especially was Silvanus to be dreaded after the birth of a child ; and mother and infant were protected by three deities, Intercidona with an axe, Pilumnus with a mortar, and Deverra with a broom, to personate whom three men went about the house at night with axe, mortar, and broom, cutting, pounding, and sweeping the thresholds. There were also the vampire strigce, who sucked the blood of infants in the cradle. Against these Carna or Cranea, the goddess of the hinge, was invoked, who touched the threshold and door-posts with a bough of arbute, sprinkled the door way with charmed water, and threw out the entrails of a young pig, saying " Birds of the night, spare the vitals of the child ; a little victim is slain for the little one. Take this heart for his heart, I pray, this flesh for his. We give you this life for a better one." Then she puts in the window a twig of white thorn, the plant sacred to Carna, and the child is safe. The Romans did not originally incline to mysteries, such as those of Eleusis, Samothrace, Imbros, and Crete, in which the Greek religion abounded. Leaving out of consideration the rites of Cybele, Bacchus, and others, which were purely exotic, and of late introduction, there were still, however, a few native mysteries very early in origin and very widely reverenced. There were secret rites to Angerona, in the temple of Volu pia, ? in allusion, says Hartung, to the anguish which is</page><page sequence="12">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 41 turned to rapture. The best known, however, and most im portant are those of Bona Dea, the good goddess, whose very name is a mystery, although she has been identified with Fauna, Ops, and others. It is probable that she represented the fructifying powers of the earth, and her festival was on the first day of the month of increase (Maius), whence also she was called Maia. Her mysteries, however, were celebrated in December, in the house of the highest magistrate, by women alone, and appear in later times to have acquired a wild and orgiastic character. The sacrilege by which Clodius managed to witness these rites, and the uproar it made in the state, can only be compared to the famous mutilation of the statues at Athens. It is too familar an event to need more detailed mention ; neither need we conclude that the fearful picture drawn by Juvenal of the license of these rites is even approxi mately true for the times of the Republic. Although mysterious rites did not much abound among the Italians, yet there were several mysteries, that is, secrets, ? the secret name of the city of Rome, which was concealed in order that no enemy, by learning it, could call forth (evocare) its protecting deities ; and those of several classes of gods, to guess which a great deal of learning and ingenuity has been expended. We may safely conclude that what was a secret then will be a secret now. And in reference to such classes Preller says (p. 549) : " In general it must be assumed that all gods of lesser rank which were conceived as pure spirits (darno nenarlig}, and for this very reason were named and invoked only as classes, originally had no personal names, either in Greece or Italy." It will be worth while, however, to exam ine a little more in detail points which are so characteristic of Roman modes of thought. The DU Consentes and DU Involuti appear to belong rather to the system of the Etruscans, who were peculiarly fond of dark and sombre articles of faith. And yet it appears clearly from Varro, that the Consentes had temples in Rome (L. L. VIII. 71), and that their statues, twelve in number, ? six male and six female, ? stood on the Forum. They might, therefore, be identified with the Twelve Olympian Gods; but we are expressly told that their names were unknown, and we</page><page sequence="13">42 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, must bear in mind that this idea of twelve chief gods is Greek, not Roman. The list of them, given by Ennius, ? Vesta, Minerva, Ceres, Juno, Diana, Venus, Mars, Mercurius, Jovi', Neptunus, Vulcanus, Apollo,? includes several, as will be shown presently, who are essen tially foreign deities. On the whole, it seems most rational to assume that there was really no secret here. The Dii Con sentes were the council of Jove,.having no individuality, and therefore no names of their own. The Involuti are conjec tured by Gerhard to be represented in an Etruscan relief, as two partially veiled figures, sitting back to back, with the backs of their hands placed before their mouths. We shall not prob ably be wrong in identifying them, as Gerhard does,* with the Fates, as a council higher than that of the Consentes. The Etruscans taught (Seneca, Nat. Qu. II. 41) that Jove hurls his first thunderbolt alone, to inspire terror ; the second, which hurts but heals, by the advice of the twelve gods (the Con sentes, no doubt) ; the third, which blasts and destroys, ad hibitis in consilium dis, quos superiores et involutos vocant. The names of the Penates were also a secret, both those of the city, and especially the great gods worshipped at Lavinium, which ^Eneas was supposed to have brought with him. But the word is of pure Latin derivation, and it is not likely that the alleged connection with Troy or Samothrace was anything but a theory, started when the Greeks and Romans came into con tact with each other along the coast, like the whole story of the colonization of ^Eneas, and the stories of Evander, Hercules, Sancus, Catillus, etc. Very likely the Penates of Rome were the secret gods of the city, connected with its secret name. Another much disputed name is that of the Dii Indigetes, gen erally rendered the native gods, a rendering which is correct as far as it goes. It is applied to such characters as JEneas and Caeculus, the native heroes, ey^co/no?, of Lavinium and Praeneste respectively. But it appears to imply something more than nativity, or even divinity; it carries with it the con ception of the spirit or numen?the genius ? that dwells in the place and the people,?a connection almost as close as that of father of the race. * tlber die Gottheiten der Etrusken, Anm. 17.</page><page sequence="14">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 43 A still more puzzling class are the Nov ensiles or Novensides. In the formula of invocation used by Decius when about to devote himself (Liv. VIII. 9) they are mentioned: " Jane, Jupiter, Mars pater, Quirine, Bellona, Lares, divi novensiles, di indigetes, divi quorum est potestas nostrorum hostiumque, diique manes, etc." These are all deities either of high rank, or peculiarly Roman, or specially connected with the act of self-devotion. Janus was invoked first, as on all occasions ; then the three great national gods Jupiter, Mars, and Quiri nus; then the goddess of war, the deified ancestors, the heroes, the shades. From the position of the novensiles, by the side of the indigetes, these have been supposed to mean respectively the native gods and those which were originally foreign, thus deriving the word from novus, new ; this is Hartung's view, and was held by the ancient writer Cincius. Varro and Piso, how ever, say that they were Sabine gods, and the name has been found on inscriptions in the Sabine country. It seems more natural, therefore, to derive the name from novem, nine, and to consider them a special group of deities introduced from the Sabines, whose functions had some natural connection with the act of devotion. It does not seem likely that these two terms would be used on this occasion in order to include all existing deities, especially after so peculiar a list has been enumerated as that given ; and at any rate it would be strange that we have no other instance of the use of novensiles and in digetes in this distributive sense. May it not be doubted also whether the native, indigetes, would not have stood first in this case ? I am inclined, on the whole, to the view of Manilius, that they were the nine gods who, according to the Etruscans, had the power of hurling the thunderbolt, ? a meaning quite appropriate to their occurrence in a formula of devotion. In nothing were the Romans more distinguished from the Greeks than in the mode of seeking the will of the gods. They had no Apollo, whose frenzied hierophants uttered ora cles under a divine afflatus. But the formal auspices which the magistrates consulted, and which were interpreted by the college of augurs, were among the most characteristic of the institutions of the state. Everything was simple and definite, and reduced to rigid rules. It was not all birds, at all times,</page><page sequence="15">44 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, that conveyed the will of the gods, but only certain ones, when the magistrate consulted them with well-defined ceremonies. It was to him only that the auspices were sent; the augur was but the skilled interpreter who was called in to explain phe nomena, but who had no power himself to seek for the signs. This resulted from the fundamental principle that the state rested upon the divine will, as declared in the auspices. The auspices belonged to the citizens as a body, that is, to the patricians; the chief magistrate for the time being had them in his possession; but whenever there was a vacancy, the aus pices, the embodiment of sovereignty, returned to the patrician body, where they remained until a new magistrate, installed with the consent of the gods, was again the depositary of them. The Roman or patrician auspices, thus carefully and jealous ly maintained, were, however, but the specially Roman develop ment of the Italian system of augury. The plebeians had their auspices likewise, and the other Italian nations, different from the Roman, but no doubt analogous. They observed, for instance, different birds, and gave a different interpretation to the same sign. Individuals, too, could interpret for them selves the signs that came in their path, and there were many other methods of ascertaining the future besides the flight of birds, the appearance of animals, and the path of the thunder bolt. Another public oracle, the Sibylline Books, must not be forgotten; but it will be treated of in another place. The haruspices, a low class of Etruscan soothsayers, who foretold by consulting the entrails of animals sacrificed, must be care fully distinguished from the augurs, who were a body of states men and gentlemen of the highest rank. The serpent oracle at Lanuvium has already been spoken of. Faunus, the good god of nature, was wont to whisper his secrets in dreams, or call them out to his worshippers, as is described in the seventh book of the iEneid (v. 81). Sanctuaries of Fortuna were like wise frequented for this purpose. The most famous was at Prse neste, where lots were drawn from a box. It has been surmised that the elegantly engraved boxes, peculiar to Prsenestine art, were in some way connected with this oracle. Another was at Antium, celebrated by Horace in the thirty-fifth ode of the first book, ? O diva gratum qua? regis Antium. Of the superstitions of the later Republic and the Empire I shall speak presently.</page><page sequence="16">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 45 From the general religious conceptions we will pass to the consideration of the special objects of Roman worship, and the changes in their religious institutions and ideas. Probably there is no nation which illustrates the transformations of faith so well as the Romans: first, because in their case these trans formations were very extensive and remarkable; secondly, be cause we are unusually well informed in regard to them, and can trace them with great distinctness and accuracy. The primitive religion of the Romans consisted -of two ele ments, ? that which they inherited from their remote ances try and possessed in common with other Aryan peoples, and that which was developed for itself by the Italian race after its separation from the Greeks. To the first class, besides the general conceptions which have already been spoken of, be longed the worship of Jupiter (Zeu? irarrjp), Juno {Aiwvr)\ and Vesta {^Earla), and perhaps nothing more. Even here the Romans had hardly more than the names in common with the Greeks ; the conceptions and forms of worship were wholly their own. The other class, that of distinctively Italian deities, forms a peculiarly interesting group, one which is, however, not always easy to analyze. Many of these, whose worship was of great importance and popularity in the earliest times, were afterwards forgotten or cast in the shade by Greek and other foreign divinities. For instance, it may fairly be claimed that any god who had a flamen, or special priest, held a toler able rank at one time, although it would not necessarily follow that he had the highest rank. Now we do not possess the complete list of flamens, but we know that besides the three of chief rank, ? those of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus, ? and those of Vulcan, Flora, and Pomona, the gods of fire, flowers, and fruits, there were flamens of the river god (Volturnus), the harbor god (Portunus), the goddess of the Palatine, the origi nal seat of the city (Palatua), of Carmentis, a goddess of spells and song, and of Furina and Falacer pater, whose functions are not known. It was in the sacred grove of Furina, not of the furies, that Gaius Gracchus was killed; Falacer pater is connected by Hartungwith the Etruscan word falandum, heaven, as being therefore only another name or another form of Jupi ter. This is all that is known, or conjectured, about these</page><page sequence="17">46 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, two deities; but it is a fair inference that all these, even those who were quite insignificant or actually forgotten in after time, were leading gods in early ages. Besides these gods who dwindled or vanished in historical times, there were not a few who were insignificant at first, and acquired high importance afterwards by being identified with leading Greek deities (as Venus, Ceres, and Mercury), or whose attributes were entirely altered in this identification (as Liber pater and Saturn). For Saturn was originally only the god of sowing, and he had nothing in common with the Greek Kronos, except the tradition of great antiquity. It was related that he had reigned in the most distant periods of time, before Jupiter was known ; but no original Italian myth made him the father of Jupiter. Jupiter, as the god of the heavens, was the chief god in early as in later times ; and the vine, which depends so much upon the weather for its fruitfulness, was under his special charge. Bacchus was only a late importation from Greece, and Liber pater, with whom he was in after times identified, had origi nally nothing to do with the vine or with drunkenness, but, with Libera, presided over the bearing of children. But if Jupiter was recognized as the greatest of all gods, Mars was the favorite object of worship, the national god, not only of the Romans, but of the Italian race as a whole ; just as a Catholic people, without impugning the supremacy of Jehovah, will take St. James or St. Denis as its special patron and pro tector, and the object of its dearest affections. Mars, therefore, although the god of killing, was hardly the special god of war in early times. This character was merged and lost out of sight in that of the national god of a nation of shepherds and husbandmen ; and he was " pre-eminently re garded as the divine champion of the burgesses, hurling the spear, protecting the flocks, and overthrowing the foe." (Mommsen, Book I. ch. 12.) Bellona, on the other hand, was the special impersonation of war. Mars, in this point of view, was grouped with Faunus, Picus, Silvanus, Pales, and other deities of nature ; while as civic god of the old Roman city upon the Palatium, he was associated with Quirinus, his duplicate, the Mars of the hill city upon the Quirinal.</page><page sequence="18">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 47 Jupiter, then, the chief god of all, with Mars and Quirinus, the patron deities of the two cities, on the Palatine and the Quirinal, which were united together to form Rome, were the great triumvirate of early times. By the side of these there were worshipped Faunus, the good god of nature (in February), Terminus, of boundaries (also in February), Ceres, the goddess of growth, and Pales, of the flocks (in April), Neptune, of the sea (in July), Consus (from condo) and Ops, of the harvest (in August), Vulcan, of fire (in August), and Saturn, of sow ing (in December). Add to these Janus, the god of opening, and Vesta, the goddess of the hearth, and we have, with the omission of some less important names, the original Roman pantheon. What is most striking in this is the number of purely Latin names of great importance in after times, which are wanting. At this time Juno was perhaps nothing but the numen of women, the counterpart of the msls genius; Minerva was only an indigitamentum, of memory; Diana, a leading Latin goddess, was hardly recognized in Rome ; Venus was of quite subordinate importance ; and Mercury was hardly known, if at all. The changes made in after time in the objects of worship may be referred to three heads, ? Italian influence, Greek in fluence, and Oriental influence. For although the Romans were themselves a pure Italian people, and possessed those elements of faith which were common to the Italian race, yet each community, like Rome itself, had its special rites and divinities, many of which were, one after another, adopted by the Romans. Etruria has the credit of having supplied the Romans with many articles of faith ; but the more is known of its people, the more barren its institutions appear. The Capitoline trio, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, whose worship marks the Tarquinian dynasty, is often referred to Etruria; but Varro expressly tells us (L. L. V. 158) that they had a chapel upon the " Old Capitol" (on the Quirinal) earlier than that upon the Capitoline. At any rate we have seen that Juno was a primitive Grseco-Italian goddess, and was certainly known before this time, at least as the indwelling spirit of women. Minerva, too, is a purely Latin name (niens), and her worship was specially in the hands of the Nautian gens,</page><page sequence="19">48 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, which was of Alban origin. Varro (L. L. V. 74) reckons her among the Sabine deities. It seems impossible, therefore, to say what religious movement was connected with the establish ment of this trio. But whatever it may have been, these three, from this time, appear at the head of the Roman Olympus. The political bearing of the fact is suggested by Marquardt's theory (Vol. V. p. 47), that this new institution was to form a religious centre for the now united state, corresponding with the important constitutional changes that took place at this epoch. As the patrician city had its Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus, the plebeians had the temple of Diana on the Aven tine. It was the work of the Tarquinian dynasty to unite these two elements into one ; and with this work the founding of the new temple and worship may have been connected. At any rate, it is at this period that both temples were founded, ? that of Diana and that of the Capitoline Jove. To this period belongs, likewise, the commencement of the custom of having images of the gods, according to Varro's statement (Aug. Civ. Dei. IV. 31) that the Romans worshipped the gods one hundred and seventy years without images. As to Diana herself, it is hard to determine her precise character, further than that she seems to have been a feminine form of Janus (Dianus). She had a renowned sanctuary at the Lake of Nemi, near Aricia, and it was probably from the similarity of her worship here to that of the Tauric Artemis that it came about that Diana was identified with Artemis. The Rex Nemorensis, or priest of Diana, held his place by the sword, ? by killing his predecessor in single combat; and he must maintain it in the same way, ? an exploit which none but runaway slaves undertook in later times. When the power of Rome grew, and she came to absorb all her neighbors into herself, many other local deities were in corporated into the Roman system. The Penates at Lavinium and Fortuna at Praeneste and Antium have been already spoken of. The Sibyl Albunea at Tibur, and the Dioscuri at Tusculum, belong rather to a later period. One of the most important of this class was Juno Sospita Mater Regina, who had a famous sanctuary at Lanuvium and lesser ones at Rome; it was in her temple that the serpent oracle described above</page><page sequence="20">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 49 was found. This goddess has perhaps more reality to us than most of her class, from her mention in Cicero's oration against Milo, and from her peculiar statue in the Vatican, with shield and spear, clad in a goat-skin, with pointed shoes, and a serpent at her feet. Still another was the worship of Soranus on Mount Soracte, who, as a god of light, worshipped on the top of the mountain, was identified with Apollo, ? Sancti custos Soractis Apollo (Virg. iEn. XL 785). But he was also identified with Dis Pater, god of the lower world, by reason of a sulphurous vapor which exhaled from a hole in the mountain-side, and of the peculiar rites with which he was worshipped, partly de scribed by Virgil in the passage cited. For once when the service was going on, wolves came and snatched the flesh of the sacrifices ; and when the shepherds pursued, they were led to this cave, where the sulphurous exhalations were so strong as to kill those who came nearest. Then, as a punishment for pursuing the sacred animals, a pestilence broke out, which, as an oracle told them, could only be checked by the people themselves becoming wolves (Serv. Mn. xi. 785). From this they were called Hirpini (from hirpus, a wolf), just as the Hirpinian Samnites had received their name from following the guidance of a wolf when they went off to find a new home. The wolf ceremony was, like the Roman Lupercalia (also from lupus, a wolf), a purifying one ; they ran naked and unhurt through blazing fire at their annual festival. This rite is de scribed by Strabo (V. 226) as occurring at the grove of Fero nia, at the foot of the mountain, and there was undoubtedly a close connection in this place between the two divinities. But Soranus was merely a local deity, the god of the mountain Soracte, while Feronia was one of the most widely reverenced goddesses, whose worship is traced in many parts of Italy, from Verona in the North to Latium in the South, and the Vestinians in the East. She seems to have been a goddess of nature, like Flora, but in some way came to be especially con nected with popular traffic. Her three principal groves ? at Soracte, at Anxur or Tarracina (ora manusque tua lavimus, Feronia, lympha, Hor. Sat. I. 5, 24), and at Trebula Mutu esca ? were all famous for the throng of traffickers from all vol. cxiii. ? no. 232. 4</page><page sequence="21">50 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, parts who gathered there; they were genuine fairs, where ped lers and showmen resorted as they do nowadays to cattle shows and camp-meetings. It was a disturbance at one of these fairs that led to the war of Tullus Hostilius with the Sabines (Liv. I. 30). It would be interesting to describe some others of the primi tive rites of the Romans, connected with their original charac ter as a farming and pasturing people ; such as the worship of Dea Dia in May by the Arval Brothers, one of the oldest and most illustrious of the patrician sodalities, and which was kept up long into the Empire. Many inscriptions, illustrating their usages, have been discovered at their sanctuary, five miles from the city, where they still continue to be found from time to time. Then there was the procession to the grove of Rubigo (rust) in April, at which the Flamen of Quirinus offered the prayer recorded by Ovid (Fast. IV. 911), "Harsh Rubigo, spare the growth of Ceres, and let the smooth top tremble above the ground. Let the crops, nourished by the favoring heavens, grow until they are ready for the sickle." The wor ship of the Lares and Manes, too, would throw much light upon the religious notions of the people; the genius, or indwelling spirit of the man, took its place after death among the Manes; the deified ancestors were Lares, while the spirits of the im pious flitted from place to place, tormenting the wicked, and themselves finding no rest; these were Larva? and Lemures. The word Lares came to have a rather wide compass; and we find that Alexander Severus had images in his chapel, (lararium) of Abraham, Christ, Apollonius of Tyana, Orpheus and others, besides his ancestors. (JE1. Lamp. Alex. Sev. 29.) But we must hasten on to the later developments of the Roman faith. The first great change wrought by foreign influence was in the direction of the Greek, partly in introducing new deities, partly in modifying the conceptions of the old. It was really a revolution to invest Jupiter, Mars, Minerva, and Neptune with the attributes of Zeus, Ares, Athene, and Poseidon, and to foist the whole Greek mythology, with its ideality and sen suousness, upon the dry, earnest, pure theology of the Romans. Cicero and Cato did not believe that their gods had ever done</page><page sequence="22">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 51 the acts that were ascribed to them ; in the time of Camillus nobody could have believed it, because these were so wholly at variance with the national mode of thought. The influence that came from the later intercourse with Greece was not a legitimate and salutary one. It was not Sophocles or Socra tes, not even Homer or Praxiteles, that introduced Grecian thought to the Romans ; it was the dregs of philosophy, ? not divine philosophy, ? the fancies and sensualities of rirt, when its spirit had disappeared, ? not the imaginative reason,? that came in to help corrupt a people that was going to ruin fast enough by itself. This, however, belongs to a later stage of Greek influence. The early Greek influence was good, or at all events not bad. For some three hundred years we watch a succession of new gods and goddesses borrowed from Greece. In some cases they were plainly foreign deities, and the name as well as the religion is new. In others some Roman divinity was found, often of wholly subordinate rank, and raised at once to impor tance and dignity by being clothed with all, the attributes and associations of some one of the twelve great gods of Greece. To the first class belong Apollo, Hercules, Castor and Pollux, and iEsculapius; these are in every respect foreign, although Apollo was identified with Soranus, and Hercules's shoulders were made to bear all the heroic traditions that had sprung up on Italian soil. There are as many of the second class. Diana has already been spoken of, and her resemblance to Artemis is enough to explain the identification of the two, especially in the fact that the Latin nymphs, the Virae, were peculiarly connected with her. Mercury again, originally hardly more than an indigitamentum, or impersonation of the act of traffic, became Hermes, the messenger of the gods, the contriver, the god of eloquence, the conductor of the souls of the dead, merely by virtue of the one function that the two had in common. Venus, the abstraction of sensuous pleasure, and at the same time (in these simple rural days) a goddess of the garden, in the same way became Aphrodite. Still more important is the case of Ceres. She has been shown to have been one of the original nature-deities of the Romans, but her worship was simple and public. Whatever</page><page sequence="23">52 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, sentiments of mystery were connected with the observation of nature were embodied in the worship of Bona Dea and per haps Dea Dia and Dis pater (the god of the lower world). It was to one of these, then, that the Greek mysteries of Demeter, Dionysos, and Kore should have been attached. Instead of that, Ceres was taken, joined with Liber and Libera (an utterly incongruous combination), and made the centre of a new wor ship, purely Greek, and conducted by Grecian priests, while at the same time the old festival of Ceres was kept up by the side of the new. The original Latin Ceres was now wholly overshadowed and obscured by her new functions as Demeter ; so that she appears from this time on as an essentially Greek divinity. The name of Proserpine, the goddess of the Indigita menta, who causes the young plant to creep forth from the ground, has so close a resemblance to Persephone, the daughter of Demeter, that she too was made into a Grecian goddess, and joined with Pluto as queen of the lower world. It is Marquardt's view that all these elements of Greek re ligion were introduced by method, and as part of a system, of which the Sibylline books were the authority, the Quindecim viri sacris faciundis the managers; that is, that the purchase of the Sibylline books marks distinctly a new era in the Roman religion, and that the two systems went on side by side, ? the Pontifices at the head of the native system, the Quindecimviri of the foreign. It is certain that the Sibylline books were of Greek origin, and that in most cases of the introduction of Greek rites it is explicitly stated that it was done by the direc tion of these books. One feature of the new system was the lectisternia, or festivals at which the statues of the gods were placed on couches at tables spread with a banquet. The Greek forms of worship mentioned above were all estab lished at Rome before the Second Punic War. Although they were essentially foreign, and in some cases in the hands of foreign priests, yet there was nothing in them (apart from the myths) really inconsistent with Roman ideas, and they were kept well in control by the authorities of the state. With the Second Punic War, when that baleful Greek influence de scribed above began to be powerfully felt, commences a new series of foreign rites of a new character, attended by the most</page><page sequence="24">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 53 disastrous consequences. In the case of Apollo, Diana, Ceres, ^Esculapius, and even Venus, there had been new ceremonies and at worst mysteries ; with the arrival of Cybele, the Great Mother, begins a period of orgies and debasing superstitions. The circumstances attending the introduction of this worship are too well known to need repetition ; but it cannot be made too plain, what a contrast this frenzied Oriental worship, with its bloody symbolism, its begging priests, its wild dances, and its trumpets and cymbals, made to the old Roman and even the earlier Greek rites. We can well understand how sus piciously these narrow-minded but clear-sighted senators must have stood aloof from it. But this was only a beginning. Soon after followed the rites of Bacchus, private in origin and cele bration, even more wild, orgiastic, and indecent. The Senate did its best to check the growth of these practices, but it was too late. Already the simple, pure, formal, strictly national religion of Rome was dead, and there was nothing for it but superstitions and philosophies. In saying that the Roman religion gave way to superstition and philosophy, it must be remarked that this was a natural transformation, and in certain aspects a salutary one. The nature-religion of the Greeks and Romans was in its essence capable of only a very limited development; that of the Romans was peculiarly narrow and inelastic. It was essentially a state religion, well adapted, in its formality and strictness, to a peo ple whose whole individuality was merged in that of the state. And whatever elements of worship were popular and spon taneous in their origin and character were pure outgrowths of that simple, unimaginative observation of nature and deification of its powers, which were natural to the Italian people. As the character of the nation developed, its religion was trans formed by successive stages. The first of these has already been traced. It is connected with the sway of the Tarquinian dynasty, when Rome first became conscious of her destiny, and from being a single Latin city assumed the dignity of a state. This individual member of the Latin confederacy is now found not merely in possession of the hegemony in Latium, but in a relation of equal alliance on the one side with this confederacy on the other. At this same time the political institutions</page><page sequence="25">54 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, expanded, and the patriarchal patrician organization began to be superseded by the principle of territorial nationality. With this political revolution there was naturally connected a relig ious one, which has been already described as consisting in the establishment of the supreme Capitoline triad, and in the in troduction of Greek rites and forms of faith, through the Sibylline books. Now these changes, it must be remembered, were not at all hostile to Roman nationality. They were, in truth, an expansion of it. The purity of the nationality was no ways impaired, but went on manifesting itself with more and more vigor for centuries. Whatever the Romans borrowed at this time either remained completely exotic, under the charge of Greek priests, or was completely assimilated, so as to be come an integral part of the Roman faith. With the Punic Wars comes in a new stage of growth, when the Roman people ceased to be purely Roman and became cos mopolitan. The change was one in capacity as well as in modes of thought. The early Roman had no needs or aspira tions which his native religion could not satisfy. His calm, rigid spirit was not disturbed by doubts and anxieties as to the future, or tormented by the perplexing problems of older states of society, or attracted by the enthusiasms and orgiastic rites of more excitable peoples. With the conquest of the world all this was changed. It was partly that new elements of popula tion flowed from all quarters into the capital of the world, partly that the Romans themselves had a wider field of view opened before them, and were more powerfully influenced by the thoughts and usages with which they were brought in con tact. With their old narrowness and formalism they lost, it is true, their old simplicity and purity, but they gained in insight and impressibility. Matthew Arnold speaks of the pagans of this time as " people who seem never made to be serious, never made to be sick or sorry." But this view is one-sided. They were sick and sorry, they did feel those longings and aspira tions which are so characteristic of modern times ; and these puerile, fanatical, and often disgusting superstitions, which mark the downfall of the ancient faith, are only the indications of a demand for, and a seeking after, something higher and better.</page><page sequence="26">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 55 The old Roman religion could not satisfy the new needs and longings of this new Roman people, because it had neither elasticity nor sympathetic power. It fell short as well of the intellectual demands of the time. It was abandoned, there fore, both by the masses, who were ready to believe, but needed some more vital faith, and by the cultivated, who had ceased to believe. The one class had recourse to superstitions, the other to philosophies. Three schools of philosophy gained a strong foothold among the cultivated classes of Romans, ? the Epicurean, with those who rejected all intervention of the gods in human affairs, the Stoic, with the more earnest and devout believers in a divine providence ; while the Academic school afforded intellectual discipline and interest to those who thought the whole subject beyond the scope of our intelligence. With the Epicureans associated itself all that was contaminat ing and destructive to morals and society; the Stoics quickly identified themselves with whatever survived that was noble and heroic, and we owe to them some of the most striking ex amples of devoted patriotism and disinterested virtue that his tory contains. To this period belongs Euhemerism, that school of philosophizing which considered the gods to be nothing but deified men. With all this the established religion fell into neglect. It is true that much of it preserved a certain popularity and respect by becoming identified with Greek fable. The Greek mythology satisfied some of the new longings of the community, ? those which were repelled by the formality and sterility of the old wor ship ; and some of the Roman gods, invested with new attributes, and made the heroes of adventures and exploits that their early worshippers never dreamed of, were still the objects of reverence. But whatever was distinctly Roman rapidly disap peared, with the exception of rites which, like the Lupercalia and the festival of Bona Dea, were in a degree fitted to satisfy the new needs. Names of gods were forgotten, temples fell into decay; consecrated places were filled with rubbish and filth, the most honored priesthoods were left vacant, holy times were neglected, and sacred observances were despised. Even Cato the Censor wondered that one haruspex could look another in the face without laughing; but this belonged to the</page><page sequence="27">56 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, age, not to Rome alone ; for Hannibal indignantly asked King Prusias, when he refused to fight, because the sacrifices were not favorable, whether he would rather put trust in a bit of real than in an experienced commander. Caesar indeed does not appear once in his whole career to have consulted the sacrifices. With the Empire came in a temporary reaction. Augustus, conservative in all things, was especially so in religion, and from him dates a restoration of the old temples and a more zealous observance of the old rites. So far as the state waa concerned, the decay of the Roman faith was arrested. At the same time the new regime was inaugurated by new observances, significantly connected with the Empire and the Julian dynasty. Sacrifices were offered thrice in the year to Peace, temples erected to Mars Ultor (the avenger of Julius), and Venus Genitrix (the mother of the race) ; and Augustus even aimed to make Apollo, rather than Mars, the special deity of his city. Meantime, while the old religion was neglected, and the higher classes were sedulously cultivating philosophy, the masses had taken refuge in Oriental superstitions. As the earlier epoch, that of the Tarquins, had received its character from Greece, this later one was influenced by Asia, ? the early source of religious inspiration to the Greeks, as well as the cradle of the later Christianity. It is not necessary wholly to despise the frantic rites of Cybele, or even those of Bacchus. They were perverted, as emotional religious observances are always in danger of being, ? as were those of Bona Dea her self, ? to an instrument of corruption and licentiousness. But unquestionably at their introduction they did satisfy a human want for which the hereditary religion made no provision. If Catholicism finds its purest expression in the ecstasies of St. Francis, if the most successful Protestant denominations stimulate the wild excitements of revivals and camp-meetings, we need not criticise the ancients too severely that they fed their religious cravings with fanaticisms, many of which dif fered from those of modern times rather in the object of the worship than in the forms and spirit. It was the best they could do. I am not concerned here to speak of the abomina tions to which they led, ? no more revolting than were attrib</page><page sequence="28">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 57 uted to the religious organization of the Knights Templars, or than are known of the Anabaptists of Munster. I care rather for what is true in these superstitions than for what is false. In a religious aspect we are already at the transition period which divides the ancient pagan world from the modern Chris tian world. The Greek and the Roman religion had each run its course, and Asia was now called in to contribute the vital element which they lacked. The worship of Cybele, of Isis and Sarapis, and of Mithras, attempted to give to humanity, although in an ignoble and distorted form, precisely those truths which Christianity brought home to the heart of men, ? immortality, and the unity of the godhead. And if Chris tendom borrowed some of her most sacred institutions from the earliest Roman forms, if the Roman Catholic ritual and ceremonial are in many respects only the ancient Roman ones over again, and the festivals of the Church have many of them come straight down from republican times, yet these are but matters of form. In more essential spiritual points we find a frequent parallelism between the accepted doctrines of Chris tianity and that mixture of Roman and Oriental religion which had sway in the later Republic and the early Empire. In the article upon the religion of the Greeks, already re ferred to, I pointed out the connection of the myths of Per sephone, Adonis, and Osiris with the death of the year, and its revivification in spring, and showed how these myths became the symbol and expression of the idea of immortality. The Romans had hardly anything in their primitive religion which could be made use of for this purpose; or, rather, it would be more correct to say, they did not possess the creative imagina tion which would develop their simple ideas into a sympathetic faith. Even when they introduced from Greece the combined worship of Ceres, Liber, and Libera, and the Eleusinian mys teries along with it, it was left wholly to Greek priests, and would appear to have soon become wholly formal and lifeless. The worship of Cybele, introduced at the time of the Second Punic War, assumed a more popular and enthusiastic character, although even this failed to be fully developed until the time of the Empire, when the rites of the " Great Mother " became still more orgiastic, and were made the expression of a lively</page><page sequence="29">58 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, religious enthusiasm. In its essential features the new March festival of the Great Mother bore many resemblances to Easter. It was at just the same time of the year, when the day at last gets victory over the night, and the new spring rises to life from its long sleep. The festival lasted several days, chief among them being one of mourning and fasting, to which fol lowed, on the 25th of March, a day of joy, when the dead Attis was raised to life from the grave. The same idea was expressed in the Egyptian religion of Isis, which was one of the most popular in Rome at the time of the Christian era. The death of Osiris at the hands of his enemy Typhon was like the abduction of Persephone by the god of the lower world ; the sad search by Isis for her lost husband was that of Demeter for her daughter ; and when the lost one was found at last, the worshippers broke out in shouts of joy, " We have found him ; we rejoice with thee ! " In this Egyptian myth, as transformed by the Alexandrian Greeks, Osiris became Sarapis, who lived on as king of the lower world, ? a somewhat different phase of the belief in immortality from that which is seen in the worship of Cybele. In the worship of Isis we mark for the first time a tendency to give personality and a name to that supreme deity, 6 Tov o\ov Kovpov cwrar tcop, whom so many philosophers and thinkers had already recognized. " Thou, goddess Isis, who alone art all things," says an inscription ; and her enthusiastic votaries claimed for this goddess that she was in truth the supreme divinity. We must not make the mistake, however, of recognizing in a supreme divinity suoh as this the strict idea of one God, like the Jewish Jehovah. Polytheism does not differ from mono theism in the accident of number alone, but in the very con ception of the divine nature. By deus the Romans meant only a supernatural being, who could help or harm men, and who might be an object of reverence ; what we understand by a spirit. Thus the spirits of the departed were dii manes ; that is, when the genius, or indwelling spirit of a man, passed from his body, it became a god. Primarily there is no necessary inequality among these spirits, only a difference of function ; and it was the greater or less importance and extent of these functions, or the accident of local worship, that gave one god</page><page sequence="30">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 59 a higher position in rank and power than another. Thus Jupi ter, the god of the sky, whose powers had so wide a sway, and whose sphere embraced that of all others, naturally became the chief god, both with Greeks and Romans; while Mars, from the accident of his being the special god of the Italian race, held a much higher position than his Greek counterpart Ares. But Jupiter was only the strongest of the gods ; he was not God, in the monotheistic view. When the Greek and Roman philosophers spoke of a divine power which was really supreme in the universe, they rarely called it Zeus or Jupiter, but Fate, or Necessity, or simply God. On the other hand, Monotheism is not at all incompatible with a multitude of divine beings, such as the Romans would have called del. The Jews had their angels, the Catholic Church has its saints, even Protestants hold fast to the exist ence of angels, devils, ghosts, and witches. " The difference between monotheism and polytheism," says Hartung, " lies noways in the number of supernatural beings, but in the re lation of this plurality to the unity; .... in the former necessity has given way to freedom, in the latter freedom is confined under necessity " ; that is, " the heathen gods have necessity over them, not in them; under it they act after their wills, endowed with like conditions but higher powers than men," so that Jupiter was only the first among equals. The symbolism of the myth of Isis and Osiris ? the same as that of Demeter and Persephone, Cybele and Attis, Aphro dite and Adonis ? is the deepest and tenderest in the whole range of mythology; and the truth of immortality expressed in it is one of the dearest to the human heart. Probably there was something in the Egyptian costume and ritual that took a peculiar hold of whatever was sensitive in the Roman people, and at any rate this worship seemed to them to embody all the results of the centuries of Egyptian wisdom and learning. However that may be, it was the popular religion in the early Empire, and Isis and her husband ? under his new name Sarapis ? not unnaturally gathered about them most of the enthusiastic and sympathetic elements of faith. With him were identified all the highest attributes of deity, with her all the womanly qualities, like the Virgin Mary in the Catholic sys</page><page sequence="31">60 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, tern; their devotees went so far as to claim that all the chief gods and goddesses of various nations ? those who might themselves have been called the sole God ? were only these under other names and in a different form. This was not pure monotheism, but rather an effort to raise one out of the pan theon to a higher rank than the rest, by removing his rivals. On the other hand, it was a step towards monotheism, and satisfied the monotheistic cravings, so far as they consciously existed at that time. It has been already said that this was a transitional period, when beliefs were being transformed, and rites from all parts of the earth were brought together and compared. In consistency with this, the conception of a chief god was no longer the polytheistic one; at the same time it was not yet clearly monotheistic. The dynasty of the Severi, which formed so important an epoch in the political development of the Empire, was an almost equally important one in religious matters. It marks a new irruption of Asiatic superstitions, chiefly embodied in the wor ship of the Sun, under his Syrian name Elagabalus and the Persian name Mithras. With the Unconquerable Sun, Sol Invictus, was associated a still higher form of the growing monotheistic conception than that of Isis and Sarapis. The worship of Mithras, with its strange and bloody symbolism, and its claims to represent the unity of the godhead, was zealously prosecuted even after Christianity had become the state religion. Heathenism, in its expiring form, assumed all the attributes and claims of the victorious faith which it could, and thus for a while held its ground against it. To this period belong especially the fastings, expiations, and cleansing rites which form a link between the pagan religion and mediaeval Christianity. The most striking of them was the Taurobolion, or baptism in the blood of a bull (other animals were also used), which was connected especially with the March festival of the Magna Mater. It was a striking illustration, however, of the growing unity of faith, that this ceremony was not peculiar to any one worship, but was associated with all the forms of orgiastic religion of the time. Lastly, a word must be said upon the worship of the Em peror. This has been a strange puzzle to many moderns, but</page><page sequence="32">1871.] The Religion of the Ancient Romans. 61 was in reality not merely a direct outgrowth of the ancient re ligious conceptions, but a very striking and immediate link between them and those of the modern world. It was not the man Augustus or Trajan that was worshipped, but the divine spirit, the genius, which dwelt in them and inspired the great actions of their life. If this genius became a god at the death of the poorest and meanest, and was added to the dii manes, how much more in the case of great and beneficent sovereigns ? The apotheosis of an emperor after his death, even the wor ship of his genius during his life, was neither irrational nor illogical, when once we understand the ancient conception of the divine nature. That the same honors were bestowed upon a Nero and Caracalla may have been fear or flattery; it was, at any rate, an outgrowth of the same mode of thought. But we need not go to the ancients for an analogy. The modern world is perfectly familiar with the spectacle of a man of ordinary powers and passions invested, by the election of a body of men, with a peculiar holiness and sanctity, so that it is con ceived that when he speaks it is God that speaks through him. No one believes that it is in the man Gregory or Leo that this divinity consists, but that in some way a divine nature has been added to his human nature, by a direct and special act of the Almighty. Now the Pope is as much a god, in the eyes of his followers, as a Roman Emperor ever was ; that is, not at all, according to the modern definition of the word god. The appointment to the imperial dignity was, on the average, hardly more irregular, in respect to fraud, violence, and corruption, than that to the Papacy during a great part of its history ; and any one who believes that John XII. and Alexander VI. were clothed with these holy attributes and powers, by virtue of the post they held as Christ's vicegerent on earth, need not find any difficulty in seeing how the Roman people could believe that Caligula and Commodus were invested with a similar sanctity by virtue of holding a post which in that time and for that people was the highest and most important that could be conceived of. My aim in this paper has been, first, to point out the essen tial and distinctive features of the primitive religion of the Romans, and to show how important its study is in the com</page><page sequence="33">62 The Religion of the Ancient Romans. [July, parative view of religions; secondly, to show that its over throw in the later Republic was a necessary development, and that the superstitions which took its place were not merely the best and only substitute they had, but did actually satisfy some of the most earnest cravings of the human heart. The cor ruptions they underwent were quite as much the result as the cause of the corruptions of society. Of the works whose titles are placed at the head of the arti cle, that of Preller is, on the whole, the most complete and satis factory for the use of the student. Hartung is a writer of more originality, and far more suggestive and instructive for the philosophy of the subject. Zumpt's little treatise contains some excellent points, but it was a popular address, and makes no pretensions to fulness. Marquardt's work is admirably clear and copious in citation, like all his writings ; but it is partial, being purely the antiquities of worship, rather than the religious system as such. Preller's treatise, being later than Hartung's and more extensive, contains material which Hartung has passed over; so that, while quite inferior in in sight and suggestiveness, it is superior in arrangement and completeness.
