<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLERIDGE'S "A LIGHT IN SOUND": SCIENCE, METASCIENCE, AND POETIC IMAGINATION MEYER HOWARD ABRAMS Frederic J. Whiton Professor of English, Cornell University (Read Appril 21, 1972, in the Symposium on Wordsworth, Scott, and Coleridge) IN THE PRINTED COPY of "The Eolian Harp" of 1797, Coleridge penciled in the margin, "This I think the most perfect poem I ever wrote"; with characteristic self-deprecation he added, "Bad may be the best perhaps." 1 Coleridge's first sen- tence is justified by the crucial part played by the poem not only in his own poetic development, but as the first and paradigmatic instance of the central romantic form I have elsewhere called "the greater romantic lyric" of description and medi- tation. In the mid-1790's Coleridge's ambitious longer poems were in the genre he called "the sublimer Ode," in which he imitated the oracular manner and visionary matter of an earlier era when, as he said, "the Bard and the Prophet were one and the same character." 2 Writing amid the hopes and terrors engendered by the turbulent early years of the French Revolution, he had tried- emulating Milton in an earlier period of revolu- tionary crisis-to endow his poems with a reso- nant and authoritative public voice, like that of the Biblical prophets, as the sanction for a philo- sophical, theological, and moral frame of reference that would help his contemporaries keep their bearings in a time of dereliction and dismay. These poems included passages of eloquence, but they manifested a borrowed and unconvincing stance, ill-digested Miltonisms, and a shrill fal- setto voice; as Coleridge himself commented, in the effort to dramatize and give "a poetic colour- ing to abstract and metaphysical truths," his poetry "is crowded and sweats beneath a heavy burthen of Ideas and Imagery! It has seldom Ease." 3 1 Cited by James Dykes Campbell, ed., The Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (London, 1893), p. 578. 2Dedication to "Ode on the Departing Year" (1796), in Ernest Hartley Coleridge, ed., The Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (2 v., Oxford, 1912) 2: p. 1114. 3 Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, ed. J. Shawcross (2 v., Oxford, 1907) 1, 3; Collected Letters of Samuel In "The Eolianl Harp" Coleridge established the presence of a private person in a localized setting, speaking with a conversational voice in a fluent blank verse that conceals the intricacy of the struc- ture, in which the counter-movements of descrip- tion and meditation form a double helix. The poem begins with a description of observed details of the outer scene, then turns inward to the play of the observing consciousness; at the same time the consciousness, freed from time and space, moves out through a sustained evolution of mem- ory, thought, and anticipation, which is controlled throughout by the seemingly casually chosen par- ticulars of the physical setting, rises to a climactic moment of vision beyond sense, then turns again outward and also rounds back to end where it had begun, with a recapitulation of the details of the outer scene. "The Eolian Harp" is a flawed instance of this remarkable poetic invention; there are instances of stock diction and standard moral parallels ("Meet emblems they of Innocence and Love!" "such should Wisdom be"), and the con- cluding verse-paragraph strikes the modern reader as a timid and ineptly managed retreat to religious orthodoxy from the bold speculation of the middle of the poem. Within a few years, however, Cole- ridge eliminated such weaknesses to achieve a perfection of the circuitous lyric of description and meditation in "Frost at Midnight" (1798). The standard text of "The Eolian Harp" (re- produced at the end of this essay) is usually dated 1795, but is in fact the version that Coleridge published in his collected poems, Sybelline Leaves, in 1817. Between 1795 and 1817 the poem was frequently altered and supplemented so that, al- though it was the first of his conversation poems to be undertaken, it was the last to be completed. The final version is thus a palimpsest that can serve as an index to Coleridge's evolving thought and imagination over a period of twenty-two years -the crucial years between his early and his Taylor Coleridge, ed.

I shall sketch the four chief stages of the poem's development; ref- erences are to the line-numbers in the standard text. (1) The first stage was a manuscript draft of seventeen lines entitled "Effusion 35. Clevedon, August 20th, 1795." It corresponds, though with differences of detail, to the first sixteen and one-half lines of the final version. "Effusion" connoted a spontaneous expression of personal circumstances and feelings. On August 20 Cole- ridge was engaged to marry Sara Fricker, and the poem represents the lovers on a visit to the cottage in Somersetshire that they were about to rent as their first home. The poet is seated by the cottage at evening, his bride leaning against his arm, receptive to the light and scents and sounds of the peaceful scene. In the partly opened window they place that favorite romantic musical instrument, a wind harp-that is, an oblong sounding box whose strings, in response to the variable touch of the breeze, vibrate into chords of altering pitch and loudness. The lover's consciousness invests the relations of the casement and the harp, the harp and the circumambient breeze, with the posture, languor, and guile of the erotic dalliance between the human couple. In the final rendering of these lines: And that simplest Lute, Placed length-ways in the clasping casement, hark! How by the desultory breeze caress'd Like some coy maid half yielding to her lover, It pours such sweet upbraiding, as must needs Tempt to repeat the wrong! (2) The second chief stage was the first pub- lished version in Coleridge's Poemrs on Various Subjects of 1796. Although still called an "Ef- fusion," the poem has been developed into an obviously artful construction of fifty-six lines; it corresponds to all of the final text except that it lacks the passage, lines 26-33. This version is the one that justifies the usual description of "The Eolian Harp" as a wedding or honeymoon poem: Coleridge and Sara, having been married on Oc- tober 4, 1795, are now living in the cottage at Clevedon.5 Taking up where the earlier manu- 4This poem is printed from the manuscript at Rugby School in The Poetical Works, ed. E. H. Coleridge, 2: p. 1021. The editor also prints a transcript of a MS draft of "The Eolian Harp" written in 1797 (2: pp. 1021-1023). 5 This poem was written in the period of love and happiness between Coleridge's at first reluctant courtship script left off, Coleridge first continues the earlier sexual imagery (the sounds, at the bolder impor- tunities of the masculine wind, "Over delicious surges sink and rise"), then introduces a descrip- tive tour-de-force wherein the witchery of nature's music transforms, to the musing mind, the sights and odors and sounds of this world into a fantasy of "Fairy-Land" or (the subsequent imagery sug- gests) of an exotic paradise, Where Melodies round honey-dropping flowers, Footless and wild, like birds of Paradise, Nor pause, nor perch, hovering on untam'd wing! The poet's meditation now shifts (line 34) to recall recurrent occasions in which-not at eve- ning and in the company of the beloved, but alone and while resting from his work at high noon- he lies stretched out on a nearby hillside, watching the dance of sunlight on the sea. In this remem- bered situation the presently perceived wind-harp remains the vehicle of the metaphoric process of thought, but the poet, when musing in solitude, is preoccupied not with love but with metaphysics. First the sounds of the harp (lines 39-43) become the analogue for the fantasies that, random and various as the breeze, "Traverse my indolent and passive brain." Then, in a sudden focus of the random thoughts, the harp modulates into a radi- cal image for the consciousness of all living things, responding with the music of thought to one divine and all-informing breeze: And what if all of animated nature Be but organic Harps diversely fram'd That tremble into thought, as o'er them sweeps Plastic and vast, one intellectual breeze, At once the Soul of each, and God of all ? The term "plastic" for a formative and organiz- ing principle within nature-derived from Ralph Cudworth and other seventeenth-century Neo- platonists-was widely used in the 1790's, and Coleridge suggested in several other poems written at the time of "The Eolian Harp" that there is in nature an indwelling cause of the organization and his stormy family life. As he wrote to his close friend Thomas Poole on October 7, 1795, in a passage closely related to details of the poem: "On Sunday morning I was married . . . united to the woman, whom I love best of all created Beings.-We are settled-nay-quite domesticated at Clevedon-Our com- fortable Cot!-! . . . The prospect around us is perhaps more various than any in the kingdom-Mine Eye glut- tonizes.-The Sea-the distant Islands !-the opposite Coasts !-I shall assuredly write Rhymes-let the nine Muses prevent it, if they can-."

SOC. and consciousness of all individual existents.6 But he always expressed this concept in a guarded way, and in "The Eolian Harp" he presents it in the mode of a hypothetical question. Even in this form it turns out to be too bold, for even more than in his contemporary poems, it opens up a possibility that filled Coleridge with metaphysical terror: the world-view he called "Pantheism." That is, the passage threatens to absorb a trans- cendent and personal Creator of the world, with- out remainder, into an indwelling Soul of Nature, the Pneuma or Spiritus Sacer or Anitma Mundi of the Stoics and Neoplatonists, which informs all the material universe and constitutes all modes of consciousness. Furthermore, as in the pagan phi- losophers who had taken the terms pneumc, spiri- tus, and anima in the literal sense of breeze or breath, Coleridge's "intellectual breeze" even sug- gests a regressive form of the religion of Nature in which the unifying presence is a sacred wind or divine breath.7 The poet therefore represents his hypothetical speculation as having been spoken aloud, so that Sara-the voice of domestic Chris- tian piety, a dramatized aspect of Coleridge's own divided mind-may dispraise such philosophy as "shapings of the unregenerate mind." The lyric speaker precipitately retracts the analogy and in- stead acknowledges his faith in a Christian Deity capable of yielding, to a sinful and miserable man, a grace beyond his deserts. The listing of these gifts in the concluding line closes the circle of the poem by repeating, in reverse order, the de- scriptive details of the beginning: "Peace, and this Cot, and thee, heart-honour'd Maid"-ending thus with the "pensive Sara" addressed in the opening phrase. (3) Except that it dropped "Effusion" from the title, Coleridge's Poems of 1797 reproduced the version published in 1796. Coleridge introduced the third major change six years later, in his Poems of 1803. Here he deleted lines 21-25-the comparison of the music of the wind harp to the 6 H. W.

In the original version of this inserted passage: Methinks it should have been impossible Not to love all things in a World like this, Where e'en the Breezes of the simple Air Possess the power and Spirit of Melody! (4) The fourth important change completes the poem as we have it now. In his collected poetry of 1817, Sybelline Leaves, Coleridge for the first time entitled the poem "The Eolian Harp." He restored the lines on fairy-land and the birds of paradise which he had dropped from the preceding edition, letting them stand between the passage on human love and that on the love for all things. Then, after he had finished correcting the proofs for Sybelline Leaves, Coleridge sent the printer a list of Errata in which he included, for insertion immediately after the lines on the birds of para- dise, a new quatrain, together with a version of the succeeding passage on the love for all things which he had revised so as to accord with these four niew lines. The total insertion, which I reproduce as it was printed in the Errata, consti- tutes lines 26-33 of the final text: 0! the one Life, within us and abroad, Which meets all Motion and becomes its soul, A Light in Sound, a sound-like power in Light, Rhythm in all Thought, and Joyance every where- Methinks, it should have been impossible Not to love all things in a world so fill'd, Where the breeze warbles and the mute still Air Is Music slumbering on its instrument! "O! the one Life. . . ." The exclamation in- troduces a moment of vision that every reader feels to be the imaginative climax of the poem. These lines, however, in T. S. Eliot's phrase, communicate before they are understood. In the confidence that they will communicate more sub- tly and richly after they are understood-and also that to understand them is to understand what is most distinctive in Coleridge's mature thought and imagination-I shall undertake to explicate the passage by seeking answers to four questions: 8 Coleridge had made an unsuccessful attempt to get his printer to delete the passage on fairy-land and the birds of paradise from the preceding version in the Poems of 1797; see George Whalley, "Coleridge and Southey in Bristol, 1795," Review of English Studies, new ser., 1 (1950): p. 332n.</page><page sequence="4">VOL. 116, NO. 6, 1972] COLERIDGE'S "A LIGHT IN SOUND" 461 What did Coleridge mean by his allusion to "A light in sound, a sound-like power in light"? How is this allusion related to "the one Life within us and abroad / Which meets all motion"? In what way does the insight into a light in sound justify the sense of "Joyance every where"? And what has this entire complex of a light in sound, the one Life, and universal joyance to do with the relation between the human lovers that precedes it and the culminating love for all things that follows it? Exploration of the conceptual scheme that un- derlies this passage involves Coleridge's views about Newton's Opticks, Newton's scientific meth- ods and theories, and the post-Newtonian world picture; the new metaphysical system that Cole- ridge constructed on the basis of his reading in Friedrich von Schelling and other German Natur- philosophen; concepts that he found in Jacob Boehme and other esoteric thinkers; as well as his interpretation of the Biblical accounts of the creation and the Incarnation; so that I must be -ery selective. But even a cursory survey of the cognitive infra-structure of the imaginative mo- ment expressed in these eight lines will indicate that they implicate a much heavier "burthen of ideas" than that under which his early bardic poems had sweated and strained. Coleridge la- mented repeatedly that metaphysics and "abstruse thought." to which he had turned for refuge from personal disasters, had depressed or destroyed his power of poetry. Uinwanted "metaphysical trains of thought," he wrote in a letter to Sotheby, when I wished to write a poem, beat up Game of far other kind-instead of a Covey of poetic Partridges with whirring wings of music . . . up came a meta- physical Bustard. urging it's slow, heavy, laborious, earth-skimming Flight, over dreary &amp; level Wastes. But less than a week earlier Coleridge had also insisted to the same correspondent that "a great Poet must be, implicite if not explicite a profound Metaphysician. He may not have it in logical coherence. . But he must have it by Tact. . ."9 It is because, in the passage of "Th-e Eolian Harp" which is our concern, the burthen of ideas remains largely implicit within the imagi- native insight it generated and supported that 9 Collected Letters, to William Sotheby, 19 July, 1802, 2: p. 814; 13 July, 1802, 2: p. 810. Coleridge wrote to Wordsworth on 3 July, 1803: You are "a great Poet by inspirations, &amp; in the Moments of revelation, but . . . a thinking feeling Philosopher habitually . . ." (ibid., p. 957). Coleridge is able to write philosophical poetry with the ease he had earlier sought and here supremely achieved. I. A LIGHT IN SOUND What are we to make of the mysterious refer- ence to "A light in sound, a sound-like power in light"? The figures, technically, are oxymorons, and have usually been interpreted as alluding to synesthesia-the phenomenon in which the stimu- lation of one sense evokes a response involving a different sense. There had during the preceding century been intense interest, among poets and critics as well as philosophers, in such intersen- sory phenomena, stimulated in part by Newton's analogies in his Opticks between the propagation of light and of sound and between the perception of harmony and discord in musical tones and in colors.10 Coleridge shared this interest in what he called in the Biographia Literaria "the vestigia communia of the senses, the latency of all in each, and more especially . . . the excitement of vision by sound," 11 and the line "a light in sound" may include the suggestion of such a vestigial common- sensorium as an instance of the universal "latency of all in each" that leads to the poet's invocation of the one Life. But Coleridge's orbit of refer- ence in this line is much wider than the psychol- ogy of sense-perception, for it involves a total metaphysic of the constitution of the material universe, of the nature of life. and of the relation of the mind to the universe it perceives. The quatrain of "The Eolian Harp" on a light in sound was added in a list of Errata to Sybel- line Leaves that Coleridge composed no earlier than the spring of 1816, and possibly as late as the spring of 1817.12 This places the writing of 10 Erika von Erhardt-Siebold, "Harmony of the Senses in English, German, and French Romanticism," Publ.

See also Coleridge's letter of 1801, in which he expressed his intention "to evolve all the five senses, that is, to deduce them from one sense . . ." (Collected Letters 2: p. 706). 12 On February 10, 1816, Coleridge returned to his pub- lisher, John Gutch of Bristol, the signatures of the proof- sheets of Sybelline Leaves that included "The Eolian Harp" (Collected Letters 4: p. 621, notes 2 and 3). On June 6, 1816, he wrote to Gutch that he will need to send him "a very long List" of Errata; and on June 14 he wrote a note to the printer, on the revised proof-sheets</page><page sequence="5">462 MEYER HOWARD ABRANIS [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. the quatrain squarely in the middle of the remark- able span of four years or so when, in a sudden burst of intellectual activity, Coleridge composed his most important works on philosophy and sci- ence, including the Biographia Literaria, the The- ory of Life, his two Lay Sermons, his radically revised and enlarged version of The Friend, and the series of Philosophical Lectures that he deliv- ered between December, 1818, and March, 1819.13 All these works contain passages relevant to Coleridge's theories of the relations between light, sound, and life, and I shall later cite some of them. Most immediately pertinent and revealing, however, are a series of philosophical letters that Coleridge wrote between November, 1816, and January, 1818 14-that is, during and soon after the time when he composed the Errata-which show that he was almost obsessively preoccupied with the ideas that underlie the passage added to "The Eolian Harp." Thus, Coleridge wrote to Ludwig Tieck on July 4, 1817, a few weeks before the Sybelline Leaves was issued, that the position taken by Newton in his Opticks that "a Rayi of Light" is a "Thing," "a physical synodir al Individuum," and that "the Prism is a mere mechanic Dissector" of "this complex yet divisible Ray," had always appeared to him "monstrous FICTIONS!" In- stead he put forward the view-adopted, he said, "probably from Behmen's Aurora, which I had conjured over at School"-"that Sound was of the final signature of Sybelline Lcaves, that "I shall send a List of the Errata" (ibid., p. 645 and note 2). Then, on May 22, 1817, he wrote in a letter to Thomas Curtis-the London printer for Gale and Fenner, to whom Coleridge had transferred the publishing of Sybelline Leaves and Biographia Literaria-that "the Day after tomorrow" he would visit him "&amp; bring with me all that remains for me to do with regard to the Literary Life &amp; the Sybelline Leaves-Errata &amp;c." (ibid., p. 734). Professor Earl Leslie Griggs has written to me that the Errata are printed on the type of paper used by the London rather than the Bristol printer. It is possible, then, that the Errata (including the additional passage for "The Eolian Harp") were not composed until May, 1817. I am indebted to Professor Griggs for private corre- spondence on this matter, as well as for the superb edi- torial work throughout his edition of Coleridge's Collected Letters. 13 See Griggs, ed., Collected Letters 5: "Introduction," p. lvi. Griggs's Index to the Letters makes it possible to determine the dates during which Coleridge was working on each of these items. 14To James Gillman, 10 Nov., 1816; to Ludwig Tieck, 4 July, 1817; to Lord Liverpool, 28 July, 1817; to C. A. Tulk, Sept., 1817, and, again, 12 Jan., 1818. Light under the praepotence of Gravitation, and Color= Gravitation under the praepotence of Light." 15 Above all, two letters that Coleridge wrote shortly thereafter to the Swedenborgian. C. A. Tulk, provide decisive clues not only to the line about light and sound but also (as we shall see) to the entire passage we are scrutinizing. In the first letter, written two months after the publication of Sybelline Leaves, Coleridge declared that "the two Poles of the material Universe are ...Light and Gravitation. . . . The Life of Na- ture consists in the tendency of the Poles to re-unite, and to find themselves in the re-union." Then: Color is Gravitation under the power of Light . . . while Sound on the other hand is Light under the power or paramountcy of Gravitation. Hence the analogies of Sound to Light. ...16 "A light in sound, a sound-like power in liglht" -we find in these letters references to the light, sound, and power alluded to in this line, and to the analogies that the line suggests between sound and light, as well as an indicated relation between these matters and life-"the Life of Nature." But what has all this to do with gravitation, the deficiencies of Newton's theory of light, and the polarity of the material universe, and what are we to make of "praepotence"? At first sight these passages, instead of explaining the mystery of a light in sound, seem to wrap it in an enigma. To explain in turn this enigma, we need to glance at some elements in the world-view that Coleridge was evolving in the period 1815-1818. Coleridge's reference of his views on light and sound to Boehme's Autrora, it will appear later, has substantial grounds, but it is misleading none- theless. Coleridge's immediate precedents for the particular terms and metaphysical constructions in these letters were the writings of the contempo- rary philosopher Friedrich Schelling and, to a lesser extent, the writings of Schelling's fellow- workers in Naturphilosophie, especially Heinrich Steffens.'7 He had begun to study Schellitig in- 15 Collected Letters 4: pp. 750-751. 16 To Tulk, Sept., 1817, ibid., pp. 771, 773. (Sybelline Leaves had been issued by 22 July, 1817; see ibid., p. 754, n. 1.) In the second letter to Tulk, 12 Jan., 1818, Coleridge said again: "Sound is to Light what Color is to Gravity-viz. Sound = Light under the predominance of Gravity: Color = Gravity under the predominance or, as it were, the Dynasty of Light" (ibid., p. 807). 17 For a balanced estimate of the complex relations of Coleridge's thought of this period both to Boehme and to Schelling, see Richard Haven, Patterns of Conscioutsness:</page><page sequence="6">VOL. 116, NO. 6, 1972] COLERIDGE'S "A LIGHT IN SOUND" 463 tensively at about 1808-his burst of philosophical activity in the 1810's is, in considerable part, a result of the exciting possibilities that Schelling's thought opened out to him. For the sake of brevity I shall attend mainly to Coleridge's own views, with only an occasional glance at the Ger- man formulations that he adopted but altered to accord with his prior interests and speculations. Our investigation leads us to the center of Cole- ridge's philosophy of nature. This is an area of his tlhought that, until very recently, scholars have either discreetly overlooked or else-assessing it as aln attempt to achieve by free fantasy what scientists discover by patient experiment-have rejected as "mere abracadabra," "a bizarre farrago of pretentious nonsense." 18 Such judgments are inievitable if we simply apply to Coleridge's scheme of nature the criteria of the philosophical positi- vism that Coleridge's scheme was specifically in- tended to dispossess. If our intent, on the other lhaind, is not to dismiss but to understand an im- portant development in nineteenth-century intel- lectual history, then we can do no better than to emulate Coleridge's own procedure, which John Stuart Mill found to be so intellectually liberating. Mill poiinted out that by Bentham (the great philosophical positivist of his time), men have been led to ask of an opinion, "Is it true?" By Coleridge, they have been led to ask "What is the meaning of it?" and to answer this question by tryinig to look at the opinion "from within." The long duration of a belief, [Coleridge] thought, is at least proof of an adaptation in it to some portion or other of the human mind; and if, on digging down to the root, we do not find, as is generally the case, some truth, we shall find some natural want or re- quirement of human nature which the doctrine in qtuestion is fitted to satisfy.19 Let us theni take Coleridge's vision of nature seriotislv and try to look at it from within, to A4nt Essay ot Coleridge (University of Massachusetts Press, 1969), pp. 89-96, 134-142. On the relations of Coleridge's philosophy to Schelling, the fullest treatment is by G. N. G.

Coleridge's aim was not to replace experimental science by speculative science, but instead to de- velop a counter-metaphysic to the metaphysical foundations of modern science; his philosophy of nature, in short, was not science, nor anti-science, but metascience. By the reference, in his letter to Tieck, to Newton's "monstrous fictions" in the Opticks, he did not mean to oppugn Newton as an experimental physicist, to whose procedures and discoveries he paid spacious tribute.20 His objec- tion was to Newton as a man whose prestige as a physicist had given impetus to a metaphysics that, in Coleridge's view, permeated and vitiated all areas of thought and culture in the eighteenth cen- tury, "the Epoch of the Understanding and the Senses" 21 in philosophy, psychology, politics, re- ligion, and the arts. For despite his reluctance to feign hypotheses, Newton had proposed, in the "Queries" he added to his Opticks, that rays of light are "corpuscular," that is, "very small Bodies emitted from shining Substances," and that these bodies in motion excite "Waves of Vibrations, or Tremors" in a hypothetical "aether." This aether, although very "rare and subtile" is nonetheless a material medium that pervades, in varying densi- ties, both space and bodies and serves to explain not only the action at a distance both of light and gravity, but also the refraction and reflection of light, as well as the propagation of light and sound from the eye and ear through the nerves "into the place of Sensation" where they are converted into sight and hearing.22 20 For Coleridge's lifelong interest in experimental sci- ence, together with a collection of his representative judgments on Newton-who as physicist was "the im- mortal Newton" whose "ethereal intuition" revealed "the constructive principle of the material universe"-see Roberta Florence Brinkley, ed., Coleridge on the Seven- teenth Century (Duke University Press, 1955), pp. 393- 408; also The Statesman's Manual, in Lay Sermons (London, 1852), pp. 57-58, 90. As early as 23 Mar., 1801, when he began to study Newton's Opticks, Coleridge wrote that he was "exceedingly delighted with the beauty &amp; neatness of his experiments, &amp; with the accuracy of his imumediate Deductions from them," but that his opinions and theories "founded on these Deductions" were so superficial as "to be deemed false" (Collected Letters 2: p. 709). 21Written by Coleridge on the flyleaf of a copy of The Friend (1818), ed.

This procedure, Coleridge argues, sets up a logical regress, since it undertakes to solve "Phae- nomena by Phaenomena that immediately become part of the Problem to be solved." 23 Worse still, Newton in his famed thirty-first Query had put forward the stark image of a universe whose ulti- mate elements are indivisible particles of matter capable of motion: It seems probable to me, that God in the Beginning form'd Matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, moveable Particles, of such Sizes and Figures, and with such other Properties, and in such Proportioni to Space, as most conduced to the End for which he form'd them. ...24 And as ultimate reality is thus reduced to masses and motion-for the simple reason that these are the only things that the highly specialized tech- niques of physical science are capable of managing mathematically-so the Creator of this reality is reconstrued to accord with such a postulated crea- tion. That is, Newton's God is represented as the omnipresent mover of all particles, and also as the infallible seer of the particles in themselves that we are able to see only after they have been translated into the "images" formed by the sense through the intermediation of rays of liglit. God, Newton says, is "a powerful ever-living Agent, who being in all Places, is . . . able by his Will to move the Bodies within his boundless uniform Sensorium"; he is also the Being who in infinite Space, as it were in his Sensory, sees the things themselves intimately . . . wholly by their immediate presence to himself: Of which things the Images only carried through the Organs of Sense into our little Sensoriums, are there seen and beheld by that which in us perceives and thinks.25 "Sir Isaac Newton's Deity," Coleridge drily re- marked, "seems to be alternately operose and indo- lent," for he undertakes to do everything, yet delegates so much power to "Vice-regent second causes" as "to make it inconceivable what he cal have reserved." 26 Newton's move, as Coleridge saw it, was an immense extrapolation of a working fiction of physical science-what we now call a "conceptual model"-into a picture of the actual constitution 23 To C.

The "Mechanic or Corpuscular Scheme," Coleridge said, "in order to submit the various phenomena of moving bodies to geometri- cal construction," had to abstract "from corporeal substance all its positive properties," leaving it only "figure and mobility. And as a fiction of scienice, it would be difficult to overvalue this invention." But Descartes and later thinkers "propounded it as truth of fact: and instead of a World created and filled with productive forces by the Almighty Fiat, left a lifeless Machine whirled about by the dust of its owni Grinding. 27 To Coleridge this view of the ultimate structure of reality was both incredible to human experience of the world and intolerable to human needs. As no more than a drastic subtraction from the rich diversity of sense-phenomena, it remains itself phenomenal, the product of what Coleridge re- peatedly described as a "slavery" to the senses, especially to the eye. The "needlepoint pinshead System of the Atomists" was a fictional product of that "slavery to the eye" which reduces "the conceivable . . . within the bounds of the pictura- ble," and excludes "all modes of existence which the theorist cannot in imagination, at least, finger and peep at !" 28 Against this world-picture, in the literal sense of "picture" as something that can be visualized, Coleridge again and again brings the charge that it is, precisely speaking, lethal. It has killed the living and habitable world of ordinary experience, as well as the metaphysical world of the pre-Cartesian and pre-Newtonian past, in which the mind of man had recognized an analogon to itself and to its life, purposes, senti- ments, values, and needs; a world, therefore, in which man was a participant and could feel thor- oughly at home.

And against this "philosophy of death," which leaves only the "relations of unproductive particles to each other," he posed his own phi- losophy of life, in which "the two component counter-powers actually interpenetrate each other, and generate a higher third, including both the former. . . 29 That is, in radical opposition to the picture of a world composed of particles of matter in motion, to whose impact an alien mind is passively recep- tive, Coleridge sets up what, following Schelling, he calls a "vital," or "dynamic," or "constructive" philosophy. The elements of this philosophy are not moving material particles but inherent ener- gies, or "powers," that polarize into positive and negative "forces" (also called "thesis and anti- thesis") which operate according to "the universal Law of Polarity or essential Dualism." 30 By this Coleridge means that the generative and sustain- ing elements of his universe exist only relatively to each other and manifest an irremissive tendency on the one hand to oppose themselves and on the other hand to reunite. These powers and forces are not physical or phenomenal, but metascientific and pre-phenomenal elements (in Coleridge's terms, they are not "real" but "ideal"), hence they cannot be pictured, but only imagined; they do, however, within the phenomenal world which they bring into being, have especially close and revealing analogues that Coleridge calls their "ex- ponents." It is only by their "living and genera- tive interpenetration," or "synthesis," that the polar powers and forces achieve the condition of matter, and so move into the phenomenal realm available to the senses. "In all pure phae- nomena," Coleridge says, "we behold only the copula, the balance or indifference of opposite en- ergies," and "matter" is to be considered "a Prod- uct-coagulum spiritfis, the pause, by interpene- tration of opposite energies." 31 29 To Lord Liverpool, Collected Letters 4: pp. 760-761; The Statesman's Manual, pp. 94-95; see also p. 105. 30 The Friend 1: p. 94n; and see Collected Letters 6: p. 601. 31 The Statesman's Manual, p. 95; to Lord Liverpool, Collected Letters 4: p. 760; to C.

A lucid and comprehensive treatment of the role of these ideas in the various areas of Coleridge's mature thinking is Owen Barfield's What Coleridge Thought (Middletown, Conn., 1971). We are at length ready to turn back to Cole- ridge's enigmatic statement, in his letter to C. A. Tulk of September, 1817, that "Color is Gravita- tion under the power of Light . . . while Sound on the other hand is Light under the power or paramountcy of Gravitation." "The two Poles of the material Universe," Coleridge there says, are "Light and Gravitation." Or as he wrote in a manuscript note: Well then, I say that all Powers may be reduced, in the first instance, into Light &amp; Gravity. But each of these beget two other powers. Under Gravity we place Attraction and Repulsion: and under Light the Powers of Contraction and Dila- tion.. .32 That is, the two elemental counter-powers that generate the cosmos he calls "light" and "gravity." These are not the light we see nor the weight, or gravitational force, we feel; they exist on a dif- ferent ontological plane as "speculative" or "ideal" powers of which phenomenal light and weight serve as the closest "exponents" in experience. Each of these two powers evolves two counter- forces, constituting a quadrant of forces that Cole- ridge represents graphically as a North-South line crossed by an East-West line: gravity involves a pull in and its opposite, a push out, while light pulses radially in all directions and at the same time contracts back to its center. The continuous and incremental syntheses of the two counter- powers of gravity and light constitute the material elements and bodies of everything that exists. The innumerable qualitative differences among ex- isting things, hence among the phenomena per- ceived by the senses, are determined by which of these two elemental powers-at any given level of their synthesis-is "predominant," in a range of ratios that extends from the extreme predomi- nance of gravity, through a mid-point of "indiffer- ence" or "neutralization" between the two powers, to the extreme predominance of light. "That a 32 From a manuscript quoted by Barfield, What Cole- ridge Thought, p. 141.

The metaphysical enigma has, I trust, become transparent enough so that we can look through it at the initial mystery of "The Eolian Harp," line 28: "A light in sound, a sound-like power in light." Seated in close communion with his bride and luxuriously open to the light and color and sounds of the outer world, the poet, by a leap of imagination, achieves insight to the common pre-phenomenal powers of which all these phe- nomena are exponents, and so apprehends the unity within their qualitative diversity-sounds that incorporate the elemental counter-power of light, and light that, appearing as color, incor- porates the elemental counter-power of gravity. For as we have seen, the power of gravitation, when predominant over the "co-present" power of light, manifests itself to the senses as sound, and when subordinate to light, manifests itself to the senses as color. II. THE ONE LIFE In wlhat Coleridge called his "speculative," as opposed to "empirical," science of nature and life, he "constructs" (in the sense of rendering intel- ligible by reference to a single genetic principle) the total universe. Driven by their inherent stresses of opposition-in-unity, and manifesting in the struggle diverse degrees of relative "predomi- nance," the powers of light and gravity evolve, by the progressive synthesis of prior syntheses, through the several distinctive orders of organiza- tion that Coleridge, following Schelling, calls "po- tences." 34 At each level of organization, entities are linked by correspondences-according to an equivalence in the predominance of light or gravity 33The Theory of Life, p. 69; compare p. 58.

On the first level of potence we get magnetism, electricity, and galvanism (which to Coleridge includes chemical combination), then all the forms of the inorganic world, then the forms of the organic world of plants and animals up to the highest stage of organic life, man; at which point mind, or "con- sciousness," emerges. This culminating achieve- ment is a radical break-through in the develop- mental process, for consciousness is capable of a reflex act by which-in a continuing manifestation of "the universal Law of Polarity" whereby it counterposes, in order to reconcile, the outer world as "object" to itself as "subject" 35-it re-engenders as knowledge the natural world within which it has itself been engendered, and of which it re- mains an integral part. Thus man's mind closes the evolutionary circle of polar generation by the powers of light and gravitation, the human and the non-human world merging at the focal point of consciousness. We come to the moment in line 26 of "The Eolian Harp"-"O! the one Life within us and abroad !" Coleridge's preoccupation with the one Life as a truth manifested in highest human ex- perience, but alien to the post-Newtonian world- picture, goes back long before 1816 or 1817 when he added this passage to the poem. As early as 1802, for example, he had written to Sotheby that Nature will have her proper interest only to him "who believes &amp; feels, that every Thing has a Life of its own, &amp; that we are all one Life." In the Hebrew Psalmists, unlike the mythological poets among the Greeks, you find "genuine Imagination." In the Hebrew Poets each Thing has a Life of it's own, &amp; yet they are all one Life. In God they move &amp; live, &amp; have their Being-not had, as the cold Sys- tem of Newtonian Theology represents, but have.36 And in the conversation poems that Coleridge wrote within several years after the 1796 version of "The Eolian Harp," the climax of each medita- tion on a landscape had been a moment of insight -the sudden awareness of a single Presence be- hind and within the phenomena of sense. In all these early poems, however, the visionary moment had been described in terms that had long been 35 Biographia Literaria 1: pp. 173-188; for the descrip- tion of human perception as a "repetition" of "the eternal act of creation," see p. 202. 36 Collected Letters 2: pp. 864-866; the Biblical echo is from Acts 17.28.

In "The Eolian Harp" of 1796, the poet tentatively put forward a latter-day version of the Stoic World-Soul-"one intellectual breeze" -as the principle that makes all animated nature "tremble into thought." In other conversation poems the poet found "religious meanings in the forms of nature!" or discovered that nature was an orthodox "Temple" built by "God" and that the diversified landscape "seem'd like Omnipres- ence!"; or else the landscape manifested itself to be God's veiled self-revelation, of such hues As veil the Almighty Spirit, when yet he makes Spirits perceive his presence; or (in the concept that had persisted from early Christian exegetes through Bishop Berkeley) the objects and aspects of the landscape were recog- ilized to be verba visibilia in God's Book of Nature, The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible Of that eternal language which thy God Utters. . . .37 Now, some fifteen years later, the metascience of nature that Coleridge had evolved from German Naturphilosophie provided him with a full and detailed conceptual structure to support and ar- ticulate his earlier intuitions. In this scheme, in which all matter and spirit are generated by the interplay of the same elemental powers, there is no gap between the living and lifeless, nature and man, or matter and mind, but only a distinction of levels of organization. "What is not Life," Coleridge asks, "that really is?" For "in the identity of the two counter-powers, Life subsists; in their strife it consists: and in their reconcilia- tion it at once dies and is born again into a new form." This "universal life" of ever-renewing strife and reconciliation pulses through all indi- vidual forms and all the orders of being, beginning with "the life of metals"-where in "its utmost latency . . . life is one with the elementary powers of mechanism" 38-Up through the progres- sive levels of "individuation" to the human con- sciousness, which in its living reciprocity with its 37The quotations are from: "Fears in Solitude," 1. 24; "Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement," 11. 38-39; "This Lime-Tree Bower," 11. 41-43; "Frost at Midnight," 11. 59-61. 38 Coleridge, Theory of Life, pp. 38, 40, 42, 51-52, 70. Cf. Schelling, Von der Weltseele, Sammtliche Werke 2: p. 374: "The source of life in the universal or great Nature is therefore the copula between gravitation and the light-essence [Lichtwesen] ; except that this source from which all things flow is concealed in universal Nature and is not itself visible." specific contrary, nature, is capable of achieving the awareness that there is only one Life within us and abroad. Hence the statement I quoted earlier from Cole- ridge's letter to C. A. Tulk that "the Life of Nature" consists in the sustained tendency of the poles of "Light and Gravitation" to separate and re-unite.39 But this same revealing letter, written within a few months of the final version of "The Eolian Harp," makes it plain that Coleridge's intuition of "the one Life within us and abroad" has not merely a metascientific basis, but a Bibli- cal one as well. It will help to clarify this essen- tial aspect of Coleridge's thought-and of the poem-if we turn back to consider the significance of Coleridge's statement to Tieck, that same year, that he had adopted the idea of the relation of light and gravity to color and sound "probably from Behmen's Aurora, which I had conjured over at School." The Aurora, written in 1611-1612, was the first of Jacob Boehme's books; it is incomplete, and even more obscure than Boehme's later ex- positions of his esoteric but very influential doc- trines. Through its fantastic terminology and melodramatic narration, however, we can make out its basic concepts and design. Boehme's undertaking is to elucidate the mystery of the creation of the world and of man, as the initial episode in the history of human and cosmic sal- vation. He bases his account of the creation on chapter one of Genesis (which he regards as in fact the story of a second creation, intended to repair the wreck of the angelic world occasioned by the fall of the angel Lucifer) and also upon the commentary on the creation in the Gospel of St. John (on which Boehme largely relies for his account of the first creation of a perfect world). But Boehme claims that he has been inspired by divine grace infused "in my spirit," and that he is therefore able to decipher the spiritual truths concealed within the esoteric sound-symbolism of the literal Biblical narrative.40 Boehme's svm- 39Collected Letters 4: p. 771; and see the letter to Gillman, 10 Nov., 1816, ibid., p. 690.

SOC. bolic interpretation of the creation (more accu- rately, of the two creations) turns out, in fact, to be mainly a remarkably elaborated version of the doctrines and terminology he had learned (at this period of his life, at second hand) from the alchemical philosophy of Paracelsus and other Renaissance Hermeticists. To Boehme, the essential condition for all crea- tivity and progression, both in being and in think- ing, is a strenuous tension between contraries, or opposed forces, whose sequential separations and unions give rise to everything that exists. The archetypal struggle in the fallen world is between the contrary forces of good and evil, love and hate, but these are destined to eventuate in the triumph of good and love in the coming redemption. Even the original creation of the angelic world, however, resulted from the energy generated by opponent principles. For God the Father mani- fests a joyous union of divine powers that Boehme calls, collectively, the "Salliter," or the "Sal-niter." This totality involves seven different Qualitaten, which Boehme derives from Quelle and quellen ("a spring," "to gush forth"), and which are therefore not what we ordinarily call "qualities," but "pow- ers" or "forces" (Krdfte). Each one of these ele- mental powers is a balance of opposing contraries, and each also has its appropriate counter-power. From the divine Salliter, in the successive unions and renewed oppositions of the diverse opponent powers and forces, issues all that constitutes the world, from stones and metals through plants and animals to the body and spirit of man, who as microcosm is the perfect analogue of the world's body and spirit. In Boehme's world there is thus no gap between animate and inanimate, body and mind, conscient and inconscient-all are an emanation of the powers of the one Deity, and throughout all there surges one life, exhibiting itself in the conflict and interpenetration of the same vital forces. In this great radiation outward from the divine source of all life and being, Boehme puts by far the greatest stress on the role in creation of two elements, sound and light. The reasons for this emphasis are patent. In the Book of Genesis God's creation is by word, or sound. His first creative sounds are, "Let there be light," which forthwith becomes light, and His later creative sounds become all forms of life, including man. And in the first chapter of John we find the crea- tive fiat represented as the Word, which is equated with light, and also with life, and finally becomes itself incarnate: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.... All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth it not.... And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us. Boehme repeatedly echoes these passages from Genesis and John (see, e.g., Chapters XVIII and XXVI). In his symbolic translation of them into a philosophy of nature, light is not repre- sented as one of the primal powers, but as gen- erated from the ensemble of the seven powers; as Boehme puts it, light is "perpendicular" to the ontological plane of the powers. This light is equated with the Son, as well as with the sun, the "place" of light in the heavens; while in man, the light constitutes his soul and spirit. Sound, on the other hand, is one of the seven elemental powers within the divine Salliter itself; this power Boehme calls "Mercurius" (that is, Mercury or Hermes Trismegistus, the great magus of the Hermetic philosophers). Boehme identifies this "sound" (Schall) with the creative voice and with the harmony of the heavenly music; accordingly, from this "sound, tone, tune or noise . . . ensued speech, language, and the distinction of every- thing, as also the ringing melody and singing of the holy angels, and therein consisteth the form- ing or framing of all colours, beauty and orna- ment, as also the heavenly joyfulness" (Aurora, X. 1). In its manifestation as speech, sound serves as the vehicle for the expression of spirit, hence as the vehicle (in God's creative fiat) by which the third aspect of God, the Holy Spirit, expresses itself. Sound, in Boehme's intricate sys- tem of analogies and identities, thus is equated with the Word, or divine Logos itself, and so is integral with light and life and the Son, as an element in the triune nature of God which mani- fests itself throughout the creation. Whatever the extent of his claimed knowledge of The Aurora during his schooldays, we know that Coleridge closely studied and copiously anno- tated this and other books by Boehme, in the English "Law edition," from the year 1807 on, just prior to and collaterally with his immersion in Schelling and other Naturphilosophen during</page><page sequence="12">VOL. 116, NO. 6, 19721 COLERIDGE'S "A LIGHT IN SOUND" 469 the second decade of the nineteenth century.41 Coleridge's thinking was inveterately organic and genetic, always traveling back to the radical of a view-or as he called it, to the "seminal" idea -which has proved historically capable of grow- ing into a total metaphysic.42 It is clear even from my brief summation that he found a great deal in Boehme's dualistic vitalism that suited his own mature "dynamic" philosophy; and in the letter to Ludwig Tieck, as well as in his private annotations, Coleridge tended to impose on Boehme's inchoate views the terms and structure of the metascience he had developed on the basis of contemporary German thinkers. It was in line with this persistent tendency (and not in order to hide his debt to Schelling) that Coleridge inter- preted Boehme's arcane statements about the pri- mary roles of light and sound in nature to accord with his own doctrines about the elemental counter-powers of gravitation and light and their relative "predominance" in the diverse phenomena of sound and color.43 But what in Boehme's writings made the great- est appeal to Coleridge, as against Schelling's early Naturphilosophie, was that Boehme had derived his scheme of nature from the Biblical accounts of the creation, although Coleridge feared that Boehme had not entirely avoided the "Pantheism" that he found blatantly manifested in Schelling- the assimilation of a transcendent Creator into a 41 See Richard Haven, Patterns of Consciousness, p. 89; and on Coleridge's relations to Boehme as well as Schelling, pp. 89-96, 134-135, 138-142. 42 Thus Coleridge persistently traced his, as well as Schelling's, views back through Boehme and Giordano Bruno to the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus: Cole- ridge's own dynamic philosophy, he said, is no more than "Heraclitus redivivus." (To Tulk, Collected Letters 4: p. 775; see also ibid., p. 760 and The Friend 1: p. 94n.) 43 For specific passages in Boehme's Aurora that ex- hibit some similarity to Coleridge's views on light, sound, and color, see Duane B. Schneider, "Coleridge's Light- Sound Theory," and J. B. Beer, "Coleridge and Boehme's Aurora," in Notes and Queries (May, 1963), pp. 182- 183 and 183-187. In his reply (ibid., May, 1966, pp. 176- 178), Richard Haven cites among other materials Cole- ridge's annotation (written ca. 1817) on The Aurora, IV.27: "27 is admirable-the Messenger or Mercury of the Salitter is indeed Sound, which is but Light under the paramouncy of Gravitation. It is the Mass-Light." Haven comments, justly, that this concept is presented by Coleridge not as Boehme's own idea, but "as an as- sumed principle in terms of which Boehme's obscure state- ments may be rendered intelligible and sensible," and that it is based on a "system of natural philosophy, obviously heavily indebted to the work of Schelling and Steffens." religion of Nature." As far back as the letter to Sotheby of 1802, it will be recalled, Coleridge had discovered the sense of "one Life" within all things, specifically, in "the Hebrew poets" of the Old Testament. Now, in a marginal comment on The Aurora, he comments on Boehme's treatment of light in the creation and Incarnation: That not Heat but Light is the Heart of Nature is one of those truly profound and pregnant Thoughts that ever and anon astonish me in Boehme's writings. . . . The affinity . . . of the Flesh and Blood gen- erally to Light I trust that I shall make clear in my commentaries on the first and sixth chapters of the Gospel of John. Hence in the Logos (distinctive energy) is Light, and the Light became the Life of Man.45 The "commentaries" on John to which Coleridge alludes he planned to include in his Logosophia, the comprehensive philosophical work on which he labored for decades but never completed. In this "Opus Maximum," the exposition of his own "Dy- namic or Constructive Philosophy" was to be "preparatory" to "a detailed Commentary on the Gospel of St. John," in order "to prove that Christianity is true Philosophy"; and this section was in turn to be followed by a treatise on "the Mystics &amp; Pantheists," including Jacob Boehme." We return to the indispensable letters that Cole- ridge wrote to C. A. Tulk in 1817 and early 1818. There he begins his "rude and fragmentary" sketch of "the Science of the Construction of Nature" with God, who is the absolute "Identity" or "Prothesis" which precedes any polarity be- tween thesis and antithesis; Coleridge comments that to adopt the alternative, the "Lockian, and Newtonian" Creator as "an hypothetical Watch- maker," is in fact to "live without God in the world." And he begins his construction of nature -"the Genesis . . . the Birth of Things"-with an interpretation of the opening sentence of the 44See, e.g., Biographia Literaria 1: pp. 98-99, and Thomas McFarland, Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradi- tion (Oxford, 1969), especially Excursus XIX, "Cole- ridge and Boehme." After the turn of the nineteenth century, Schelling himself increasingly built Boehme's concepts into his own philosophy, but without emulating Boehme's persistent attempt to maintain an identity be- tween the first principle of his philosophy of nature, the personal God of the Bible, and the triune God of Chris- tian doctrine. 45As transcribed by Alice D.

Book of Genesis, "In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth." Coleridge's her- meneutics is based on his view that the Bible embodies the ideas of "reason" in the mode of "imagination," hence that it is "a science of reali- ties" expressed in "symbols." His interpretation of the Biblical accounts of the creation, therefore, like Boehme's, is symbolic, although on quite dif- ferent grounds.47 I will not reconstruct the exegetic maneuvers by which Coleridge translates "And the Earth was waste and void . . . and Darkness on the Deep" to signify that what first came into existence was "gravitation," whiclh is best designated by "the combination of the Ideas, Darkness &amp; the Deep or Depth." He continues: And God said-Let there be Light: and there was Light. And God divided the Light from the Dark- ness-i.e., Light from Gravitation . . . and the two Poles of the material Universe are established, viz. Light and Gravitation. . . . The Life of Nature con- sists in the tendency of the Poles to re-unite.... God is the Sun of the Universe-it's gravitation or Being by his Omnipresence, it's Light by his only- begotten Son . . . Deus alter et idem! He also conjoins the account of the creation of light in Genesis with the commentary on the crea- tive Logos in the opening chapter of John: God SAID, Let there be Light: and there became LIGHT! In the beginning was the Word. All things became . . . through the Word, the living and vivific Word . . . whose Life is the Light of men. . . . The Light . . . rose up in the Darkness and in the Depth-and in and with it became . . . the two Primary Poles of Nature, Light and Gravitation.... On these grounds Coleridge proceeds to "con- struct" the orders of being and of sense-phenom- ena that make up the universe, including, in the passage which is our central concern, the construc- tion of color as "Gravitation under the power of Light" and of sound as "light under the power or paramountcy of Gravitation." 48 Coleridge's inserted passage in "The Eolian Harp," then, is only the visible tip of a massive complex of submerged ideas, scientific and meta- 47Collected Letters 4: pp. 767-769. For Coleridge's exposition of the Scriptures as a "system of symbols," products of the faculty of "imagination," which incor- porates the ideas of reason "in images of the sense," see The Statesman's Manual, pp. 31-34, and p. 84: "True natural philosophy is comprised in the study of the sci- ence and language of symbols," and a symbol is not "a figure of speech or of fancy, but an actual and essential part of that, the whole of which it represents." 48 Collected Letters 4: pp. 770-773, 805-806. scientific, Scriptural and theological. We know enough of this substructure to recognize now that the poet's moment of vision is also a theophany, and that the oxymorons in which the moment is expressed signify not only the "law of contra- diction," or polarity, on which Coleridge's meta- science is based, but also the central Christian mysteries. For in Coleridge's interwoven uni- verse of correspondences and analogues, of expo- nents and symbols, "a light in sound" is the distant reflection of the light generated by the primal sound, "Let there be light," while "a sound- like power in light" is the distant echo of the creative Word which became flesh and is the Light as well as the Life both of nature and man. In line 27, this one Life "meets all motion and becomes its soul." In the Newtonian world-pic- ture, motion-as measured by the altering posi- tion, through time, of particles of matter in space -had been an elementary postulate. Coleridge, however, by intricate reasoning derives "ideal" (pre-phenomenal) time and space from his own first premise, or "Prothesis," as the primitive polar opposites whose synthesis constitutes "mo- tion." He conceives motion, that is, as a point moving through space in time, so that it forms, and is represented graphically by, a line; and the bipolar line, in the next synthesis, achieves a third dimension as "depth." Coleridge cryptically sum- marizes to Tulk the role of these elementary con- structs in generating the universe: Time X Space = Motion. Attraction X Repulsion Gravity as Depth.-These are ideal relations. The ideal + real, or rather the Ideal = Real, World arises out of chaos (=Indistinction) or begins, with the creation of Light. He adds, however, that "a Life, a Power, an Inside, must have pre-existed" the ideal dimen- sions of time, space, motion, and depth, of which "the LIFE appearing" in the real, or material, world is the result; and that this process of the "interpenetration of opposite energies," of which matter is a product, sustains itself, as process, to constitute the "spirit" in all matter.49 Otherwise stated: the elemental rhythm of opposing and in- terpenetrating polarities in which life consists, when it meets all "ideal" motion, brings it into existence as matter, in which the continuing pul- sation of the one Life constitutes the spirit or soul; and this vital outer rhythm, he goes on to 49 Ibid., pp. 771, 774-775.

III. JOYANCE Now, what of the "joyance every where" in line 29? "Joy" and "joyance" were specialized terms, used by Coleridge as the emotional index to a particular relationship between the conscious self and the outer world. To clarify its significance in "The Eolian Harp," we need to consider again Coleridge's evolving scale of being, at the point at which the reflexive consciousness emerges in man. Man, Coleridge says in his letters to Tulk, rep- resents the ultimate product of the two contrary "ends" of the life-process, namely "Individualiza- tion, or apparent detachment from Nature-pro- gressive Organization" and "the re-union with Nature as the apex of Individualization." 50 And since, as he says in the contemporary work, the Theory of Life, "the form of polarity" applies at this as at every evolutionary stage, "the intensi- ties must be at once opposite and equal," so that the independence of an individual man should ideally be matched by "interdependence" with other men in the social organization, while "as the ideal genius and the originality [i.e., the high- est degree of human autonomy], in the same proportion must be the resignation to the real world, the sympathy and the intercommunion with Nature," which exists "in counterpoint to him." 51 But although man is both product and participant in the universal process of life, he is radically different from the rest of nature, in that by achiev- ing consciousness, he also achieves freedom of the will. As Coleridge puts it in the same passage, man "is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge"; and here things can go drastically wrong. For an excess in the tendency to indi- viduation-especially when fostered by untoward "hardships" and "circumstances"-can force "a man in upon his little unthinking contemptible self," and so cut the individual consciousness off from the sense of its interdependence with other men and its intercomnmunion with outer nature.52 50 Collected Letters 4: p. 807. And to Tulk, ibid., p. 769: From the coral to the man of genius, who represents "the maximum of Individuation . . . the whole process is cyclical tho' progressive, and the Man separates from Nature only that Nature may be found again in a higher dignity in the Man. ..." 51 Theory of Life, pp. 85-86. 52 Ibid., p. 86; Philosophical Lectures, p. 179. To be cut off from all relationship to man and nature, to suffer what he called "the evils of separation and finiteness," 53 was to Coleridge as to other romantic thinkers and poets the radical affliction of the human condition. This is the state to which the romantic philosopher, Hegel, gave the name "alienation," and it is, as Coleridge saw it, the inescapable situation of anyone who accepts the Newtonian world-picture, the dead universe of matter in motion, as existential reality. "Joy," on the other hand, is the term Coleridge specifically appropriated to the state of mind in which all alienation is annulled-it is an equipoise of the contrary mental powers, manifested in an inner life so abundant that it breaks through the barrier of self to yield awareness of the one Life that is shared with other selves and with nature. As Coleridge says about "joy" in his Philosophical Lectures, with respect to "genius," which is the term he uses for the creative power of the human mind and imagination: All genius exists in a participation of a common spirit. In joy individuality is lost. . . . To have a genius is to live in the universal, to know no self but that which is reflected not only from the faces of all around us, our fellow creatures, but reflected from the flowers, the trees, the beasts, yea from the very surface of the [waters and the] sands of the desert.54 To this I shall add a contemporary statement by Coleridge in The Friend of 1818. This passage, in its context, ascribes the scientific world-picture to an alienation of mind from nature, and counters it, as the premise of philosophy, with the primal in- tuition of an integrity of the self and not-self, mind and nature, of which the sign in human con- sciousness is the condition called "joy": The ground-work, therefore, of all true philosophy is the full apprehension of the difference between . . . that intuition of things which arises when we possess ourselves, as one with the whole . . . and that which presents itself when . . . we think of ourselves as separated beings, and place nature in antithesis to the mind, as object to subject, thing to thought, death to life. This is abstract knowledge, or the science of the mere understanding. . . [The former on the 53A marginal annotation to Boehme, as transcribed by Haven, Patterns of Consciousness, p. 127.

SOC. other hand] is an eternal and infinite self-rejoicing, self-loving, with a joy unfathomable, with a love all comprehensive.55 IV. LOVE In this intuition of the community of all life, the movement from "a joy unfathomable" to "a love all comprehensive" parallels the movement in "The Eolian Harp" from "joyance every where" to the universal love described in the next four lines, which Coleridge revised and integrated with the added passage on the one Life: Rhythm in all thought, and joyance every where- Methinks, it should have been impossible Not to love all things in a world so filled.... There remains, in conclusion, to show the relation in Coleridge's thinking at this period between all- comprehensive love and the elemental powers of gravity and light, as these manifest themselves in a light in sound. In this instance, too, the connection is estab- lished in one of his letters to C. A. Tulk. There having "constructed," on both metascientific and Biblical grounds, "the two Primary Poles of Na- ture, Light and Gravitation," he goes on to say that these "correlatives and correspondent Oppo- sites, by and in which the Unity is revealed," are (to borrow your happy and most expressive Symbol) the Male and female of the World of Time, in whose wooings, and retirings and nuptial conciliations all other marriages . . . are celebrated inclusively.- These truths it is my Object to enforce in the manner best fitted (alas! how hopeless even the best!) to the present age.56 To indicate what lies behind this astonishing attribution of sexuality to all phenomenal nature ("the World of Time") requires another look, from a different vantage point, at Coleridge's metascientific enterprise. The post-Newtonian world-picture repelled him because it had been deliberately stripped bare of any correlative to the life of man and any sanction for human pur- poses and values. While a young man of thirty Coleridge had written to Southey that "a meta- physical Solution, that does not instantly tell for something in the Heart, is grievously to be sus- pected as apocryphal," and in Biographia Litera- ria, contemporaneously with the last version of "The Eolian Harp," he extolled Boehme, despite the "delusions" and fantasies he found mixed with his "truths," because he had contributed "to 55 The Friend 1: pp. 520-521. 56 Collected Letters 4: p. 806. keep alive the heart in the head; gave me . . . [a] presentiment, that all the products of the mere reflective faculty partook of DEATH. . . ." 57 Coleridge meant that, as man cannot live by sci- ence alone-in his terms, by the evidence of the senses ordered by the "reflective" faculty, the "understanding"-neither can he endure a uni- verse constructed to suit the narrow requirements of Newtonian physics rather than the large re- quirements of human life. Coleridge undertook to develop an alternative world-vision that would suffice to the heart as well as the head, by supple- nenting science with imagination-as he put it in terms of his faculty-philosophy, the phenomena of "the senses," as classed and ordered by "the understanding," are to be "impregnated" by "the imagination," and so reconciled and mediated to the requirements of the supreme and inclusive power of mind, "the reason." 58 'We can translate Coleridge's terms into the idiom of our own time. His prime endeavor, like that of his contemporaries, the great German architects of all-inclusive metaphysical "systems," was to assimilate the findings and hypotheses of contemporary science to the inherent demands and forms of the human imagination, in the kind of inclusive vision of man in the world that Northrop Frye calls a "myth of concern." 59 In this under- taking man is put back into nature, from which the sophisticated logic of scieince had severed him, by applying the primitive imaginative categories of analogy, correspondence, and identity. Through this procedure nature is once more endowed with the inherent energies of life and with humanly intelligible purposes and values, and so constitutes a milieu in which man can fully live and be at home. And since the cultural myth of concern that Coleridge had inherited was the Judeo-Chris- tian one set forth in the Bible, and since Coleridge felt a greater need than contemporary German philosophers to salvage the essentials of its creed of salvation, he undertook explicitly to ground his world-vision on bases common both to the Old a-id New Testament and to "speculative physics." No doubt Coleridge would have rejected this description, since it transposes the criterion of his intricately rationalized system from a truth of correspondence to ultimate reality to a truth 577 Aug., 1803, Collected Letters 2: p. 961; Biographia Literaria 1: pp. 95-98. 58 The Statesman's Maniuial, pp. 73-74; see also p. 31. 59 See Northrop Frye, "The Critical Path," in In Search of Literary Theory, ed.

But Schelling, I think, might well have accepted it, for Schelling was one of the German philosophers who helped establish the present views, of which Northrop Frye is a distinguished representative, that human needs inevitably compel the creation of a mythology to live by, in civilized no less than in primitive societies. Schelling as- serted that in the modern world the mythology of the ancients has been outworn, while "the mythology of Christendom" is unsuitable for valid poetry, so that now "every truly creative indi- vidual has to create his own mythology." All these separate creations, however, will prove, in the in- determinate future, to be parts of a single system of myth. The pre-eminent material for this evolv- ing mythology is contemporary Naturphilosophie, such as he has himself developed. It is his con- viction, Schelling says, "that in the higher specu- lative physics is to be sought the possibility of a future mythology and symbolism," which will rec- oncile the contraries between the pagan and Chris- tian mythologies in one vision of nature; but this achievement, he adds, will be the work not of any one individual, but of "the entire era." 60 Conspicuous in Schelling's own later Naturphi- losophie is its tendency to move from abstract concepts to explicitly anthropomorphic and mythi- cal formulations. This tendency is most obvious in the instance of his basic principle of polarity. In his early writings Schelling had based this category on the concepts of bipolarity in recent scientific developments in magnetism and electric- ity, as well as on Kant's essay of 1786, which undertook a "metaphysical" derivation of the primitive "matter" of Newtonian physics from the elemental "powers" of attraction and repulsion.61 60 Schelling, Philosophie der Kunst, Sammtliche Werke 5: pp. 442-449. Friedrich Schlegel had earlier pronounced the need for a "new mythology" to serve as the ground for modern poetry, and anticipated the emergence of such a mythology from a synthesis between current philosophi- cal idealism and the discoveries of contemporary natural science.

Both Schelling and Coleridge refer repeatedly to tlhis essay. Goethe's science, in his Metamorphosis of Plants (1790) and The Theory of Colors (1810), was candidly based on the concept of the quasi-sexual generative power of contraries throughout the realm of nature. See Ronald D. Gray, Goethe the Alchemist (Cambridge, 1952), chap. 10. Coleridge in his turn based his early formulations of the polar-principle on the theory of his scien- tific friend, Humphrey Davy, that all substances are the product of elementary forces, even before he absorbed the views of Kant and the metaphysi- cal system of Schelling.62 Coleridge, however, rightly pointed back to a long tradition, from "the Dynamic Theory of the eldest Philosophy" in the pre-Socratic thinkers, through Renaissance Her- meticism, to Jacob Boehme as precedent to Schell- ing in putting forward "the universal law of polarity." 63 In these earlier thinkers the philo- sophical representation of an all-originative and sustaining interplay of elemental opposites had not yet completely emerged from its origins in a cosmic myth of universal bisexuality-the myth of male and female divinities or powers, antithetic and warring yet mutually attractive and neces- sary, which periodically merge in unions that beget the world and all things in it. In its older forms, in other words, universal polarity had been de- rived from bisexual procreation as its prototype; and it is the sexual dimension of human nature, we may plausibly conjecture, that gives the myth of cosmic bisexuality its persisting hold on imagi- nation even today, in current forms of the "peren- nial philosophy." After all, as Schelling remarked, human union and procreation is "the single in- stance in which we are to a certain extent per- mitted to be witnesses of an original creation." 64 In his early writings of 1797, Schelling at times referred to the contrary powers of gravity and light as the feminine or "mother-principle" and the masculine or "procreative principle," which are "represented" or "expressed" in the differentiated sexes of the higher organisms.65 Increasingly after that he dramatized his metaphysics of po- larity by endowing it with anthropomorphic fea- 62 On Humphrey Davy's early theories, and Coleridge's use of them before he began an intensive study of Schel- ling, see Haven, Patterns of Consciousness, pp. 134-141. 63 The Friend 1: p. 94n.; to Lord Liverpool, Collected Letters 4: p. 760. Coleridge goes on (p. 761) to decry the modern view that "nothing grows, all is made," as against "the ancients," with their basic view of "the natura rerum-i.e. the birth of things," their search after "the acts of the world," and their central use of "the symbol of begetting." 64 Schelling, The Ages of the World, trans.

He wrote in 1804, for example, that "made pregnant by light, gravity gives birth to the diverse forms of things and delivers them from her fruitful womb to inde- pendent life." Driven by the compulsion to pro- gressive individuation, the powers of gravity and light, at the organic stage of evolution, separate first into the bisexual organs in a single plant, then into the separate sexes of the animal and human realms. Yet every individual remains the product of both powers, and each monosexual in- dividual needs its polar opposite in order to fulfill the contrary compulsion of nature toward identity. "This is the secret of eternal love . . . in that each is a whole, yet desires the other and seeks the other." Hence: As the being and life of nature rests on the eternal embrace of light and gravity, so the unions of the two sexes, their begetting and propagation of innu- inerable species, are nothing else than the celebration of the eternal love of those two [powers] which, when they could have been two, yet wanted to be one, and thereby created all of nature.66 Such also are the grounds of Coleridge's state- ment, in his letter to Tulk, that light and gravita- tion are "the male and female of the World of Time, in whose wooings and retirings and nuptial conciliations all other marriages . . . are cele- brated inclusively." Like the German Naturphi- losophen, Coleridge sometimes mythicized his metascience, to humanize his vision of a natural world whose diverse orders of being are linked by familial correspondences to man and mind, and whose processes are compelled by inconscient analogues of love and hate, of oppositions and marriages. Hence those strange passages in Cole- ridge's speculative natural history that seem to a casual reader to be merely fantasies based on free association. In a manuscript, for example, he declares that, though all the chemical elements contain the two counter-powers, "Gravity and Light with Warmth as the Indifference," yet be- cause of the differing "predominance of some one, Carbon most represents Gravity, Oxygen Light, and Hydrogen Warmth." When, in the sequential combinations of these chemical elements, nature achieves the plant, we find in its generative organ, the flower, "the qualitative product of Oxygen= Light in the outness and splendor of Colors, the 66 Schelling, System der gesammten Philosophie . . .

This work was un- known to Coleridge, since it was first published from the manuscript remains in the Sdmmtliche Werke in 1860. qualitative product of Hydrogen = Warmth in the inwardness and sweetness of Fragrance"; and this fragrance Coleridge interprets as the accompani- ment of "gentle love," of which the flower serves as a material symbol. And when-in the continu- ing genetic process of the "interpenetration" of the primal opposites, gravity and light-we reach the level of birds, we find that the colors of their plumage correspond to the colors of the flower, but that a new phenomenon, bird-song, or sound, has replaced the odors of flowers and taken over their biological function in ensuring fertilization. In birds, then, Coleridge says, we have "light in the form (under the power) of Gravity in Color, and Gravity sub forma et ditione Lucis subditione" -that is, "gravity subordinated to the form and dominion of light"-in the bird-song. The "sweet yearning varied by quiet provoking challenging sounds" are thus "the Surrogates of the Vegetable Odors-and like these, are the celebrations of the Nuptial moments, the hours of Love." 67 Such passages provide a bridge between the "sound-like power in light" and the love of all things in the inserted section of "The Eolian Harp." They provide also a broader perspective through which to review the long evolution of that poem between 1795 and 1817, as I described it at the beginning of this essay. In its first short form "The Eolian Harp" had been a love-poem which assimilated the relation of the wind and the strings of the harp to the dalliance, the "wooings and retirings," of the human lovers. It had next been developed into a marriage poem, and also expanded into a metaphysical speculation about "all of animated nature." In its final form it is still a love poem, but a cosmic love-poem, in which the love between the poet and his bride becomes the exponent of a universal relationship -the "union of the individual with the Universe" which, Coleridge said, occurs "through love." 68 It is still a marriage poem, too, but one in which the human union becomes an exponent of the pri- mal union in which "all other marriages are cele- brated inclusively." For in the lines added in 1817 the poet breaks through sensation into vision, in which the phenomenal aspects of the landscape, 67 Transcribed from manuscript by Kathleen Coburn, Inquiring Spirit, No. 185. 68 The Notebooks of S.

And however we may judge the metascientific and religious be- liefs that engendered the moment of vision, they have in this passage been transformed by the imagination from a creed into the poetry of im- mediate experience, and so compel our participa- tion independently of either belief or disbelief: 0! the one Life within us and abroad, Which meets all motion and becomes its soul, A light in sound, a sound-like power in light, Rhythm in all thought, and joyance every where- Methinks, it should have been impossible Not to love all things in a world so fill'd; Where the breeze warbles, and the mute still air Is music slumbering on her instrument. Coleridge, we know, printed this passage as an addendum to a poem already set in type. The insertion throws the whole poetic structure into imbalance by locating the climax of the medita- tion near the beginning. By 1817, however, Cole- ridge, though capable of poetic moments, was not capable of sustained poetic endeavor; as he said two years later, "Poeta fuimus," but "the Philoso- pher, tho' pressing with the weight of an Etna, cannot prevent the Poet from occasionally . . . manifesting his existence by smoke traversed by electrical flashes from the Crater." 69 In succeed- ing editions of "The Eolian Harp" Coleridge sim- ply transferred the added passage into the text without altering its context. But the poet's re- traction of his metaphysical speculations in the original conclusion to the poem had never been at ease with its surroundings either in tone or idiom, and after this high moment of religious as well as metaphysical imagination, the coda is rendered inconsequent as well as anticlimatic. 69 To Thomas Allsop, 13 Dec., 1819, Collected Letters 4: p. 979.
