Hardison, Jr. A Ťree, A Streamlined Fish, and a Self -Squared Dragon : Science as a Form of Culture Have we begun to understand even the old indus- trial revolution? Much less the new scientific revo- lution in which we stand? There was never anything more necessary to comprehend. - C. P. Snow, "The Two Cultures" I THE modern theme scientific of the following thought. This essay theme is the is emergence as simple of and new as values subtle in as modern scientific thought. This theme is as simple and as subtle as the movement in biology from observing nature in the middle perspec- tive, so beautifully illustrated by Audubon's paintings of the birds of North America, to electron-microscope photographs of the fine structure of living cells. D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson remarks at the end of his mathe- matical study of living forms that he is "advanced in these enquiries no farther than the threshold." It will be well for me to state at the beginning that my purpose is not to write a history of science or a work on the philosophy of science. Both tasks have been undertaken by authors eminently qualified for them, and although I have tried to learn from these authors, I am not in any sense attempting to follow where they have so ably led. I want, rather, to examine aspects of science that are legitimate subjects of cultural study, and thus to cross a barrier that has been posited at least since Francis Bacon's Novum Organum and that is the subject of C. P. Snow's much-quoted essay "The Two Cultures." I believe that human culture is a seamless web. No matter how fragmented our understanding of it, there is only one culture. Just as the analysis of culture often involves the techniques of science- as often happens, for [ 369]</page><page sequence="2">370 THE GEORGIA REVIEW instance, in archaeological, textual, psychoanalytic, and linguistic studies -science can be approached as a form of culture. To see it in this way is to see it not as a body of knowledge but as an agency of value; and in the twentieth century, science has become an agency of enormous power, in some respects replacing such traditional sources of value as religion, cus- tom, and history. Hence the urgency of Snow's questions: "Have we begun to understand even the old industrial revolution? Much less the new scientific revolution in which we stand?" In order to create a context, I will begin with some observations about two traditional poles of scientific thought. The first assumes that nature is an appearance which science must penetrate in order to discover reality. This is, in general, the point of view associated in Greek science with Pythagoras and the Plato of the Timaeus. The second pole is Ba- conian. It assumes that reality is what we see in front of us and that under- standing reality is a matter of disciplined observation. I need only to add that the two poles are by no means always opposed. Many- perhaps most- scientists move easily from one to the other, and back, as the demands of their projects change. After establishing a context, I will concentrate on three representa- tive figures whose work defines a kind of curve leading from the past to the present. Other figures could have been selected, but they might not have defined the curve as clearly or permitted the issues to emerge as fully. The three are Charles Darwin, D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, and Benoit Mandelbrot. Each expresses views typical of an important moment in the development of the values that are intrinsic to modern culture, but some interesting paradoxes emerge. Darwin's nature is, in theory, non- human and alien, but he pours emotion into it in much the same way that primitive man humanizes the world through myth. Thompson's nature is regular and elegant, the materialization of mathematics. It, too, seems alien until we realize that the mathematics is either the invention of God, as Thompson suggests in his "Epilogue," or a purely human creation, as Thompson undoubtedly believed in his less poetic moments. The nature revealed by Thompson is a nature devoid of myth, but it is saturated with the aesthetic qualities suggested by words like admiration, wonder, and beauty. Mandelbrot's nature is discontinuous and impossibly complex. Its order cannot be duplicated, so he creates a system parallel to nature, capable of producing things that are "something like" natural things. Mandelbrot's fractal geometry is in this sense fully human: it is invented by man and its products are entirely man-made. Their adequacy as fac-</page><page sequence="3">О. В. H ARDISON, JR. 37 1 similes of nature can be tested in the most empirical way: Mandelbrot's equations can be converted into computer graphics and then compared to natural images, much as Audubon's birds can be compared to their living counterparts. The equations meet this test so successfully that they have been used to create imaginary landscapes for movies and television fantasies. All of the texts I will examine here were intended by their authors to be accessible to the general reader as well as the scientist. Although the images of nature they reveal are quite distinct, each can be seen as pointing toward the next. Thompson is quite conscious of writing in the shadow of Darwin, and Mandelbrot refers several times to Thompson as in some sense a precursor in the effort to study the mathematical basis of nature. All three express values inherent in modern culture; in examining their work, we examine aspects of the world we inhabit in America in the closing years of the twentieth century. The efforts of Thompson and Mandelbrot to be accessible to readers who are not scientists point to a corollary theme of the present essay. C. P. Snow's challenge in "The Two Cultures" is usually understood to mean that students of culture should study mathematics and chemistry and ther- modynamics in order to be able to understand science, yet if his challenge is confronted seriously, it goes much deeper than that. The problem is that our visual and verbal languages change slowly, but for the past cen- tury our culture has been changing rapidly. Since we imagine by means of visual or verbal languages, this is a way of saying that we are no longer able to imagine the world- or, at least, that our languages are no longer synchronized with what we experience. It is understandable that Snow sees the problem as a lack of communication between two different cul- tures. His understanding, however, is wrong because it relates to symp- toms, not to causes. The problem of language is exemplified in science in the common assertion that the reality revealed by science cannot be expressed in natural language and is therefore inaccessible to imagination. Paul Dirac asserts in Quantum Mechanics (1930) that reality is no more accessible to visual languages than to verbal ones: "Fundamental laws do not govern the world as it appears in our mental picture in any very direct way, but instead they form a substratum of which we cannot form a mental picture without introducing irrelevancies." If Dirac is correct, all efforts to find languages capable of objectifying reality are doomed and may even be pernicious since they introduce "irrelevancies." There are, however, rea-</page><page sequence="4">372 THE GEORGIA REVIEW sons to be more optimistic than Dirac. Art, architecture, and poetry have all sought consciously to create new languages in the twentieth cen- tury, and the visual languages developed by modern art have been extraor- dinarily successful. As I hope to demonstrate, science has also created visual and verbal languages that have much to offer to those seeking to reestablish links between the imagination and the world. In the efforts of Darwin, Thompson, and Mandelbrot to be accessible to general readers as well as to specialists, we encounter one crucial set of these links- and we discover that, whatever else these men might have thought they were doing, one thing they have done is to lead us toward a sense of the "two cultures" as one. il The root meaning of Greek kosmos is "order" or "arrangement." It has the additional meanings of "comely order," "decoration," or "ornament." It is the source of English cosmos , and also of cosmetic. Greek science is the study of the comely and harmonious order of the world. It is more an aesthetic than a practical pursuit; its great triumphs are in geometry and the theory of proportions. The harmonious order of things is in the world according to the Greek view. It is there whether it is perceived or not. This assumption is widespread in mythic thought, and to the Greeks goes credit for expressing it with such rigor that it could become the basis for early Greek science. "Comeliness" is another matter. It requires a judgment on the part of the observer and a motive, real or imputed, on the part of the creator. Greek science assumes that creation is beautiful as well as orderly; the proper response to it is aesthetic as well as intellectual. In the Theogony, Hesiod (8th C. b.c.) imagines that creation is pervaded by the music of the nine muses, the daughters of Mnemosyne: "Unwearying flows the sweet sound from their lips, and the house of their father Zeus the loud- thunderer is glad at the lily-like voice of the goddesses as it spreads abroad, and the peaks of snowy Olympus resound, and the homes of the immor- tals." The world is music, and creation a dance. In the sixth century b.c. Pythagoras of Samos discovered the rela- tion between harmony and number- according to legend, after hearing the tones produced by a blacksmith's hammers of different weights. His discovery convinced him that number is the foundation of the comely order of the world and that harmony is its corollary. The natural order is simultaneously functional and beautiful, and its basis is number. This</page><page sequence="5">О. В. HARDISON, JR. 373 conclusion remained central in later Greek scientific thought. It may, in fact, have hampered the development of Greek science by encouraging its interest in elegant demonstration at the expense of calculation. The motto over the doors of Plato's academy was Medeis ageometretos eisito -"Let no one ignorant of geometry enter." In The Republic (Book VII) Socrates discusses the education of his guardians. The central disciplines are arithmetic, geometry, harmony, and dialectic. Number is fundamental. It is the key to the rational understanding of the real: These sparks that paint the sky, since they are decorations on a visible surface, we must consider the first and most exact of visible things, but we must recognize that they fall far short of the truth- the movements, namely- of real slowness and real speed in true numbers and true figures. . . . These can be appre- hended by reason and thought, not by sight. Christian apologists could (and did) discover Pythagorean notes in the Old Testament. Of wisdom Proverbs says, "When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth." In Book VII of Milton's Paradise Lost (1667) this becomes: ... in his hand He took the golden Compasses, prepared In God's Eternal store, to circumscribe This Universe, and all created things: One foot he centered, and the other turn'd Round through the vast profundity obscure, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds, This be thy just Circumference, О world. And the Pythagorean note rings in the work of the great Renaissance astronomer Johannes Kepler (1 571-1630). Early in his career Kepler concluded that the distances between the planets can be determined by assuming they are the distances that would be produced by inscribing the five regular solids, beginning with the tetrahedron, inside of each other. He wrote in Mysterium Cosmographicum (1596), It is my intention, Reader, to demonstrate that the Highest and Most Good Creator in the creation of this mobile world and the arrangement of the heavens had his eye on those five regular bodies [i.e. solids] which have been celebrated from the time of Pythagoras and Plato down to our own day; and that to their nature He accommodated the number of the heavenly spheres, their proportions, and the system of their motions.</page><page sequence="6">374 THE GEORGIA REVIEW The Pythagorean scientist is drawn to the world as much by love of its endlessly surprising and beautiful patterns as by the desire for knowledge. He is a connoisseur as well as an observer of facts. If he does not create beauty, he discovers it and shares it with others. In a discussion of Faraday's experiments with electricity, J. B. S. Haldane touches the Pythagorean chord: As a result of Faraday's work you are able to listen to a wireless. But more than that, as a result of Faraday's work, scientifically educated men and women have an altogether richer view of the world. For them, apparently empty space is full of the most intri- cate and beautiful patterns. So Faraday gave the world not only fresh wealth but fresh beauty. in The search of Pythagorean science for elegant geometric and mathe- matical forms behind the appearances of the visible world stands in strik- ing contrast to the emphasis on observation and experiment that is central to the Baconian tradition. Baconian science finds reality directly ahead in the visible world. Since it is extremely difficult to see things as they are, Baconian science is a never-ending contest with human weakness. Bacon remarks in T he Advancement of Learning ( 1 605 ) : The mind of man is far from the nature of a clear and equal glass, wherein the beams of things should reflect according to their true incidence; nay, it is rather like an enchanted glass, full of superstition and imposture, if it be not delivered and reduced. And later, commenting on imagination: Imagination doth raise and erect the Minde, by submitting the shewes of things to the desires of the Mind, whereas reason doth buckle and bow the Mind unto the Nature of things. And we see by these insinuations and congruities with man's Nature and pleasure, joined also with the agreement and consort [imagina- tion] hath with Musické, it both had access and estimation in rude times and barbarous Regions, where other learning stoode excluded. There is a strong note of asceticism in Bacon. Man is not the supreme work of Creation, the measure of all things and the image of God, as he is, for example, in Pico della Mirandola's famous essay, On the Dignity of Man. Instead he is an upstart crow in a world utterly indifferent to his existence. His mind is an enchanted glass- a distorting mirror- that must</page><page sequence="7">О. В. H ARDISON, JR. 375 be "delivered and reduced"- that is, mortified- if it is to find truth. Since Bacon had no knowledge of sophisticated scientific instruments, he understood reality as "things" seen from a middle distance by the naked eye. An ideal Baconian dictionary of reality would be a collection of pic- tures, one for each thing that exists in the world. It follows that the ideal language is a language of nouns with one noun for each thing so that men can speak "so many things almost in an equal number of words." The dictionary for this sort of language would be a list of nouns corresponding to the pictures contained in the ideal picture-dictionary. However, when pictures get inside the mind they are made into what they are not. Since this position involves a hostile critique of that which exists inside the mind- namely, that which makes people human- it is in some sense a hostile critique of humanity. The first paragraph of Charles Dickens' Hard Times ( 1 854) is a tribute to the influence of Baconian asceticism two cen- turies after Bacon's death: Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of rea- soning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any ser- vice to them. It is a pity that Bacon was such a successful propagandist because his concept of science simply does not square with the facts he was so fond of. Placed beside Descartes's Discours de la Méthode pour Bien Conduire sa Raison et Chercher la Vérité dans les Sciences (1637) the Novum Organum is clearly more rhetoric than science. Moreover, there is a touch of Pythagorean wonder in Bacon in spite of himself. But it is the distrust of mind, not the wonder, that made Bacon a hero of science in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly in the sciences that depended more on observation and classification than on mathematics: geography, geology, biology, anatomy. IV Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species (1859) is the culmination and- for many Victorians- the vindication of the Baconian tradition in science. Darwin explicitly recognizes his debt to Bacon in his Autobiography (1876): "I worked on the true Baconian principles, and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale." The book brings together twenty years of painstaking, minutely detailed observation ranging over</page><page sequence="8">37Ó THE GEORGIA REVIEW the whole spectrum of organic life. Like Bacon, Darwin made little use of mathematics, although he had attempted (unsuccessfully) to deepen his mathematical knowledge while at Cambridge. Nor was Darwin the sort of scientist whose observations depended on instruments. Although his four-volume study of Cirripedia (barnacles) uses microscopy fre- quently, most of his other works could have been- and were- written almost entirely on the basis of direct observation. As soon as it was published, The Origin of Species was recognized as one of those books that changes history. Its reception was partly a tribute to the overwhelming wealth of detail it offers in support of its theory and partly an instance of powder waiting for a spark. Jean Baptiste Lamarck had proposed a generally evolutionary theory of biology in the Histoire naturelle des animaux (1815), which Darwin says in his Auto- biography was an influence on him. Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology (1832), with its evidence of the immense span of the record of fossil life, was indispensable to Darwin. Lyell's contribution was of special value to Darwin in his work on the Galapagos Islands. It showed that the varia- tions he observed among animals of the same species must have occurred within a relatively short span of geologic time. Another source, and the immediate occasion for the publication of The Origin of Species , was the work of Alfred Russell Wallace. In 1858 Wallace sent Darwin his essay "On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type." Darwin admits in the Autobiography that this essay "contained exactly the same theory as mine," though it lacks the luxuriance of Dar- win's supporting observations. Again according to the Autobiography , it was his reading of Malthus that suggested to Darwin, around 1838, that all species are locked in a remorseless struggle for survival, although the concept of natural selection may also owe something to Edward Blyth. Darwin denies in the Autobiography that evolution was "in the air" before The Origin of Species was published: "What I believe was strictly true is that innumerable well-observed facts were stored in the minds of naturalists ready to take their proper place as soon as any theory which would receive them was sufficiently explained." In any case The Origin of Species was an immediate sensation. By ignoring religious dogma and wishful thinking Darwin was able to buckle and bow his mind to the nature of things and produce the sort of powerful, overarching concept that reveals coherence in a vast area of experience that had previously seemed chaotic. A modern reader can see a kinship between Darwin's passionate</page><page sequence="9">О. В. HARDISON, JR. 377 interest in all things living- beginning with his undergraduate hobby of collecting beetles- and the outburst of nature poetry that occurred in the Romantic period. Darwin was unaware of this affinity. In the Autobi- ography he says that "up to the age of thirty, or beyond it, poetry of many kinds, such as the works of Milton, Gray, Byron, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley . . . gave me the greatest pleasure. . . . But now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry." His Journal of the Voyage of the Beagle is filled with appreciative comments about tropical landscape, but he remarks that natural scenery "does not cause me the exquisite delight which it formerly did." He plays the role of Baconian ascetic collecting "without any theory . . . facts on a wholesale scale." His mind, he says (again in the Autobiography) has become "a kind of machine for grinding laws out of large collections of facts." The idea that the mind is a machine that grinds facts echoes Bacon's injunction to "buckle and bow" the mind to nature. The same asceticism is evident in Darwin's disparaging comments on his literary style. He believed he was writing dry scientific prose for other scientists, and John Ruskin, among others, agreed. He was astounded, gratified, and a little frightened by his popular success. No one can read Darwin today without recognizing that he was wrong about his style. As Stanley Edgar Hyman observes in The Tangled Bank (1962), both The Voyage of the Beagle and The Origin of Species are filled with passages which, whatever Darwin may have thought of them, are of a high literary order. The writing is effective precisely because it does not strain for the gingerbread opulence fashionable in mid-Victorian English prose. It has a freedom from pretense, a quality of authority, as moving as the natural descriptions of Wordsworth's The Prelude because it stems from direct contact with the web of relationships that comprise nature. Darwin was, indeed, a good Baconian; but instead of revealing a mind bowed to nature, his prose reveals a mind that has sur- rendered to the kaleidoscope of life around it. No passage is more reveal- ing in this respect than the concluding pararaph of The Origin of Species, in which Darwin describes a natural scene, . . . clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and . . . these elaborately con- structed forms, so different from each other, and so dependent upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us Thus, from the war of nature, from</page><page sequence="10">378 THE GEORGIA REVIEW famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. Thus, in addition to being a Baconian scientist- or because of being that kind of scientist- Darwin is one of the first poets of the actual. The closest visual parallels to his prose are the drawings of Audubon, but his writing is also related to the photographs of Matthew Brady, the histories of Ranke and Burckhardt, and the novels of Balzac and George Eliot and Turgenev. The following passage from the discussion of the struggle for existence in Chapter III of The Origin of Species illustrates Darwin's technique: How have all these exquisite adaptions of one part of the organi- zation to another part, and to the conditions of life, and of one organic being to another been perfected? We see these beautiful coadaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and the mistle- toe; and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or the feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentle breeze; in short we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world. Exquisite , perfected , beautiful , humblest , plumed, gentle. The world de- scribed by these adjectives is not cold, alien, or indifferent. It is a work of art. Nor is Darwin's the dispassionate, dry prose of a technical manual. As in a painting the parts mentioned are harmoniously related to each other- "coadaptation" is Darwin's word- and the music of the prose ob- jectifies the harmony. There is no detectable difference here between a hypothetical figure labeled "scientific observer" and a literary artist com- menting on experience. The language invites the reader to share experi- ence as well as to understand it. Exquisite , beautiful , and gentle orient him emotionally at the same time that his attention is focused on the objects that give rise to the emotion: mistletoe, parasite, water beetle, plumed seed. The passage flatly contradicts Darwin's statement in the Autobiog- raphy that his artistic sensitivity had atrophied by the time he was thirty. That he thought it had shows only that he believed with his contempo- raries that science is science and art is art. The problem is in his psyche, not his prose. The tradition that science should be dispassionate and practical, that it is a kind of servitude to nature, prevented him from un- derstanding what he was, in fact, doing.</page><page sequence="11">О. В. HARDISON, JR. 379 A more complex example of Darwin's artistry can be found in the "summary" of Chapter III. The passage is a sustained meditation on a single image. The image- the Tree of Life- is mythic, an archetype fa- miliar from Genesis and also from Egyptian, Buddhist, Greek, and other sources. In mythology, the Tree of Life connects the underworld and the heavens. It is the axis on which the spheres turn and the path along which creatures from the invisible world visit and take leave of earth. It is an ever-green symbol of virility, bearing fruit in winter. It is the wood of the Cross on which God dies, and the wood reborn that announces the return of life by sending out new branches in the spring. All of this symbolism is familiar from Frazer's Golden Bough , Jung's Symbols of Transforma- tion, and other studies of mythic imagery. Behind it is what Rudolf Otto calls, in The Idea of the Holy , the terrifying and fascinating mys- tery: mystérium tremendum et fascinans. Still, it is interesting to find a scientist, particularly a preeminent Victorian scientist, using an overtly mythic image. The emphasis of the passage on branching limbs is a visual image of evolution, but at the same time it is a remarkably full elaboration of the archetype: The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and those produced during former years may represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have at all times overmastered other species in the great battle for life. . . . From the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off; and all these fallen branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives, and which are known to us only in a fossile state. As we here and there see a thin, straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favored and is still alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the Ornitho- rhynchus or Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life, and which has appar- ently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station. As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches</page><page sequence="12">380 THE GEORGIA REVIEW the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever- branching and beautiful ramifications. Darwin's music here is stately and somber. The central image is estab- lished at the beginning: a great tree green at the top but filled with dead branches beneath the crown. The passage becomes an elegy for all the orders of life that have perished since the tree began. Words suggesting death crowd the sentences: overtopped , kill , the great battle for life, de- cayed, dropped off, fallen, no living representative, straggling branch, fatal competition. As the passage moves toward its conclusion, a change, a kind of reversal, can be felt. Words suggesting life become more fre- quent: alive, life, saved, fresh buds , vigorous. The final sentence restates the central paradox in a contrast between universal desolation- "dead and broken branches [filling] the crust of the earth"- and images of eternal fertility- "ever-branching and beautiful ramifications." The idea that science reveals truth is central to the Darwinian mo- ment. Once revealed, truth can be generalized, and the truths discovered by Darwin were applied almost immediately to sociology and political science. Herbert Spencer had coined the phrase "survival of the fittest" in 1852 in an article entitled "A Theory of Population." Buttressed by the prestige of The Origin of Species, the concept of the survival of the fittest was used to justify laissez-faire capitalism, a use brilliantly chronicled in Richard Hofstadter's Social Darwinism in American Thought (1955). Andrew Carnegie remarked in 1900 that "a struggle is inevitable [in society] and it is a question of the survival of the fittest." John D. Rocke- feller seconded the opinion: "The growth of a large business is merely the survival of the fittest." Capitalism enables the strong to survive while the weak are destroyed. Socialism, conversely, protects the weak and frustrates the strong. Marx turned over the coin: socialism is a later and therefore a higher product of evolution than bourgeois capitalism. Being superior, it will replace capitalism as surely as warmblooded mammals replaced dinosaurs. Darwin influenced cultural thought at a deep level, which is to say that he changed not only the way reality was managed but the way it was understood. The writing of history became evolutionary- so much so that historians often assumed an evolutionary model and tailored their facts to fit. The histories of political systems, national economies, tech- nologies, machinery, literary genres, philosophical systems, and even styles of dress were presented as examples of evolution- meaning examples</page><page sequence="13">О. В. HARDISON, JR. 38 1 of progress from simple to complex, usually interpreted to mean from good to better. And, of course, Darwin deeply influenced progressive religion. Adam Sedgwick, professor of geology at Cambridge, began the long history of attacks on Darwin in the name of religion when he wrote in "Objections to Mr. Darwin's Theory of the Origin of Species," published anonymously in i860: "I cannot conclude without expressing my detes- tation of the theory, because of its unflinching materialism." Perhaps be- cause of such attacks, Darwin added the phrase "by the Creator" to his conclusion of the second edition of T he Origin of Species (i860): "There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved." Whether this fully repre- sents Darwin's personal view of religion lies outside the scope of the present discussion. Probably it did not. At any rate the notion that God is revealed in evolution remains powerfully attractive today both to bi- ologists and, as shown by Teilhard de Char din's The Phenomenon of Man (written in 1938 and published in 1955), to those attempting to formulate a scientific theology. Many of the applications of Darwin's ideas were patently strained from the beginning, while time revealed the inadequacies of others. "So- cial Darwinism" is studied in history classes today but is no longer a viable political creed. Most fundamental, however, is the fact that by the middle of the twentieth century Baconian empiricism was no longer adequate to the idea of nature that science had developed. Einstein, Heisenberg, and Godei made it clear that nature and the mind are involved in each other and are not separate empires. An objective world that can be "ob- served" and "understood" if only the imagination can be held in check simply does not exist. Facts are not observations "collected ... on a whole- sale scale." They are knots in a net. v D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860-1948) was everything in biology that Darwin was not. On Growth and Form ( 1 9 1 7 ) is an attempt to place biology on a mathematical foundation. To do this Thompson felt he had to deny not only Darwin's conclusions about evolution, but also the</page><page sequence="14">382 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Baconian methodology of The Origin of Species. In the light of the ex- plosive development of biology since World War II, On Growth and Form has come to seem less significant than it did thirty years ago. It remains, however, a significant illustration of a moment in scientific thought halfway between the Victorian period and the late twentieth century. In his introduction, after quoting Kant's assertion that chemistry is "a science but not a science" because it is not based on mathematics, Thompson comments that "numerical precision is the very soul of science, and its attainment affords the best, perhaps the only criterion of the truth of theories and the correctness of experiments." Admitting the complexity of life processes, he adds, "My sole purpose is to correlate with mathe- matical statement and physical law certain of the simpler outward phe- nomena of organic growth and structure or form." A common criticism of Bacon's philosophy of science, as well as Darwin's, is that it ignores mathematics. This is true. Bacon published grandiose schemes for the reform of knowledge, but Galileo established the basis for the mathematical analysis of acceleration, and Descartes laid the foundations of analytic geometry. To move from Darwin to Thomp- son is to move from the poetry of things to the poetry of the numbers that underlie things. It is to move, in other words, from things visible to things invisible, which is to say away from Bacon and toward Pythagoras. Karl Gauss, James Clerk Maxwell, Ernest Rutherford, Josiah Gibbs, Jean Baptiste Fourier, Hermann Helmholtz, Georg Cantor, and a host of other brilliant nineteenth-century figures shared Thompson's appre- ciation of the power of mathematics. All were far more accomplished mathematicians. Thompson seldom goes beyond elementary mathematical concepts, noting for example that for objects of equal density, mass in- creases as the cube of linear dimension rather than in proportion to it. The observation is commonplace, almost trivial. However, Thompson's application is not. He concludes that the length of the limbs of land ani- mals of the same species will, in general, increase in proportion to the cube root of their body weight. This leads to calculations of the probable lengths of the legs of birds of the same species but different weights. Insects breathe by diffusion of oxygen through capillary tubes extending from shell to bloodstream. Their maximum size is fixed by the fact that if they become very large their breathing apparatus ceases to function. Load-bearing horizontals must be supported, and the support struc- tures tend to be mirror images of the stresses to which the structures are</page><page sequence="15">О. В. HARDISON, JR. 383 subject- hence the shapes of dinosaur skeletons and the shape of the human femur. When circles are close-packed they deform, if flexible, into hexagons- hence honeycombs. Spheres tend to deform when close-packed into rhombic dodecahedra or complex 14-hedra- hence two common con- figurations of close-packed tissue cells. The equiangular spiral (so-called by Descartes) increases in volume without changing shape- hence the Chambered Nautilus. The shape of fish is determined by the flow of water. Streamlining- the term was apparently invented by Thompson- reduces turbulence to a minimum and thus maximizes swimming efficiency. Bones and body shapes that appear unrelated on casual inspection can be seen to be similar when they are drawn on graphs and the graphs are systemati- cally distorted. Thompson multiplies his examples luxuriantly, especially in the re- vised and enlarged edition of On Growth and Form (1942). Perhaps the most remarkable fact about them is their mathematical simplicity. Thomp- son does not need or want complex examples. He is demonstrating a point: the relevance of mathematics to biology. The simpler and clearer the examples, the more convincing the demonstration; Thompson shares the fondness of all scientists in the Pythagorean tradition for grand sim- plicities. The application of mathematics to life may not seem innovative to- day, but Thompson clearly felt in 191 7 that it was a bold, even a risky, venture. It seems to violate an unspoken feeling that life is beyond quan- tification: "To treat the living body as a mechanism was repugnant, and seemed even ludicrous, to Pascal; and Goethe, lover of nature as he was, ruled mathematics out of place in natural history." When the zoologist meets a simple geometrical shape in a living organism, "he is prone of old habit to believe that after all, it is something more than a spiral or a sphere, and that in this 'something more' there lies what neither mathematics nor physics can explain. ... In short, he is deeply reluctant to compare the living with the dead." Rather remarkably, Thompson anticipates for biology what Ferdi- nand de Saussure claimed in his Cours de linguistique générale, published posthumously in 191 5, only two years before the first edition of On Growth and Form. Saussure observed that in spite of the delights of etymology, a language exists all at the same time or it does not exist at all. It is "synchronic"- a web of simultaneous relationships- rather than "dia- chronic"- extended across history, no matter how fascinating history may be as a subject. So it is in Thompson's biology. The search of evo-</page><page sequence="16">384 THE GEORGIA REVIEW lutionary biologists for "the blood relationships of things living and the pedigrees of things dead and gone," must give way to the analysis of "fundamental properties" and "unchanging laws of matter and energy." Diachrony must yield, in life as in language, to synchrony. On Growth and Form might have been an unreadable collection of formulas, graphs, temperature and pressure tables, stress measurements, and the like. It is not. The mathematical regularities that Thompson dis- covered throughout the living world seemed astonishing and delightful to him. G. E. Hutchinson's "In Memoriam, D' Arey Thompson" (1948) states: "What he wrote brings home to the scientific mind perhaps better than any work of any other writer, what it means to be civilized." P. B. Medawar, a fellow biologist, wrote in a postscript to a biography of Thompson (1958) that On Growth and Form is "beyond comparison the finest work of literature in all the annals of science ... in the English tongue" and is "the equal of anything of Pater's." Buckminster Fuller knew Thompson's work and was influenced by it. There is a section in On Growth and Form entitled "A Parenthetic Note on Geodesies": Ful- ler's domes owe something of their lacy and organic intricacy to the im- pression the book made on him when he read it in the 192 o's. Thompson's "Epilogue" is a majestic expression of the mixture of analysis and religious wonder that pervades his text: That I am no skilled mathematician I have had little need to confess. I am "advanced in these enquiries no farther than the threshold"; but something of the use and beauty of mathematics I think I am able to understand. I know that in the study of ma- terial things, number, order and position are the threefold clue to exact knowledge; that these three, in the mathematician's hands, furnish the "first outlines for a sketch of the Universe"; that by square and circle we are helped, like Emile Verhaeren's carpen- ter, to conceive "Les lois indubitables et fécondes Qui sont la règle et la clarté du monde." For the harmony of the world is made manifest in Form and Number, and the heart and soul and all the poetry of Natural Philosophy are embodied in the concept of mathematical beauty. A greater than Verhaeren had this in mind when he told of "the golden compasses prepared In Goďs eternal store." A greater than Milton had magnified the theme and glorified Him "that sitteth upon the circle of the earth," saying: He hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a mea- sure</page><page sequence="17">Force Fields in "Streamlining" (from D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's Growth and Form)</page><page sequence="18">38 б THE GEORGIA REVIEW Not only the movements of the heavenly host must be deter- mined by observation and elucidated by mathematics, but what- soever else can be expressed by number and defined by natural law. This is the teaching of Plato and Pythagoras, and the mes- sage of Greek wisdom to mankind. So the living and the dead, things animate and inanimate, we dwellers in the world and the world wherein we dwell ... are bound alike by physical and mathematical law. "Conterminous with space and coeval with time is the kingdom of Mathematics; within this range her do- minion is supreme. . . ." This is a summary of the main thesis of On Growth and Form and a hymn to the comely beauty of the world. Thompson quotes poetry- Verhaeren and Milton and Genesis- to find words adequate to his vision, but his own language is equally poetic. His nature is not a collection of things seen from the middle distance in the manner of Darwin but of innumerable phenomena- the skeletons of diatoms and the cells of honey- combs and the shells of the nautilus and the skulls of horses- reduced to the forms of dodecahedron and hexagon and logarithmic spiral and truss. His chapter on comparative morphology uses regular distortions of Car- tesian graphs to reveal hidden similarities between forms: The mathematical definition of "form" has a quality of precision which was quite lacking in our earlier stage of mere descrip- tion. . . . We are brought by means of it in touch with Galileo's aphorism (as old as Plato, as old as Pythagoras, as old perhaps as the wisdom of the Egyptians) that "the Book of Nature is writ- ten in characters of Geometry." Thompson believed in 191 7 that he had embarked on a journey even more radical than that of physics. Mathematics had been a part of physics since Pythagoras, but the application of mathematics to life was, Thomp- son felt, something new. By extending its empire to living organisms- and we have already seen that he was uneasy about the step- Thompson made mathematics a universal category. There is nothing left to hold out against it. A revolution has been won. Darwin's view of things is saturated with human motives. Life is made possible only by death; the cost of the beautiful and ever-ramifying branches on the Tree of Life is the graveyard of species that litter the earth around its base. To regard the struggle for existence as tragic, however, is logical nonsense and a prime example of the pathetic fallacy- and so, in spite of Darwin's allegiance to Bacon, an instance of what Bacon considered the besetting human error: "Submitting the shewes of things</page><page sequence="19">О. В. HARDISON, JR. 387 to the desires of the Minde." The million plumed seeds that die in order that one may live have no sense of their own tragedy. It is the human observer who imposes this sense on the order of things. To call death- even the death of seeds- tragic is to call life a blessing. But to say that the death of seeds is, purely and simply, the death of seeds is to suggest that life and death have equal meaning or no meaning at all. They are phases of matter, sides of a coin, a yin and a yang. The mythic quality of Dar- win's description of the struggle for survival suggests strongly that he was psychologically unable to admit this possibility. Mathematics has no place for the pathetic fallacy. When viewed in terms of the category of mathematics, the world retains its dazzling beauty but is not tragic. Instead of clothing the nonhuman world with human sentiments, mathematics seems to do the reverse. It seems to strip away the claim of life to being somehow unique by treating it as con- tinuous with the inorganic world. A sphere is a sphere whether it is ma- terialized in a raindrop or a human tear. A honeycomb is not the inspired product of Pythagorean insects or the result of millions of years of subtle "coadaptations," but simply the shape that flexible circles assume when close-packed. "We dwellers in the world and the world wherein we dwell," Thompson wrote, "are bound alike by physical and mathemati- cal law." The word seems in the preceding paragraph is used advisedly be- cause the moment in the development of scientific culture represented by D'Arcy Thompson confronts us with a paradox. Mathematics is not "in the world" in the sense that Bacon's facts and Audubon's birds and Dar- win's water beetles are in the world. It may be in the mind of God. If so, mathematics is the true ground of reality. On the other hand, if God does not exist- or if God exists but is not interested in mathematics- then mathematics is a product of the human mind. It is not the ground of the real but a mask imposed on the real by man. The same paradox is evident in another aspect of modern science, which has moved away from observations at the middle distance, where things look like things, to observations of the very small and the very dis- tant; and the instruments it uses to observe- including purely representa- tional instruments like Cartesian graphs- often yield images quite different from those given by the five senses. The effect of seeing nature from these perspectives is apparently to dehumanize it. Things no longer look like things. The images that the instruments produce have more kinship with each other than with what they "are." An enlarged microphotograph of</page><page sequence="20">388 THE GEORGIA REVIEW a cancer cell looks like an abstract painting, or, to the untrained and un- wary eye, much like a microphotograph of crystals embedded in an alloy or like geological formations in radar images made from a satellite. An infrared view of a distant landscape may glow like an impressionist can- vas; an ultraviolet view will be different but equally lovely. All of these versions of nature are "real." In fact, from Thompson's point of view they are more real than nature observed from a middle distance because they show structure. More important, the images produced by the instruments are not inhuman but radically human. The instruments were made by men, not by God or nature, and it is only through their mediation that the images can appear. The nature they reveal is not an alien other, whether beautiful or terrible or both. It is, rather, a projection of the human spirit- a show- ing forth of something that requires the cooperation of the spirit to achieve presentness. At the same time, the image of nature in the sense of things seen from middle distance has disappeared. The contrast between Darwin and Thompson shows that as the image dissolves, the sense of tragedy- of human drama with human consequences- is replaced by generalized ap- preciation of the beauty of form. Thompson's poetry is more rarefied than Darwin's. The sense of detail, the concern for the particularity of each object, that is so powerful in The Origin of Species is transformed into delight in the discovery of mathematical regularities replicated across the whole range of life. Inevitably Thompson is forced by his assumptions into direct con- frontation with Darwin. Kant showed that time is a human motive projected into nature- another instance of anthropomorphism. Darwin understood evolution as something that happens in time, an historical process. Evolution has a direction which tends to be "up," an ascent from simple to complex, which means from good to better. Millions die but the fittest survive. This is the consolation that finally allows Darwin to come to terms with the struggle for survival. As mathematics eliminates the last vestiges of anthropomorphic, mythological, and tragic sentiment from nature, it eliminates the concept of the direction of time. Thompson's rejection of the search of evolu- tionary biology for ancestors is clearly a move in that direction. Function, not "pedigree," determines survival. Some things work and some things do not. Simple is not good and complex is not better. For Thompson, evolutionary time has no arrow:</page><page sequence="21">О. В. HARDISON, JR. 389 In the order of physical and mathematical complexity there is no question of the sequence of historic time. The forces that bring about the sphere, the cylinder or the ellipsoid are the same yesterday and to-morrow. A snow-crystal is the same today as when the first snows fell. The physical forces which mould the forms of Orbulina , of Astrorhiza , of Lagena or of Nodosaria to-day were still the same ... in that yesterday which we call the Cretaceous epoch; or, for aught we know, throughout all that duration of time which is marked, but not measured, by the geo- logical record. This is much more than a quibble. It is a challenge to the generally ac- cepted understanding of evolution. Having rejected evolution, Thompson also rejects any progress that Darwinian theory might imply: In the end and upshot, it seems to me by no means certain . . . that the concept of continuous historical evolution must neces- sarily, or may safely and legitimately, be employed. That things not only alter but improve is an article of faith, and the boldest of evolutionary conceptions. How far it were true were very hard to say; but I for one imagine that a pterodactyl flew no less well than does an albatross, and that the Old Red Sandstone fishes swam as well and as easily as the fishes of our own seas. The invisible web of forces that shapes natural organisms has no history because it is eternal and no home because it is universal. The living and the dead, the dwellers in the world and the world in which they dwell, are to the mathematician equal. Those who find evidence of a divine plan in the numbers of living forms may do so; this is the path of Pythagorean mystics and religiously inclined modern scientists. VI The problem of the world seen from different perspectives is both fa- miliar and profound. To someone wearing dark glasses the world looks dark, but it is not necessarily so. Take off the sunglasses and the world is flooded with intolerable light. One kind of mathematics reveals one kind of pattern; another reveals another. The darkness of the world becomes yellow with yellow lenses, blue with blue. Nietzsche expresses this concept in the metaphor of masks. In Greek tragedy plots were created when Thespis imposed the mask of a hero on the face of the god who stood at the center of the liturgy of Dionysus. Mapped on a Mercator projection, the world looks different from the</page><page sequence="22">390 THE GEORGIA REVIEW same world on a Dymaxion projection. The two mapping systems are masks imposed on the world by men. In Masks of the Universe ( 1 984) Edward Harrison suggests that all of the cosmologies of history are so many masks covering a face that will never be seen. The world is always somewhere beyond its masks; no map can use more than a tiny sampling of the information the world continuously offers. This is a blessing. Too much information would render the world unintelligible. But is the result of fitting bits and pieces together any less arbitrary than a Mercator projection? What guarantees its authority? The elimination of absolutes from human knowledge does not imply an end of human response to nature. It places man in the country he creates with his own mind. In this country he is surrounded by brilliant, fantastic, wildly distorted images of himself. Hence the third moment of modern science, the authentically modern moment, the moment of reality as game. Wallace Stevens calls the games the mind plays with the world "necessary fictions." The mind cannot get along with them, but it cannot get along without them either. They organize experience just as religion, mythology, and tradition organize it. They are the preconditions of knowledge, perhaps of consciousness. Between the publication of New- ton's Principia Mathematica in 1687 and Darwin's The Origin of Species in 1859, man believed science would present him with truth. This is a fantasy. Science has challenged religion and mythology and tradition- and people still lament the challenge- but it no longer promises to replace them with truth, only with necessary fictions. This morning the world may be a rhombic dodecahedron; by noon it may well be a Möbius strip. Friedrich Schiller, poet and longtime friend of Goethe, popularized the game metaphor at the end of the eighteenth century in his Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man (1795). He traced the human urge to create to the Spieltrieb , the play impulse. Play and work are both rigorous because both require effort and both have strict rules. However, we are forced to work in order to survive. People who play games are often intensely serious, but they play for fun. Rules are essential because with- out them there would be no games. But they are only rules. They are retained as long as they are useful or entertaining. When things get boring the chess pieces are put back in the drawer and the table is set for poker; or, as in the case of the rule in football governing downfield interference with a pass receiver, the rules can be changed to make things more exciting. In an absolute sense one game is as good as another. Once</page><page sequence="23">О. В. HARDISON, JR. 39I liberated from the idea that only one game is possible, the mind changes shapes as easily as Proteus. To move from D'Arcy Thompson's majestic and classical medita- tion on the comely order of things to the world of modern physics and mathematics is to move from a science that assumes the existence of abso- lutes to a science that is provisional, relative, paradoxical, playful, ebul- lient. It is a science liberated from the need to take itself seriously, hence a science that is a game or a series of games played with whatever is be- yond it. Some games are entirely rational. Others intentionally involve chance, having a random element that can overturn the most careful strategies. Here a great modern poem should be invoked because it iden- tifies the contemporary moment as a game of the random variety. The poem itself wavers between moments of play and moments when it takes itself seriously. This is not surprising considering its date: 1897. It is ex- actly contemporary with the beginning of those massive shifts in per- spective that lead to modern culture. It is thus both observation and prophecy. Un Coup de Dés is Stéphane Mallarmé's last poem. He lived to see it printed in the magazine Cosmopolis but not to see it printed according to his instructions. The most striking feature of the poem when correctly printed is that each "page" occupies a conventional double page. The division between the left and right leaves of the double page is part of the poem's visual message. Another visual feature is the use of several sizes and styles of type. The largest type defines the largest concept: UN COUP DE DÉS JAMAIS N'ABOLIRA LE HASARD-" A throw of the dice will never eliminate chance." Since Mallarmé taught English, is it possible that hasard also has the connotation of "danger"? Because of its visual effects the poem has the qualities of a painting or of the poésie concrète of the 1950's. It is spread out in the Pléiade edition across eleven double pages. It begins solidly on the right (the "dexter" or favored side), wanders to a balanced left-right format, then drifts almost entirely to the left (sinister) leaf. At midpoint it wavers between right and left, but gradually the bias to the right is reasserted, becoming unambiguous on the last two pages. In spite of this positive quality the poem ends as it began, with the image of a game of dice: " Toute Pensée émet un Coup de Dés." There is a beginning, middle, and end to the poem, but is anybody there? Just barely. The poet is a modern Odysseus afloat on an ocean of</page><page sequence="24">392 THE GEORGIA REVIEW potential silence, symbolized by the blankness of the pages. The silence is the lack of a language to name the world in which the poet finds himself. He is thus also an Adam who remains dumb as the animals pass in review. Being human, he must rebel against the silence. In a region of perfect silence, without up or down, any assertion will be arbitrary, hence ran- dom, hence "a throw of the dice." The dice are thrown. A provisional order is established. Minimalist though it is, the achievement brings satis- faction. The poet begins to move across and down the page. He en- counters a shipwreck. In spite of it he presses forward. Every word is an affirmation, a passage over an abyss, a victory over silence. Toward the end a constellation appears: the Bear ( Ursa Major). Is it a landmark, a divine sign, or a chance array of stars given human significance by superstition? Whatever the answer, the constellation is "froide ď oubli et de désuétude The poet struggles past it toward the epic goal, the end of the poem. He reaches the end exhausted but pre- paring to triumph- brillant et méditant- only to learn in the last line the lesson of the poem's beginning. It is time to begin the game again: T oute Pensée émet un Coup de Dés. The play of Un Coup de Dés is serious. The play of modem science is also serious; but its games are so exhilarating, and the rules often so strange, that the play becomes overtly playful. The playfulness spills over into mathematical and logical puzzles and into language that is intentionally paradoxical, whimsical, and absurd. Do you have trouble remembering pi to twenty-one digits? Try the following bit of mathe- matical slapstick, in which the number of letters in each word gives you a digit: How I wish I could remember pl. Eureka! cried the great inventor. Christmas pudding, Christmas pie Is at the problem's very center. The archetype of all such logical slapstick is the work of Charles Dodgson, who wrote on non-Euclidian geometries and symbolic logic and is also known for the fiction he wrote under the name of Lewis Carroll. In The Annotated Alice (i960) Martin Gardner suggests that the Alice books are games for grown-ups: "It is only because adults- scientists and mathematicians in particular- continue to relish the ALICE books that they are assured of immortality." If modern scientists keep the Alice books alive, they do so because Dodgson's oscillation between symbolic</page><page sequence="25">О. В. HARDISON, JR. 393 logic and bizarre fictional games anticipates a central theme of modern science. Gardner remarks: The last level of metaphor in ALICE is this: that life, viewed rationally and without illusion, appears to be a nonsense tale told by an idiot Mathematician. At the heart of things science finds only a mad, never-ending quadrille of Mock Turtle Waves and Gryphon Particles. For a moment the waves and particles dance in grotesque, inconceivably complex patterns capable of reflect- ing on their own absurdity. We all live slapstick lives, under an inexplicable sentence of death. . . . This is a long way from Thompson's noble numbers, but it nicely ex- plains the relation between the madcap playfulness of Through the Look- ing Glass and the playfulness of science. Had he lived a few more years, D'Arcy Thompson would probably have been delighted to learn that a double helix is at the center of life and that life's infinitely complex forms are mediated by sequences of four bases. Physics and astronomy, however, refuse to be as neat as biology. In its quest for simplifications, particle physics constantly finds new com- plexities. Quarks come in pluses and minuses, quarks and antiquarks. The twelve varieties of quark are distinguished by four flavors, three colors, three anticolors, and varying degrees of strangeness. The colors are red, green, and blue, and the anticolors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. One of the flavors has charm; hence the charmion. The name "quark" was taken by Murray Geli-Mann, a California physicist, from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. Quarks are arranged in an eightfold way, a phrase borrowed from Zen. They are combined by particles called gluons because they glue quarks together. The gluons have color and cause either infrared or ultraviolet slavery. Quarks have to exist in order for the equations of nature to work out. If they did not exist, nature would be inconceivable. But no quark has ever been observed and none is likely to be, because the theory that makes quarks essential to the concept of nature includes within its proof the subproof that quarks will change into something else if sufficient energy is applied to get them out in the open where they can be observed. According to Dr. Yochiro Nambu, quarks are contained either on a string that cannot be broken or in bags that are impossible to penetrate. Whence it follows: Theories of quark confinement suggest that all quarks may be permanently inaccessible and invisible. The very success of the</page><page sequence="26">394 THE GEORGIA REVIEW quark model leads us back to the question of the reality of quarks. If a particle cannot be isolated and observed, even in theory, how will we ever be able to know that it exists? To move from the incredibly small to the inconceivably large, if the "big bang" theory is correct, the universe may simply be itself, but because there is so much of it, accounting for where it came from is difficult. Big bang theoreticians have not been able to push their history of the universe earlier than 10 to the - 43rd second of its existence. In the beginning, a trillionth of a second ( 1 о to the - 1 2 ) is crowded with events; later, billions of years pass and nothing much happens. The inflationary theory of creation agrees fully with the big bang theory about what happened after the first 10 to the -30th second, but what happened before that makes all the difference. The inflationary theory assumes there was first a pseudovacuum in which a real vacuum formed. The pseudovacuum is far larger than the universe but forever beyond its horizon. Meanwhile, the universe took shape in the pseudo- vacuum much like a hole in a Swiss cheese or a bubble in a glass of ginger ale. It is one of many- perhaps infinite- bubble universes. All this happened prior to about 10 to the -30th second of creation, and one drawback of the inflationary universe is that if it is true, no con- sequences of anything existing before the inflation can ever be observed because they have all been obliterated. On the other hand, the inflationary model has a splendid virtue. It shows that everything that exists is exactly canceled out by something else that exists. The sum is breathtakingly elegant but in a way that might have made Thompson unhappy: it is zero. As Alan Guth and Paul Steinhardt, the primary inventors of the theory, explain, everything is derived from nothing (or almost nothing) : "In this view the universe would originate as a quantum fluctuation from abso- lutely nothing." They conclude that the theory "offers what is apparently the first plausible scientific explanation for the creation of essentially all the matter and energy in the observable universe." Among other things, this promises to settle a longstanding theological feud: "From nothing all things come"- ел: nihil ovinia fiunt. To many of its citizens the world of quarks and black holes is an affront. Humanity seems to have leaked out of it. To others it is a playful world- a world of games, though some of the games are deadly serious, and of necessary fictions, though some of the fictions are more necessary than others. The choice of fictions may be decided by a throw of the dice, but perhaps not. The question is probably being asked in terms of a past</page><page sequence="27">О. В. HARDISON, JR. 395 that no longer exists, rather than a present that may not exist but is as good a bet as any if one is throwing dice. Gauss and Lobachevski began investigating non-Euclidian geome- tries early in the nineteenth century, and Riemann placed the enterprise firmly on its modern course. The results stirred bitter controversy within as well as outside of the mathematical fraternity because they challenged the ideal of an eternal order of things beyond nature. In effect, they threat- ened to make geometry into a game. Geometry and play are wonderfully interwoven in Benoit Mandel- brot's The Fractal Geometry of Natur e ( 1 982 ) . Like D' Arey Thompson, whom he cites, Mandelbrot writes for the general reader as well as the specialist. Although his ideas are complex, he presents them in nontech- nical as well as technical form. His mathematics, however, is closer to the surrealistic fantasies of André Breton or René Magrite than Thompson's eternal Pythagorean forms. For Mandelbrot "Euclid" is a bad word, synonymous with a cold and unnatural formalism. "Why," he asks, "is geometry often described as 'cold' and 'dry'? One reason lies in its in- ability to describe the shape of a cloud, a mountain, a coastline, a tree. Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line." Part of the playfulness of Fractal Geometry comes from its unpre- dictability. Like Mallarmé, Mandelbrot enjoys throwing dice. Although randomness is not essential to the mathematical concept of fractals, he regularly introduces it into his constructions, because randomness makes them more "like" clouds and mountains and less like triangles and spheres. His rejection of Euclid carries forward the revolt begun in the late nineteenth century, when geometers began to confront shapes that refused to behave in the well-brought-up manner of Euclid's circles and parabolas. Traditionalists called these shapes "pathological" and "terrifying," and "a gallery of monsters." However, Mandelbrot argues that the shapes are more, not less, natural than Euclid's regular forms. F. J. Dyson, a reviewer of Fractal Geometry , suggests the movement to study them was "kin to the cubist paintings and atonal music that were upsetting established standards of taste in art at about the same time." Mandelbrot, however, rejects Cubism and related movements, including the Bauhaus: "A Mies van der Rohe building is a scalebound throwback to Euclid." As these references to painting and architecture suggest, fractal ge- ometry is closely related to art. Mandelbrot calls it a "new geometric art" and argues that "because it came in through an effort to imitate Nature in</page><page sequence="28">396 THE GEORGIA REVIEW order to guess its laws, it may very well be that fractal art is readily accepted because it is not truly unfamiliar." Pictures are integral to Man- delbrot's text. They are part of his proof that fractal geometry is natural. They are often surrealistic, but even the most bizarre of them teases the mind with its familiarity. "In the theory of fractals," writes Mandelbrot, " 'to see is to believe.' . . . The reader . . . is . . . advised to browse through my picture book. This essay was designed to help make its contents ac- cessible in various degrees to a wide range of readers." One of Mandelbrot's most striking constructions is pure surrealism. It is a "self-squared dragon," and it is the ancestor of a large and exotic line of computer monsters, some in four rather than three dimensions. Alan Norton, a colleague of Mandelbrot at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, describes photographing the four-dimensional self- squared dragons that float up from his computer screen as "throwing my camera out there in the dark, taking snapshots." To emphasize the famil- iarity of fractals, Mandelbrot includes traditional paintings as well as mathematical constructions: God the Creator from a twelfth-century Bible manuscript, the waters of Noah's flood by Leonardo da Vinci, and "Great Wave" by Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849). To get an idea of what a fractal is, consider a line that squiggles around on a page- a doodle you made, maybe, while talking on the tele- phone. In traditional geometry your squiggly line has one dimension- length. The surface on which it is written has two dimensions, length and width, and the space you occupy while you doodle has three dimensions. The conventional dimension of a point is 0 and of a line 1. The number 1 is an integer (as are 2 and 3), in contrast to a number like 1.5, which is a fraction. If your phone call lasts a long time, your doodle will eventually cover most of the page. If your phone conversation lasted long enough it would cover the page, and its dimension would change from 1 to 2. In order to describe the tendency of a squiggly line to become a surface, Mandelbrot says that it has a fractional dimension. That dimension might be something like 1.5, and the line is known as a fractal. A fractal dimen- sion is also called a "Hausdorff dimension" after Felix Hausdorff, who developed the idea in 191 9. Lines with dimensions of 1.5 probably seem as bizarre as they can get. But are they? We like to pretend we live in a tidy world full of circles and triangles and right angles. However, anybody who has tried to make a picture frame knows that right angles are the exception rather than the</page><page sequence="29">Self-Squared Dragon (adapted from Mandelbrot's The Fractal Geometry of Nature)</page><page sequence="30">398 THE GEORGIA REVIEW rule in the real world. Mandelbrot calls the world of lines and planes and right angles Euclidian because Euclid is constantly using it in his geome- try. Mandelbrot considers such a world to be a fantasy, and an unnatural one at that: "Many patterns of Nature are so irregular and fragmented that compared with Euclid- a term used in this work to denote all of standard geometry- Nature exhibits not simply a higher degree but an altogether different level of complexity." Take coastlines. Mandelbrot's fifth chapter introduces the subject with the question, "How long is the coast of Britain?" A good question, which, as Mandelbrot notes, was first asked by the mathematician Lewis Richardson. Mandelbrot points out that if you look at a map made at a scale of one hundred miles to an inch, the coast is obviously not smooth. It goes in and out in bays and promontories and estuaries and capes. You include these when you measure it. If you use a map drawn at a scale of ten miles to an inch, new bays suddenly open up and new promontories jut out from the sides of bays. When you measure these and add them to your first total, the coast gets longer. It gets longer still at a mile to an inch- and so on until you are crawling around on your hands and knees measuring the distances around small rocks. If you decide to use a micro- scope, you will find yourself measuring the irregularities on the surface of each rock and . . . Enough! Mandelbrot has been faithful to nature, but where has the coast of Britain gone? Is there a coast? Is the problem serious or absurd? It is certainly playful, like the logical puzzles in Through the Looking Glass. It also has serious practical implications. Mandelbrot compares the lengths of the border between Spain and Portugal in different atlases. The Portuguese atlas shows the border as twenty percent longer than the Spanish atlas. Should Spain break off diplomatic relations with Portugal? No. Both atlases are correct. The Spanish surveyors based their measure- ments on a larger unit of distance than the Portuguese and therefore measured fewer squiggles. To decide how to measure the coast of Britain (or the border between Spain and Portugal) Mandelbrot creates a fractal line that behaves like a coastline. In other words, he makes a mathematical model. He begins with a regular shape- an equilateral triangle. He then introduces a regular deformity into each of its three sides. The result is a twelve-sided figure shaped like the Star of David. Next he repeats the operation for each of the twelve sides, creating a figure with forty-eight sides, and so on until the changes are so small the eye cannot follow them.</page><page sequence="31">Koch Triangles (from Benoit В. Mandelbrot's The Fractal Geometry of Nature ]</page><page sequence="32">400 THE GEORGIA REVIEW The figure never stays stili because it has no bottom. Every time you try to measure it you discover that at the next step down it has squig- gles you left out in your last measurement. It is not a coastline, but it is like a coastline. It is called a Koch triangle and has a fractal dimension of about 1.26. Clouds, riverbanks, coastlines, tree branches, the branchings of ever- smaller air passages in the lungs, natural drainage systems, commodity prices, tree bark, word frequencies, turbulence in fluids, stars in the sky, and galaxy clusters in deep space are all wondrously, dizzily, and irre- ducibly fractal. Or, to put the idea more correctly, all seem to be fractal. Something very interesting and wonderful happened while Mandelbrot was measur- ing the coast of Britain. He was not observing nature but devising ways to use mathematics to generate things like nature. His shapes are necessary fictions. Evidently, he is an artist or poet as much as a scientist- a creator rather than an observer. The test of his models is "likeness" to their origi- nals. The test is often disarmingly direct. Does the picture look like the thing represented? Since the pictures become more "like" the things being pictured if they are irregular, randomness is an essential part of Mandelbrot's art, if not of his mathematics. When randomness is part of the generating process Mandelbrot's squiggles are no longer entirely predictable. The squiggles at one level of magnification are different from those at another, although at all levels the squiggles may have a family resemblance. When the irregular squig- gles enclose areas, they look uncannily like coastlines of islands or con- tinents or shorelines of lakes. When they are three-dimensional, they look like natural landscapes. The resemblance is so striking that fractal geome- try is routinely used to produce landscapes of unknown worlds by movie studios such as Lucasfilm. The likeness carries over into phenomena like eddy currents and turbulence. Mandelbrot would argue that the presence of so much likeness is a strong indication that randomness is part of the deep structure of nature. "Seeing is believing." To create a fractal shape you have to add squiggles to squiggles to squiggles. In other words, you have to perform the same operation over and over again. In theory the operation can go on forever. The squiggles can be enlarged repeatedly until the line covers the sky. By the same token, they can be diminished repeatedly until they resemble strands of DNA. You can regard the result with amusement or awe. Mandelbrot does</page><page sequence="33">О. В. H ARDI SON, JR. 4OI both. Amusement is evident when he quotes from Jonathan Swift's "On Poetry: A Rhapsody" (1733): So Naťralists observe, a Flea Hath smaller Fleas that on him prey, And these have smaller Fleas to bite 'em, And so proceed ad infinitum. Awe is suggested when he quotes from Immanuel Kant's Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens (1755): It is natural ... to regard the [nebulous] stars as being . . . systems of many stars. [They] are just universes and, so to speak, Milky Ways. ... It might further be conjectured that these higher universes are not without relation to one another, and that by this mutual relationship they constitute again a still more immense system . . . which, perhaps ... is yet again but one mem- ber in a new combination. We see the first members of a pro- gressive relationship of worlds and systems; and the first part of this infinite progression enables us already to recognize what must be conjectured of the whole. There is no end but an abyss . . . without bound. In practice there are limits, called "cutoffs," that stop things short of the abyss. Hence Mandelbrot's description of observing a ball of thread: A ball of 10 cm diameter made of a thick thread of 1 mm diameter possesses (in latent fashion) several distinct effective dimensions. To an observer placed far away, the ball appears as a zero-dimensional figure: a point. ... As seen from a distance of 10 cm resolution, the ball of thread is a three-dimensional figure. At 10 mm, it is a mass of one-dimensional threads. At о л mm, each thread becomes a column and the whole becomes a three- dimensional figure again. At 0.0 1 mm, each column dissolves into fibers, and the ball becomes one-dimensional, and so on, with the dimension crossing over repeatedly from one value to another. When the ball is represented by an infinite number of atomlike points, it becomes zero-dimensional [because a point is said to have 0 dimensions] . The observing of the ball of thread is segmented by the cutoffs. Part of the transition from one phase to another is subjective- the observer chooses the scale- but part derives from nature. In the example of the ball of thread nature is "grainy"- that is, different systems appear at different scales. How long is the coast of Britain? What are you after? Are you a</page><page sequence="34">402 THE GEORGIA REVIEW space shuttle or a cruise ship captain or a fisherman in a rowboat? Mandel- brot remarks, "In one manner or another, the concept of geographic length is not as inoffensive as it seems. It is not entirely 'objective.' The observer inevitably intervenes in its definition." This comment recalls Heisenberg's concept of indeterminacy, and Mandelbrot emphasizes the parallel: "The notion that a numerical result should depend on the rela- tion of object to observer is in the spirit of physics in this century and is an illustration of it." In Heisenberg, indeterminacy is decently submerged in the spaces between (or among) electrons. In Mandelbrot it is swimming boldly along on the surface like some Loch Ness Monster or self -squared dragon circumnavigating the coast of Britain. Banished forever from the fractal world is the notion that nature is a collection of "things" seen from a middle distance. The fractal world is so strange that Mandelbrot has devised a new poetry to name its citizens. He obviously enjoys the task; it is another kind of game. The word fractal is part of his poetry. It is derived from Latin frangere, "to break," "to create irregular fragments." Other coin- ages are dust , curd , and whey-, grainy structures, hydra-like structures, ramified structures, tiled surfaces, and pertiled surfaces (in which collec- tions of little tiles make big tiles like the little tiles of which they are made); pimply, pocky, wrinkled, and wispy surfaces-, self-squared drag- ons, monkeys' trees , Minkowski sausages, flattened flowers, skewed webs, random slices of Swiss cheese, and chains and squigs. But the ultimate proof of any pertiled pudding is its eating: The Fractal Geometry of Nature offers picture after picture of breathtaking playfulness and as- tonishing likenesses- sometimes to themselves and sometimes to nature. vii The science of the late twentieth century asks man to understand himself in the light of his own reason detached from history, geography, and nature, and also from myth, religion, tradition, the idols of the tribe, and the dogmas of the fathers. It offers likenesses of nature, not nature, and it suggests further that nature is a partially subjective concept. Culture is an artifact and probably a game, and what happens in it is the result of human rather than divine will. Objectifying this understanding of things requires new languages. Mallarmé's poet is locked in an heroic struggle against silence. The Cubist</page><page sequence="35">О. В. HARDISON, JR. 403 painters take a more playful view of things, but they too recognize that the artist is responsible for creating new languages to match the new cul- ture. The same spirit of play is revealed in modern science in the naming of quarks and self-squared dragons. The names are playful because play is an essential quality of that which is being named. If science is a human creation, this review of modern science has caught the mind in the very act of swallowing up the world. The steps are nicely defined by the figures of Charles Darwin, D'Arcy Thompson, and Benoit Mandelbrot. They take us from a nature that is alien and into which human motives are poured, to a nature that is number (but number authenticated by an absolute order), to an imitation of nature by means of number. Darwin's world is mythic. Mandelbrot's is pure fiction, which means that it is entirely human. Games are human inventions. A throw of the dice will never eliminate chance, but it keeps the games interesting.</page></plain_text>
