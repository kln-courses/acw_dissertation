<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY IN HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION "In the little which it takes to satisfy us we can measure our loss."1 In 1837 an eighteen-year old maker of verse epigrams wrote of Hegel: Kant and Fichte gladly roam the ether, Searching for a far off land, While I seek only thoroughly to understand What I found in the street.2 Later in his life Marx would forget in his critiques of Hegel's "Gedankenwelt" that Hegel had devoted his whole philosophy to under standing what he found around him. Hegel saw that "eternal bliss and eternal damnation are words not used in polite society."3 Since the Enlightenment "our time is distinguished by its knowledge of an infinite number of things but knows nothing of God."4 Because it was the Enlightenment that deprived religion of enlightenment Hegel thought that only philosophy could restore to religion a teaching. In what follows, I wish to portray and interpret Hegel's philosophy of religion as it is to be found in his developed thought, rather than as it appeared in his Early Theological Writings or in the Phenomenology of Mind. It is with Hegel's system that I am concerned, and Hegel is notoriously the philosopher of "The System," yet before Wittgenstein said that "philosophy leaves everything as it is" Hegel wrote that "philosophy in troduces nothing new."5 The difference is that Hegel was convinced that only systematic, speculative reason could explain everything as it is, and Hegel was as much at home "in the ether" as in the street. Because it is his philosophy Hegel's philosophy of religion dwells "in the ether of thought in which every thing finite disappears" and, because it is his philosophy of religion, it is equally concerned with "the [religious] subject . . . with his needs, conditions, sins, and in general in accordance with his entire empirical, temporal character."6 Although Hegel thought that "nothing else is worth the effort except God and his explication"7 he was not, as Spinoza has been described (Hegel</page><page sequence="2">HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 199 thought Spinoza an atheist),8 a "God-intoxicated" philosopher. While he taught that philosophy "is not wisdom of the world, but knowledge of the not-worldly"9 Hegel does not conceive of the "not-worldly" as another world. "God is over the world, the world is outside man and only the spirit (Geist) is in man."10 Thus Kant but not Hegel. God is not over nature, but where spirit and nature are in unity. "Philosophy of nature cancels (au fhebt) the separation of nature and spirit and preserves (gew?hrt) for spirit its es sence in nature."11 Since nature develops into spirit the progress of spirit through history is also the progress of nature: the end of nature is to end itself.12 Philosophy of nature ends in philosophy of history. Religion must be understood historically because: "Every thing spiritual comes to us in a finite form ... as historically spiritual."13 Feuerbach believed that in opposing subject and object, knower and known, mind and nature Hegel completed the modern break with nature begun by Descartes.14 But it was just that break that Hegel tried to heal, and in doing so to put religion on its feet. Only God's power was exhibited in the first five days of creation; his wisdom is exhibited in history because what man produces is higher, more spiritual and more godly than nature. There are not two spirits, a human and a divine spirit, and spirit is not "beyond the stars, outside the world . . . God is present, omnipresent as spirit in every thing spiritual."15 It should now be apparent how right Karl L?with is when he contrasts Hegel's philosophy of religion to the "harmlessness of what is taught in American universities and theological seminaries as 'philosophy of religion.' "16 Hegel absorbs religion and theology into his philosophy which provides a new, if isolated and unrecognized, priesthood.17 For Hegel there is no conflict between reason and religion, but only a conflict between reason and faith. Kierkegaard, "the knight of faith" very shrewdly recognized the enemy in "the absolute professor," as he called Hegel. What makes Hegel so formidable is that his philosophy of religion employs his entire system from logic to his philosophy of art. Because his en tire philosophy is a philosophy of spirit Hegel is not an enemy outside the walls. From within he shows that the claim of the church (read: religion) to the spiritual as its exclusive property is a usurpation: science, knowledge in general, and the state are in fact more spiritual.18 We cannot proceed further without understanding the fundamental concepts of Hegel's philosophy. Highly, not to say bafflingly, abstract as it is, Hegel regards his philosophy as the understanding of the concrete, of the actually existing world: "If the true [Das Wahre] is abstract it is untrue."19 God's nature like every nature must reveal itself and develop; God is pure spirit but "spirit</page><page sequence="3">200 EDWARD BLACK which does not appear [erscheint] is not." Since essence "must appear ... es sence is neither behind nor beyond the appearance." The Ding an Sich is what appears, it is not the opposite of appearance.20 God's revelation of himself is his appearance in both nature and history. The greatness of Kant was, as Hegel puts it, to show that the mind does not have ideas as a man has a coat. The transcendental unity of consciousness means that the objectiveness of the object requires the activity of the subject. An object of knowledge becomes itself only when it is grasped by the mind. Hegel restores the Aristotelian theory that in being known the form of an ob ject is simultaneously in the knower and the known: to know an object is to have it in mind and not merely an idea of it; in being known the object becomes true to itself.21 A thing reaches its truth when it corresponds to its notion (Begriff), its essence. Hegel regards it as a logical prejudice that it is judgments that are true or false, they are rather correct or incorrect. "True" in Hegel's use means "true to" not "true of." A thing is true, truly that kind of thing, when it is what it should be, so that a sick body, for example, is un true. "True" means the same as "good" and "false" the same as "bad."22 Taken in its immediacy, as it just happens to be because of its relations to other things, as it is determined by things outside itself, a thing possesses Dasein. Merely by being in time and space everything is related to everything else; when these relations change a thing is changed without changing itself. Its change is not Reflexion, change mediated by essence. Nonliving things, which interact only mechanically or chemically, are not self-determined, not free. Only living, organic change is self-mediated change, or the appearing of essence. Being-outside-self (Ausser einander sein), determination by others ?being unfree?is what Hegel means by nature.23 "When one begins to philosophize one must first be a Spinozist," Hegel believed, but then one must go beyond Spinoza because "... everything depends upon apprehending and expressing the true [das Wahre] not only as substance but just as much as subject."24 A nonliving thing is an object for another object; it is unfree because it is not the cause of itself, does not develop. The living subject produces itself out of inorganic nature (or by kill ing another subject), negating "the other" which, as what it needs to satisfy its needs, is its own negation. By negating its negation, by cancelling its in completeness, by subjecting "the other" to itself, it maintains itself as a sub ject. Life is "the enormous power of the negative."25 A living thing negates its own states and is identical with its process of becoming; it is the unity of itself and its negative. In life inner and outer, cause and effect, ends and means, subjectivity and objectivity are the same: life produces life, life is both an end and a means; a subject acts upon itself as</page><page sequence="4">HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 201 an object.26 While the full development of these ideas is in the Logic and the Encyclopedia, Hegel repeats them extensively in the Philosophy of Religion, because only living things can be spiritual, and religion is the recognition of spirit by spirit as something higher than nature. Although Marx seldom used "spirit" except in a derogatory way, when he complains in the first of the Theses On Feuerbach that all previous materialists have understood things as objects, but not as activity, not subjectively, he shows himself the pupil of Hegel.27 Because man is spirit man has religion, for spirit exists only for spirit.28 Philosophy of nature shows how nature "passes over" into spirit. Although "spirit" survives in common English only in a few cases, such as "team spirit," Geist is the most common?and important?concept in Hegel's philosophy. The opposite of spirit is not nature, but matter because the es sence of matter is gravity, or determination by another.29 Hegel does not say that man is a spirit, he says that man is spirit: man is spirit because he over comes the force of matter. Tight-rope walking is a spiritual occupation. Although Christianity is the absolute, true, most spiritual religion, Hegel tells us: "By the Greeks we feel immediately at home, for here we are in the region of spirit."30 Spirit is the negation of externality, of determination by "the other," and "all activities of spirit are nothing but different ways of return from ex ternality to innerness."31 Spirit is what is not merely in relation and, therefore, spirit is what elevates itself above nature. By itself in "the other," spirit is free: it is in itself and with itself.32 Where Kant finds freedom only in morality, Hegel finds it in every activity of life, even in digestion in which "the other" is turned into self.33 The innerness (Insichgehen) of Socrates and Luther is the end of a spiritual development which begins in the simplest process of life. In the higher, more spiritual activity of self-consciousness, subject and object are identical; since animals lack self-consciousness, Hegel can make the remarkable statement that because he knows he is an animal man ceases to be an animal.34 An animal is not conscious of "the other" in general, but only of "the other" it needs; only man has the universal for an object. In an inorganic body the universal "is sunk" in particularity. If, for example, an object is colored it must have some particular color and lack others, and therefore it is restricted, determined. But perceiving a color does not color so that an animal can perceive many colors, and can perceive contraries without becom ing contrary to itself. If it can perceive one color an animal can perceive others until, finally, if it is self-conscious, it can form the concept of color, a universal. Since color is not a color, the universal is a free product of thought.</page><page sequence="5">202 EDWARD BLACK Thought is a free activity through which I unite myself with the world.35 What is most characteristic of Hegel's philosophy is this: "The drive ... for knowledge, from the lowest to the highest rung of philosophical insight proceeds from the effort to cancel unfreedom [ Unfreiheit] and to appropriate the world in ideas and thought."36 Religion is part of this drive but is not on the highest rung, which is philosophy. We commonly oppose the spiritual to the physical; what is not physically possible, or what is not explainable in physical terms, we call spiritual. Hegel is aware of this and gives as an example the ability of people in their sleep, or under hypnosis, to be aware of events happening thousands of miles away. But, he objects, such knowledge if it existed would be merely knowledge of the same sensible particulars which we could observe if present at the scene. More spiritual is knowledge of the universal which cannot be observed, such as Kepler's discovery of the laws of motion of the planets.37 Hegel's attitude toward the "supernatural" shows itself in what he has to say about miracles. A miracle is the result of a spirit controlling nature, but spirit has no need of miracles because spirit is itself a miracle, an exception to the laws of nature. Life itself is an exception to the mechanical and chemical laws of nature. Whatever is spiritual does not require external witness because spirit is superior to everything external.38 Because of the manner in which Hegel understands nature and spirit he must regard nature religions, the worship of nature, as the lowest, least spiritual form of religion. "The unity of man with nature" to Hegel's ears is no more than "a popular, pleasant-sounding phrase" which "rightly un derstood means the unity of man with his own nature" which is "free spirituality."39 The lowest form of nature religion is magic, which is the attempt to exercise immediate power over nature. Primitive man is not in terested in the universal; he is not interested in the sun or in the earth, but in eclipses and earthquakes. But magic is a religion because it is a recognition of spirit's desire to be free of nature.40 If magic is the attempt to exercise immediate power over nature, work is actual, mediated, intelligent power over nature.41 We have already here in primitive conditions a conflict between religious and secular power which will culminate in medieval Europe in what Hegel calls an "infinite falsehood," the complete subordination of the secular to "spiritual" power, which he describes as "the most disgusting and revolting spectacle that was ever witnessed."42 This state of affairs, described in the strongest language that Hegel ever used, begins in the Bible. Nature religion is immediate religion, but it is the nature of spirit to op pose itself to nature, to immediacy, and so religion has a history. Biblical</page><page sequence="6">HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 203 religion is the opposite of nature religion. The Jewish religion is the religion of sublimity (Erhabenheit) in which God is known as knowing spirit, pure spirit, since as the author of nature, He cannot have a natural form. In the Bi ble "for the first time nature and the human form lie undeified and prosaic before us."43 The sublimity of spirit is nature's degradation: nature is reduced to the prosaic relation of external things to be understood by the categories of the understanding, always for Hegel inferior to reason.44 In The Philosophy of Religion Hegel treats Jewish religion extensively while almost completely neglecting Egyptian religion, but in The Philosophy of History, where he praises Egyptian science and art, where Egypt poses the riddle to be solved by Greece, Egypt is on a higher spiritual level than Judaea. Nature was liberated by the Jews but not understood: the Jews lacked science and culture.45 From Hegel's point of view, which is always that of his philosophy, the most important story in the Bible is the Fall. Since spirit exists through op position even God must encounter opposition; because it is His work the world cannot oppose God: only spirit can oppose spirit. As finite spirit man opposes God as infinite spirit. Philosophically interpreted, the story of the Fall contains a contradiction: God forbids man to know good and evil, but spirit is spirit only through such knowledge. If Adam had not been free to dis obey God's command he could not have obeyed it either, but free obedience requires knowledge of good and evil. "The serpent says that Adam will become like God," but, Hegel observes, God confirms the serpent for "it is this knowledge which constitutes Godlikeness."46 The Fall is not a fall from innocence, and Adam was not innocent, since he could obey or disobey. Man's natural goodness means for Hegel that he is potentially spirit; when man is merely natural, when he follows his impulses, he is evil. If the Fall is really an elevation the punishment is a reward: "... the greatness of man is to eat by the sweat of his brow."47 When Marx extolled work as the means by which man adds nature to his natural powers "in spite of the Bible" and when he describes the wonders of science and industry as "the open book of man's powers" he is speaking in one?but only in one?of Hegel's tongues.48 In Hegel's philosophical retelling of the Fall, man is elevated to knowledge and to work. Animals live in harmony with nature and do not work, but disruption (Entzweiung) is contained in the nature of man: man knows nature without nature knowing him. His knowledge of nature enables man to treat the whole of nature as his inorganic nature. Only man, the think ing animal, is aware of "the other in general."49 In what Hegel calls "the practical process" an object is made to conform to a subject. Even in animals, Hegel finds something akin to an instinct to work; in building a nest an</page><page sequence="7">204 EDWARD BLACK animal makes use of natural properties of sticks and leaves, while mediating its desires by postponing their satisfaction in order to create a more perma nent means of satisfaction.50 Power over nature takes the two forms of theory and practice. In prac tice we make our ideas objective by working upon the external world to make it conform to our ideas, by idealizing it. Work provides a way?a more limited way than Marx imagined?of being at home in the world. In changing the world, man also changes himself and becomes "the fate of the particular."51 As Marx puts it: "Work produces a subject for the object as well as an object for the subject."52 For Feuerbach, Marx and Nietzsche religion is the power of the powerless. Hegel has a very different estimate of religion because he does not regard religion as ineffective practice; religion is theoretical, and for Hegel, theory is unquestionably superior to practice. Animal's bodies are constructed for practice but even man's body is con structed for theory.53 Through the fact that he works, man shows that he has recognized the externality of the world, its objectivity. By understanding how natural properties are dependent on each other, man "arms himself " and "attacks" nature on "its weak side."54 It is not only Hegel's language which foreshadows Marx, who will boast that unaccomodated nature is reserved for Sunday walks or exists only in Australian coral reefs of recent origin.55 In the demand for miracles and miracle workers, religion comes into conflict with the understanding of the world, with worldliness; but worldliness is itself spiritual. Hegel, in The Philosophy of Religion as much as in The Philosophy of Right, takes an unequivocal stand with regard to the conflict between religion (not merely the church) and state, divine wisdom and worldly wisdom, holiness and morality. The lilies of the field which neither toil nor spin do not impress Hegel. It is in accordance with his spiritual nature, for man to take thought of the morrow and want (Not, which also means necessity) is "more rational here than such religious views." In opposition to renunciation of the world "the demands of freedom ... enter into conflict with the religious principles which require renunciation." Religion is in conflict with the principle of modern times, a principle confirmed by philosophy, the principle that man is by his nature free: a "principle of infinite worth" opposes the religion of the infinite.56 Unworldliness is a spiritual duty only if the world is unspiritual. There is also a worldly calling. "Man makes religion, religion does not make.men . . . This state, this society produce religion, an inverted world consciousness, because they are an inverted world . . . [Religion] is the fan</page><page sequence="8">HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 205 tastic realization of the human essence, because the human essence possesses no true reality ... Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world ... the opium of the people . . ." Some of the terms are Hegel's but the voice is unmistakably that of Marx?on the first page of his Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right. To Marx the critique of religion had already been completed. He had only to draw the conclusions, as he does in the fourth of the Theses on Feuerbach: "Once, e.g., the earthly family has been discovered to be the secret of the holy family the former must now itself be theoretically and practically eliminated." We can grant that man makes religion without granting that religion does not also make men. Where Marx sees only illusion and an inverted world, Hegel sees a mirror which magnifies and sanctifies. Marx's demand to eliminate the image and its original is as unreasonable as the resentment of the good burghers who posed for Rembrandt's Night Watch that they had been placed in the shadows. Hegel finds a definition of a people in their religion: "The concept of God constitutes the general basis of a people's character," and concludes that "freedom can exist only where individuality is recognized ... in the divine being."57 Since there are not two spirits, since spirit is the same in man and gods, religion is not an inverted but a glorified world. It is the essence of spirit to make and to know itself, to be process and product; the human is recognized by the divine as its "other", and man recognizes God as "the other" who is also himself. "Humanity is itself in God . . . man knows that the human is a moment in God himself and only in rela tion to God is he free."58 If there is one religion which clearly escapes Marx's condemnation of be ing "the spiritual aroma of real suffering" it is Greek religion. The Greeks are the most human people and their religion is the religion of humanity; in their religion there is nothing unintelligible, so that trust in their gods is trust in themselves. In honoring their gods the Greeks honor themselves and in honoring themselves they honor the gods.59 By elevating God so far above it the religion of sublimity lowers the world. A miracle is an insult to nature; in a miracle God manifests himself in some individual thing in opposition to its nature. "The true miracle in nature," Hegel reasons, "is the manifestation of spirit ... the spirit of man and his consciousness of reason in nature."60 Anaxagoras appeared to Aristotle as a sober man among drunkards when he claimed that mind governs the world. Hegel's most famous and most mis understood principle, that "Whatever is real is rational and whatever is rational is real" is Hegel's route back to Anaxagoras.61 In Greek religion "the other" of God, the world, has godliness in it: the Greeks wondered at the</page><page sequence="9">206 EDWARD BLACK natural in nature. Oedipus solved the riddle of the sphinx. For Hegel this means that "the great Egyptian symbol" with the body of an animal and the head of man stands for "the inner being of nature is thought which has its ex istence only in human consciousness."62 Hegel's admiration for everything Greek makes it difficult to see how spirit could advance beyond the Greeks. Hegel has nothing but contempt for Roman art and Roman religion. But history advances by opposition so that a lower stage may prepare the way for a still higher stage. Medieval Catholicism was terminated by a return to art and science, but art and science on a higher plane than Greek art and science. Medieval piety preferred "a piece of stone or wood or a bad picture" to a Raphael Madonna because piety found in beauty something alien and opposed to it. The Raphael was an ex pression of a higher development of spirit than the church.63 Spirit grows by what it overcomes and what it overcomes is itself. Hegel denies Schiller's famous saying: "When the gods were more human men were more divine." The Greek gods were not human enough; they were anthropomorphic but not anthropopathic; a god with parents and an occupation, with human passions awaited Christianity. The right of individuals to be recognized as individuals requires that God become an individual. The beauty of the Greeks (as in the Greek profile) con sisted in the unity of the individual with the universal; among the Greeks the satisfaction of personal needs was the privilege of slaves.64 Since the Greek ideal was the coincidence of the individual and the universal neither could develop further in the Greek world. History develops through conflict and the Greeks were harmonious; being satisfied they could disappear but they could not change. Spirit is what it knows itself to be; self-consciousness develops out of self-conflict and since the Greek was not his own enemy he was not self-conscious. The Greek was happy and that was his misfortune. The limits of the Greek spirit are the limits of sculpture, the typically Greek art and the only art which, in Hegel's opinion, the Greeks perfected.65 The Greeks were unable to develop the inner world of spirit through conflict with the outer world of nature; they were too beautiful to be good and too natural to be spiritual. Christianity was bred in the prosaic conditions of the Roman Empire where "the Greek heart is broken and it is all over with the naturalness of spirit."66 Nowhere is Hegel more systematically ambiguous in his treatment of religion than in his understanding of Christianity, the absolute religion. In his contempt for what remained of Christianity in the nineteenth century Nietzsche made a very acute observation: "... Pascal thinks ... that in view of the fearful possibility that it is true, it is in the highest degree prudent to be</page><page sequence="10">HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 207 a Christian. Today one finds, as a sign of how much Christianity has declined in fearfulness, that other attempt to justify it by saying that even ifit were an error, one might yet have during one's life the great advantage and enjoyment of this error . . ,"67 There is nothing fearful about Hegel's version of Christianity. Hegel certainly did not believe in Zeus and Apollo but he did believe in the effects of believing in them, and he frequently seems to be more interested in the results of Christian faith in "the court of judgement" of world-history than he is in Christianity. In spite of his avowal that he was?and would remain?a Lutheran, Hegel's Christianity is not Luther's. Could Luther have said that the advance of spirit since the Reformation has been in the building of the secular realm, that nothing is higher or more sacred than morality and justice in the state, and that this is the reconciliation of God and the world? 68 The man who in Prussia discovered the "cunning of reason" had reason to be cunning. "What Luther initiated as faith in feeling and in the witness of spirit, is precisely what spirit, since became more mature, has striven to apprehend in the concept in order to be free and so to find itself in the world as it exists today."69 Is it likely that Luther would have agreed with any part of this or even have understood what Hegel understood by "feeling," "spirit" and "concept"? For Hegel religion is philosophy for the unphilosophical.70 Philosophy and religion may have the same object, as Hegel so often claims, but it is harder to see how they can have the same con tent, if faith without reason is a part of religion's content. Feuerbach saw in Hegel's philosophy religion in disguise?Hegel saw in religion philosophy in disguise. Why does Hegel call Christianity the absolute religion? Because of all religions, it most resembles his own absolute philosophy. By the Absolute Hegel means the Idea, the truth as a subject which develops concretely in and through itself. By Idea Hegel does not mean a thought; the Idea is the unity of the notion and objectivity, of the ideal which is also real. "The Idea is itself the dialectic."71 The Idea is what all religion attempts to understand as God. In his fascinating course of lectures on Hegel, Alexandre Koj?ve considers Hegel's philosophy the ultimate form of atheism. But Koj?ve is not merely in terpreting Hegel, he explicity corrects him: Koj?ve limits the dialectic to history and excludes it from nature.72 The result is intriguing to Koj?ve, who is a philosopher in his own right, but it emasculates Hegel. When Hegel calls philosophy Weltweisheit he means by the world nature as well as history: world history includes natural history. This is not the place to defend Hegel's philosophy of nature,73 but by illustrating it with one or two instances I hope to make it clear that no change in physics (Hegel himself preferred Kepler to Newton) can require its aban</page><page sequence="11">208 EDWARD BLACK donment. Hegel assigns to Kant the honor of having revived philosophy of nature which, while differing from empirical physics, presupposes its dis coveries. Its purpose is not to describe nature, as physics does, but to know what nature is: its object is the idea of nature. Philosophy of nature, for Hegel, shows how nature "passes over" into spirit. Hegel considers it more rational to explain the lower, the less developed, in terms of the higher, the more developed; the higher is the truth (in Hegel's sense of "truth") of the lower and its power over it.74 Nature is the Idea in the form of "otherness", of externality in space and time. Bodies mechanically and chemically interrelated form a system, e.g., the solar system, but are not themselves a system. Substance is power, but as mechanical or chemical force an inorganic substance is not power over itself, and therefore, is not free, not the means to itself as its own end.75 But in inorganic nature there are degrees of freedom, degrees of progress toward organic nature. Gravity is determination by another body in space, but specific gravity and cohesion, are moves toward individuality, toward being for-self, toward liberation from the other. In elasticity Hegel finds this promise kept for the first time: an impression from the outside is negated and a body acts to preserve itself.76 The dialectic of reconcilation between self and other which is begun in nature is continued in religion. The religions which Hegel considers are progressive stages in the reconciliation of spirit with itself, of finite and in finite spirit, of the human and the divine. In religion the "reaching out toward a beyond is my doing, ... my yearning, my willing, my striving" so that in separation I am still "by myself."77 To know is to know something else which, nevertheless, as known is related to the knower. In being conscious of another I am limited by it, both because it is what I am not and because I am determined by it in what I know of it. Hegel is keenly aware that there is a scale of forms of consciousness. From the lowest to the highest the subject in creasingly frees itself from the object, for the more abstract knowledge is the more it is the work of the subject, and the more "subjective" it is the freer is the subject.78 But what does this have to do with Christianity? "Spirit is all the greater," Hegel tells us, "the greater the opposition out of which it returns into itself . . ,"79 In Greek religion spirit was at peace with itself, in Christianity it is at war with itself. Christianity requires reconciliation more than any other religion does because it "tears apart the natural unity of spirit and destroys the natural peace. Man appears in it as evil from his birth . . . and in his innermost being in contradiction with himself."80 This contradiction in the self leads to an extreme selfishness (Selbstischkeit) which</page><page sequence="12">HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 209 is not, however, selfish (selbsts?chtig). And this is just the principle of knowledge!81 The absolute religion is absolute because in Christianity divine nature and human nature are the same nature. This is symbolized in the identity of the Father and the Son. In Christianity the absolute worth of subjectivity is recognized, and this is the principle of the modern world, which recognizes no foreignness in the object of consciousness. What is nailed on the cross is sen suous, immediate individuality.82 The Crucified, Kant's discovery of the transcendental unity of consciousness, and the French Revolution are stations along the same road! Transferring "the inner into the outer, the building of reason into the real world ... is the task of the world during the entire course of its history."83 Hegel will go so far as to hyphenate "Socrates Luther"?but he adds that while the period of Charles V can be compared to the time of Pericles it lacks a Pericles, and therefore lacks political freedom.84 Hegel's language is the language of Christianity and this enables him (but we have been warned of that!) to quote Scripture when he chooses. It has even been suggested that Geist be translated "ghost"! But is Hegel a Christian? The question of the truth of Christianity, Hegel tells us, is really two questions: "1. Is it really true that God does not exist apart from the Son, and that He has sent Him into the world? 2. Was this particular individual, Jesus of Nazareth, the Carpenter's son, the Son of God, the Christ?"85 The answer to the first question is Hegel's own philosophy of spirit anticipated, but not understood, by the Scriptures. The second question, of so much in terest to a Christian, is not of much interest to Hegel. Would Hegel make Pascal's fearful wager? "The question of the immortality of the Soul," in Hegel's view, "can only be of interest, if matter as a true being on one side and Spirit as a thing on the other is presupposed."86 But Hegel supposes the opposite: "Spirit is the truth of matter, that matter has no truth."87 This means that matter is potential Spirit, but also that Spirit requires matter. Hegel recognizes the "demand for immortality," but for him this means that subjectivity possesses an infinite worth. Philosophically understood, the im mortality of spirit is its freedom, the fact that it thinks and knows, that it knows what eternity is, and not that it has eternal duration?the "bad in finite." "In the notion once is always."88 We are saved from finitude by thought: When I think an object I become objective and renounce my par ticularity?and this is true humility.89 If this is Christian humility then Hegel is a Christian. Undeniably, Hegel's philosophy is religious. Hegel believed that "religion can exist without philosophy but not philosophy without religion"; yet he was also convinced that the "witness of spirit in its highest form is</page><page sequence="13">210 EDWARD BLACK philosophy."90 In an age when art and religion, the other forms of absolute spirit, no longer cause us "to bend our knee" philosophy must be recognized as the truest form of devotion.91 Spirit must appear, must develop itself in time, but it appears in time only so long as it does not perfectly understand itself: this self-understanding is philosophy. In philosophy consciousness is identical with self-consciousness; for philosophy the whole of history is "a gallery of pictures."92 The absolute moment of history is when history is understood. After Hegel, Feuerbach complained: "The Hegelian philosophy is the abolition of the contradictions between thinking and being . . . but merely within the contradiction?within one of its elements, within thought"; he demanded that "that in man which does not philosophize . . . which in Hegel appears only in footnotes" be promoted to "the text of philosophy." "In this way," he prophesied, "philosophy will become a universal irrefutable, irresistable power."93 Marx complied by reducing to a footnote what had been the text. By the little that satisfies us we can measure our loss. Edward Black San Jose State University NOTES 1. Hegel, Ph?nomenologie, ed. Hoffmeister (Hamburg: Felix Meiner, 1952), p. 14. 2.
