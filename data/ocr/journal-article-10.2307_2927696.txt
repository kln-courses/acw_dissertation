<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gordon E. Projecting Gender: Personification in Thompson the Works of Zora Neale Hurston C oncerning voice in Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God, Robert Stepto declares: "Hurston's curious insis- tence on having Janie's tale-her personal history in and as a literary form-told by an omniscient third person, rather than by a first-person narrator, implies that Janie has not really won her voice and self after all-that her author (who is, quite likely, the omniscient narrating voice) cannot see her way clear to giving Janie her voice outright."'I Stepto con- cludes that "control of the tale remains, no matter how unintended, with the author alone" (Stepto, 166). Henry Louis Gates Jr., in his discussion of free indirect discourse, has summed up much of the scholarship associated with the problem of voice in Their Eyes Were Watching God.2 Rather than attempt to establish that either Janie's or Hurston's voice ultimately controls the text, Gates and others have noted a rather high degree of cooperation and intimacy be- tween the two voices. This literary convention so greatly illuminates the novel's inner workings that the issue of control as originally framed by Stepto has been eclipsed. Although the approach of Gates and others has proven valuable, I nevertheless agree with Stepto's position that Hurston is ultimately in control of her text. Yet as Stepto says, "Hurston is genuinely caught in the dilemma of how she might both govern and exploit the autobiographical impulses that partially direct her creation of Janie" (Stepto, 166). I hope to indicate here how readers may resolve the "dilemma" with which Stepto says Hurston is burdened. As I see it, Hurston "governs" and "exploits" her "autobiographical impulses" not only in the creation of Janie, but also, and more important, in the creation of most of her fiction.

More to the point, my reading involves exploring the connections made throughout Hurston's work between the literary convention of personification and the psychology of projection. The following discussion will attempt to make clear how Hurston's use of projection and personification functions to reflect her attainment of a literary voice. This leads us to how Hurston projected her gender upon a male storytelling tradition as well as how her ideas concerning a folktale genre are characterized chiefly by their reliance upon personified images. Her philosophical investigation of issues related to gender and storytell- ing remains submerged, however, beneath more colorful and dynamic narrative episodes, such as those associated with travel. A trope that can be easily reinterpreted as a species of social projection, metaphors of the journey reveal another dimension of Hurston's method-namely, the nondidactic means of depicting gender differences vis-a-vis the inner self. She uses travel to contrast the negatives of domesticity with the benefits of exploration and its self-affirming powers, be such exploration fanciful and psychological or literary and geographical. Consequently, throughout her works, but particularly when using metaphors of travel, Hurston uses personification as a device to make new locales appear strange and won- derful and therefore desirable, or contrarily, she makes various places appear uncanny, frightening, and undesirable. When the personification is negative, Hurston is setting up a problematic or conflict-often related to gender or the storytelling tradition-that she intends to resolve. But while gender and its intraracial component are critical issues in the black community and a major theme with which many African American women's texts are identified,3 Hurston handles neither issue in a con- ventionally literary or orthodox, party-line fashion.4 Rather, Hurston's privileging of black folkloric materials represents the key to her cham- pioning of black and black female "self-determination."5 Racial conflict in Hurston, hence, remains muted and indirect and her handling of gen- der concerns somewhat problematic, especially in light of contemporary feminist ideology.6 While many scholars have examined Hurston's Dust Tracks on a Road with a view toward extracting from it the intimate details of her life</page><page sequence="3">Personification in Hurston's Works 739 that could serve to reinforce our reading of her fictions and deepen our understanding of Hurston herself, few have been satisfied with what this autobiography has had to offer.7 In Robert Hemenway's view, for ex- ample, Zora Neale Hurston was incapable of creating a coherent vision of her life in Dust Tracks on a Road. Though impressed with Hurston's work, Hemenway expresses some major reservations in his introduction to the latest edition of Hurston's autobiography: "Hurston avoided any exploration of the private motives that led to her public success. Where is the author of Their Eyes Were Watching God? One is never sure in Dust Tracks, even as we know that the mystery behind the question-who is Zora Neale Hurston?-continually sends us back to the Dust Tracks text for whatever clues might be wrestled from its enigmatic author" (DTOAR, xxxv-xxxix). Even as he appears mystified by Hurston's style, Hemenway is nevertheless on target. We are, indeed, continually led back to Dust Tracks on a Road for clues to Hurston's talent, where she does paint, as is her style, a vision within which one might discover those "private motives" that helped to create her literary style. "I am so visual minded that all the other senses induce pictures in me," Hurston once stated. So for Hemenway, "one sees Hurston's prose." Her style, explains Hemenway, is a "natural by-product of her attempt to represent the oral voice in written narrative . .. a process," Hemenway declares, "that marks the only times that public and private personae come together." Her "expressive language . . . is really a complex prod- uct of an author who sees through two sets of eyes simultaneously" (DTOAR, xxxvi). Hemenway suggests, nevertheless, that "Hurston never found a voice that could unify the dualistic vision of Dust Tracks" (DTOAR, xxxv). Her style "becomes a kind of camouflage," he says, "an escape from articu- lating the paradoxes of her personality" (DTOAR, xxxviii). This style of writing does not make her a "serious painter" of visual imagery, he concludes; and so, in the end, Dust Tracks fails as a literary statement because it is "deliberately less than its author's talents" (DTOAR, xxxix). To some degree, Nellie McKay appears to concur, pointing out that the autobiography "does not reveal intimate details" of Hurston's life; and neither is the text "a polemic on racial injustice."8 But McKay explains these absences brilliantly, thereby turning Hem- enway's argument on its head. She suggests that "in attempting to cope with the powerlessness and vulnerability of the racial self, blacks have employed language strategies, particularly artifice and concealment, in</page><page sequence="4">740 American Literature their relation with white America." She concludes that Hurston, in a similar act of concealment, rooted her autobiographical identity in "the collective self of Eatonville" (McKay, 176). Thus, in a strategy aimed at combating the negatives of the racial and/or sexual gaze, Hemenway's aesthetic or stylistic "camouflage" becomes McKay's "concealment." It seems, however, that if Hurston employed the language of conceal- ment, it was, paradoxically, a language of revelation as well; for Hurston was not a typically bookish introvert: she was extraordinarily extro- verted. And while she certainly spoke in a voice rooted in the "collective self of Eatonville," it is perhaps more accurate to say this collective self offers Hurston a transparent vehicle for the conveyance of her creative impulses. Elizabeth Fox-Genovese bolsters this theory considerably: Hurston, according to Fox-Genovese, set "her sights on an ideal beyond the hori- zon of everyday life [and] . . . beyond the boundaries of her gender."9 Hurston, she adds, "unmistakably identifies the problematic relation be- tween her private self and her self-representation: "'I did not know then,"' Fox-Genovese quotes Hurston, "'as I know now, that people are prone to build a statue of the kind of person that it pleases them to be"' (176). McKay would agree with this elaboration, especially when she describes the image Hurston presents of herself in Dust Tracks as the creation of a "black female self." One must ask, finally, what were the tools and what media did Hurston employ in her construction of a private self for public consumption? 10 In the best moments of her autobiography, Hurston's presence is clearly pronounced. Though she may have a dualistic vision, and one which is all about camouflage or concealment, her vision is in fact re- flected in a literary style perfectly suited to expressing her deepest desires." In Dust Tracks, Hurston's act of concealment serves as a meta- phor not only for the representation of her historical persona, but also as she might interpret the character of her black folk community. The literary convention and the rhetorical technique best suited to represent Hurston's "camouflaged" style and rhetoric of concealment are, respec- tively, personification and prosopopoeia. Thus, if one examines the many manifestations of personification or prosopopoeia in Dust Tracks, one will notice that Hurston paints, as is her custom, a vision within which one might discover those "private motives" that helped to create her literary style and, albeit submerged, ideological rhetoric. In fact, personification appears to be a major component of Hurston's</page><page sequence="5">Personification in Hurston's Works 741 literary style as witnessed by its presence and function in her four novels, short fictions, autobiography, and anthropological treatises.'2 An exami- nation of the connection between how Hurston uses personification in these fictions and in her autobiography informs us not only about the poli- tics of folktale telling in the black community but also about the reciprocal effect these folk tales then had on Hurston's own tales and her autobio- graphical posture. Such an approach, I believe, is eminently reasonable since, as it becomes more and more obvious, "the distinction between fiction and autobiography is not an either/or polarity," but, as Paul de Man observes, very likely "undecidable." 13 * *- Hurston's second novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God-which can be thought of as a "fictionalized autobiography"-can serve as an example of how Hurston utilized the vagaries of the convention of personification and the rhetoric of prosopopoeia in her fictions. The text opens with meta- phors of judgment and retribution: "So the beginning of this was a woman and she had come back from burying the dead. Not the dead of sick and ailing with friends at the pillow and the feet. She had come back from the sodden and the bloated; the sudden dead, their eyes flung wide open in judgment" (TEWWG, 9). A clear reference is made here to the storm and subsequent flood which, over two-hundred pages later, is quite tra- ditionally anthropomorphized or personified-a storm that changes the course of the heroine's psychic life: "'De lake is comin'!' and the pursuing waters growled and shouted ahead, 'Yes, Ah'm comin'!', and those who could fled on" (TEWWG, 240). In this episode, personification is mani- fested when a personality or "face" is given to a nonsentient object and to an "absent power." Superimposing a second "face" over the face or personality of certain characters (or characteristics) comes into focus as an identifying feature of Hurston's work. At the commencement of her first novel, Jonah's Gourd Vine (1934),'4 for instance, Hurston's handling of personification as projection is fasci- natingly complex. The narrator announces that "God was grumbling his thunder and playing the zig-zag lighting thru his fingers" (JGV, 9). The narrator's statement represents a classic Hurston image which Hurston herself describes as "crayon enlargements of life," or "thought pictures," "mind-pictures" that bring feelings that drag "out dramas from the hol- lows" of her characters' hearts. Immediately following the narrator's observations about God's grum-</page><page sequence="6">742 American Literature bling, Amy Crittenden decides "Ole Massa gwinter scrub floors tuh- day." Her expression-another personified image-is exceedingly close to that of the narrator's, with the main exception that Amy's speech is represented in "dialect." As a result of this similarity in their "modes" of imagining the world, a certain intimacy is established between the nar- rator and Amy.'5 One might also detect Amy's need to bring the world closer to her, to make it more intelligible and less awesome. "Ole Massa," for example, is going to scrub floors just like Amy. More pointedly, here is a powerful instance of psychological projection presented in the form of a personified visual image, providing us with a "mind-picture" of, or glimpse into, Amy's heart.'6 Though it is the approach of rain to which Amy refers, her projection of a new image onto the world also reveals the power of personification, like metaphor, to "remake" reality.'7 Amy's behavior becomes a prototype for many of Hurston's characters who also project their designs, fears, or desires upon inanimate objects or even other characters to transform the world into a more manipulable and manageable environment. Moreover, when linked with the "zig-zag" lighting and the grumbling thunder introduced by the narrator, "Ole Massa's" scrubbing-or cleans- ing as Amy sees it-takes on a wrathful, vengeful tone. Amy's act of projection thus reveals her deeply felt need for judgment and retribu- tion-a notion reinforced, in fact, by the entire tenor of Jonah's Gourd Vine; indeed, if the pathos of its wayward hero's tragic and sudden death at the end of the text does not demonstrate as much, nothing else will. Personification is used here to express Amy's need for justice and retribu- tion and perhaps, more conventionally, a longing for escape, be it physical or mental.'8 Amy's novel image, in its collapsing of two instances of personifica- tion, reveals the indeterminacy of the distinction between psychological projection, a cognitive term associated with personality, and personifi- cation, an artistic convention. For psychologists, personification is also a projected image "an individual has of himself or of another person. It is a complex of feelings, attitudes, and conceptions that grows out of experi- ences with need-satisfaction and anxiety." '9 But Quintillian's definition of prosopopoeia, from whence our current notions of personification are derived, includes rhetorical figures by which an "inanimate or abstract thing is represented as a person with personal characteristics," or "a per- son or thing in which some quality or abstraction is as it were embodied" [OED]. In the context of personification, certainly "embodied" would be synonymous with projected.20</page><page sequence="7">Personification in Hurston's Works 743 Thus in Hurston one ought not to emphasize the literary aspect of personification without noting its psychological, projective aspect; the converse should also be noted. The common ground between the two lies in the superimposition and thus projection of the subject's needs or de- sires onto the world-the result would be a personified image. By focus- ing on the subject's needs and desires, by locating and analyzing them, the reader is able to discover the correlation between strategies hidden in rhetorical patterns, tropes, and metaphors and more overt narrative units, plots, themes, and narrative structures.2' In this regard, the following episode from Their Eyes is particularly revealing: "Through the pollinated air she [Janie] saw a glorious being coming up the road. In her former blindness she had known him as shift- less Johnny Taylor, tall and lean. That was before the golden dust of pollen had beglamored his rags and her eyes" (25). Projection here is created by taking a given image, the ragged, shiftless Johnny Taylor, and attach- ing to him a second image-here, a beglamored and glorious one which represents the erotic projection of the heroine. The difference between the given object and the additional superimposed image serves to high- light the displaced and deferred aspects of the original object. "Clearly," says Michael Awkward, "Janie's 'pollinated' perception of Johnny Taylor is faulty." It is her "intense desire for a mate" that forces her to see him as she wishes rather than as her community believes she should. "She views him," in short, "in [a historical] manner," says Awkward, "that is inconsistent with her knowledge of his character."22 Janie's act of pro- jection exemplifies the sharp discrepancy between what actually exists and what Janie thinks she sees. Psychologists recognize this phenome- non as a form of projection, explained as the "tendency on the part of the subject to perceive or understand his environment in such a manner as to make it congruent with or justify his needs, affects, and impulses ... [in short] his own emotional state" (Hall and Lindzey, 195). The strange guises that this mercurial allegorical convention takes in Hurston's work are understandably multiple.23 To take another example, when Janie goes off with her lover, Tea Cake, she rejects the community's judgments and restrictions, for the commu- nity believes that Tea Cake is neither old enough for the mature Janie, nor rich enough for the relatively wealthy widow she has become, nor light enough for the light-complexioned beauty with long flowing hair that she continues to be despite her age. By running off with Tea Cake, however, Janie appears to have discovered her perfect lover. As she might see it, having turned against both her grandmother's and the community's</page><page sequence="8">744 American Literature wishes, she finally finds love. She feels very little guilt, and, conse- quently, appears to have "conquered"-in a manner of speaking-her superego. But later, her personification of the lake or "sea" in the flood and storm episode, in fact, suggests otherwise. For it appears Janie has internalized, to some extent, the community's taboos or laws; as I have argued elsewhere,24 if she has, she is in great part a representative of her community-a "model per-sona."25 Conse- quently, Janie may not be able to escape the community's wishes because she carries them with her, inside her psyche. Hence the following epi- sode is blatant, exceptional, and rather telling directly as the result of the presence of personified images:26 "The monstropolous beast had left his bed. The two hundred miles an hour wind had loosed his chains. He seized hold of his dikes and ran forward until he met the quarters; uprooted them like grass and rushed on after his supposed-to-be con- querors, rolling the dikes, rolling the houses, rolling the people in the houses along with other timbers. The sea was walking the earth with a heavy heel" (TE WWG, 239). Because she personifies the storm and gives it vindictive intentions, one might wonder if Janie implicitly accepts the storm as an act of divine retribution. In fact, to the extent that the flood is responsible-though indirectly-for the death of her Tea Cake, a man the community in its fears and jealousies rejects, the superego was not slain but had only lain dormant. Such would be true if Janie has projected the "face" of her re- strictive community upon the lake, turned it wrathful and retributive so that its actions appear to do the community's bidding, its face reflecting the heroine's superego or bad conscience-in short, guilt. Once the dic- tates of the superego reappear in the guise of the flooding lake, she is unmasked as being at best a "supposed-to-be conqueror." As a manifes- tation of Janie's deeper fears, the personified lake proves a stronger force than the community, whose taboos she believes she has conquered. It is no wonder, then, that Janie's shooting of Tea Cake is his most immediate cause of death; for she has, as I say, internalized these very taboos. The trope of personification is unpacked and we discover the text's private symbolism, which otherwise comes to us highly disguised and displaced. In Hurston's last work, Seraph on the Suwanee (1948), her ideas con- cerning projection and personification are rendered in a highly naturalistic medium.27 When Arvay, the protagonist, is first introduced to the swamp, her "eyes flew open in terror." She makes it clear that she doesn't "want no parts of that awful place. It's dark and haunted-looking and too big</page><page sequence="9">Personification in Hurston's Works 745 and strong to overcome. It's frightening!" (71). In her youth, Arvay dem- onstrated an aversion to men after having been spurned. The novel is exclusively concerned with Arvay's unusual fear of men, a fear that colors her relationship with her husband and poisons her family life, for she re- sides in a marriage to which she does not reconcile herself until text's end. It is not difficult to see that in her aversion to men, Arvay may see them rather than the swamp as being "dark and haunted-looking and too big and strong to overcome"-indeed, based on how Arvay treats her husband, this image comes close to describing how Arvay must also regard him. Arvay's fear of the swamp, one could say, is a reflection of some personified image (of men) that she projects upon this natural, nonsentient phenomenon. Such a vision is in line with the psychology of projection, a "mechanism by which neurotic or moral anxiety is con- verted into an objective fear" (Hall and Lindzey, 50). Though Arvay may be afraid of the swamp, she is afraid of something else besides-namely, sexuality. For deep psychological reasons related to her rigid formulation of sexual motives, Arvay finds lovemaking with her husband difficult and almost intolerable. While Arvay believes she is passing judgment on this swamp, Hurston sets up Arvay so that the reader may pass judgment on Arvay's personality or character and psychological stability. From a psychological perspective, projection conversion is "easily made because the original source of both neurotic and moral anxiety is fear of punishment from an external agent." But projection also "reduces anxiety by substituting a lesser danger for a greater one" (Hall and Lindzey, 50). Here we see that it is not "objective reality which serves as a determi- nant of behavior but rather objective reality as it is perceived or assigned meaning by the individual" (Hall and Lindzey, 25). In "Sweat" (from a collection of Hurston's short stories entitled Spunk, 1985),28 personification takes still another form, that of symbolic tool. Delia, the heroine of "Sweat," has been beaten and abused by her hus- band, Sykes. When he terrorizes her with a snake, the snake-especially in Sykes's absence-serves as a substitute for and reflection of Sykes, further defining the nature of his character. Delia's attitude towards the snake resembles her attitude towards Sykes; Sykes's manipulation of the snake and his bravado suggest-in the context of the story-that han- dling snakes is a male privilege. This social maxim is upset, however, when Sykes is killed by this same snake, allowing Delia to triumph in the end. In one of the earliest moments in Hurston's oeuvre, an independent woman is thus partially responsible for her husband's death, thus signal-</page><page sequence="10">746 American Literature ing Hurston's move towards depicting women who change their lives by seeing their world anew. Similar symbolism confronts us in Their Eyes when Janie uses a shot- gun to kill her crazed lover, Tea Cake. Sykes and Tea Cake are killed only after they come to personify certain animals: Sykes, the lowly snake that bites him; the rabies-infected Tea Cake, with his loping walk and his mad need to bite Janie, a rabid dog that must be shot. But the dispos- ing of Tea Cake has greater symbolic significance: Tea Cake's essential personality is not truly slain, since for all intents and purposes when she shoots Tea Cake, Janie is shooting the mad dog Tea Cake in his madness now impersonates. The privileged personality of Tea Cake-as the in- carnation of positive male behavior-is actually preserved. As Awkward says, but from a slightly different perspective: "The fact that Tea Cake ultimately fails to achieve the status of ideal male as delineated by late- twentieth-century literary critics does not detract from the effectiveness of his gifts" (52). By text's end, with Tea Cake gone, Janie begins-but not so mi- raculously-to impersonate (or personify) the image of the independent male. And here personification takes on still another guise: that of the mask. She inherits all the trappings the text had hitherto ascribed to men (notably, most were almost exclusively traits and behavior exemplified by Tea Cake): she is, relative to the other members of her community, inde- pendently wealthy, and she wears overalls, knows how to fish, but more important, how to shoot a rifle-all gifts (except the wealth) she inherits from living with Tea Cake. She also remains free enough to choose any man she wishes. In this way, Janie is elevated to a position in which she may tell her own tales of anthropomorphized creatures and personified beings, as indicated by the tale of the talking buzzards thatJanie imagines, but which is articulated by the narrator in free indirect discourse. In great part, Janie appropriates through various forms of imperson- ation the arbitrary signs or "signifiers" of manhood without appropriating the thing or "signified" itself-that is, maleness. Interestingly, Hurston's transfer of privileges associated with men onto women such as Janie, is sustained, though in a somewhat complex manner, throughout Hurston's oeuvre. Janie's battle with the law, with forces that judge and condemn, finally must also be taken into account. It is no wonder circumstances arise that force Janie into an actual court of law where she must await the judgment of white men-another manifestation of power to which Janie and her</page><page sequence="11">Personification in Hurston's Works 747 black community are subject. But the very fact that she is accused of cold- blooded murder, not only by white law but by black people as well, further aligns the black community with the flood that terrifies the dog, which, in turn, bites and transmits rabies to Tea Cake. Perhaps, while we are alerted to Janie's thirst for justice and her tremendous struggle to ward off the effects of communal and social persecution, we are also alerted to Hurston's more private concerns in this regard. For, when understood as a form of psychological projection, personified images in Hurston's texts may not only reveal her characters' hidden motivations, they might also reveal, like an actor's mask, Hurston's own private concerns or motives, though serving, initially, as a form of distancing that acts to shield the author from direct scrutiny, as in any successful fictional enterprise. s a . Perhaps Hurston's need to conceal was as much a literary impulse as it was an internal directive whose origins may be found in her personal past. When we turn to Hurston's life, for instance, we find that she can- not say exactly when she "began to make up stories," but "Little things that people did or said," as she reveals in her autobiography, "grew into fantastic stories" (DTOAR, 78). She speaks of trees and lakes as if they were men, and of men who turn into alligators-no more at first than the usual fantasies of children, but neither her father nor her grandmother would stand for it. Once she ran out of the house to escape a whipping from her father. But her grandmother's fury was worse. After Zora re- lated a tale to her mother, her grandmother glared at her like "open-faced hell and snorted," demanding that the mother "Wring [Zora's] coat tails over her head and wear out a handful of peach hickories on her back-side! Stomp her guts out! Ruin her!" (DTOAR, 71-72). Hurston never ex- plains her grandmother's or her father's fury except to say that they were responding to her stories as simple lies: "My phantasies were still fight- ing against the facts," Hurston rationalizes, thus laying the foundation for her later literary exploits (DTOAR, 83). For black women, as black feminist bell hooks suggests, "the urge to construct a writer-identity" is generated by a need to "challenge and sub- due all impulses" that lead "away from speech into silence."29 hooks's commentary offers timely insight into Hurston's response to her grand- mother's outrage and her father's ire. Only partially daunted, Zora con- tinues, for instance, to quench her imaginative needs by clandestinely personifying discarded household objects, thereby creating a world of her</page><page sequence="12">748 American Literature own. In a chapter entitled "Figure and Fancy," Zora picked up an ear of corn and crawled under the side of the house to love it all by myself. In a few minutes, it had become Miss Corn-Shuck, and of course needed some hair. So I went back and picked up some cornsilk and tied it to the pointed end. We had a lovely time together then Miss Corn-Shuck got lonesome for some company. I do not think that her lonesomeness would have come down on her as it did, if I had not found a cake of sweet soap in Mama's dresser drawer.... So Miss Corn-Shuck fell in love with Mr. Sweet Smell. (DTOAR, 73) The deepest, most cherished aspect of Zora Neale Hurston's person- ality-the one of which she was most aware-was her desire to paint the world in crayon enlargements of life because this would be not only how she saw it, but also a vivid style of representation that permeated her very being. In Hurston's mind, her fantasies and personifications are closely associated with the tales the townsfolk related on the store porch. She says that the reason "the store porch was the most interesting place I could think of" is that there she could hear the "menfolk holding a 'lying' session," an activity on which she loved to eavesdrop. These men told tales about "God, the Devil, animals and natural elements," many of which "stirred up fancies in men. It did not surprise me at all to hear that the animals talked" (DTOAR, 69). Of course, this phenomenon does not surprise little Zora, for as Dust Tracks demonstrates, Zora's relationship to storytelling was not only a preconscious formation, since she was un- able to say exactly when she "began to make up stories"; it was also a very personal activity, in light of her clandestine storymaking sessions alone behind the house, as well as a communal, though highly restricted activity, as represented in her eavesdropping on the store porch's "lying" sessions. Without a doubt, for Hurston, these animal fables, with their anthropomorphic, personified creatures, continued to hold deep cultural implications; she would naturally find it supremely unjust that anyone would want to prevent her from indulging in these fantasies. Hurston offers several hints as to what she appreciated about the tales she heard as a child on her family's front porch and on the store porch. "I picked up glints and gleams out of what I heard and stored it away to turn it to my own uses," she says. Her own tales, it appears, were formed through a process of accretion, by "adding detail" to the tales</page><page sequence="13">Personification in Hurston's Works 749 she heard on the porch. In this way, by expanding on tales and anec- dotes from her daily experiences, "Life took on," she says, "a bigger perimeter" (DTOAR, 69)-"bigger perimeter" referring as much to her imaginative life as it does to her enlarging sense of the physical world. In short, tale-telling was connected in Hurston's mind with reenvision- ing worlds-the fantastic or personified character of which imaginatively transported these worlds to her or brought her closer to them.30 It becomes increasingly obvious that by earning the license to tell tall tales, Hurston's writing career represents her attempt to achieve what she was not allowed to indulge in when she was a child. Hurston's decision to write was additionally complicated by her identification of storytell- ing with men and male privileges-a concept impressed on her by her family and neighbors in the all-black town of Eatonville, Florida, during the early decades of the twentieth century. Having internalized and thus accepted this traditional precept, Hurston found it necessary to come to terms with this gender-based prescription even in her fictions. "Hurston," Fox-Genovese concurs, "should be understood as a woman who was, in terms of self-representation, concerned primarily with a 'self' uncon- strained by gender in particular and condition in general" (Fox-Genovese, 193).31 Consequently, by creating tales governed by personified images, Hurston "literarily" impersonates the men who told fantastic stories. She transforms the male perspective of the world by superimposing upon their tall tales a presence of her own-a presence manifested by her fictional narrators. It is possible, then, that by uncovering the meanings behind Hurston's use of personification, we may discover what McKay calls Hurston's "created fictional self," a self, in short, that would be per- mitted to tell tall tales.32 Perhaps Hurston's personified images hide or mask, as with psychological projection, her "private motives"-one of which might be her need to attack traditional notions of the storyteller and the socially determined requisite gender of that storyteller. From the very start of her writing career, Hurston looked for ways to express her concerns about the politics of storytelling in her all black community. We need take only one example to acknowledge Hurston's struggle with presenting herself, and therefore women, as storytellers. In her earliest published piece, for instance, in order to camouflage her private (female) concerns with telling tall tales and travel, Hurston pur- posely uses a male rather than a female character to dramatize these concerns and their interrelatedness in Hurston's universe.</page><page sequence="14">750 American Literature In "John Redding Goes to Sea" (1926), written long before Dust Tracks, Hurston recounts the life and tragic death of one John Redding, a boy whose inner life is strangely reminiscent of the girl, Zora.33 Here a com- parison of an episode from the autobiography and one from the tale may be illustrative, for a link can be drawn between the imaginative life of Hurston as a young girl and of the boy, John. First, examine Zora's de- scription of a pine tree in her yard: "It was just another pine tree about a hundred feet tall then, standing head and shoulders above a grove. But let the dusk begin to fall, and it would put the crown on its skull and creep in close" (DTOAR, 70). Notice the contribution of the sun and shadow to Zora's personification of the tree and the fear she feels as a consequence of her insight. Similarly, John Redding and his father are taking a walk when John notices a peculiar looking tree; notice that John is as fearful of his own perceptions as is Zora in the previous excerpt: "See dat tallest pine tree ovah dere how it looks like a skull wid a crown on?" "Yes, indeed!" said the father looking toward the tree designated. "It do look lak a skull since you call mah 'tention to it. You 'magine lotser things nobody else evah did, son!" "Sometimes, Pa dat ole tree waves at me just aftah th' sun goes down, an' makes me sad an' skeered, too." ("John Redding," 16) As mentioned earlier, Hurston's peculiar inner life was highly restricted by communal and familial prohibitions-prohibitions John Redding also encounters. Back at home, John's mother clearly distrusts her son's per- sonification of his environment. In Dust Tracks, it was both Hurston's father and her father's mother who distrusted Zora's personification of her surroundings. We may find that the father's pride in his son, John Redding, fulfills an emotional need Hurston's father only occasionally ful- filled for her, one which her mother more frequently met. And yet, John's father happily realizes that his son can "imagine lotser things nobody else evah did" ("John Redding," 16). To an extent, then, one can see that John Redding "impersonates"-though with a notable change in gender-the figure of Hurston as we have seen her describe herself in Dust Tracks. Autobiography as a creative or imaginative act takes on great urgency here. For it is worth keeping in mind that Hurston's autobiography was written many years after this short story-a fact which might cause one to ponder the age-old problem of life imitating art (and the reverse), especially when that life, represented and displaced into and by language,</page><page sequence="15">Personification in Hurston's Works 751 then follows rather than precedes an earlier artistic representation of the same. Two points must be emphasized: "John Redding Goes to Sea" serves as an entree into the literary world for Hurston. This is quite appropri- ate, for by first changing the gender, Hurston proceeds to endow/invest her (male) hero with desires it has been shown Hurston herself had, but which were not recorded until well after the short story was written. The fact that the change in gender serves to mask as well as distance the author from her literary production should now be evident. But Hurston appears to have continued to apply this technique which actually turns out to be a form of personification, since such a mask is nothing else if it is not the creation of a version of the author in disguise.34 When Hurston changes the gender of a character, furthermore-though this act may occur prior to or outside of the text-she employs a structure or mecha- nism not unlike that associated with the convention of personification or prosopopoeia, which is the creation of face through defacement, a trope, quintessentially autobiographical, that shuttles between autobiographical rhetoric and that of fiction. It thus provides a method of reading that tran- scends the limitations of traditional methods of biographical exegesis. As such, the projection of individualized, personal characteristics onto other objects would constitute the most definitive attribute of personified images.35 For Hurston, telling tall tales about personified figures, travel, and sexual infidelities are not only related to one another but are also linked with men. Travel, for instance, appears to be closely linked with sexual promis- cuity, as when Hurston identifies her father by his "meanderings" from Alabama to Florida and also with his possible infidelities, as suggested in her comment: "looking back, I take it that Papa and Mama, in spite of his meanderings, were really in love" (DTOAR, 18). These travel and sexual pursuits are certainly privileges coveted by the men in Hurston's life; given that men-at least traditionally and conventionally-are allowed somewhat greater leeway in respect to sexually illicit relationships, the ability to be open about such relationships-at least among men-is a privilege men are allowed to exercise with less social opprobrium than women. Yet preventing their men from "wandering" would represent a considerable burden to the women in Hurston's life and fiction, as is noted in the attitude of John Redding's mother.</page><page sequence="16">752 American Literature Hurston dates the beginnings of her own travels with the occasion of her mother's death as represented in a chapter of Dust Tracks entitled "Wandering." The previous chapter, "Figure and Fancy," contains much of the information about her imaginative activities. Hence, it is not sur- prising that "Wandering" should follow, for here Hurston's association of travel with death is (re)configured. As her many titles suggest, travel also resides at the center of her literary concerns, not only in Dust Tracks onA Road and "John Redding Goes to Sea" but in all of her fictions. When John Redding reaches manhood, for instance, he too, like his father John, has a great desire to travel. It is no wonder that the perceived perver- sity of John Redding's imagination would entice him to do something his mother simply cannot tolerate, such as travel, especially travel by sea. By expanding the "perimeters" of his world, so to speak,`6 travel offers John a physical extension or projection of what he feels when personify- ing objects in his immediate environment. John's mother and later John's wife fear John's need to travel, creating a strong familial prohibition with which John must contend. John's father tries to explain John's desire to his befuddled wife: "Matty, a man doan need no travel dust tuh make 'im wanter hit de road. It jes' comes natcheral fuh er man tuh travel," he says in response to Matty's belief that a witch has sprinkled her son with travel "dust" ("John Redding," 18). Pointedly, travel is an inner force inexplicable to women like Matty. To the extent John's acts of personifica- tion are at all responsible for his fate, in Hurston's texts, personification, like travel, comes to signify escape from communities perceived as small and confining. So it is quite provocative that, as described in Dust Tracks, Hurston's mother believes that when Zora was quite young she was likely to con- tinue to walk in the direction of the horizon until someone came for her: "This alarmed my mother a great deal. She used to say that she believed a woman who was an enemy of hers sprinkled 'travel dust' around the doorstep the day I was born. . . . I don't know why it never occurred to her to connect my tendency with my father, who didn't have a thing on his mind but this town and the next one. That should have given her a sort of hint. Some children are just bound to take after their fathers in spite of women's prayers" (DTOAR, 32). Personification, then, espe- cially as found in Hurston's tales, also symbolizes travel or voyaging as a projection of the mind at play. Often the urge to personify is associated with the exploration of new worlds by projecting oneself physically or mentally. Travel serves as the physical form of this projection, personi-</page><page sequence="17">Personification in Hurston's Works 753 fication proper the psychological and/or imaginative equivalent. In this construction, Hurston's private preoccupations or motives become highly transparent. The relationship between personification and the tall tale, projection and travel-as a desire for movement, of flux even, of shifting ground-can bring with it a sense of groundlessness, of existing in a no- man's-land. While the traveler may be lauded for seeking to enlarge her cultural experience, she may also find that escaping the strictures of her cultural community is both difficult and painful; as depicted in Hurston's fictions, it is very likely deadly.37 Before John Redding can make his escape, for example, he is killed in a flood; Tea Cake, Janie's lover, is bitten during a flood, forcing Janie in the end-after shooting Tea Cake-to find her way back to her old home alone; and John Crittenden, fromJonah's Gourd Vine, is killed in a double irony, in his car by a train while in the process of rejecting his past life of sexual promiscuity. To the extent that the communal consciousness has been internalized, the traveling hero or heroine in Hurston's fictions is forced to conform. If travel in Hurston is depicted as a specific male need, as a privilege even, Janie in Their Eyes Were Watching God is a masterful exception. Storytelling, too, especially when dominated by instances of personifica- tion, is associated in Hurston's world with the life of men and boys more than it is with that of women. But storytelling and travel, as any Hurston reader would know, are also quintessential Hurston traits. Yet it is almost as if Hurston, being female, felt that storytelling was a taboo and decided to allow a male character to represent this aspect of herself. Even in the short excerpt from "John Redding," one notes the displacement of Zora's preoccupations with travel and notable imaginative abilities onto the boy, John Redding. In a manner of speaking, this displaced version of Zora allows Hurston to represent a private concern in a boy who now repre- sents a "virtual self" of the child Zora and her flights of fancy..8 Hurston appropriates by and in her writings selected male privileges convention- ally denied to women but ironically intrinsic to the private world of Zora Neale Hurston, which she then transfers back onto her male characters, as exemplified by her creation of John Redding. While it could be said that John Redding is a literary impersonation of Zora, it could also be said that certain aspects of Hurston's autobiog- raphy might actually be reprisals, paradoxically, of ideas she collected from "John Redding" and other early short stories. Whatever the case, Hurston's travel and creative interests, however much her own, were</page><page sequence="18">754 American Literature thought of by herself and others as activities from which women were strictly forbidden because they were considered to be strictly male privi- leges, not only because the community so stipulated, but also because Hurston may have, in fact, associated such privileges with a particular man, her father John. If so, it becomes more difficult, now, to determine whether certain motifs found in Hurston's fictions were patterned after her own life experiences or after those of her father. Whatever Hurston's problems with her father, she certainly sought to emulate him, particularly where storytelling and travel were concerned. The repetition of his name throughout her work is no accident. It is also no wonder that, like the "meanderings" of John Hurston, who was some- thing of a folk minister, John Crittenden of Jonah's Gourd Vine is also a folk minister who loves to travel; Moses, from Moses, Man of the Mountain, is also a man who travels in search of and at the command of God, be- coming the object of the obsessions of three different women. Though it also appears that John Redding, John Crittenden, Moses, and other male characters are initially taken from the same, but highly flexible template, this template appears to have been molded, again ironically, as much on the desires, wishes, and activities of Hurston's father as on Hurston her- self-Hurston's own travels and multiple relationships being, of course, almost common knowledge. So then, to what degree, one might ask, was Hurston's life merely an unconscious mimicking of her father's? As I see it, most of the heroes in Hurston's texts are male because they represent the privileged elite who are empowered to engage in activities Hurston covets; while she practiced these privileges in her actual life, she also adopts these privileges-perhaps secondhand-mostly through her male characters, though interestingly enough also through Janie. Consequently, the feminist perspective of Their Eyes Were Watching God must be reexamined; for even though Janie, the novel's protagonist, in her travels from locale to locale in search of love, appears to be a re- flection of Hurston's own travels and concomitant multiple marriages or matings, Janie may also appear to be a converted projection of Hurston's father. James Krasner points out that, "as it stands, Janie's life story is built on the male model." He demonstrates that in the language used by many feminist critics, "Janie's story" is directly tied "to the paradigm for male autobiography established at the beginning of" the novel.39 How feminist, then, can such a text be, if the heroine is only acting out male privileges? The answer in part is that Janie is not simply impersonat- ing men by remaining single and independent, or when she travels in a</page><page sequence="19">Personification in Hurston's Works 755 pair of overalls, as noted in the opening scene of the book, or when she actually has the will to use a hunting rifle on her lover-Janie is merely adopting privileges that Hurston regards, finally, as gender neutral. As Fox-Genovese noticed, "Once the gaps between sexuality and gender begin to appear, men and women can begin to question whether gender flows naturally from sexuality, whether social demands on the individual are biologically determined.... Neither masculinity nor femininity exists as an absolute" (Fox-Genovese, 187). And this is a conclusion at which Hurston also appears to have arrived. It is no wonder, then, that Hurston wrote stories generated in great part by personified images-images which lie at the heart of her attempt to remake in her own image the sexual/social traditions she encountered during her youth. But the roles and privileges of the sexes in the all-black town where Hurston was raised restricted her, since she was a girl, from making up tall tales or "lies," as they were called. That Hurston goes on to become a major writer of the tall tale flies in the face of these earlier prohibitions. The very act of writing, then, represents for Hurston a re- bellious moment of great social and literary significance, the indications or markings of which are figured as much in the structure and theme of her many texts as in their linguistic patterns. If only intuitively, it appears that Hurston was aware that storytell- ing in her black community-whatever other purposes such tales might serve-was a means of projecting human desires and passing judgment against a terribly unjust sociopolitical system. The black community "had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences" for the "bossman." But there comes a time, we learn in Their Eyes Were Watching God, "to hear things and talk." So when the bossman was gone, they became "lords of sound" and "sat in judgment" (TEWWG, 9-10). Storytelling, when understood as "lies" or "lying," to use Hurston's language, is a mytho- poeic activity that can "expand the perimeters" of one's life. Such an expansion may take place if "lying" is a means of "projecting" oneself both upon other sensibilities or into other worlds. At bottom, "lying" allows the actor to toss his/her desires out upon the world. The world can be either threatening or indifferent, against which the act of projection may serve as a defense mechanism. One may, in addition, seek to control the world far more aggressively by superimposing on it one's desires: the result could be a form of personification expressed in images as beautiful and as tenuous as "A mood come alive. Words walking without masters" (TEWWG, 10).</page><page sequence="20">756 American Literature Storytelling thus creates desirable conditions and gives one a sense of control. Perhaps this is also why men in Hurston's texts attempt to prohibit women from participating in this form of self-empowerment and self-assertion, which appears to be at the bottom of the struggle between Moses and Miriam in Hurston's third novel, Moses Man of the Mountain. But since storytelling in Hurston's community was dominated by "men- folk," with women tacitly prohibited from participating as equals among men, little Zora was not authorized to listen to or relate any animal tales. hooks explains how, just as children "were meant to be seen and not heard. . . . Madness, not just physical abuse, was the punishment for too much talk if you were female" (hooks, 7). It is no wonder, then, that in her earliest published short story, Hurston projects her youthful preoccupations with personification upon a boy-John Redding. But there are exceptions: in her anthropological treatise, Mules and Men,40 Hurston introduces "Big Sweet," a powerfully built woman with plenty of character and stories of her own. She is an exception to the male rule, for with her verbal and physical sorties, she challenges the black male world. Her decision to tell "lies" and other tales is carried out with a tremendous amount of self-assertive willpower. This anecdote sets the stage for Hurston's occult political concerns-namely, to subvert the notion that storytelling is essentially a male activity. Storytelling, what- ever traditional notions may be, can be appropriated by men or women. Consequently, "for us [black women]," as hooks says, "true speaking is not solely an expression of creative power; it is an act of resistance, a political gesture that challenges [the gender] politics of domination that would render us nameless and voiceless" (hooks, 8).41 Yet Hurston does not intend to feminize the storytelling process. Her "communal self" would prohibit so radical a turn; instead, she offers a more splendid compromise. She uses personification to bypass society's taboos so that she may appropriate the honors and privileges of the story- teller, which include the projection, or the enactment, of "virtual selves": in other words, "By insisting on being a self independent of history, race, and gender," as Fox-Genovese says, "she comes close to insisting on being a self independent of body" (Fox-Genovese, 197). Such a compromise represents perhaps one of the most significant lit- erary devices at work in Hurston's texts. That this transfer of Hurston's face or personality onto the other gender (or generic other) resembles the logic of personification-namely, the superimposition of one face over another-leads me to think that Hurston used personification in order to</page><page sequence="21">Personification in Hurston's Works 757 realize in some form her desire to act out privileges customarily asso- ciated with men, especially those concerned with telling tall tales, as well as her love of the fantastic and the highly imaginary images associated with personification. Such are the impulses that led her to retain this personifying convention in all its various guises, including the standard literary convention of character/author substitution. Therefore, by adopting the role of teller-of-tall-tales, Hurston takes on the role set aside in her community for black males. By exercising privileges traditionally identified as male, Hurston in a sense is able to impersonate or masquerade as male, at least from within the confines of certain social conventions. Personification is a concept, then, that appeals to Hurston because it lends itself so well to the structure and mechanism of impersonation; it allows a person to gain a certain power by taking on the characteristics of another. By writing texts characterized by personi- fied images, Hurston achieves two purposes: she bucks the tradition that prohibited her from writing and from telling tall tales, and in the writing of these tales, she is able to impersonate the role of the male writer and so overturn the restrictions she labored under as a child. Nevertheless, the storytelling is not re-gendered, for Hurston is a woman telling tales about women. And neither does she monopolize the tradition for women; instead, storytelling is rendered gender neutral, while the power of the imagination to remake the world is again reconfigured.

Cheryl A. Wall (New Brunswick: Rutgers Univ. Press, 1989), 21. 4 In fact, Hurston deliberately problematizes the issue of male/female roles. Gates says that she uses "two chiasmuses in her opening paragraphs" of Their Eyes Were Watching God. "The subject," he says, "of the second para- graph of [the novel] (women) reverses the subject of the first (men) and figures the nature of their respective desire in opposite terms" (Gates, The Signifying Monkey, 171). On chiasmus in Hurston's novel, Gates refers his readers to Ephi Paul, "Mah Tongue is in Mah Friends's Mouf," unpublished essay. But also see Maria Tai Wolff, "Listening and Living: Reading and Ex- perience in Their Eyes Were Watching God," in Black American Literature Forum 16 (spring 1982): 30. 5 Claire Crabtree indirectly responds to an article by Lloyd W. Brown on the ambiguous nature of the ending of Their Eyes Were Watching God in which the death of Janie's lover, Tea Cake, has been difficult to rationalize. "The apparent weakness of the ending of the novel," says Crabtree, "is perhaps explained by the possibility that Hurston, as a feminist, did not wantJanie to find fulfillment in a man, but rather in her new-found self."

Nevertheless, it seems worth pointing out, as Lorraine Bethel does, that one can see "Hurston's Black woman-identification not only in her words, but in her visual appear- ance as well.... The pictures we have show her as a naturally handsome</page><page sequence="23">Personification in Hurston's Works 759 woman who confronted sexual/gender conventions even in the way she dressed-frequently in rakish hats and in pants-and acted on the street, smoking publicly at a time when it was not considered ladylike.

Gloria T. Hull, Patricia Bell Scott, and Barbara Smith (Old Westbury, N.Y.: The Feminist Press, 1982), 184. 11 Here, in a heavily glossed passage from the last page of Their Eyes Were Watching God, is Hurston's metaphor of ego concealment/camouflage and expansion/magnification, expressed more provocatively and beautifully than anywhere else in her work: "Here was peace. She pulled in her horizon like a great fish-net. Pulled it from around the waist of the world and draped it over her shoulder. So much of life in its meshes! She called in her soul to come and see," Their Eyes were Watching God (1937; reprint, Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1978), 286. References will be given parenthetically as TEWWG. 12 I intend to keep my use of the term prosopopoeia to a minimum because it can be defined much too broadly. Oliver Goldsmith, for example, once said, "the enchanting use of the prosopopoeia, [above all] is a kind of magic, by which the poet gives life and motion to every inanimate part of nature." I borrowed this quotation from Bertrand H. Bronson, "Personification Reconsidered," ELH 14 (September 1947): 170. 13 Paul de Man, "Autobiography as De-facement," Modern Language Notes, 94 (1979): 921.

All references are to this edition and will be given parenthetically asJGV. 15 This is an intimacy often noted in discussions of Hurston's second novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God, as well. "Throughout Their Eyes Were Watch- ing God," says Callahan, "Hurston works out the relationship between her voice and Janie's on grounds of cooperation and support-that condition of intimacy sought by women." See John F. Callahan, In the African-American Grain: Call-and-Response in Twentieth-Century Black Fiction (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan Univ. Press, 1988), 119. See also Gates, The Signifying Monkey, 211. 16 In other words, from a psychological view point, Amy's image of God repre- sents an act of projection which can be depicted in fiction either by using the language of prosopopoeia or by creating a personified image. But even before Amy creates her own anthropomorphic image, "God himself," as Bronson reminds us, "is himself a personification" (167).</page><page sequence="24">760 American Literature 17 Paul Ricoeur, "The Metaphorical Process as Cognition, Imagination, and Feeling," in On Metaphor, ed. Sheldon Sacks (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1978), 153. 18 Amy's activity, according to a Renaissance rhetoric, would be described as pathopoeia, "an expression of vehemente affections and perturbations," in Earl R. Wasserman's paraphrase, "whereby the passions of the mind, such as anger and hope, are personified." See Wasserman's "The Inherent Values of Eighteenth-Century Personification," PLMA 65 (1950): 441. 19 Calvin Hall and Gardner Lindzey, Theories of Personality (New York: Wiley, 1957), 139. All other references will be given parenthetically as Hall and Lindzey. Personification, however, is rarely spoken of in the same breath as projection, possibly to avoid a confusion of linguistic modes. Yet as a psycho- logical defense projection may be understood as the psychic equivalent of personification, setting personification's projective, psychic, and defensive qualities in relief. 20 Of course, we must take care: personification is a difficult convention upon which to theorize, for, like allegory, from which it is oftentimes almost indis- tinguishable, personification contains an "attractive but disturbing violence in the relation between ideal agency and empirical consciousness." At least this is what Steven Knapp believes was Coleridge's complaint against it. See Knapp's Personification and the Sublime: Milton to Coleridge (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1985), 5. 21 Later, for example, in Hurston's third novel, Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939; reprint, Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1984), "the Moses of the Old testament," as Blyden Jackson puts it in his introduction, "and the Moses of Negro myth, legend, and song are superimposed to create a new 'reading' of the Exodus Story," (back cover, emphasis mine). In this "superimposi- tion," Hurston projects both black language and black American socio-political concerns onto a Biblical tale. But inasmuch as this novel is written as an extension of black aspirations, at least as Hurston sees them, Moses offers a cast of characters in the act of personifying such black aspirations as well. Moses, for instance, is a historical/mythical symbol, but superimposed upon this symbol are the aspirations of black men made known not so much in Moses's actions as in his speech. Hurston demonstrates the flexibility of such a language and the breadth of its applicability; this demonstration is the primary significance of such a superimposition or personification of projected images. 22 Michael Awkward, Inspiriting Influences: Tradition, Revision, and Afro- American Women's Novels (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1989), 19. 23 Wasserman notes that "since personification is a vehicle for artistic commu- nication, it is, like all other vehicles, multivalent, the values depending upon the cargo the vehicle carries" (Wasserman, 436). Symbolism and allegory represent one strain of personification, while impersonation of (an)other's</page><page sequence="25">Personification in Hurston's Works 761 personality or outward characteristics and anthropomorphis describe a more theatrical manifestation of prosopopoeia. 24 Gordon E. Thompson, "The Uses of the Fantastic in the Works of Charles W. Chesnutt, Zora Neale Hurston, and Melvin B. Tolson" (Ph.D. diss., Yale University, 1987), 93-192. 25 Kimberly Benston points out: "In creating the features of his face ... by catching its reflection in some version of the other (be it racial, familial, or even psychical) the [African American] writer composes himself as a modal persona of a putative [black] culture." Benston introduces prosopopoeia here as a characteristic trope of the African American literary tradition. See Kimberly E. Benston, "Racing Tradition: Revisionary Scenes in African American Literature," PMLA 105 (January 1990): 99. 26 One must note, however, that this rhetorical flourish is, in fact, articulated by the narrator but presented as Janie's thoughts in free indirect discourse. Gates describes this phenomenon as it operates in Hurston's romance thus: "Free indirect discourse in Their Eyes reflects both the text's theme of the doubling of Janie's self and that of the problematic relationship between Janie as a speaking subject and spoken language . . . [that] serves to disrupt the reader's expectation of the necessity of the shift in point of view from third person to first" (Gates, 207, 209-10). TheirEyes is a historical memoir Janie relates to Phoebe, her best friend. Arguably, the "buzzard" tale could be conceived as an embellishment Janie creates while relating her tale to Phoebe; or contrarily, the tale could be thought of as having been created by the narrator to depict Janie's musings when she is forced to remain at home. 27 Zora Neale Hurston, Seraph on the Sewanee, (New York: Scribner's, 1948). 28 Zora Neale Hurston, Spunk, The Selected Short Stories ofZora Neale Hurston (Berkeley: Turtle Island Foundation, 1985), 38. 29 bell hooks, TalkingBack: ThinkingFeminist, ThinkingBlack (Boston: South End Press, 1989), 9. 30 These thematic associations and preoccupations are also reflected in Hurston's earliest fictions. For instance, in Their Eyes Were Watching God, the buzzard fable that Janie preoccupies herself with in response to being forced to stay at home comes quickest to mind. While the rest of the town participates in the mule's mock funeral, Janie's tale not only allows her to imagine herself transported to the site of the funeral, but it also allows her to make up a tale about personified, or at the very least, talking vultures. 31 Throughout Dust Tracks, Hurston, according to Fox-Genovese, "provides numerous clues that her primary identification, her primary sense of herself, transcends gender" (Fox-Genovese, 176). Hurston's attachment to folk tales and the recitation of folk tales goes beyond anthropological curiosity and aesthetic appreciation; investigating her commitment to the tall tale also re- veals sexual undertones that appear crucial to Hurston's continual trafficking in folk material.</page><page sequence="26">762 American Literature 32 Elsewhere, McKay says: "the events of both the private and public life are never fully explored in the autobiography . .. she constructs . .. an intel- lectual rather than an emotional self-a fully-formed philosophical self." See "Autobiographies of Hurston and Brooks" in Wild Women in the Whirlwind, ed., Joanne M. Braxton and Andree Nicola McLaughlin (New Brunswick: Rutgers Univ. Press, 1990), 275. 33 Zora Neale Hurston, "John Redding Goes to Sea," Opportunity, January 1926, 16; hereafter cited in the text as "John Redding." 34 "[P]ersonification," says Geoffrey H. Hartman, "is at least distantly related to the ritual assumption of god or ancestor via his mask." See Hartman's Be- yond Formalism: Literary Essays: 1958-1970 (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1970), 331. Hartman's statement is made in the context of Romantic poetry and the role of the pastoral. In fact, though I have had little to say about the pastoral in Hurston, any casual reader will notice her strong attachment to pastoral images. The very fact that she has characters named "Tea Cake" and "Vergible Woods," who works in the fields, is telling. But it also offers us a clue as to why Tea Cake is presented as Janie's near perfect lover and is then shot by her: Tea Cake represents for Janie the very image of love; he is a "glance from God." With Tea Cake's death, Janie "assumes" a certain god- head by taking on male attributes, permission given her by Tea Cake alone of all the people in her life. Thus, in the imaginary universe of the romance, a woman is able to effect the transfer of "gendered" attributes from a male figure to a female figure.

Stepto and Dexter Fisher (New York: Modem Language Association, 1978), 89-119. 35 See de Man, 921. 36 And this expanding drive is also expressed well in the language of personifi- cation. As Wasserman points out, "It was assumed by almost all eighteenth- century rhetoricians . . . that the artistic use of this figure [personification] effectively conveyed to the reader the passionate transport of the author." These men were not talking about physical travel. But, nevertheless, note as well the "sublime" character of personification that offers an "extension of the imagination to its farthest reaches as it strives to realize that which distends the mind or exceeds its capacity" (Wasserman, 441). 37 These ideas were clarified by my reading of a very interesting paper pre- sented at The City College of New York's American Studies Seminar in March 1992 by Fran Bartkowski (Rutgers University) entitled "Travelers v. Ethnics: Discourses of Displacement." See also Mary G. Mason, "Travel as Metaphor and Reality in Afro-American Women's Autobiography, 1850- 1972," Black American Literature Forum 24 (summer 1990): 337-56. 38 This is fortuitous in light of Kimberly Benston's reading of African Ameri- can literature as a prosopopoeic "translation into the visible of an endless procession of virtual selves" (99).</page><page sequence="27">Personification in Hurston's Works 763 39 Krasner, 117. 40 Zora Neale Hurston, Mules and Men (1935; reprint, Bloomington: Indiana Univ.
