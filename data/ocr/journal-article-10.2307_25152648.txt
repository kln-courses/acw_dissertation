Not much of it has survived or has yet come to light. Probably not a great deal was produced, particularly in stone, and it is a stone sculpture with which this article is concerned. The curious fact about early dynastic sculpture in Egypt is that it concerns itself with divine sculptures and chiefly of sacred animals with one notable exception. The art animalier produced before Dynasty I has much in common with the so called primitive arts of many regions. The sophistication of some of the most simplified forms at times seems close to the work of a modern sculptor like Brancusi. This is most readily seen in the earliest simplified egg-shaped frog of the Predynas tic Period in the Brooklyn Museum (Figure 1). It may be doubted whether these amphibians had a specific relation to a god or goddess, but we would be wrong to deny such a connec tion completely. Large-scale animal sculptures are exceedingly rare in predynastic and early dynastic times. The few extant examples of early dynastic stone sculptures are preserved in museum collections scattered throughout Eu rope and America. The alabaster hippopotamus in Copen hagen is ajoy no matter how many times one has seen it (Figure 2). The Metropolitan Museum has a quartz lion of Dynasty O-Dynasty I (ca. 3200 BC) from the Albert Gallatin Collection which has all the appeal of a puppy (Figure 3). Still another lion in black and white granite of about the same date as the Gallatin Lion, or even slightly later, is in Berlin. But it is much fiercer having more of the lion and less of the puppy. The larg est of these early sculptures is the seated ape in alabaster in East Berlin bearing the name of one of the first kings of Upper and Lower Egypt, Narmer (Figures 4 and 5). It is about twenty-one inches high. Representing the god Thoth, he sits erect with his forearms stretched so that his front paws touch the base. The subtle volumetric forms seem to suggest that we are in the presence of a divinity, and we can conjecture that this was a cult image set up on a pedestal in a temple of the First Dynasty.1 Among other major animal sculptures in stone assigned to the same period of terminal Predynastic to Early Dynastic are a hippopotamus in the Athens Museum and the falcon from the Guennol Collection in the Brooklyn Museum.2 Stone sculpture includes the exception mentioned above, the basalt door socket in the form of a bound prisoner from Hieracon polis, which is one of the treasures of the University Museum in Philadelphia. It was found in the early dynastic temple at Hieraconpolis and dates from Dynasties I or II. All these sculptures were in stone while at the same time royal sculp tures, which one would assume would rank equally high in FAR LEFT Figure 2. Hippopotamus.

Stone as a medium of royal work in the round does not appear until Dynasty II. The Cleveland Museum is now able to make a very impor tant addition to this list by way of a recent acquisition. It is of alabaster representing in frog form the goddess Heqat, the kindly deity who presided over childbirth (Figures 6-9).3 The sculpture's size and the fact that it is carved in stone imply that this figure was a cult statue. If this identification is correct, it is an understatement to say that this sculpture is a rarity, for it is really to be described as unique as a cult statue and is by far the largest sculpture known of a frog in Egyptian art.4 Although stylistic comparisons can be drawn to other early dynastic ani mal sculptures, this representation of a frog is so different from any other Egyptian rendering that the sole comparison which comes immediately to mind is absurd-she strongly suggests The Bulletin of The Cleveland Museum of Art, Volume LXIII, Number 7, September, 1976.

There are two main varieties of "frog" represented in Egyp tian art. The first is Bufo viridis-the puffed-up toad like am phibian with legs generally hidden. The second is Rana mas careniensis, a true frog-slender with a slightly elongated face. It is doubtful whether the art historian, or Egyptian craftsman for that matter, differentiates among the varieties with any semblance of accuracy. There are forms at the extremes of puffed-up obesity and emaciated slenderness, the latter with the skin stretched on the skeleton with ridges and hollows emphasized. For the purpose of this article we shall merely use the general description of "frog" without attempting to be more precise. This frog sculpture belongs to a formative stage of Egyptian art and illustrates some of the characteristics of "primitive art" in widely separate areas. For the Egyptian the annual inunda tion of the Nile, bringing the fertile silt and irrigating the fields, was the central event in his economic, social, and religious life. The height of the river was carefully recorded for comparative purposes at the several points in its course, and festivals were celebrated in honor of the inundation. The teeming river life in the papyrus swamps was represented in the reliefs and paint ing of the offering chapels of the Old, Middle, and New King dom tombs. These stock scenes included flying and alighting birds of many sorts, dragonflies, butterflies, the diverse types of fish, and the larger denizens such as the hippopotamus and crocodile, often engaged in combat, devouring their prey or 204</page><page sequence="4">even more frequently poised slyly to seize their prey. The mon goose or river cat is shown intrepidly bending the papyrus stalk as he climbs it to reach eggs in a nest. These scenes, conventional and repetitious as they may be, never cease to attract our attention.5 They serve as a needed counterpoint to the serious scenes of the chapel owner viewing his produce, the myriad activities of his farmers and offering bearers, and the ceremonies of his ritual priests. One of the smaller denizens of the swamp scenes is the frog, visually if not vocally a rather rare component of the scene (Figure 10). The frog and its intermediate stage, the tadpole, occur in the hieroglyphs; the tadpole appropriately serving as the phonetic writing for the number one hundred thousand.6 The highly visible results of the fertility of the frog may well have given rise to the role of the frog goddess Heqat as a pa troness of childbirth. Thus it happened that the female of the species rather than the male became a member of the Egyptian pantheon.7 A male frog deity does, however, occur in a rare representation in the Temple of Hibis constructed in the Khargeh Oasis under the Persian ruler Darius in Dynasty XXVII.8 The frog was not always appreciated. In Exodus Moses and Aaron, on the command of the Lord, invoked a plague of frogs to come up from the river, canals, and ponds to cover the land of Egypt. Confronted by the plague, Pharaoh agreed to let the people of Israel depart but failed to keep his word once the frogs had been killed.9 The story is also recounted in Psalm 105: He sent Moses his servant; And Aaron whom he had chosen. They showed his signs among them, And wonders in the land of Ham. He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his word. He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish. Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, In the chambers of their kings. Whether one likes frogs or not, it must be acknowledged that the frog is a strange creature to behold and one not generally praised for its beauty. The poet may compare his beloved to a rose, a fleet-footed gazelle, or a summer's day with more suc cess. Frogs seem to be more useful as something for the witch or sorcerer to transform into a fairy prince. Yet in Egypt the frog's lot in story and art is more fortunate. The great gods were associated with the animals in which they manifested themselves, and the female frog, as mentioned above, was the animal of the relatively minor goddess Heqat, while the male frog was associated with her counterpart Heqy. Votive offerings-unfortunately never inscribed, though their separate wooden bases, if such existed, may well have borne inscriptions-are almost a commonplace of archaic sites such as Abydos and Hieraconpolis, offerings of the faithful who wanted a safe and successful childbirth. For the frog was Heqat's cult form and thus most or all offerings to her were made in the likeness of a frog. But as a midwife, or in any office 205</page><page sequence="5">Figure 10. Frog in Aquatic Scene. Egypt, Sakkara, Dynasty vi. Mastaba of Mereruka. (S. Chapman after P. Duell, ed., The Mastaba of Mereruka) Figure 11. The Frog Goddess Heqat from birth colonnade, Temple of Deir el Bahari, Reign of Queen Hatshepsut, Dynasty xvIII. (S. Chapman after E. Naville, The Temple of Deir el Bahari) closely related to that function, a frog would clearly have been a most awkward and perhaps even a somewhat repulsive crea ture to have about at such a time. But with their multitude of animal and reptile deities, the Egyptians at a very early date evolved a simple and standard solution to the problem. Heqat, for representations in temple reliefs and similar depictions, was given a human body with the head of a frog, and the Egyp tians handled the union of these disparate units so well that there is no incongruity in the representation. Thus at the Tem ple of Deir el Bahri Heqat, as usual in the company of the birth-god Khnum, gently leads Queen Ahmose to the nuptial chamber where her fruitful union with Amon will take place and also is shown extending the symbol for life (Figure 11).10 In the tale of King Cheops and the Magicians the frog headed Heqat appears with the goddesses Isis, Nephthys, and Meskhenet as a sort of team of midwives who deliver the three kings.11 As each of the triplets is delivered, Isis stands at the mother's head, Nephthys at her feet, and Heqat eases the birth. The child is washed, his umbilical cord is cut, and he is placed on a square cushion. The fate-goddess Meskhenet decrees his future as an excellent king who will rule the entire land, and Khnum makes his limbs move. Heqat seems to have retained her popularity throughout dynastic times for she is represented in many of the major surviving Egyptian temples, almost always in human form with the head of a frog. Her final appearance seems to have been at the famous Temple of Philae, now about to be moved to a new site. Her cult center is known to have been at Anti noopolis in Middle Egypt where she was closely associated with Khnum, but proper excavations have never been made there nor is there much surface indication that anything sur vives underground. For the Egyptians of the later dynasties Heqat was familiar as the fifteenth square on the 30-square draughtboard, a game as popular as chess, backgammon, or checkers today, but with a didactic and religious basis.12 The frog also came to symbolize the cycle of rebirth, the hieroglyph being used as an abbreviation for the phrase, "repeating births" or "renaissance." Frog-shaped lamps in Christian Egypt are sometimes inscribed with the phrase in Greek, "I am the Resurrection." 13 The frog is also used as a vessel form as early as predynastic times.14 For cult purposes Heqat retained her original frog form. This we know from a spendid relief in the Temple of Seti I at Abydos (Figure 12).15 On one of the limestone reliefs for which that structure is so famous, Seti I offers wine in two small round jars to Heqat who is housed in a splendid portable shrine and is represented as a frog looking directly forward. She is identified by a hieroglyphic inscription as "Heqat, Mistress of the Two Lands." This relief shows very clearly that she re tained her primitive form as frog at least through Dynasty XIX. It is in this form of frog that she is represented in the Cleve land sculpture which is worked in alabaster. The frog sits erect with the long front legs firmly planted on the base; the front feet are not articulated. In most of its details this sculpture is unique. In the majority of sculptures of Heqat, early and late, the head is pointed relatively upward. Here the head and mouth areas are very rounded and compact. The severe and exaggerated deep cutting indicating the mouth gives the sculp ture a seriousness in keeping with the identity of the amphibian as a deity. The eyes are treated as bulbous knobs simplified to circles without overlapping lids. In other sculptures the eyes are frequently set in sockets protruding vertically.16 Another indication of an early date is the absence of ears. Later sculp tures of frogs invariably have pointed, upright ears. In the small carnelian pieces made as inserts of jewelry, ears and the pointed protruding head are found. 206</page><page sequence="6">Figure 12. The Goddess Heqat in her shrine at Abydos, Temple of Seti I, Dynasty xIx, upper register, center. The position of the rear legs, too, is unusual. Ordinarily the rear legs of a frog are sculptured along the lower sides of the body, but in this sculpture they are in the somewhat unnatural position of being poised at the lower back of the body.17 The rear legs are curiously tucked behind the animal parallel to the edge of the base. This is a highly exceptional placement, quite contrary to nature, and not in keeping with that of other frog sculptures. Generally the rear legs have the same type of Z curve but are always placed along the side of the body, the feet sometimes being shown on the underside, as in examples of predynastic frog vessels in Brussels and one from Hieracon polis in Oxford.18 The body itself is simplified to almost a globular mass, an unusual shape for a frog but quite hand some. The volume of the puffed-up body is emphasized by the veining of the stone. In short, every attempt was made by the sculptor to keep the work as compact as possible. Animal sculpture in Egypt is closely allied to the world of the gods. Even the smallest amulets of hares, hippopotami, and rams imply a relation to specific deities. Rare are the cases in which the animals are to be understood as independent crea tures, as may be the case of the faience gerboa mice and hedge hogs best known from the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2133-1633). In many cases there are composite creatures with an animal head and human body, a falcon with human hands, and the like. Then there are Horus falcons with elaborate regal crowns or even the tail feather crowns of anthropomorphic divini ties.19 In the study of royal and private sculpture it is now generally possible to determine the date and geographical schools responsible for their creation. Such details as the shape of the eyes, the treatment of the eyebrows and the cosmetic lines used to extend the line of the eyes, the shape of the mouth, the presence or absence of the naso-labial furrow, the piercing of the ear lobe, and the treatment of the hair or wig are among the main characteristics which enable the scholar to determine the dynasty and even the precise reign. Such criteria are as yet insufficiently studied for animal sculpture, although a begin ning has been made. The votive statuettes of frogs were always without attached bases, although they may have been furnished with separate wooden bases-but that is only a guess. Here, as a cult piece, the statue rated a base, perhaps a unique feature among early sculptures of this animal. Bases of the same piece as the sculp ture are known from the early ivories. The base has one most interesting detail. All four of its lower edges are beveled. This must be one of the earliest, perhaps the earliest, example of a technique very widely used on hard stone sculptures of the i :...... ..... all, this technique ,.... , .,. e .tOld Kingdom, we do not. know. The Cleveland Heqat differs in many respects from the form of the various types of frog sculpture of the Predynastic and Early Dynastic Period: the egg-shaped, simplified figures rep resented in the Brooklyn Museum, the oval stone vessels with a mouth with rim on the top, and the naturalistic frogs with a clearly defined projecting head tapering to the front exempli fied by the large-scale and partly restored Spencer-Churchill frog now in the British Museum.20 In view of the association of Heqat with Abydos and the prominence of this site in the Early Dynastic Period, one might suggest that the new acquisition derives from the temple area there. Several of the early frog sculptures are said to have come from Abydos, and Heqat figures prominently in the offering texts of the Middle Kingdom from the site.21 Heqat is frequent ly paired in the texts with Khnum and is enlisted as an interces sor in the deceased man's resurrection.

To this day the women of the villages near Abydos come to the temple area to visit the remains of the fallen statues in order to seek magical assis tance in achieving fertility. The monumental and austere aspect of the Cleveland Heqat can be contrasted with a much later frog of about Dynasty XXVI (664-525) on the lid of a compartmented, faience cir cular box in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (Figure 13).22 In this case the frog is placed with its head low, its front legs poised as if to spring, and the feet splayed forward. About 2,500 years separate the Cleveland frog from the frog on the lid of the cosmetic box. A curious and hard to explain feature of this sculpture, one apparent in Figure 14, is that it is hollow, and Egyptian stone sculptures were never hollow. Cyril Aldred first suggested the possibility that the Egyptians had found this piece of alabaster in its hollow state, a lusus naturae, and, assuming that it had magical properties, made use of it. This was carefully studied by Mary Flahive, the geologist of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, who suggested that such a formation could, of course, be a stalagmite or stalactite and would show layered deposits typical of this sedimentary formation. Of course the Egyptians had no knowledge of them. On the other hand Abe Rosensweig of the Oberlin College Art Laboratory after care ful examination believes that in modem times the opening was cut out deliberately and then treated with acid. The only pur pose in making an opening of this sort, a fairly common prac tice in present-day Egypt, is to insert a light within the sulpture to give it a spectacular effect. This has been done on a grand scale in a small building at Sakkara where a large number of alabaster vessels from the Step Pyramid stand on shelves with electric lights within them. The result, rather startling, is not in sympathy with Western tastes. The sculpture is said to have been in a known collection, a fact which may or may not be true, but the hollowing would tend to confirm this. Nothing is known of its provenance, and it can only be surmised that it probably comes from the Abydos area. The frog is a most impressive tribute to the art of the begin ning of the Dynastic Period. Its monumentality is not ade quately reflected in its dimensions nor readily apparent in photographs, yet it shares a feeling of mysterious presence with its closest parallel, the Berlin ape of Narmer (Figures 4 and 5). The latter belongs to the reign of one of the first rulers of Dynasty I, and it seems logical to place the Cleveland frog at approximately the same time, the period of the last predynastic rulers now generally grouped as Dynasty 0 or the first part of Dynasty I. Both sculptures are placed on rectangular bases. For the final word on the date and place in the history of Egyp tian art of this sculpture, we must wait for another generation or two. JOHN D.
