Edge-Partington. j7 Some two or three years ago a collection from the Admiralty group andl the islands to the west was disposed of in London. I was fortunate in procuring three lime spatulas, reproduced herewith, which I think are worth noting on account of the spiral ornament containied in their elaborately-carved handles. For some time past the origin of this particular form of ornamenit has been occupying the attention of ethnologists, and several notes on the subject have already appeared (Journ. Anthr. Inst., Vol. XXIX., p. 305; Vol. XXX. (Miscellanea, Nos. 40, 41); MAN, 1901. 55). I cannot, however, agree with Professor Haddon that the scroll pattern can be derived from the F'rigate bird, whose long, straight tail-feathers could hardly suggest such a design. I still adhere to the lizard or snalke idea, and this has been confirmed by a note that I have just received as to the existence in New Zealand of wvater-sniakes at all events. The figures above show how easily such a scroll as that, so commnonly produced by Maori carvers, might have been derived fronm the coiled tail of a lizard. The spatulas in my possession are closely allied to those from the Anchorite Islands figured by Dr. F. Grabowsky in the Internationales Archiv fuir Ethnographie, Vol. VII. (1894), P1. XIV., Figs. 10, 14, and 1.5, but they are not so highly conventionalised. They tend to prove that the scrolls are not connected with the anthropomorphic design from which other examples figiured by Dr. Grabowsky are derived, but to an independent motive of which the 1lzard is the original type.
