<plain_text><page sequence="1">conference BRINGING THE PAST INTO THE PRESENT AAA 104th Annual Meeting, Washington, DC, December 2005 What an impact space has upon the spirit of an event. Take for instance the 2003 AAA Annual Meeting, held at the New Orleans Hilton, in the Convention Center where all the rooms were arranged around an enormous hollow tower. Just by looking up from the level of the bar and restaurant, one could easily spot session venues along with all the AAA parties taking place on various floors. No such luck at the Washington Marriott. You would be sprinting blindly through a labyrinth of atria, corridors, foyers and escalators, in the hope of reaching Coolidge, Kennedy or Eisenhower, only to find the Health Club ominously blocking the way. Detailed architectural plans printed in miniature made little difference. The Wardman Park Marriott brought a sense of baf- flement, too, at the seemingly endless diversity and diversification of what 'anthropology' means. I noticed a panel devoted to teaching anthropology, including such diverse topics as 'success at teaching about chimpanzee bipedalism, applied archaeology via research posters, and analysing body part idioms'. Yet this year's conference was particularly memorable. America's reckless foreign policy, Katrina's disastrous aftermath, a growing sense of alarm fostered by a string of disas- ters in the preceding months, became vividly interwoven in the fabric of discussions, papers and informal conversations. The ground itself seemed to be shifting under our feet, a feeling echoed by the imagery of motion present in the titles of many panels: 'shifting spaces', 'webs', 'flows', 'transitions' were abundant, with 'stasis' as the negative term (for example, the 'stasis' of certain understandings of culture). This focus on movement was also evident in the formulation of the meeting's main theme, 'Bringing the Past into the Present', and its agenda 'to explore and identify pressures, forces and conditions that shape human lives, and to trace human history and society as lega- cies, continuities, interconnections and trans- formations'. Unsurprisingly, given this remit, topics such as violence, victimhood, truth, sci- ence and technology and environmental issues, media and globalization were well represented, with a single panel touchingly devoted to hope ('if anthropology can be regarded as a hopeful practice, what does it mean to propose hope as a subject of anthropological analysis?' asked the organizers). For many of the participants I spoke with, the restlessness seemed linked to an aware- ness of our - and the discipline's - duty to speak to the important historical shifts we are witnessing and make ourselves heard beyond the confines of the academic ivory tower. Such concerns surfaced in several panels devoted to exploring the implications of US imperialism, and the debates were occasionally intense - as with the much whispered-about argument between Ann Stoler and David Harvey. This invited session, entitled 'American empire: Problems with a world power, problems to come', turned the spotlight on the relative decline of US global hegemony, its military backlash, and the rise of alternative world powers. What made it remarkable was the fact ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY VOL 22 NO 2, APRIL 2006 23</page><page sequence="2">that the stellar cast of participants focused boldly on the 'macro'-trends visible at this historical juncture, and their implications. From Jonathan Friedman's vision of history repeating itself in the dynamics of global imperial systems, Ann Stoler's view of 'impe- rial formations' as 'forcefields with structures of domination', to Fernando Coronil's view of capitalism and imperialism as twin forces in the creation of a world market and Harvey's discussion of how the turn towards neo-liber- alism has altered the US's historically specific imperial tradition, this was an exciting depar- ture from anthropology's sometimes con- straining obsession with the 'micro'. The global spread of neo-liberalism has also engendered new rapprochements between for- merly segregated sub-areas of anthropology. Anthropologists of post-socialist states world- wide are engaged in documenting the political and economic reforms that have followed the collapse of socialism. There is a cross-pollina- tion between post-socialist and post-colonial studies. This year, post-socialist panels brought together papers dealing with a greater variety of settings than at past conferences (usually focused on Eurasia), although the comparisons could be widened further still. For instance, the panel 'Disentangling socialism' brought together papers on Korea, Cuba, Romania, Ukraine and the Italian left, and a panel on 'State, power, and authority in Asia' combined papers on subjectivity in Tibet, privatization in South Korea, Japanese civil society, and policing memory in China. At the same time, a growing unease con- cerning the 'post-socialist' label prompted calls for a rethinking of what, if anything, post-socialist states in different parts of the world still have in common, apart from a label denoting an absence. In the panel 'Non- postsocialism: Socialism, presentness and the naming of the past', these concerns were somewhat overshadowed by M. Buchowski's final paper, which charged Western-trained anthropologists working in formerly socialist states with ignoring the work of their 'native' colleagues, and 'reproducing a hierarchical division that privileges the anthropology of Westerners as more authentic and legitimate'. This debate is not new, and it seems set to persist partly because of the fact that anthro- pology is new to the academic curriculum in most post-socialist states. It is good to question the hidden politics of knowledge, but efforts towards fruitful collaboration and dialogue are equally worthy of notice. In Romania, the country with which I am best acquainted, gifted Romanian students receive their best training increasingly through collaborative projects between Romanian and Western scholars. The role of anthropology and anthro- pologists in the changing landscape of the American university campus was also a prominent theme, with some interestingly titled panels such as 'How to survive evo- lutionary events in academia: Extinction vs. new niches'. Several panels touched upon the issue of recruitment by security agencies and funding of anthropology students covered in past issues of AT: these included the panel on the present relevance of World War II anthropology organized by David Price and a panel on the hidden agenda behind some calls for academic freedom, which referred to the hounding of particular academics in institutions that responded to concerted media pressure campaigns also targeted at compa- nies involved in funding universities. A panel was devoted to Kennewick Man (whose skeleton was recently released for scientific study despite the federal government's desire to surrender it to Native Americans claiming him as an ancestor), while another panel, including a Yanomami discussant, was devoted to 'Placing ethics at the discipline's center'. I also glimpsed Napoleon Chagnon conversing under the shadow of a large microphone held by a Brazilian documentary film crew. The AAA Public Policy Forum on Organized Labor brought together union representatives, lawyers and anthropologists studying the US labour movement and those interested in dis- cussing issues confronting the unions, their strategies, and legislative agendas. With the San Francisco Hilton labour dispute remaining unresolved, next year's meeting will be held in San Jose. The tone of this meeting struck me as unusually serious, even for the AAA. Talks were almost always fully scripted and read out, self-deprecating jokes during a botched presentation fell on deaf ears. After five long days, participants filtered into the strangely grand and deserted city to visit the Holocaust museum. In the snow and sleet, the city itself seemed an enormous memorial park for a decaying empire. Alice Forbess Goldsmiths College ans02af@gold.ac.uk With special thanks to Annu Jalais. Possibly prompted by jet lag and rather too much coffee, I was inspired to calculate the scale of the AAA event as follows: how long would it have taken one person, working nine to five, to attend all the panels which were presented during the 104th Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological Association? The answer, according to my estimate, is around six months - with weekends off, but no holidays. Before I plunge into vignette, anthro- pology's tested way of dealing with too much information, let us see what structural ele- ments can be extracted from the topic index of the conference programme. There are about nine hundred topics listed in the index, which makes it a virtually useless reference guide.' Even so, it stands as a mark of the popularity of some words over others. This year's prize- winner, 'globalization', was a keyword for 26 panels ('economy' by contrast, came up with one). Hot on globalization's heels came 'iden- tity' (24 panels), and then the old reliables gender (20) and religion (19). Far from these well-trodden grounds, I still had to elbow and apologize my way through a dense standing crowd, on the afternoon of the Thursday, to attend a panel on 'Ethnographic fictions' convened by Susan Coutin, Barbara Yngvesson and Bill Maurer. While to the unwary its title might have suggested a rerun of 1980s concerns on the theory of ethnog- raphy, the panel was in fact geared, to borrow the subtitle of Annelise Riles' paper, towards 'an ethnography of theory'. While Riles' paper offered a subtle exploration of 'as if' fictions in recent legal theory and their potential for rethinking anthropological knowledge prac- tices beyond issues of representation, Tony Crook's account of the personal and theoretical menage a trois between Margaret Mead, Gregory Bateson and Reo Fortune transcended accepted notions of 'biographical context'; indeed, with its brilliant use of innuendo and double entendre, Crook's paper exhibited in condensed form a notable strength of the panel as a whole, and one which one had almost given up hoping for in the context of the AAA: fun. Earlier that day an invited session on 'The ethnography of academic life', convened by Donald Brenneis and Dominic Boyer, showed that the practice of studying not so much 'up' as 'in' (audit, professional ethics and the academy) is gaining momentum. Taken together with the aforementioned panel's 'ethnography of theory', these 'ethnographies of the academy', seemed to confirm the more general shift whereby 'ethnography' has increasingly come to denote a type of sensi- bility rather than a set of methodologies. It is not entirely clear, for instance, what the label 'ethnographic' added to Rena Lederman's excellent and informative account of multi- disciplinary ethics committees. This paper, alongside Mary Huber and Dominic Boyer's very different approaches to the issue of professionalism, worked in fact quite well to unsettle the notion of 'the ethnographic', rather than being unified by it. These two very different panels drove home the point that the only way to think ethnography may be to constantly rethink it. Attention to the changing nature of anthro- pological fieldwork, can, as George Marcus argued in his opening paper, help us reframe encounters within the academy. This kind of attention is also key if we want to avoid the designation 'ethnography of...' becoming a mere shibboleth of anthropological belonging in such encounters. On Friday I went on a quest for identity. The first panel I attended, Deborah Reed-Danahay and Caroline Brettell's double session 'Immigrants and the practice of "citizen- ship": Perspectives from Europe and the US', provided a series of fascinating case studies ranging from the nascent political mobilization of Latin Americans in the UK (Davide Pero) to the Chinese 'high-tech community' in Silicon Valley (Bernard Wong). Paul Silverstein and Robert Gibb's contributions on France pro- vided complex analyses of various political modes of expression and action among French minorities, which had accrued relevance in the context of the recent French riots - a phenom- enon which had by then received considerable coverage in the US, as it has in Britain. While Silverstein explored the associative 'politics 24 ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY VOL 22 NO 2, APRIL 2006</page><page sequence="3">without politics' through which Franco- Maghrebian groups resisted what he felt was the 'racism without races' of French citizen- ship practices, Gibb provided a fine-grained but far-ranging critique of the anti-racist movement 'SOS Racisme' which, he argued, by calling for a generational mobilization against racism, undercut the possibility for eth- nicity-based collective action, and promoted a 'republican nationalist concept of citizenship'. As on the previous day, what fascinated me was the extent to which this panel talked to, and talked past, one I attended in the after- noon: Carolyn Rouse and Loic Wacquant's 'Disrupting race', an exploration of American politics of race. From the start, this panel's tone and feel were radically different from the rather quietly confident one I had heard in the momrning. As I sat down in the lecture hall in which about two-thirds of the audience and speakers were African American, chair Lee Baker walked through the ranks distributing a photocopied sheet which listed the 10 public figures who had most 'damaged the interests of the white race'. This list was drawn, Baker explained, from a recent issue of an American white supremacist publication, and he pointed out to us the third name on the list, that of anthropologist Franz Boas. His paper 'Franz Boas and the conspiracy to destroy the white race' recalled early cultural anthropology's involvement in anti-racism, seen through the unusual prism of 1960s white supremacists' vilification of the discipline's founder. Lanita Jacobs-Huey offered a fascinating paper focused on the enactment and subversion of stereotypes of hardness in post-9/11 African American standup. The video clips of various sketches elicited mixed responses, from frank laughter to more guarded titters, as the place of race in the discourse of American unity in vic- timhood was questioned and debated through comedy ('I thought some of those jokes were in such bad taste,' said an American fellow audience member to me a few days later). Beyond the immediate implication of and challenges to the audience, this panel also engaged subtly and directly with competing paradigms in the study of identity. While Jacobs-Huey's paper suggested that the anti- essentialist lambasting of identity politics needed to be rethought and the importance of authenticity recaptured, John Jackson stuck to his anti-essentialist guns, but suggested the introduction of the question of sincerity as a corrective to concerns about authenticity. The result was not consensus, but a fruitful and fascinating debate, at times uncomfortable but always good-humoured and sincere. This panel highlighted, by contrast, the relatively consensual nature of the one I had attended in the morning. Perhaps the greater space for debate was created (as Carolyn Rouse suggested in her abstract) by the progress of race politics in the US since the 1960s. As Emma Tarlo's recent piece on the jilbab controversy has shown (AT 22[1]), many feel that issues of citizenship in Europe are still at a stage where debate and com- plexity seem dubious political options. And yet Tarlo's article, among others, suggests that the search for complexity in the troubled ethical, intellectual and political waters of European citizenship debates may be a form of engage- ment in itself. A similar point can be made about the conference as a whole. I have often heard the complaint from participants and non-partici- pants that the sheer size of the event, but also the lack of plenaries and the super-accommo- dating theme (this year 'Bringing the Past into the Present' - add the future and we have a full temporal sweep) precludes not only a truly unified focus, but even a single well-delineated set of issues. The result is an anthropology splintered into 900 topics. And yet, as my experience suggests, it is often when panels talk past each other that they produce most light.

Historical Perspectives on Anthropology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: Panel discussion, American Anthropological Association Annual Meeting 2005 [Note: This review complements Steven E. Dick's article on pp. 3-7 of this issue - Ed.] A well-known, if hackneyed, heuristic for cultural analysis starts like this: 'Take the per- spective of a Martian anthropologist...'. Social scientists invoke the quirky appeal of the non-human alien to encourage their students and audiences to take a more self-conscious position vis-at-vis the exotic or the familiar, in order to broaden and sharpen their anthropo- logical imagination. However, the corollary of this heuristic exercise - picturing the human encounter with this alien - is not just a thought problem. For some scientists and scholars, it is serious everyday work. In 2005, for the third time in its history, the American Anthropological Association Annual Meeting featured a session on 'SETI', the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The SETI acronym is often used as a shorthand reference to the SETI Institute, a California research facility commonly depicted as the intellectual and social hub of the search. However, in general, as during the presen- tations at this panel, the term refers to the coordinated astronomical, astrobiological and social scientific activities that formally define and advance that search. In keeping with the AAA meeting's historical theme, the speakers represented and discussed anthropology's input into SETI activities over the years. Chaired by Douglas Vakoch, a social scientist at the SETI Institute, the panel introduced its audience to a distinctive facet of the social sci- entific imaginary in action. The first paper, by NASA Chief Historian Steven Dick (which appears in this issue of AT) gave an account of the steady but unsys- tematic flow of contributions made to SETI by anthropologists, as expert modellers of cultural evolution, cultural diffusion and cross-cultural exchange. These key features of anthropolo- gy's original theoretical and political founda- tions take on a new cast when 'the local' is reconfigured on a planetary scale. In detailing the social scientific role in imagining a 'mul- ticultural universe', this paper follows Dick's previous analysis of the historical debates about the existence of a 'biological universe'. He argues there that to believe or not believe that life, or culture, may exist elsewhere is not epistemologically trivial. In fact, leaving aside speculation about the existence of other non- human societies, human societies are already being reshaped by their own extraterrestrial activities in ways that are still not well under- stood by social scientists. Dick suggests that we are in a good position now to take an ana- lytical 'extraterrestrial perspective' to reveal a variety of unexamined cosmological assump- tions across human cultures (Dick 1999: 554). Such an analysis could be put to several uses, such as refining SETI techniques or pursuing more unified knowledge production, which certainly wouldn't appeal to all social scientists. However, it is important to note that Dick's position aligns with that of science studies scholars and actor network theorists, who, following the work of Bruno Latour and Michel Callon, displace the human from the centre of their enquiries in order to expose and collapse artificial divisions between nature and society. Dick submits that the 'terrestrial' and 'extraterrestrial' division is equally taken for granted and that it marks a conceptual and ana- lytical frontier that can usefully be explored. Following Dick's historical overview, Reed Riner, a social/cultural anthropologist at Northemrn Arizona University, described the CONTACT conference, a multidisciplinary human/alien encounter simulation that has been funded by NASA and the Smithsonian Institution and is now entering its 23rd year. Inspired by his studies with reknowned poly- math anthropologist Gregory Bateson, the project's designer, Jim Funaro, originally described it as a 'Bateson experiment'. The simulations have built up elaborate alien and human environmental and sociocultural 'ecologies' that frame role-playing adven- tures for participants from the NASA, space science, social science, science fiction and education communities. Giving an account of a sample ethnographic vignette from an early CONTACT Conference, Riner described how this successful inter-species contact simulation demonstrated the value of synthetic problem- solving and ethnographic over military tactics, thus showing how SETI projects cross over with applied anthropology. The CONTACT project gives weight to ongoing scholarly reas- sessments of the image of the ET alien and of human/alien encounters by bringing them out of the realm of popular culture and into the mainstream worlds of scientific simulation, public policy development and government planning practices. Following Riner's presentation, anthropolo- gist Garry Chick provided a step-by-step recal- ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY VOL 22 NO 2, APRIL 2006 25</page><page sequence="4">culation of a value for the 'Drake Equation' (see p. 5 of this issue), the controversial math- ematical formula for estimating the number of advanced extraterrestrial societies in our galaxy that are capable of interstellar commu- nication. The equation symbolizes SETI's sci- entific ambitions but also suggests an avenue for disputing its scientific value, since its long string of variables represents both verifiable and completely speculative computations. Since new astronomical techniques are adding empirical weight to estimates of the equation's first several variables, including the number of solar systems with planets, Chick has reworked estimates for the last two 'fuzzier' variables, the number of planets with intelli- gent life and the number of cultures with radio transmission capability. Using the percentage of intelligent technology-producing animal species on earth as a basis, he calculated a new possible galactic percentage of similar off- world species. In doing so, he pointed out the equation's inherent anthropomorphism, noting that the formula rejects any consideration of hive or group forms of intelligence. His final calculation was a value drastically lower than a recent re-estimate by Drake himself. However, Chick averred that his number didn't satisfy him, thus highlighting the emotional persist- ence that stimulates SETI, despite the relent- less silence from space. Cognitive anthropologist Paul Wason then argued that the human prehistoric record offers fruitful ways to think about the consequences of biocultural discord between humans and ETs. SETI is, he reminded us, a field without data, hobbled by the tricky first task of iden- tifying what is and isn't evidence. He then reviewed some of the problems archaeolo- gists have had in reconstructing Neanderthal culture and what count as its artefacts, and advised that evidence of dramatic differences in Neanderthal and modern human mentali- ties can help us anticipate perceptual obstacles we might encounter as we try to recognize the signs, behaviours and material culture of extraterrestrials. He called for a better under- standing of the varieties of prehistoric and modern human intelligence, which would in turn help SETI participants detect non-human forms of intelligence. Time constraints meant that Douglas Vakoch was limited to distributing copies of his paper, coauthored with psychologist Kailash Tuli, on the portrayal of Indian cultures in the audio recordings included in the NASA Voyager probe. Vakoch and Tuli discuss the limited representation of India's cultural diversity in the pictorial and sound artefacts that were included in the Voyager capsule. However, they also examined how the ten Indic inter- stellar greetings collected for inclusion com- municate different senses of spatial distance between the senders and their imagined recipi- ents. Some greetings imply that ETs are far away, some that they are near; one even invites them 'home'. Their analysis thus used a SETI project as a tool for cultural critique, as well as a vehicle for a linguistic analysis of human cosmological perceptions. The panellists acknowledged that SETI activities and passion, with the exception of this last collaborative paper, are centred in the US; however, none commented directly on what this might mean for the way SETI goals and practices are framed. All of these presenta- tions also expressed in some way American anthropology's early commitment to refining the culture concept and ideas of what it means to be human, through a holistic synthesis of knowledge. This may explain why none of the papers exhibited a critical perspective on SETI's construction and use of the very idea of culture, nor of the assumptions inherent in projecting that construct into the cosmos. Nevertheless, the presentations did show how the SETI vision of a terrestrial/extraterrestrial dichotomy between human and alien 'others' brings older and recent anthropological ideas into a new juxtaposition. However, the lack of empirical evidence to characterize this imag- ined human/ET dichotomy makes clear, as Dick observes, both the opportunities and the dangers of analogical imagining. Even if the SETI search per se seems irrel- evant to anthropology's central concerns, this panel provoked its audience into considering two practical questions that arise from taking the earthling's extraterrestrial perspective: how SETI activities are enriching the anthro- pological imagination in general, and to what extent anthropologists are actively considering the impact of the expanding human presence in space on contemporary societies. * Valerie A.
