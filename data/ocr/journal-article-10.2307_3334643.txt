<plain_text><page sequence="1">Traditional Bijago Statl ROBERT C. HELMHOLZ ijago' statuary from Guinea Bissau is relatively unknown and unappreciated among many foreign observers, perhaps because most pieces collected during the early part of this century and occasionally photographed for publication seem to be of a com- mercial nature. They portray European administra- tors, soldiers, canoes under paddle, bowls, etc.2'3'4'5 Many such objects were displayed in Bissau in 1946 at an exposition celebrating the fifth centennial of the discovery of Portuguese Guinea, and were possibly even commissioned by the Portuguese.6 These statues possess none of the abstract qualities of Bijago func- tional (in a socio-magico-religious sense) statuary. Reference to the Bijago worship of statues was apparently first made by Cadamosto in his account of the voyage-of Pedro de Cintra circa 1460.7 Periodic mention of the religious practices among the Bijago was made by subsequent narrators; however, it ap- pears that no systematic inquiry has yet been made into the function of traditional statuary in Bijago so- ciety. Portuguese ethnographers have only begun to study the significance of Bijago traditional wood sculp- ture within the past few years. Their work, unfortun- ately, has been limited by a lack of funds, and to date, much of the fragmentary, conflicting data supplied by early Bissagos Islands visitors remain unchallenged. That wooden statues exist in Bijago society for various socio-religious purposes was firmly established, however, by Hugo Bernatzik in 1933. Photographs of such statues in situ are published in his book, Athiopen de Westens. Bernatzik collected a few of them (together with some of the more commercially sculptured pieces), but only recently have the tradi- tional carvings begun to make their way to the market- place and foreign attention. In addition to Bernatzik, another reference is avail- able. In 1947, Augusto J. Santos Lima, a Portuguese colonial administrator, wrote Organizaado Economica e Social Dos Bijagos. In this study, there are frequent references to Bijago customs and the associated use of statuary. I have here attempted to synthesize these and other contributions relative to the function of tradi- tional Bijago statuary. It must be kept in mind that the Bijago are one of the least documented tribes in West 52 1. HEAD ON CYLINDRICAL BASE. WOOD WITH ALUMINUM PIECES NAILED AS EYES, ENCRUSTATION WITH TRACES OF EGGSHELLS, 17". Africa. What follows is not free from internal con- tradiction and inconsistency. It does, however, represent a reasonably complete reporting of what has been written to date, as well as some observations based on a review of almost 200 examples of Bijago traditional statuary. The Bijago constitute a relatively small West African tribe numbering approximately 22,000.8 They inhabit most of the 25 Bissagos Islands, lying off the coast of the capital city of Bissau, which form a part of the Portuguese colony of Guine (Guinea Bissau). Each Bijago is said to have descended from one of four legendary families: Oracuma, Oraga, Ogubane, and Ominca. All descendants of the same legendary family are said to belong to the same "Generation" or lineage. A "Generation" is the vertical linking and com- munality of all descendants including the original members of one of the four original families. Member- ship in a particular "Generation" is determined by uterine parentage. An age-grade system also exists, and is a sort of horizontal division limited to persons of a particular age, apparently determined in relation to the occurrence of the last ceremony peculiar to that particular age-grade. The notion of "Generation" influences the succession of rulers, the use of statues as links between the living and deceased members, and the proprietorship of property in the sense that land belongs to the founding "Generation" of a par- ticular locale. Most islands are populated by members of several "Generations". Each grouping of members of the same "Generation" on an island by island basis (probably village by village) is represented by a chief, chosen by the elders of that village. On three islands, however, ALL OBJECTS FROM THE AUTHOR'S COLLECTION</page><page sequence="2">(Bubaque, Roxa, and Orango Grande), a particular "Generation" is ruled by a king who inherits his posi- tion in a manner which is not well documented. The basic political differences between a king and a chief are that the king inherits his position while a chief is chosen; the land in a kingdom "belongs" to the king as the hereditary representative of the "Generation" while the land in a chiefdom belongs to all members of the "Generation". The power to administer land is delegated to the chief by the people, while a king administers through divine right. A chief or king always comes from the founding "Generation" of the area (called the "Soil Generation"). This "Soil Genera- tion" refers to the descendants and the original settlers of a particular locale (not necessarily an entire island). A council of elders, called the Grandeza, advises the king or chief on important matters. How or why kingdoms developed on some islands in certain "Generations" is not documented. Among the Bijago, there are two types of priests. One, a female, is called Oquinca; she interprets the designs of the Supreme Being, Orrebuco Ocoto, and normally exercises her functions in a kind of shrine called a Candjamo. The Oquinca has a primary func- tion of appeasing the potential angers of the Iras of the "Soil Generation". The Ira is described as a statue- repository for the soul of an ancestor. The Oquinca is named by the king or chief and is frequently chosen from the royal "Generation"-perhaps to preserve a close union between Church and State! She may temporarily replace a deceased king until a new king is installed. Perhaps because of this, the Bijago have been referred to as the matriarchal society. According to observers, however, women are excluded from a permanent position of rule. There are no queens among the Bijago. The other type of priest, called Oamcandjamo, is always a male. He frequently acts as a sort of diviner, and also presides over the series of initiations through which young boys and girls pass on their way to recognized adulthood. In addition to their traditional statuary, the Bijago are known for carving a wide variety of wooden objects: commercial figures, spoons, bowls, stools, dolls (carved with forked legs and carried about the waist by women), pirogue prow decorations (in the form of a huge bovine head), drums, staffs, ax handles, and masks (frequently, but not always, in a helmet style representing the head of a bull).9 Bijago statuary is described as functioning in at least two different capacities: as the repository for a soul of an ancestor (who may be communicated with); and as the medium through which the Supreme Being (Orrebuco-Ocoto) is consulted (usually in sorcery- LEFT TO RIGHT: 2.

The powers sought through the ceremonial use of these statues are related to crop increase or agrarian fertility, marital blessing, and divination. Santos Lima and Bernatzik describe some of these uses as follows: The personal acquisition of land. Land belongs to the "Soil Generation". A person wishing to work a parcel of land must address himself to the representative of the "Soil Generation" -the village chief. The chief asks the applicant to procure a chicken or a goat (depending upon the size of the plot desired) for sacrifice. Next, the chief addresses the Oamcandjamo of the "Generation" of the ap- plicant, and arranges for a ceremony to be celebrated in honor of the deceased members of the "Soil Genera- tion" in order that they may approve the proposed use of the land and insure a good harvest. The Oam- candjamo celebrates the ceremony by sacrificing the animal and pouring its blood on the Ira, after which the applicant may begin to prepare the ground for seeding. The ceremony is repeated in the presence of the same persons at the time of seeding and at the time of harvest. During the harvest, the Ira stays on the ground in the plot of land being worked. After the harvest, the new tenant must gather a quantity of the harvested product and follow the Oamcandjamo while he returns the Ira to the Candjamo. Once inside the Candjamo, he leaves the offering in front of the Ira and says: "I have come to thank you, deceased one." Weddings. In general, it is the wife who chooses her husband. The proposal of marriage is made by offering the prospective groom a favorite dish, usually of prepared rice. If he accepts the proffered dish, he symbolically accepts marriage. The ceremony takes place in the presence of the two families, the king or chief, the Oquinca, and the Orrebuco images belong- ing to the two families. The ceremony is not described in any detail by Santos Lima. Sickbed vigilfor dying persons. When a sick person is apparently incurable, he is laid upon mats stretched on the ground inside his hut. The Oquinca, in the presence of the king or chief and the Oamcandjamo, places the Iras at the feet of the invalid and sacrifices a chicken in an effort to determine if the sick person may be cured or will succumb, and to know who is injuring the patient. When the invalid dies, the Oquinca performs an undefined religious ceremony in the presence only of the king or chief and the de- ceased. Certain ritual washings and body preparations are then conducted to prepare the deceased for burial. A final ceremony is conducted by both priests. This last ceremony occurs in front of the altar where the Iras are kept, and has as its purpose the interrogation of the deceased through the Iras to determine if the deceased may have died as a result of the magical workings of a sorcerer. If sorcery is suspected, the determination of the guilt of a particular person is decided through the process described below. Determination of guilt in a condemnation of sorcery. 54</page><page sequence="4">Perhaps the worst event for a Bijago is to be accused of sorcery. If so accused, he is obliged to hang himself. Only afterwards does his family ask the king or chief to locate the Oquinca, who performs a last ceremony to the attention of Orrebuco-Ocoto, who functions in this instance as a court of last resort and declares whether the deceased was, in fact, a sorcerer or not. The Oquinca holds the body of a red chicken, and the chief, holding the chicken's head, addresses the Ira: "I beg you, have patience; if you see that the deceased is a sorcerer, let the chicken go toward the bush. And if he is not a sorcerer, let the chicken come to rest near you." Immediately following these words, the chief cuts off the head of the chicken and the Oquinca lets the body fall to the ground where its muscular contractions carry the bird a short distance. If, after the movement of the chicken stops, the body comes to rest near the Ira, the deceased is recognized as not having been a sorcerer and he is given, as a last com- pensation, a tomb in a hut; just as mortals live in a hut. If the chicken's body comes to rest in the direction of the bush, the deceased is recognized as having been a sorcerer and he must be buried in the untamed wilder- ness, away from all other graves. The point of the ceremony is to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. The accused does not benefit from a finding of innocence, but the accuser would then stand "trial" in a separate inquiry as a prevaricator. The penalty would be death. Confirmation of the selection of a village chief. Once a man has been chosen by the elders as the next village chief, the nominated chief and the elders proceed to the Candjamo, where a chicken is sacrificed. The chicken is offered by the brother of the nominee to the ancestors of the original "family" from which descends the population (i.e., to the ancestors of the "Generation" of the nominee). When the Oquinca cuts the chicken's throat, all persons present watch to see where the muscular spasms of the dead chicken will carry it. If the chicken falls in front of the Ira, it is a sign that the ancestors do not approve of the choice of the village elders for the future chief, and another person must be chosen followed by the same cere- mony. If the body of the chicken falls near the chosen man or nearer to him than to the Ira, it is a sign that the Ira approves of the choice. At this moment, the new chief assumes his rights and privileges of office. Condemnation of sexual indiscretion. If an un- married woman is accused of having permitted herself to be seduced by a boy still undergoing the series of initiations and trial periods required to achieve ac- ceptance as a "full" man, she is convoked before the village elders (Grandeza). A chain is attached to her neck and an Ira is placed upon her head. One of the elders takes the chain, and with the girl in front and all the elders following, visits all the Candjamos in the village where the girl, kneeling and bending over so that the Ira touches the ground, is given one or two LEFT TO RIGHT: 8.

At the comple- tion of this punishment, the group returns to the meet- ing place of the elders, and the young man in question, and all his male friends, are sentenced to stay fourteen days within the meeting place of the Grandeza with the obligation of serving food and drink to the elders, and submitting to physical punishment by the elders. At the end of this period, the boy and girl are married by the chief. The resolution of civil feuds. In earlier days, per- sonal vengeance was commonplace. This vengeance was normally meted out to the perpetrator of the in- fraction, or when he could not be found, to his close family members. With time, the rule of vengeance was altered in such a manner that justice is now delivered by the council of elders (Grandeza). The council meets and calls before it the accused and the accuser (in case of the death of either, the close family members). They are placed opposite each other, and at equal distance from the Ira. Each one, holding a chicken, is invited to recount his side of the dispute. Next, the priest and the village chief decapitate the two chickens next to the Ira. The following hypothetical situations may result: the two bodies of the chickens come to rest near one or the other rival, in which case the guilty party is he near whom the chicken bodies come to rest; the two bodies of the chickens come to rest near the Ira, in which'case both rivals are justified; or the body of one chicken comes to rest near one or the other rival, in which case both rivals have omitted a portion of the motivation which moved them to dis- pute. (Obviously, other combinations seem possible, but Santos Lima does not comment on them.) In all of the above situations, an indemnity is paid: in the case of the first example, by the guilty party; in the case of the second example, by both plaintiffs, and in equal amounts since both parties lost the judgement; and in the case of the third example, chickens are again offered for as many additional ceremonies as are required to "resolve" the dispute. Should the repeated ceremonies not result in an unequivocal resolution, a special ceremony is con- ducted: two small calabashes, each belonging to the respective plaintiffs, are placed at very short and equal distances from the Ira. The body of the sacrificed chicken, because of the confined space, must now touch one of the calabashes, and the person re- presented by the touched calabash is considered the guilty party. The repository for the soul of an ancestor. The Bijago believe that the soul of an ancestor has a life which exceeds in duration that of the body. The soul is apparently not considered immortal, but may live as long as the person to whom it belonged is remem- bered by surviving family members. Upon the death of someone, a statue is carved to serve as the recep- tacle for the soul of the deceased. Because the dis- embodied soul has the power to inflict various sorts of punishment on surviving family members for past wrongdoings, frequent sacrifices are made to the statue (now infused with the soul of the deceased) to appease these potential angers. Of over two hundred Bijago traditional statues examined, and in all photographs observed of tradi- tional Bijago statuary, the majority are examples of one of four easily identifiable styles. The first consists of figures seated on a stool. The stool resembles the Ashanti style, and is considered a sacred object. It is reputedly used by members of the Grandeza during council meetings. Thus, it is possible that as an integral part of the statue, the stool represents individuals of rank. These figures seem to be of either sex and in varying degrees of abstraction (Figs. 2-5). All limbs are usually articulated. The second style consists of what appears to be a bust mounted on an hourglass-shaped base. The neck is cylindrical and disproportionately long. The head is abstract, with little emphasis on the cheekbones. A jutting effect is achieved by extending the frontal facial surface in almost a straight line from the eyes to the front of the chin (Figs. 6, 7, 10). The slightly ar- ticulated nose follows the same plane. The torso is boldly rectangular, usually only slightly wider at the top than at the bottom, and is frequently decorated with geometric designs. Arms, legs, and genitals are rarely indicated. Another distinct style is almost completely lacking in human characteristics. It has a predominantly cylindrical appearance, which is achieved by wrap- ping a wooden carving with a textile substance and plastering it with a liquid in such a way that the statue appears to be sealed within the wrapping. The final shape resembles a bowling pin. Only a jutting chin and, frequently, eyes are defined (Fig. 8). Limbs are never indicated, and sex is not identified. The last style is represented by a detailed head mounted on a cylindrical base. A sort of top hat is mounted on the head (Fig. 1). Figure 9 is an indication that not all Bijago func- tional statuary lends itself to easy morphological categorization. The figure, although partially des- troyed, was probably a standing figure with all its limbs at least partially articulated. Additional statues of this description have been observed, representing both males and females. Most of them are made from ironwood (Sapotaceae dulcificum). Simian and bird- like features are evident in many of the facial charac- teristics. Nails have frequently been driven into the head to serve as eyes (Figs. 1, 2, 4, 7). Some of the figures are reddened by the addition of a clay-like sub- stance to the wood. Many wear a sort of top hat (Figs. 1, 6, 4, 9). Bernatzik suggests that the top hat was bor- rowed from Europeans and worn, as a sign of rank, by kings or chiefs. Its addition to a statue may well lend status or power to the particular figure itself, or it may serve to identify the statue as one linked to a personage of high rank. It may also, in other cases, represent part of a naval uniform seen worn by European sailors. The use of chickens, eggs, palm wine, and other offerings as sacrificial material in conjunction with these statues has been documented.10 Many of these statues have traces of eggshells and feathers on them (Figs. 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9). It is not definitely known whether stylistic differ- ences can be attributed to time, function, sub-tribal or "Generational" identity, royalty versus non-royalty status, geography, artistic creativity, or some other factor. Bernatzik feels that time played a role in 56</page><page sequence="6">stylistic variation when he suggests that Bijago tradi- tional statuary became increasingly less abstract in time, progressing from the conical style to the detailed, seated figure.11 It is equally possible, however, that currently observed stylistic differences are the result of other factors. The relationship between style and function in Bijago statuary is not entirely clear; however, some agreement as to function seems evident with regard to at least two styles. In 1930-1931, Bernatzik referred to the statues he saw as either "fetiches" or as "figures representing the souls of deceased persons". The "fetiches" he also defined in the Bijago dialect of certain islands: Rande-Bubaque, Erandi-Caraxa, and Ramdi-Orango Grande. In 1946, Santos Lima referred to the statues as Iras and as Orrebuco images. He did not make a functional distinction between the two, although in one passage he described an Ira as a repository for the soul of an ancestor, and Orrebuco- Ocoto as the Supreme Being. Portuguese ethnographers now assign the following nomenclature to traditional Bijago statuary: (1) Eraminde': A divinity symbolizing indeterminate spirits which are tied to divinatory practices and fetichistic medicine. These sculptures preside prin- cipally at ceremonies destined to understand the cause of misfortune12; (2) Eraminho: Figures which incarnate the spirits of deceased family members.13 Bernatzik's references to Erandi, Rande, and Ramdi (fetiches) were to the statues now called Eraminde'.4 His figures "representing the souls of deceased ones" were Eraminh6s. Santos Lima's Orrebuco images are probably Eramindes, and his Iras the Eraminhos. In terms of the relationship between form and function, it seems clear that the conical style described above (Fig. 8), is that of the Eraminh6.15'16 It is probable, also, that the style resembling a bust mounted on an hourglass-shaped base is also that of the Eraminho.17,18 But what of the seated figures, the naturalistic head mounted on a cylindrical base (Fig. 1), or the standing figures? The figures representing a naturalistic head mounted on a cylindrical base is referred to by one professor as an Unika.19 Quintino indicates that no precise data are available on the function of this piece, nor the Unika divinity itself.20 Bernatzik describes the seated figures as being "repositories for the souls of deceased ancestors", but of a later date than the more abstract Eraminhos.21 He also shows a photo- graph of several statues representing both the seated style and the "bust mounted on an hourglass base" style, resting together in a villager's hut. He refers to all the statues in the photograph as receptacles for the souls of deceased ancestors.22 However, in at least one other photograph, a figure referred to as a "fetiche" (Eraminde) is a seated anthropomorphic figure.23 To date, there are no observations to suggest that by virtue of its form, the seated figure is necessarily an Eraminde or an Eraminho or something else. Thus, questions of form, meaning, function, and most of all the context within which traditional Bijago statuary came to be, are still, for the most part, without answers. Perhaps other investigators will one day tell us more. [ Notes, page 88 Of Silence, Of Noise Continuedfrom page 15 time undress herself. But what would I do in that case? I asked myself. I hate shouting, I thought. I hate silence as well. My wife always shouts or is silent, as if per- manently. I think I don't dislike my wife, a part of her demeanour at least, and I think I like the incommuni- cable quietness of a cold night in summer. But my wife's shouting hysteria about my, only my, inability to create with the right amount of water-matter, with the right proportion of wasted-yeast, and the night's silence's allure to woo the hairy wound of my wife's: that I couldn't look forward to with any feeling other than horror. Now I was halfway into the toilet. It was suffocating what with the small space provided for the bowel's braying, the heat, the noise that had preceded the sickening silence. I knew that something had gone awry inside of me. And I thought about child-delivery; about the drooling cry of a mother in labour, which is tempered with a pin-drop silence of all senses during and after pull-out of manufacture, and the manufac- ture's commencing to cry into the world immediately thereafter. The beauty, the lack of this exchange of moods of mother, manufacture and manufacturer and the latter's anxiety walking up and down the corridors of a dirty go-down.
