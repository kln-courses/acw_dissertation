<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ecology of Tropical Farming Systems By James M. Blaut Department of Geography, Yale University - Connecticut, U.S.A. 1. INTRODUCTION A topic as broad as the one to wich this paper is addressed can be handled in any of several ways. One might, for example, review the work that has been done on such questions as the "potential" of the tropics for settlement and agriculture, the general problem of soil erosion and conser- vation in the tropics, etc. Most questions of this sort have been explored as fully as our present knowledge permits by such scholars as Pelzer (1951, 1957a), Gourou (1953), Pendleton (1950, 1956), and others, and I see no point in dealing with them again here. There is, however, one topic which, I think, badly needs attention. This is the theoretical question concerned with defining the role of the environment in resource use, with placing the ecological phase of cultural ecology in some- what sharper focus. I submit that most of our thinking to date on the relation of man to environment in the tropics has suffered from three difficulties which seriously hinder our efforts to obtain the raw materials necessary for cross-cultural gene- ralization. One of these is a set of hampering assumptions, some discredited, others highly questionable and therefore best ignored, concerning supposed environmental "controls" and "influences" at work in the tropics. The second is a habit of thought which frames questions of man-environment relations in terms of environmental "possibilities" and '"restrictions", a negative for- mulation which is in several respects dangerous, but in any case excludes from analysis a wide range of fruitful questions since it merely defines ideal boundary conditions while ignoring the actualities of resource use, which operate within these limits - if, indeed, the limits can really be discovered in any given instance. The third difficulty stems from sloppy reasoning: too frequently we select one environmental condition which co-varies with a cul- tural feature, and treat it as the cause of that feature, forgetting that a necessary precondition need not be a sufficient cause, and that, in any case, the environmental condition can operate only in a cultural context which permits it-to have aa effect on the culture - a point to which we shall return shortly. The way around these difficulties, I suggest, is to seek a sharper defini- tion of the role of the environment in resource-using situations, which are considered here to include all instances of man-environment relations, except- ing only certain direct physiological transactions in which motivation plays no part. To accomplish this purpose it appears desirable to begin by formulating</page><page sequence="2">48 Revista Geográfica a general conceptual scheme which will encompass the tirée distinguishable elements directly involved in resource use: motivation and its determinants; behavior; and resources, or environmental materials. The approach has been tested in two studies carried out by the writer on peasant farming in Singapore (1951-53) and Jamaica (1957). It appears to hold promise of providing an analytic tool for detailed explanatory studies of tropical land use, those which discover, without benefit of environmenta- listic assumptions, the significance of the environment fer a given culture at a given time. It provides, as well, a viewpoint which can be used later in this paper for re-examining critically a numbc of current problems concerning tropical resource use in general, and plantation ecology in particular. Among these are such questions as the following: To what extent can soil erosion be blamed for the decline of many tropical plantation systems, among them the coffee plantations of Jamaica and the pepper gardens of Malaya? Are ee'tnin tropical (and extra-tropical) areas ''naturally" suited to plantation systems, or to small-holder or hacienda or other systems, or to agriculture whatever? Are we correct in assuming that tropical soils are "inherently" inferior to temperate soils? Are there specific crop-ecological conditions for the growth of crops normally associated with plantation systems which can be used to explain the distribution of these systems? The conceptual scheme to be outlined will be employed in venturing some preliminary answers to these questions. The answers can only be preliminary because the data at present available on the ecology of tropical knd use are far from adequate. 2. PROCESS ELEMENTS IN RESOURCE UTILIZATION Four groups of concepts appear to provide a framework for the under- standing of resource-using situations. One of these sets up a typology of processes relevant to such situations. A second defines the spatiotemporal limits within which these processes operate, the unit, as it were, of resource use. A third distinguishes conceptually between synchronie and diachrcnic phases, associating each with distinct data and methods . And a fourth suggests the stt of procedural stages in the analysis of resource-using situations which, in this trial formaulation, seem methodologically most useful. Clearly, the first group of concepts is the crucial one, and we shall begin by examining the classes of process involved in any resource-using situation. Several different typologies would serve here, since any attempt to isolate indi- vidual processes or classes of process from a functional continuum must be somewhat arbitrary. The one to be offered, however, has several advantages: it conforms in general to the conventional division of subject matter between cultural geography and cultural anthropology; it has survived two field tests in two culturally distinct tropical areas; and it does not require us to segregate the "natural" environment from the "man-made" environment or material culture. Geographic methods, and the cultural-geographic viewpoint, have been directed for the most part to the "resource" term in resource utilization. The concept of a resource is somewhat ambiguous; for our purposes the widest</page><page sequence="3">Instituto Pan- Amer i can o de Geografia e História 49 possible definition serves best. Whatever environmental materials are either actually or potentially involved in the set of processes in which human behavior exerts an effect on the material environment may be termed resources. Materials which are "actually" involved are those which do, in fact, undergo change as a result of human action, whether the end-product is an item of material culture or the slightly altered composition of a forest after selective cutting. Materials which are "potentially" involved are those which a group recognizes as being relevant to its interests, and therefore potentially subject to use. The important point here is that an environmental item is not a resource until it is recognized as being such; unless it is both perceived and assigned meaning and relevance, it can be excluded from consideration in a study of resource use, and it plays little or no part in cultural ecology. We can look at resource materials in various ways, depending on the purpose we have in mind. It is sometimes useful to range these materials along a continuum of change, from the relatively unaltered environment through suche intermediate stages as the harvest :d crop, the micro- environment of an arable field, or the artificial channel or body of water, to the highly altered resources forming material culture. Plantations, as Waibel (1952) and others have pointed out, extend the resource-using process into this final stage, by processing or at least preserving the crops, while peasant forms normally alter materials only to an intermediate stage, rarely extended beyond the point of preserving the crops. I will make use of this distinction later in the paper. It is also useful in certain instances to distinguish between those mate- rials having an instrumental function and those having a goal-satisfying one. Obviously, a breakdown of this sort is not based on any inherent property of the materials themselves, but depends on a particular cultural context. For example, tools would normally be considered instrumental, but their possession alone may have a goal-satisfying function. Similarly, in a commercial setting the harvested crop may simply be an instrument for acquiring wealth in the form of money. One of the important differences between plantations and smallholdings Iks in the degree of emphasis on instrumental materials, includ- ing tools, structures, fugitive materials (e.g., fertilizers), etc. Plantations nor- mally, but not always, make greater use cf these items. For comparative analysis of plantation and peasant farming systems I would suggest, therefore, the following generalized classification of resource materials: Ï. Slightly altered materials T. Instrumental (e.g., trees in a swidden rotation) B. Goal-satisfying (e.g., gathered vegetable products) II. Moderately altered materials A. Instrumental (e.g., a vegetable bed, irrigation water) B. Goal-satisfying (e.g., crops) III. Strongly altered, or processed, materials A. Instrumental (e.g., tools) A . Goal-satisfying (e.g., refined sugar) .</page><page sequence="4">50 Revista Geográfica The second class of processes is that of behavior, or, more precisely, muscular behavior involved in altering resources. By differentiating behavior as such from the motivations which underlie it we can avoid the thorny diffi- culties associated with attempts to assign "function" or "purpose" to any given act. Resource-using behavior is to be seen merely as an observable set of processes, having observable consequences, among wich those resulting in changes in materials are considered relevant. Motivation, or - borrowing a term from Parson - processes of "orient- ation" wich lead to resource-using decisions, form the third classe of processes in resource use. Orientation toward resource use seems to be made up of three partly distinguishable elements. The first, and for our purposes most critical, element is perception. This is by no means the simple sensing of an external object, but rather a complex process in which the sensation is both recognized and assigned meaning in relation to the goals of the resource-user. It is a commonplace, for example, that the swidden farmer, in viewing a piece of land for possible use, will not weigh the possibilities of building terraces on it; he will consider, rather, the stage of forest growth on it, the dryness of the vegetation, and so forth. For him it is those attributes of the land which relate to burning and slopeland cultivation, rather than terracing and flooding, which are perceived. Given a set of perceptions adding up to an awareness of a set of usable materials in the resource-user's surroundings, two further orientational elements enter in. One of these is value, the other skill. Clearly, we cannot speak of a particular set of perceptions, values, or even skills which are specifically associated with resource use alone; all there are bound in with the total-cultural context, and have both economic (i.e. resource-using) and non-economic elements. However, it is conceptually useful to distinguish an economic from a non-economic phase, and we are violating no ethnological tradition in doing so. In the case of perceptions, it seems safe enough to consider all apperceptions of materials, in which meanings are attached to them, as being involved in resource use. Insofar as we can isolate any one "value", the measure of its relevance is its influence on a decision leading to action vis-a-vis resources. Skills, again, can be defined as relevant if they concern the manipulation of materials, regardless of the goals such manipulation serves. The total array or complex of perceptions, values, and skills associated with an individual or group at any one time can thus be classified on a rule of thumb basis into relevant and irrelevant aspects, and the relevant aspects can be further divided into reinforcing and competing elements . The foregoing presents a highly simplified model of resource-using proces- ses. It will have to be modified to include such factors as time-depth, the distinction between relevant and irrelevant features in the perceived environment, in values, and in behavior, and the complications involved in a complex resour- ce-using decision where, for example, a plantation manager's actions are addressed not to the resources themselves but rather to the plantation labor force. First, however, it might be useful to provide an illustrative example of a single, resource-using act.</page><page sequence="5">instituto Pan-Americano de Geografia e Historia 5Í This illustration deals with a Chinese market-gardener in Singapore, whose behavior vis-a-vis resources is direct, involving only himself as participant, the tools he possesses, and the orientational processes at work in himself. It is noon on a rainless day, and the farmer is watering his beds of vegetables. The apperceptual element in this picture is assumed to be an awareness on the part of the farmer that the soil in the vegetable beds has dried out to the point where there is some danger of wilting if water is not applied. Value elements include, first, a reinforcing economic value, the desire to maxi- mize production by preventing wilting, since the narrow profit margin on each pound of vegetables sold results in a direct equation of yield with family level of living; second, a reinforcing non-economic value, the acceptance by the farmer of the fact that the job of applying water is properly his rather than his wife's or daughter's. Technical skills relate to the use of the Chinese double- bucket watering apparatus. The resultant of these and other orientational pro- cesses is a decision to undertake this act instead of some alternative, or compet- ing, act, either resource-using (e.g., tilling) or non-economic (e.g., taking the noontime siesta) . This act has the objective effects of increasing the moisture content of the soil and therefore lowering water tensions around the vegatable rootlets, of wetting and cooling the soil surface, thereby raising the relative humidity in the surface layer microclimate and reducing soil-surface evaporation, and of wetting and cooling the plant leaves, thus reducing water-loss through trans- piration . The farmer's perception of the effect of watering, however, based as it is on experience rather than science, differs somewhat from the picture pre- sented above. The plant leaves are known to be cooled by wetting, but is is the cooling itself which is believed to prevent wilting, rather than diminished transpiration. Water penetrating the soil is known to provide moisture for the roots, but the additional effect of decreasing evaporation at the surface is not recognized . What we have, then, is a highly simplified picture of an on-going set of process transactions, leading from orientation to bekavior, from behavior to material resources. The changes which take place in material resources at the end of this chain, insofar as they enter into a new perceptual field, result in a new set of orientations and further behavior - stopping the watering activity, taking up tilling, resting, etc. But the objective changes themselves lead into the beginning of the next chain only indirectly: it is the perceived, not the actual, changes which effect subsequent resource-using decisions. 3. THE FIELD OF RESOURCE-PROCESSES An illustrative model dealing with one unit productive act is, of course, far from realistic. It is necessary to introduce an additional concept, that of the "field" of resource-using processes, in order to concretize the model. Such a field can be defined as the spatiotemporal zone within which a set of resource-using processes operates. Within a given space-time region only those processes actually involved in resource use are considered to be internal</page><page sequence="6">52 Revista Geográfica elements in the field. External elements include not only forces impinging from outside, but also peripheral processes of orientation and behavior within the space occupied by the field . On a peasant farm such external processes having their locus on the farm itself would include competing values, alterna- tive non-economic (or at least non-farming) behavior, consumptive use of materials, etc. Those having their locus outside the farm might include prices, weather conditions, non-farm employment by family members, etc. In defining the boundaries of the field it is apparent that space, time, and relevance must all be taken into account. The utility of the field concept lies in the fact that it permits us to compare resource-using enterprises prossessing different qualitative and quan- titative characteristics. It has the incidental advantage, along these lines, of providing a means of placing the family-sized peasant farm and the large-scale plantation in the same resource-use perspective. Both fall into the category of unitary itesource-using fields, so long as the plantation retains the characteristic of unitary management, which, in the terminology employed here, translates into a relatively unified set of orientational processes governing productive be- havior and resource changes. By contrast, a share-cropped estate, such as the disintegrated cotton plantations of the Lesser Antilles, or a hacienda on which individual holdings dominate production, would have to be considered a set of separate resource-using units or fields. So long as a farm is managed (z= oriented) as a unit, be it a fragmented peasant farm, a set of swiddens operated by a family or community, a collective farm, or a corporate plantation, it retains the character of a sigle resource-using field. 4. SYNCHRONIC AND DIACHRONIC RESOURCE-USING FIELDS The foregoing discussion has assumed a relatively brief time-span in re- source-using processes. In field research, this is the kind of situation we shall of course encounter. Since the viewpoint is processual rather than structural, analysis of a resource-using field in these te'ms can lead to explan- ation, but only of a limited sort. For example, we can trace the effect on a field of a process transaction involving a given externally impinging process. We can explain resource changes in terms of the actions which bring them about. We can in certain instances explain a particular decision leading to behavior and material changes, or perhaps even a classe of such decisions, repeated periodically by one individual or simultaneously by a number (as by the field labor on a plantation) . In general, we can explain short-term cyclic changes in the field and short-term trends in its evolution. However: when we concern ourselves with origins, and in particular with the externally-impinging process elements which alter the course of evolution of a farming system seen as one class of resource-using fields, the viewpoint must be altered. While it is possible, for example, substantially to ignote for certain purposes the objective environment in synchronie analysis of a field, because during a period of one generation or less the modes of resource-apper- ception, and the environment itself, tend to remain fairly stable, a longer- term period must take the objective environment into careful account. Given</page><page sequence="7">Instituto Pan- Americano de Geografia e História 53 a set of unchanging economic values in the possession of a group; given, also, the universal fact that skill never approaches perfection in making use of an environment for satisfying these values, it can be predicted with a variable degree of confidence that two changes will occur in the resource-using field characteristically identified with the group, given enough time: first, the envi- ronment as apperceived may change in the direction approaching the objective environment, i.e., accumulating empirical knowledge of the consequences of resource-using behavior will often reveal errors in perception; and second, skills will often improve, in the sense that the s:me results will be achievable with less increment of effort. One might be led from this to the conclusion that a loophole has been provided here for the return of environmentalism, since supposed "adjustments" of culture to the environment are usually allowed a considerable period of time to become fixed in place. That this conclusion is invalid will be demonstrated shortly. 5. A TRIAL METHODOLOGY FOR THE ANALYSIS OF PEASANT FARMING ECOLOGY It seems desirable at this point to outline briefly a tentative methodology for studies making use of the foregoing system of concepts. What I shall do is present the stages in the analysis of resource-using data which I found useful in studies of peasant farming in Singapore. The first stage of analysis involved the identification and definition of functional fields. In Singapore, two such fields wee described, one a specialized vegetable-producing system, the other a complex mixed farming system in which material input consisted largely of stock feed, while output consisted largely (in terms of income) of vegetables. The second stage involved the enumeration of individual process elements making up and impinging on the field in the short run. These fell into the three groupe discussed previously - processes of orientation, behavior, and material change. Orientation processes were divided into convenient groups of unit-tasks (e.g., watering, tillage, planting and transplanting, etc.), and materials into the following sub-classes: crops, livestock, tools and equipment, productive structures, fugitive material input factors (e.g., fertilizers), soil mineral fraction, soil nutrients, soil water, soil air, and surface from micro- climate . In the third stage each process element was abstracted from the field as a whole and analyzed separately, to determine its qualitative characteristics, intensity, and relationship to other elements. This led to the definition of an ideal, or typical, case for each such element. The fourth, and final, stage involved synthesizing (or re-synthesizing) the separate elements into a functional model for each field. This model is constructed by fitting together the abstracted process elements into a simpli- fied, idealized picture of each field, one which can boused for prediction purposes by altering in kind or intensity any one or more of the component processes and examining the resulting changes for the field as a whole. (Cf. Blaut 1957) . For the specialized vegetable farming region the model turned up several critical points in the system, aspects of its functioning on which</page><page sequence="8">54 Revista Geográfica many others depended. One such key process transaction was hand- water ing; another intensive fertilization (over 50 tons per acre) . Diachronie analysis (only partly successful, because of the scarcity of data) involved the following stages: first, the critical process elements in the contem- porary field were traced back to the possible source areas (Kwangtung, Fukien, Malacca, and elsewhere) in an effort to locate a partly arbitrary "birth date" and place for each field; and second, an attempt was made to account for changes which took place in the fields in relation to specific impinging pro- cesses operative at various dates and places since then. The specialized vege- table-farming field proved to be of Chinese origin, and to have changed little in migrating to Singapore. The mixed farming field, however, though it had its essential origin in China, had gone through a major transformation, from small-holder food-crop cultivation in Fukien, through Chinese plantation-scale pepper and gambir planting in Malaysia, and back to peasant farming in the past century. The foregoing rather detailed description of a case study in methodology is presented for two reasons. First, since it has shown itself, at least in pre- liminary stages, to be applicable to the Jamaica data gathered during the summer of 1957, conceivably it has general applicability to peasant farming in the tropics, or a least some equivalent system which attacks resource-use in an explanatory manner without recourse to environmentalism will have such appli- cability. And second, it provides a jumping-off point for a suggested ampli- fication both of the theory and method to permit application to plantation systems as well. 6. APPLICATION OF THE CONCEPTS TO PLANTATION SYSTEMS The discussion so far has concentrated on a single mode of resource use, the tropical peasant farm. In spite of the profound differences between peasant and plantation farming systems, both can be considered within the same conceptual frame of reference, at least in terms of their ecological features. A brief comparison of the two in these terms should prove useful. Plantations, on the whole, deal with a more highly altered set of resource materials than do peasant farms or other varieties of tropical smallholdings. This applies to both the product itself and the instrumental materials surround- ing its production. As indicated above, plantations undertake semi-manufactur- ing functions much more frequently than do peasant farms, so that the final product is considerably more altered. If we extend the focus to include marketing, it is clear that plantation-derived products move farther as well: production of foodcrops for intra- region al or local sale is common on peasant farms, while plantation typically produce non-staples for foreign markets. Instrumental materials are, on the whole, more heavily emphasized and more strongly altered in the case of plantations. Three points can be made in this regard: First, tools, equipment, and structures are more elaborate, complex, and costly on plantations; second, they tend, on the average, to form a higher proportion of real costs, since plantations commonly seek to substitute me-</page><page sequence="9">Instituto Pan-Americano de Geografia e História 55 chanical equipment for labor where feasible; and third, the over-all crop-ecological environment is less "natural" in most cases on a plantation. The third point deserves some elaboration. While it is true that scientific principles in plantation management call for an attempt to reproduce natural ecological conditions as much as possible - e-g-, the rainforest environment for cacao, rubber, etc. - this can only be accomplished within narrow limits. The rainforest environment, for example, is one of mixed species, forming several storeys of growth. Economic considerations favor monocultivation on plantations, resulting in uniform stands, with one or at the most two (in the case of shaded crops like cacao and coffee) storeys. The peasant farm, on the other hand, grows its tree crops in mixed stands in most places. On a single half- acre plot in Jamaica, for example, one may find coffee, cacao, breadfruit, coconut, mango, and many other varieties of tree crops, with various legumes, yams, spice plants, taros, bananas, and other bush and ground crops beneath. The so-called "mixed garden" of fruit trees and vegetable in and around the Javanese village (Terra 1951), a pattern repeated in many other areas, is similarly diversified. Cultivation of ground crops on plantations - cane, cotton, sisal, etc. - contrasts in the same way with groundcrop cultivation on peasant farms, and even more conspicouosly with the highly complex intercropping found on non-commercialized smallholdings, especially on swidden fields. Plantations achieve considerably greater control over soil conditions than do peasant farms, and this, again, implies greater alteration of resource mate- rials. The Woodford Lodge and Louisiana field systems for cane, the Guianese polders with their interdigitating drainage and irrigation canals, the drainage systems on Malayan rubber plantations, etc., all involve the creation of a highly artificial micro-environment for the crops. Peasant farms, by contrast can not afford this measure of control in most areas, some exceptions being Asian wet-rice cultivation, and the intensive production of food crops in Mar- tinique (Gourou 1953), Singapore (Blaut 1953), and elsewhere. Differences in the character of labor or productive behavior between plan- tations and peasant farms are well known, and need not be outlined here. One point is worth emphasizing, however. While the variety of tasks involved in the production of a commercial crop is greater on plantations than on peasant farms, division of labor on the former is so advanced that each "job" involves a much narrower range of skills and activities. Thus participants in plantation production, with the exception of managers and techinicians (whos-e behavior is for the most part only indirectly addressed to resources), are highly specia- lized in their productive roles, in contrast to peasant farmers, who are res- ponsible for, and must be familiar with, all the activities involved in resource change . It is in the processes of orientation that differences between the two systems become extreme. While the peasant farmer makes his own decisions as to resource-using behavior, thus uniting the orientational and behavioral roles in one person (or at most one family), the decision-making process on plant- ations is largely divorced from implementing behavior. This, of course, includes the various processes leading up resource-using decisions. Resource perception is a function of various grades of technical and managerial personnel, who</page><page sequence="10">56 Rep ¿s ia Geográfica possess, as well, the more advanced skills. Governing values are generally imposed from outside, those of the managers and technicians being concerned with profits, which they see as directly related to their wages, but those of the labor force focussing on wages, often with little perception of the relationship between wages and profits at any one time. Highly involved modes of social interaction among participants in production, particularly those pertaining to the manipulation of labor, characterize the plantation, and individuals in managerial roles are dealing with resources only indirectly, through a screen of perceptions, skills, and values relating to men rather than materials. It is a well-known fact that non-economic values play an important role in peasant farm orienta- tions, but the social system of the plantation, which from one point of view can be thought of as the middle term between productive decisions and pro- ductive behavior, also intrudes an important non- economic element in this farming system. Thus the peasant farmer unites in himself all the functions associated with the role of resource-user, while on the plantation these functions are divided up among a multitude of separate roles, the result being a proliferation of non-resource-using tasks and motivations which intervene between the goals of production and the actual manipulation of resources. Herein, perhaps, lies the most important qualitative difference between the two agrosocial forms as viewed from the standpoint of resource use. 7. THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR IN RESOURCE USE Throughout this paper I have stressed the importance of distinguishing between the objective physical environment, on the one hand, and the sub- jectively apperceived physical environment, what Kirk (1951) calls the "be- havioral environment" and Sprout (1956) the "psychological environment", on the other. I have emphasized the subjective environment, since cultural pro- cesses in resource use include it as a central term, though they stop shcrt cf the objective environment, which, though highly relevant, is an externally impinging, non-cultural factor. It remains for us to consider briefly the signi- ficance of the objective environment, its manner and degree of relevance in cultural-ecological studies, and the reasons why one must study it in the course of analyzing a particular resource-using situation. Having certified its theoretical relevance we shall be able to take up some substantive examples dealing with tropical farming. The physical environment does not constitute a unique set of conditioning factors at a given time and place, one which differs in kind from social, poli- tical, religious, and other cultural factors. For the resource user it is merely one among these factors in his total, social and physical, environment. It assumes the character of such an apperceived factor only after being "filtered through the screen which culture interposes between man and nature" (Linton 1936:467). The meaning of the foregoing statement can be illustrated quite simply. Farmers in Mt. Frienship, Jamaica, evince the same attitude in the face of perceived but uncontrollable total- environmental forces whether these are such</page><page sequence="11">Instituto Pan- Am trican o Je Geografia e Historia 57 physical factors as rainfall and progressive decline in soil fertility on a plot of land, or such economic factors as prices and the probability that Kingston markets will absorb much or little produce on a given day. Singapore vegetable farmers similarly equate periodic regional flooding, with its resulting effect on yields, with price changes and other uncontrollable factors. In both areas the peasant farmer views external physical and cultural factors in roughly the same way. The foregoing discussion serves to place the objective environment in some- what clearer perspective. It is always segregated from culture by apperceptual processes. Therefore, one can never take a particular constellation of environ- mental factors and from it derive a particular resource-using pattern whithout considering, first, the manner and degree to which apperception of it would be warped by valuative and other processes, and, second, the total-cultural situa- tion in which the resource-using pattern would function and which it would affect. Leaping directly from objective environment to culture has been a common, perhaps the most common, error of the environmentalists. If the foregoing appears to devalue the significance of the objective phy- sical environment, let me say that this is neither my intention nor the impli- cation of the argument. The environment is important, often critically so, but its significance is always indirect. (Cf. Platt 1948a, 1948b.). Viewing a particular resource-using situation from the outside, as we do, we can see that certain objective changes take place in environmental materials during resource use. In a given resource-using system the kinds of environ- mental materials involved will be to a greater or lesser extent limited, and will differ to a greater or lesser extent from the materials used in some alternative system in the same or different environments. Within such a system, variations will be observed to correlate in part with variations in the materials utilized, and thus to a certain extent with varying site conditions - soil, slope, etc. Correlations of this sort between objective environmental conditions and re- source-using systems (which, in turn, correlate with other facets of culture, as Steward has show) mirror process transactions in roughly the following manner: Any observed case of an imperfect correlation (and these are never perfect) suggests that a part-cause is involved, that assembling of all such part-causes should theoretically provide a perfect or nearly perfect multiple correlation . The actual causal process here is the set of consequences of resource-using decisions, and such decisions are made on the basis of the many perceptual and other factors (or part-causes) listed previously. The strength of the correlation between variable factors within the resource-using system and environmental variables (e.g., soil) provides evidence of the degree to which the latter have been taken into account in resource-using decisions. This formulation, it will be noted, is totally devoid of any postulated environmental "influence" (an unfortunate, anthropomorphic expression), yet assigns the objective environ- ment a role in resource use. This role is neither more or less important than that of resource use, the subsistance factor, as a whole; the environment is simply one necessary element in any resource-using field. A study of the physical environment in relation to such a field can serve a number of concrete purposes, one of which, curiously enough, is the syste-</page><page sequence="12">58 Revista Geográfica matic undermining of environmentalistic theses. (One example of this, a body of data on soil characteristics which appears to contradict the assertion that soil erosin eliminated coffee planting in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica, will be discussed shortly . ) Another purpose served by physico-geographic analysis of contemporary resource-using fields is to establish the existence of correlations of the sort discussed above, and thus work toward an understanding of the degree to which the environment is taken into account in resource-using deci- sions. Still a third is to prove the existence or non-existence of relative envi- ronmental barriers - I stress the word relative - which, given a particular pattern of behavior, instrumental materials and resource-using goals, may limit pattern variation in one or another direction. A fourth, in which analysis of the objective environment provides data to be set against what can be learned of the subjectively- apperceived environment, leads to conclusions con- cerning possible improvements in efficiency in resource-using behavior by narrow- ing the spread between the two - here, of course, total-cultural analysis must be employed to determine both the viability and non-economic effects of chan- ges which improved efficiency would necessitate. Perhaps most important, there is the aim of deriving an objective schedule of real costs incurred by a given group in its resource-using activities. An explanatory word on this point seems in order. In very few resource-using situations are the relative environmental limits or barriers ever encountered. What we normally have is a set of cost curves, economic and social, which steepen toward the outer edges, where given be- havior vis-a-vis resources becomes prohibitively expensive - in labor input, cash expenses, social conflict, etc. It is probably true that every resource-using field which is in relative equilibrium - and I suspect this is not a common condition in undedeveloped areas today - has achieved a minimum resultant of such cost factors. In any case, one can offer the generalization that envi- ronmental limitation on resource use is almost always a matter of variable costs rather than dichotomized stop-and-go categories of "possible" and "impossible" behavior . Whenever we analyze resource use, whether in plantation systems, small- holder farming systems, or hunting and gathering, it is necessary to examine the field as a whole. This includes a study of the objective environment, of behavior, of values (especially, in peasant and plantation systems, price-values), of technical knowledge, and of the manner in which the resource user assembles a subjective picture of the environment. One of the reasons why we have so few explanatory generalizations about resource-using systems and their signi- ficance for culture - the various studies by Steward (1955), Mints (1956), Wolf (1956), and a few others are important exceptions - would seem to be the lack of attention on the part of geographers to the behavioral and orientational aspects of the fields, and of anthropologists to the material aspect. Past assertions about the "influence" of the environment, the "control" it exerts, man's "response" to it, etc. have been made on the basis of imperfect know- ledge of one or another of these terms in the resource-using equation . Environ- mentalistic geographers (of whom very few survive) have tended to argue</page><page sequence="13">Instituto Pan- Amer toan o de Geografia e Historia 59 from the well-analyzed environment to the poorly-analyzed culture, while the occasional environmentalistic anthropologist has argued from the poorly-analyzed environment to the well- analyzed culture. 8. SOME SUBSTANTIVE APPLICATIONS TO TROPICAL FARMING SYSTEMS I propose, in this section, to take up the questions referred to at the start of this paper, those concerned with the direct role of resource use and the apperceived environment, and the indirect role of the objective environ- ment, in certain tropical situations . These questions are merely illustrative of the wide range of problems which need study in terms of the present, or some other, non-environmentalistic system for conceptualizing resource-using fields, to obtain a firm basis for cross- cultural generalizations regarding cultural ecology and its implicates in tropical areas. (1) To what extent can soil erosion be blamed for the decline of many tropical farming systems, among them the coffee plantations of Jamaica? This question has to be approached from two standpoints: first, from a consideration of tropical erosion processes; and second, from a consideration of the causes and effects of erosion in relation to cultural modifiers. In recent years it has become clear that accelerated soil erosion in the tropics is much more rapid, yet much more short-lived in its effects on most soil types, than is the case in temperate lands. Serious erosion inevitably accom- panies swidden cultivation on steep slopes, yet such slopes usually come back into production in twenty years or less. The processes of soil erosion and regeneration are, in a word, considerably speeded up under tropical conditions of high temperature and high moisture. In the Blue Mountains of Jamaica erosion and recovery proceed with unusual rapidity on many soil types: one instance was noted in which subsoil expensed by a deep landslip was produc- ing bananas within two years of the occurence of the slip, and another instance was noted where clean-weeded bananas were growing on subsoil lying at a slope of 63°. Thus it is clear that we must begin by discarding temperate area notions of soil erosion. Erosion cannot be stopped on most slopelands in the tropics, short of terracing, but, in contrast to the eroded gully-lands of, say, Georgia, many if not most tropical soils need not go out of cultivation in consequence . Accelerated soil erosion, in contrast to normal geological erosion, is em- phatically a result of certain resource-using processes. Chief among these in the wet tropics is the simple process of exposing the bare soil to rain, producing rapid surface runoff which carries soil particles downslope. This process will occur under any farming system which exposes the soil even for a short time, and thus under any system employing ground crops or widely spaced, or thin- canopied, tree crops. The fact that such systems survive is sufficient evidence that an equilibrium can be maintained between erosion and generation, one which varies under differing resource-using and soil conditions, with varying yields the result. Accelerated erosion has been blamed for the decline and abandonment of coffee in Jamaica's Blue Mountains, in Brazil, and elsewhere, and of pepper</page><page sequence="14">60 R e v ¡sta G c o g r á fica plantations in southeast Asia, to mention a few examples. Can we, in the light of our knowledge of resource-using prccesses, venture an opinion on the vali- dity of such causal assertions? There is serious reason to doubt whether erosion can be singled out as the determinative factor in any one of these cases. The viability of swidden cultivation in areas of law population density (Cf. Gourou 1953) demonstrates that, given enough land, a long-term rotation could, at least in theory maintain production from a given plantation . Probably never does erosion proceed rapidly enough in a tree-crop plantation to prevent a certain measure of bearing from each tree before its soil is washed away. Therefore, the rate of replanting which a given system of cultivation and a given cost-return situation permit must be taken into account. In most cases it is a question either of the cost of replanting in relation to the rate of decline in production and the returns at a given time, or of a deliberate choice to move on the available new land within the region or elsewhere. Two illustrations may be cited in this connection. One is drawn from an obscure plantation system found in Southeast Asia, the second from Jamaica. Chinese in Singapore of the early 1800's developed a plantation system em- phasizing pepper and gambier, capital coming from Fukienese merchants in the town of Singapore, and labor from indentured Chinese immigrants. The cycle of production was about 14 years in lenght, the method of cultivation such as to induce rapid depletion and erosion. On none of the plantation enterprises was a given piece of land used through more than one cycle, the result being a wildfire spread across the island and complete withdrawal from it in 50 years. The explanation for this wholesale abandonment of land and subsequent emigration to Johore lay not in the inability of the land to be re-used (later Chinese cultivators took up the cultivation of cassava, pineapples, and vegetables on seme of it) but rather in the fact that new land could be cleared and planted at lower cost than would have been required for manuring and anti-erosion parctices (both techniques being well known to the planters). (Cf. Blaut 1957). The 19th century coffee plantations in the Blue Montains of Jamaica were wiped out by erosion, according to Tempany et al. (1942:31): "The decrease in [coffee] acreage is entirely attributable to the devastating effects of soil erosion .... The soils of this area are very erodible . " However, our soil analyses in the area indicate, as mentioned previously, that regeneration pro- ceeds at a rapid rate on many of the coffee soils. If subsoil can become pro- ductive at as rapid a rate as prevails on the "purple conglomerates" of this area, it seems unlikely that erosion can be blamed for the decline of the plantations, although it must have helped matters along by raising production costs. Another explanation, pobably the coincident drop in the price offered in British markets, must be substituted as the major causal factor. It is usually, then, a question of relative cost, rather than one of the permissive or prohibitive influence of soil erosion. We conclude that soil erosion will always affect the cost of production on plantations, but only on certain thin soils, and on certain other soils possessing a concretionary layer</page><page sequence="15">Instituto Pan- Americano de Geografia e Historia 61 which will harden irreversibly on exposure, can true environmental limits come into play. (2) Are there specific crop-ecological conditions for the growth of crops normally associated with plantation systems which can be used to explain the distribution of these systems? Each crop grown on plantations has its own crop-ecological requirements, and plantations would not last very long where these were totally flouted. (Witness the hasty abandonment of poorly drained alluvial soils by early Ma- layan rubber planters). But within the rather broad ecological limits for the growth of such crops, one finds plantations situated only on very few of the potential productive areas, probably never near the limits themselves. In some instances the availability of land or labor is the primary locational factor; in others it is an advantageous marketing route. (Cf. Peteer 1957b) . In still other cases it is largely the fact that an area has relatively favorable ecological conditions, i.e., conditions closer to the optimum than are those possessed by some available alternative, which proves decisive . As a general rule, one can probably say that optimum ecological conditions will be selected for plantation sites, or that plantations on such sites will fare better than ecologically less favored competitors in the short run, only when the cost differential based on this factor outweighs all others - labor, marketing cost, political stability, etc. However, in the long run it is usually the plantations possessing the most favorable sites from the standpoint of crop ecology which, in a given region, survive - a case in point being the aban- donment of uplands in favor of irrigable lowlands in West Indian plantation sugar. But to seek to explain the distribution of plantations simply by stating that "the best soils within a region are chosen - within the limits of acces- sibility to the shipping service" (Durand 1955:113) is quite incorrect. (3) A"e certain tropical (and extra-tropical) areas "naturally" suited to plantation systems, or to smallholder or hacienda or other farmkig systems, or to no agriculture whatever, given the characteristics of these systems as they are found today? I suspect that I am belaboring the obvious in dealing with most aspects of this question, but opinions here are by no means obvious, and some useful points can be brought out. The only areas I know of which, by virtue of their physical environments, are relatively limited to plantation agriculture among the competing systems are those whose clearing or maintenance involves too high a capital outlay for individual peasants. But when some form of group farming, or cooperative credit arrangement, or capital assistance by government (e.g., in opening up the Sungei Manik swamps of Malaya for wet rice cultivation) is brought into the picture the relative advantage enjoyed by plantations can be eliminated. Again it is a question of costs (in the general sense) rather than any dictate of the environment . It is true, however, that certain types of environments are quite inacces- sible to agriculture. But these include only rocky slopes, unirrigable deserts, tundra, etc. Although it has been pointed out (Tatham 1951:161) that under certain circumstances it may pay to form such areas, albeit at extremely high</page><page sequence="16">62 Revista Geográfica cost, the system would more closely resembly hydroponics than agriculture (as is the case with Russian experiments in Arctic vegetable production under glass). Some special problems emerge when we consider the environmental rela- tions of swidden, or shifting cultivation, the least intensive of the important agricultural systems, and inquire whether it would be less "natural" to have sedentary smallholdings in the same environment. It has been argued that, under typical wet-tropical slopdand conditions, no more intensive system is normally possible, in view of the rapid leaching of nutrients in these soils and immobilization of much of the nutrient supply in plant tissues, as well as the difficulty of controlling erosion. (We need not consider here the per- manent stands of tree crops such as rubber and cacao, which can, with proper management, be maintained over long periods of time because their almost complete ground cover slows erosion, and the nutrients drawn off each year in yields amount only to a small fraction of total nutrient supply. Plantations of this sort seem to be no more intensive a form of agriculture than swidden cultivation in any case . ) Most wet-tropical slopelands are occupied by groups practicing swidden cultivation. However, there are some important exceptions. (Cf. the excellent treatment of this topic in Gourou, 1956:336-49.) In some cases sedentary cultivation is found on unusually fertile or non- erosi ve soils. In others a high-value crop pays for food imports to make up the deficit in local pro- duction. But there are a number of other areas of sedentary cultivation where special circumstances cannot be called in to explain the pattern by pointing to an atypical environment or external food sources. In such areas population density is generally high, due either to a contraction of the land area occupied by a given group (as in parts of West and East Africa) or to population increase (as in the West Indies) - neither situation, it should be noted, deriving from improvement in subsistence techniques. In most cases there seems to be a progressive shortening of the forest fallow, ending in a situation where a grass fallow sometimes shorter than the crop period emerges, and we have true sedentary cultivation. In the West Indies this may not have been the typical pattern, but the end-product is similar. Hardy (1949), in Trinidad, has observed peasant farms where no fertility increment whatever is supplied the soil, and very low yields are obtained on a sustained basis from mineral nitrient-release alone. But elsewhere special devices have been employed to increase yields by adding organic matter (animal residue, crop residue, grass, etc.). Terracing, contour ditches, and other anti-erosion measures are also em- ployed in at least some of the areas. In short, peasant farmers in such loca- lities have achieved considerable intensification and a higher level of areal productivity . Systems of permanent slopeland cultivation are found on mediocre soils from Madura to the West Indies. Although they occupy a relatively small portion of the wet tropics as a whole, their existence alone clears up one point: the typically infertile and often steeply-sloping soils of tropical uplands - for exemple, most of equatorial South America - can support an agricultural system more intensive than swidden cultivation.</page><page sequence="17">Instituto Pan-Americano de Geografia e Historia 63 Gourou (1956) carries the argument well beyond this point. Shifting cultivation is considered by him to be "the expression of a civilizational level and not the result of any inescapable physical constraint" (339) . Its wide distribution reflects the fact that it is a resource-using system which can feed a limited population fairly adequately, and on a sustained basis, so long as ample land is available. Both Pelzer (1945, 1957a) and Gourou (1953, 1956) stress the viability of this resource- using system in the absence of over-population, which nlay have been only locally important before the period of European penetration. Both point to the fact that the seemingly primitive implements employed in swidden cultivation - notably the dibble, hoe, axe, and knife - are, in fact, the most efficient under the circumstances: ploughing, for example, can be highly erosive in its effect, whereas the common swidden pattern of leaving the soil untilled, and merely drilling seeds holes with the dibble, does not contribute to erosion. It appears to be true, also, that labor requirements are low for this farming system, by contrast to some and perhaps most of the more land-intensive systems . The foregoing provides us with a possible explanation for the fact that few swidden-farming groups in tropical slopeland areas adopted more intensive farming systems in the absence of outside pressure or its indirect effects, such as overpopulation. Spices (1952:292) argues that "people do not vary their customary behavior unless they feel some need which existing ways do not satisfy." It appears that swidden cultivation has, on the whole, adequately satisfied the subsistence needs of its practitioners, at least until recently. Under such circumstances, the fact that swidden groups in direct contact with others practicing more intensive agriculture (e.g., wet-rice cultivators in Asia) have generally failed to adopt the intensive methods in preference to their own, is readily understood, and the explanation does not require us to postulate any "inescapable physical constraint", inherent in the environment of wet-tropical slopelands . It is, indeed, less surprising to find that swidden cultivators have resisted change toward more intensive systems than to find that the opposite change does not commonly take place. That the latter sort of change does, on occasion, take place is well documented. Waibel (1955) cites the case of Europeans in Brazil adopting this system from local examples. In parts of the West Indies farmers work marginal land on a shifting basis: a farmer will rent a plot of land, farm it for a year or two, then abandon it for another plot, the original one lying fallow until a second man decides that it has recovered sufficiently to justify his renting it in turn. Furthermore, the recorded adoption of swidden practices is not limited to smallholdings. Pelzer (1957b) points out that tobacco plantations of Sumatra employ this form of land rotation. And the Chinese pepper and gambir plantations of 19th century Singapore represented an extreme instance of shifting cultivation - never, apparently, did they find it necessary to return to a plot a second time. And finally, we might refer to the African and Asian examples cited by Gourou (1956), in which groups which had once practiced shifting cultivation, and subsequently adopted more intensive methods because of outside pressure or population growth, on occasion</page><page sequence="18">64 Revista Geográfica reverted to the traditional pattern where the opportunity to do so presented itself . Thus it appears that, under certain circumstances, swidden cultivation is the low-cost resultant which we allow as the only important kind of "influence" exerted by the environment. In a word, it is commonly the most efficient system on wet-tropical slopelands, given certain cultural (including popula- tion) and environmental condition. But we cannot say that it is the "naturai" form in areas of this sort, nor can we agree that there is a specific "agri- cultural potentiality" (Meggers 1954:815) of certain environments allowing no more intensive system than shifting cultivation. In fact, soils which are among the very worst in the tropics, among them infertile sandy loams of Singapore and the alluvial taillings left over after tin-dredging operations in Malaya, are being used by Chinese farmers to obtain high yields on an intensive, permanent basis. While it appears to be true that the cultural patterns associated with swidden cultivation can, in part, be explained in terms of it, it does not follow that these pattern can ben be explained in terms of environmental potential, or this in combination with realized level of sociocultural integration up to a presumable environmentally-determined limit. Swidden cultivation is invariably associated with relatively low population density, and certain cultiral regula- rities (cf. Steward 1955) would presumably appear as a consequence wherever this system prevails. In addition, the uniformities cited by Meggers (op. cit.) for swidden groups in the Tropical Forest area of South America may very well have parallels elsewhere. But these derive from a cultural-ecological pattern, not from a special variety of environment. All we can say with regard to the environment is that one of the many possible agricultural systems it "permits" is swidden cultivation, and that this system is perhaps the simplest one in terms of technique. (4) Finally, we may consider very briefly the summary evaluation of tropical soils which dismisses them as inherently "inferior" to temperate soils. Soil, as we know, is a highly complex system, and, cultural relations apart, cannot be indexed on a single continuum of "superiority" to "inferioty" . The separate aspects of a soil must be dealt with individually. As regards fertility - outrient status - it seems clear enough that wet- tropical soils are at a definite disadvantage, since leaching and erosion remove nutrients more rapidly than is the case in temperate areas, and nutrient incre- ments such as humus, organic fertilizers, and inorganic fertilizers decay more rapidly as well. Tropical soils exhibit much lower average readings for N, P, and K than do temperate enes. In addition, tropical soils are more easily eroded, in part as a result of heavy rain (the total annual quantity and the intensity of showers) and in part because of the steeper average slopes derived from tropical weathering and mass-movement. On the other hand, tropical soils possess two qualities not shared in like degrees by their temperate counterparts . One of these is the rapid rate of nutrient release from the mineral fraction, and the correspondingly vigorous rate of soil regeneration after erosion . It is possible to have permanent culti- vation of tropical slopelands, albeit at a very low level of areal productivity, on the basis of these nutrients alone, whereas, in temperate lands, most soils</page><page sequence="19">instituto ? an- Americano de Geografia e História 65 yield their nutrients so slowly that loss of the tcpsoil, with its accumulation of humus, is usually tantamount to loss of the soil for many decades and perhaps centuries. Hardy (1949) and Pendleton (1956) have noted the curious anomaly that soil erosion is actually helpful in some few tropical soils, because it removes the upper layer from which nutrients have been leached and drawn off by crop plants. This "use" of erosion seems to assist in parts of the Blue Mountains of Jamaica, it may be remarked. A second "value" of tropical soils is the complex of factors - depth of weathering, stability of certain elements of structure, etc. - which lead to the fact that workable soils may be found on much steeper slopes than in temperate areas. Attempts to apply temperate area criteria for determining maximum utilizable slopes in the tropics are almost ludicrous in some cases: in certain parts of the tropics, notably the West Indies, permanent cultivation is found on "impossible" slopes, and this without terracing, while swidden fields man be even steeper. 9. CONCLUSIONS Three things have been attempted in this paper. First, I have tried to define the role of the environment in tropical farming systems, and have elaborated one possible conceptual zation of resource-using processes in order to permit us to view the environment's role without stumbling into the pitfalls of environmentalism . Second, I have provided several illustrations of environ- mental (but not environmentalist) factors in tropical farming systems, with a certain amount of emphasis on plantation systems. And third, I have stressed the desirability of viewing these systems from the geographic standpoint, which I consider to be that of resource use. There has also been a deliberate undercurrent, in the preceding discussion, of optimism regarding tropical re- source use, deliberate because I sense to much pessimism in the prevaling out-look. Since our fund of data on tropical farming is meagre at best, either position can be taken without fear of contradiction. Thirty years ago it was necessary to argue against those who spoke in glowing terms of tropical soils as evidenced by the luxuriance of an undisturbed rain forest. Today, I submit, we must face in the opposite direction and question the more pes- simistic views, those which stress environmental limitations. * BIBLIOGRAPHY Blaut, James H. 1953 "The Economic Geography of a One- Acre Farm in Singapore Island: a Study in Applied Microgeography," Malayan Journal of Tropical Geography, I. 1956 "A functional study of Chinese Vegetable Cultivation in Singapore," Anns.
