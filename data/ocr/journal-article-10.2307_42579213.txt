<plain_text><page sequence="1">FASCISM AS A SEMANTIC VOID INTO THE META-NARRATIVE OF RATIONAL MODERNITY Alessandro Saluppo The fascist main ideology purpose nor of an this investigation essay is neither on structure, an analysis practices, on the and origins cultural of fascist ideology nor an investigation on structure, practices, and cultural self-representations of the fascist state, but a study on the pathogenesis and etiology of fascist existential ethos, which must be intended as a "temporary epistemic and semantic void" into the meta-narrative of rational-modernity. I have defined this meta-narrative as a self-replicating generator of symbolic codes, norms, and values, which tend increasingly toward an integral techni- cization of life, by the enframing of bio-functions into a mathematical set of axioms. Furthermore, in this instrumental meta-narrative, I have pointed out the bio-political ability to continuously produce internal functions of immunization and repression of heterogeneous impulses,1 and also to reintro- duce life-contingency into rigid systems of knowledge and into transcendental forms of power. In this repressive action of immunization, suppression and normativization is possible to frame the transition from "fascist existential ethos" to fascist totalitarian praxis or better the conversion of an epistemic and semantic void - symptom of existential malaise and resistance against practice of denaturation - into a totalitarian mechanism of normativization and bio-repression that is characteristic of Fascism one-dimensional bio-power. Alessandro Saluppo is a ABD doctoral student in Modern European History at Fordham University, New York. He has carried out research on political violence in twentieth-century Europe, fascism and right-wing extremist movements. He has also worked on political philo- sophy, biopolitics, and critical theory. Currently, he is working on political violence in Italy in the aftermath of the Great War. 394</page><page sequence="2">Fascism as a Semantic Void into the Meta-Narrative of Rational Modernity 395 From the nineteenth century, instrumental knowledge, focusing on perso- nal identity, biological processes, time and space, and codes of daily life, has efficiently controlled and technically manipulated discursive practices in order to normativize and to "normalize" bio-functions within functional disciplinary frameworks, and to anesthetize or pre-emptively repress heterogeneous and incommensurable insurgencies, perceived as pathological anomalies. The synthesis between episteme and techne, the systemic application of the Leibnizian project of mathesis universalis as calculation, and the modern development of productive forces, determined not only the progressive techni- cization of knowledge - perceived here as a continuous dialectic between prometheia and epimetheia2 - but also a systemic arithmetization of life in the enframing of biological functions by computational, homogeneous, and productive systems of algebraic laws. The triumph of technical instrumentality and the increasing objectification of purposive rational action in technical systems3 have disclosed the instrumental and systemic attempt to dissolve biotic heterogeneities in techne and, in turn, to neutralize anomalies and irre- gularities by the creation of an auto-generative, de-territorialized microphysics of power over bodies. Indeed, the mechanological transition from passive to reflexive and active machines, the dissolution of the anthropomorphic body into rational and computational axioms, the theoretical harmonization of the body image with symmetrical and functional machinic models, and the conse- quent appearance of technical individuals in the form of machines define intrinsically the meta-narrative of rational-modernity. Therefore, the epistemic and metaphysical paradigm of modernity ensues as: the instrumental technici- zation of life, the construction of mechanical and geometrical models of the living body, the economic techno-utilization of the body-machine, the progres- sive rationalization of the institutional-bureaucratic framework, and the rise of a bio-political sovereignty by the institutionalization of the dichotomy between normality and pathology. The etiology of this aseptic bio-machinic paradigm has a binary pathogen- esis and it must be carefully researched in the context of seventeenth century mechanistic and physical thought. Galileian, Hobbesian, and Cartesian mechan- istic conception of nature and the transition from a feudal to a bourgeois world- view overshadowed the "qualitative philosophy" of antiquity and the Christian humanitas of the middle age, by converting the division of artisanal work into a uniform, repetitive, and structured act of production (Borkenau). Accordingly, the calculation of work in terms of purely quantitative mathematical models corresponded to the quantification of acts previously conceived as qualitative, and to a new conception of the body as a structured, homofunctional machine.</page><page sequence="3">396 ETC • October 2012 Leading from this re-conceptualization of productive practices, the human body started being interpreted as a system of fixed structures organized in invariant causal chains, where any bodily function was directly determined by an inner arrangement of parts. From Vesalius' De humāni corporis fabrica to the eight- eenth century's sophisticated analogical automata and the application of biome- chanics to the animal-economy, bodily functions were increasingly introduced into axiomatic, formal systems, marked by systematic physiological and biologi- cal taxonomies in which the organic dynamics of constituent parts were exclu- sively defined in terms of the machinic functions of the whole. This mechanical vision of the human body endowed with a causal-deterministic structure, in which living organisms could be shown to act in accordance with empirical and rational norms of calculability, consistency, identity, and predictability, repre- sented the epistemological and metaphysical discourse that supported seven- teenth and eighteenth century physiological studies on the circulation of blood, the lymphatic system of vessels, and the microscopic structure of tissues, respira- tory functions and sensory fibers. In the nineteenth century, philosopher and physicist applied to the human body the same practice of standardization and simplification used for techno-mechanistic modeling and design. Discourses on the system of mechanical representations on the body machine, labor power, and industrial productivism aimed to subjugate the human body to rational practices of standardization and uniformation of qualitative and "metric" char- acteristics in order to render the body a rigid, univocal, univalent, and inter- changeable object of production.4 In this industrial semantic of technicization, the most important pathogenic process of body "objectification" resides pre- cisely in the technical transfer of body functions into a rational and theoretical system of propositions, where the body is perceived as an integrated whole, cap- able of self-replicating with the functional rigidity of a machine and to mediate with de-anthropomorphized and quantitative-instrumental laws of production. This mechanical and technical "denaturation" of the human body was perennially confronted with Vitalistic theories, which protested that life could only be explained by laws intrinsic to living organisms, and essentially differ- ent from those applied to inorganic life. In opposition to the mechanistic idea that "order and existent are supposed to precede themselves or to precede the creative act that constitute them" by reflecting an image of beings according to their static and immanent "degree, dimension, position and proportion" (Deleuze), Vitalism emphasized intuition, creativity, heterogeneity, differentia- tion, duration as continuous multiplicity and the creative living flux of life on matter. In his treatise, Aspects of Vitalism, Georges Canguilhem describes how mechanism and vitalism reflected two radically different theories of life,</page><page sequence="4">Fascism as a Semantic Void into the Meta-Narrative of Rational Modernity 397 since "vitalism translated a permanent exigency of life within the living and mechanism translated a permanent attitude of the human towards life."5 Contaminated with an existentialist intuition of politics,6 this vital principle of distrust toward the technological form of the body-machine, analogic thinking, and the power of technics over life, combined with the Bergsonian emphasis on the flux of experience, intuition, élan vital, the notion of life as "becoming" over being, and the emphasis on the holistic character of organ- ism over liberal atomism, would come to characterize the existential ethos of the first Fascism. All vitalistic theories, from the pneumatic theory of Jean Baptiste Van Helmont to the entelechial and vitalistic hypothesis of Claude Bernard and Hans Driesch, rejected systematically the mathematic rationalism of the Enlightenment and the Cartesian mechanist model of nature. In the Cartesian metaphysics of rationality, the process of body objectification and the theory of animal-machine are inseparable from the Cogito ergo sum with its ontologi- cal separation of body and soul. From the refutation of Aristotelian hylo- morphism and the scholastic doctrine of anima forma corporis, Descartes subdivided reality into res cogitans and res extensa, opening up the subject and object/mind and body/thought and extension dichotomy. The imperious primacy of the Ego cogito, as the source of cognition and prime locus of thought and representation, and the reduction of the body as extension or cor- poral substance, alone endowed with geometrical properties, determined on the one hand a radical process of subjectivization, which subsequently brought the individual to objectify its own self in its relationship to a power of external control,7 and on the other hand the tendency to dissolve physis in the absolute Ego (modernity).8 In the Cartesian dualism, it emerges that the body repre- sents not only a mere physical object under the permanent horizon of Ego's cogitations and a geometrical extension for subjectivity, but also the intimate association of the absolute Ego with functions of domination, command, and organization. This relation essentially implies the domination of nature; not only as control, mediation, efficiency, rationality, predictability, but also as alienation, dehumanization, and abstract auto-assertion; the self as medium of rationality and technici ty 9 This curious oxymoron, represented by the dissolution of the "absolute" self into normative frameworks of rational- productivistic forms, generates the quintessentially modern dysfunction in the relationship between "bare life" (zoe) and a new sovereignty based on compu- tational and quantitative paradigms of knowledge. Therefore, in the seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries, theorization of the absolute dominion of the self, quantitative, and mathematical modes of thinking, and the related</page><page sequence="5">398 ETC • October 2012 desire to fix nature in objective and universal rational systems of thought, the body-machine equation finds its essential pathogenesis. Translated into socio- political terms the equation body = machine, and its normative power of mea- surement, corresponds to a systematic and static rationalization of the social bios; "an intensification and generalization of the normalizing apparatus of disciplināri ty" (Foucault)10 and a relentless process of disenchantment, de-energization, and erosion of the magical in nature. This Weberian disen- chantment and social de-energetization are extremely important political phe- nomena, given that the ever-increasing rationalization and bureaucratization of life generated these pathological morphogenetic processes that led in turn to the mystical re-sacralization of the natural body and its spatial and tem- poral dimensional extents.11 In the nineteenth century, in accordance with the establishment of the general principle of conservation of energy, which asserts that all the forces of nature (electricity, magnetism, heat, and mechani- cal work) are forms of a single universal energy, the human body was re- conceptualized as a thermodynamic machine, and its work as a metaphor of "physiochemical exchange." Social energetism, "human motor," muscular thermodynamics, Helmholtzianism, physiology of the labor, ergonomics, psy- cho technics, and Taylorization configured the body as a system of economies of force and a focal point for new techniques of production. In "The Human Motor," Anson Rabinbach has correctly underlined that the translation of thermodynamics laws into a program of social modernity repositioned the body "in a field of forces capable of infinite transformation and conversion simultaneously linking the cosmos to the body and to the productive order of work. This body mediated between the laws of nature and the laws of produc- tion. It dissolved the anthropomorphic body as a distinct entity and made the industrial body subject to a sophisticated analytics of space and time."12 The dissolution of the anthropomorphic body, a new psychological language of space and time,13 and the rise of a single productivist metaphysics determined the formation of new discursive practices and the transition from the repres- sive hypothesis to bio-power (Foucault, Security , Territory, Population). The disciplinary practices of social modernity and productivism provoked psychia- tric and bio-morphological anomalies such as a mechanistic state of deperso- nalization and "discourses of self-negation"; the suppression and limitation of cenesthetic factors by impersonal systems of socialized discourses and collec- tive norms (Starobinski); pandemic mental fatigue and neurasthenic symptoms as products of the technical assimilation of the human organism to the machine; the mathematical and rational repression of "superfluous move- ments" and the creation of alienated conservative patterns of muscular</page><page sequence="6">Fascism as a Semantic Void into the Meta-Narrative of Rational Modernity 399 movements that caused epidemic locomotory disturbances, asthenic symp- toms, bodily mutilations and fatalities; the de-naturalization of the productive act as a libidinal investment and the consequential insurgence of sexual mala- dies (Reich); and finally, depressive symptoms, alienation, spatio-temporal disorientation, and suicide. Furthermore, while the first law of thermody- namics sustained that energy may be transformed from one form to another - assuming that the total amount of energy remains constant - the second law of thermodynamics established the irreversible decline of energy and the increase of entropy in any given (closed) system. The fin de siecle' s decadent culture tautologically associated the principle of energetic entropy with the notions of degeneration, disorder, and decadence. Morel, Lombroso, and Nordau's theories of retrograde evolution and deviation of the organism from its original type influenced massively the decadent European imagery of the fin de siecle, producing a palingenetic mythopoeia of decadence, and a parallel political scheme of the energetic regeneration of the sacral social body. In this "energetist" genealogy of the modern individual as a de-sacralized and dis- eased object of production, it is possible to identify the fascist existential ethos as a political model based on a decadent and pathogenic Weltanschaaung. The subsequent shock of World War I generated successively a "schizophrenic metaphysics of crisis," collective anxiety and a profound sense of decadence, and at the same time a neurotic surplus of energy (Doblin and Simmel's die Neigung zu exzessen ).14 In The elementary forms of religious life, Emile Durkheim sustained that "under the influence of some great collective shock in certain historical periods, social interactions become much more active [...] the result is the general effervescence that is characteristic of revolutionary or creative epochs. The result of that heightened activity is a general stimulation of individual energies. People live differently and more intensely than in nor- mal times [...] and once the individuals are gathered together, a sort of electri- city is generated from their closeness."15 As a result, the etiological frame of the fascist ethos manifests its existential-political pathogenesis in the co-existence of technical repression of heterogeneity, a-functional and un-productive mode of existence, collective anxiety, and the neurotic and convulsionary collective ener- getism that emerged from the shock of the war. Therefore, I sustain in this paper that the Fascist existential ethos represents a temporary epistemic and semantic void in the meta-narrative of rational-modernity; an epistemic and semantic void that escapes the flux of rational messages; like an innate tendency to rediscover an irrational "otherness" that negates the instrumental symbolic codes, norms, and discursive practices of everyday life; a void that resulted from the structural asynchrony16 between discourses of the integral technicization of</page><page sequence="7">400 ETC • October 2012 life and bio-aesthetic resistances against instrumental practices of denaturation (semantics of technicization), normativization, and disciplinary control on bodies, which tended to systematize and to control human life within quantifi- able and measurable set of functions. Nevertheless, from the permanence of reactive mystical tendencies in society, which have incessantly pointed toward the re-sacralization and re-energitization of the social body, a process of re- sacralization emerged earlier and between the wars, which escaped the "seman- tic" realm of technical and instrumental knowledge, implying an anti-functional movement toward the Dionysiac, orgiastic, irrational, and ecstatic; this release of a collective energetic surplus emerged as a reaction to an acute collective stress disorder. Thus, from the monotonous and neurotic character of the machine age, the dysfunctional relationship between sovereignty and "bare life," and the traumatic experience of the war, individuals transferred their repressed surpluses of mental and emotional energy to politics, demanding a new political aesthetic characterized by a vitalistic Weltanschauung, by an incessant and permanent mobilization and, above all, by an emotional cathexis between the Volk and its latent energy (Will). In modern techno-mechanistic civilization and in the "industrial killing" of World War I, individuals experi- enced the most extreme alienation, mental fatigue, anxiety, and neurasthenic symptoms. The ever-increasing technicization of life and the objectification of the body created the perspective within which the catastrophic fragmentation and "de-substantialization" of the breakdown of the community, and subse- quent genesis of false consciousness, were perceived (Kracauer). As a reaction to these socio-pathological conditions, fascism presented itself as a supra- temporal idealization of an heroic collective consciousness, creating a new palingenetic and socio-regenerative system of belief, myths, rites, and symbols imbued with youthful and irrational exuberance, a heroic ethos and an active/ dynamic vision of existence capable to objectify unconscious forms of excita- tion, violence, excess, delirium, and dream that escaped from the functional, homogeneous, and instrumental semantic of the everyday life.17 The creation of a new dramatic liturgy and the formulation of an aesthetic political theology emphasized the emotional experience of immediacy, promising to give back to alienated subjects that Kairotic eventfulnessls and ecstatic pathos that contained the energeia and ôova|xiç of the historical moment and the calling for a dynamic existence in opposition to the secularized and deteriorated conditions of ordin- ary life. In this "Kairotic eventfulness," in which history belongs to the present of consciousness and is therefore "entirely immanent in the act of its construc- tion,"19 Fascism appeared as an "eternal festivity" (Brasillach), a secularized religion, a collective ritual of re-energetization and a reanimating orgy where</page><page sequence="8">Fascism as a Semantic Void into the Meta-Narrative of Rational Modernity 401 imaginations and dreams transcended the neurotic uneasiness of modern rational-instrumentality. Nevertheless, in this aesthetico-existential political experience, the initial attempt to escape the mechanism of instrumental moder- nity was destined to fail since the existential ethos of fascism tended inevitably to institutionalize itself and to surrender its "heterogeneous semantic" to inter- nal paradigms of functional immunization and repression embedded in the disciplinary mechanisms of bio-modernity.20 The institutionalization - as a ten- dency to frame life in transcendental forms - of the fascist existential ethos, with its preservation of mystical and emotional ideologies, resulted in the dra- matic formation of a one-dimensional bio-power, ecstatically committed in the creation of the new fascist man and in the totalitarian and systematic control of bios and thanatos. From this transition, we can conclude that the fascist ethos, which theoretically and historically anticipates fascist totalitarian praxis, repre- sented an existential and vitalistic reaction against the integral technicization of life and the concomitant reduction of existence into a set of mathematical axioms (from here intellectuals fascination with fascism). This collective resis- tance resulted in the insertion of a temporary epistemic and semantic void into the meta-narrative of rational-modernity. Despite this "semantic void," internal mechanisms repressing heterogeneous, a-functional impulses have continued to normativize life and to generate bio-political discourses, triggering tragic pro- cesses of the institutionalization of this existential malaise. The process of insti- tutionalization corresponded to the permanence of an integral pathological vision of society, which determined the formation of a totalitarian bio-power that took control of life, death, and biological processes in order to forge, by brutal disciplinary mechanisms of regulation and repression, a succession of increasingly neurotic and de-humanized bio-apparata, which have only served to radicalize further the instrumental-mechanic and functional systems that it announced its intention to destroy. Notes and References 1 . Against the hypothetical reduction of human identity to an algebraic for- mula, George Bataille argued that "human activity is not entirely reduci- ble to processes of production and conservation, and consumption must be divided into two distinct parts. The first reducible part is represented by the use of the minimum necessary for the conservation of life and the continuation of individuals' productive activity in a given society [...] the second part is represented by so-called un-productive expenditure: luxury, mourning, war, cults, the construction of sumptuary monuments, games, spectacles, arts, perverse sexuality." In "The psychological structure of</page><page sequence="9">402 ETC • October 2012 fascism," Bataille transferred this dichotomy into a more sophisticated dialectic between homogeneous and heterogeneous forms of existence, where "homogeneity" signifies the commensurability of elements and the awareness of this commensurability: human relations are reduced to fixed rules based on the consciousness of the possible identity of delineable per- sons and situations. Production is the basis of homogeneity and "each man is worth what he produces [...] he stops being an existent for him- self," and becomes a function arranged within measurable and quantifi- able limits of collective production, which "makes him an existent for something other than himself." The protection of homogeneity requires a political sovereignty, which must exercise a power of normativization and disciplinary control on bodies "obliterating the various unruly forces and bringing them under the control of order." As a result "the most accom- plished and expressive forms of social homogeneity are the sciences and the technologies," which epistemologically tend to systematize nature in mathematical formulas On the contrary, Bataille argued, heterogeneity indicates "elements that are impossible to assimilate" and "its exclusion from the homogeneous realm of consciousness formally recalls the exclu- sion of the elements described as unconscious, which censorship excludes from the conscious ego." Therefore, heterogeneity can be described as an incommensurable something other, whose unconscious forms include states of excitation, violence, excess, delirium, sacredness, madness, and "the immense travail of recklessness, discharge and upheaval that consti- tutes life." All these heterogeneous forms result from un-productive expenditures and are characterized by an operation of loss and limitless degradation. Furthermore, Heterogeneous reality is "that of a force or shock [. . .] it presents itself as a charge passing from one object to another in a more or less abstract fashion, almost as if the change were taking place not in the world of objects but only in the judgment of the subject." As a result, the body, the emotions, and the experience of life are irreduci- ble to instrumental rationality: it seems as if the cyclical emergence of het- erogeneous symptoms derives from a silent epistemic void that escapes the flux of rational messages; like an innate tendency to rediscover an irra- tional "otherness" that negates the instrumental symbolic codes, norms, and discursive practices of everyday life. The implication is that if these unconscious forms are brought out in a temporary deficit of the homoge- neous system to take on "conscious" political forms, fascism will result incontestably as an archetypical and wicked expression of this heteroge- neous form of existence.

Leading from a systematic critique of various modes of "bourgeois thought" such as "Homeric epic," Bacon, Descartes, Kant, as well as counter- Enlightenment figures like Nietzsche and Sade, Adorno and Horkheimer suggested that the first manifestations of Enlightenment already revealed the project of "domination of nature": "What men want to learn from nature is how to use it in order wholly to dominate it and other men. That is the only aim. Ruthlessly, in despite of itself, the Enlightenment has extin- guished any trace of its own self-consciousness. The only kind of thinking that is sufficiently hard to shatter myths is ultimately self-destructive [...] power and knowledge are synonymous." See Theodore Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Dialectic of Enlightenment (New York, 1944), p. 4. 9. In the "Critique of pure reason," Kant synthesized Descartes and Leibniz with the Empiricism of Locke and Hume in order to produce a compre- hensive theory of the relationship between mind and world (transcendental idealism). Kant argued that the world of "phenomena," we experience is</page><page sequence="11">404 ETC • October 2012 shaped by the mind. Time, space, and causation did not belong to the world in itself but they were concepts that were applied to the world by the mind. These concepts were not learnt from experience, they were known a priori (prior to experience). Therefore, for Kant, the essential fea- tures of human experience were conceptual categories imposed on the world by reason in order to render the world meaningful. In accordance with Adorno and Horkheimer, Kant created a subject (a transcendental ego), who transcended the "real world" (history and nature) and contained within itself the Utopian idea of universality, order, hierarchical supervi- sion, and administration of the transcendental and empirical world. In Kant's rational gnoseology, Adorno and Horkheimer saw the connection between modernity and administration, and the power of rational-modern bureaucracy to control individuals by the imposition of rules and social norms, which eclipsed the uniqueness and individuality of the subject.

In the thinking of early Christianity and its historical consciousness, the meaning of Kairos moved from its Aristotelian ethical character</page><page sequence="12">Fascism as a Semantic Void into the Meta-Narrative of Rational Modernity 405 ("phronesis") and its rhetorical-linguistic forms, to a deeper and prophetic eschatological "substance" (Paul). Kairos, as fulfilled moment of creation, "the moment of time approaching us as fate and decision" - opposed to the timeless Logos, (and later to Lutheran transcendentalism) - announces, in its "fullness" and "resoluteness," the right time, when the eternal breaks into the temporal and that a new beginning can take place. This new Kaxaßo^f) (Katabole), under the chiliastic forms of a new 7Úcmç, in which Kairos (the right time) "actualize" the most authentic moment of vision, and in which the meaning of "revelation" assumes a new historical consciousness, breaks through the structures of human exis- tence, disclosing itself anew for knowledge and action. Whether, for Christian Faith, the appearing of Jesus as the Christ is the absolute and unique Kairos, in its general sense - for the philosopher of history - Kairos represents an "historical" turning point," the moment which occurs the coming of a new "revelation" "on the soil of a secularized and emptied autonomous culture" (Tillich). Kairos as Kotxaßo^r) and "moment of authentic vision" is always grounded in a time of tension and conflict, a time of "crisis," which implies that the course of events poses a fundamental question, which calls for an unconditioned and resolute deci- sion. In this ecstatic time, the consciousness of the crises take a living his- torical form, and the Being, grasped by its fate and destiny, suspends the ethical (the universal) in order to faithfully and intensely live the "new Revelation" - the moment of ecstatic vision (Augenblick). Paul Tillich has written some illuminating passages: "the believer stands in nature, taking upon oneself the inevitable reality; not to flee from it; either into the world of ideal forms or into the related world of super-nature, but to make decisions in concrete reality. Here the subject has no possibility of an absolute position. It cannot go out of the sphere of decision. Every part of its nature is affected by these contradictions.
