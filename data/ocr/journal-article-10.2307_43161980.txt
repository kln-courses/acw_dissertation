In general, books selected for the bibliography meet the following criteria: (1) accurate, (2) readable, and (3) pleasing format. Committee members considered the following: Does the book encourage indepen- dent work? If experiments are used, do they lead to some understanding of basic principles? Are they feasible and safe? Are facts and theories clearly distinguished? Are significant facts omitted? Are generalizations supported with facts? Are differing views presented on controversial subjects? Are animals and plants an- thropomorphized? and, Does the book violate our basic principles against racism, sexism, and violence? Each annotation* is initialed by the reviewer who wrote it and the ap- propriate grade level of the book is given in parentheses. The addresses of the publishers have been omitted in the interest of space. However, they are easily found in the monthly "Resources Reviews" section of S&amp;C or any library. * Please note: Although most of the books were read by mere than one committee member, annotations do not necessarily reflect the judgment of all committee members.
