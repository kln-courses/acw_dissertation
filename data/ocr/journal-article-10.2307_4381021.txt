<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARIO BELL IN I The first retrospective exhibition devoted to Milanese de- signer Mario Bellini continues through September 15. Or- ganized by Cara McCarty, Assistant Curator, Department of Architecture and Design, it features a broad selection of the furniture and industrial designs for which Bellini is best known. During a recent visit to New York, Mr. Bellini gave a slide presentation of his work in the imposing nine-story atrium of Center Two at the International Design Center New York (IDCNY) in Long Island City. "I have tried to retain in our machines:" he told the audience, "the value of our rela- tionship with the object as opposed to the relationship the object might have with what it contains' This emphasis, on the relationship between the designed object and its user - as opposed to the relationship of packaging to content, which had traditionally been the designer's prin- cipal concern-was the keynote of Bellini's talk. "Bellini emphasizes the tactile experience:' Cara McCarty explains in the exhibition catalog, "for he feels adults should explore the environment through their senses, like children. He makes industrial products desir- able by taking advantage of the expressive capabilities of such new materials as plastic, which lends itself to smooth, sculptural shapes, and can be formed into stretched membranes, evoking sensuous landscapes or the human body Even though the anthropomorphic refer- ences in his work may not be immediately recognizable, they stimulate an emotional response'. Mario Bellini was born in Milan in 1935 and graduated in architecture from the Milan Polytechnic in 1959. In 1963 he became the chief industrial design consultant for the Olivetti Company, an association that continues today He began his career, McCarty points out, "at a decisive mo- ment in the history of twentieth-century design: the transi- tion from mechanical to microelectronic technology"' The implications of this were discussed by Mr. Bellini with regard to his 1972 DIvIsUMMA 18 ELECTRONIC PRINTING CALCULATOR (above, right) whose design demonstrates Bellini's ability to make technology seem less intimidating. "It was one of the first personal calculating and printing machines' he told the audience. "The idea was to stay far away from the 'black box' When microelectronics came into our world, everything risked, and still risks, becoming an incomprehensible black box because microelectronics is cheap. The printed circuit board is always the same and everything can be put in a box with a few buttons and readout units. I think that would be a disaster for our relationship with the world around ust' "F ORTE Rosso" BENCH. 1985. Red Indian sandstone. Made for "The Golden Eye" exhibition at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, New York, 1985. "The Indian Govemment asked me and a few oth- ers to design something using Indian workmen and rt7aterials. It amused me, talking about indus- trial design, to design a bench produced by hand from one single piece of stone by one man. I like it very much"' CIc AB" SIDE CHAIR.1976. 4 Enameled steel frame, leather upholstery closed with zippers. Designed in collaboration with Centro Design e Communicazione, Cassina. "There is an inside steel frame and an oustide leather suit or jacket-I don't know what to call it. Put it on andzip it up and you get the chair The two parts of the chair cannot live without each other: its not covered by leather, it's made out of leather and steel." "B REAK" DINING CHAIR. 1' 1976. Steel frame, "self-skinning" polyurethane foam, and leather or fabric upholstery with leather piping, closed with zippers. "It belongs to a family of seats using very thin, flexible, soft panels which are a technological achievement: injected, self-standingpolyurethane foam, joined together by vertical zippers. As you change the fabric, the whole spirit of the chair changes. It conveys, perhaps, the idea of a seat- a very thin idea"</page><page sequence="2">ES 401 TEXT-EDITING 4SYSTEM. 1978. Cast-injected ABS plastic body and lid. Designed in collaboration with A. Macchi Cassia, G. Pasini, S. Pasqui. , * I rn1 - "The machine is not an isolated item; it is a part of 1 Iitwitlt l ; our cultural attitude, our behavior, even when working in an office. It occurred to me that my keyboard machines could be derived from the lec- tern, from a small, inclined surface used for writing and reading. Such a machine cannot be designed as a pure tool. It somehow has to be linked; it has a history because reading and writing did not just appear a few years ago. So even with a machine, you may recall the importance of our culture.' STER 20" TELEVISION. *I 1968. ABS plastic body. Designed in collaboration with Dario Bellini. "The attempt was to make a television set more than a hole for images. A television set switched off is still an object. We may want to look at the back of it; it's not always against the wall." D E S I G N E R Throughout his talk, Bellini emphasized the continuity between his earliest designs, like the 1965 P 101 ELEC- TRONIC DESKTOP COMPUTER (opposite page, top left) and his most recent pieces such as the 1985 - 86 ETP 55 PORTABLE ELECTRONIC TYPEWRITER (top center). The vents of the 1965 machine, evoking fish gills, have become rakish and shark-like on the underside of the typewriter. "I believe they show an interesting relationship:' he said. Both result from what "could be described as the attempt to domesticate our wild mechanical world, which is outside of us, through a rather zoomorphic or anthropomor- phic approach which may allow these machines to become more understandable to us and compatible with our bodies" Bellini is renowned not only for his industrial and con- sumer electronic designs, but for the furniture he has created. He received the first of seven Compasso d'Oro awards in 1962 for his first furniture design, a table. In designing furniture for Cassina, B &amp; B Italia, Vitra, and other firms, he has thoroughly exploited new technologies but, he remarked, "I don't think that contemporary high tech- nology necessarily means that we should have to sit on a piece of a mechanism' On the other hand, "we cannot go on making padded upholstery using nails and wooden frames. It would deny the present:. The covering of hi-tech design by a 'skin' that conveys an object's cultural, human significance "might be one of the ways of preserving what our long tradition has taught us' That tradition also poses a challenge. "To design a chair' Bellini remarked, "is certainly the most difficult task a designer or an architect has to face" because the architect or designer is approaching an object embedded in cultural history. Similarly, a table cannot be designed with only functional or technological problems taken into considera- tion. "A table is not a machine to raise a plate' Trained as an architect, Bellini has returned to its practice in the last few years. His architectural work will represent, he hopes, "the last part of my career"' The exhibition was designled by Bellini in collaboration with Agata Torricella, an architect in Bellini's studio. It is his first architectural project in the United States. Other current projects include an opera/theater complex in Tokyo with buildings that appear as "metaphysical presences" at one end of a plaza inspired by de Chirico, Bellini's favorite artist. MARIO BELLINI: DESIGNER has been made possible by generous support from Olivetti; Cassina, S.p.A.; Brion- vega; Lancia; Vitra Seating, Inc.; and Erco Leuchten. Addi- tional funding has been provided by the National Endow- ment for the Arts. COLONNATO TABLE. 1977. Marble. "Who said that a table must have four legs?" E BAMBOLE" SOFA. 4 1972. Differential density polyurethane, Dacron padding, fabric upholstery. "I see it now as a sofa reminding us of a sofa: an object very consistent with what that part of our living environment has always meant" amide-reinforced fiberglass cover; fabric uphol- stery. Designed in collaboration with Dieter Thiel. "I always liked to say that to design fumiture and to design a machine were so different because fur- niture has a long long history and doesn't change very much aside from little details, while machines may have a very short life and they continuously change because of technological obsolescence. Also, a machine has an additive or modular rather than an integrated organism as you have in a piece of fumiture. But when I started designing an office chair I had to reconsider all of my ideas. Because what is an office chair? It is, on the one hand, a machine, on the other a chair How can these two things be combined without compromise?"</page></plain_text>
