<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jordan Paper THE Feng IN PROTOHISTORIC CHINESE RELIGION This paper is a sequel to an earlier one, "The Meaning of the T'ao- t'ieh,"' which was a hermeneutical study of protohistoric Chinese ritual decor focusing on the Shang period (ending ca. 1040 B.c.E.).2 In it, I briefly dealt with bird motifs replacing the t'ao-t'ieh, the primary Shang design motif composed of an ascending lung (dragon) combined with a horned mask helmet in the subsequent Chou period, noting the bird's common symbolic function as an indicator of shamanistic flight. However, further reflections and new evidence from recently excavated pieces indicate that the significance of the primary motif of very early Chou dynasty ritual decor is far more complex than I had assumed and has led to the following study. A version of this paper was delivered before the Thirty-first International Congress of Human Sciences in Asia and North Africa held at Tokyo and Kyoto, August 30- September 8, 1983. 1 am grateful to William Boltz and Norman Girardot for some of the following references.

Art historians specializing in Chinese artifacts, especially ancient bronzes, focus on decor from the standpoint of stylistic development.3 In doing so, many scholars have ignored the decor's content and context, viewing the motifs as totally abstract designs. One can take, as an example, the major school of stylistic analysis descending from Ludwig Bachhofer (1894-1976) to Max Loehr and his students.4 Some scholars from this school have reached the extreme view that the decor had no meaning at all: "Neither the dragon nor the bird is of much importance for its own sake; any too precise definition of anatomical parts would jeopardize more impor- tant ends. Each motif is valued only insofar as it lends itself to an over-riding ornamental purpose and provides a graceful flow of elaborate curvelinear shapes."5 In contrast, a historian of religions would consider it unlikely that the decor on ritual objects central to a religion's practices had no religious significance. Other art historians throughout the twentieth century have discussed the meaning of decor but without the methodologies available to modern historians of re- ligions.6 Contemporary Chinese scholars assume the decor had mean- ing recoverable through the methods of paleographic analysis but do not consider such study of major importance. Nevertheless, they do accept that "the customs of the Shang were closely related to their bronze decor."7 EARLY CHOU RITUAL DECOR8 In "The Meaning of the T'ao-t'ieh," I discussed the disappearance of the t'ao-t'ieh motif following the Chou conquest of the Shang and its replacement on the same part of the vessel by bird images.9 Mentioned were vessels from the second set found at Pao-chi Hsien in Shensi Province, the traditional home of the Chou. Max Loehr thought these vessels may have been manufactured by a late Shang artisan for 3 Bernhard Karlgren studied the bronze decor from the standpoint of linguistic struc- ture but to the same effect. 4 My original training in Chinese bronzes was within this school under another of Bachhofer's students, Harrie Vanderstappen, over two decades ago. While I accept its stylistic theories, I no longer agree with its position on the lack of meaning in the matter of decor. 5 Robert W.

Of similar appearance is the yu excavated in Hunan Province in 1970. Although found to the south of the Chou homeland, it was not associated with a tomb burial but was found alone filled with jade discs, indicating that it had been carried there at a later date.12 These vessels all have facing birds of the Shang type (found only on upper friezes or as lid handles) in the central frieze where the t'ao-t'ieh would normally be found. Also associated with the Pao-chi sets are vessels that are unquestion- ably of early Chou type with non-Shang-style bird decor. These vessels include a kuei with the early Chou inverted cup lid and high square foot.13 Similar to this vessel is the Brundage kuang,'4 and an almost identical piece in the Princeton Art Museum that Loehr considers predynastic Chou.l5 These vessels have early versions of the Chou bird motif with large rearward-sweeping crest (see fig. IA). A third type of vessel that may be predynastic Chou or transitional is the Brundage ting with bird-shaped legs, the body of the vessel itself retaining the t 'ao-t'ieh design.16 Among the earliest datable (by inscription) Chou vessels, the Brundage square ting, excavated from a royal tomb near Feng-hsing of the Chou homeland, has legs similar to the above-mentioned ting, but with crested bird design as well. 7 Its plastic decor is of the transitional type: that is, without the inscription, the piece may well have been considered late Shang. The bird decor on this vessel has a forward-pointed head of the Shang type; more typical of early Chou 10 Max Loehr, Ritual Vessels of Bronze Age China (New York: Asia Society, 1968), pp. 98-99. 11 For the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, see Loehr, pl. 41; for the Minneapolis Museum of Art, see Loehr, pi. 40; for the Freer Gallery of Art, see John Alexander Pope et al., The Freer Chinese Bronzes (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1967), vol. 1, no. 50 (the editors consider that the vessel "might have been cast by Chou bronze artisans before the conquest of the Shang"); and for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, see William Watson, Ancient Chinese Bronzes (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1962), pl. 21a. 12 Fong, ed., pi. 25.

Two examples of very early Chou pieces with the typical Chou bird decor are the yu excavated in 1959 in Anhwei18 and the Buckingham tsun.19 A second relatively common type of early Chou ritual decor motif is the elephant. Although vessels in the shapes of elephants were produced in the Shang period, for example, the Freer tsun20 and the one excavated in 1975,21 only on early Chou vessels do elephants take the place of the t'ao-t'ieh as the main frieze decor. One early Chou type is the elephant-headed figure with spiral body; for example, the set of four vessels excavated in Shansi Province in 1971.22 Although this design is not always considered to represent an elephant (as it has a clawed foreleg), the extension of the curled upper lip into a long protuberance with double curve and split, flaired end is unquestion- ably meant to represent the trunk of a trumpeting elephant (see fig. 2A). The identification of the head of the body as that of an elephant is confirmed by the Buckingham kuei with shape and main decor similar to the kuei of the above set.23 However, the design replacing the t'ao-t'ieh on the high foot has raised-wing and feathered- body creatures with unmistakably realistic elephant heads ill fitting the bodies (see fig. 2B). A logical conclusion would be that the foot design is a more explicit version of the vessel-body design, that the spiral-bodied monster represents a flying elephant-headed bird, and that the spirals represent an abstraction of winged bodies. 18 Tresors d'art chinois (Paris: Petit Palais, 1973), no. 95. 19 Charles Fabens Kelly and Ch'en Meng-chia, Chinese Bronzes from the Buckingham Collection (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago, 1946), pi. 23. 20 Pope et al., no. 40. 21 Fong, ed.

Also supporting the elephant identification is a kuei excavated near Peking in 1974 with clearly depicted full-bodied elephants as t'ao- t'ieh replacement decor;24 this design has been related to the set excavated in 1971.25 The vessel is supported by four legs representing elephant trunks protruding from animal mouths; two of these trunks descend from bird-shaped handles. A similar handle, except that the elephant trunk is upturned, is on an early Chou kuang excavated in 1976; the rest of the vessel is of Shang-like appearance with a normal t ao-t'ieh design.26 On a kuei in the Pillsbury Collection, the head of a similar bird handle is replaced by an explicitly depicted elephant's head with raised trunk and protruding tusks.27 Another early Chou tsun in the Shanghai Museum with t'ao-t'ieh design has four plastic elephant heads with upturned trunks on the shoulder of the vessel.28 The clearly repesented elephant trunks descending from the bird handles indicate that the bottom appendages to the bird handles, found in vessels as early as the predynastic Chou period, are ab- stracted elephant trunks. For example, on the previously mentioned Princeton and Brundage kuang, there are two appendages dropping from the bird handle. The forward one has a curled split end as an elephant trunk. The elephant-headed bird motif is on a square-footed kuei, excavated at the proto-Chou capital of Ch'i-shou, that is dated by inscription to the first year of King Wen's victory over the Shang.29 24 Fong, ed., pl. 57. 25 Ibid., p. 212.

The sweeping crest of the bird decor becomes lengthy and elabo- rate,30 occasionally taking on circles that give the plumage an appear- ance of a peacock's tail feathers.31 In this regard, a vessel excavated in 1955 in Liaoning Province and tentatively dated to the third Chou reign is of particular interest to later discussion. Described as having "the motif of the crested dragon with a bird's body"32 (the head may be that of the elephant as it is similar to the spiral-bodied figures), the crest ends in an anthropomorphic design exactly in the shape of the early Chou glyph wang (king), including the upturned ends of the bottom bar. The spread cheek pieces of the horned mask helmet33 form the upper bar, the extended arms form the middle bar, and the legs, in a nonanthropomorphic spread, form the lower bar (see fig. 3). (If a human form only were intended, the legs would have formed rather an inverted V.)34 Within a century following the establishment of the Chou reign, both related design motifs, the crested bird and elephant bird, dis- appear, to be replaced by other design motifs.

Hence, this design probably represents the sun, and the subcircles represent the four directions. On each side of the circle design is a creature close in depiction to the elephant-headed bird motif, although the workman- ship is relatively crude for precise identification. The large handles consist entirely of an upturned elephant trunk, with the lower flange being the abstract elephant trunk design. SHANG BIRDS: OWL AND CROW (OR SWALLOW) Bird designs are found on late Shang period bronze vessels, but, except in the few cases of very late Shang vessels considered in the preceding section to be predynastic Chou in origin or commission, they do not appear in place of the t'ao-t'ieh. In particular, there are a number of vessels in the shape of an owl and at least one with an owl depicted on the side, but there is not a doubled image as in the t'ao- t'ieh.37 A noncrested bird appears frequently as a subsidiary frieze design element or as a lid handle. Interestingly, none of these designs appears on Chou period vessels. In current Chinese folklore, the cry of the owl is feared as a harbinger of death,38 as it is elsewhere-for example, in Northwest Coast Amerindian culture.39 In the Shih (Odes, ca. eighth to sixth centuries B.C.E.), the bird is briefly mentioned with a connotation of evil.40 Yet these connotations do not apply to the owl's plastic depic- tion on Shang sacrificial vessels since such symbols of a feared and 35 Fong, ed., pls. 50, 60. The square i is quite similar, especially in handle shape, to one in the Shanghai Museum, although the central frieze decor is more ambiguous in import. This vessel is linked by inscription to the Shansi set but is more precisely dated to the reign of King I.

However, in the history of religions one can find other symbolic uses of the the owl. In the Ojibwa religion of aboriginal North America, the owl is also related to death, but not in a fearful manner: "No. 113 [the sign on a birchbark scroll] represents the Ko-ko-ko-o' (Owl) passing from the Mide-wigan to the Land of the Setting Sun, the place of the dead, upon the road of the dead, indicated by the pathway at No. 114."4' This concept of the owl as a vehicle from the realm of the living to the realm of the dead, which is the abode of the ancestral spirits in early China, would correspond closely to the concept of the Shang Chinese lung. The lung, as part of the major Shang sacrificial vessel design motif, rises from the earth to the sky, the abode of Shang ti (supreme power or power on high).42 The noncrested bird is often identified as a swallow; it has been noted that "the swallow is everywhere regarded as sacred."43 Accord- ing to the origin myth of the Shang ruling clan, they were descended from a woman, Chien Ti, into whose mouth a hsian-niao (dark bird), usually considered by commentators to be the swallow, dropped an egg.44 This identification of the hsuan-niao with a swallow is first cited in the Lu-shih ch'un-ch'iu, a third-century B.C.E. work. Accord- ing to a recent article by Sarah Allan, "the black bird which gave birth to the Shang thus seems originally to have been undifferentiated with regard to species, but in color matches the sun-bird."45 The crow or raven is considered the sun bird from the mid-Chou period on (see the following section, Crow). Allan persuasively argues "that the Shang rulers had a totemic relationship with the ten suns which were also thought to be birds."46 Either swallow or crow/raven fits the noncrested bird design on the Shang bronzes, but crow as ancestral sunbird now seems the more likely identification.47 41 W.

In Japan, the pheasant is generally viewed as a messenger to the Shinto deities.51 (In central India, the peacock is a clan symbol to which offerings are made.)52 On a Chinese silk covering a saddle blanket that was found frozen in a Siberian tomb and dendrochronologically and carbon dated to the sixth to fourth centuries B.C.E., three birds are depicted: a small, single-crested bird with a partridge gait; a single-crested, long-tailed, pheasant-appearing bird with a pheasant gait; and a bird somewhat different in appearance from the preceding with a double-crested, long split tail and rearward-turning head (see fig. 1B).53 The last is identical with the earlier Chou bronze decor motif and confirms that the bird depicted is, at least in part, a type of pheasant, or a game bird similar to a pheasant. In the later, traditional period of Chinese history, the feng is the female complement of the lung and serves as an ascent vehicle for female hsien ("immortals"-persons with shamanistic attributes). For example, after Hsiao Shih, the legendary flautist ascribed to the sixth century B.C.E., taught his wife Lung-yii to play the flute, they both ascended to the sky, he riding a lung and she a feng. However, contrary to the point I made in my earlier paper on the t'ao-t'ieh in regard to the early Chou period, the early meaning of the feng is distinct from the later one. There are two major aspects of the early Chou feng image: sun cock and ancestral spirit. with the feng.) However, the name graph is considered to refer to women of the Yu- jung clan who married Shang kings rather than the founding mother of the Shang. Furthermore, the name is found in a collection of inscriptions, making it difficult to date the vessel by decor. (Allan, p. 316, fig. 2; p. 317.) 48 W.

Percival Yetts points out that, with the name of "The Vermillion Bird," the feng presides over the southern quadrant and represents the sun and warmth of summer.54 The niao-hsing (bird star or con- stellation) identified with the chu ch'iao (the Red Bird) at the center of the southern palace (the Vermillion Bird) was one of the two most important constellations that may have been recognized by the Shang.55 This bird was written on the oracle bones with a crested bird glyph.56 In myths of New Britain in Melanesia, parrots and cockatoos (both crested birds as in the early representation of the feng) are the sun.57 Wolfram Eberhard suggests that the divine cock in the sun and on the sun tree may be the models for the feng.58 The identity of birds with ancestral spirits is common and extends from Africa to the Solomon Islands and to Polynesia.59 Closer to China, the Ania of Taiwan "never partake of chicken, believing that fowls are the abode of good, gentle [ancestral?] spirits."60 Waterbury suggests that there had been a cult of bird deities that existed outside of the official religion and that may have been Tungistic in origin.61 However, the evidence does not necessitate the interpretation of a separate cult: "The present-day Jakuts, Tungus and Dolgons still set up rows of wooden birds on poles at burial grounds. They represent the mundane form of the spirit and other dead souls whom the dead men once helped or served."62 The odes of the Shih are but a century or two younger than the later bronzes under discussion and incorporate earlier material. In the odes, particular birds are auspicious in regard to their appearance: 54 Yetts, p. 24. Couling describes the feng as the product of the sun or fire, but this may not be a Chinese concept (Samuel Couling, Encyclopedia Sinica [Shanghai, 1917], p. 436). 55 Joseph Needham, Science and Civilization in China (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1959), 3:242. 56 Ibid., p. 244, fig. 92. Some scholars have argued that this interpretation is mistaken, that the oracle glyph read as niao does not signify bird and hsing does not signify constellation. At present, there is no definite consensus on reading the glyphs. 57 Katherin Luomala, Oceanic, American Indian and African Myths of Snaring the Sun, Bernice P.

The phoenixes [feng] go flying, xwad-xwad their wings; again they settle and then stop; a great crowd are the king's many fine officers, the lord gives them their charge; they have love for the Son of Heaven. The phoenixes go flying, xwad-xwad their wings; they even reach heaven; a great crowd are the king's many fine officers, the lord appoints them; they have love for the common people. The phoenixes sing on the high ridge, the eloeococcas grow on that east- facing [literally: sunny-side] slope; they are dense and luxuriant; (they sing) harmoniously and in unison.66 In this context, it is unclear as to whether thefeng is a solar spirit per se, but it is a spirit that arrives at auspicious occasions, including sacrifice, with south and sun-facing attributes. The feng on the ritual bronzes must be understood in the context of sacrifice since that is the function of the bronze vessels. Bernhard Karlgren has pointed out that, to the Chou, "the gods did not accept sacrificial gifts from such as were not of their kin."67 The Chou ruling clan offered ancestral sacrifices at four altars: to K'u, the formal father of Hou Chi (the Lord of Millet-his mother was impregnated 63 Bernhard Karlgren, trans., The Book of Odes (Stockholm: Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 1950), no. 171, verse 4. 64 Ibid., no. 215, verse 1. 65 "Yin is synonymous with the 'air, melody' of Odes 259, 260... an 'Air of the South.'"

Yuan K'o argues that Ti Chun was the direct ancestor of the Shang as well.71 In Han period texts, the mothers of the mythical founders of both the Shang and Chou dynasties had the same husband. Chow Tse-tsung notes that, "If this is true, the royal houses of the two dynasties must have originated from the same ancestor or clan."72 But the merging of the two ruling clans into a primordial single one seems to be a relatively late concept, perhaps a conflation of two separate traditions with bird or even sun- bird linkages. Bird-headed spirits are mentioned in references at least as early as the mid-Chou period: "Prince Mu of Ts'in [Ch'in] (658-619 B.C.) in clear daylight, in the middle of the day, was in a temple, when a Shen god (Spirit) entered the door and stood to the left. He had a human face and a bird's body."73 There are examples of human-headed, bird-bodied jade figures (e.g., Chicago Field Museum of Natural History no. 91153 and Freer Gallery no. 42.6) dated to the early Chou or the Shang period,74 but the dating of early jades is less certain than for bronzes. On late Chou bronze vessels, there are depicted human-headed figures with bird bodies and human legs with snakes in horn location on the heads.75 But these last figures can readily be linked to Yu-chiang, Agent of the North, found in the Shan-hai ching.76 68 For a summary and discussion of this myth, see Chang (n. 44 above), p. 168. 69 Noah Fehl, Li, Rites and Propriety in Literature and Life (Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 1971), p. 48. 70 Karlgren, "Legends and Cults in Ancient China," p. 214 ff. 71 Yuan K'o, Chung-kuo ku-tai shen hua [Ancient Chinese deities] (Shanghai: Com- mercial Press, 1957), p. 144; and Allan (n. 45 above), pp. 290-326, esp. pp. 313-17. 72 Chow Tse-tsung, "The Childbirth Myth and Ancient Chinese Medicine: A Study of Aspects of the Wu Tradition," in Ancient China: Studies in Earl)' Civilization, ed.

In the Shih, ode no. 235, verse 1, states: Wen Wang [King Wen] is on high, oh, he shines in heaven; though Chou is an old state, its (heavenly) appointment was not new; the house of Chou became amply illustrious, was not the appointment of God timely? Wen Wang ascends and descends [as a spirit, to accept sacrificial gifts],81 he is on the left and right of God.82 In a preceding section, it was pointed out that, on one unique vessel, the plume from the bird's head ends in an anthropomorphic design similar to the early Chou glyph for wang (king). I suggest that this glyph indicates that the bird (or elephant bird) symbolizes the Chou dynastic ancestor, King Wen. This vessel was manufactured only several generations after King Wen died; indeed, it has been argued by Ch'en Meng-chia that the vessel was made by a grandson of King Wen (Marquis Chih, the son of Duke Shao).83 Herrlee G. Creel, in discussing the relationship between T'ien (Heaven) and King Wen in regard to receiving sacrificial offerings, points out, "T'ien [may be a] group of ancestral Kings as a body, among whom King Wen is an outstanding individual."84 If the interpretation of the glyph as referring to King Wen is correct, then the bird decor on the early Chou 77 Chang, "A Classification of Shang and Chou Mythology" (n. 44 above), p. 157. 78 For discussion, see Michael Loewe, Ways to Paradise (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1979), pp. 50-51. 79 Chow, p. 60. 80 Allan (n. 45 above), pp. 312-13. 81 Following Chu Hsi's interpretation that the poem concerns the spirit of Wen Wang descending to receive sacrifices made to him. 82 Karlgren, The Book of Odes (n. 64 above). 83 Fong, ed.

ELEPHANT BIRD The elephant-headed bird and elephant-trunk motifs are exactly con- temporaneous with thefeng motif; the two designs arise and disappear at the same time on similarly shaped vessels. It is tempting, therefore, to assume that the two designs had similar significance, but the material available for interpretation of the elephant bird and elephant trunk is far sparser than for thefeng. A reference to a lung-feng-elephant85 concept does exist in Chinese literature but provides not even a hint as to its meaning. The Shan- hai ching, in the section on the north, states that on Yang (solar- masculine power) Mountain, "there are birds whose appearance is that of the female pheasant, are decorated with the five brilliant colors [a common description of the feng], and can change their sex. They are called hsiang-she (elephant serpents). Their cries can be heard for a distance."86 Unfortunately, no mention is made as to why these magical birds on Yang Mountain who are described asfeng are given a name that could readily describe the figure depicted on the Buckingham bronze: an elephant-headed, trumpeting, serpent-like bird.87 Aside from elephant tusks mentioned as tribute, the only reference to elephants or elephant decor in ritual is in the Li chi (Record of ritual-a second-century B.C.E. work supposedly representing earlier 85 This is a far different combination than some Americanists incorrectly assume when reading Quetzalcoatl into the early Chinese material: e.g., "Are there then biopsychological explanations rather than culture-historical ones for the parallels in ancient Chinese ritual art to the feline-reptilian-avian symbol complex of the New World?.... The 'dragon' is the synthesis of these three cosmic elements, as is the 'Feathered Serpent' of Mesoamerica" (Peter T. Furst, Hallucinogens and Culture [San Francisco: Chandler &amp; Sharp, 1976], p. 56). 86 Shan-hai ching, 3:47. (My translation.) 87 Carl Hentze has argued that a design motif on Yang-shao culture pottery repre- sents mammoth tusks and symbolizes the spring sun (Carl Hentze, Objets rituels, croyances et dieux de la Chine antique et de I'Amerique [Anvers: Editions "de Sikkel," 1936], p. 83 ff.). However, the mammoth disappeared from northern Asia at least eight thousand years ago, and the particular artifacts were described from Hsin-tien in Kansu Province (northwest China) (see G. D. Wu, Prehistoric Pottery in China [London: Kegan, Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., 1938], pp. 105-6). They are from an aeneolithic culture dating no earlier than the close of the second millennium B.C.E. (Chang Kwang-chih, The Archeology of Ancient China, 3d ed. [New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1977], p. 408). These same design elements Karlgren considers as representing thunder in conjunction with solar symbols, but he does not link them to elephant tusks (Bernhard Karlgren, "Some Fecundity Symbols in Ancient China," Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities 2 [1930]: 50). 226</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions ritual): "Above, in the hall of the ancestral temple, there was a jar with clouds and hills represented on it, on the east, and that with the victim represented on it, on the west.... The ruler appeared at the top of the steps to the east; his wife was in the apartment on the west. The great luminary [sun] makes his appearance in the east; the moon makes her appearance in the west .... The ruler fills his cup from the jar with the elephant on it; his wife fills hers from that with clouds and hills."88 The text interprets the decor as representing a sacrificial victim. Although elephants were occasionally sacrificed in the Shang period, by the time the work was written, the elephant had long disappeared from north China, and its original significance already may have been lost. Indeed, the elephant may have disappeared by the late tenth century B.c.E.,89 for included in the Chiang-po tomb vessels excavated in Shensi Province in 1974 was one in the shape of an elephant. However, except for the upraised trunk, the animal depicted is only vaguely elephantine; the body resembles a pig. This appearance could be due to poor craftsmanship-none of the Chiang-po vessels is of high quality-or to lack of observation of an actual elephant90-the Shang elephant vessels were quite realistically sculptured. A phenomenological interpretation of the complete pas- sage from the Li chi would clearly indicate that the elephant decor signifies solar-masculine-celestial power in contrast to the symbolism of the moon-feminine-earth syndrome represented on the vessel used by the ruler's wife. Except for the few early Chou vessels where the complete elephant is depicted, the elephant-headed bird or elephant trunk alone has the trunk raised and curled back, the posture of a trumpeting elephant (which would correspond to the loud sound of the Shan-hai ching description). Hence, the elephant could represent celestial thunder, which, along with the solar symbol of the late tenth-century vessels previously mentioned, may suggest celestial yang power, as does the lung, and the abode of ancestral spirits. In south and southeast Asia, the elephant symbolizes storms and rain and is also linked to serpents, the horned serpent being a ubiquitous rain image. Edouard Chavannes observes that elephants, especially white ones, are the mount of Indra.91 According to Eveline 88 James Legge, trans., Li Ki, vol. 27 of Sacred Books of the East, ed. F. Max Miiller (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1885), book 8, sec. 2, pp. 410-11. 89 But may have still remained in the Yangtze River area (Eberhard [n. 59 above], p. 262). 90 Chung-kuo ku-tai ch 'ing-t'ung ch ' chi, pl. 40. Another vessel in the set (pl. 42) has a frieze on the shoulder with elephant birds on either side of the sun whorls. 91 Edouard Chavannes, ed. and trans., Cinq cents contes et apologues (Paris: Ernest Leroux, 1910), no. 342. 227</page><page sequence="16">Protohistoric Chinese Religion Poree-Maspero: "It should be noted that the Hindus also sometimes call elephants nagi [serpent], perhaps because of the resemblance of the trunk to a serpent."92 In Thailand, the royal white elephant was thought to have the power to bring rain, and, in Cambodia, a dream of an elephant was the forecast of rain.93 More tenuous would be an interpretation that links the elephant bird, like thefeng, to ancestral spirits. However, according to legends well established at least by the fourth century B.C.E.,94 the sage-ruler Shun had a younger brother named Hsiang (elephant), and Shun is provided with links to the feng in regard to his birth and clothes.95 Hsiang was invested by Shun with an area called Yu-pi ("having a nose"), a name, which in emphasizing nose, Yuan K'o points out, could signify an elephant's trunk.96 Eberhard believes Yu-pi was located in south China where, at least as early as the third century C.E., there was a temple for Hsiang that was considered effective in bringing clouds and rain.97 Eberhard links an aspect of one version of the legend-"Shun plows wet-fields and hangs together with thunder swamp"-with the "elephant which, in turn, is connected with wet- field agriculture, rain and fertility."98 Unfortunately, the early Chou relationship of Shun to Hsiang, if any, is unknown, but the linkage to thunder, given the uniformity of the upraised trunk in regard to the motif, is fairly certain. CROW The feng design disappears from Chinese ritual bronzes within a century of the Chou conquest, and the elephant trunk motif disappears slightly later, along with the shapes on which these decor elements occurred. Sometime after the tenth century B.C.E., the feng begins to take on what will become its traditional feminine ascent connotations and no longer will have solar connections nor be symbolic of the Chou dynasty clan ancestors, both of which have masculine connota- tions. Included with the Chiang-po vessels, among which are what may be the last of the elephant-trunk decor vessels, is one in the 92 Eveline Poree-Maspero, Etude sur les rites agraires des Cambodgiens, 3 vols.

In the later Han-shu version which may incorporate an earlier variant tradition, the "pi" of Yu-pi is written with a character implying an elephant's trunk. In the Mencius it is noted that Hsiang's enfeoffment was also understood as banishment (Meng-tzu: 5.A.3); Hsiang is portrayed as exemplifying malicious behavior. 97 Eberhard (n. 59 above), p. 266. 98 Ibid., p. 26. 228</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions shape of a three-legged bird, which commentators have noted may be possibly linked to the later three-legged sun crow but appears to resemble more closely a turtledove.99 However, the shift from sun cock to sun crow may be as late as the fourth century B.C.E.; in the Shan-hai ching, the sun birds on the Fu-sang tree are identified as crows.'00 Certainly, by the end of the Chou period, the solar symbol is the crow in the sun, as illustrated in the second-century B.C.E. shroud excavated at Ma-wang-tui. The raven/crow as sun symbol is a circumpacific motif found in Siberia as well as among the Northwest Coast Amerindian cultures.?10 Indeed, the raven/crow sun symbol is connected to the sun-shooting myths that Eduard Erkes has shown to have East Asian-Amerindian correspondences.102 If Allan is correct in identifying the hsuan-niao as sun crow, then sometime between the tenth and fourth centuries the sun cock introduced by the Chou ruling clan is replaced by the earlier Shang concept of sun crow. An early date for the sun crow in northern China would more logically coincide with the northern circumpacific distribution of the motif. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS In the preceding section, it has been established that the decor on the early Chou sacrificial bronzes is distinctly different from that of the Shang. This decor, which continues for approximately a century, consists of two related motifs. One is a crested bird identical to a probable game bird embroidered on a mid-Chou silk. The second is a trumpeting, elephant-headed, flying bird. Both designs replace in position and orientation the t'ao-t'ieh, the primary design on the Shang sacrificial vessels. On one vessel, the crest plumes end in an anthropomorphized glyph, wang (king). The crested bird is most likely the early version of thefeng, an important feminine religious symbol from the late Chou period to the present. The early version of the feng is a masculine, solar-ancestral spirit, in part, the Chou equivalent of the Shang sun-bird symbol-crow.

From this analysis of early Chou ritual decor, tentative conclusions concerning Chou religion can be developed. Christopher Hawkes has delineated a fourfold scale of ascending difficulty and descending validity in archaeological interpretation, beginning with technology and ending in religion: "In general, I believe, unaided inference from material remains to spiritual life is the hardest inference of all."'03 Although, in protohistoric China, we are concerned with "text-aided" archaeology,'04 the inscriptional remains are little different. We learn from them far more about the political structure than about underlying cultural concepts that are assumed, not stated. Chang Kwang-chih has noted that "the Chinese did not describe or even talk about their own institutions, at least in the existing record, until late Chou,"'05 and Noah Fehl has pointed out that "myth and ritual come into literature only seldom before they have ceased to be unquestionably accepted and followed in life."'06 Neither scholar assumes that we should not concern ourselves with these concepts. For the Chinese ritual bronzes, we at least know what they are and approximately how they were used. Granted that the precise instruc- tions in the later ritual texts are proscriptive rather than descriptive, the earlier material in the Shih does provide a general outline of the procedures. Cyril F. Fox has pointed out, in regard to the European bronze age, that "archeology is incapable of dealing with myth, but ritual it can ... recover and analyze and appreciate."'07 For the Chinese bronze age, we are in a more fortunate situation, for we have in the early strata of the Shu and the Shih, as well as in inscriptional data, ancestral concepts and mythic remnants.'08 While we cannot be certain of the meaning of ritual motifs and their relationship to myth, we can create hypotheses that are plausible within the context of protohistoric Chinese religion. According to the Chinese myth of dynastic succession, the initial three dynasties, the Hsia, Shang, and Chou, were three successive 103 Christopher Hawkes, "Archeological Theory and Method: Some Suggestions from the Old World," American Anthropologist 56 (1954): 162.

Luckert, Olmec Religion [Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1976]). 230</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions cultures, each built on the other. In this model, Chou religion would be a borrowing of the Shang and not readily distinguishable. Chang Kwang-chih has stressed that there is "no evidence [in the archaeo- logical manifestions of the Shang and Chou civilizations] whatsoever for any discontinuity, implicit or explicit."'09 Cheng Te-k'un wrote, "The Chou people started their existence very close to the Shang people. They followed the Shang culture in practically every respect. Their material remains show hardly any difference from those of their predecessors. We may even go as far as to say the typical Shang culture continued to flourish until the fall of the central power at the end of the Western Chou."'' Modern archaeology, especially with the use of dendrochrono- logically amended radio-carbon dating, has indicated that in actuality the three cultures chronologically overlapped and were all descended from different loci of late neolithic culture."' That in the eleventh century B.C.E. the Chou ruling clan conquered the Shang ruling clan is not questioned, but the idea that the Chou were only recently civilized by copying the Shang is another matter. Certainly there were important differences between the religions of the two related cultures. The ritual practices of the two seem to have been basically the same: sacrifices were made by the ruling clan chieftain, the king, with the assistance of leading members of the clan and other allied ones, and consisted of a banquet offered to the clan ancestors as well as other spirits and powers. Theologically, however, there appear to have been differences. Chang has pointed out that, in the Chou period, "Shang Ti now becomes divorced from any identification with the Shang ancestors and the world of gods and the world of ancestors become two distinctly different worlds."'12 Chang places the reason for this shift in political expediency since the Shang ruling clan (Tzu clan) had identified its ancestors with Shang Ti, and the Chou ruling clan (Chi clan) would not, of course, accept the Tzu clan's conception of its power and the influence of its ancestral spirits. The religious difference, however, may be more far-reaching. Not only do the Chou appear to have placed more sacrificial emphasis on the clan ancestors, but the Chou clan ancestor, Hou Chi, the Lord of Millet, implies greater emphasis on agriculture by the Chou than by the Shang. This interpretation would only be enhanced 109 Chang Kwang-chih, "Changing Relations of Men and Animals in Shang and Chou Mythology and Art," Earli Chinese Civilization (see n. 44 above), p. 191.

The Shang bird motifs are not found on Chou vessels, and, assuming that the vessels with the earliest bird motifs replacing t'ao-t'ieh motifs were made for predynastic Chou rulers, the primary early Chou motifs, thefeng and the elephant bird, are not found on Shang vessels. "The sudden rise of the bird motif to a position of dominance on several families of bronze vessels in the early Chou period, whatever its signifi- cance in terms of dynastic change or religious orientation, was an important aspect of the revolution in both style and iconography.""16 Although the feng has been interpreted as a wind deity in the Shang period and, rather tenuously, a thunder deity in the Han,"7 the argument for a solar connection is stronger, as it is based on compara- tive as well as internal evidence."8 Of equal interest is the potential connection of the feng to ancestral spirits. The argument is based on a connection between a single verse in the Shih, from the Chou sacrificial odes, and a single vessel, that has been archaeologically excavated. The single case argument has been pointed out to me as 113 Wen I-to, "Chiang yian li ta-jen chi k'ao," Wen I-to ch'uan-chi, 2d ed. (Shanghai, 1948), 1:73-80. 114 Except for one or two examples, the chueh and chia seem not to have been manufactured by the Chou. 115 For example, a kuei dated to the eighth day after the Chou conquest and excavated in 1976 in Shansi Province has the t'ao-t'ieh decor but also has bird handles and the high, square Chou foot (Fong, ed. [n. 5 above], pl. 41). 116 Pope et al. (n. 11 above), 1:327. Furthermore, it is a different bird motif-the crested bird-than the noncrested Shang design, a fact which refutes some imaginative suggestions: e.g., the suggestion that the tribal emblems of the conquered people "once feared but now subjugated and pacified" were given prominent places on the arts of the ruling dynasty. Thus, the "Shang 'phoenix'. . . played the same role during the dynastic transition in the arts of its new master, the Chou aristocrats."

However, while this hypothesis may be considered in regard to the symbolism of the crane as a familiar of the hsien. it is less plausible in regard to pheasants. Sympathetic as I am to a pharmacologic substratum of myth, here, I believe, the symbolic explanation is still the most feasible. See Allison Bailey Kennedy, "Ecce Bufo: The Toad in Nature and in Olmec Iconography," Current Anthropology 33 (1982): 273-90. 232</page><page sequence="21">weak,"9 but I would counter that the opposite may hold with respect to ritual motifs. Commonly understood symbols are not commented on within a culture and could be most ambiguous to those without. For example, how would the simple Protestant cross be understood by future archaeologists if the Gospels had been an oral tradition? It is the odd example that is explicit and, if linked to mythic material, may explicate the larger number of implicit symbols. The interpretation of the feng as symbolic of ancestral spirits, bolstered by important comparative associations, matches the pre- viously noted Chou emphasis on ancestral spirits in comparison with the Shang. If the link between Hou Chi and the Fu-sang tree is early, then we have the connection between the solar and ancestral attributes of the feng as suggested in the Shih, odes 235 and 252, cited above. In the former, the character translated as "shines in heaven" literally means "bright," and the character contains the sun radical. Thefeng, therefore, may represent the Chou ancestral spirits to whom sacrifices are made-King Wen, for example-in their descent to receive the offerings. These ancestral spirits have a solar connotation, the most visible symbol of celestial power, essential to agriculture. One might speculate that the origin of the tradition of the (northern) Chinese ruler facing south is that only he can face the ancestral spirits symbolized by the sun. Allan has linked the Shang ancestors totemically with the ten suns symbolized by ravens, which may be the noncrested birds found on the Shang sacrificial vessels. She suggests that "this system was specific to the Shang and lost its integrity when the Shang ... were conquered by the Zhou [Chou] whose mythology only included a single sun."'20 Hence, the Shang may have had both the ten sun birds as ancestral totemic spirits, symbolized by crow/raven, as well as the single astral, crested sun cock (niao-hsing), while the Chou had only the single sun cock, which they identified with the ancestors. Approximately a century following the Chou conquest, both the decor and shapes of the bronze vessels noticeably change. The feng disappears as a design motif and apparently shifts in its significance from a masculine concept in its relationship to the sun and ancestral spirits to, by the end of the Chou period, a female complement to the lung. In this period, the crow becomes the recognized sun symbol. Perhaps the Shang motif was maintained in the state of Sung, with its Shang-descended rulers, and possibly in the state of Ch'u, which is linked to Shang culture by a number of scholars, and eventually 119 Private communication from David Keightley. 120 Allan (n. 45 above), p. 321. History of Religions 233</page><page sequence="22">Protohistoric Chinese Religion displaced the Chou sun-cock motif as the various cultural traditions merged. In any case, the crow displaced the solar aspect of thefeng, freeing the image to take on the missing and increasingly important female power symbolic complex. However, the time span involved, over half a millennium, does not lead to any degree of certitude in these regards. The elephant-bird motif remains an enigma to me. The physical inter- pretation of the design motif I consider certain, and such a concept is attested to in Chinese legends. In general, it would seem that the design is an amalgamation of the masculine fertility bull/bison/elephant symbolic complex with the masculine solar/celestial feng symbol of early Chou culture. It is plausible that the motif developed in a different location than thefeng or was that of a subbranch of the Chou Chi clan. However, at this time, archaeological data and inscriptional analysis are inconclusive. Future finds may clarify the situation. The change in ritual decor from the Shang to Chou period may indicate more than a relatively simple change in symbolism. For a long period preceding the present, China has had the presence of both shamans12' and mediums. The distinction is both cultural and psycho- logical: shamans remain, at least partially, in control of their trance relationship with helping spirits; mediums understand themselves to have been taken over by spirits and, at least typically, do not remem- ber their trance experience. Celestial ascent is a common, but not definitive, characteristic of shamanism; in mediumism, it is commonly understood that the spirits descend into the medium.'22 This complex situation could simply be due to the immensity of China and the synthesis of a number of divergent cultures over several thousand years. However, if thefeng does represent the ancestral spirits in their descent to the sacrifice, there is a major conceptual difference from the Shang concept of the t'ao-t'ieh that probably represents the ascent of the sacrifice to Shang ti and the ancestral spirits above.'23 Remnants of shamanistic experiences and concepts continued in late Chou culture (fourth century B.C.E.), especially in the Chuang-tzu and the Ch'u tZU,124 but there are also hints of mediums in the late Chou texts as well. 121 I use the term here in the sense of historians of religions (e.g., Eliade and Hultkrantz) rather than in the more general use of sinologists. 122 It is to be noted that the difference may no longer be a viable one in East Asia following at least two thousand years of synthesis. Carmen Blacker argues that in Japan shamans must be able to function in both modes (The Catalpa Bow [London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1975], pp. 21-30). I am presently attempting to resolve the psychological significance of the difference by interviewing shaman/mediums in Taiwan. 123 Paper (n. I above), figs. 4, 5, 6. 124 This has been discussed by a number of scholars, including Arthur Waley, Edward Schafer, and Wolfgang Bauer.

If male, they are called hsi; if female, they are called wu. They regulate the positions and hierarchy of the spirits (at ceremonies) and see to the sacrificial vessels."125 The character translated as "descend" is the same as the one in ode no. 235, verse 1. Hsi and wu are usually translated as "shamans," and Ch'u is considered the Chinese culture most involved with shamanism. However, it may be that both shamans and mediums were part of early Chinese culture and that hsien refers to shamans and hsi and wu to mediums. Perhaps Shang culture was shamanistic and predynastic Chou culture mediumistic, the two orientations merg- ing after the first century of Chou rule. This, of course, is speculative, but it indicates a direction for potential research. These various hypotheses raise another interesting issue. All the Chou symbols appear uniform in having a southern locus, in distinc- tion to those of the Shang. Shamanism is a Siberian and circumpolar phenomenon; mediumism is common to Southeast Asia and Oceania. Crow is a northern circumpacific sun symbol; sun cock is Southeast Asian and Oceanian. Hsiang (elephant) has a southern Chinese locus. The Chou homeland was in the Wei valley, southwest of the last Shang capital, but, according to their traditions, they had only moved there within the century before the conquest of Anyang. There are hints in the Shih-chi (the second-century B.C.E. history) that the Chou were "barbarians" before they moved into the Wei valley: that is, they had customs different from those of the Shang. It is possible that their ultimate origin was further south, perhaps linked to the still undetermined source of wet-rice agriculture.
