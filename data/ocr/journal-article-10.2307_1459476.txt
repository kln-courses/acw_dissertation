<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sex and Love in the Bible. By WILLIAM GRAHAM COLE. New York: Association Press, 1959. xvi + 448 pages. $6.50. The literature on Sex and Love is so numerous that it would be impossible for even the specialists to keep abreast with recent publications. Everyone who thinks he</page><page sequence="2">380 BOOK REVIEWS has something to say on the problem of Sex and Love writes a book, or makes pro- nouncements. The Lambeth Conference of Anglican Bishops, which met in 1958, issued a report on "The Family in Contemporary Society." The- World Council of Churches and the International Missionary Council called an international consultative confer- ence on the population explosion and respon- sible parenthood. Then we have the Kinsey reports. Hollywood is making full use (or abuse) of Sex. The author of the book un- der review thought that it would be a good idea to present the biblical aspect on this important subject. The book consists of twelve chapters. These chapters are replete with facts about the attitudes and practices of the ancient world, with special consideration of the Hebrew-Christian point of view. The first two chapters deal with divine and human love in the Old Testament. The author ad- duces many examples to show that the He- brew word for love, aheb, is used to de- scribe both human and divine love. Since the Hebrew was not fettered by abstract ideas, he employed anthropomorphic lan- guage, but without confusing the divine with the human. He used it analogously. There are numerous examples to show that ro- mantic love among the Hebrews was not an unknown quantity. The story of Jacob, who was willing to work fourteen years in order to get the girl of his heart, David and Bathsheba, etc., the Song of Songs, are classical examples of romantic love. Chapters three and four deal with divine and human love in the New Testament. Here divine love is conceived of as disinterested love--agape rather than either eros or philia. This love is peculiar to God alone. It is spontaneous love. It goes out to everyone, since it is its very nature to love. Man, as conceived in the New Testament, cannot by nature love either God or his neighbour. Only agape-love, coming to man as God's gracious gift, enables him to love both ver- tically and horizontally, i.e. God and man. Here stress is laid on man's love for God and neighbour as being primarily a response to the divine love awakened by God's activity in Christ. In other words, love in the New Testament is theocentric and Christocentric rather than anthropocentric. This kind of love does not seek to gratify one's sensual desires. Love that is not centred in God results in various sorts of idolatry. For in- stance, the rich man cannot enter into the Kingdom of God not because he is rich, but because the object of his love is not God, nor his neighbour, but his wealth. The Jew may be enamored of the Law, or his own righteousness, the Greek of his wisdom- all these signs of misplaced and misdirected love. The root of present-day trouble in marital and family relationships is the com- plete misunderstanding of the nature and function of love. The kind of love presented in the New Testament has the peculiar property of increasing when extended to others. This view of love changes all our re- lationships to wife, to husband, to children, to friends, to God. The other chapters deal with sex attitudes and practices around the Fertile Crescent, and the Graeco-Roman world. Some of the attitudes and practices are treated quite ex- haustively, others are treated more briefly. The sexual aberrations treated in this vol- ume would make the Kinsey reports look very respectable by comparison. While the title may strike some readers to be sensa- tional, the subject matter is treated with ut- most seriousness and sympathy. This book should be of tremendous help to ministers, social workers, and others who are concerned with the serious problems presented by Sex and Love in our society. The author and publishers are to be commended highly for making this volume available to the reading public. Louis J. SHEIN McMaster University</page></plain_text>
