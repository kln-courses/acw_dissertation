<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Revised Pages Chapter 4 Killer Plants of the  Late Nineteenth Century Elizabeth Chang ••• How might a fictional plant consume a fictional person in the nine- teenth century? An unwary traveler could stumble against a trunk ooz- ing poisonous sap while exploring a British tropical colony. A collector  of exotic plants might be ensnared in his London conservatory by a  choice new acquisition. And there remained always the possibility that  Martian attackers could introduce carnivorous tendrils while carrying  out an invasion of earth. Such attacks appeared in all kinds of Victorian  fiction resistant to realism, including the popular subgenres of scientific  romance, gothic horror, and colonial adventure. The obvious follow-u p  question—w hy might a fictional plant consume a fictional person in the  nineteenth century?— has a more complicated answer. While the urgen- cy of the plant’s appetite matches the threatening taste for British flesh  displayed by other monsters of the era, whether inanimate, animate, or  reanimated, the idea that a plant could pursue an appetite at all defied  distinctions between forms of organic life. As Henry Mayhew establishes  in the final volume of London Labour and the London Poor (1862), “The  essential quality of an animal is that it seeks its own living, whereas a  vegetable has its living brought to it.”1 Fiction investigating the possi- bility of vegetables seeking their own living—a ppearing in novels, short  stories, and “traveller’s tales” for general audiences and avid botanists  81 </page> <page sequence="2"> Revised Pages 82  •   strange science alike— therefore explored several horrors at once: first, that the expand- ing nineteenth- century British natural world opened up new and unex- pected plant dangers, second, a plant could be intentionally dangerous,  and third, that a plant could have any kind of intentions at all.2 This essay, then, is one small piece of the much larger story of  nineteenth- century British literature’s changing engagement with the  natural world. In ways that many critics have noted, the Victorian era’s  realist authors, evolutionary thinkers, natural theologians, photogra- phers, children’s fabulists, botanical illustrators, sensation novelists,  among many more, all found particular and signature ways to write  about natural conditions both well known and newly known. Further,  the new varieties of prose fiction and nonfiction that these writers and  artists produced drew from each other in complex ways across gener- ic divisions. Darwin and the novelists conversed through both form  and content, explorers from Mungo Park to Francis Younghusband  gave inspiration to authors of adventure tales, and, closer to home,  “the eminence of the detail” linked older but persistent practices of  natural description to the minutiae-l aden plots of provincial novels, as  Amy King has shown.3 In many ways, then, literature of the Victorian  era, from science writing to realist fiction, depended on key aspects  of narrative—i ncluding characterization, setting, and descriptive and  figurative language— to effect an important development. Readers of  nineteenth-c entury fiction came to understand the natural world itself  as a narrative, which could be comprehended and explained especially  well using the elements of narrative. Fringe fiction, of course, took this understanding to its extreme.  Unhitched from conventions of realist representation, antimimetic fic- tion of the late nineteenth century used familiar narrative techniques  to tell new stories of worlds much like the Victorian reader’s own, with  certain striking exceptions— the existence of vampires, perhaps, or  the invention of time machines. These works sought to invoke a world  beyond the constraints of natural laws, while always emphasizing an inev- itable return to the world that those laws actually governed. Journeys  to the center of the earth, to the jungles of South America, or to the  depraved corners of London’s East End all began with an affirmation  of the scientific principles and rhetoric that the fiction would then fan- tastically invert and rearrange. Yet however far- ranging these narratives  became, they shared a foundational premise with the more serious writ- ing of the era described above: that the natural world could not always be  comprehended in its individuality or its variety using old methods, and  </page> <page sequence="3"> Revised Pages Killer Plants of the Late Nineteenth Century  •   83 instead required new narrative techniques to delineate its bounds. This  is especially true, I contend, when we look closely at pseudoscientific  stories of carnivorous plants. While the relations between human and  animal monsters has been of critical interest for some time, only recently  have notions of plant sentience and intentionality directed literary or  philosophical investigations.4 These unusual narratives are worth looking at further, however,  because they compel us to ask questions about what plants can do. Sto- ries of strange plants with anthropomorphic qualities borrowed rhe- torical conventions from science writing to explain how their vegetable  protagonists evolved over time and acclimatized across space. But they  also boldly rewrote scientific conventions to allow a tree the carnivo- rous impulses of a basilisk or the higher intelligence of man himself. In  this chapter, I will examine genre fiction of the late nineteenth century  inspired by (though hardly faithful to) the conventions of serious scien- tific writing in order to follow the Victorians’ developing argument for  the existence of a plant-b ased consciousness— or more precisely, an idea  of consciousness that does not explicitly exclude the possibility of plants.  The challenges in such presuppositions of nonexclusion are multiple.  For one, writers of fiction about conscious plants had to explain how  such consciousness could be determined in the first place. For another,  these fictions had also to acknowledge the variables of scale and col- lectivity when aligning consciousness with different kinds of plant life—  fungi, forests, parasitic vines— that did not match anthropomorphic def- initions of individual identity. In describing the activities of “man-e ating  trees,” “strange orchids,” and “plants that fight,” this fiction used these  problematic cultivars and their aggression against human characters to  expand beyond the limits of realism. Plants, particularly because of their  seeming resistance to fictional modes, literally ground fiction in organic  experience, making their presence in realist fiction necessary to affirm  diegetic bona fides. And yet to admit plants as narrative elements with  any degree of agency is to defy the standard parameters by which we  understand narrative fiction to operate. A plant with narrative agency  radically alters notions about sentience, mobility, reproduction, and  representation— not the least by blurring distinctions between character  and setting. Thus all kinds of plants that appear in fiction can work as thought  experiments; evidence of environmental and aesthetic conditions that  ensure that conditions within the narrative either do or do not cohere  with the reader’s own organic surroundings. The carnivorous plant takes  </page> <page sequence="4"> Revised Pages 84  •   strange science this experiment further. When found in British fiction set abroad, the  malevolent vegetable proposes a distributed consciousness that contra- venes established relations between subject and background, but also  makes it more possible to understand a hostile colonial environment  as deliberately resistant and in need of broadly intrusive management  or even destruction. When entering the domestic British sphere— as  a commodity, treasure, stowaway, or weapon—t he threatening plant’s  violent subversion of the imposed relationship between cultivated and  cultivator not only disrupts carefully wrought alliances between humans  and plants, but also suggests a disruption or revision to the notion of  cultivation itself as a temporally and materially discrete process— plants  may do their own cultivating, against and apart from human purpose, in  a manner that both builds on and reframes better-u nderstood linkages  between female cultivation and horticultural work.5 Whereas late-c entury interest in plants has been less attended to—  with Darwin’s botanical writings, for example, overshadowed by his  work on evolutionary theory— the Victorian discussion of plants in all  their forms was vigorous, varied, and conceptually distinct from its pre- decessors, as this chapter will suggest. In particular, Victorian carnivo- rous plant fictions used popular narrative forms—t he adventure novel,  the mystery, the gothic horror text—t o describe this new set of relation- ships between plants and the humans who grew them, consumed them,  lived with them, and thought through them. This change was both  responsive to and supportive of corresponding shifts in horticulture,  botany, garden and landscape design, environmental science, natural  history, and ecological consciousness taking place in the world beyond  the page, which make the surrounding context for the specific changes  discussed in this chapter. Despite being only a slight piece of this larger context, man- eating  plant fiction has important implications for the narrative possibilities  open to a late- Victorian reading public poised on the edge of radi- cal changes in both literary and environmental history. These changes  cannot be separated from the high-w ater mark of imperial expansion  also achieved at this time, nor from the colonial metropole’s engage- ments with the environments of distant territories within and without  the empire proper. Indeed, as multiple historians have pointed out,  the expansion of the British empire was inextricably combined with  environmental change, and the final years of the nineteenth century  marked the strongest alignment yet between imperial expansion and  ecological alteration.6 In addition to the primary critical paradigms  </page> <page sequence="5"> Revised Pages Killer Plants of the Late Nineteenth Century  •   85 shaping our reading of fin de siècle literature— of the imperial gothic,  of degeneration, of professionalism, of catastrophe— we can add the  fictional accommodation of varieties of nonnative biological, and par- ticularly botanical, life.7 Thus it is clear that plants helped late Victorian readers think about  themselves and their world, in all its political, economic, and scientific  expanses. Certainly Victorian empire extended itself along botanical  lines in multiple ways, and in all cases, plants were increasingly under- stood as mobile, malleable agents of empire that enacted significant revi- sions in the landscape even as human activities significantly revised plant  specimens and communities as well.8 This apparently newfound plant  mobility drives one interpretation of fictions about carnivorous plants:  that they are allegories of the bad effects of British colonial rapaciousness  in which the landscape, for once, can actually fight back against resource  extraction and exploitation. However, as critics of the teleological his- tory of plant exchanges have pointed out, environments have long been  reshaped by exchanges taking place apart from the European botanical  venture, so perhaps the rapacious colonizer is in this case as interested  in justifying his own influence as he is in demonizing the native flora.9 So in addition to these stagings and restagings of the colonial  encounter, we can also consider man-e ating plant fictions as narra- tive recountings of a profound ontological inquiry. The killer plants  in these stories represent threatening advancements in the ability of  plants to connect with humans in a roughly equivalent way; something  Robert Mitchell has termed in Romantic literature “cryptogamia” or  “seduction of the human by  .  .  . the strange and dark life of vegeta- tion.”10 As opposed to conservationist impulses that have characterized  many ecocritical readings of nineteenth- century literature, Mitchell  suggests that such cryptogamia is at heart a new and transformative  impulse— describing an interspecies love affair unachievable without  permanent alteration on both sides.11 Jumping ahead to the close of  the nineteenth century, when Victorian botanical fictions told dark- er tales than Wordsworth’s daffodils or Shelley’s sensitive plants, we  find that the alien nature of the plant continues to challenge the gap  between vegetable and human through narrative. In the remainder of this chapter, I will review the ways that plants  were grudgingly awarded agency in Victorian fiction, not by virtue of  their perceived suffering, but instead through fantasies of the suffering  they could inflict. Scientific writing on insectivorous plants and crypto- gamic fungi advanced in parallel with fictions of man- eating trees and  </page> <page sequence="6"> Revised Pages 86  •   strange science alien red weeds, with both allowing, to greater and lesser degree, the  derived intentionality of the vegetable kingdom to serve as evidence of  an active and directive consciousness available somehow, though in ways  not necessarily evident to humans. The search for this evidence ranges  through standard colonial adventures like Frank Aubrey’s The Devil Tree  of El Dorado (1897) and later results in the most challenging and interest- ing fiction of this kind, produced by William Hope Hodgson, Algernon  Blackwood, and H. G. Wells. Critical readings of these stories, I propose,  can also shift the way we consider other genre authors of the end of  the century, whether H. Rider Haggard or Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert  Louis Stevenson or Bram Stoker, or even modernist forerunners Rud- yard Kipling or Joseph Conrad. For all of these authors, and for count- less others who also contributed works of antirealist romance, the major  problem of fiction was how to perceive and understand the nature of  another, particularly when that other may be self- replicating, divided,  multiple, obscured, invisible, or otherwise fractured and dispersed. At  the edge of modernism, fiction sought new ways to apprehend and  explain the operations of an external subjectivity. Thinking about the  possible thoughts of plants helped such writers work through difficul- ties of obscure and fractured consciousness by demonstrating just how  obscure and how fractured such external subjectivities could be. Killer  plant fictions depended on a concern (however sensationalized) for dis- cernable traces of subjectivity across the foreign and colonized worlds  and beyond the bounds of the human or animal body. To not consider  the specific influence of the vegetable world in the rising genre of anti- realist fiction is to ignore a significant piece of that genre’s foundation.  It is also to set aside the relevance of late- century attention to plants and  plant communities as a serious concern for both art, science, and the  nascent interdisciplinary field of ecology. That the first fifty years of the nineteenth century entirely reshaped  the ordinary Briton’s understanding of global plant life is by now a criti- cal commonplace. From organizations like the (later Royal) Horticul- tural Society, periodicals like Gardener’s Magazine and Gardener’s Chronicle,  manuals like The Suburban Gardener and Villa Companion (1838), profes- sional horticulturalists like John Lindley, and gardening experts like John  and Jane Loudon and Joseph Paxton, countless amateurs learned to take  seriously the study, collection, and display of plants on a broad scale.12  Despite significant constraints of gender and class, plant appreciation  and cultivation was a matter of widespread general interest and knowl- edge by the later nineteenth century, and authors both high- and low-  </page> <page sequence="7"> Revised Pages Killer Plants of the Late Nineteenth Century  •   87 brow could deploy a range of references to plants foreign and domestic  with the confidence that their readers could follow their nuances. With  greater knowledge of plant names and appearances, references made to  specific plants, as individual specimens, carried an epistemological heft  distinguishing them from a more generally undifferentiated landscape,  background, or setting. Victorian readers were taught by nonfiction and  fiction alike to think seriously about their plants and the possibilities of  their cultivation, in the same way that they might think about children,  pets, or colonized subjects. Of course, these are amplifications rather than inventions. Long  before the publication of Charles Darwin’s works Insectivorous Plants  (1875) and The Power of Movement in Plants (1877), natural theology had  helped readers consider the possibility that the plants they grew might  have abilities or even desires unknown to their cultivator. James Tupper’s  An Essay on the Probability of Sensation in Vegetables (1811) opines that a  benevolent Creator would surely “bestow upon vegetables a capacity to  enjoy their own state of life,”13 while George Towers, writing in the Gar- dener’s Magazine in 1833, suggests only half- facetiously that a “plant is,  bona fide, an organized being, endowed with sensitive life to a greater or  lesser extent.”14 Darwin’s volumes, however, generated controversy for the wholly seri- ous overlap they seemed to imply between the automatic responses of  plants through actions like phototropism and the intentional responses  of a conscious being. This despite Darwin’s defensive claim that his gen- eral use of the term “sensitive” throughout Insectivorous Plants was not  meant to imply consciousness but merely intended to describe the excit- able glands and tentacles of the insectivorous plants he described. As he  explains: “Strictly speaking, the glands ought to be called irritable, as the  term sensitive generally implies consciousness; but no one supposes that  the Sensitive- plant is conscious, and as I have found the term convenient,  I shall use it without scruple.”15 As historians of science have pointed out,  Darwin’s language links him to earlier, discredited experimentation on  photo- and gravitropism and sensitivity in plants that posited that such  reactions established a chain of association between plant and animal  behavior and vitalism.16 Even more troubling to fellow scientists were  the assertions of Darwin’s German follower Ernst Haeckel, who, under  the aegis of scientific monism, concluded that since the movements of  the sensitive plants are “strikingly similar to the movements of the lower  animal forms: whoever ascribes consciousness to the latter cannot refuse  it to such vegetal forms.”17 </page> <page sequence="8"> Revised Pages 88  •   strange science For indeed, despite the scruples of established science, many were  ready to suppose that a plant could be conscious and that conscious- ness and even morality could be implied from plant movement. H. Rider  Haggard, a prolific and enthusiastic gardener and agricultural writer  when not chronicling the adventures of Allan Quartermain (A Farmer’s  Year [1899], Rural England [1902], A Gardener’s Year [1905]), describes  an unusual Sundew specimen in his collection as a “vegetable butcher,”  and continues: To my mind, its unpleasant habits show in a very striking manner  how real, if subtle, is the connection between the animal and the veg- etable world, for here we have a plant actually feeding on the living  creatures that it has caught, and, what is more, baiting its traps in  order to catch them. Is there, then, so wide a gulf between it and homo  sapiens, who does precisely the same thing and lives thereby? We think  nothing of putting this law of death—N ature’s hideous scheme— in  motion for our own profit, but when a wretched little plant imitates  our exalted example, the effect is uncanny.18 The step forward made here from plant sensitivity to plant malevo- lence was long anticipated, as Theresa Kelly has shown in her discussion  of Erasmus Darwin’s consideration of the venomous Upas tree.19 Hag- gard’s move to the propositional sphere (“Is there, then . . .”) may seem  particularly apt for a writer of fantastic fiction, but he was certainly not  the only writer to wonder if the strong distinction between plant “habits”  and human actions might in fact be only a perceptual construct.20 The carnivorous sundew also attracted members of the aesthetic  and decadent movement, a group predisposed to favor unsettling inter- changes between plant and animal life.21 Algernon Swinburne’s poem  “The Sundew” (1862) similarly reflects on the ontological proximity  between humans and plants: “You call it sundew; how it grows / If with  its colour it have breath, / If life taste sweet to it, if death / Pain its  soft petal, no man knows: / Man has no sight or sense that saith” (ll.  26– 30).22 Later, Grant Allen, a science writer of some influence before  his blossoming as an author of detective and New Woman fiction, drew  on both Darwin and Swinburne in calling the plant “atrociously and  deliberately wicked” in his 1884 article “Queer Flowers,” written for the  Cornhill Magazine.23 Allen frames the sundew’s description in a larger  reflection on the horrors of possible plant sentience, writing, “There  is something too awful and appalling in this contest of the unconscious  </page> <page sequence="9"> Revised Pages Killer Plants of the Late Nineteenth Century  •   89 and insentient with the living and feeling, of a lower vegetative form  of life with a higher animated form,” continuing, “There seems to be a  sort of fiendish impersonal cruelty about its action which sadly militates  against all our pretty platitudes about the beauty and perfection of living  beings.”24 Allen’s distress over the sundew inverts customary directions of  sympathy by doubly deploying “murderous propensities.”25 The sundew  itself is actively cruel in seeking out its insect prey, but the sundew’s cru- elty is also metaphorically active, “militating” its way into conventional  discourse and disrupting the familiar systems of figurative language. In  both regards, the sundew, an “inconspicuous small weed” with “literary  and scientific honours  .  .  . heaped upon its head to an extent almost  unknown in the case of any other member of the British floral com- monweal” (404), goes against the standards by which fin de siècle Victo- rian culture has been held to recognize conscious existence: the sundew  impresses not because it suffers itself, but because it causes other to do  so.26 Counterpoised to late-c entury debates over animal welfare, vivisec- tion, and vegetarianism, discussions of plant sentience now gravitated  not to sympathy but to antipathy and fear.27 Even in Samuel Butler’s satire of colonial adventure fiction Erewhon  (1872), plant consciousness is memorably detailed through the “low  cunning” of a potato in a dark cellar. Appearing within its intertext  “Book of the Machines,” the description of the potato’s advances accom- modates both a mockery of the Erewhonian professor of botany’s squea- mish attention to vegetable rights and a surprisingly activist assertion of  plant volition. Of the cunning potato, Butler writes: “He [the potato]  knows perfectly well what he wants and how to get it. He sees the light  coming from the cellar window and sends his shoots crawling straight  thereto . . . we can imagine him saying, ‘I will have a tuber here and a  tuber there, and I will suck whatsoever advantage I can from all my sur- roundings.’ . . . The potato says these things by doing them, which is the  best of languages. What is consciousness if this is not consciousness?”28  Though Butler uses this example largely as an opportunity for comedy at  the expense of the Erewhonians, such satire does not negate his equally  radical expansion of consciousness’s proof-c ase. Nor, despite the obvi- ously false imposition of a personal pronoun and personifying form,  does Butler intend us to not accept the consequences for agency that  the potato’s advancing tubers propose, for such ideas resonate across his  work. Philip Armstrong has pointed out that the language of the Erewho- nian professor of botany is borrowed in part from Butler’s own lecture  “The Subdivision of the Organic World into Animal and Vegetable,” and  </page> <page sequence="10"> Revised Pages 90  •   strange science Gillian Beer has shown that Butler’s “pleasure in imagining the eager- ness of other life forms” is reflected in his nonfiction studies.29 Life and  Habit (1878), for example, proposes that personal identity in humans  rests upon the same self- generating volition that allows “the lichen . . .  [to] grow upon the granite rock by first saying to itself, ‘I think I can do  it.’”30 As Butler investigates, personhood is equally a continuously evolv- ing condition linking one life stage with the next and at the same time a  singular and momentary expression of consciousness; in much the same  way, even as carnivorous plant stories showed the consequences of natu- ral selection advancing at terrible speed toward a horrifying end, they  also illuminated an asynchronous notion of plant intentionality appre- hended only in the moment. This was as true when plant predators were used as a blunt instrument  of horror as much as when they were held to offer a nuanced explora- tion of vegetable consciousness. Low- quality adventure stories, aimed at  readers unaccustomed to considering Allen’s and Butler’s philosophical  and moral concerns, framed the problem of discerning plant intentions  as a matter of self- preservation amid an uncontrolled and fecund envi- ronment. The young Arthur Conan Doyle’s 1879 story “An American’s  Tale,” Phil Robinson’s “The Man- Eating Tree” (1881), Frank Aubrey’s  The Devil Tree of El Dorado (1897), and Fred White’s “Purple Terror”  (1899) all present vicious trees (or, in Doyle’s case, tree- sized murderous  flytraps) in locations both lush and indeterminate. Doyle’s flytraps grow  in a frontier alternately identified as Arizona and Montana where “Grass  as hung over a chap’s head as he rode through it, and trees so thick that  you couldn’t catch a glimpse of blue sky for leagues and leagues, and  orchids like umbrellas!”31 Roraima, the great plateau that conceals both  Aubrey’s devil tree and the long- lived tribe that keeps the tree’s secrets,  contains “flora and fauna [that] flourish unchecked in the utmost luxu- riance of tropical savage life,” where, bafflingly enough to the British  narrator, “one of the greatest marvels and mysteries of the earth lies on  the outskirt of one of our colonies, and we leave the mystery unsolved,  the marvel uncared for.”32 Will Scarlett, the enterprising amateur bota- nist and central character of White’s story, first experiences the “Purple  Terror” in a military expedition across Cuba, where his “geographical  and botanical knowledge were going to prove of considerable service to  a grateful country when said grateful country should have passed beyond  the rudimentary stages of colonization.”33 Cheryl Blake Price has shown  in her work on man- eating trees that these stories reflect both “ecopho- bic reactions to the colonial environment” and “anxiety that the colonial  </page> <page sequence="11"> Revised Pages Killer Plants of the Late Nineteenth Century  •   91 wilderness  .  .  . was disappearing through the mechanisms of colonial- ism,” and there are many further implications for the consideration of  animate organic landscape in these fictions that go beyond my particular  focus on plant consciousness.34 So even as these landscapes are established as visually and horticultur- ally unintelligible or unknown, their organic elements are also constantly  evolving into new forms. Robinson’s narrator, recounting a brush with a  man- eating tree in central Africa, begins not with the exciting plot details  of the attack, but with an extended philosophical reflection on the neces- sary correspondence between plant and animal worlds, concluding: The vegetable world, however, has its revenges. You may keep the  guinea pig in a hutch, but how will you pet the basilisk? The little  sensitive plant in your garden amuses your children . . . but how could  you transplant a vegetable that seizes the running deer, strikes down  the passing bird, and once taking hold of him, sucks the carcass of  man himself, till his matter becomes as vague as his mind, and all his  animate capabilities cannot escape him from the terrible embrace  of— God help him!— an inanimate tree?35 Kelly Hurley, exploring fin de siècle gothic, has proposed that  Aubrey, Doyle, and Robinson are of a piece with William Hope Hodg- son and H. G. Wells in imagining evolutionary monstrosities, animal and  vegetable, that generally attack the priority of the specific human form:  “The viscosity of the predatory natural world may be said to represent  the suchness of matter, as it gains sentience and rises up to swallow the  bounded human world,” she suggests.36 Hurley’s reading is borne out by  Robinson’s insistence that “the sensual instincts of beast and vegetable  are manifestly analogous— the world must be as percipient as sentient  throughout” and, equally, by his claim that “given the necessity of  .  .  .  urgent self-i nterest, every animal or vegetable could eventually revolu- tionize its nature.”37 But Robinson’s identification of the particularly ter- rible revenges of the vegetable world links his evolutionary fantasy not  just to any kind of monster but to monsters emerging from practices of  Victorian plant enthusiasms’ global plant exchange specifically. The fear  is not that the petted plant specimens in the kitchen garden will evolve  into sentience, but that they possess sentience already. Equally, the desires of Will Scarlett, who is lured to the “Purple Ter- ror” both by his lust for new plants and by his lust for a beautiful wom- an, make him vulnerable to attack in ways unique to the horticulturally  </page> <page sequence="12"> Revised Pages 92  •   strange science enraptured Victorian era. When he viewed the flowers of the murderous  parasitical vine, “All Scarlett’s scientific enthusiasm was aroused. It is not  given to every man to present a new orchid to the horticultural world.  And this one would dwarf the finest plant hitherto discovered.”38 While  White’s story only proposes such an exchange— the orchids remain root- ed in their Caribbean setting— it was also a common feature in tales of  murderous plants used to describe the effects of a specimen returned to  a domestic locale. These acts of botanical exchange were not unique to  the era, but the vast increase in the scale of the collections and the reach  of the botanical collectors placed ever greater pressure on narrative and  nomenclature to preserve geographical distinction between native and  nonnative species. As John Rieder points out, such “fantasies of appro- priation,” cloaked as “zoological and ethnological acquisitiveness,” unite  the emerging genre of science fiction with the earlier prose of travel nar- rative under the logic of colonialism; given the overwhelming evidence  of Victorian emotional attachment to their plants, we must also add to  these appropriations the fantasy of botanical acquisition.39 As Lynn Voskuil shows elsewhere in this volume in her reading of H.  G. Wells’s “The Flowering of the Strange Orchid” (1904), such acquisi- tiveness left domestic collectors ripe for dissection by both the horror  storyteller and the satirist. Another, less well-s tudied direction for mod- ernist horror examines what happens to questions of vegetable sentience  and malevolence when the antagonist is not an easily anthropomor- phized tree, but instead a diffuse collection of fungal spores. Examples  of late nineteenth- century fungus horrors include John Uri Lloyd’s Eti- dorhpa (1895) and William Hope Hodgson’s influential 1907 short story  “The Voice in the Night,” first published in the popular and influential  pulp magazine Blue Book. Hodgson, a former member of the merchant  marine whose works of horror were frequently set a sea, tells the story  of an ill- fated pair of lovers who encounter an island where a “vile fun- gus . . . was growing riot. In places it rose into horrible, fantastic mounds,  which seemed almost to quiver, as with a quiet life, when the wind blew  across them. Here and there, it took on the forms of vast fingers, and in  others it just spread out flat and smooth and treacherous . . . [t]he whole  quaking vilely at times.”40 The gradual realization that the fungus is grow- ing unstoppably, not just across the island but through and around their  bodies, is followed by a sudden and insurmountable compulsion to eat  the growth. This desire continues even after encountering “an extraordi- narily shaped mass of fungus . . . swaying uneasily, as though it possessed  life of its own” with “a grotesque resemblance to the figure of a distorted  </page> <page sequence="13"> Revised Pages Killer Plants of the Late Nineteenth Century  •   93 human creature,” which, upon grim consideration, is understood to in  fact be a sailor previously marooned on this same island. In understand- ing and nobly accepting their future fate, the couple’s narration spares  the tale’s shipboard listeners, who already perceive the fiancé of the  pair as no more than a “great, gray nodding sponge.”41 The story’s hor- ror, then, comes not from the fear of dying on the fungus island, but of  continuing to live there— albeit in a greatly transformed fashion. Fanta- sies of unification between plant and human continue to chill precisely  because they place the resulting hybrid at the far outer limits of not only  narrative, but consciousness itself. Hodgson returned to the genre of the malevolent sea-p lant in his  later short story “The Derelict,” but it was “The Voice in the Night” that  proved most influential to later fungal fictions, including Philip M. Fish- er’s “Fungus Isle” (1923). Fungi, and in particular cryptogamic fungi,  had already been a subject of interest and repulsion throughout the sec- ond half of the century, especially because their spore-b ased reproduc- tion resisted so strongly conventional structures of metaphor.42 It seemed  impossible to distinguish parasitic fungi from their hosts, let alone iden- tify the singular personhood of the fungus itself. Yet larger plant forms  could also form a distributed consciousness with expansive and uncer- tain bounds. One of the most effective of all murderous plant fictions,  Algernon Blackwood’s 1907 short story “The Willows,” describes the  near- sacrifice of two travelers on the Danube to an island of psychically  manipulative willows. In the narrator’s horrified realization of the evil  at work, plants are made mobile and humans fixed in place: “Creep- ing with silent feet over the shifting sands, drawing imperceptibly nearer  by soft unhurried movements, the willows had come closer during the  night. . . . There was a suggestion here of personal agency, of deliberate  intention, of aggressive hostility, and it terrified me into a sort of rigidi- ty.”43 The psychological shock of managing a marooning in a place where  the characters face hostile vegetation—“ We touched the frontier of a  region where our presence was resented. . . . We were the first human  influences on this island and we were not wanted. The willows were against  us”— paralyzes the narrator into a helpless inability to save himself from  his fate.44 Though the two protagonists do eventually escape, spared by  the sacrificial murder (apparently by willow) of an anonymous peasant,  the effect of an environment apparently “on the frontier of another  world, an alien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls  of willows,” shows at what cost the human world is defended against a  botanical villainy far more ontologically complex than Aubrey’s devil  </page> <page sequence="14"> Revised Pages 94  •   strange science tree.45 “The Willows,” one of the earliest and most widely read of Black- wood’s stories, clearly illustrates his lifelong interest in spiritual, mysti- cal and psychic extremes, but also obviously depends upon his finely  observed notions of the elements of landscape and plants in particular to  achieve its effective horrors. There is no longer any question that plants  possess both a metaphorical and actual agency; inquiry is instead redi- rected to the inadequacy of metaphor to defend the individual human  psyche against the incursions of the natural world. If Blackwood’s macabre modernism still stands as the best example  of plant malevolence in the twentieth century, H. G. Wells’s The War of  the Worlds remains remarkable for its nineteenth-c entury naturalization  of the most alien of vegetable attackers. Wells does not foreground the  dual nature (animal and vegetable) of the Martian invaders in his novel,  and in fact we do not learn of the “red weed,” the plant that gives Mars  its characteristic color and threatens to choke England in the process of  doing the same, until we are far into Book 2, “The Earth under the Mar- tians.” Even then the narrator’s introduction is presented as an allusion  within a more general discussion of the differences between life on Mars  and terrestrial life. He records: At any rate, the seeds which the Martians (intentionally or acciden- tally) brought with them gave rise in all cases to red-c oloured growths.  Only that known popularly as the Red Weed, however, gained any  footing in competition with terrestrial forms. The Red Creeper was  quite a transitory growth, and few people have seen it growing. For a  time, however, the Red Weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxu- riance. It spread up the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day  of our imprisonment, and its cactus- like branches formed a carmine  fringe to the edges of triangular window. And afterwards I found it  broadcast throughout the country, and especially wherever there was  a stream of water present.46 This passage is notable especially for its dislocations of scale between,  on the one hand, the broad horticulturally omniscient description giv- en of the red weed’s “vigor and luxuriance,” elsewhere called “titanic”  and “gigantic and of unparalleled fecundity,” and, on the other, the  first- person narrator’s limited knowledge about the weed, which initial- ly matches exactly his limited visual perspective, trapped in a bombed  house with a terrified curate and with only that triangular window framed  in red weed to observe the horrifying progress of the Martian invaders.47  </page> <page sequence="15"> Revised Pages Killer Plants of the Late Nineteenth Century  •   95 Similarly, he tethers his account of the weed to the deflating temporal  reversals of the passage, with the offhand use of the word “afterwards”  spoiling prematurely the inevitability of the invasion’s failure. In intro- ducing the weed at this point, the narrator has already cut away from a  vivid description of the arrival of the fifth Martian cylinder to “add in this  place certain further details which, although they were not all evident  to us at the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them  to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures.”48 The narrator’s  reluctance to comply with the rules of his own narrative condition and  tell the story as it occurred here corresponds with novel’s far more mys- terious model of narrative agency: that of the Martians themselves, both  the creatures operating the tripods and the swiftly growing fronds of the  red weed. As the narrator repeatedly reminds us, the British subjects involved  never really know why the Martians come to Earth but must instead end- lessly speculate about what the Martians’ known actions say about their  probable intent. But despite the lack of human understanding of Mar- tian volition, there are multiple intentional actors here. The tripod oper- ators are of course viciously active, but we also see that red weed is itself  exercising a form of mobility that appears to be intentional. This appar- ent intentionality on the part of this invasive plant is, in fact, of critical  importance given the most central concerns of the novel. In War of the  Worlds, this weaker sort of derived intentionality is the only one admis- sible either when thinking about narrative agency or when inferring the  presence of a threatening and otherwise inaccessible alien conscious- ness. The British waterways that carry the red weed and the mechanical  tripods that transport the Martian creatures are both prostheses for the  alien invaders, amplifying and making more legible the movements that  assert directive consciousness. Though the creatures in tripods accept more readily than the red  weed the impositions of anthropomorphism, Wells does not functionally  distinguish between the two. This supports the idea that Wells implicitly  advances throughout his work— that plants in general, and this plant in  particular, represent an outer limit to the range of human interest in  the alien.49 Indeed, the distinction between the two kinds of Martians  is largely irrelevant: the young Martians “bud off” their parents, like  “young lilybulbs” or “young animals in the fresh- water polyp”; the older  Martians, lacking entrails (or any organs besides brains and hands) are,  plantlike, sustained by fresh blood obtained “directly by means of a little  pipette into the recipient canal,” and, in short, act very much like a super- </page> <page sequence="16"> Revised Pages 96  •   strange science intelligent version of the red weed itself.50 That Wells is, throughout his  fiction, concerned with the distinctions between jungles and gardens is  of a piece with his particular interest in weeds— the alien of plants, and  the best example of the alien nature of plants. This is, of course, because  “weed” is exclusively a derived and relative term— it carries meaning only  in relation to some other class of things that are not weeds— and so to  recognize a weed is to recognize an arbitrary distinction of purpose that  the weed by its lively vigor aims to resist. That the novel uses the Martians to critique, via reverse colonization,  the follies of British imperialism is, of course, a touchstone of its recep- tion and its era, as Stephen Arata and others have shown.51 And clearly  the novel can and should be read, in part, as an account of a galactic  version of an acclimatization society that has gone terribly wrong.52 It  also serves as an example of global circulation that divorces the native  and natural and deprives the horticultural specimen of its proper local  environment. As this novel seeks to demonstrate, even plants that do not  survive by attacking unwitting travelers have intentions that the observer  cannot register except by effect, and even then only if that effect hap- pens to be that of causing grievous harm. Human hands— implied con- stants in the actions of broadcasting, acclimatizing, and transplanting—  falsely imply human agency in the development of global environments,  but Wells means to pick apart the mental constructs that support that  false narrative of exclusively human influence on the surrounding world.  At the dawn of what we now call the environmental movement, this novel  offers the idea of the functionally sentient plant as an example of the  way in which environments and plants can, in fact, broadcast themselves,  through a directive consciousness that can both be understood to exist  and yet be defiantly and totally inaccessible to our figures and narra- tive forms. When Wells’s narrator recounts a walk through the ruined  landscape as “all about me the red weed clambered among the ruins,  writhing to get above me in the dimness,” his insistently foregrounded  imposition of intent onto the plant hints at the countless other imposi- tions and violent figurative replacements that British fictions have done  to their fictional vegetable worlds.53 Adela Pinch has recently pointed out, in her study of the priority of  other people’s thoughts to readers and writers of the nineteenth cen- tury, that “we have grown accustomed to thinking of Victorian Britain  as a realm of science, but it was also a realm of metaphysical specula- tion.”54 When thinking about the thoughts of plants, Victorian writers  and readers found a double redirection: in one sense, plants grew narra- </page> <page sequence="17"> Revised Pages Killer Plants of the Late Nineteenth Century  •   97 tively more vigorous as they gained agency and direction commensurate  with animals and even monstrous or villainous humans, while in another  sense, plants grew inaccessible to narrative and rhetorical figures as they  became weighted with specific and situated forms of geographical and  scientific knowledge. Environmental dramas restaging the natural world,  like these strange science fictions of malevolent plants, show just some of  the many paths to modernism’s challenge of the clean narrative distinc- tion between self and other. But they also suggest ecological fiction’s per- sistent challenge: to imagine how the organic world imagines the human  is also to confront the limits of the possibilities of imagination. Notes  1.
