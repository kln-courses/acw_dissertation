<plain_text><page sequence="1">books THE ARTS OF ZAIRE Volume I: Southwestern Zaire Daniel Biebuyck University of California Press, Berkeley, 1986. xii + 313 pp., 100 blw photos, bibliography, index. $49.50 cloth. This is the first volume in a series that when complete will be a monumental achievement, a massive tidying-up of an extraordinarily in- teresting but thoroughly confusing field. This initial book deals with the arts of Southwest- ern Zaire, from which, however, the Kongo and Teke are excluded - not because they do not fit in, historically and stylistically, but be- cause both the artworks and the literature about them are so extensive as to require a separate volume. The work includes, besides sections on subregions of the Southwest, a number of chapters introductory to the series as a whole. The sources of confusion are both African and European. The literature generated by collectors and critics is written in at least seven European languages. The objects they refer to are scattered in museums on several conti- nents, ambiguously labeled, and (as often as not) stored in crates. The objects derive from communities, now contained within the boundaries of the Republic of Zaire, to which hundreds of names have been variously and problematically attached and whose institu- tions, perhaps now extinct, may be poorly understood. Biebuyck's massive labors bring some order to all this, and provide us with a handbook that should become a standard work of reference for everybody interested in African art. Part 1 summarizes the ethnographic studies that have been done in Zaire, gives the history of the study and classification of Zairian art, and comments on methods of interpretation. This review of the documents is done very po- litely Not merely a division of labor but an explicit antagonism has long prevailed be- tween anthropologists and art critics. "Form, style and aesthetic appreciation have been fa- vored at the expense of so-called ethno- graphic explanations of the cultural framework within which the art operates" (p.40). The critics' insistence that because an artwork speaks aesthetically to the viewer its cultural framework is an unnecessary distrac- tion has served to excuse a good deal of thoroughly unscholarly practice; as Biebuyck discreetly documents, the ethnographic framework does, as it must, enter into critical comment, though often in corrupt form. "It is one thing to note that a figurine is an- thropomorphic and that it has female genitalia and a distended belly, but it is some- thing else to say that the same figurine repre- sents a pregnant woman or a fertility image. Although the two judgments may indeed be connected, they are on different levels of analysis and should not be confused" (p.41). Frobenius's approach is characterized as "a strange blend of carelessness and superficial- ity" (p.7). On Maes's fourfold classification of Kongo fetishes into nkonde, mpezo, namoganga, and mbula, Biebuyck remarks, "This group- ing, though widely followed by later writers, is uncritically based on a tenuous mixture of external characteristics and functional attri- butes of sculptures." He might have added that it makes neither linguistic nor ethno- graphic sense. "All too frequently, cultural in- formation about artworks was restricted to short stereotyped and endlessly repetitious statements" (p.28). The worst confusion has developed around the identifying "ethnic" labels attached to artworks by collectors and critics. Early travelers, forgetting the place of origin of a piece, often improvised one (p.22). Art com- mentaries filled up with a "bizarre mixture of tribal and regional identifications" (p.24). It is difficult to know how to handle the resulting situation, since labels, no matter how bizarre, have become part of the vocabulary of the connoisseur; it is impossible simply to begin afresh. Moreover, "all attempts at cultural classification are doomed to some extent by the necessary generalizations and simplifica- tions. ... the map of cultural distribution has been profoundly affected by common origins of groups, local migration, diversification and specialization, political fragmentation and internal scission, incorporation and assimila- tion, acquisition of land through pacts and purchase, and intensive contacts among heterogeneous units" (p.57). Biebuyck's sen- sible solution is to group all the various labels into the Kongo group, the Teke group, "the peoples of the lower Kasai region and the southern art of Lake Maindombe," and the peoples of the Kwango-Kwilu region. The book deals with the art of the last two, divided into subgroups. It is regrettable that no map is provided. Nevertheless, in his specific commentaries Biebuyck concedes too much to an outmoded cultural historiography in which, once upon a time, the continent was supposedly divided, as by a cookie cutter, into discrete tribes, each with its name, distinctive culture and art style, which then, while retaining in some es- sential way their aboriginal character, mig- rated all over the map to produce the present confusion, a "historical layering" of cultures. This is certainly the dominant perspective of the literature on Zaire, but it deserves chal- lenge. Biebuyck says, "The maps drawn for southwestern Zaire by Boone amply testify to the incredible intermingling of groups" (p.58). So they may, but the accompanying texts testify still more strongly to the un- purged "historical layering" of amateur com- mentary, in which purported ethnic labels and allegations about migration are casually re- produced from existing literature, and new ones just as casually added. On the ground, the situation is often a good deal less layered. Part 2 summarizes the ethnographic picture of the region as a whole: marriage rules, the widespread occurrence of lineages identified as "children" and "slaves" attached to a "fa- Karl Ferdinand Schaedler Keramik ars Schwarz.Afrika mud Altamerika Ceramics from Blaock Africa and Ancient America Cramineue de I'Afrique noire et Pre- columbienne aus der Sammlong from the collection de la collection Hans Wolf Ziirich Edition primart Zerich 0*m, a r0 A Edto a Dfm * D Dh 21 20 paes clore 80 ul Pge fomt 2c cloth cove and by your booksellers 10</page><page sequence="2">ther" village, initiation rites for men and women, the "overwhelming social and reli- gious importance" of the nganga, the place of divination, ancestor cults, and nkisi "power objects." House types, musical instruments, body decoration, insignia, and weapons are mentioned, with references to appropriate surveys. In his overview of the artworks themselves (Part 3), Biebuyck is once again conservative, comprehensive, and sensible. The pioneer- ing, unsystematic but useful classificatory scheme developed by Olbrechts in the 1930s is capable of refinement and remains basic to later ones, including Biebuyck's. Biebuyck is critical of the tendency toward excessive sub- division, with attendant reification of "style groups," evident in the work of Maesen and Cornet. Arguing that the cultural contexts of artworks are better defined than "styles," he lists first (p.90) the institutional contexts for the use of art in the region and the types of artworks themselves: anthropomorphic figurines, zoomorphic figurines, musical in- struments, staffs, spears, pipes, neckrests, pots, and so on. He attempts no definition of what is to be considered "art." On the whole, his list favors the usual European taste for the figurative, but his discussions fully allow for the fact that the same impulse and symbolic intent that produce an "artwork" in one in- stance may produce, in another, an object not recognized as "art." The remainder of the book is devoted to subregional reviews of artworks and styles in cultural context, with ethnic labels (Sakata, Dzing, Yaka, Pende, etc.) subordinated to a geographical classification. These discussions are keyed to 100 plates, of the useful rather than the coffee-table type, showing both familiar and unfamiliar pieces. The text is re- plete with thoughtful and critical commen- tary, making the most of a highly fragmented and imperfect documentation; its com- prehensive scope does not detract from its readability. Even those whose primary con- cern is not art will value these cultural sum- maries as a basis for further work. The bibliog- raphy is very long and exceedingly useful. The next four volumes will deal with the east- ern, lower, southeastern, and northern and central regions of Zaire. Wyatt MacGaffey Haverford College</page></plain_text>
