ALEXANDER Southern Illinois University Carbondale Human personality itself is the essential ground of any reality that we men can know. ?God and Mans Destiny it will be the aim of this article to present the central ideas of the philoso phy of Hartley Burr Alexander. This is not an easy task because his thought directly engages what might be called the significance of mythic consciousness and meaning. And for a philosopher to do this implicitly runs against one of the fundamental stories Western philosophy tells itself to understand what it is, which is that philosophy itself is reason divorced from myth and from its natural form of expression, poetry. In other words, this is the "myth" (or "mythos") of Western philosophy?that it is a rejection of myth! This bears some thought before proceeding to Hartley Alexander's philosophy. When Greek philosophy began with the Milesians, it nowhere made use of the old gods in its effort to explain the nature of the universe.1 And hence the story Western philosophy tells to itself: it originates in the liberation of reason from superstition. This story gets told again and again; with Socrates, as dramatized by Plato, it gets a mythic martyr who becomes the archetype for Western philosophers: dismissive of the past or the opinions of the many, subjecting everything to the examination of Logos. Philosophy did not take such a development in India or China. If early Greek thought asked out of pure curiosity "What is the nature of the cosmos?" then in India the question was "How may one attain liberation?" and in China "How may the state at tain harmony with The Way?" The former sought rapprochement with the old Vedic gods and rituals so that the Upanishads, so critical of Brahmanical ritualism, became "the end of the Vedas," and the other venerated the past and ceremonialized tradition. Perhaps we should step back and hold off the Western assumption that philosophy and myth (and poetry) are necessarily exclusive of each other. It was Alexander's view that they were not. the pluralist Volume 3, Number 1 Spring 2008 : pp. 89-127 ?2008 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois 89</page><page sequence="2">90 THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 Hartley Alexander had grown up enchanted by the world of Native Ameri can culture and deeply concerned with the disrespect in which it was held in the late nineteenth century as well as its pervasive erosion and mutilation by Ameri can civilization.2 He also had the soul of a poet. His fundamental sympathies were with mythos, however much veneration logos was legitimately due. One dominant reason for this, aside from temperament, was that modern Western civilization, governed by a materialism in both metaphysics and ethics, was alienating its inhabitants from the best and deepest aspects of human nature. In its quest for the "mastery of nature" (as Descartes called it), it was making it harder to live a fully human life. Existence concerns more than power and its mastery through technology for the satisfaction of desires. The beginning point, the arche, for philosophy in Alexander s view had to be an understanding of human nature in all its dimensions. Philosophical anthropology, not "episte mologa" was the way to proceed, for human nature was revealed through all its expressions, but most of all through those symbols that were embodied in the arts and religion. Whatever the ultimate nature of reality "in itself" might be, Alexander was convinced that the ultimate meaning it would have for us would have to be set forth in those symbols whereby we became intelligible to ourselves. The key was knowing that they were symboh and that the symbolism was rooted in the very nature of our embodied, living existence. Thus Alexander advocated a position that was focused on the primacy of personhood, the ultimate grounding of reason on symbol, the radical limita tion of any metaphysics as a human symbolization of the world (preserving its presence for us beyond the human as mystery), the inherent and irreducible pluralism of our articulations of its meaning, and, finally, the humanistic mis sion of philosophy as a "house of mind," that is, as a bearer and interpreter of world cultures as homes of the human spirit. He had no particular name, no "-ism," for his thought, though of course the "naturalists" could only see it as some form of "idealism." I suggest "humanistic personalism" would be less misleading. Insofar as he sympathized with Bergson's insistence that time is the proper way to approach all things, and in his description of "drama" as the basic human form of time?the "cosmic category"?he should also be thought of in terms of being a "process philosopher." One final difficulty remains in giving an exposition of his thought. As might be inferred already, Alexander did not aim at any sort of formal system atizing, though an integrated position was, I believe, successfully put forth. Philosophy for him was no impersonal "ego cogito" setting forth abstractions, but rather a personal utterance to his fellow human beings, as much an appeal to our own sense of humanity as an argument made to reason. Unfortunately,</page><page sequence="3">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 91 as the winds of doctrine in early twentieth century Anglo-American philoso phy blew ever more toward logical empiricism and "naturalism," Alexander's own voice sounded more and more archaic?almost willfully so, as I suspect was the case. In setting forth his main ideas, I will proceed from his early critique of rationalism found in The Problem of Metaphysics and the Meaning of Meta physical Explanation (1902) to his more developed ontology of the person as individual in Poetry and the Individual (1906) and related contemporaneous essays. I will then examine his central theory of "Vital Symbolism" along with his humanistic metaphysical position set forth in God and Mans Destiny (1936). His broad outline for a methodological approach (we would say a "hermeneutics") to the philosophy of civilization, the previously unpublished manuscript of Living Mind, will show his personalism as taken as a "house of mind," which culture provides. I shall conclude with brief examinations of his applications of his position to Christianity and Native American religions as set forth in Truth and the Faith (1929) and The World's Rim (1953). Toward a Humanistic Metaphysics: The Origin of the Question of Existence Alexander's first book, The Problem of Metaphysics and the Meaning of Meta physical Explanation: An Essay in Definitions, already presents a basis for a personalistic, pluralistic philosophy. It had begun as a dissertation on Bradley, and in its substantially recast form still retained criticisms of Bradley (and other noted absolute idealists).3 Its main purpose, however, was constructive: a defense of the human standpoint in metaphysical meaning, one that rejected both material reductionism and rationalistic absolutism. The work under takes to examine the meaning of certain key metaphysical terms?identity, causality, and the principle of sufficient reason?for "most of our differences in matters metaphysical are misunderstandings." But certain convictions of the author are stated outright: First, there is a conviction that metaphysic [sic] is not a science of things ultimate in the cosmos, but of things ultimate in human life and destiny and ultimate only for human insight; that consequently, metaphysical solutions must change as the human outlook changes, and that the way of our thought must develop as our powers of intuition become enlarged. No final metaphysical solution is possible, because so long as human intelligence broadens metaphysical truth must alter. It is not independent nor static, but exists for knowledge alone. That there is</page><page sequence="4">92 THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 need to-day of a new metaphysic, a new vision of man s destiny. . . this, too, is a conviction underlying these writings. (6) This was to remain a central tenet of Alexander s thought throughout his life. It may be true, as Aristotle said, that it is natural for human beings to seek knowledge, but there are different types of knowledge interests involved. There is the interest in the sort of knowledge that aids in controlling nature and that leads to technology. Ordinary curiosity about the world leads, eventu ally, to those interests that define scientific knowledge, and scientific concerns themselves give rise to the more general speculative questions of metaphysics. But there is besides these "a lively and personal concern for knowledge that may serve human welfare and reveal human destiny," which "springs from a deep unrest that forgets the immediate, and will only content itself with reading the riddles of fate, it becomes, in a larger sense, a human interest"; it "demands the meaning of Nature for man"; it is "an anxious interest, with desires and aspirations for which it hopes to find a reason and satisfaction in the nature of things" (Problem of Metaphysics 9-10, emphasis added). This leads to a different type of metaphysics than that arising purely from disin terested curiosity, Aristotle's "desire to know." It has a different "mood" than that found in speculative curiosity or the desire to control nature, one we would more likely characterize today as existential.4 While this interest does not preempt the authority of the intellect, it does determine what problems will be of greatest concern?and it will insist on asking questions that may not ultimately be capable of final resolution, exact rational formulation or technical control. Even so, Alexander asserts, they are not therefore idle or meaningless. But what might count as a legitimate satisfaction of this existential or human metaphysical interest? As William James pointed out in "The Senti ment of Rationality," whatever else a rational explanation may be, it is also a certain type offeeling of continuity (Will to Believe 63-64, 78-79). The hu man interest is aware of its motives, of the deep inner needs and "avowedly personal ends" that give rise to it; that is, it is consciousness experienced as human need. Metaphysics springs, ultimately, from this need, and in the end metaphysics must "be concerned with the adequacy of the explanation to the totality of our needs, to our human interest; and we cannot have any finally valid explanation until all these needs are met and our interests satisfied" (Problem of Metaphysics 15). The enigma of human existence is the origin of the metaphysical question, and it is to human experience that any metaphys ics must ultimately appeal to make sense.</page><page sequence="5">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 93 For Alexander, then, the question of metaphysics immediately involves the question of human nature, conceived in its most vital wholeness as a "person."5 This is the problem with metaphysical positions that begin with an emaciated concept of human nature or offer metaphysical solutions that ultimately make human experience meaningless, which is what Alexander finds to be the case with the "nihilism" of Bradley {Problem of Metaphysics no).6 Traditional metaphysical concepts?the meaning of knowledge, the nature of explanation, the principles of identity and sufficient reason, cau sality, and truth?all develop as abstractions from human experience, but when they are cut free from it lose all intelligibility. And this is what Bradley's system has done: It is to be hoped that this brief examination of Mr. Bradley's doctrine has not been unprofitable. It has aimed to show the ambiguities and subtle evasions that are apt to result from a dialectical procedure. Such a procedure defines reality conceptually rather than in terms of things and qualities, and discredits fact for the sake of theoretical consistency. What we want is not a world of Platonic Ideas or of Spinozistic Eternal Verities, nor yet a Bradleyan Absolute, but rather a meaning in our real ity, carnal and fleshly though it may be. And if our world turn out to be founded in contradiction, it is the meaning of the contradictions that interests us, for it is in these that we live. {Problem of Metaphysics 45)7 The problem of knowledge and the desire for a final "metaphysical ex planation" arise from human nature and must be resolved in terms that are meaningful and true to human experience. "Indeed," he says, "this is tautology?for what we mean by rationality is nothing more than the final reasons which we are forced to give for our experience, and these, as just said, must be sought in the history of the origin and satisfaction of our organic needs" {Problem of Metaphysics 114).8 The problem of metaphysics becomes the question of remembering the human being who experiences the universe from within the confines of human existence itself. The only universe that we seek to know is that part in which we exist and not some other. "We dwell within a little islet of fact. . . . What is of interest metaphysically is that we know it to be an islet and not the whole world. . . . This is our desire for metaphysical truth?a desire to know what our island means for us, what its purpose and end" (116). In this sense, the metaphysical question is not only posed by human beings, but is a creative question, one that comes to constitute the meaning of existence for the being who asks the question of the meaning of existence. Metaphysics is a creative act. What is the truth that will satisfy human desire? The truth that experi</page><page sequence="6">94 THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 enee seeks is an anticipation of its own fulfillment. As an idealization, truth comes to stand for "what we hold to be best worth while and what we hope for" (118). In other words, when we ask for "the meaning of Being" or "what is really real?" there is nonetheless a human being who must falteringly face the indeterminate future who stands behind the question, who asks it, and who tries to give some symbolic answer, our truth. "Truth then for us must always be uncertain and relative. We may feel sure that there is a fixed and immutable Truth . . . but we realize that it can never be ours. All we can hope for is that our truth will become more and more like this final Truth, grow into and approximate it, so that eventually we may learn so much of its na ture as will serve to show us some role for ourselves in the world-play which to us shall seem worth while" (122). Human life is thus a perpetual seeking guided by ideals, and it is in this sense that "the problem of metaphysics is thus par excellence the problem of teleology" (128). This much any tough-minded pragmatist might have said. But Alexander draws a sudden, and rather surprising, poetic conclusion that refers back to the fundamental creativity in the nature of the metaphysical question. Let us grant that a metaphysical idea is one that seeks to make the world intel ligible to human nature, not to some Absolute or infinite, all-knowing God. What human nature finds most intelligible, however, is the language of its own life, and it is the language that constitutes myth and poetry that opens up the depths of human existence to self-understanding. All that the world can be or mean for us is somewhat similiform with the seemings upon which our ultimate convictions rest, and out of which our ideals are constructed. We cannot say that nothing can be which is not experience. And further we can say that nothing can have a sufficient and adequate reason which is not interpreted to us in the language of our own motives and aspirations. No fact can be sufficient unto itself, and no change or action can be understood except on the analogy of human motive and intention. Hence it is that the most satis factory of all our explanations of the world are animistic. They are such as describe nature in the one language that we can grasp, the language of human emotion and impulse. Hence, too, all our philosophy and all our science which is to amount to anything or mean anything must be anthropocentric and psychomorphic. Yet if it be asked, What of truth? Is not all this but a justification of fable and poetry to the cost of that austere mistress in whose service the best genius has given all??there is an answer and a hope. And the answer is that the truth which we seek and that which human genius has ever really served is the very spirit of fable and poetry. And the hope is, that in this human truth which we</page><page sequence="7">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 95 strive to win may indeed be found the form and feature of that meta physical, ultimate Truth concerning which we can never really know. And there is reason for this hope. For we find in the human soul the center of reference for the explanation of all in our world that is or can be made intelligible to us. {Problem of Metaphysics 129)9 As we will see, it is this core sense of the true richness of personality and the drama of human life that Hartley Burr Alexander found as the basis of "sanity"?to use his preferred term?by which to measure those high abstrac tions of science or philosophy (or any ideology) that achieved consistency by ignoring major aspects of human nature. One final important point is to be found in this early work, namely Alexander's pluralism. As we have seen, it is the human person, taken in the fullness and finitude of existence, and not reason alone, that constitutes the ground of intelligibility for Alexander. At the time when The Problem of Metaphysics was written, the reigning school was absolute idealism, which advocated monism. But a reductionistic materialism, or a scientism like Herbert Spencer's, could be monistic, too. What is the appeal of any mo nism? It comes from the intellectual desire for simplicity, for a unified field of knowledge, springing from the sense we get when we have an intuitive grasp of a whole that has been idealized into a unified perspective, such as God may have. "The whole motive that gives rise to metaphysical monisms," Alexander writes, "appears to lie in an effort to obtain an intuition of the universe by an apotheosis of the principle of identity" (59). It may, he says, be "inevitable that we are compelled to conceive and represent the universe as unitary; but it does not follow that we are warranted in saying that it is unitary" (60). Positing some absolute subject gives us a "conceptual center" and also expresses the limits of our own knowledge; it is "the" universe as it is "for us." But as such, "it is an expression of our impotence: as a unifying concept it denotes the narrowness of our apperceptive powers; as a limiting concept, our inability to extend our knowledge" (61). Whatever ultimate we posit?"atoms of matter, ether, consciousness" or whatever?is some abstracted feature from immediate experience, which itself is complex and multiple. "But metaphysically, there is no better reason for saying that the universe is atoms or ether, than for saying it is olive green or a feeling of nau sea. . . . The same may be said for consciousness" (62). If all contradictions are ultimately erased, we are left with a "conception of being, so pervasively nude as to be no more than a shimmer of nothingness upon a background of naught" (62).10 Thus in the end monism does not really offer an explanatory ground; no abstraction can ultimately account for "native heterogeneity."</page><page sequence="8">96 THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 Pluralism is more rational than any rational monism because it is truer to human experience. Pluralism, however, is not to be thought of as merely positing a collec tion of independent substances. Alexander argues for what today we would call a "relational metaphysics" that is also a "process metaphysics": Organization implies nothing more than interrelation, and the relations may be between unlike as well as like things. We may even make them fixed and necessary relations, so that if one element of reality be taken away all must disappear.... To put it very shortly, we can abstract only for the sake of knowing; it is only for knowledge that triangularity exists apart from extension. In the world of fact there are no abstractions, and no subjects and no attributes, for these are only terms of convenience in the description of facts. (63) Every attempt to measure the contents of the universe and reify the mea surements?whether these be quantified views of the physical universe or the enumeration of species or archetypal Forms?commits the same error. Furthermore, metaphysical systems that attempt to reduce the many to the one or translate the phenomena into mathematical relations only cannot deal adequately with time or causality. What we need is to be able to conceive of how "the inner nature of things . . . enables them to come into such relations with one another so as to constitute new things. It is interpretation of the process of becoming in terms rather than of static identities" (93). To any doc trine that questions the reality of process, Alexander says, "Change is not only perfectly conceivable . . . but it may be doubted whether a thing is anything apart from what it does," not just in terms of activity but in terms of possibil ity as well (96). This note of temporal dynamism will come to stand at the center of Alexander s mature metaphysical position. When human existence is seen as temporal process, the metaphysical questions themselves must be seen from the standpoint of time?and so must any meaningful response. Creative Individuality: An Ontology of the Person as Process From this early analysis developed the core ideas that would characterize Al exander s mature thought. Meaning must ultimately be referred to human experience and human experience is dynamic and complex (with depths below consciousness) yet also limited. From this experience we select and abstract images, symbols, and ideas that come to represent what transcends the scope of experience or that helps organize what we do experience into a world. But, because of the complexity of experience, no one set of abstrae</page><page sequence="9">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 97 tions or interpretations can be taken as final. In seeking for meaning, human beings are also creative, that is to say, poetic. And this further underscores the genuine reality of pluralism. Exploring the possible meanings and moods of experience is what art does; not only does it give us human truth, but it shows us the inherent possibility of experience that transcends any single response or understanding. We do not fault a culture for having many poets or painters, each of whom operates with his or her distinctive vision. Why should philosophy be different? It is when we substitute some abstraction for reality that diversity becomes problematic, and it is when we try to plane philosophical language down to a standard, quantified, technological uni formity that the lyricf origins of philosophical insight are obscured. So, not only is the human person the ultimate gauge, but it is that person under stood in terms of possibilities, relations, ideals, and "moods." Life is lived out of possibilities; it is by actualizing possibilities that a unique individual existence is achieved. It is this idea of life as vital process, the realization of an individual human being, that should counter all those philosophies that seek to translate the primacy of lived time into some timeless equation. In other words, not only is Alexander s position that of a pluralist, process-oriented thinker, but the primary form of process, that which is most intelligible to us, is human life itself. As has been stated, while Hartley Burr Alexander had begun to appear in print as a philosopher, he had begun to do so as a poet. His next book in philosophy, Poetry and the Individual, reflects this interest, but also develops the philosophical problems touched on in The Problem of Metaphysics. Though nominally concerned with aesthetics, the work is really about the importance of individuality, of creative individuality, and its implications for metaphysics. Alexander begins by distinguishing the "idealism" of popular usage?the faith in ideals for conduct?from the philosophical school of idealism. Though both senses spring from Plato, they are now separate, and Alexander repeats the conclusion of his The Problem of Metaphysics: the philosophical idealists are convicted for "their cultivation of intellectual subtleties to the neglect of practical idealism" {Poetry and the Individual vi). Instead what is needed is a " humanization of philosophical interests." Poetry and the experience of beauty constitute an area in which "the idealizing motive is most manifest." Through this, however, can be discerned a "manifestation of a best humanity" and "the extension of the idealism throughout life's whole" (vi). The emergence of a love of beauty is a peculiar phenomenon of evolution, but perhaps an illuminating one, for here, "as elsewhere in the world's growth, is to be found an intensify ing evolution of individualities" (5).</page><page sequence="10">98 THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 Poetry is generated from "mood" in the sense already discussed, a "tonal ity" of existence that is an intuition or revelation of the deep self or spirit, an "insight into truth through a spiritual perspective," one "colored by person ality" (8, 14).11 Thus the emergence of the poetic in lyric, dance, and song is a disclosure of the possibilities of modes of human existence above and beyond being an overflow of bodily vitality or emotion. In epic poetry or ballads the hero becomes the focus of ethical ideals (such as Roland or the Cid for chivalry), celebrating "no real self or character, but always an apo theosized, ideal self," whose value comes from the power of the ideal that the creative mood discerns (12).12 The essence of metaphor is not as a figure of speech reducible to some ratio or logos, but as the "expansive quality of the mood" that constantly seeks the intangible and transcendent "atmosphere of vision" (15). As examples, Alexander cites the lament of an Arapaho Ghost Dancer or the erotic passion of a Sapphic lyric; we could just as well point to the raw, alienated emotions of Ginsberg s Howl or the evocative echoes of being "two-worlded" in Chinese-American poet Li-Young Lee. Beyond the words, a mood is evoked, a domain of a possible way of experiencing and existing that opens up dimensions of human being itself. "Poetry, I take it, justifies itself from this point of departure," he says. "It comes as divination pronouncing what life means, that is, telling the human moods of things" (47). He continues: The lyric cry thus interpreted is a judgment as well as a desire. It is a judgment of the?earnestness of life and of the keen vitality of spiritual being. It is a judgment of the worth of life and a demand for the clearer revelation of that worth. It is a plea for recognition of the human right in the world and the world's destinies, and it is the high seal of granting of that right. It is mans measure of God. (49) Thus, while history generates various ideal "Types," Alexander is insistent that the significance of life is firmly grounded in the individual: "The ideal individual is not an heroic soul chosen apart, but that better human nature which is the promise of all human nature" (85). The "Type" represents the ideal individual as a norm, but "the Type is a vital thing, hence a changing growing manifold thing; it is never quite the same with itself; and in the complex development which the human race has attained variation is typical; its variable term is essential to the norm" (86-87). And though the individual must be thought of as social, "the social organism does not dominate the in dividual, though his individuality grows out of it, for he is the sole measure of its significance" (87). This is why society is never a mere aggregate, but a</page><page sequence="11">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 99 genuinely living process. Indeed, Alexander asserts, "Nature herself requires the individualistic interpretation of life" (87). Individuality itself must be understood in terms of both the creativity and the power of transcendence in the Type. "The actual individual. . . can never truly incarnate the ideal self; for this self is something transcendental, magnetic, ever drawing life into the patterned way, yet ever beyond present attainment"; yet also, "the ideal is the norm and meaning of man's existence; it is the one thing for which he lives, the one thing which makes his life worth while. ..." (88-89). That is, the "Type" or ideal possible self, is open to a degree to the creative development of life?it is the possibility of meaning for a life, and that meaning is only meaning insofar as it is for that life, both as possibility and actuality. Responding to French social philosopher Jean Marie Guyau, Alexander rejects Guyau's claim that at the root of the "I" is a "we": "The we is yet an /," he says. "There must be some ultimate form or pattern of the self capable as serving as the centre of reference." (93-94). Alexander sums up: The ideal world is built up through personality.. . . Just as in the world of actuality Nature advances by slow and tentative experimentation, call ing many, choosing few, so in the ideal world men are called and few chosen. But it is the duty of every man to be an artist, a creator of the ideal to the fullness of the measure and insight vouchsafed him; only so may there be blocks for the builder and the ideal world itself be made a living possibility. . . . But more, the final meaning of the world is not racial, it is personal. For each man of us there is an ideal self as earnestly to be sought for its own sake as the world of ideals is to be sought for its sake. ... It is, then, the artist's right and duty to express as best he may his own essential nature. . . . Subjectivity is but token that more and more we are coming more and more to find the enduring ideal in things of the spirit." (103-05) It should be no surprise that Alexander places imagination at the center of this individualizing process. Imagination does not ultimately work by ap pealing to rational principles like the law of identity, a "mechanical relation"; rather, "it is a vital relating, a growing together into a new being; it is thinking by metaphor" (109). It develops organically and its type of becoming is cre ative. (Against rigid determinism, Alexander appeals to the need for variation and chance for any evolutionary theory to be coherent.) Imagination has an idealizing function in breaking free of convention and "the tavern of public thought" to bring us "face to face with our own nature," that "self hidden beneath the cumbering coverlet of communal thinking" (112-23). And, to</page><page sequence="12">THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 reiterate, this "hidden self" is not anything actual: it is itself the possibility of growth:13 "I hold that the creative process perse is the most intimate char acteristic of the human soul. It is the process of the soul's growth, the gist of the vital principle, which, could we comprehend it, would give us insight into the character and intentions of the universe such as no other knowledge could give" (153-54). But this deepest aspect of the personality is least known while the super ficial part is most familiar. Indeed, "consciousness is . . . not at all the center and substance but only the furthest outpost of the human personality" (154). Thus, art and imagination are crucial modes of access to this deeper self or character, "this wonder of human personality which in our better inspira tion we term spiritual life" that lies "behind the superficiality of passing consciousness" and exerts a will "beside which all our ordinary volitions are puny and vague" (170-71). This will is "the guiding power of a life's ideals and the molder of its personality." Our aesthetic responses are self-revelations and aesthetic expression "is the self's expression, and the motive to it is that need for whole life which from the beginning seems to have been the motif of cosmic evolution" (181).14 The question of aesthetics resolves itself into the problem of the person, and this must be understood as embodying "the complexity and concealment which make life rationally so unaccountable" (197). The common world is but an "outer fabric" and never the core personality. "The real personality is present in no actual idea, in no actual perception of the senses, and it is only in a series of ideas or perceptions that we grasp some notion of what we mean by it" (197). It unfolds in our lives as a "center of creative energy" seeking to realize an organic whole, a life. It is at work in the assimilation and transformation of reality in imagination that reveals an overall "orientation" or "consistency" above and beyond given conscious motives or desires. It "is the creator of the whole life's impression" (200). Our individual actions are ultimately measured against this "ideal self" that defines our values?that is, our loves?and our life is understood to be governed by this character as its incarnation. "Of the ultimate nature of this personality not much can be said," concludes Alexander, and yet, he maintains, "Personality is the spirit and core of our reality." (210-11). In poetry, the individual perspective is imaginatively realized, and this can be seen on a metaphysical level as well as a cultural one. For Alexander, the poet's cultivated expression of subjectivity is "but the subtler expression of Nature's creative will. It marks the growth of individuality in the world and in its prophetic form foretells the ceaseless evolution of ideal human types. For the creation of these, imagination came</page><page sequence="13">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism into being, and in them Nature justifies her painful bringing forth conscious life" (228). In developing his philosophy of the person, Alexander was led in a se ries of articles contemporary with the writing of Poetry and the Individual to explore a range of issues dealing with consciousness, the subconscious, and personality itself, among other psychological issues.15 We have already seen how he regarded the empirical, conscious personality as at best a par tial expression of a more fundamental self or character. Unlike the Freudian theory of the subconscious, which holds that the energy of the lower drives that must be redirected for social, civilized life, Alexander's view is that the subconscious self has a teleological and normative dimension implying a higher, ideal self that is constituted out of our best possibilities.16 Further more, it is the subconscious self that contains those elements that ultimately define our individuality: memory, imagination, the "hidden willfulness of moods." What "makes a mind a mind," says Alexander, "is the fact that it portrays a personality" ("Subconscious in the Light of Dream Imagery" 697). While we generally get impressions of personalities aesthetically?indeed, dramatically?insofar as personality can be defined logically it is in terms of interest and mood: "Interest is dominated by mood, mood is embryo person ality . . . mood is progressive interest, personality is progressive mood" (697). Mood is a disclosure of possibility. This elusive, "vague, half-owned self, our hopeful 'best self,'... is expressed by and engrosses our possibilities.'"17 The major encounters of our lives, such as falling in love, become actualizations of our own character, and one of the most tragic events is the failure of a person genuinely ta actualize himself.18 It is not consciousness that controls the development of personality; consciousness is the ongoing adjustment between character and environment, and self-consciousness is but a further development of this. This inner, forming power has a teleological nature?it aims at actualizing a personality. It is in this sense that Alexander is willing to entertain the possibility of the concept of a "soul" in this ontological sense without necessarily implying any further metaphysical commitments.19 But he does hold that the end of life is not the realization of the body as body, but the realization of personality through means of the bodily life, which can be taken in the Aristotelian sense of the psyche as the actualization of life, though Alexander leaves the alternate, Platonic interpretation open as a possibility.20 Thus, in Poetry and the Individual and the related essays following the publication of The Problem of Metaphysics, Alexander was working toward articulating a theory of personhood ontologically conceived as a creative</page><page sequence="14">102 THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 process. The Problem of Metaphysics had turned the tables on any position, idealist or materialist, that sought to substitute some partial abstraction of the person for the complex, deep primary experience of personhood itself; it was in terms of understanding the ontology of the person that metaphys ics would have to make sense. But part of the ontology of personhood was that it was at heart creative and the meaning it constituted in experience was poetic. This meant that philosophy itself was a creative process, an art, "the Great Art" (see Alexander, "The Great Art Which Is Philosophy"). And a philosophy that was to proceed along this line had to develop an idea of "creative meaning" or "creative rationality" that was true to experience and personhood. Alexander sought to do this with what he called "Vital Symbol ism. "Man the Measure": Vital Symbolism The humanistic orientation of Alexander s metaphysics is often linked in his work with the famous dictum of Protagoras, "homo mensura (a ): Man or human existence?holistically understood?is the measure of all things: The living man, as I conceive, is no chance play of the color of creation, but is himself form-giver and color-giver and indeed world-shaper; this is not because of any increate being which is his, but just from the fact that physically and psychically and in full use of his native endowment, he reads nature and reality in the language of his own life. His worlds are anthropomorphic for the very reason that the only cosmos he can know is known through his own experience; apart from the shapes which his body renders and the forms which his thought assumes, all is chaos; it is waste or foreign-body and is meaningless. Man is the measure of all things, of what is that it is, of what is not that it is not: we revert to this saying of Protagoras, only conditioning it to make sure that the man who is designated as the measurer and judge of reality must yet be man in the richest and fullest expansion of his powers, having in him every human part?life along with body, mind along with life, and soul or self or personality as foundation and fulfillment of each of these. [God and Mans Destiny 153-54)21 Taking this as a starting point, a " ," as Alexander liked to call it after Archimedes, we are led on to a concrete analysis of how our form of existence, our vital embodiment, gives shape to our understanding.22 In doing so, Alexander was anticipating a good deal of what subsequently was treated</page><page sequence="15">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 103 in Continental thought in terms of the "phenomenology of the body," espe cially in the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Our vital embodiment shapes experience with our very existence, and this becomes the basis for any sub sequent reflection on the world. He asks, "what metaphors most nourish the roots of our expression and best carry the messages of human intelligence?" Quite certainly these metaphors cluster about our body, about its parts and its functions and its suffused sensibility of its growing life; the cat egories of all logics are to be found in respiration and heartbeat, in the extensions and prehensions of our limbs, in eyesight and ear-hearing, in mouth-speech and gesture-speech, in food-taking and in life-bringing, and in all the metamorphoses which dramatically construe the norm and sense of the life of man. ("The Great Art Which Is Philosophy" 90) The body is our first "poetics," as anyone who has observed a newborn can attest. It is our common form of embodiment that establishes the basis of our sympathetic understanding with other persons and with those creatures whose bodies, to some degree, resemble ours. The range of forms originating with the living body that constitute the patterns whereby we understand the world, Alexander designated "Vital Symbols."23 Our upright posture divides the world into a plane with a zenith and a nadir; our frontal orientation with two sides and a back give us the four-square division of the horizon, even in terms of the primacy of the east which we face at the beginning of each day.24 The duality of our sexuality likewise pro vides a pretheoretical mode of understanding contrariety and complementary powers.25 Our articulate skeleton provides the basis of units of measurement of space: thumb, foot, cubit, mile (millepassus, a thousand paces), just as our heartbeat, pulse, respiration, locomotion, and rhythm of sleep and wak ing shape the ways we experience and measure time. Science merely refines these bodily metaphors just as mathematics develops from the "base ten" of our fingers. "The body of man is the gnomon of his circumscribing universe . . . the frame of the cosmos is bequeathed by the torsions and angulation of our joints" ("The Great Art Which Is Philosophy" 92). Science is based on abstractions taken from our more complex embodiment, primarily for the purpose of practical action. But to reduce human experience to that abstract scientific framework is, in effect, simply to leave the moving skeleton as the criterion of reality. "Space, time, and number are the ultimates of scientific reason (as now understood)," says Alexander, "but they are themselves abstrac tions of our skeletal and muscular life.. . . Of themselves they do not give us the conviction of understanding, which alone can confirm to the functioning</page><page sequence="16">104 THE PLURALIST 3 : 20 8 machine its sufficiency as reason" (92). "In the structures and actions of this living body," he concludes, "are the images and logic of all knowledge, which we call, in strict mode, science" (93). There are other metaphors as well, those which find their articulate ex pression in art and "aesthetic understanding"; these derive from the inner life of the senses and emotions, need and fulfillment, alert consciousness and dream-filled sleep?the whole domain of perception itself. The importance of sight alone should suffice, especially as it becomes the base metaphor of our range of words for understanding and "insight," supplemented by those dealing with the "grasping" of the hand. The experience of time here is not repetition, even of heartbeat, but of process, development, and transformation, filled with memory and anticipation, "musical time," as Alexander describes it, with beginning, middle, and end. "Thus space and time have aesthetic modes richer in wisdom than ever can be the pale formularies of the space and time which physical science knows. . . . Reason, then, for art is in all its elements a more significant thing that is reason for science" (95-96). There is, in addition, the "life-form of the body itself," the "Vita of Man" or "Vita Humana," as Alexander calls it. Here we find eating and its related themes of hunger and satiety, love and hate, sympathy and antipathy. But most significant is that of biological metamorphosis?the arc from birth to death. First of all the form that this offers is one of narrative transformation: we grow, mature, age, die, and each of the stages carries with it forms of ex perience and understanding, possibilities of action and existence. The general temporal form is that of drama; the specific is biographical. The various facets of human existence are all ultimately located within this pattern and derive intelligibility from it. This has implications for Alexander's very conception of philosophy: Therefore I say that philosophy, which is the quest of wisdom and of wisdom's truth, is an art, and the Great Art, seeking its finalities, not in some unoccupied scaffolding. . . but in the self-understanding of a spirit that knows itself commanded by the god to make music, and having for its instrument a mind multifariously endowed. Such a philosophy will start with the miracle which each man knows himself to be and knows his world to be; it will begin in wonder, and it will be content with no conclusion which does not return to the philosopher an image as instant and vivid as is his own life. . . . Owning such a conception of philosophy . . . holding it to be more art than science, and an art in which the pattern of the highest significance is the whole Vita of Man, there can be no misplacement of emphasis when I assert that philoso</page><page sequence="17">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 105 phy is biographical in its mode, and in method autobiographical. ("The Great Art Which Is Philosophy" 97-98) "Primitive Metaphysics": Drama as the Cosmic Category Toward the end of his life, Alexander published a connected series of essays that sets forth his metaphysics, God and Mans Destiny: Inquiries into the Meta physical Foundations of Faith. While his first philosophical work was a critique of the "nihilism" of absolute idealism, this one has an equally sharp critique of positivism and materialistic naturalism?for much the same reasons.26 Both positions ultimately dehumanize experience, that is to say, eliminate the fundamental features of personal being, which is itself the condition of all intelligibility. " The world cannot be simpler than its most complex creation" he says, and the most complex instance we know is ourselves (96). In par ticular, Alexander is dismayed by the new "religion of science"?or, let us say, "scientism"?not to be confused with the genuine practice of science. This is a popular ideology, not an experimental methodology, which has reduced the meaning of existence to a mere series of hedonistic "nows." There is no concept of a human lifetime, a "seven ages of man," prevailing; instead there is a cult of premature and perpetual youth. Human life, however, is lived as a lifetime, a "Vita"?and it is this that gives any "now" a context of meaning and value. We are temporal beings and the form of human time is teleologica! and is shaped by biological, personal, and cultural history. My statement, which I shall assume to lie beyond debate, is to the ef fect: that evidence of human intelligence and of the quality of human ity .. . lies precisely in the fact that man's mind is capable of living in measures of life which are no longer than the measures which guide animal consciousness; it lies precisely in the fact that men in the full sense of their humanity, can live in the thought of a lifetime and of a cultural tradition. {God and Mans Destiny 22) The "scientistic" view of the world makes it ultimately a thing of mea sured space and motion; but science has surpassed "scientism"?the mecha nistic view is already obsolete insofar as the new physics makes the concept of space inseparable from that of time. Alexander was fascinated by the new developments in physics that not only insisted on the ineliminable status of the perceiver in relativity theory, but the transformation of the inert, solid atoms of Newtonian physics for the world of elusive, interconnected events described by quantum theory.</page><page sequence="18">io 6 THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 Just as science seemed to promise a new, dynamic conception of nature, so in philosophy, Alexander thought, over against the various abstract and static rationalisms of the past, a genuinely temporal approach to philosophi cal issues had been proposed by Bergson. Alexander agrees with Bergson that the Western tradition has consistently endeavored to understand time in terms of space, when it would have been better to see space as a dimen sion of time; "... the physical world is an action not a thing, creation is its proper name, not universe' or cosmos.' . . . Apart from time, space is non existent, although the opposite is not true" {God and Mans Destiny 60-61; see also 185-87). But a more radical step remains to be taken: "The world as drama is still to be discovered." (42-43). The rise of both the scientific and rationalistic approaches in reducing physis to logos began with the Greeks. If reintroducing the idea of world as drama, understood ultimately in terms of human life, means a return to "barbarism," then Alexander confesses himself a "barbarian": Truly to open our minds to this, truly to see into the world's huge deed, we must pass beyond the categories of number and logic, and discover s?me more profoundly native mode of our understanding.. . . Mine is a doctrine of a return to primitivism?yes, to barbarism in the sense that it is to a mode of thought that is older than the Greeks.. . . The greater understanding, to which we are vaguely awakening, is that the world cannot be less in complexity than is the height of its creations, that the end, not the beginning of evolution gives its measure. (44-45) In other words, if the cosmos is to be understood as event, and we must see the world in terms of its greatest complexity, then not physical causality but human lived-time, that expressed by drama, becomes the richest category for understanding. History is more than mere sequence?and so is evolution. The idea of world as drama also makes possible a new conception of human existence and a viable conception of God. In terms of space, man may indeed be, as Pascal said, in between two infinities and so seemingly insignificant amid the sweep of galaxies. But to see the world in terms of dramatic time, human existence is a momentous event. Human history itself displays a dramatic teleology, for while "man is embodied, and his wisdom is mainly expressed in terms of his bodily life,. . . there is another fact about man which is a character of his life, and, therefore, part of the world's action. This is the progressive ?feembodiment of his mind, the progressive expansion of his intelligence beyond its bodily limitations" (64). It is also possible, in regarding the world as drama, to see the presence</page><page sequence="19">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 107 of God through the struggle of evolutionary time and not as some remote, perhaps unnecessary watchmaker. "It is only when we turn from the spec tacle back to the action of the world that God can be at all apparent" (69). Human existence is, ontologically, moral; it is constituted by a concern with good and evil?and this pertains as much to the issue of truth as anything, for truth is pursued, esteemed and adhered to as a value. For Alexander, truth with respect to nature resolves into trust, with respect to other persons, into "troth" (See God and Mans Destiny 70; also see Truth and the Faith chap. 1). "There are no final understandings, except in terms of good and bad," says Alexander, "... the moral sense is our human reason, and . . . apart from it there is no intelligibility" {God and Mans Destiny 70). Aside from the diversity of forms that have been given to good and evil, the distinction is universal. Alexander is careful to insist that he is only saying that the good does exist, not that evil does not, for "the bad is real even as the good is real" (71). Granted this, he adds, "Where we find cosmos we find God, for it is God only who is ordainer of the good" (71). Like Whitehead or James, Alexander rejected any interpretation of the divine as omnipotent, requiring thereby some theodicy to explain evil away when it is real. But he also rejects any "theology of transcendence," in which God is "a kind of manu facturer" or "a transcendental magician" for whom the world is a toy (74). Such a being is a product of dialectical theologies, which can be, Alexander notes, as bloodlessly rational and abstractly artificial as any science (see God and Mans Destiny chap. 6, esp. p. 108+).27 But the "God of human experi ence" and "of the great human faiths" is not like that; rather "he has been an actor and worker and maker in the midst of time" (75). God is the creative possibility for good in existence; "by God we mean that power which out of old blindness has opened and is opening our eyes, physical and spiritual, to a light that can illumine and a vision that can exalt" (75). To this Alexander adds that God is more than the struggle for good and order, for "inwardly he is a personality" that evokes devotion, which is to say "God also is love," the source of love?love itself?and the object of love, as Bergson says (77).28 Wherever the creative power of love opens before us the possibility of the good?of seeking what is best because it is so, and thereby making our lives nobler and more truly human?there God is. As a creative principle, love implies a metaphysics that is both personalis tic and pluralistic?but also a metaphysics that opens up beyond itself to "the mystic way." Love for Alexander is inherently "expressive of a relation that lies between persons, and between persons who are in essence independent of one another and capable of being comrades ... it must always, if love is</page><page sequence="20">8 THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 to be, be such that there is an association of free spirits ... a devotion, an offering, from the one life reposed in, and consecrated to, the other; love is a gift and is free" (96). Not only is love an orientation to another, it is a find ing of the self in going beyond the self, namely, the ultimate realization of the person in "self-transcension." Alexander writes, "For in love is our only convincing mode of self-transcension, involving neither mutilation nor oblit eration; it is the only broadening mode, and hence the only form of genuine creation" (188). Love is not to be limited to such superficial forms as senti ment, affection, or compassion, an understanding that comes about through a sympathy with the object, whatever it may be, that makes us become like it without ceasing to be ourselves?indeed by making us to be more ourselves than before. The process of love in experience is one of growth. What begins with love between people can also extend to aspects of the world; but "in its uttermost revelation it is known only as the full exercise of the powers of the whole person, and as the source of all expanding life" (189). While reaching outward to others, love is also a turning inward to the deeper part of ourselves. In both senses the understanding that originates in love is at odds with the modern method that begins in skepticism, pro ceeds to analysis, and ends in manipulation of nature. This other path, the "inward path" that comes to realize "in our earthly loves God's heavenly love," is not "epistemological" but Gnostic?one of self-realization that is also self-transformation, which Alexander designates "The Mystic Way."29 This "way" demands attention even if the philosopher must speak of it once removed, even if he is a sympathetic onlooker. If one grounds metaphysics upon the ontology of the person, and that ontology engages the deeper self, the end of metaphysics lies in the transcendence of metaphysics, indeed, in the transcending of any sort of "knowledge" in a public sense. The system of Plotinus, which takes reason as seriously as any rationalism does, is based on this insight.30 The mystic, according to Alexander, does not claim knowledge of all things, but "that amid the unintelligibilities that beset our lives, there is a core of essential truth, that this truth is directly and individually attainable, and that the attained is of a piece with reality" (191). This truth is not known in any other way than by being lived, "a self realization of our own inmost natures," the realization of "that impelling inner being" that desires the good (192). In other words, the person is more than the empirical, conscious self; it is more than the self that unfolds throughout a lifetime, the "character" that gives meaning to one's actions; it is more than the ideal possibilities that always extend beyond whatever we actually have realized; the ontology of the person opens the ground of possibility itself in</page><page sequence="21">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism the act of creative love. Love cannot be known externally, only by "participa tion," as Plato would say. For the mystic, this becomes union whereby "the seer, through the gift of intuition, moving into this inner life and mind, suddenly perceives that the true being of all is from this center ... it is only as knowing penetrates to the center of things, and identifies itself with this creative energy, that real being is known and wisdom, so far as may be, is achieved" (203). And it is at this point we see that "the process of knowing is genuinely one of creation." Living Mind: The House of Cultural Tradition God and Mans Destiny expressed a profound distress over the tendency in modern civilization to eliminate the sense of culture and human life, reducing the meaning of existence to the immediate "now." What makes a life human is the fact that any given moment fits into a life pattern, a history, so that its meaning lies in its relation to what is before and after. In developing a philosophy based on the idea of the person, not only must the deepest aspects of personhood be taken into account, but the temporal ones as well and these include the social, cultural, and historical dimension of "mind." Human beings exist in cultural traditions, which provide a range of symbols that seek to make life and the universe intelligible in the terms that we understand best?the modes best exemplified by religion, the arts, and philosophy. Cultural traditions thus enable new members of a society to engage in a temporal mode of existence beyond personal memory. Cultures thereby help human beings exist in awareness of their full personhood, to transcend the immediate and make it part of an enacted, unfolding dra matic meaning that is the expression of character. Culture also symbolizes the full scope of the "Vita Humana," giving us a sense of the "stages on life's way." In short, culture provides the condition of human existence in the cosmos. And while it exists for human beings, it cannot be reduced to an aggregate of persons, for cultures not only transcend any given group of people, but they have their own dynamic processes of development, flourishing, and demise. In the scope of cultural history, there is an evolu tionary sweep that even goes beyond any particular culture. And it is here that Alexander speculates about the possibility of an evolution of human consciousness through history. The unfinished text that explores this is Living Mind: An Inquiry into the Psychological and Logical Foundation of Human Understanding?1 The title refers to the themes that mind is not only embodied in a structural way, but</page><page sequence="22">no THE PLURALIST 3 : 20 8 in a temporal way as well?that life has a teleological dimension in human existence as drama.32 It is an essential feature of our humanity that we are born into a "house of thought," a culture (?100). This constitutes much of the scene and make-up of our dramatic character as persons that thereby enact "some moment in Human Nature." Beyond the two embodied features that give us the range of "vital symbols" (the physical body and our distinctively human forms of experience), there is a third constituted by our cultural con text, the dimension we have as "political animals," to use Aristotle's term; human nature is as ontologically grounded in this shared, social, cultural, and political life as it is in its physical organism. In addressing the general nature of intelligence, Alexander discerns five basic forms: the level of consciousness, the level of reason or "the structure sense," the level of imagination or the "architectonic ideas," the level of vi tal symbolism, and the level of cultural tradition. Consciousness includes all degrees of "sense" taken in the most general way; it is "the inner lumen of organic experience" found in all sentience in the animal kingdom; it is mostly "a chaos of sporadic instants," and even in human intelligence is a "chain-like series" (?101). The structure sense discerns forms of things or actions mani fest in practical action, projects causal sequences, or makes classifications. "All such reason," Alexander says, "might be given the more general form of problem-solution" and involves analysis, selection, and synthesis (?101). While highly developed in human beings, it is evident even in insects, such as the nest-building of wasps or bees or the migrations of birds. Thus it is a sort of primitive response to a sensed structure in the world.33 The level of the architectonic ideas or "imagination" taken in a sense beyond that of mere image-making is a synthetic power of forming concepts and categories that can be highly refined in fields such as mathematics, logic, and the sciences. But it may also consciously abstract qualities and aesthetic forms, as it does in the arts. They are "architectonic" because in "the precise Aristotelian sense" they are "poietic, involving all the causes (aitiai) which Aristotle distinguishes in poietic genesis" (?101). This seems to be distinctively human. Vital Symbolism, as we have seen, includes the basic psychophysical forms whereby we make sense of the world, "the great functional background of human intelligence." Alexander writes, Among men they are rarely understood in any more than a technical fashion; and their logic, which is the foundation of every special logic (such as the linguistic, mathematical or artistic), is yet to be reduced to comprehensible terms so that "an exposition of its principles might be</page><page sequence="23">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism iii regarded as the organic logic of human nature itself, parent and form of all the individual logics of the individual sciences and arts" (?ioi).34 Finally, the level of cultural tradition or history denotes the various clusters of symbols and their developments due to various interests that give actual content and direction to specific cultures, constituting the "inherited furni ture of the House of Mind" (?101). Any human being is born into a cultural world that gives him or her a first language of thought and meaning, one which, however much one may creatively transcend those forms or learn those of another culture, will constitute the "home" of the mind whence it began its journey. The ways in which different languages discern time is a prime example.35 Water may have the same chemical substance around the world, but its meaning will never be exactly the same for one who grew up in a desert as for one who comes from England. A yearning for clouds, light ning, and rain dominates the religious images of Pueblo Indian art and not that of the ancient Celts, and this difference in cultural disposition can be seen in the poetry of Simon Ortiz of Acoma Pueblo and Irish poet Seamus Heaney. One further feature of a culture of "House of Mind" is that it man ages to achieve a degree of harmony among the major interests present in any culture: economic, political, religious, scientific, and artistic. With the progressive integration of the levels, comprehensive patterns become realized and mind becomes "self-intelligent" so that "the apparent development of human intelligence is really a process of self discovery, both for the individual and for the race" (?102). Alexander raises the possibility this is also "world discovery," with "world" functioning as a limiting concept? i.e., "that of which we can be intelligent" (?102). Likewise, inquiry into the nature of mind is also a disclosure of metaphysical understanding. As he asserted in The Problem of Metaphysics, Alexander holds that metaphysics is an open-ended project, necessarily involving a plurality of positions not only over time but at any given time. We cannot be certain that our own self-knowledge is complete, and so our understanding of the world may not be either. Aside from the possibility of the evolution of consciousness, there may be modes existent that have other forms of access to the world. These levels are the ones that are, however, communicable. Tradition is the living development of a "culture-mind" and is not to be confused with chronological measurement or history, which is the reflective study of tradition, and so abstracts and symbolizes aspects of the living real ity, just as someone writing an autobiographical self-interpretation must. But what is represented is nonetheless a "Vita," not a static structure or mechanis</page><page sequence="24">112 THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 tic process. Just as persons develop according to diverse interests that define their characters, so cultural traditions may display only a few interests or give emphasis to some and not as much to others, giving thereby character to the culture. In this sense one may speak of a "culture mind" or a Culture Vita, when taken in its vital, dynamic sense. For the sake of studying traditions, Alexander finds five primary inter ests: the economic, the political, the religious, the scientific, and the artis tic. These are at best "cues to history," but "there are excellent reasons why such a limitation must be no more than tentative" (?105). Moreoever, any attempt to reduce the interpretation of a culture (or all cultures) to one, the way Marxism does in the name of economics, is exposed as reductionistic. "To be sure," says Alexander, "one may reasonably question the adequacy of an interpretation based only upon five interests . . . but if the five be real in the fashions affirmed, that interpretation which takes all into account is assuredly more capable of truth than is any that deliberately limits itself to one or to fewer than five" (?106; see also ?109). When applied to past or alien cultures, these may simply be categories that help organize inquiry. But when applied to our own traditions, they become tools for self-criticisms and intelligent, directive control. For example, all cultures have some degree of political order, but when political order becomes an explicit focus, perhaps due to need?such as the Athenians coming to Solon or the Hebrew tribes coming to Samuel, the political interest has become a conscious part of the cultural tradition capable of reflective criticism and redirection. It is individual human minds, however, that are the actual "carriers" of a culture, the means whereby it is given embodiment. This does not reduce culture to an aggregate of minds, but it does mean the life of a culture is a function of the relational dynamics of the members over time, that is, their interactions. Minds form "an interactive consciousness" that participates in a tradition; there is a degree of creativity in which this may happen, from the minimal one of a mere unreflective inheritor of the past, to one who seeks to redirect and transform the culture from within (?107). Indeed one of the main functions of "our liberal and emancipating education" is to give mem bers of a culture some imaginative exposure to the history of that tradition and others for the sake of a greater creative intelligence in participating in the culture itself (?107). Education is very much essential to the life of the culture: "In the end, the fate of a tradition is the fate of the minds which carry it" (?io8).36 The bulk of Living Mind is devoted to an analysis of each of the five in terests by which a culture may be understood. First is the Economic Interest.</page><page sequence="25">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 113 All life clearly springs from a need to secure goods in the world, exhibiting an economic interest, but the meaning of a monastery, like Thomas Mer ton's Gethsemane, which has an economic life in order to exist at all, is not comprehended by its economic aspect; indeed, even the daily labors of the monks are contextualized within the spiritual life. And it is for this reason that there is danger today in the tendency of university and college administra tors to think of their institutions as businesses. Once the true purpose is lost to sight, direction becomes impossible and all the inner rationale collapses. The economic life of a culture can be understood in terms of environment, work, industry, intercourse (trade and transportation), and wealth. This last, Alexander divides into vital and symbolic. Vital wealth is "that product of industry which is directly taken up into the Tradition, and which is evalu ated in the sense of being directly lived" (?110). Here we have the physical aspect of a cultural tradition?preservation of buildings, monuments, art works, laboratories, texts, music, schools, and so on. It contains all that a given culture regards as "familiar" or as its own and as such is inalienable. Symbolic wealth is "pecunia" or "potential wealth: human opportunity"; this form is alienable, such as money or trade goods, and so deals with creativity and discovery and is subject to "transaction and adventure" that "enables the exploration of cultural experience." (?110). The Political Interest, like the others, at first exists in a preconscious form of life that may become the subject of conscious reflection as tribal societies engage in trade or warfare or attempt to formulate the mores of the group, and so contains, at least implicitly, a view of human nature. Here, too, vari ous categories may be distinguished: domain (territory and population along with a vague sense of homeland to an organized concept of "dominion"), consanguinity (or kinship, racial and class relations), state (with Grotius, the "habit and voice" of a people that gives rise to law), society (the range of as sociations based on diversity of interests, such as religious or economic, linked with the political as a general context), and " utopianism." This last denotes the "special moral bearings of the Political Interest," ideal models of good and virtuous conduct and their contraries; these may be tacitly implicit in the culture, such as the classic Greek virtues of justice, courage, self-control, and wisdom, or the ancient Persian virtues of knowing how "to ride, draw the bow and tell the truth," or those consciously articulated, such as Plato's Republic, the "cosmopolis" of the Stoa, or the ideal of a classless society (?111). The Religious Interest has as its "foundations and substance," Alexan der says, the "sense of sanctions attaching to every form of human activity" (?112). These may be manifest as taboos and duties or in the distinctions of</page><page sequence="26">IH THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 sacred and profane, holy and polluted, or righteous and sinful. This interest is categorized by: morah (sanctioned options such as purification, divination, or the virtue defining piety); ritual, sacerdotalism (the designation of people defined by sacred persona and the holy life); mythology ("the depiction of deities and powers" vivified by vital symbols); and theology (or "the effort to construe religion into a science") (?112). The Religious Interest has an influence that the other four interests do not insofar as it is "very certainly the key to the distinctiveness of each moving Tradition in a sense in which none of the others can be a key; and this is due, no doubt, that in supplying us with sanctions it profoundly modifies every form of selection: conduct is the manifestation of culture, and religious sanctions are the shapers of conduct" (?115). The Scientific Interest is, in Alexanders view, "simply the equivalent of Knowledge conceived to be at once theoretically expressible and practically significant" (?113). "Science" is used here to refer to anything in the con tinuum from knowledge to wisdom. So this includes everything from techn?, praxis, and phron?sis to "all that comes to pass upon the fertile earth"?the lure the Sirens offer to Odysseus?to the Form of the Good "itself by itself."37 This broad area can be subdivided into forms of wisdom (variously understood: cleverness, insight, "book learning," scientific method, and so on), possession of wisdom (either as the acquisition of accumulated, organized technique or as a personal and inward realization), the pursuit of wisdom (education prac ticed as a general cultural institution or as an initiation into a special, perhaps esoteric, knowledge for the few), and the value of wisdom (that is, knowledge valued for its own sake as an inherent realization of human nature and the desire to know). The Aesthetic Interest is, according to Alexander, "the most difficult to segregate" and probably is "the last to develop into a critical consciousness of its own character" (?114). It plays its role in economic production, political life, religious forms, and even in science when that assumes aesthetic form, as in the dialogues of Plato. But even in the service of these other interests, the arts have developed their own concerns, foundations and languages. Alexander catego rizes the Aesthetic Interest into functional divisions (adornment, symbolism, fine art), art in society (such as the distinctions of craftsman, master, patron, "artist" in the modern sense), aesthetic morality (the ideal of the aesthetic or artistic life, the idea of a "beautiful life" itself), and the sense of beauty. With regard to this last, while ideals of aesthetic beauty vary among cultures and individuals, the existence of such variety itself points to a common human interest and desire. Art has significance for the Vita of the Tradition above and</page><page sequence="27">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 115 beyond individual experience; the heritage of art often defines the Tradition itself. The discovery in 2005 of the missing half of a poem by Sappho (raising the number of complete poems by her to four or five) was not just acquiring another piece of archeological information, but a recovery of a precious work of art. "In the end, then," says Alexander, "the Artistic Interest takes the form of a forth-figuring of the Vita of the Culture Tradition, in the suite of that mode which the sense of beauty assumes within the Tradition; and ifit achieve a great art, it is because the life of the Tradition has been great" (?114). To this Alexander adds a final thought, unfortunately left undeveloped. "The great business of Art, it would appear, is to ritualize the Tradition, to elucidate its meaning in the subtlest and most varied language open to man, and thus to set forth for all time whatever is the gift and meaning of the Culture" (?115). This gift and meaning, he continues is "necessarily meta physical." Cultural traditions do not exist merely in the immediate physical "now" any more than a person does; like a person they exist with reference to time and "past and future belong to a metaphysical realm of mind" (?115). The metaphysics of culture deals with the dimension of time by which the present is made meaningful. There is also a "cultural finality" to each tradi tion and this its "gift," that is, what is inheritable by other cultures and ages even though that culture itself be forever dead. As we saw in his earliest work, Alexander found the importance of metaphysics to be in the question of meaning, not in strict ontology alone. In this sense, each tradition is a "gift" to the developing human heritage, not just to the cultures that may follow directly from them, but also to all humanity. It is the meaning of a culture that is ultimately what is communicable and which may add to the life of another tradition. In this sense, though Greek culture cannot be revived as a living culture, its "gift" to the cultures following it has been immense and has shaped the life of Rome, the Renaissance, and so on.38 And it is through culture as it becomes enriched by the past and by the diversity of traditions that the "house of Mind," that is, the human spirit, evolves. Therefore, that education is best, Alexander asserts, which "opens the more doors of histori cal understanding" (?115). Perhaps the exploration of cultures may gradually discern a "Cosmic Vita" of the development of humanity itself, an overarch ing life of spirit. But in any case, the question of traditions is a metaphysical one. "The true foundation of a metaphysics which is to deal with a world that is inclusive of all human interpretations of it, past and to be, can certainly be no less than the metaphysical truths of which these interpretations, these Culture Vitae, are the impressed forms. Once again our argument brings before us the challenge of a First Philosophy" (?115).</page><page sequence="28">u6 THE PLURALIST 3 : 20 8 Christianity and Native American Religion It would be helpful to see how these general themes were implemented in a concrete way in Alexanders studies of those two religious traditions, both so close to his heart, though one in a conflicted way: Christianity and the religious symbolisms of North American Indian cultures. Recall that for Al exander the essence of religion was not theology?theology actually was an expression of the "scientific" (that is to say, rational) interest. Religion itself however was an expression of life and so spoke in those "vital symbols" that are the final intelligibility of the world for us. Religious consciousness is that which approaches the world both as a symbolism and an enigma, for a sym bol always points beyond itself. In terms of Alexander's own metaphysical language, it would be a mode of access into that domain of creative possibility that lies beyond the immediate physicality of the "now." The "God-endowed men," those who have lived lives that disclose the scared dimension of exis tence, have given us insight into our "nobler possibilities," which Alexander sums up in the term "Pattern Man" {God and Mans Destiny 107). We do not?or should not?read the Testaments to discover a theologi cal system. "It is the story element of the Testaments that has made of the testaments truly . . . because the essential reading of them is actually com posed of the acts and moments of our human living. . . . Man finds his own pattern self, far more than God's being, mirrored in the Scriptures; and it is this humanization of the universe which becomes the heart of his faith" (116). For example, in the Gospels it is the life of Jesus that is compelling, for in his life he showed a new way of living where the Kingdom of God was already among us in the spirit of love. His life revealed a possibility in us that could function as a conscious ideal. "In each human being there is a shuddering duality: on the one side his historical and factual self, and over against this that pattern man which he feels he should be, and, had he the metal, could only be" (116). In this sense the "Logos made flesh" is the "logic of the Pat tern Man" and the incarnation is "the embodiment of man's ideal of his own shadowy nobility" (117). In Truth and the Faith, Alexander writes, "As with no other who has been called teacher his doctrine was his living, and the image of the vital man was his message to the world..." (53). And the life of Jesus in turn illuminated the lives of ordinary people and those who lived nearly invisibly, too insignificant to be worthy of notice in the eyes of the ancient world. Jesus saw in them that they were "deep vessels of humanity itself" and "creators of reality" (57). The world,</page><page sequence="29">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism as seen through the life of Jesus, is no material phenomenon to be geometrized, but rather a "physical parable" asking to be understood symbolically, that is, as living meanings requiring the full range of the human spirit to discern. Each of us is also, therefore, a parable, and so Jesus spoke that we might see each other not as rich and poor or powerful and weak or even as male and female, but as intimate members of a family, children not of a distant, hidden god whose name must not be spoken, but of a "father," abba. The image of Jesus as the Christ belongs with similar mythic embodi ments of the archetype of the sacrificed deity whose death brings life?there is nothing absolutely unique about Christianity in this. But, Alexander says, the myths reveal through the stories of these beings how one life may illumine a whole dimension of ideal meaning, one that then becomes accessible to others and a pattern by which they may live. Such ideals may evolve into a tradition. In the West, since the late Roman Empire until the rise of modernism, that tradition has been "Christendom." But, as we have seen, Alexander believes that modernism has essentially abandoned this heritage?not as a theology or institutionalized "religion," but as a "living mind," a vital and creative source of human existence. The new idols of modernism have little to do with Jesus or Christian ideals. They are: the state, progress, the "pursuit of happiness" as the end of life, and "Science" (understood as "scientism"). The result has been the loss of a sense of the Vita Humana, life as the drama of character enacted with a sense of the ideal, for a focus on immediate, present sensed existence, the transitory passing moment. The final paradox, Alexander says, is that "men have come to look so many men, so many?upon human religious experience as a thing to be explained, and not itself the explanation, regal over all" (266). The highest expressions of civilizations have been ultimately those of its religious self understanding, and these have not been constituted of dry theologies, cre dos, rituals, or beliefs, but of faiths by which whole human lives are lived and through which they are realized. "Religion has been reason, in a degree which no other of our wisdoms has touched our understandings" (267-68). Human existence is ultimately a question of faith because it is a matter of choice. "Thinking is choosing . . . and living is also choosing" (268). In the dynamisms and struggles of nature, ideals have nevertheless arisen and com manded allegiance, and these are what have shaped the drama of history. [W]hat assuredly we find in our living actuality... is a moral structure. Whatever more the world may be, none can truly say that it does not embrace what is for us better and worse, and what is for us desire or</page><page sequence="30">8 THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 disgust. Now these words of themselves mean choice. They mean that in some actual sense, apart from all determinisms and choice-denyings, there exists, real with the real, in the very substance of Nature, agencies of selection that are not only path-distinguishing, but are also prompted by attraction and by repulsion, by love and by animus. The situation is not mechanical; it is emphatically moral; and this is to say that it de scribes a freedom in the only sense in which freedom can have meaning, and that is as expressing the existence of such a thing as character. Now men do not have characters; they are characters; and the same thing may be said of civilizations, and perhaps of worlds. (269-70) As already noted, the new physics reveals a world of creative process in which selectivity is present and which is fundamentally temporal, that is to say a "transformation and transfiguration" (277). For self-understanding, we must turn to the vitality of our own living, "the most complex selec tive action that we know; and nothing less than the most complex can give us measure or reason" (277). Values govern human life, and the highest of these are the creative ideals that have sustained cultures over the ages. "Re ligion is not to be understood except through a sunlight of understanding penetrating enough to lay clear the impulse that asks man to escape himself and redeem himself, and purify, and in some manner to find out a life that is his, bettered and transfigured" (290). In the West, those ideals have been expressed in Christian symbols. If those symbols are abandoned, Alexander asks, how will we be able to live life in terms of the Vita Humana, as a life of spirit, instead of its being reduced to a succession of experiences aimed at the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of boredom? What can discern or symbolize for us the "Pattern Man"? Thus what Alexander finds at the roots of Christian religion are those symbols that express the metaphysical reality of the fullness and drama of human life. It is one of the ways in which the human spirit has responded to what is deepest and most real in itself, and this has meant a faith in those ideals that realize what is best in us. In his last book, The Worlds Rim, Alexander undertook to discuss a series of Native North American rituals and through this to show that here, too, we found the human spirit symbolizing its ideals for realizing a fully human life, for enacting the Vita Humana. Although dressed in the various tribal expres sions, Alexander finds that these rituals "echo what other groups of men in other natural settings have found to be the human truth" and so pose "a chal lenge to our self-understanding that is as deep-sprung as our remotest genesis, in those aspirations of our human nature which in many lands and in many</page><page sequence="31">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 119 times take form in the human spirit and shape our humanity" (xvi). What a study of Native American rituals reveals is a "metaphysical problem" for us "as to what is human nature and what are the necessary forms of thought which emerge from the experiences of living to shape a philosophy of the world: what must men think in order to be human at all . . . ?" (xvii). The rituals examined are: the pipe, the standing tree, the sweat bath, the corn dance? those which reveal "a vision of a world"?and those which interpret life, the Pawneee Hako, the Sun Dance, rites de passage, and the "Mystery Way." I will focus here on the ceremony of the calumet or "peace pipe" from the first group and the Hako from the second. Few things are more emblematic of the sacred in Native American culture than the so-called "peace pipe"?it is in essence a mobile church that can orient and center the communicant with that totality of sacred being called by the Lakota Wakan Tanka and by the Algonquins Gitche Manitou. When bowl is joined to the stem, it is re garded as a sacred and living being. The physical pipe itself is a symbolism of the human body: the stem its "male" aspect, the bowl its "female" aspect, the tube the air passage from nostrils to lungs, and so on to the smoke itself as the living spirit that goes up in prayer. "Behold this pipe. Verily a man!" goes an Osage chant ( Worlds Rim 20). The pipe is smoked and presented to the four directions, usually (but not always) beginning with the east and passing sunwise, completing the circle of the earth and thereby placing the communicant at the center, but connected to the whole spiritual universe. The sky and earth may also be addressed. Standing Bear, a Lakota chief, says, "The pipe was a tangible, visible link that joined man to Wakan Tanka and every puff of smoke that ascended in prayer unfailingly reached His pres ence" (8). The "radical metaphors" revealed by the ceremony are first of all the presence of the human body as a way of understanding space, the four-sided frame of the body itself, the orientation to the beginning of light and the day, the zenith, nadir, and center referring to the vertical stance?the basic "world frame" rooted in our vital symbolism. The completion of the circle points to "dramatic time" with its beginning, middle, and end, culminating in completion and wholeness. Alexander explains, "The pipe is itself, in some deeply indefinable sense, a mystic token of man's union with nature, and like the Christian cross, of his temporal and spiritual salvation" (23). A ceremony that illustrates the symbolism of the Vita Humana is that called the Hako by the Pawnee, though it is known to other central plains tribes as well. The Arikara call it Priaskani, "Many Children." Here we have a celebration of the child that means the renewal of the group?for as the</page><page sequence="32">HO the pluralist 3 : i 20 8 individual seeks continuance, so does the tribe. Hence the common repre sentations of the archetype of the "divine child" that is also a savior, Horus, the Buddha, and, of course, Jesus. The child as such is "the emblem of life" (107). While the immediate meaning derives from parent-child relationships and feelings, "the essence of the ceremony is to give a new social benefit and spiritual protection to the child, and, even more, to bring all elements of the good life to all of the participants and their kindred" (102). This includes the fundamental virtues?kindness, generosity, honesty?as well as prosperity and health. It could also be performed as a ritual of adoption or guardian ship. The main features were related by a Pawnee holy man, Tahirussawichi, to the distinguished ethnologist, Alice Fletcher: We take up the Hako in the spring when the birds are nesting and car ing for their young, or in the fall when the birds are flocking, but not in the winter when all things are asleep. With the Hako we are praying for the gift of life, of strength, of plenty, and of peace, so we must pray when life is stirring everywhere. (103) The ceremony itself was long and quite complex, with public and hidden aspects, involving two groups of prominent men, one being "the Fathers" and the other "the Children." A summary of the first day may give some in dication. It would begin with an invocation of the world as a holy place, "a House of Life," home to the great powers as well as to men: High Heaven, the Winds, Sun, Earth, Water, and so on, to Fireplace, Coals, Fire, and the Entranceway of one day to the next. Two Hako wands are used (giving the ceremony its Pawnee name), adorned with various feathers, one blue, symbol izing Sky, and the other green for Earth. An ear of corn (also painted with blue and green) represents the power of the earth to bring forth life, "the mother breathing forth life" (106). Even the water used in the paint has meaning as "the continuity of life from one generation to another." A spirit journey to the Lodge of the Son is undertaken, inviting him to come to the tribe. There is a reception and feast, both done with thoughts directed to Tirawa atius, "the father of all things."39 At night, sacred visions are invoked because, says the Kurahus priest, "We receive help through the visions" (hi). Visions come during the night and just before the earth is awakened as all things begin to stir. Says the priest, "This is very mysterious; we are speaking of something very sacred, although it happens every day" (hi). The dawn itself is the child of Tirawa atius and the earth, and it brings the gift of life to all things. The Morning Star is honored with a song; the Day and the Sunrise are greeted by</page><page sequence="33">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism all. At the end of the ceremony, the children are called, so they come "flock ing like birds, shouting like eagles," and a blessing is given: Breathe on him! Breathe on him! Life thou alone can give him. Long life, we pray, Oh Father, give unto him! (125) Alexander adds: The Ceremony of the Hako is throughout symbolic, but the symbol ism is so elemental that it must seem the very portrait of truth as truth appears to the mind untaught in science. Further, it is a symbolism that is not merely Pawnee, not merely American Indian, but in its main fea tures it is world-wide. Hardly a hint is required to make it intelligible to any human being who has breathed the free air of open country, who has looked up to the blue sky, to sun and moon and stars and mov ing clouds, who has looked about him at the green earth and glowing fields. Indeed, we may say that the Pawnee conception of the frame and governance of the world is nearer to the ordinary thinking of even educated men than is the conception which the science of astronomy presents. For however honestly we may believe astronomical doctrines, they are still doctrines that must be intellectually mastered and held: they are not instinctive in human experience. (130-31) Conclusion We have seen how the thought of Hartley Burr Alexander aspired to express a philosophy of the person that ranged from psychology to metaphysics to cultural anthropology. Beginning with a rejection of both rationalism and materialism, Alexander tried to reorient the problem of rationality and nature within the idea of lived human life. Rather than measure human existence by a formula or a physical event, he sought to understand the meaning of existence as rooted in the Vita Humana. As this Vita transcended any immediate mo ment, so it stood within the context of a Cultural Vita that transcended any human life or set of lives. Symbols, myths, poetry, drama, rituals?these were not items of superstition or confused ignorance to be dismissed by "Logos" or the light of reason or science. The most abstract algebra does not escape its mythic origins in the lived body or, if it did, it would then cease to be intel ligible at all to us. Philosophy has a job to understand the cultural heritage of humanity, to carry it forward to new living minds and to sustain that "house</page><page sequence="34">122 THE PLURALIST 3 : I 20 8 of mind" that gives individuals being as persons. In other words, he conceived of philosophy as a humanistic praxis in which no facile "method" would be able to replace the obligations of cultural literacy and imagination. This put him essentially at odds with the directions that Anglo-Ameri can philosophy has been heading in the twentieth century and on into the twenty-first. Perhaps it is not too surprising that now there is a good deal of self-questioning as to whether "Philosophy" (as practiced in the last century) has anything to offer beyond a genteel ironism or more aggressive deconstruc tive mission. The cognitive philosophy project hopes one day to remove the "folk language" that has us still talking about "selves" and "thoughts" and "feelings" for a truer, more brutally exact neurophilosophical terminology.40 Whatever the merits of Hartley Burr Alexander s own proposed ideas, the possibility of a genuinely humanistic mission of philosophy remains a viable and needed project. "It is for the philosopher to point the way. It is for him who hath eyes to see the Vision" ?Plotinus NOTES . Except to the sensitive eyes of Francis M. Cornford (see From Religion to Philosophy [1910]). A "myth" is any story that a person or group tells to itself to understand who he or she may be or who they are and to reveal the meanings or identities of main features of the world that have significance for them. In this sense, philosophy tells myths about itself; so does science. 2. To say nothing of the near genocide of the Native American peoples; some of Alex ander s earliest literary works respond to the Wounded Knee Massacre. 3. Particularly scathing criticisms are reserved for Bradley (see The Problem of Meta physics 42-45^); elsewhere, Alexander treats Royce with great respect while disagreeing utterly with Royces "Answer to Job." See "Beauty and Pain" in Nature 183. 4. This term, "mood" carried a special significance for Alexander that bears a curious resemblance to Heidegger's concept of mood (or Stimmung). In Poetry and the Individual, Alexander says, Were I to be asked for a term which might most accurately designate the psychi cal matrix of poetry, I should suggest mood, for by "mood" we mean an attitude of mind which is neither purely of the intellect nor purely of the emotions, but derives something from each of these and adds thereto a subtle tone and quality growing out of the predispositions of the soul. Mood is a kind of insight. It is not insight into colorless intellectual truth, nor is it a state of personal bias such as is consequent upon emotion. Rather it is an unfolding of what is deep-lying in character, a revela tion of spiritual diatheses and of the nature of that which is most native and lasting in us. Hence, expression of mood, if the expression be true, seems to represent an</page><page sequence="35">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 123 insight into reality more fundamental and inevitable than any other. It is insight into truth through spiritual perspective. It is poetic insight. (7-8) The awareness of this mood from "deep unrest" also calls to mind Heidegger's description of the ground of the Seinsfrage in his Introduction to Metaphysics. 5. Again, comparison may be made to Heidegger, for whom the meaning of the ques tion of Being was sought by asking into the being of human existence, Dasein, which asks the question of Being in the first place. 6. In other words, Bradley's position drains human experience of all meaning on its own terms to save the logical consistency of a dialectical system. Later, toward the end of his life, in God and Mans Destiny, Alexander will critique the new positivists and ma terialists from the same standpoint, pointing out that they have reduced the meaning of human existence to nearly nothing, the immediate "now" and nothing more. 7. This criticism is leveled against Josiah Royce as well: "Another view is that of Prof. Royce, who sees in the Absolute an apotheosized self, the Individual. At first sight this is eminently satisfying; but when we try to find the self that we know?which serves as the basis for the metaphor?we cannot identify it with any segregated part of experience" (The Problem of Metaphysics in). And with regard to Royce's famous "argument from Error," he says, "It is not at all clear how the inclusive Thought which Professor Royce raises up to account for truth and error can account for our truth and our error, the truth and error we recognize as such" (119). 8. "In a way the problem of ontology is a false problem. It cannot be answered except by metaphors. The one reality the esse of which we can and do know is the reality that is immediately ours. But our reality is finite and bounded by our impotence. It compels us to infer reality beyond it. And it is because of this and because even over the real that is known to us we have no unconstrained control, that we ask the why of it and try to find an answer in the essence of that which is beyond" (The Problem of Metaphysics 102). 9.1 have changed Alexanders occasional use of British spelling to standard American usage in this and following quotations. 10. Alexander says this in reference to Hegel, perhaps somewhat ironically since it echoes Hegel's caustic criticism of Schelling s philosophy as the night in which all cows are black in the preface to The Phenomenology of Spirit. As a characterization either of Hegel or Schelling, it is not altogether fair. 11. See note 4, above. 12. Unlike science, which Alexander conceives to be completely utilitarian, "Poetry is an end in itself. . . as imaginative realization of beauty... ; it represents that transfiguration of human thought and emotion, by capacity for which man has been enabled to wrench free from the brute and in human image to create divinities" (Poetry and the Individual 13). See p. 53 for a description of scientific knowledge as utilitarian. 13. Needless to say, this puts Alexander's poetics utterly at odds with the hedonism of Santayana's Sense of Beauty as well as with the classical-minded critics who seek only for the "universal" in art. See Poetry and the Individual 146+. 14. "Aspiration toward the ideal is, indeed, the essence of our instinct and of our life, and its fullest attainment... is to be found in expressions and appreciations of beauty. But the ideal itself is meaningless save as a character and form toward which our experi ence can and must evolve. It must then be contained potentially in human personality and in the human subjective self" (Poetry and the Individualize). 15. These are: "The Concept of Consciousness," The Journal of Philosophy (1904), "Some</page><page sequence="36">124 the pluralist 3 : i 20 8 Observations on Visual Imagery," Psychological Review (1904), "Phenomenalism and the Problem ofKnowledge" Journal of Philosophy (1905), "Human Personality" Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research (1907-08, reprinted in Nature and Human Nature), and "The Subconscious in the Light of Dream Imagery," Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research (1909). The last two essays are of special importance. 16. In "The Subconscious in the Light of Dream Imagery," Alexander writes, [I] ordinary talk we continually distinguish the "true" or "real" self from the trai torous and false selves of our unworthy deeds and moods. We recognize various types and degrees of inner fission, and have a long-standing myth of an innerly conflicting better and worser self. Now the true self of this common-speech distinc tion is commonly the under-struggling better self; however bad we find ourselves consciously to be we still have a lurking conviction that, given the appropriate chance, a now suppressed goodness would assert itself as lord of the domain and as the souls verity. (696) Alexander makes the additional remark that those psychologists who tend to view the subconscious self as "brutal" and "immoral" comes from the fact they approach the subject "from the standpoint of pathology." "There is no question that psychopathology has worked wonders in revealing to us the hidden structure of the mind; but it is an easy danger to allow the diseased mind to be taken as a model of the mind sane and whole, especially where the subconscious is concerned." 17. See "Human Personality" {Nature and Human Nature 242). See also God and Mans Destiny, where Alexander writes, "No man can live all his possibilities and no actual world can exhaust the possible: yet apart from the possible no man nor world at all could ^"(138). 18. The archetypal instance of this for Alexander is Hamlet, who never actually ac complishes anything in the play; "Hamlet s nobility is his ideal self?the self we know so vastly better than he knows it; and his tragedy is the tragedy of wrecked possibility, the fine soul gone awry" {Nature and Human Nature 245). See also God and Mans Destiny 168+. 19. In Nature and Human Nature, Alexander writes, We have, then, already a partial clue to the character of a man's hidden self: It must be an ideal, form-giving character; it must represent a life-motive and hold a kind of balance of power as between events, so yielding what we call freedom of choice; it must be made up of anticipations of experience held as in perpetual leash for the possible occasion of their realization. A man's soul cannot be less than the sum of his capabilities and since these are invariably deduced from their partial display in the conduct which aims to realize them, it is hardly thinkable that the soul can be other in kind than a fuller, inner realization?that is, its nature must be an exten sion of our own idealizing consciousness. (257-58) 20. Alexander repeatedly appeals to Aristotle in his early writings, providing something of a counterweight to his more Platonic tendencies. As noted, he had spent his first year with Newbold studying Aristotle intensively, though Newbold himself was disposed toward Platonism. 21. See also Truth and the Faith 62; Worlds Rim 19. 22. Archimedes said, "Give me a place where I may stand (pu? sto) and a lever long enough and I will move the earth."</page><page sequence="37">Alexander : Humanistic Personalism and Pluralism 125 23. The most extensive treatment he gives of this in his published writings is in "The Great Art Which Is Philosophy," but he was working on a more extend and detailed analysis at the time of his death; see especially the manuscript "Vital Symbolism." See also Truth and the Faith (chap. 2) for an extensive analysis of the role of sight in our un derstanding of intelligibility. 24. Thus the importance in human cultures of the numbers three (from the vertical axis of below, here, above), four (from the horizontal plane), and seven (both together). See the extensive application of this in World's Rim, chap. 1. 25. Not only do many cultural mythologies generate the world from cosmic matings, but we see intellectual refinements of these symbols in early Greek philosophy (which extended even to male and female numbers) and in Chinese Taoist thought. 26. Alexander sees "the materialistic tradition" as fundamentally the heritage of the Greek approach to nature, not just of the genuine materialists like the atomists, but of those philosophies that considered the cosmos fundamentally as a thing. "We have lived intellectually so long and so seatedly in this materialistic tradition (which is the mate rialistic tradition), that we forget that for all men and times outside the Greek-formed world the conception of the world as a material reality, or as the core of reality, has never existed" (Truth and the Faith 58). Alexander's view of science as a method was that it was an expression of a faith in method and so ultimately moral. But simply to accept specific ideas dogmatically because they are "scientific" at the time is not science but scientism. 27. At one point, Alexander rather acidly remarks, "Thus theology like science becomes cosmic in its outlook: it is God alone that is to be saved" (God and Mans Destiny 112). 28. Alexander cites Bergson's Les deux Sources de la Morale et de U Religion (Paris, 1932), 270. His marked-up copy of this book attests to his close study of it. 29. The article, "The Mystic Way," reprinted in God and Mans Destiny, originally ap peared in The Personalist, 1933. 30. Here in this essay as elsewhere, Alexander shows a careful understanding of Ploti nus, probably originating with studies with Newbold but furthered through his use of the bilingual edition of the Enneads, with the Greek edited and translated into French by Emile Br?hier. 31. The meaning of the proposed title may be found in the following: But just as in our own blemished bodies we can see traced the symbols of our souls, and indeed just as the body's form becomes for us more and more the spirit's writ ing, so that we speak with one another not as mechanical contrivances but as living minds, so we may conceive that God is a spirit communicant in bodily forms, shap ing, as radiant energy shapes stars, the lights and loveliness of natural things; or yet, he may be that energy itself, and the stars his ideas, and the whole world his drama and his life, and the seal of his impressed will. (God and Mans Destiny 95). 32. I think, perhaps, that it was the significance of this dramatic (and biographical) nature of human time that made the original project of "functional psychology" appear to be in need of total overhaul. 33. Insofar as it may be manifest as instinct in animals or as reason in human beings, I suspect that Alexander is here following the thought of Bergson. 34. I take that it is the functions of intentional abstraction and creative synthesis that characterize "imagination" or the "architectonic ideas," whereas the actual basis from which such abstractions can arise are comprised in the realm of vital symbols. Thus, while the body by its structure and living rhythms gives a vital basis for our symbolic compre</page><page sequence="38">126 THE PLURALIST 3 I I 20 8 hension of space and time, any number of creative formalizations, using abstraction and synthesis, of space and time can be made with varying degrees of rigor, ranging from a hunting tribe's "year count" to the Mayan calendar to Aristotle's Physics or Newton's Principia. No doubt the psychophysical body is the basis of "reason" as a structure-sense too, though in a more instinctive way. What Alexander seems to be getting at with this level is a sort of projection of a "world" generated by organized activity; I would guess that J. J. Gibson's idea of "affordance" comes close to what Alexander means by structure sense. An affordance is the way an animal grasps an object?like a level to perch on or something to eat. See Gibson's The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception. On the level of the structure sense, we use reason without reflecting on it, but when we reflect on reasoning and refine its methods, we are using imagination or architectonic thought.
