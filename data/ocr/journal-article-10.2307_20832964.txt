<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-MUTAZILISM DETLEV KH?LID A. THE GENESIS OF A RENAISSANCE About a millennium before the intellectual encounter with European rationalism the Islamic community experienced a similar inroad of ex traneous ways of thought upon its religious concepts. It was only a short-while after the incorporation of Syria, 'Iraq, and Persia into the Muslim state when the long established religious denominations started an intellectual counterattack against the revolutionary faith of Islam. The Jewish, Christian, Dualist, and Materialist schools of thought rested on the solid foundations of their systems which they had set up with the help of rational disciplines, mainly Greek philosophy. Many converts to Islam gradually began to assimilate the new religion to their old beliefs. This was done partly unconsciously, partly consciously, and in a number of cases with the intention to work for disintegration.1 Of course, the born Muslims of the first generations sensed the danger of disruption but it were precisely many of the sincere believers among recent converts to Islam who recognized the issue at stake in its full dimensions.2 Given the challenge and being well acquainted with the weapons of the opponents they started to use them in the service of Islam. Thus the school of Vtiz?l came into being. The adherents of this school3 are the MuHazila or, in the European derivation, Mu'tazilites, meaning literally "seceders5? or "separatists".4 They are mostly called "theolo gical rationalists"5, but the labels given to them vary from Freidenker des Islam* to "dogmatiques intol?rants a Vextreme1). Kenneth Cragg, a learned orientalist, names them a prominent group oj theological adventurer^ and for the Lebanese scholar Albert Nader they are simply the premiers penseurs de VIslam? Islam as a religious polity came into existence at the outer border of cultural cross currents and with its intended plainness it seemed insufficiently equipped to master the new problems. It were the Mu'tazila who formulated for the Muslim community the answers to menacing questions of the older civilizations. Their answers covered the religious as well as the cultural aspects. At the height of Muetazilite supremacy, during the reign of Caliph Ma'm?n and his immediate successors, Greek philosophy and science in its neo-Platonic transmission attained to a creative synthesis with Islam.10 In the history of the</page><page sequence="2">320 DETLEV KHALID entire realm of Islam a cultural synthesis of comparable success can hardly be found.11 But since its defeat at the hands of the fundamentalists in 850 the Mu'tazilite school of thought has been outlawed and its teachings were no less extinct than its teachers and their writings. In Zayd? Yemen, their only reservation, they lived on in splendid isolation without rele vance to the world of Islam.12 Shibl? Nu'man?, one of modern Islam's most outstanding theologians in the Indo-Pak subcontinent, rightly said that were it not for some references and hints in a few books we would not even know that such a school ever existed.13 In the Arabic-speaking world it was Muhammad 'Abduh (1849-1905) who took up their tradi tion for the first time in the modern age. Defending Islam against the attacks of the French minister Gabriel Hanotaux and the Arab Christian Farah Ant?n he used Mu'tazilite argumentation to prove that Islam is neither fatalistic nor hostile to science.14 But, notwithstanding his unmistakable identification with numerous Mu'tazilite doctrines, he did not dare to mention the name of this school in a positive context for fear of fundamentalist opposition. However, much in his reformulation of Islamic thought urges for a reassertion of the Mu'tazila.15 A generation later, this impetus given by 'Abduh was led to logical consequences by Ahmad Amin (1886-1954). Again, it was not merely a rational pursuit of 'Abduh's modest beginning but also a recognition of the spirit of the time in which Ahmad Amin lived. 'Abduh's groping endeavours to set some basic reforms into motion were more than the powerful traditionalists could tolerate.16 Similarly, 'Ali 'Abd al-R?ziq's thesis about the unpolitical character of the early Muslim community proved to be a hazardous enterprise with bitter consequences.17 Thereafter proceedings took place against T?h? Husayn on account of his critical study on legendary contents in the Holy Qur'?n.18 But all these intermittent advances in the struggle for a greater freedom of thought were not fruitless. The establishment of the Egyptian National University under the directorship of the liberal Lutf ? al-Sayyid created a weighty counterpoise to neutralize the Azhar Univer sity of the traditional scholars.19 Ahmad Amin lectured Arabic litera ture at the National University and later on became Dean of the Faculty of Arts. Thus he experienced the self-confidence of the avant garde of free thought at its most vigorous source. Simultaneously he experienced a challenge to his attachment to Islam. As it appeared to him, to hold one's own could hardly be warranted without rational underpinning.20 These two factors led to a candid reversion to the Mu'tazila school of thought.</page><page sequence="3">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-MU'TAZILISM 321 An additional factor was his co-operation with the Swedish orienta list H. Nyberg who edited in Cairo (1925) the Kit?b aUlnti$?r of the Muctazilite dX-Khayy?t. After several centuries this was the first time that a Mu'tazilite work was made accessible to research. Formerly such research depended solely on information drawn from the polemics of the opponents of the Mu'tazila. Part of Ahmad Am?n's assistance was the translation into Arabic of Nyberg's introduction to the edition.21 But of no less importance or perhaps even more decisive than the factors mentioned above was the positive description of the Muetazila by the modernists in Muslim countries outside the Arab world. In an article on Le Renouveau du MoHaziUsme Robert Caspar has ably traced the beginnings of neo-Mu'tazilism from Muhammad 'Abduh to Ahmad Amin. As regards the Egyptian scene we are certainly indebted to Caspar for the profoundness of his treatise. But the want of linking his research up with similar developments in the wider Islamic context has been responsible for the fallacy of considering neo-Mu'tazilism in Egypt or the Arab world an isolated phenomenon that has its origin in the person of Muhammad 'Abduh.22 Similar reintroduction of a number of Mu'tazilite conceptions can also be found with the 18th century 'modernist' Sh?h Wal?-All?h of Delhi. He too avoided scrupulously to mention the name of this banished school of thought. But his chief interpreter and propagator, 'Ubayd All?h Sindh? (1872-1944) was no longer scared to point out to the identity of Shah Wal?-All?h's teachings with Mu'tazilite doctrines. As an example, he refers to the question of n?sikh and mans?kh, i.e., the abrogation of certain earlier revealed verses of the Qur'?n by later ones. In his book Sh?h Wal?-All?h awr unk? Falsaja 'Ubayd-All?h Sindh? shows that Wal?-All?h did not consider any verse as abrogated. He gave rational explanations which were to prove the continuous validity of the verses that were said to be mans?kh with the exception of five. But if his method of finding out the individual purport of so-called abrogated verses is applied to the remaining five it will be discovered that especially these ones cannot at all be considered as abrogated. Their particular and everlasting independent significance becomes apparent beyond doubt. Therefore, Sindh? concludes, Sh?h Wal?-All?h did not insist upon a wholesale rectification of the abrogation theory because the five verses which he omitted from his piecemeal explanations do not stand in need of interpretation. He could easily leave them undiscussed for the sake of appeasing the traditionalists. Sindh? says further: "Sh?h Wal?-All?h does not at all conform to the views of the traditionalist thinkers that certain verses in the Qur'?n are abrogated</page><page sequence="4">322 DETLEV KHALID by others. But while refuting the common beliefs and attempting to correct them he chooses the modes of expressing himself with prudence. He knows that the learned had accepted the theory of abrogation in the Qur'?n long ago. Anyone who totally rejects abrogation would be counted among the Mu'tazila and, therefore, his opinion will not be heeded. With an eye on this general trend of his contemporary scholars, Shah Wall-Allah endeavous to explain this question by degrees."23 As far as the motivation of having recourse to the Mu'tazila is con cerned that of 'Ubayd-All?h Sindhi is probably the most peculiar one. He aimed at creating a new self-view for the Muslims of the Indo-Pak subcontinent because he felt they were too slavish in their admiration of Arab Islam. This wishful attachment to an alien past had made them overlook their own glorious contribution to Muslim history and, more over, it had cost them the respect of other Muslim nations.24 Being first and foremost a nationalist, 'Ubayd-All?h Sindh? viewed the conflict between Mu'tazila and Muhaddith?n (conservative scholars of tradition) as a struggle between Persian and Arab mentalities. During the time of Ma'm?n, he writes, Arabs had lost all influence on governmental affairs. They had no symbol of greatness left to them except their language. To safeguard this residue of superiority they insisted upon the divinity of Arabic. That is why we regard most of those who attached more importance to the words than their meanings to be propagandists of Arab hegemony. Most of the Arab scholars fought for the doctrine of the Qur'?n's eternity. A typical protagonist of Arab supremacy was Imam Sh?fi'?. As against him the non-Arab Im?m Ab? Han?fa held the Qur'?n to be created; similar is the case with Im?m al-Bukh?r?.25 During the twelve years of his exile in Mecca 'Ubayd-All?h Sindh? was dejected by the Arab scholars' unwillingness to accept him and other Indian or non-Arab 'ulam?9 as competent authorities on Islam. He was particularly pained by the fact that "in the mysticism of Shah Wal? All?h they smell Iranianism and Indianism. And it is obvious that in their eyes Iranianism and Indianism have nothing to do with Islam."-? 'Ubayd-All?h Sindh?, therefore, followed the example of his ideal, Sh?h Wal?-Allah, by furnishing an ideological basis for established facts. He called the Hanaf? school of law, which is anyhow absolutely dominant in India, an "Aryan" school and declared it to be the Indian national interpretation of Islam. In contrast he regards the "Semitic" school of Sh?fi'? as the Arab national version of Islam. In pan-Islamic bodies, however, both are to stand on equal footing.27</page><page sequence="5">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-MU'TAZILISM 323 Muhammad Sarwar, a leading authority on Sh?h Wal?-AU?h and 'Ubayd-All?h Sindh?, recapitulates: "In short, with regard to the question of the Qur'?n being created Ma'm?n's advance was meant to correct the superiority complex in Arab mentality. In his view the insistence of the tradi tionalists that the Qur'?n is uncreated, was a stumbling block tp the aspired healthy fusion of Arab and Iranian thought. As this was against the political interests of his empire, Ma'm?n pursued the matter so energetically. Mawl?n? 'Ubayd-All?h Sindh? says that during this period many non-Arab scholars, who were not less learned than their Arab counterparts, did believe the words of the Qur'?n to be created.28 . . . With Ma'm?n the Persians had gained a certain intellec tual supremacy and to some extent the Mu'tazila movement was a manifestation of that superiority."29 'Ubayd-All?h Sindh? made use of the Mu'tazila to stress his point with regard to the Indian cultural sovereignty within the universal Muslim community. He was not really a neo-Mu'tazilite in the stricter sense. He adopted Ftiz?l as a model to further national ends but pre cisely these are ultimately better served through Wali-All?hism which re presents not just an lajamt brand of Islam but one that is genuinely Indian. Nevertheless, to Sh?h Wal?-All?h we owe the inception of the Mu'tazila renovation and any propagator of his thought is bound to provide this movement with buoyancy, as did 'Ubayd-All?h Sindh?. "For him (Wal?-All?h) 'reason and argument' had perhaps a more fundamentalist significance, but they inspired the formula of neo-Muetazilism of Sayyid Ahmad Kh?n, who had received his early education in the seminary of Wal?-All?h's successors in Delhi, of Shibl?'s scholasticism and of 'religious reconstruction' in the thought of Iqb?l."30 That 'Ubayd-All?h Sindh? could so frankly disclose the Mu'tazilite inclination of his chosen Imam Wal?-All?h was mainly due to Sayyid Ahmad Kh?n (1817-1898). Starting with him Indian Muslim moder nists loved to call themselves neo-Mu'tazila, and to claim resuscitation of the aims and aspirations of that enlightened party of Islam. Thus adherence to Mu'tazilite conceptions was openly confessed in India much earlier than in Egypt. In this context too the role of Jam?l al-d?n al Afgh?n? is to be regarded as of central importance. Before starting his preaching career in the Middle East he studied in India.31 It is, there fore, difficult to imagine that Indian neo-Mu'tazilism had no repercus</page><page sequence="6">324 DETLEV KHALID sions on Egypt. Even if we make due allowance for the bitter dispute between al-Afghani and S. Ahmad Khan on the concept of naturalism the least we must say is that Indian and Egyptian neo-Muctazilism ran parallel. Due to the isolation which British imperialism enforced on "our Indian Mussalmans" the two branches could not meet each other during the initial phase, but the increasingly closer contact between Indian and Egyptian thinkers that followed in the wake of the progressive liberation of both territories made the trends of neo-Muctazilism con verge to a considerable extent. Nevertheless, Goldziher observed in his study of Qur'an-interpretation that: "It is hardly possible to ascertain whether the Egyptian en deavours are an effect of impulses radiating from India. There is some reason to answer this question in the negative. It is an im portant fact that the literary manifestations of the Egyptians do not betray any connection to the Indian movement. They derive their inspiration rather from genuinely orthodox Islamic authorities of earlier centuries or at least they strive to refer to them as justifying models but never to modern Indian precursors or partisans.5'32 He goes on to say that there is an essential difference in the spirit with which both camps aspire to carry out reform: "The Indian neo-Muetazila characterizes itself as representa tive of a cultural movement. It is the result of deliberations to which the circles of Muslim intellectuals were forced by the confrontation with the Europeans who overpowered them. Their efforts at reform are influenced by European culture. For them theological view-points are of secondary importance. They take them easy and deal with them nonchalantly and without much scruples. As against that, the Egyptian movement bears the stamp of theology. Its demands for reform are deduced from theological consider ations. They are free from any outside influence. The Egyptian movement insists upon the removal of malpractices not because these are inimical to culture and do not fit into our time but rather because they are inimical to Islam and stand opposed to the spirit of the Qur'?n and the authentic traditions."33 This finding of Goldziher, even if taken as a generalization, cannot be accepted as accurate. In fact, it does not do justice to either of the two groups. With regard to India he was certainly misled because his research was confined to those modernists whose works were available in English. Goldziher acknowledges this shortcoming when he says that</page><page sequence="7">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-MU'TAZILISM 325 he is not aware of the trends expressed in the local vernacular Urdu.34 His observation about the cultural movement as a reaction to the impact of modern European civilization is no doubt correct when applied, as he does, to Sayyid Ahmad Khan and especially to Sayyid Amir . It is, however, out of focus when we examine the works of, e.g., Shibl? Nu'm?n?, who wrote in Urdu. Goldziher's characterization of the Egyptian modernists applies to Nu'm?n? almost more aptly than to 'Abduh. This notwithstanding, Shibl? Nu'm?n? contributed more to the revivification of the Mu'tazila than the illustrious reformer of al-Azhar. Moreover, Shibl? Nu'm?n? did not hesitate to call the child by its name. His numerous books abound with references to the Mu'tazila. His monograph AL-MA' M?N (written in 1894) was the first book devoted to a Mu'tazilite giant and since then similar studies have been ever on the increase: 'ASR AL-MA'M?N (Cairo 1927) by A. Far?d Rif?'? and IBR?HlM BIN SAYY?R AL-NAZZ?M (1946) by cAbd al-H?d? Ab? R?d? are perhaps the most outstanding ones among them. Moreover, in his book on Al-Ghaz?l?, Shibl? Nu'm?n? has taken pains to prove that even this great Im?m of orthodox Islam departed in many ways from the narrow viewpoints of Ash'arism, the reactionary school of thought that uprooted Mu'tazilism. He adduces numerous issues which al-Ghaz?l? adopted in conformity with Mu'tazilite interpretations. By reintroducing certain Mu'tazilite argumentations al-Ghaz?l? had in fact cleansed Ash'arism of much of its anthropomorphism.35 "Shibl? approached Western values from the viewpoint of Islam. His programme was not to reform Islam with some new criterion but to revive it from within, his ambitious vision including the rehabilitation of Islamic learning in its entirety, along the lines of its flowering under the 'Abb?s?s in Baghd?d.... He envisaged his task as that of the rationalist Mu'tazil? sect of the early centuries of Islam, to produce a synthesis of Islamic doctrine with philosophy (in that case Hellenist); and, accordingly, to combat irreligious thought.36 Shibl?, unlike Sir Sayyid Ahmad Kh?n, accepted the whole of Islam, with its history; knew it and loved it; and, grasping the necessity of expressing that Islam in terms understood and appre ciated by the modern half-Westernized world, set about to do so. Typical of his method, and his whole viewpoint, is that, before pro ducing his theology for today, he wrote a preliminary history of theology in the past,37 ... After his endeavours to rehabilitate theological learning at the Lucknow seminary, he set about to</page><page sequence="8">326 DETLEV KHALID organize a school o? Muslim learning. Hence the Writers' Institute (Dar al-Musannif?n) at Azamgarh, sometimes known as 'Shibli's Academy', which he instituted and endowed the year before his early death."38 Besides, in 1892 Shibl? Nu'm?n? visited the Near East and contact with the Egyptian modernists M. Rash?d Rid? and M. Farid Wajd? was maintained even after his return to India.39 An indication of the extent of his echo in Egypt we find in the T?r?kh al-Tamaddun al-Isl?m? (1906) of Georgi Zayd?n, whom he served as a source. This latter work set the start for Arabic cultural historiography in the modern age. It served as an inspiration for the epoch-making work of Ahmad Amin who fre quently cites Zayd?n.40 We have already mentioned that 'Abduh made use of Mu'tazilite argumentation in his defence of Islam against Christian critics. This defence was twofold, as was the criticism. There was the Christian missionaries' attack that was to be countered on a more theological level and there was the blot put on Islam by Western secularists who considered it a stumbling-block in the way of cultural advancement. This latter criticism demanded a restatement of Muslim cultural values. Goldziher rightly calls Jam?l al-d?n al-Afgh?n? the initiator of the Egyptian move ment and refers to his dispute with the French scholar Renan in the Journal des D?bats. In a way he even acknowledges that al-Afgh?n?'s contribution is rather in conformity with the cultural movement of which S. Am?r cAl? was most symptomatic.41 If, however, we accept his previous judgement as valid with regard to Rash?d Rid? and a number of other Egyptian writers we find it restricted to the initial phase of the Man?r-group, i.e., the period with which Goldziher's study concludes. B. THE SPELL OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND THE SPIRIT OF MODERATION With Ahmad Amin neo-Mu'tazilism in Egypt reaches its culmi* nation, but what the "vulgarisateur" of Mu'tazilism42 advocates can hardly be distinguished from the Indian revival of this school. It could not be otherwise, because in one of his early essays he candidly expressed his deep admiration for "our Indian brethren" who preceded the Egyp tians in paving the way for a healthy combination of traditional Islamic learning with modern Western science. S. Ahmad Kh?n, S. Am?r Al?, and Muhammad Iqb?l have created the "missing link" between the ancient and the modern sciences, between Muslim culture and European civilization. They are equally at home in both.43 Ahmad Amin lauds their efforts as setting a good example for Egypt and from then onwards</page><page sequence="9">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-MU'TAZILISM 327 he propagates their line of thought. This has left traces not only in the collection of his essays in the leading cultural magazines Al-Ris?la and Al~Thaq?ja (the essays were later compiled as STREAM OF THOUGHT) but also in his series of books on Islamic history. He cites Iqb?l's thesis on THE DEVELOPMENT OF METAPHYSICS IN PERSIA and Am?r 'Al?'s SPIRIT OF ISLAM (in FAJR) as well as Khud?bakhsh. "several English writings from India", and even HUJJAT-ALL?H AL-B?LIGHA by Shah Wal?-All?h (in ZUHR, Vol. II, p. 83). Filially, it was his COMMITTEE OF WRITING, TRANSLATION, AND PUBLICATION44 which brought out the Arabic version of Iqb?l's RECONSTRUCTION OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT IN ISLAM.45 Since Ahmad Amin, like Goldziher, did not know Urdu, he was also unaware of the more theological brand of neo-Mu'tazilism that marked the works of Shibl? Nu'm?n? and others. Am?n's advocacy of revived I'tiz?l as a cultural movement stemmed from his acquaintance with the writings of S. Am?r cAl?, above all. Whereas S. Ahmad Khan and his lieutenant, Chir?gh , dedicated themselves to the dissemina tion of Mu'tazilite doctrines46, S. Amir 'Ali was more concerned to put the Mu'tazila in the proper historical perspective as it appeared to him. Speaking about W?sil ibn 'At?', one of the founders of I'tiz?l, he says: "For several centuries his school dominated over the intellects of men and with the support of the enlightened rulers who during this period held the reins of government, it gave an impetus to the development of national and intellectual life among the Saracens such as had never been witnessed before .... 47 Mu'tazilism spread rapidly among all the thinking and cultural classes in every part of the Empire, and finding its way into Spain took possession of the Andalusian colleges and academies. Mans?r and his immediate successors encouraged Rationalism, but made no open profession of the Mu'tazilite doctrines. Ma'm?n, who deserves more justly than any other Asiatic sovereign the title of "Great", acknowledged his adhesion to the Mu'tazilite school; and he and his sons, Mu'tassim and W?thiq, endeavoured to infuse the rationalistic spirit into the whole Moslem world. Under them Rationalism acquired a predominance such as it has not gained perhaps even in modern times in European countries."48 For the conservative preachers Am?r 'AH's historical perspective becomes altogether alarming when he deals with the Caliph al Mutawakkil, hitherto celebrated as the restorer of the faith: "A cruel drunken sot, almost crazy at times, Mutawakkil had the wit to perceive the advantage of an alliance with the latter party;</page><page sequence="10">328 DETLEV KHALID he would become at once the idol of the populace, and the model Caliph of the bigots. The fiat accordingly went forth for the ex pulsion of the party of progress from their offices under government. The colleges and universities were closed; literature, science and philosophy were interdicted; and the Rationalists were hunted from Baghdad. Mutawakkil at the same time demolished the mausolea of the Caliph 'Ali and his sons. The fanatical lawyers, who were now the priests and rabbis of Islam, became the ruling power of the State."49 Goldziher is surely not far removed from truth when he calls this exuberant eulogy of the Mu'tazila as somewhat overdone.50 The merit of Ahmad Am?n lies in the fact that while upholding the basic truths expounded in the lines quoted above, he subjects the matter to profound and well-balanced historical research. The standard of his scholarship has been widely acknowledged by the Muslim elite as well as by Western orientalists.51 Besides, he never sought to emphasize that Islam is of basically Arab character?which is, according to Goldziher, typical of the Egyptian reform movement. The broader approach of Ahmad Amin was apprehended best by Egypt's veteran literate and historian, T?h? Husayn, who wrote in the preface to FORENOON OF ISLAM: "I do not know any scholar of the history of Arab literature who was as successful as Ahmad Amin in establishing the relation ship between Arabs and Indians or between Arabs and Persians."52 As a consequence of this attitude Amin was certainly more receptive to Indian neo-Mu'tazilism than his colleagues at the university who subscribed to some form of nationalism or the other. Concomitantly he did not urge a return to or revival of the 'golden age' of the "rightly guided" three or four first caliphs, rather he was enthralled by the 'Abb?si period and in his historical works he is at his best when dealing with the age of I'tiz?l. If the cultural renaissance of Egypt before his time really resembled what Goldziher calls Kultur-Wahhabismus Ahmad Amin had definitely emancipated himself from it. In 1912 appeared in Cairo for the first time a History oj the Jahmiya and the Mu'tazila by Jam?l al-d?n al-Q?sim? followed in 1925 by Kurd 'AH's Ancient and Moderi which contains a chapter on I'tiz?l written by T?hir al-Jaz?'ir?. Still it was quite a revolutionary venture for an Azhar-trained scholar that Ahmad Amin dedicated a dozen pages to the theological rationalists in his first historical research work, the DAWN OF ISLAM (1929). Two,-thirds of the third volume of the FORENOON OF ISLAM (1936) are devoted to the discussion of their school of thought.</page><page sequence="11">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-MU'TAZILISM 329 He deals with the development of the concept of Islamic theology ('Um al-kal?m) extensively, explains the "five theses" of the Mu'tazila,55 introduces their main representatives and discusses the dispute over the question whether the Holy Qur'?n is created or co-existent with God. For centuries past this problem was considered to be dead and buried once and for all. A critical discussion of this question could not be interpreted but as heresy.56 His conclusion is daring in a double sense: "I am convinced that men like al-Ma'm?n, al-W?thiq, and Ahmad Ibn Ab? Du'?d were sincere in presenting their opinion. What they said they took to be the truth, and I agree with them that it is the truth, although I disagree with their point of view that all people should be told all the truth."57 Robert Caspar emphasizes the originality of Ahmad Am?n's exposition of the Muctazila which he sees manifest in its charactere litt?raire et humain?* This is reflected in his presentation of the most distin guished representatives like al-'All?f, al-Nazz?m, and al-J?hiz as well as in the characterization of the "Mu'tazila mentality" in contrast to the gloomy faith of the masses. For the first time since the victory of the fundamentalists over the theological rationalists the history and doctrines of the latter were set forth extensively and sympathetically by a staunch Sunn? in such a way that "tout esprit impartial doit admirer V equilibre 9 Vobjectivite et le sens des nuances"** With all that Ahmad Amin's attitude toward theological rationalism is not free from ambivalence* On the one hand, he extols the Mu'tazila as the defenders of Islam. Whenever he emphasises this function of theirs he stresses that their free-thinking knew only one restraint, viz., the a priori supposition of God's existence and the limits set by His revelation.60 "The theologian adopts the position of a loyal 'advocate' who is convinced that his case stands for truth and, therefore, takes up the defence. He finds arguments to evince and to corroborate what he believes to be right."61 The case is different with the philosopher. Though he may not always be able to free himself completely from all influences of back ground and environment he nevertheless makes objectivity the base of his research and asserts the result at which he arrives without regard for beliefs. "The position of the philosopher is that of a just judge."62 And it is exactly this function which, on the other hand, he attributes to the Mu'tazila whenever he wishes to recognize in them the model of a 'scientific' Muslim:</page><page sequence="12">S3? DETLEV KHALID "They gave reason full scope to examine all matters without putting any restriction... They did neither fix a definite sphere in which it was allowed to operate freely, nor did they recognize a realm in which it was not free to do so."63 The connection is established when he says that the theological rationalists introduced Greek philosophy into Islam, but then, again, he draws a clear line. According to him theological rationalism is differentiated from Islamic philosophy by organic growth as a genuine discipline of Islamic thought?comparable to jurisprudence (fiqh) and rhetoric (bal?gha). Theology is the result of a protracted process of opening up question after question. As against that philosophy has been taken over from the Greeks as a ready-made product. It is Islamic only in the sense that Muslims have engaged in it and have written commentaries: "Therefore, we acknowledge theology as an Islamic science, although it contains some elements of Greek philosophy. But the philosophy at which al-Kind?, al-F?r?b?, and Ibn S?n? worked, we cannot call Islamic philosophy."64 Thus, basically, Ahmad Amin sees in philosophy the model for entirely unrestricted scientific research. On the one hand, such a model is his concern. On the other hand he sees in it the example of a one sided assimilation to a foreign culture, it is not in conformity with his motto of "Lopping and Grafting" (al-taql?m wa l-tat'im)65, but is just mere implanting. It does not correspond to his cherished ideal of synthesis. That is why at times he transfers the model of a research unrestricted by dogmas from philosophy into theology. The entrance of philosophy into Islam via theology serves as a bridge for crossing the contradiction in this construction. But his frequent references to the limits imposed by revelation makes the contradiction all the more apparent.66 "The liberation of thought"67 suffers a loss to avoid a preponderance of the foreign. Synthesis takes precedence and for the sake of preserving Muslim identity this synthesis cannot be visualized except in conformity with the supposition that the Holy Qur'?n in its totality is the word of God: "With the (Mu'tazilite) theologians reference to the verses of the Qur'?n and reliance upon them had precedence over the appeal to Greek philosophy and dependence on it. In fact, theology is a mixture of both, only that the Muslim personality finds stronger expression in it than in the philosophical studies".68</page><page sequence="13">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-MUTAZILISM The philosophers, no doubt, built upon the wreckage of the Mu'ta fcila, but they did not occupy themselves with Islam except when it be came necessary to bring a philosophical opinion into conformity with religion. "With their philosophy they were like a Greek delegation in the land of Islam. They had nothing to do with the interests of the nation, no concern with the actual life of the Muslims among whom they lived except in case of a dispute. The Mu'tazila, on the other hand, wanted to rule, they wanted reforms and desired to guide. They were not content with a life in isolation."69 Thus there is also an ethical motive that caused Ahmad Amin to give preference to the Mu'tazila over the philosophers. Visualizing himself as a mu$lih he harboured an esprits de corps for 'reformer-craft'. "For this reason I do not share the opinion that the philosophers assumed the role of the Mu'tazila. In fact the dominion of the traditionalists was never challenged by the philosophers. The latter praised God that he kept them safe from the former. The only desire of the philosophers was that the felicity which they felt in their other-worldly metaphysical thinking should last for ever."70 As against this the example of the Mu'tazila encourages t? advance into the future, to advance toward Muslim renaissance: "After the inquisition, the cause of th? Mu'tazila lost its vigour and for about one thousand years the Muslims remained under the influence of the conservatives. This lasted until the modern renais sance which certainly exhibits Mu'tazilite traits: It knows doubt and experiment, both methods of the Mu'tazila, as is evident from, e.g., al-Nazz?m and al-J?hiz. It has faith in the rule of reason. It believes in free-will with the resulting accountability of man. It respects the freedom of discussion and of research. Man lives in it with the consciousness of his personality. All these are principles for which the Mu'tazila fought and died. The only difference be tween them and the modern renaissance is that Mu'tazilisrn rested on religion, while the modern renaissance is based on pure reason .it has no relation to religion, in many respects it is rather outside the pale of religion."71 The Mu'tazila promoted the development of personality because they liberated man from superstition by projecting a new conception of God. It was a lofty conception raised above the anthropomorphic ideas of the traditionalist simpletons who believed in an arbitrary ruler-god seated on a throne of clouds. Since this despotic god of theirs had not</page><page sequence="14">332 DETLEV KHALID bound himself to the obligations of justice, man, in his impotency, was driven to seek the intercession of spirits (jinn) and saints.72 The new conception of a gentle God of love in justice produced that spirit of in vestigation, that inquiring mind of scholars in the front rank of whom Ahmad Amin?following Iqb?l73?finds the great Mu'tazila al-Nazz?m and al-J?hiz.74 The perspective in which he sees the Mu'tazila is apparent from his alternate use of the terms Al-MuHazila wa l-Muhaddi thun and Al-Ibtik?r wa l-Taqlid (Invention and Imitation).75 His expectations with regard to the revival of the Muctazilite school find recurrent expression in his writings such as: "They stimulated thinking, incited it to do research and turned toward problems which nobody before them had taken up. They broached innumerable subjects in theology, in natural and political sciences."76 There is the same emphasis on the "scientific spirit" which marked THE SPIRIT OF ISLAM as portrayed by Amir 'Ali who wrote: "Distinguished scholars, prominent physicists, mathematicians, historians?all the world of intellect in fact, including the Caliphs, belonged to the Mu'tazilite school."77 With this accentuation they are, no doubt, on sure grounds. Re trospect to Mu'tazilism, classified as torchbearer of the scientific spirit, is appealing not only to Muslims. Rudi Paret, most recent translator of the Qur'?n into German, pays homage to their investigating mind in an article entitled "An-Nazz?m als Experimentator" : "It becomes clear at first sight that here we have an achieve ment which is highly significant for its scientific method. This impression will be confirmed and strengthened if we compare it with excerpts from medieval zoological literature dealing with related subjects." Drawing a comparison with Albertus Magnus he goes on to say, "in the realm of natural sciences he distinguishes himself more by observing and identifying than by theorizing. As against this Nazz?m is known to us mainly as a philosopher of nature and speculative theologian."78 Accordingly, to engage in the study of Einstein and Hobbes need not signify a breakaway from Muslim personality. In FORENOON OF ISLAM, A. Amin projects the ideal of a peaceful competition between Mu'tazila ("progressive party") and Muhaddithin ("conservative party"). But in a later essay he presents a rather one-sided picture of the conflict between the two "parties". Much of the appreciation he</page><page sequence="15">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-MUTAZILISM 333 earned for his FORENOON OF ISLAM was due to his ability to depict minutely the distinguishing features of the two opponents. But in this essay he is out of touch with his acuteness and incisiveness. His colour less apologetics are devoid of finer shades. He maintains, e.g., that 'the entire Western science is nothing but an invention of the Mu'tazila; had their school of thought not been extinguished the West would not be able to deck itself out in borrowed plumes; instructors of the world would be the Muslims.'79 But such superficiality is momentary, sporadic, surely not representa tive of his thought in general. It is but natural that in the eyes of an educationist so passionately absorbed by his mission as was A. Amin the achievements, however remarkable they be, always seem to fall short of his high aspirations. The noteworthy blend of patience and impa tience that has been observed by so many of his friends was in ail likeli hood the cause of his success.80 His laudable contribution to Muslim historiography is to have restored the rightful image to the intellectual performances of the Mu'tazila. But he did not stop at that. Obviously he became increasingly aware that to take up an interrupted tradition by objective historical representation alone did not suffice to confront the painful consequences in which the extirpation of the Mu'tazila had resulted: "With the acceptance of the methods of Western civilisation the Muslims began to imitate the foreigners instead of rising up on their own legs. Imitation of the foreign created inferiority complexes in them."81 To liberate his students from these inferiority complexes appeared to be a rewarding task to a teacher mentally shaped by the reform tradi tion of 'Abduh and Mustat? cAbd al-R?ziq.82 Feeling the necessity to extenuate the remoteness of his 'Abbas? mod?l'and to endow it with con crete perspicuity he set himself the task of reviving the most representative writings of Muslim rationalism and free-thought. To support his ardent defence of the Mu'tazila by presenting a splendid example he chose to bring back to life one of their most captivating representatives, the long forgotten Ab? Hayy?n al-Tawh?d?. Thus we owe to the diligent zeal of the undefatigable worker that was A. Amin excellent editions of al Tawhidi's KIT?B AL-IMT?' WA L-MUfi?NASA (three volumes 1939-44)? AL-HAW?MIL WA L-SHAW?MIL (1951), and AL BAS?'IR WA L-DHAKH?'IR (1953), Although in the KIT?B AL-HAW?MIL WA L-SHAW?MIL, which is an exchange of ques tions and answers between al-Tawh?d? and Ibn Miskawayh, the part</page><page sequence="16">334 DETLEV KHALID of the latter is more momentous both for its length and philosophical con tents, yet it was al-Tawh?d? whom A. Amin had in mind when he pub lished it. The reason is that he considered him to be one of the greatest Arab classical authors in the fields of language and literature as well as thought.83 Al-Tawh?d? was obsessed by the image of al-ins?n al-k?mil (the perfect or the 'super' man) and this accounts for the humanist angle which he applies to all important problems. To A. Amin he appeared, therefore, as most typical of an exemplary movement of acculturation with its general crisis of the self-realization of Muslims who have to arrange themselves with the forces of the day. In many respects al-Tawh?d?'s comprehensive writings signify the apex of that "p?riode h?ro?que" when Mu'tazilism reached its climax. This notwithstanding, he has failed to provide us with a synthesis of doctrines. The Mu'tazila, although agreed on the five cardinal prin ciples, did not display that unity and homogeneity one might expect from a 'school of thought', and al-Tawh?d?'s work is as far from constitu ting a summa theologica as that of any other Mu'tazilite genius. The task of bringing forward an essential summary of Islamic verities, comparable to the product of Thomas Aquinas, was left to the post-Mu'tazilite Imam al-Ghaz?l?, whose drift into mysticism was followed by the aging A. Amin. This later development signified the decline of neo-Mu'tazilism not only on a personal level but more or less on the whole. For scholars who still devote themselves to research on I'tiz?l, like Albert Nader, or M. Ab? Zahra (T?R?KH AL-MADH?HIB AL-ISL?MlYA) there seems t? be much less personal involvement beyond the purely academic interest. Once freedom of thought in Muslim lands had broken the shackles of traditionalism I'tiz?l as a tool of acculturation became less attractive. Where secularism was instituted as official or semi-official doctrine, the Mu'tazilite model lost its relevance altogether, or at least to the extent institutionalized secularism was challenged Or not. In Muslim societies that do renounce secularism and choose to tread the more strenuous, because poorly defined, path toward a genuine Islamic order Mu'tazilism will surely continue to serve as a source of inspiration until its solutions are so convincingly superseded by new ones that the old 'Abb?s? writers become truly obsolete. Before this stage is reached neo Mu'tazilism will always find a field of operation, at least in justifying freedom of thought. With this aspect in view we may even be allowed to say that the importance attached to I'tiz?l indicates absence of, or opposition to, freedom of thought in that particular Muslim society. This has been most acutely underlined by Zehd? J?r-All?h in his book AL-MU'TAZILA:</page><page sequence="17">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-MU'TAZILISM 335 "Had the reactionary forces in Europe been able to do away with the rationalist movement as the reactionaries in Islam did with the Mu'tazila, this great European civilization would not have come into being.84 For us as Sunn?s there is much in Mu'tazilism we cannot agree to ?many details of their opinions, their philosophical fallacies, their sophistical squabbles . * . But there is one thing we cannot but admire, something we have to uphold and emulate: this is their spirit... Their daringly critical, liberating spirit which loves philosophy, seeks moderation and modernization, glorifies reason, sanctifies freedom, and purifies the doctrine of unity from the dross of anthropomorphism! How much do we stand in need of this spirit, how much do we require its revivification so that new vigour and new hope may rise in us and that we may solve our many present problems with its help!"85 A similiar line of argument led A. Amin to pronounce the following verdict on the role of the theological rationalists: "In my opinion the end of the Mu'tazila was one of the greatest catastrophes for Muslims, a catastrophe which, moreover, they inflicted upon themselves."86 This assertion echoes a pioneering statement from Iqb?Ps lecture on THE SPIRIT OF MUSLIM CULTURE.87 It is indicative of the common concern of orthodox Muslim intellectuals, viz., to make their conciliatory pathway, their via media, to avert the portentous polariza tion into which the community is driven by less enlightened revivalists and radical secularists. It has repeatedly been said that the present-day constellation bears a great similarity to that of the earlier Mu'tazila. They sounded the rally for the elements of moderation when these were pressed hard by the figuratively illiterate literalists on one side and by the extreme and most advanced R?fida and Qar?mita on the other. Keeping this proposition in view the use of the name Mu'tazila by Vbroad school Muslims of India" and elsewhere proves to be far less unhistorical and misleading than Duncan B. MacDonald was prone to think.88 This is not to say that neo-Mu'tazilism lends itself to abundant definition of what the ism stands for. "Quoi qu'il en soit, les esprits qui ne se satisferont pas des solutions simplistes?retour pur et simple aux modes de vie et de pens?e de l'islam primitif ou au contraire abandon r?solu de tout 'lien' religieux pour se pr?cipiter dans l'ath?isme sp?culatif ou practique?pourront trouver dans la tentative d'harmonie men?e par les premiers th?ologiens musulmans une source d'inspiration</page><page sequence="18">33? DETLEV KH?LID pour de nouvelles synth?ses, on du moin une m?thode et un espri* les encourageant ? cette recherche."89 G. MU'TAZILISM AS A FACTOR OF INTEGRATION The supra-sectarian structure of I'tiz?l was another important element responsible for the high expectations neo-Mu'tazilism aroused in Muslim modernists. The concept of al-manzila bayna l-manzilatayn (literally: stand between the two positions) with which the Mu'tazila undertook to reconcile divergent views is appealing due to its spirit of moderation. A certain Muslim school of thought, the Murj?a, had taught that a Muslim who commits a serious crime is no doubt a sinner but remains, nevertheless, a Muslim. As against that the Khaw?rij movement regarded such criminals as apostates. Here the Mu'tazila took up an intermediary stand which, for many individuals, bridged the gulf between two extreme positions.90 Popular support for such an attitude could be gained with sayings of the Prophet like: khayru um?ri awsatuh??the best way is the middle-way. Starting with the above-mentioned example, the Mu'tazila ultimate ly succeeded in creating a system that could serve as a common plat form, if not as a base of rapprochement even between the two poles of Islam that seem to be so widely apart from each other, viz., ShVa and Khaw?rij. It is a general trend of modernism to put an end to the age old strife between Sunnis and Shi'is. Since this difference of 'sects' has its roots in political events and personality clashes of a distant past rather than in theological issues such a rapprochement appears, at, first sight, easier than that between the different Churches of Christia nity.81 In fact, it is sometimes alleged that Jam?l al-d?n al-Afgh?n? belonged to the Sh?'a. The whole career of this spearhead of Muslim renaissance shows beyond doubt, that he had divested himself of all sectarian prejudices. S. Ahmad Khan was Sunni by origin and S. Amir 'Ali was Sh?'?. As neo-Mu'tazilites they operated from a common base just as those early Mu'tazila in 'Iraq who came from both the camps and whom Louis Gardet describes as : "Tiers-parti si Ton veut, parti de la conciliation, en tout cas parti politique. Les mu'tazilites "th?ologiques" ou sp?culatifs emprunteront au vocabulaire politique cette appellation qui d?finissait assez bien leur position intellectuelle."92 A. Am?n's critical research on Sh?'ism in DAWN OF ISLAM, the first book of his historical series, proved almost fatal. In 1931 he headed an Egyptian delegation to 'Iraq where they were invited to attend, inter alia, a lecture by a Sh?'? divine who used the occasion to</page><page sequence="19">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-MU'TAZILISM 337 deliver a most inciting discourse with attacks against A. Amin. When the public fury had reached the boiling point, the delegates had quickly to be brought into safety through a backdoor. For a scholar free from any sectarianism like A. Amin this event was a painful experience.93 He rightly pointed out that in his historical studies he criticised Sunnis just as much as Sh?'?s. Still he felt the urge to give forceful expression to his objective neutrality and to do full justice to all.94 This was, more over, the demand of the spirit of his time which M. Husayn Haykal, Egypt's leading journalist and famous author of HAY?T MUHAMMAD (Biography of the Prophet) advertised as "the reconciliatory thought of Islam."95 This conception points back to the Im?m al-Ghaz?lr69 and still more closely to Sh?h Wall-Allah of Delhi who made tafb?q (in his vocabulary reconciliation) his leitmotif.91 Thus the circle takes its full round and once again we are back to Ftiz?l. The dominant tendencies of Sh?'ism are closely related to those of the Mu'tazila in practically all questions unconnected with the doctrine of the Im?m. Sh?'? theologians even adopted for themselves the denomi nation al-adliyya, a name originally used by the Mu'tazila. Many of them even claim 6All and the lm?ms as founders of the Mu'tazilite school and while reiterating the doctrines of Ftizal in their writings Sh?'? authors often attribute them to one or the other of their Imams. Especially the Zaydi branch of Sh?'ism holds on to Mu'tazilite doctrines, in greater detail and more strictly than the Imamites. Their founder, Zayd, grandson of al-Husayn Ibn , had studied under the initiator of Ftizal, W?sil Ibn 'Ata'. During the final phase of Mu'tazilism the Baghdad school became more and more merged in the Zayd?ya.93 It is the Zayd?s to whom Zehd? J?r-Allah refers when he says that the spirit of the Mu'tazila after being chased away from the soil of the Sunna found refuge in the lands of the Sh?'a where, however, it lived the life of a stranger in seclusion.99 Orientalists expect to find more material on Ftizal once the literary treasures of the Zayd?s become better accessible. The TABAQ?T AL-MU'TAZILA by one of their Im?ms, Ahmad Ibn Yahya Ibn al-Murta&lt;Ja, has been edited in 1961. Again it has to be admitted that this very Ibn al-Murta&lt;J? did not really appreciate the integrating force of Mu'tazilism. He was rather displeased because of the existence of Mu'tazila from among the Khaw?rij and the Raw?fi?l.100 Anyhow, the works of Sh?'a dogma display the principal division of Mu'tazilite writings in two parts: the first comprises chapters on the unity of G?d and the second those dealing with justice, concomitantly they describe the hidden Im?m as belonging to the group that stands for tawhtd</page><page sequence="20">338 DETLEV KHALID and 'adi?which was but one of the most common appellations of the Mu'tazila. In this context it should not be forgotten that the Basra school of the Mu'tazila was pro-'Al? (preferable to Aba Bakr); under Ma'm?n, a decidedly pro-'Ali Caliph, this school gained a preponderating influence. Together with the doctrine of the creation of the Qur'?n 'AH was pro claimed the best of creatures after Muhammad. It is certainly a somewhat casual remark when Montgomery Watt says, "with the principle of 6 adi (justice) the Mu'tazila had taken over all that was best in the thought of the Khaw?rij,"101, for neither that prin ciple was confined to any particular group in the community nor was it the only valuable contribution made by the Khaw?rij to Islamic thought. But with regard to the interaction of Khaw?rij and Mu'tazila the statement is, nevertheless, relevant insofar as it singles out the most important link: "These interpretations of current conceptions are made in accordance with the principle of 6adl, the justice or righteousness of God; in this they were the successors of the Khaw?rij. It is precise ly here that their rationalism begins to appear."102 The rationalist tendencies of the Mu'tazila, that were preserved in Shi'ism, had resulted in a certain liberalism which may account for the decisive participation of Slii'i intellectuals in the modernist movement. The most typical personification of this phenomenon was S. Amir 'Ali, during the later 'Abb?s? epoch Sh?'ism was well represented by the genius of al-Q??l? 'Abd al-Jabb?r, one of the last great theologians of I'tiz?l and author of the SHARH AL-US?L AL-KHAMSA 'INDA L-MU'TA ZILA. But Mu'tazilite rationalism, was in turn also preserved by this radical party. Due to their spirit of revolt against the establishment there arose among the Khaw?rij numerous theologians who opppsed the generally accepted dogmas of orthodoxy. They refused to accept any other legal source beside the Qur*?n and some of them even went to the extent of challenging the integrity of the Holy Book from which they wanted to exclude the chapter Joseph. In this way they continued the tradition of those Godfearing Mu'tazila who adopted a very critical attitude toward the hadith and who held similar views with regard to certain passages of the Glorious Qur'?n, passages which reflect clashes between the Prophet and his adversaries on very personal matters which are, according to those Mu'tazila, not of general relevance.103 It is the moderate branch of the Ib??l?s who kept alive the doctrine of the creation of the Qur'?n. Whereas the early Khaw?rij held most anthro pomorphic ideas, their present-day successors do not any more believe in a physical vision of God in paradise.104</page><page sequence="21">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-MU'TAZILISM 339 As the 'democrats in Islam' they were most bitterly opposed to the aristocratic concept of ahi al-bayt and the concomitant infallibility of the Imam in Shi'ism. They recognize no fundamental need of an Imam, he is only allowable, some of them held that he should only be appointed in time of public trouble. The general Sunn? view is that the appoint ment of an Imam, is incumbent upon men, according to the Sh?'?s (Im?mites, Ism?'?l?s) the appointment is incumbent upon God. The basis of obedience is in both cases tradition. Here the Mu'tazilite effort at reconcilation led to their conception that it was for man to appoint but that the necessity was based on reason, some argued that the basis was partly reason and partly obedience to tradition. The latter view was supported by the Zayd?s and gradually it found acceptance in the strongest surviving section of the Khaw?rij, the Ib??l?s. Later develop ment was probably a result of the migration of a Mu'tazilite commu nity, numbering about 30,000 members, to T?hert, a Maghribi capital of the Ib?dis.105 A. Amin had dismissed the question of the rightful ascension to the Caliphate as irrelevant to the future prospects of the community.106 For practical purposes, however, this problem calls for some sort of settle ment even today as before. heterogeneous Muslim countries Sunni Shi'l clashes are often provoked by Sh?'? disrespect for Ab? Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Uthm?n. For centuries it has been customary among the majority of Sh?'?s to condemn these venerated "rightly guided Caliphs" of early Islam. The resulting tensions render rapprochement between the two parties very difficult. The Mu'tazila provided a guide-post to the solu tion of this issue which is, so far as Sh??ism is concerned, preserved in the teachings of the Zayd?s. They do not regard the first Caliphs, Ab? Bakr and 'Umar, as usurpers as the extreme Sh?'?s do; W?sil and with him all the Mu'tazila regarded the Caliphate of Ab? Bakr as legitimate; he left undecided the question as to who had the superior claim to Caliphate: Ab? Bakr, 'Umar or 'Al?, but he accepted the superior claim of 'Ali over 'Uthm?n.107 It is exactly the position taken by Am?r 'Ali who ex pressed his high esteem for Ab? Bakr and 'Umar on many occasions: "Osman possessed neither the shrewdness of Abu Bakr nor the intellectual vigour or the moral fibre of Omar. His amiability and easy good-nature made him a pliable tool in the hands of his kinsfolk."108 The progressive evaluation of 'Ali by the Mu'tazila has already been alluded to. According to A. Amin, this concession to Sh?'ism emanated from the desire to achieve sectarian harmony and from a genuine admiration for the man whose destiny is inextricably linked with</page><page sequence="22">340 DETLEV KHALID that of the Holy Prophet.109 Therefore, he is venerated and loved not only by Sh?'?s but by Sunn?s as well. Nevertheless, resumption of the Mu'tazilite procedure to overcome sectarian strife meant, on the one hand, recognition of Abu Bakr and 'Umar by the Sh?'?s, and, on the other, a renewed emphasis on the exemplary role and character of 'Ali by the Sunn?s. Iqb?l reconstructed religious thought on lines largely different from those of the neo-Mu'tazilites who preceded him. For integrating the two parties, however, he adhered to the tradition of I'tiz?l: "Iqb?l was not only an ardent lover of the Prophet himself but also of his family and especially of his cousin and son-in-law , the fourth caliph who has become, in Islamic traditions, one of the most important and pathetic figures though he was, historically seen, not very clever in his political affairs... The meaning of thfe different names with which he is called ? Haydar the lion* Murtad?, Karr?r, etc.?are set forth in the ioth chapter of the Asr?r, and in Iqb?l's poetry the name 'Ali or Haydar becomes the cipher for that spiritual poverty which strengthens human persona lity; Haydar is the fighter against the unbelievers of Khaybar and becomes a model of the Perfect Man."110 Simultaneously, however, Iqb?l dubbed the concept of Mahdism as entirely un-Islamic. In fact he envisages the SPIRIT OF MUSLIM CULTURE as a spirit of revolt against the Messianic-idea, which is an indispensable pillar of Shi'ism. Refuting Spengler's classification of Islam in THE DECLINE OF THE WEST Iqb?l wrote: "In this connexion Spengler fails to appreciate the cultural value of the idea of the finality of Prophethood in Islam. No doubt, one important feature of magian culture is a perpetual attitude of expectation, a constant looking forward to the coming of Zoroaster's unborn sons, the Messiah, or the Paraclete of the fourth gospel. . . Ibn Khald?n, seeing the spirit of his own view of history, has fully criticised and, I believe, finally demolished the alleged revelational basis in Islam of an idea similar, at least in its psychological effects, to the original magian idea which had reappeared in Islam under the pressure of magian thought."111 Following his line of argument A. Amin elaborated this anti Mahdfem still further in his booklet AL-MAHD?Y WA L-MAHDA WlYA. The question of the Caliphate or Imamate as such is not solved by merely reshuffling the order of precedence. The assignment of a new status to 'Umar and 'Ali constitutes only one part of the deal. But the second part, the question of the system of government, was one of those</page><page sequence="23">SOME ASPECTS OF NEO-t?U'TAZILISM 341 issues on which there was least unanimity among the Muctazila. This enabled their modern successors to imbibe more or less whole-heartedly the ideas of Western democracy, or, with regard to the Khil?fa to follow the lead given by the Khaw?rij. A. Amin adhered to the stand taken by the Khaw?rij and used their famous slogan wa law k?na 'abdan fyabashiyan in his criticism of Shi'i doctrine: "Most entitled to rule is the most competent one, even if he be a Negro slave; there is no difference between the progeny of the Holy Prophet and the son of a carpenter or a hair-cutter.5'112) He refers to a section of the Mu'tazila who, under the impact of the Khaw?rij, had rejected the condition o? Qurashi descent for the post of the Caliph.lla It is for this significant revival of Kh?rij? thought that we have paid special attention to the correlation of this minor school with Mu'tazilism. The rationalism of I'tiz?l brought extremely divergent groups together on a number of vital points. But simultaneously the influx of unresolvable divergencies of Sh?c? and Kh?rij? conceptions severely limited the integrating potentialities which Mu'tazilism could offer had its intellectual absorption remained confined to the major schools of Sunni Islam. In other words: Mu'tazilite rationalism appeared very promising in eliminating sectarian differences originating in historical rivalries, be cause of the applicability of reason. But this very rationalism compli cates integration when it enters the realm of mystery where reason is not applicable. Thus even as an integrating force the distinctive asset of Mu'tazilism is a principal obstacle : the affirmation of reason in one sphere seemingly creates an obligation which renders difficult its restriction in other spheres where it is not to be applied. This aspect, however, re quires a more elaborate and separate discussion. We may be allowed to close the present chapter with a prayer that expresses, no doubt, a general aspiration of Muslims, but which is, nevertheless, characteristic of the particular emphasis given to it by neo-Mu'tazilism. A. Amin concludes the foreword of his last book, the NOON OF ISLAM (published pos thumously in 1955) with the words: "May God . . . restore to Muslims their unity, may He bring their opposing schools of thought together !

The use of the term sect for such Islamic groups or movements like the JfChaw?rij is disputaple because most schisms stem from political rather than theologica rifts. To call I'tiz?l a sect is in my opinion particularly inappropriate, the reason will become apparent in the course of this article. Nevertheless, it has become quite a fashion to deal with the Mu'tazila as one of the sects of Islam, cf. e.g. Les Sectes Principales de l'Islam by Albert Nader (Bayr?t 1958) or Tarij?. al-Firaq al Isl?miya wa Nash?t 'Ilm-al-Kal?m Hnda UMuslim?n by ?AB Mustaf? al-Ghur?b?

MaDonald writes : "In 234, the second year of al-Mutawakkil, it was abolished and the Qur'?n declared uncreated. At the same time the 'Alids and all Persian nationalism came under a ban. Practically, the status quo ante was restored and Mu'tazilism was again left a struggling heresy. The Arab party and the pure faith of Muhammad had re-asserted themselves."

Der Islam verf?ge, ohne Nach?fferei der europ?ischen Kultur, ?ber die geistigen Mittel, sich zu verj?ngen und mit jeder anderen Religion in Konkurrenz zu treten. Freilich sch?pften sie dies Bewu Btsein wieder zumeist aus Erfahrungen, die ihnen ihr europ?ischer Verkehr . bot, dem sie sich in ausgiebiger Weise hingaben. Bekannt ist die seiner Zeit (1883) viel bemerkte Polemik Dschemal al-din's mit Ernest Renan in den Spalten des Journal des D?bats, Sie hatte von Seiten des ersteren eine Ehrenrettung des Islam und seiner Kulturfahigkeit gegen die gegenteilige ?berzeugung des franz?sischen Akademikers zum Zweck."

Mazyad : Ahmad Amin?Advocate of Social and Literary Reform in Egypt (Leiden 1963), p. 28 : "A painful sight to Amin in 'Iraq was the division and strife between Sunnis and SkVis, the two great sects in Islam. In his autobiography he wrote about what he saw : 'The difference between the Shi'Is and Sunnis does not call for strife anymore than does the difference between the various schools of jurisprud ence. It was the narrow-mindedness and the vested interests of some of the religious leaders which created" contention, misled the people and coloured politics with religion... I put the blame for the appearance of this rift on the learned Sh?'?s. They are virtuous and could dispose of these problems with a word if they wished, and I do not understand why they do not so.' {ffaySAl 1958 edition, pp. 262-3). Before this visit to 'Ir?q, Amin had already enraged the SkHs with his criticism of their sect in Fajr al~Isl?m. This had provoked an angry reply from their leader Muhammad alflusayn al-K?shif al-Ghit?' in his book on the Origines of Shi'ism and its Bases (Asl al~?hp? wa Us?luk?, B?yr?t 1930). He said that Amin had based his chapter on the Sh?'is upon the books of their opponents, the Sunnis. Later Amin again, and more elaborately, criticised their sect in his Dui^? l-Isl?m, basing his comments on their own books. However, it must be said in fairness that Amin had also with impartiality attacked the principles of the Sunnis in Fajr ai-Islam and Duft? l-Isl?m and angered some of their members too.
