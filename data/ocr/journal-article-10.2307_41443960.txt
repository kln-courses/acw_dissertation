<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HEBREW COLLECTION OF THE BERLIN STATE LIBRARY Petra Figeac* The Berlin State Library - Prussian Cultural Heritage {Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz) holds one of the most important collections of Hebraica in Germany, on par with the collections in Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt am Main. The Hebrew material of the Berlin State Library is under the responsibility of the Oriental Department, which was founded in 1919 as a separate department of the Preussische Staatsbibliothek. Its first director was the librarian and orientalist Gotthold Weil (1882-1960), after his emigration in 1933 the director of the Jewish National Library in Jerusalem.1 The responsibility of this department includes to this day the acquisition and cataloguing of printed materials as well as manuscripts. The collection of printed rabbinical books, which was at the end of the nineteenth century one of the most important in Germany, must be considered as lost since the Second World War.2 This collection was influenced and mainly catalogued by the famous researcher and bibliographer Moritz Steinschneider (1816-1907), who compiled a very useful subject-catalogue of the printed collection. This precious catalogue survived the war and is still used as an instrument to rebuild the collection, as an important bibliographic tool for rabbinica, too. Unlike the printed collection, the Hebrew manuscripts survived the war. The librarian in charge at the time, Max Weisweiler, decided to send all manuscripts west for safekeeping, rather than east to Silesia. Most of the manuscripts survived in the Abbey of Banz and the Abbey of Beuron, and were moved after the war to Tübingen University Library, where they formed the ' Tübinger Depot der Preussischen Staatsbibliothek '. After the war a new Oriental department was founded - first in Marburg - and then in West-Berlin, where in 1968 the new building of the Berlin State Library was opened. A small group of manuscripts remained in Berlin during the war for several reasons, for example the so-called Hebrew 'Erfurt Bible' could not be moved because of its size and weight. After the war this important manuscript was part of the Oriental manuscript holdings of the Deutsche Staatsbibliothek in East-Berlin.3 * Petra Figeac is Curator for Hebrew and Christian Manuscripts of the Near East (Oriental Department - Berlin State Library) European Judaism Volume 4 1 , Number 2, Autumn 2008 : 25-29 doi: 10.3 1 67/ej .2008.410205 ISSN 0014-3006 (Print), ISSN 1752-2323 (Online)</page><page sequence="2">The Hebrew Collection of the Berlin State Library In 1991, only one year after the German reunification, the two Berlin collections of Oriental manuscripts were reunited in the Scharoun-building at Potsdamer Platz. Today the collection of Hebrew manuscripts contains about 500 volumes, which is quantitatively little, but of an exceptional quality, due, among other things, to the work of Moritz Steinschneider, its first cataloguer. Donations to the Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm (1620-1688) The collection of Hebrew manuscripts dates from the very foundation of the library. An example of the original collection is the so-called ' Rösel-BibeV (thirteenth century). This very impressive ashkenazy four-tome Bible manuscript with micrography contains Targum and Masora.4 Further manuscripts include a codex of the Sefer Halachot of Alfasi, a typical Halacha-m&amp;miscr'vpi (fourteenth century)5 and the Amude golah of Isaak de Corbeil ben Joseph.6 As we know from the dedications to the Great Elector (1620-1688), three highly interesting pergament rolls are also part of the original collection: an Esther Scroll for synagogue use, a tree with Sefirot and finally an ornamented graphical representation of Hebrew grammar.7 In the eighteenth century little was collected, such that around 1800 the royal library owned only 36 volumes of Hebrew manuscripts. It was only at the end of the nineteenth century that the Hebraica grew significantly: five different origins stand out markedly: The Shapira-manuscripts of Yemen In 1888 the then Royal Library purchased the manuscripts from the estate of Moses Wilhelm Shapira (1830-1884) who, in 1873 and 1877, had sold to the library some manuscripts. Of particular importance is a leather Tora-scroll,8 the translation of the Pentateuch of Saadja Gaon,9 a Yemenite sixteenth-century Maimonides manuscript (Sefer Mitzwot),10 and a Yemenite poetry anthology including unedited poems of Schalom Schabasi and other poets.11 The Erfurt Manuscripts Among the fifteen manuscripts from Erfurt the Giant-bible 'Erfurt 1' in two volumes literally stands out, one of the largest known Hebrew pergament 26 European Judaism Volume 41 No. 2 Autumn '08</page><page sequence="3">Petra Figeac manuscripts ever. Completed in 1343, each volume weighs 50 kg and is 47 cm by 63 cm large.12 Not to forget a very old and well-preserved ashkenazy Torah-scroll,13 two Rashi-codici14 and finally the famous Berlin Tosefta, the most complete and oldest manuscript of this text in the world. It is dated around 1 100.15 The Pinner-Library The library acquired in 1880 the legacy of the Berlin Talmud scholar Ephraim Moses Pinner. Comprising over 3,000 volumes, its 23 manuscripts also contain Halacha and Haskala ones; even composer Meyerbeer's Yiddish birthday poem for his mother, Amalie Beer. The Hamilton Collection The library is the owner of the Hamilton-Siddur , one of its most famous manuscripts.16 This Spanish thirteenth/fourteenth-century codex is famed for its unique illustrations with zoological and anthropomorphic motives. This collection was acquired from Alexander Douglas Duke of Hamilton (1767-1852) in 1883.

However, through targeted purchasing in the antique book trade in the first quarter of the twentieth century, the collection continued to grow on a regular basis. After the death of Steinschneider in 1907 this purchasing policy was primarily the work of Arthur Spanier ( 1 889- 1 945). 1 8 During this period a significant number of cabbalistic works were added to the collection. Today the library possesses about thirty cabbala manuscripts, most of them still not catalogued.19 Part of the collection is described in Moritz Steinschneiders catalogues of 1878 and 1897.20 Acquisitions thereafter are registered provisionally in an unpublished catalogue manuscript drafted by Ernst Roth und urgently in need of updating. The collection still remains to be, by and large, scientifically analysed and classified. This is our urgent wish for the future, thus doing it justice. Notes 1 .
