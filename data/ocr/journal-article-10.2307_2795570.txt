Liverpool (U.P.), 1956. Pp. xiv, 8o, plates, line drawings, maps. Price Xi I2s. 6d. In this monograph the authors describe their joint excavation of the chamber tomb of Barclodiad y Gawres, in Anglesey. The first half of the work is devoted to a detailed description of the digging, helped by a lavish series of half-tone illustrations and good line drawings. This section begins with an explanation of the geo- graphical and geological position of the monument and of its early history and ends with a description of the important series of carv- ings on five of the stones in the chamber and passage. There are five appendices dealing exhaustively with the small finds, the crema- tions, a trial excavation at the neighbouring tumulus called Mynydd Bach, a description of the Calderstones, Liverpool and a note on the derivation and meaning of the name Barclodiad y Gawres. There is also an index. The main part of the monograph is devoted to discussions of the structure and evidence for rituals found at the site, and of the fine new series of carvings. Barclodiad y Gawres is fitted carefully into its place in the series of tombs of this type in Western Europe; we see it as an outlying and a fairly early example of the Cruciform Passage Graves of the Boyne, complete with elaborate mural art. The excavations of stone-built tombs are difficult to describe clearly, particularly their structural details. The authors have suc- ceeded very well, perhaps because they refer constantly to a good selection of plans, sectiolns and photographs. The latter, it is true, vary in quality; for the most part, however, they add considerably to the reader's understanding of the architecture of this megalithic structure. So little is known of the ritual connected with burial in this type of Passage Grave that the discoveries at Barclodiad y Gawres, though meagre, are of much importance. The recess in the passage containing an upright stone pillar with an oyster shell offering at its foot, the remains of a hearth and ritual stew in the central chamber, confinement of burials, by cremation, to the side- chambers and the elaborate blocking of one of the latter-these details add greatly to what we knew before of burial rites in the Boyne Culture. The mural art found pecked into the surfaces of five of the stones (at the inner end of the passage and on two side-chamber stones) is described in some detail and an attempt is made to assess its position in the mural and plaque-idol art of Iberia, Western France and Ireland. At Barclodiad y Gawres the range of motifs includes both anthropomorphic designs and a superbly executed group of spirals. The authors conclude that stylistically the mural art found in this tomb should belong to an early phase of the art of the Boyne Culture. If criticism can be found, it is perhaps in the publication of an excavation report-albeit an elaborate one-on its own, in a country where archxeological literature is already notoriously diffuse. Could it not have appeared in a volume of Archwologia? This, however, is not an important point. NICHOLAS THOMAS</page></plain_text>
