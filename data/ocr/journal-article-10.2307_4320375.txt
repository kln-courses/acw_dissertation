<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID HILBERT COMMENTS ON "ANTHROPOMORPHISM" (Received 23 July, 1992) To an outsider there is something peculiar in the debate over the appropriateness of attributing mental states to non-human animals. To deny that dogs and cats experience fear and hunger, not to mention pleasure and pain, seems absurd. There may be some puzzling cases, say fish or turtles to take some common pets, but there are many cases where the correctness of such attributions seems beyond doubt. The description of the supposed mistake as one of anthropomorphism also seems peculiar to the outsider. According to one dictionary I consulted, anthropomorphism is the attribution of a human personality to some- thing that is not human. There very well may be people who attribute full human personality to their pets but this is commonly regarded as being a mistake and somewhat eccentric as well. What I suspect most pet owners attribute to their pets is something like a dog personality or a cat personality where there may be attributes that the mental lives of dogs and cats have in common with human beings but differences as well. It may be that, as a another dictionary has it, anthropomorphism is the attribution of human characteristics to non-human things but then the charge of anthropomorphism cannot bring with it the automatic implication that some kind of mistake is being made. Attributing human characteristics to non-human animals is only a mistake if those animals lack those characteristics and there are surely a number of properties that human beings have in common with some other animals. Conse- quently the claim that an attribution of mental states to a non-human animal is anthropomorphic does not entail that the attribution is in error and does not explain why the attribution is mistaken if it is. Professor Stebbins' paper exhibits neither of these oddities. She argues, in a very interesting way, that at least some attributions of mental states to non-human animals are correct and that this is con- sistent with their being anthropomorphic in a clearly defined sense.

The heart of her account is that human beings (and other animals as well) have instinctual re- sponses to the behavior of conspecifics that mediate coordinated behavior. We attribute mental states to other human beings partly on the basis of noticing our own responses to their behavior and partly on the basis of inferences from these instinctually mediated basic attribu- tions. Although the mechanisms that produce these responses pre- sumably evolved to facilitate intraspecific coordination of behavior they can be triggered by the behavior of members of other species as well. This is an interesting and plausible account of an important route to the attribution of mental states to other animals. The crucial question remains, however, is there reason to trust these attributions? Professor Stebbins maintains that the degree of continuity between humans and other animals makes it plausible to claim that the content attributions produced as a result of the operation of these processes are generally accurate. This claim is surely correct in the case of other primates and to a lesser extent with regard to other mammals. But, to take a case mentioned in the paper, birds are not particularly similar to human beings and the most recent common ancestor of birds and human beings is in the rather distant past. The relevant differences between birds and human beings include patterns of behavior and the neurologi- cal structures and processes that give rise to them. To take an example to which I will return, although the peripheral neuro-anatomy of birds is similar in some respects to that of human beings there are very substantial differences with regard to more central aspects.1 Professor Stebbins also offers as support for the appropriateness of instinctually mediated mental state attributions the claim that humans and other species have evolved from common ancestors in response to the same environmental pressures. Although it is certainly true that birds and human beings have evolved from the same primitive ances- tors, the sense in which their evolution has been in response to the same environmental pressures is not at all clear in any very determinate sense. And even if the environmental pressures are the same, this would not ensure that the response to these pressures would be similar. What is at issue, of course, is not whether birds and human beings are similar</page><page sequence="3">COMMENTS ON "ANTHROPOMORPHISM" 125 or different since in different respects they are both. What we need to know is whether birds are similar in respect of occupying mental states similar to the ones human beings would occupy if similarly situated and displaying apparently similar behavioral dispositions. In the absence of any very detailed understanding of the relations betwen either neuro- physiology and mental states, or behavior and mental states this ques- tion is not answerable. A concrete example of the kinds of differences between human beings and many other animals that may be relevant here can be found in the neuro-biology of the visual system. In humans, and other pri- mates, the primary projection from the retinal ganglion cells is to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and from there to the striate cortex. A much smaller projection goes to the colliculus and other non- cortical areas. Although birds have no neo-cortex, and consequently no visual cortex, and no colliculus the analogous areas are the forebrain and the optic tectum. The relative importance of the projections from the retina to these areas is reversed in birds from what it is human beings, with a much heavier projection to the tectum than to the forebrain. The connection of these anatomical facts with our problem is via the phenomenon of blindsight. It has been known for some time that in monkeys significant visual capacity remains even in the total absence of striate cortex. In human beings damage to the geniculo-striate pathway can give rise to the phenomenon known as blindsight.2 A patient with blindsight will deny that they receive any visual input in the affected area of their visual field. Nevertheless if asked to guess as to the presence or absence of a stimulus presented in the blind field they can display quite impressive accuracy. It seems clear that the pathways other than the geniculo- striate pathway can support significant visual function which is capable of guiding some kinds of behavior. The number of stimulus attributes that blindsight patients are capable of responding to is surprisingly large and seems to include at least color, shape, and motion. These discrimi- nations are accompanied by a firm denial of any visual awareness of stimuli presented in the blink field. This set of phenomena is relevant to our question because it suggests that similar behavioral capacities could be mediated by very different kinds of mechanisms and mechanisms that seem to differ in the kinds of</page><page sequence="4">126 DAVID HILBERT mental states associated with them. If we were to adopt a naive inter- pretation of the anatomical difference between birds and human beings we would be led to the conclusion that for birds, and many other animals, their analog of human visual awareness does not play the important role in mediating their visually guided behavior that it plays in human beings. On this interpretation, blindsight is the normal condi- tion for a bird. I do not wish to push this interpretation but merely to raise doubts about whether partial behavioral similarities necessarily reflect similarities in mental states, especially in the case of animals whose behavior and biology is as different from ours as that of birds. One argument for the correctness of attributions of mental states that Professor Stebbins does not give is an argument from the fact that they allow successful prediction of various aspects of animal behavior. I suspect, however, that this consideration is important in allowing the instinctual mechanisms she discusses to have the epistemic effects that they do. Another question that cases like blindsight raise is whether successful prediction of behavior really requires correctness in the attributions of mental states. An uninformed observer watching a blindsight patient undergoing psycho-physical testing would be likely to attribute to the patient normal visual awareness and could with some accuracy predict their responses partly on the basis of this attribution.3 This example is of course far removed from the attributing of a desire to eat to a dog but I think raises an important question about just how similar we are to the animals we interact with. It may be that our instinctually mediated attributions of mental states to other animals successfully allows us to predict some of their behavior without accu- rately reflecting the mechanisms that causally result in that behavior or the totality of behavioral dispositions that those mechanisms produce. I do not wish to be taken as denying the existence of animal minds or that some animals in some situations are accurately described using the same mentalistic vocabulary that we use for describing other human beings. I especially do not wish to be taken as denying the interest and importance of the processes underlying attribution of mental states to other animals that Professor Stebbins describes. What I do wish to argue for, however, is a certain amount of skepticism about whether we are often in a position to accurately attribute mental states to animals from other species. The larger the differences in behavior and physi-</page><page sequence="5">COMMENTS ON "ANTHROPOMORPHISM" 127 ology between another species and human beings the more skeptical we should be about the appropriateness of treating those organisms as mentally similar to human beings. It very well may be the case that we should allow that birds have minds. If they do, however, they may be very different from ours and we are not in a position to know very much about the nature and extent of those differences. NOTES 1 I owe this point and most of the other information about avian neuro-biology that follows to Ralph Adolphs who has given me the benefit of his neuro-biological knowledge in the course of many conversations on this and other topics. 2 For an extended case study with interesting discussion see L. Weiskrantz, Blindsight: A Case Study and Implications (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986). For the neuro-biology see A. Cowey and P. Stoerig, "The neuro-biology of blindsight," Trends in Neurosciences 14 (1991): 140-145. 3 They would also be in danger of making some incorrect predictions. For example, an observer might expect that the patient could identify and respond appropriately to the stimulus as opposed to merely detecting it and its location.
