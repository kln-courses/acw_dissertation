<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROUST'S BLANK PAGE The importance of metaphor in Proust's own style as well as in the aesthetic theory enunciated in A la recherche du temps perdu1 is well-known. As the author explains in Le Temps retrouve, his focus on metaphor is a consequence of his realization that language should express his feelings rather than attempt to represent the world. This adoption of metaphor is a turning-point for the narrator, who had previously supposed that there was some intrinsic truth to objective reality. Only when the narrator/protagonist recognizes the fundamental emptiness and meaninglessness of external reality, and admits that there is nothing in it to be captured in realistic, 'cinematographic' language, and that the richness of reality is to be found in the artist's necessarily affective formulation of his relationship with a reality of little intrinsic significance, can he focus on metaphor, the stylistic feature which exploits this anthropocentric relationship by deliberately substituting a personal projection for the external reality which outwardly elicited the metaphor.2 The narrator and Swann seem at first to be drawn towards the hidden meaning of life through a series of artistic explorations. But this promise is soon disappointed- Bergotte's explanations, La Berma's first performance, Swann's monograph on Vermeer, seem to be counter-productive, seem to further reduce the power of the works of art concerned, seem to diminish their significance, let alone that of the reality they were to illuminate. Ultimately, however, the work of art itself does operate metaphorically - hence Proust's description ofElstir's transposition of sea and land as a metaphorical process (I, 835-36) - but this metaphorical transposi- tion of reality leads to a pre-intellectual reality, as perceived by the Swann who internalizes the Vinteuil sonata, rather than the analytical reality sought by Swann in his study of Vermeer.3 When we turn to A la recherche as a whole and map this intuition on to the metaphorical forms of the book itself we must remember the dual function of Proust's text. It is a work of art (obviously), but a work of art presented as such by its own protagonist, who, at the end of A la recherche, announces the impending creation of a work which must be very close to the one that we have read. Hence the importance of the dual 'steeples' passages we shall discuss, with their embedding of a naively artistic passage (as we shall show) within an artfully neutral one. This mise en abyme is a paradigm of the stylistic tensions of the whole novel. As a work of art, the 1 All references to A la recherche du temps perdu are to the Pleiade edition, edited by P. Clarac and A. Ferre, 3 vols (Paris, I954), with the volume number in roman and the page number in arabic numerals. 2 . M. Cocking recalls Proust's appreciation of Anna de Noailles, where the resurrection of personal feeling is preferred to incidental reality, but where even this emotional resurrection is inferior to the power of knowingly fabricated metaphor: 'metaphores qui recomposent et nous rendent le mensonge de notre premiere impression. ... Mais ces charmantes et toutes vives comparaisons qui substituent a la constatation de ce qui est, la resurrection de ce que nous avons senti (la seule realite interessante), disparaissent elles-memes a c6te d'images vraiment sublimes, toutes criees' (J. M. Cocking, Proust: Collected Essays on the Writer and his Art (Cambridge, I982), pp. I50-5I), quoting Proust's article on Les Eblouissements, which is to be found in Marcel Proust, Contre Sainte-Beuve, precede de Pastiches et Melanges et suivi de Essais et Articles, edited by P.

D. WHITELEY 571 novel should be laced with metaphor, the stylistic emblem of its success. But as a search, it should echo the protagonist's ingenuous journey towards enlightenment.4 The dilemma is in fact relieved by the posture of the narrator, writing from an enlightened viewpoint but disguising his insight. We want here to look at a case of particular focus on metaphor in A la recherche, in a passage which is incidentally a mise en abyme of the whole text's dual function. The metaphorical mirroring of the dual textual function will assume a particular importance. This special case is the notorious passage describing the three steeples (i, 179-82) -representing the only moment in the book when the protagonist becomes specifically and absolutely the artist. Here the text, albeit only for a page, is for once to be read as a work of art in the absolute: it was written as art by the protagonist, it is transcribed virtually verbatim and presented as art by the narrator, and it is intended by Proust himself to be artistic - although perhaps in parodic, third- degree form. We do not intend to point out all the niceties distinguishing Proust's real work offiction (the article based on a conflation of his motor excursions through Normandy with Agostinelli, and published in Pastiches et Melanges) from the pro- tagonist'sfictitious piece of real writing, although there would be fun enough to be had in analysing Proust's fake documentary, and although Proust makes an artistic use of this piece of banalized art by making the article, which really appeared in the Figaro of 19 November 1907 as 'Impressions de route en automobile', figure as the narrator's own first attempt at publication ... in the Figaro. What interests us here is the status of the passage in its context and, indeed, the relationship of this passage with the text surrounding or embedding it. Given the perfect equivocation of its textual function, A la recherche should be suffused with disingenuous metaphor. But this particular passage (which 'succeeds', and exorcizes, because it is metaphorical, yet must simultaneously fail to achieve its avowed aim of uncovering for the protagonist the secret of reality, and fail to reveal to its writer - at the time of writing - the cause of its exorcistic power) has to stand out therefore as a passage which 'works', through metaphor, without revealing too self-consciously the metaphorical springs of its art. And yet again, the passage has to stand out from what should be a context of failure, which in its turn must not be actually devoid of whatever devices are needed to make the passage function with the metaphorical power that pervades the whole of the final text, of which it is an integral part. A la recherche as a whole, therefore, raises the question of containing an ironic narrative voice within a metaphorical structure, the whole following a mental progression from ignorance to awareness. The reason that we want to focus on the 'steeples' passages is that they throw the problem into high relief, juxtapose the planes of artless quest and artistic formulation in two alternative forms as nowhere else in the book. We shall refer first of all to the 'artistic' passage (henceforth AP), the passage quoted by Proust as having been written by his younger protagonist, from 'Seuls, s'elevant du niveau de la plaine' to 's'effacer dans la nuit' (i, 181-82). The passage itself is 'signalled' as artistic by an unusual concentration of metaphor (unusual in that Proust's metaphors usually invest a certain textual field, 4 In fact Proust does appear to try to echo the protagonist's progress towards metaphorical insight, for instance in the flamboyant metaphorical transformations Marcel operates on the 'seascapes' he sees from his Balbec bedroom (I, 672-74; 802-806).</page><page sequence="3">572 Proust's Blank Page and develop into a quasi-crystalline, complex structure, whereas we are here in the presence of a veritable series of metaphors, a string of provisional substitutions, each inconsequentially yielding to the next).5 The steeples are seen as birds,6 trees,7 compass needles,8 flowers, and girls. This metaphor-laden passage, in addition to the ostentatious seriality which signals it as artefact, draws attention to its artistic status by a concentration of self- reflexive techniques. The steeples are systematically animated, whether as steeples or as their metaphorical avatars. This animism is so aggressive as to suffuse the text with a powerful sense of the autonomous and dynamic intentionality of the steeples, and is so overdetermined that it spills over to affect the carriage and the village itself,9 although it is most spectacularly the steeples which dominate and organize the whole passage. To quote a few of many examples of animism, the steeples are initially seen 's'elevant du niveau de la plaine et comme perdus en rase campagne'; 'le clocher de Vieuxvicq s'ecarta, prit ses distances'; 'la voiture nous deposa a leurs pieds'; 'le village apres nous avoir accompagnes quelques secondes avait disparu'; finally Marcel sees the steeples 'timidement chercher leur chemin ... se serrer les uns contre les autres, glisser l'un derriere l'autre' (I, I81-82, our italics). Proust unites the various appearances of the steeples beyond their accidental metaphorical disguises, and provides a blatant model of the way that the protagonist understands the nature of reality, by attributing independent motivation to it. Thus the 'prelogical' vision of the mobile spindle or needle in fact perfectly translates the relativistic motivation imposed by 5J. Milly in his seminar has claimed that the passage is a 'tissue' of metaphors, but interestingly admits that they appear to be unmotivated, in so far as the text is a practical illustration, for Milly, of Proust's aesthetic of metaphor, a 'demonstration dans le r6cit de la genese miraculeuse de la m6taphore' (noted by J. D. Whiteley, 2 April I98I). In our view, the 'artistic' steeples passage displays a centripetal series of metaphors, univocally recalling the tenor by turns, as opposed to Proust's more mature practice of creating a centrifugal cluster. Even Proust's own immature style (as opposed to this putative example of Marcel's) shows such a tendency towards the self-generating conceit: consider, for instance, 'Un Dimanche au conservatoire', published in 895 (CSB, 367-72). The general 'ivresse' of the audience leads to the author feeling his heart beat so fast that he feels as active as a sailor-boy climbing a ship's rigging; the listeners' hearts are then compared to the single sail of a boat swollen by 'les milles bouches du vent'; these 'bouches' in turn lead to comparison with 'Satyres' and 'Thyades' at a Bacchic festival: the musicians 'semblaient. . . suspendre leurs levres a des flites comme a des grappes d'ou d6coule la melodie' in an image which returns to the origin of the metaphorical description (the music) and to the major metaphor which governs the passage ('ivresse') (CSB, 369-7I). 6 Although their appearance as birds, at least, may be heralded by the verbs 's'elevaient' and 'montaient', this series of metaphors is in contradiction with Proust's general practice of developing a central metaphor and extending it gradually. As Leo Spitzer says, 'Quelle lenteur, quelle circonspection chez Proust, dans l'introduction d'une image; il la mene par degr6s a son 6panouissement supreme' ('Le Style de Marcel Proust', in Etudes de style, translated by A. Coulon (Paris, I970), pp. 397-473 (p. 467) ). 'Ses clochers et celui de Vieuxvicq agitaient en signe d'adieu leurs cimes ensoleillees' (I, 8I ). 8 Although Proust's word 'pivot' is literally the pivot or spindle around which scales or a compass needle swivel, the vision of the vertical shafts of light veering diagonally away from the road clearly derives its figurative power from the vision of a compass needle holding to North as the compass itself turns (since the context of navigating across unfamiliar territory obviously selects the compass rather than the scales from the possible semantic foci of'pivot'). 9 So that, arriving suddenly at the base of the church, the narrator avoids the natural, unmarked metaphor 'a leur pied' (which Proust used in the Figaro original (CSB, p. 65)), and selects the surprising plural 'a leurs pieds' (i, I8I), which ostentatiously links the metaphorical birds' or girls' feet with the church.</page><page sequence="4">PETER COLLIER AND J. D. WHITELEY 573 the narrator, as the passage transfers movement away from the observer-narrator, who appears to be frozen at the centre of the action.10 The artistic nature of the vision is further underscored by the way that the metaphors refer, as often in Proust, to the realm of art rather than nature - the flowers are 'trois fleurs peintes' and the girls are 'trois filles d'une legende' (I, 182, our italics), that is, they refer to a subjectively recomposed world, inaccessible to the steeples, controlled by the artist, and not part of some autonomous metaphorical chain."1 Furthermore, the final avatar of the steeples, their metamorphosis as these mythical maidens, dissolves into a self-consciously aesthetic tableau: Marcel sees them 'ne plus faire sur le ciel encore rose qu'une seule forme noire, charmante et resignee, et s'effacer dans la nuit' (I, 182). The equivocal word 'forme', and the self- reflexive dissolution of this form coinciding with the closure of the text, again underline the artistic nature of the vision. The artist's own (re)vision is emphasized independently of this, by the way he signals the metaphorical process of writing: 'Ils me faisaient penser aussi aux trois jeunes filles . . .' (i, I82, our italics).12 Jean Milly13 has noted the rhetorical repetition of 'trois' and the more general rhetorical effect achieved by patterns of sound and rhythm in the passage (note for instance the distribution of 's', '1', 'v', and 'p' in the first phrase of AP: 'Seuls, s'elevant du niveau de la plaine et comme perdus en rase campagne, montaient vers le ciel les deux clochers de Martinville' (I, I 8)). However, it is probably the syntax of the passage which is more immediately perceived as rhetorical, with the ostenta- tious inversion and suspension of the above sentence, or, for example, of the following: Mais, un peu plus tard, comme nous 6tions d6ej pres de Combray, le soleil 6tant maintenant couch, je les apercus une derniere fois de tres loin, qui n'etaient plus que comme trois fleurs peintes ... (I, 182) Thus the whole text is heavily marked, not to say overdetermined, as artistic.14 But then one can obviously argue that much of this might apply to the novel as a whole. In this particular example, however, what is striking is the demarcation of the surrounding textual space as non-artistic. We shall refer to the passage beginning 10 This motivation, which E. Seilliere felicitously calls 'prelogique' (in his Marcel Proust (Paris, 1931), p. 265), is also claimed by Proust as a deliberate strategy, nominally of Flaubert, but obviously of himself as well: 'Les choses ont autant de vie que les hommes, car c'est le raisonnement qui apres [coup] assigne a tout ph6nomene visuel des causes exterieures, mais dans l'impression premiere que nous recevons cette cause n'est pas impliqu6e' (CSB, pp. 588-89). 11 Even the birds seem to be perceived as posing like an artist's model or still-life: 'comme trois oiseaux posis sur la plaine' (I, 181, our italics). 12 The 'aussi' also underlines the effort towards seriality. An early version of the 'n6nufar' description in 'Combray' (I, 168-69) uses a similar phrase in describing the variety of images suggested by the lily-leaf: 'Elle me faisait penser aux choses les plus vari6es . .' (cahier 4, 32r?). Proust's subsequent revisions show an effort - characteristic of his stylistic reworkings - to interlink the images and thereby to avoid the impression of disparity or seriality. In this way AP can be seen as an un-rewritten passage, as well as one un-written by the surrounding, 'blank' passage, as we shall demonstrate. 13 In La Phrase de Proust (Paris, 1975), p. 136. 14 We cannot agree with Roger Shattuck when he says that 'nothing in this carefully composed sequence encourages the reader to regard Marcel's product as a work of art' (R. Shattuck, Proust (London, 1974), p. I55). Milly more perceptively notes the ostentatious 'mise en images' and rhythms of the passage as being more concentrated but less orchestrated than in Proust's mature style (Milly, pp. 132-36).</page><page sequence="5">574 Proust's Blank Page 'Une fois pourtant . ..' (I, 79) and ending 'auquel je n'ai eu a faire que peu de changements' (I, I8I), which precedes AP, and the paragraph which follows AP, from 'Je ne repensai jamais a cette page .. .' to 'je me mis a chanter a tue-tete' (I, 182). This surrounding text we shall call the 'blank passage', or BP.15 The non-artistic effect is created through the use of various procedures of demystification and depoeticization. The act of perception itself is demystified: J'eus une impression de ce genre et ne l'abandonnai pas sans un peu l'approfondir ... je sentais queje n'allais pas au bout de mon impression .. je ne savais pas la raison du plaisir que j'avais eu a les apercevoir ... j'avais envie de garder en reserve dans ma tete ces lignes remuantes au soleil et de n'y plus penser maintenant ... force me fut, faute d'autre compagnie, de me rabattre sur celle de moi-meme et d'essayer de me rappeler mes clochers. (I, 179-80) Thus the act of understanding is downgraded to the status of a vague feeling, and its committal to paper is given as the result of the absence of company - artistic writing is seen as a poor substitute for social chat. One must not forget that these reservations are emphasized partly in order to underline the importance of this unique occasion, when the act of perception will, exceptionally, be pursued and transposed into writing, but, none the less, there is here a plethora of disbelief in the artistic nature of the inexperienced artist's activity. The demystification, moreover, persists even when it is the act of transcribing rather than perceiving which is under scrutiny: Sans me dire que ce qui etait derriere les clochers de Martinville devait etre quelque chose d'analogue a unejolie phrase ... je composai malgre les cahots de la voiture, pour soulager ma conscience et obeir a mon enthousiasme, le petit morceau suivant quej'ai retrouve depuis .... Je ne repensaijamais a cette page .... (I, 181-82) Disingenuously, the narrator pictures his writing as an unwitting mixture of self- therapy and naive compulsion, trivial when accomplished, instantly forgotten, accidentally retrieved, and slightly imperfect ('auquelje n'ai eu a faire subir que peu de changements' (I, 181)).16 There is, furthermore, a deliberate depoeticization of the actual scene recorded. At its simplest level, this is a question of devaluing the linguistic register by using colloquial idiom: Le docteur Percepied qui passait en voiture a bride abattue ... nous allions comme le vent ... je sentais qu'elle m'avait si parfaitement debarrasse de ces clochers . . . chanter a tue-tete. (I, 179-82) The comic Dickensian name, the homely exaggeration of 'si parfaitement', the casual contempt of'debarrasse de ces clochers', the series of hackneyed epithets ('a bride abattue', 'comme le vent', 'a tue-tete'), combine to lower the aesthetic temperature. 15 Milly calls it 'la description banale', and refers to its 'description pure' and its 'point de vue causaliste'. As we shall proceed to show, this is a necessary, but not a sufficient, judgement (see Milly, pp. 132-33). 16 As Shattuck reminds us, Marcel has already, in the 'Montjouvain' passage (i, I55) said that we usually relieve ourselves of our feelings rather than express them: 'La plupart des pretendues traductions de ce que nous avons ressenti ne font ainsi que nous en debarrasser, en le faisant sortir de nous sous une forme indistincte qui ne nous apprend pas a le connaitre' (Shattuck, p. 138). But where the steeples passage goes further than the 'Zut, zut, zut, zut' of the Montjouvain passage is in its need for 'une 6lucidation qui soit a la fois mise en forme' (C. Mauriac, Proust par lui-meme (Paris, 1963), p. 151).</page><page sequence="6">PETER COLLIER AND J. D. WHITELEY 575 This propensity to downgrade the linguistic climate is even more marked if we concentrate on the register of metaphor; the 'dead' metaphors just enumerated are capped by the grossly inelegant assimilation of the 'fledgling' writer to a clucking hen: 'comme si j'avais ete moi-meme une poule et si je venais de pondre un cuf' (I, I82). This is, as Maya Slater and others have seen, evidence of the narrator's 'affectionate amusement' and 'indulgent mockery'.17 But the role of this particular piece of gentle deflation is, in context, also to desolemnize the moment of creation and to render the whole passage where the metaphor is deployed inartistic by comparison with the embedded 'artistic' passage. In addition, this metaphor, like so many of Proust's metaphors, is derived by a kind of comic, metonymic contagion with its context - the protagonist is seated, unromantically, alongside the poultry, 'au coin du siege ou le cocher du docteur placait habituellement dans un panier les volailles qu'il avait achetees au marche de Martinville . .' (I, 182).18 As we shall see, there are relatively few metaphors in the 'blank passage', but whether they are infiltrated by their context or not, that context itself provides a comic deflation of the scene, with the narrator and family bundled onto the carriage alongside the coachman on the doctor's urgent call - which is apparently not pressing enough to prevent Percepied from stopping to pick up Marcel for a joy-ride19 - and the budding aesthete forced to share a seat with the poultry and then starting to squawk like a chicken. Overall, however, the passage is remarkably free of metaphor, and of those few metaphors which it does contain, some are negatively marked by being cliches ('nous allions comme le vent', 'pris d'une sorte d'ivresse' (I, 181-82)) or by being comic ('comme sij'avais ete moi-meme une poule'), so that, perhaps surprisingly, the only metaphor remaining in this extended passage that is not thus banalized is the very striking metaphor likening Marcel's eruption of creative insight to the tearing away of the bark of a tree: Bientot leurs lignes et leurs surfaces ensoleillees, comme si elles avaient ete une sorte d'ecorce, se dechirerent, un peu de ce qui m'etait cache en elles m'apparut. (I, I80) This metaphor is perhaps signalled as such here, with its discreet metonymic derivation from the trees that the steeples will evoke, and thus acts as a positive marker reminding the second-degree reader that even this 'blank passage' is part of the final euvre, as well as a moment of sudden profundity at one of the vital moments in the progression of the protagonist's consciousness. Even so, it is ironically deflated by being conceptually wrong (as is the personification in the 'artistic' passage - for we know that the steeples have no personality and no intentions, no inner secret to reveal), and indeed this metaphor intervenes at a moment of great conceptual and stylistic tension, for the stylistic achievement through metaphor in the 'artistic' passage is a refutation of the deceptive impression the protagonist experiences, that of an intellectual advance towards the secret of matter. Similarly, the remaining 17 M. Slater, Humour in the Works of Proust (London, I980), p. 143. 18 The metonymic derivation is underlined here by Proust ('comme si j'avais et6 moi-meme une poule' (I, 182)), whereas in his mature style such contingent derivation is often less blatantly signalled: thus, again, we get the impression of an attempt in the 'blank passage' to pass it off as accidental in origin. 19 The apparent contradiction of the urgent call and the picking up of Marcel compounds the cliche of'a bride abattue' by making it seem inaccurate in what it implies.</page><page sequence="7">576 Proust's Blank Page metaphor, 'quelque chose d'analogue a unejolie phrase', although it is actually right, is deployed only in order to point out, from the author's point of view, that this metaphorical insight is precisely what the protagonist did not have at the time. Thus, the only two metaphors that are not banalized are negated. In conjunction with this subversive use of metaphor, the main thrust of the 'blank passage' is to be detected in its striking concentration of abstract and quasi-scientific vocabulary, deliberately eschewing 'artistic' effect. These analytic, ostentatiously non-figurative notations take on greater impact with a parallel reading of the 'artistic' version: BP - apercevoir les deux clochers de Martinville .. . que les mouvements de notre voiture et les lacets de notre chemin avaient l'air defaire changer de place, puis celui de Vieuxvicq qui ... semblait pourtant tout voisin d'eux; AP - Bientot nous en vimes trois, venant se placer en face d'eux par une volte hardie, un clocher retardataire, celui de Vieuxvicq, les avait rejoints. BP - sur lesquels donnait le soleil couchant AP - eclaires par la lumiere du couchant que .. je voyaisjouer et sourire. BP - je les aperfus de nouveau, tout noirs cette fois, car le soleil etait deja couche. AP -je les vis ... ne plus faire sur le ciel encore rose qu'une seule forme noire, charmante et resignee . .. (I, 18o-82, our italics) To complete this analysis one could in fact cite the two passages almost in their entirety in parallel. The analytic becomes systematically figurative, the dispassion- ately observed becomes an affective projection: BP - la forme de leur fleche, le deplacement de leurs lignes, l'ensoleillement de leur surface . . . cette clarte ... ces lignes remuantes au soleil (i, I80) where what is observed is all surface, unresponsive to the enquiring narrator, until it becomes transformed into the animated, metaphorical instances we noted above.20 The whole blank passage is not just blank in comparison, in parallel with the consciously 'written' second passage. Conceptually, for author as for reader, it is the passage printed first, the blank one, which is the later passage, the passage where the mature artist imitates a blank, artless view of reality. Our parallel reading is rendered acrobatic by the way in which the blank passage, although it precedes the artistic passage spatially in the text, actually reworks it conceptually and chrono- logically. The first passage we read, the blank passage, is the writer's knowing decomposition of the second passage, the one allegedly written with artistic intent by the as-yet-unenlightened novice. But rather more deviously, in the order that we have to read the two passages, the blank passage is also an imitation or a representation of inartistic events which we find immediately, as it were, rewritten by the aspiring protagonist. 20 We should note too the typically Proustian hesitations ofBP, 'en constatant, en notant la forme de leur fleche' (i, i8o), which are edited out of the immature Marcel's AP. Their function in the mature BP is to be part of Proust's impressionistic style: 'un 6elment de style impressionniste' (Spitzer, pp. 42 1-22).</page><page sequence="8">PETER COLLIER AND J. D. WHITELEY 577 When we read the blank passage the other way, as a knowing deconstruction of the artistic passage, we find that the author has deliberately substituted abstract or analytic vocabulary for metaphor, observation for anthropomorphic motivation, the casual for the intentional. He has replaced syntactic effects such as inversion and suspension with apparently artless, more paratactic structures, the effect of which is to decompose the temporal unity and loosen the spatial unity of the artistic passage: AP - Nous avions ete si longs a nous rapprocher d'eux, que je pensais au temps qu'il faudrait encore pour les atteindre quand, tout d'un coup, la voiture ayant tourne, elle nous deposa a leurs pieds. (I, 181) BP - Les clochers paraissaient si eloignes et nous avions l'air de si peu nous rapprocher d'eux, queje fus etonne quand, quelques instants apres, nous nous arretames devant l'eglise de Martinville. (I, i80) The speculative analysis of time and distance, interrupted by the wilful disruption of perspective created by the carriage, is rewritten in a more accidental, unmotivated syntax leading naively from the distance of the steeples to the surprise of the protagonist on suddenly arriving. More important perhaps than this relaxation of time is the expansion of action. This intradiegetic expansion includes interruptions which are excluded from AP no doubt on the grounds of the concentration and unity of time and action in AP. Instead of the depersonalized, detemporalized artistic passage, Nous poursuivimes notre route; nous avions deja quitte Martinville depuis un peu de temps et le village apres nous avoir accompagnes quelques secondes avait disparu, que restes seuls a l'horizon a nous regarder fuir, ses clochers et celui de Vieuxvicq agitaient en signe d'adieu leurs cimes ensoleillees (I, 181), with its unifying anthropomorphic drive (the village, rather than the carriage, now impels the action), with its elaborate inversion and suspension, with its subsump- tion of the time-scale into one moment articulated around the disappearance of the village and steeples, we find the blank rewriting thus: Je descendis causer avec mes parents en attendant le docteur. Puis nous repartimes,je repris ma place sur le siege, je tournai la tete pour voir un peu les clochers qu'un peu plus tard j'apercus une derniere fois au tournant d'un chemin (I, I80), with its hiatuses, disappearances, and reappearances, and its inclusion of the perceptual efforts of the narrator. The blank passage then, introducing the accidental and the peripheral, introducing the act of narrative perception which paradoxically makes BP seem less 'written', introducing also his feelings ofjoy and discovery and attempts to write, curiously, ingeniously removes from AP everything which made AP seem worth writing, and completes this decomposition with its more leisurely, fragmented, occasional syntax.21 In reading the first passage, the blank passage, we are reading an artistic unwriting of the artistic passage. In its elaborate deployment of apparently un-Proustian syntax and abstraction, accident, and objectivity, it functions none the less as a highly sophisticated embedding device in order to offset the artistic 21 As Spitzer says, 'on sent que Proust disjoint a dessein des elements qui vont ensemble' (p. 41 I). 19</page><page sequence="9">578 Proust's Blank Page passage,22 which is perhaps self-parodic, or at any rate deliberately sub-Proustian, in its stiff concentration of personification and serial metaphor, its elaborate inversions and suspensions, and deliberately immature in its suppression of comedy, longueurs, and personalities.23 Thus the 'blank passage' serves to heighten the effect of the 'artistic' passage, which in its turn appears to render the 'blank passage' all the more neutral. If the greatest art is that which creates the illusion of artlessness, Proust's 'blank page' must rank as one of the most subtle parts of his work, and its deconstruction of the narrator-protagonist's prize passage, destined for consecra- tion in the Figaro, one of the most provocative and stimulating exercises that he offers the creative reader. PETER COLLIER SIDNEY SUSSEX COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE J. D. WHITELEY 22 Spitzer notes the typical Proustian process of embedding one image within another: 'l'imbrication d'une image dans une autre ... c'est comme si un objet se refl6tait dans plusieurs 6tangs a la fois' (p. 459). Perhaps we might add that the embedding of AP within BP, with their subtly inverted functions (the 'artistic' passage concentrating parodical artistic qualities that the mature 'blank' passage gently deconstructs), has a similar effect on a wider structural level, where the text itself and its production become a problematic, shifting centre of concern. There is a similiar phenomenon in the 'Montjouvain' passage. Marcel's consciously artistic discourse gets no further than a quadruple 'zut', but the unobtrusive discourse embedding this performative failure is in fact a subtle example of Proust's mature style - for instance, the superficially trivial scene (which centres on a farm pond, a gardener's shed, and a clumsily-wielded umbrella) is the occasion for a sophisticated and yet almost imperceptible metaphorical network linking such disparate elements as a roof, a chicken, and the pond. 23 Milly notes that Proust's mature style contains a mixture of commentary and description, 'reality' and 'consciousness' (pp. 132-36). We might add that this is what characterizes the 'blank passage'. Milly also notes that A la recherche du temps perdu includes the banal, which the 'artistic' passage edits out. We have to reject the views of L. Pierre-Quint, who talks of 'ce morceau si caracteristique de sa maniere future' (Marcel Proust: sa vie, son cuvre (Paris, 1925), p. 30), and ofE. Seilliere, who says that AP is 'tout a fait dans sa maniere de maturite' (p. 265). More perspicacious isJ. Mouton, who mentions the 'traits de style d'un Proust encore inexp6rimente', and 'images faciles' (Le Style de Marcel Proust (Paris, 1948), p. 67), although we should be clear that it is the protagonist Marcel who is the perpetrator of the naive style.</page></plain_text>
