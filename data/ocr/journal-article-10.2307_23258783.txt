<plain_text><page sequence="1">Judaism and Tragic Theology, by Frederick S. Plotkin (New York: Schocken Books, 1973). Reviewed by Elliot B. Gertel Judaism and Tragic Theology is an elo quent and erudite attempt to show that Judaism can stand its ground in the arena of modern thought. Few volumes in con temporary Jewish thought are as solid in 306</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews their presentation. Most arise out ot the author's desire to gain converts and not to confront philosophers. Yet Dr. Plotkin is obviously not concerned with pandering to a large audience. Although his book is an eloquent work—perhaps the most polished and syntactically precise philosophy of Judaism to be found in the English language—it is a most difficult statement of commitment to Judaism to read. Every sentence is clearly written and finely constructed from a grammatical point of view, but the book's philosophical affirmations, built on complex ideas and learned allusions, make it necessary to read it at least twice in order to understand the relationship between chapters and the flow of the argument (especially in the last chapters). Plotkin s book is unique, as well, because he does not attempt to steer the reader under any particular ideological authority. As is apparent in his interesting epilogue, "The Problem of Secular Judaism," his chief concern is for the authority of Torah, which we affirm in assuming the "attitude of faith" (as op posed to the secular or "highly relativistic" attitude) "which declares that Jews did not make Torah a canon, but that Torah constitutes itself thecanon because it has imposed itself upon Jews, and invariably does so." Indeed, Plotkin would seem to regard much of the quib bling among ideologies of Judaism over authority and authenticity of Torah (i.e.. Jewish law) as "secularization," for "the more essential factor in regarding the Torah canonically has perhaps always been the adequacy of its witness to the revelation of God for the redemption of Israel. As in the Talmud and other major commentaries, so with regard to Torah, the written word suggests what is meant by revelation, but the Word of God is the actual meaning itself' (p. 169, italics mine). I find this latter assertion quite in íeresting and believe that it may prove a dable starting point for "ecumenical" iialogue between modern varieties of Judaism. Perhaps our ideologues do argue too much about the authenticity of their respective interpretations and so overlook the fact that God's word is in herently meaningful to all of us together. In order to pinpoint Plotkin's valid concerns and fertile insights, one must figure out whom he is addressing in addi tion to struggling with what he is talking about. Plotkin is not as kind to his readers as Arthur A. Cohen (who, provides an in teresting but highly subjective and therefore not too helpful introduction to the book); in The Natural and the Super natural Jew, Cohen devotes most of the book to specific critiques of chronoloei cally and intellectually diverse Jewish philosophers. Yet Plotkin's concern is with general philosophy and, since it is "general," he assumes that his readers are familiar with it. Yet perhaps he assumes too much. He obviously fills his book with much of his reading into Biblical theology and general philosophy. He is excited about what he has learned and how it all makes sense to him. He becomes quite technical, and he is clearly overioved with each insieht he shares with the reader. His book is not pedantic but passionately specific: he traces for the reader every maneaver of his successful wrestling with religion and philosophy. And yet he does compensate his readers for the difficulty of the subject with the :ourtesy of conciseness, which is perhaps more to be treasured than a tutorial presentation. In this review, I would like to try to ex plain Plotkin's work with the hope that :he reader, having been guided, as it were, through the rough spots, will turn to the book in order to see what he can get out of it (and it has much to offer people of diverse interests). Space does not allow ne to capture all of the nuances of Plotkin's thought (I am not sure that I lave caught them all even after three readings of the book). But I believe that snly a brief excursus is necessary to guide :he reader into a productive study of his &gt;07</page><page sequence="3">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought arguments; unlike most philosophers, Plotkin, who is a professor of English at Stern College, writes exceptionally well.

Whatever happens in history, however unbearable for man, it is not too difficult for God. readers are not as inclined to decipher dif ficulties in thought with the tool of carefully constructed language as they are anxious to pick out familiar platitudes from glib and fragmented sentences. Plotkin seems to regard Judaism as a "tragic theology" (although not in the Greek or Christian sense) because of its insistence that "the evil for which I can not assume responsibility, but which I participate in every time that, through me, evil enters into the world for the first time" (p. 13). Because man is both pitied and iudeed bv God. because he is both responsible and frail, he is "tragic." In the sense in which Plotkin defines the term, man can certainly be regarded as "tragic." Plotkin asserts (quite accurately, I believe) that the problem in the Bible is "not suffering in general, but the suffer ing of the righteous." Evil cannot be ex plained away as part of a general plan when it seems unwarranted (see p.22). But, since we suffer before God, it follows that we can anticipate redemp tion from Him. And to admit the promise of redemption is to regard history as more than iust the arena of human activity. In biblical thinking, history "is not, as in Greek literature, the scientific study of the past as a means of finding out the eter nal laws which govern all events. Rather, it looks toward the future, to a divinely appointed goal. The prohets. . . . pass judgment on the present, and dnve home to the people their responsibilities in face of the future" (p.44). The Bible views history not so much in terms of ultimate redemption as in terms of human respon sibility. Torah speaks of the present's participation in the promise, instead of the process of redemption. "Torah understands history in terms of crisis, not in terms of gradual development; to a large extent, the lines [of historical ups So ends what I consider the first of two stages in Plotkin's argument (chapters 1-4): an interpretation of biblical thinking in its own terms. The rest, to paraphrase Hillel, is commentary—intriguing philo sophical commentary or ratner, a aejense of many of the affirmations of Biblical thought. Plotkin posits that Judaism is characterized by a "centrality of the spirit" that is the "penetrative operative reality which determines the character of Jewish activity in all its layers. " Plotkin's discussion of "layers" on p. 68 is enough to frighten most readers away (the metaphor is ill-chosen, but felicitously employed nonetheless), yet all that he is really sa vine is that k'dushah and "nor mal mysticism" (Kadushiri) are so intrin sic to Jewish history that the problem of anthropomorphism is but the consola tion prize of those who have forgotten how to relate personally to God in the unique Jewish way. The "natural order" is filled with the promise of God's re demption because it is filled with the pro mise of God's redemption because it is filled with God-consciousness, the counterpart (if not the sedative) for what Plotkin elsewhere describes as the "tragic-consciousness" (p. 16). Modera science, with all its emphasis on rationalism and prediction, has created quite tenuous standards for prediction and explanation. (Note Plotkin's clever discussion of prediction and thp stnrlr p*rhar»oe nn n 70 whirh every baal ha - bayit will enjoy. But science has not even created an adequate language to discuss simple human activity (pp. 81-86). In other words, "rationalism" will have to do better in its case against religion; but, since it cannot, it might as well come to grips with faith. Chapter 7 sets the stage for Plotkin's at tempt to arrange some marriage between faith and reason. To be "full per 308</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews sonalities, we must rectify scientific and religious commitment. God's will is the archetype of all reality; through "par ticipation" in it, "everything is what it is and how it is" (p. 91). The remainder of the book expands on this not quite Platonic metaphysic. In his "Phenome nology of Religious Communication" (Chapter 8), Plotkin asserts that the "revelation of the numinous to the human consciousness (p. 107), which enables a man to pray, is far too sublime to be dismissed as a psychological aberra tion. In prayer, rational and irrational phases coincide; "the constant labor of portraying the inconceivable, and grasp ina thi* llnílttainah1íJl,, teams un with thp "ardent yearning to transcend, under the pressure of the vital impulse, the boun daries which divide the finite from the in finite" (p. 116). In discussing the "Significance of Irra tionality" (Chapter 9), Plotkin asserts that irrationality is a human affliction and does not have its origin in God. It arises from a human sense of "purpose lessness, a word that is merely a collec tive noun for an inexpressible multiplicity of individual things and individual ap pearances, which one and all follow a course to our disadvantage" (p. 126). The same humanistic self-centeredness that induces man to see the world as pur poseless can also spur him on to regard it as necessarily logical and predictable (Chapter 10). Both extremes must be avoided, and can be avoided by exploring a "non-humanistic philosophy of Judaism." which "frees us from a Theism which is merely inherited, and also from the belief in so-called substance, and from any overestimate of the human ego which we refuse to elevate to a principle of creation" (p. 159). Of course, Plotkin's thought is not without its problems, but his assertions are sophisticated and necessary to any cogent philosophical argument for the validity of Jewish belief. Especially pro blematic is Plotkin's view of revelation, in which the "experience of the numi nous" plays a central role in providing "a basic original complex by which the givenness of every revelation of the Divine which is subseauentlv Derceived can be tested" (p. 108). Such experience of the numinous is preceded by an irra tional "vital impulse which gives rise to those particular functions of religion and prayer which the simple experience of the numinous world would never have been able to obtain" (p. 108). Yet Plotkin cannot speak of a Jewish concept of revelation unless he relates more directly his view of the numinous to the Biblical teaching regarding the word of God. He already acknowledges that Judaism claims that the events in which Torah is anchored are not only historical ly true, "but also that they are the truths of history" (p. 47). How does man's ex perience of the numinous relate to God's revelation of law? Plotkin is quite correct in observing that the Torah is not con cerned with providing ' 'mere mottoes for ethical societies" (p. 50). But I do not believe that it is sufficient to assert, as he does, that the chief aim of Torah is to pro vide "redemptive history" (p. 50). The Torah itself constantly harps on its laws and ordinances, its hukkim u 'mishpatim. If Plotkin indeed assumes a ' 'nonhuman istic" stance, and if he cannot affirm the ultimate morality in the "inward security of self" (pp. 28-29), is not the word of God necessary as a law as well as a pro mise? Plotkin must not make the error of philosophically defending every aspect of Judaism that suggests some degree of ir rationality (God, prayer, miracles, etc.) except its central affirmation of a reveal ed law. He must not coldly suggest that in treasuring a law held to be Divine, Jews have pictured God in "the image of Torah" in. 611. As far as I know, even among the most zealous devotees of the "four ells" of the halakhah, the Torah has never been apotheosized. The other major problem I see m Plotkin's philosophy is his view of 309</page><page sequence="5">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought history. How much of history belongs to man and how much to God, if "redemp tion and history coalesce" (p. 55)? And if history is the realm of human success and failure [See M. Granatstein, "Theodicy and Belief, Tradition (Winter 1973)], how can it be said to "belong" to God (p. 55)? Plotkin deserves a warm yasher koach for his insistence that Jewish theoloffians have been miseuided in usine "the substitute languages of moral gradualism and evolution with a religious fervor" (p. 49). But how does viewing history as a process of evolution betray the human and Divine roles any less than viewing history as a process of redemn tion? After all, Shabbatean theology believed all things "holy" because it af firmed that whatever men do in history is "redemptive." Surely Plotkin is not sug gesting this. He must clarify his views regarding the "redemptive" nature of history. Although I may be slightly off the mark, I have tried to trace Plotkin's arguments as faithfully as possible. In order to qualify as a reviewer of the book (and not merely a sympathizer with it), I have isolated a couple of its aspects that trouble me. But I can hardly blame Pro fessor Plotkin for a couple of loose ends, which I hope he will clarify in future writings. Neither should any of us who have strueeled with his book blame him for our difficulties in reading it. He has not chosen to write vaguely, only philosophically. And if, as the Bible teaches (Proverbs 26:5), we must answer a fool according to his folly, then it stands philosopher according to his philosophy. Plotkin has felicitously appropriated the languages of the philosophical disciplines and effectively spars against those practi cioners in the craft of thinking who would dismiss religious language as irrelevant. I hope that my analysis and criticism of Plotkin's thought have rendered it more palpable. If you have tried to read his book and found it tedious, try again. Schoken Books is much to be lauded for Dublishine something with so much substance as to disqualify it immediately from the bestseller lists. The book deserves far more attention than it has received. We modern Jews have few philosophical statements of such a high order.</page></plain_text>
