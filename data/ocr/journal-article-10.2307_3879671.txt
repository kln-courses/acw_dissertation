God's otherness (mukhalafa), it is said, is presupposed in Islamic thinking from the Qur an.2 A review of the history of dogmatic development in Islam reveals, however, that during the formative period-that is, the period to about 9503-divine transcendence was only one alternative among several models attempting to explain God's unity. Indeed, it coexisted alongside its antithesis, "assimi- lation" (tashbrh), or as we term it, anthropomorphism.4 Muslim and Western scholars agree that, although the anthropomorphist model certainly existed-the various here- siographies attest to it-it existed only on the margins of Islam, in the extravagant fancies of a few deviant doctors." Thus, anthropomorphist ideas were relevant only marginally, if at all, to Islam's attempt at theological self-definition. Such, at least, is the current scholarly consensus. But how accurate is this reading of Islam's theologi- cal history? Anthropomorphic conceptions of God, particularly as they appear in scripture, have perplexed and perturbed religious thinkers of all eras.6 Although anthropomorphism became self-evident in the Christian doctrine of incarnation, the histories of Judaism and Islam are alike in that both present such conceptions as the source of great theo- logical controversy and strife.7 Contemplative Jews, in many cases influenced by Hel- lenistic ideas, thought it appropriate to find figurative meanings to the biblical pas- sages implying divine corporeality, meanings that were more palatable to their understanding of God's holiness.8 This trend was particularly strong in Egypt where the Greek translation of the Bible (Septuagint) was reportedly produced in the 3rd century B.C.E.9 Other scholars, in no way embarrassed by images of an embodied deity, increased and concretized these images.'o In the end, normative Jewish belief would settle on an incorporeal deity, thanks in no small measure to the great philoso- pher Maimonides." Judaism would eventually become so characterized by an "invisi- ble, non-theophanous" deity that one can easily forget how recently such notions established themselves as central postulates of the faith.12 Islam experienced similar developments, but contrary to the large body of academic literature examining Judaic anthropomorphist trends, relatively few scholars have Wesley Williams is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Near Eastern Studies, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich. 48105, USA; e-mail: wwwillia@umich.edu. ? 2002 Cambridge University Press 0020-7438/02 $9.50</page><page sequence="2">442 Wesley Williams studied Islam's courtship with an embodied God. The most important works to date are by Josef van Ess and Daniel Gimaret.13 Our knowledge of the scriptural sources of Islamic anthropomorphism, as well as our understanding of some of its main propo- nents, has been greatly advanced by the work of these two authors and several others.14 However, our overall understanding of the contribution corporealist ideas made to the development of Islamic orthodoxy has not advanced much past R. Strothman's characterization in the Encyclopaedia of Islam of tashbrh as a "heresy" and "grave sin in dogma.""1 W. M. Watt, for example, suggests that, "At an earlier period the main body of Muslims came to regard the mushabbiha (anthropomorphists) as unor- thodox."16 It is presumably for this reason Watt very minimally and superficially treats anthropomorphism in his The Formative Period of Islamic Thought. Has the "main body" always rejected such notions? Source material for the 9th- 10th centuries argues against this conclusion. A closer reading of the dogmatic litera- ture, as well as a more complete elucidation of the doctrinal positions of certain popular and influential personalities, suggests amendments to the usual view of theo- logical development in Islam. It seems that in an early period, anthropomorphist con- ceptions enjoyed wide currency among the main body of Muslims. The 9th century saw the beginning of the consolidation of Sunni doctrine under the leadership of Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855).'" An analysis of his views on these matters will therefore go a long way in advancing our understanding of early Sunni doctrine. It will be argued here that after Ahmad ibn Hanbal assumed leadership of the traditionalist camp during and immediately following the Mihna (Inquisition) inaugurated by Caliph al- Ma'mun (833-50), anthropomorphism achieved "orthodox" recognition.'8 WAS AHMAD IBN HANBAL AN ANTHROPOMORPHIST? Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal was arguably the "major cultural hero of his age."'" As the patron saint of the traditionalists,20 his dogmatic views would eventually become the shibboleth of Sunni "orthodoxy." Western scholarship, though, was late in recognizing this, and consequently Hanbali studies were neglected until the late 19th century.21 Works treating the development of Muslim dogmatics consistently overlooked Ibn Hanbal's creeds.22 When his theological positions were finally made the subject of academic inquiry, researchers tended to use only portions of the available material, making no attempt to rectify or justify the many divergent positions found therein.23 The result was a conflicting image of the Imam and his creed, particularly treating the Divine Attributes. While Patton and Anawati consider the Imam a true anthropo- morphist, Laoust, Strothmann, and Watt see in him a "great orthodox authority against tashbrh."24 Certainly, statements from Ibn Hanbal supporting both positions can be found in the material. However, in limiting the discussion to "anthropomorphism" in the strictest sense-the attribution of a human form to the divine-we can answer the question posed earlier-Was Ibn Hanbal an anthropomorphist?-in the affirmative without fear of contradiction. Surat al-Rahman A subject heretofore overlooked in Hanbali studies is the place of the Divine Form (al-sara) in the thinking of Ibn Hanbal. According to Abu Muhammad al-Tamimi al- Hanbali (d. 1095), Ibn Hanbal disapproved of attributing a "form" to God:</page><page sequence="3">Anthropomorphism in Early Islam: A Reappraisal 443 (Ibn Hanbal) used to rebuke him who speaks about 'the body' (al-jism). He said: "The Names are taken from language and from the Sharna, and linguists have applied this name to every possessor of length, width, thickness, form, structure, and components. Allah is outside of all of that."25 Although it is not unreasonable to assume that Ibn Hanbal censured users of the term "body"-the term is not sanctioned by the Qur'an or hadith literature in reference to God-he certainly had no reservations about attributing a form (sara) to Him.26 We find in his Musnad several versions of a tradition in which God will appear to the believers on the Day of Judgment in a disguise, then reappear in "His (true) form": God [at first] will come to them under a form other than that under which they knew Him. He will say to them: "It is I, your Lord!" They will say: "God protects us from you! We will stay here until our Lord comes to us. When our Lord comes, we will recognize Him!" Then God will come to them under the form under which they knew Him. He will say to them: "It is I, your Lord!" They will say: "[Yes], it is You, our Lord!" And they will follow Him.27 Speculative theologians (mutakalliman) from among the Sunni fold, finding this theomorphism objectionable yet unwilling to impugn the authenticity of the report, preferred to interpret the "form" as belonging to something other than God, such as the pseudodivinities (macbadat)-that is, the sun, moon, and stars.28 Ibn Hanbal dis- agreed. In two versions reported by the imam, we find the words "ya'tthim Allah 'azza wa-jalla ft s"aratihi" (God will [then] come to them in "His form").29 It is likely that Ibn Hanbal recognized this sura as a true attribute of God. Though we are not privileged to have his exegesis of this tradition, we do have it for a similar yet more explicit report: "God created Adam according to His form (khalaqa Allah Adam 'ala saratihi), his height being sixty cubits."30 This tradition played a significant role in Ibn Hanbal's dogmatic formulation. He reports it countlessly in his Kitab al- Sunna and invokes it in his published creeds. He states in his cAqTda I: "God created Adam with His hand and in His image/form."31 In his 'AqTda V, the imam argues: "Adam was created in the form/image of the Merciful, as comes in a report from the Messenger of God transmitted by Ibn 'Umar."32 Some scholars interpreted the "his" (hi) as a reference to Adam-that is, God created Adam according to Adam's form,33 but Ibn Hanbal insisted on a theomorphic interpretation. Abu Thawr (d. 854), a stu- dent of al-Shafi'i, stated concerning this hadith: "Rather, he [Adam] is according to the form of Adam. He is not according to the form of the Merciful." When asked about this, Ahmad answered: "Abu Thawr deviates and those who allege what he alleges."34 Ibn Hanbal then declared, "He who says that Allah created Adam according to the form of Adam, he is a Jahmr (disbeliever). Which form did Adam have before He created him?"35 For Ibn Hanbal, to deny that God truly has a form is kufr (unbe- lief). HadTth al-Ru'yd Of all the ahadrth al-sura, or "form traditions," those that are most menacing to the transcendentalists describe a theophany in which God appeared to the Prophet in a particular form. Ibn Hanbal reported in his Musnad: One morning, the Messenger of God went out to them [his companions] in a joyous mood and [with] a radiant face. We said [to him]: "Oh Messenger of God, here you are in a joyous mood, with a glowing face!" "How could I not be?" he answered. "My Lord came to me last night</page><page sequence="4">444 Wesley Williams under the most beautiful form (ft ahsan sara), and He said [to me]: 'Oh Muhammad!'-'Here I am, Lord, at Your order!' He said [to me]: 'Over what disputes the Sublime Council?'-'I do not know, Lord.' He posed [to me] two or three times the same question. Then He put His palm between my shoulder blades, to the point where I felt its coolness between my nipples, and from that moment appeared to me [all] that is in the heavens and on the earth."36 Not only is God's "most beautiful form" of interest; the physical contact between Lord and Prophet described here establishes divine corporeality in a manner unrivaled by other traditions.37 For Ignaz Goldziher, this report is "flagrant anthropomor- phism."38 Yet the imam's actual narration of this hadith, reported on the authority of CAbd al-Rahman ibn cA'ish, has not gone unquestioned. Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani reports from Abu Zur'a (d. 878) that the latter asked Ibn Hanbal about this report, and he replied: "This is of no consequence (hadha laysa bi-shay')."39 Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 1200) reports a similar position from Ahmad in his DafC shubah al-tashbih bi-akaff al- tanzih. He quotes the imam as stating, "The origins of this hadith and its sources are incongruous (mudtarib)."40 Yet Ibn al-Jawzi reports this very narration from Ibn Han- bal in his al-'llal al-mutanahiya fi al-ahadTth al-wahiya.41 'Abd Allah ibn Ahmad (d. 903), the imam's son, likewise narrates the hadith from his father in the latter's Kitab al-Sunna.42 According to Nur al-Din 'Ali ibn Abi Bakr al-Haythami (d. 1405), when Ibn Hanbal was asked about the report, he declared it to be correct or right (sawab).43 Whatever qualms Ibn Hanbal may have had about this particular isnad, as that was allegedly the object of his criticism,44 he had no issues with the matn (text). He re- ported it three other times with different chains of narration45 and explicitly declared sahth a similar hadith from Mu'adh ibn Jabal.46 The question, then, is how did the revered imam understand this report? Did he understand God truly to possess a "beau- tiful form"? The answer varies according to whose testimony one consults. Ibn al- Jawzi reports from Abu Ya'la's (d. 1066) Kitab al-Kifaya that Ahmad stated, "'I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form,' i.e., in the best position (mawdic)..47 Interpreting "most beautiful form" as "best position" effectively eliminates the anthropomorphism of the text. But there are problems with this report. First, it is at variance with Abu Ya'la's own exegesis of this narration, as found in his Kitab al-mu'tamad fi usul al- din. According to what we read, God truly has a most beautiful form in the same manner He has a soul and an essence: If it is said, "He is a person (shakhs) or form (sara)," it (should be) said: the report from different routes on the night of the Mi'raj mentioned, "I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form." And then He said, "Over what does the Sublime Council dispute?" And the application of that is not to be refused. Just as "soul" (nafs) not like souls and essence (dhat) not like essences weren't denied Him. Likewise form unlike forms, for the SharT'a (uses it in this manner).48 Second, CAbd Allah ibn Ahmad, the person most responsible for the publication of Ibn Hanbal's dogmatic works, quotes from his father a different exegesis of this ha- dith, which is startling in its frank anthropomorphist suggestions: My father reported to me... from 'Abd al-Rahman ibn al-'A'ish from some of the companions of the Prophet: "He came out to them one morning while in a joyous mood and [with] a radiant face. We said [to him]: 'Oh Messenger of God, here you are in a joyous mood, with a glowing face!' -'How could I not be?' he answered. 'My Lord came to me last night under the most</page><page sequence="5">Anthropomorphism in Early Islam: A Reappraisal 445 beautiful form, and He said [to me]: " 'O Muhammad!' ..." And my father [Ibn Hanbal] reported to us, 'Abd al-Razzaq from Ma'mar from Qatada [from the Prophet], "Allah created Adam according to His form." My father reported to us, 'Abd al-Razzaq from Ma'mar from Qatada, " 'in the best stature (ft ahsan taqwfm)' meaning 'in the most beautiful form (ft ahsan sara)'." Ibrahim ibn al-Hajjaj reported to us, Hammad (ibn Salama) reported to us ... that the Prophet said, "Allah is beautiful (jamfl) and He loves beauty."49 The implication of this collection of traditions is unmistakable. The "most beautiful form" is first identified with that form of God according to which Adam was created. This identification is further supported by the imam's interpretation of sura 95:4: "Surely We created man in the best stature (ft ahsan taqwfm)." Ibn Hanbal accepts the tafstr or exegesis of Qatada identifying man's "best stature" with God's "most beautiful form."'5 Because Adam was created according to God's own form, this iden- tification is logical. It is then affirmed that God is beautiful in the physical sense."5 Such an exegesis demonstrates a capacity for hermeneutical exercise, against the mini- malist fideism popularly imputed to Ibn Hanbal. If he was anthropomorphist in his thought, this was not due to irrationalism or blind adherence to the "letter" of scrip- ture. The report quoted here betrays the employment of the rational faculties, albeit in a traditionalist context. Hadith al-Shabb The most controversial and disputed form traditions identify the "most beautiful form" of God as that of a beautiful young man (shabb). Umm al-Tufayl, wife of Ubayy ibn Ka'b (d. 642), reported, "I heard [one day] the Messenger of God say that he had seen his Lord during sleep, under the form of a young man (shabb) with long hair (muwaffar), in verdure, on a carpet of gold, with sandals of gold on His feet and a veil of gold on His face."52 Such a crude representation of deity received mixed re- views among the Hanbalites. Al-Tabarani (d. 971) reported the hadith in his Kitab al- Sunna and al-Mu jam al-kabir.53 Abu al-Hasan ibn Bashshar (d. 925) declared it sahth,54 and Abu Ya'la cited it as proof, apparently judging it sound, as well.55 Ibn al- Jawzi, however, found the narration defective and attributed to Ibn Hanbal a similar judgment.56 When asked about the narration, the imam reportedly declared, "This is a condemned report. Marwan ibn 'Uthman and 'Umara (ibn 'Amir) are unknown (maj- hal)."57 Al-Dhahabi likewise cited this judgment from Ahmad.58 Assuming that this report from Ibn Hanbal is accurate, it is not necessary to read any anti-anthropomorphist sentiments in it. In fact, the opposite is suggested. The imam finds the isnad defective-Marwan and 'Umara are unknown-but says nothing of the matn. Ibn Hanbal's rejection of this report is therefore based on strict isnad criticism, not dogmatic considerations. This interpretation is confirmed by the imam's treatment of a similarly uninhibited narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas. Hammad ibn Salama reported from Qatada, from 'Ikrima, from Ibn 'Abbas, that the Prophet said, "I saw my Lord in the form of a young man, beardless (amrad) with short curly hair (ja'd) and clothed in a green garment."59 Ibn Hanbal not only acknowledged the soundness of this report; he made its belief obligatory. In his 'Aqrda III, the imam declares one of the fundamental principles of the sunna (usal al-sunna) to be</page><page sequence="6">446 Wesley Williams [t]o have faith in the Ru'ya (Beatific Vision) on the Day of Judgment as has been reported from the Prophet in the authentic hadrth. And that the Prophet saw his Lord, since this has been transmitted from the Messenger of Allah and is correct and authentic. It has been reported by Qatada from 'Ikrima from Ibn 'Abbas.60 He says again in his cAqFda V: In one of the sound hadrths about the Messenger of God, it is said: 'The Prophet has seen his Lord.' This is transmitted from the Messenger of God. Qatada reported it from 'Ikrima from Ibn 'Abbas.... Belief in that and counting it true is obligatory.61 This hadith is reported, in an abridged form, twice in Ibn Hanbal's Musnad, and 'Abd Allah narrates it repeatedly from Ibn Hanbal in his Kitab al-Sunna.62 With so many references, it is strange that Daniel Gimaret, in his discussion of this hadith and other anthropomorphisms of the sunna, claimed that the report "does not figure in the Musnad."63 It is there, albeit in an abridged (mukhtasar) form, reading simply, "I saw my Lord, Blessed and Most High." This shortening of the report has served some as proof of the imam's reluctance to attribute to God such an uncompromisingly anthro- pomorphic description. Ibn Kathir and Khaldun Ahdad suggest that Ibn Hanbal abridged it himself from "the hadith of the Dream (hadrth al-mandm)," i.e., the most beautiful form report, not from the hadrth al-shabb." For 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Hashidi, editor of al-Bayhaqi's al-Asma' wa-'l-sifat, the abridged narrations evince the imam's rejection of the expression "beardless, curly haired" and presumably "form of a young man."65 An abundance of evidence, however, suggests otherwise. According to al-Tabarani, 'Abd Allah narrated from Ibn Hanbal the full report, "I saw my Lord in the form of a young man with abundant hair."66 Abu Bakr al-Marrudhi (d. 888), reputedly "the preferred disciple of Ahmad ibn Hanbal,"67 asked his imam about this report, the latter getting visibly angry at those who denied it: I read to Abu 'Abd Allah (Ibn Hanbal): "Shadhan reported to us... from Ibn 'Abbas [that] the Messenger of Allah said, 'I saw my Lord as a young man, beardless and curly haired, and on Him a green garment.'" [I then said to Ibn Hanbal]: "They say68 [no one] reported [this hadith] except Shadhan." He [Ibn Hanbal] got angry and said, "Who said this? 'Affan reported to us that 'Abd al-Samad ibn Kaysan reported to us that Hammad reported from Qatada from 'Ikrima from Ibn 'Abbas from the Messenger of Allah, 'I saw my Lord, Exalted and Great.' " I [then] said to [Ibn Hanbal]: "'O Abu 'Abd Allah, they say Qatada didn't report anything from 'Ik- rima."69 [He got angry and] said: "Who said this?!" Then he pulled out [his book and in it] five, six, or seven hadrths from Qatada from 'Ikrima.70 It is evident from this report that, for Ibn Hanbal, "I saw my Lord" was simply shorthand for the hadith in question and did not imply a rejection of it in full. This is further confirmed by a report from 'Abd al-Samad ibn Yahya in which Shadhan in- structed him to question the imam about this hadith: [Shadhan said to me] "Go to Abu 'Abd Allah and say, 'Do you tell me that I should report the hadrth of Qatada from 'Ikrima from Ibn 'Abbas, "I saw my Lord in the form of a young man"?' " So I came to Abu 'Abd Allah and said it to him, and he said to me: "Report it, because the 'ulamd' (religious scholars) have reported it."'</page><page sequence="7">Anthropomorphism in Early Islam: A Reappraisal 447 Final confirmation that Ibn Hanbal affirmed the most blatantly anthropomorphic expressions of this report comes from an anti-anthropomorphist among the Hanbalite, Ibn 'Aqil (d. 1119). Yusef ibn 'Abd al-Hadii reported concerning Ibn 'Aqil: Someone asked Ibn Hanbal if he could report the haduth of Ibn 'Abbas ... in which the Prophet reported to have seen his Lord with short curly hair, and Ahmad is said to have told him to report it, since the 'ulama' have reported it. On this, Ibn 'Aqil said: "I treat these two traditions in the same way, in that Ibn Hanbal permitted him to report them interpreted metaphorically, not unqualifiedly, so that the form and the short curly hair are related to Muhammad, not to his Lord."72 This report, coming from one so hostile to anthropomorphism, is strong evidence of the imam's affirmation of the anthropomorphism of this hadith. Although Ibn 'Aqil does not hesitate to deem apocryphal any report offensive to God's transcendence despite its acceptance by the majority of his companions,73 Ibn Hanbal's affirming the use of these expressions was apparently too well established even for him to deny. Instead, Ibn 'Aqil chose a route he had traveled before: attribute to the imam the use of ta'wd (figurative interpretation) to do away with the anthropomorphism. This is contradicted, however, by Ibn Hanbal's own discussion of the report in which he condemned ta'wil in its regard: And the hadrth, in our estimation, is to be taken by its apparent meaning ('ala zahirihi), as it has come from the Prophet. And indulging in theological rhetoric (kalam) with respect to it is an innovation. But we have faith in it as it came, upon its apparent meaning, and we do not dispute with anyone regarding it.74 Can one who affirms the apparent meaning of a report that is so explicitly anthropo- morphic be considered anything other than an anthropomorphist? In 1988, Aziz al- Azmeh poignantly raised this question: Are we therefore to consider as correct the contention of Hanbalites that their position is one of a perfect equipoise, the just middle, the authentic continuator of authentic beginnings.... Can we agree with the Hanbalite position that such a statement (hadrth al-shabb) has no anthro- pomorphic intension when it is not subjected to an allegorical interpretation.... It is not rea- sonable to make a statement whose lexical sense is anthropomorphic, yet interdict both allegory and anthropomorphism.75 DID THE PROPHET SEE HIM WHILE ASLEEP OR AWAKE? Apparently, this question has been disputed since the time of the Prophet's compan- ions.76 It is equally unclear in Ibn Hanbal's creed. According to Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziy- ya, the confusion began with a group of the Imam's followers: But Ahmad did not say that [the Prophet] saw Him with the eyes of his head while awake.... Rather, he said once, "he saw Him" and once he said, "he saw Him with his heart."... And a third [opinion] is reported from [Ahmad] from the tasarruf of some of his companions that he said "he saw Him with the eyes of his head." [Yet] the texts of Ahmad are available and that is not in them.77 The situation is not this simple, however. Ibn Hanbal did report in his Musnad the exegetical tradition for sarat al-Najm (53:1-18), "He saw his Lord with his heart twice,'"78 but he also narrates a report from Ibn Mas'ud who claimed that surat al-</page><page sequence="8">448 Wesley Williams Najm refers to a vision of the angel Jabril, not God.79 In one of the vision traditions reported in Ibn Hanbal's Musnad, Ibn 'Abbas suggests that the vision of God occurred during the Prophet's sleep: "My Lord came to me last night in the most beautiful form-I think [says Ibn 'Abbas] he meant during sleep."80 However, there is textual evidence that the imam acknowledged a vision of God during a wakened state. According to Abu Muhammad al-Tamimi, Ibn Hanbal be- lieved that the Prophet saw God during the Mi'rdj with his eyes.81 In his Musnad, we read a report from Mu'adh ibn Jabal in which the Prophet said, "I got up last night [to pray]. I did the ablution, I prayed what destiny wished that I pray; then while I was praying, sleepiness took me, and I fell asleep, until I woke up (hatta 'stayqaztu) and there, in front of me, was my Lord, under the most beautiful form."82 Al-Tirmidhi reported this hadith from Mu'adh with the words "fa-'stathqaltu" (I dozed off) instead of istayqaztu making the appearance a vision or dream.83 Ibn Hanbal is alone in using the phrase "hattd 'stayqaztu" (until I woke up), implying a physical seeing of God.84 Al-Mubarakfuri relates the theory that hatta 'stayqaztu is a copyist's misspelling (tashrf) from istathqaltu, but Ibn al-Jawzi narrated the hadith from the Imam which included the disputed words, making this theory unlikely.85 Although it is probable that the imam understood at least one of two reported appearances as a vision,86 this in no way diminishes the force of the theophany or sighting. When asked about the visions, the imam replied, "Yes, he saw Him in reality (ra'ahu haqqan"), for the visions of the prophets are real.""87 The Imam even claimed to have seen God during his sleep.88 Balkafa Scholars are almost unanimous in attributing to Ibn Hanbal the use of the ancient balkafa formula. Goldziher, Wensinck, Halkin, Laoust, Makdisi, Abrahamov, and Watt all find in the Imam an advocate of this mediating principle (balkafa), which report- edly allowed the traditionalists to deny the Mu'tazilite ta'wrl or figurative interpreta- tion of the Qur'anic anthropomorphisms while concomitantly affirming the doctrine of the "incorporeal, transcendent deity."'89 According to Watt, the deadlock between the adherents of the literal interpretation of the attributes and the adherents of ta'wrl was broken by Ahmad ibn Hanbal with his use of bi-ld kayfa.9" The one dissenting voice is Joseph Schacht, who not only denies the existence of any anti-anthropomor- phist implications of the balkafa formula but also points out that "there is no evidence that Ahmad ibn Hanbal... used the term."9' Schacht is certainly correct. The balkafa formula appears in none of the Imam's six published creeds; nor does it appear in the two semi-rationalist creedal statements attributed to him by al-Tamimi;92 it is absent from his al-Radd 'ala al-Zanadiqa wa- 'l-Jahmiyya as well as from his Kitab al-Sunna. After affirming the mentioned attri- butes of God, Ibn Hanbal apparently never engaged in the practice of qualifying this affirmation by invoking balkafa. An example of this practice is the creedal statement by al-Ashcari (d. 935), "We confess that God is firmly established on His Throne bi- ld kayfa [without how] .... We confess that God has two hands bi-ld kayfa ... We confess that God has two eyes bi-ld kayfa .... We confess that God has a face bi-l&amp; kayfa.""93 Compare this with Ibn Hanbal's 'Aqrda I:</page><page sequence="9">Anthropomorphism in Early Islam: A Reappraisal 449 God is on the Throne and the Kursi is the place of His feet.... God is on the Throne, and the Throne has bearers carrying it.... He is in movement, He speaks, He looks, He laughs, He rejoices, He loves and He detests, He displays ill-will and kindness; He becomes angry and He forgives.... Every night He descends, in the manner He wishes, to the nearest heaven.., .the hearts of humankind are between two fingers of the Merciful; He turns them over as He desires and engraves on them whatever He wants. He created Adam with His hands and in His image. On the Day of Resurrection, the heavens and the earth will be in His palm.... The People of Paradise will look at His Face and see it. God will honor them. He will appear to them and dispense His grants to them. The servants will appear before Him [on] the Day of Judgment. It is He, Himself, who will ask them for their accounts. Other than He will not administer that.94 The conspicuous absence of balkafa is observed also in CAqjdas III and V, where the imam refers to the hadith of the young man, a most suitable report with which to invoke the formula.95 Ibn Hanbal, then, was an anthropomorphist. He affirmed for the divine a human form, including a face, eyes, curly hair, mouth,96 voice,97 breath,98 chest and two el- bows,99 back,00 arms,101 hands with a palm,102 five fingers'03 and fingertips,'04 legs, shin, feet, soul,'05 physical beauty, a limit, and even, shockingly, loins.106 He affirmed the external meaning of these attributes and refused to qualify them with balkafa. WAS IBN HANBAL A FIDEIST? A close reading of Ibn Hanbal's works reveals that, although he argued for the accep- tance of the literal meaning of the Qur'anic and prophetic statements about God, he was no fideist.'07 The imam was quite willing to engage in hermeneutical exercise, as observed earlier in regard to the hadrth al-manam. His treatment of sura 6:104, "Vi- sion comprehends Him not and He comprehends all vision," is also instructive: As for His statement, "Faces will be bright, looking to their Lord" (75:23) and He said in another verse, "Vision comprehends Him not and He comprehends all vison," they [the heretics] said: How is this?! It is reported that they [the people of Paradise] will look toward their Lord and he said in another verse "Vision comprehends Him not and He comprehends all vision." And they doubt the Qur'an and claim that it is contradictory. [But] as for His statement, "Faces will be bright," it means the Beauty and the Whiteness. "Looking toward their Lord" means to see their Lord with the eyes (ta'ayana) in Paradise. As for His statement "Vision comprehends Him not," it means in this world, not the Hereafter. ... And this exegesis (tafsrr) is what the heretics doubt.'10 Ibn Hanbal here presents himself as a willing mufassir (exegete). In harmonizing two contradictory verses-one seemingly anthropomorphist and the other anti-anthropo- morphist-the imam interprets them both. He makes the anti-anthropomorphist verse "Vision comprehends Him not" conform to the dictates of the anthropomorphist verse "Faces shinning, looking toward their Lord," then interprets the latter in a way that enhances its anthropomorphist tone: "looking toward their Lord" becomes "seeing their Lord with the eyes." Ibn Hanbal likewise employed the methods of ta'wrl. In his 'Aqtda I, the imam wants to argue God's actual establishment on the throne above the seventh heaven. To do so, however, he must first overcome objections raised by certain Qur'anic verses that appear to oppose such an interpretation:</page><page sequence="10">450 Wesley Williams God is on the Throne; and the Kursi is the place of His feet....

If an innovator and opponent tries to prove [the opposite] by God's words such as: "We are nearer than the jugular vein" (50:16) or "He is with you wherever you are" (57:4) ... and similar ambiguous [passages] of the Qur'an, then say to him [in reply]: What this signifies is knowledge [which is everywhere], for God is on the throne above the seventh and highest heaven, and separate from His creatures, but his knowledge embraces everything.'09 One observes in this passage the use of ta'wrl as well as the "if-then" disjunction characteristic of the kalam mode of disputation used by the mutakalliman. Ibn Hanbal likewise interprets God's words to Moses and Aaron, "I am with you both. I will hearken" (20:46) as "I will defend you both.""o A "slavish literalist" Ibn Hanbal clearly was not. His anthropomorphism therefore seems to have been a doctrinal choice made by the imam, inasmuch as it in no way necessarily followed from his hermeneutical methods. He chose to treat the anthropomorphic descriptions of God found in the scriptures as muhkamat, admitting to only a literal meaning, and the seemingly anti-anthropomorphist descriptions as mutashabihat, dubious and therefore requiring interpretation, for the apparent meaning of these was for Ibn Hanbal inap- propriate."' Later Sunni doctors would take the opposite position. Where the verses of the attributes are insufficiently clear in their corporeal import, Ibn Hanbal provides an interpretation of those verses that removes any ambiguity. We have, then, the major figure of 9th-century religiosity, highly learned and capable of thinking outside the "literalist box" of his less sophisticated contemporaries, choosing divine embodiment as his dogmatic position. A whole generation would subsequently embrace aspects of this dogmatic position. IBN HANBAL, ANTHROPOMORPHISM, AND THE MIHNA Anthropomorphist inclinations were not peculiar to Ibn Hanbal during this period. The ashab al-haduth (traditionalists), whose cause he championed, were frequently imprecated by the more rationalist theologians for their insistence on the literal inter- pretation of the Qur'anic and traditional description of God."12 The Mu'tazila character- ized the traditionalist as hashwiyya, a contemptuous term whose real meaning is un- clear but that probably meant "vulgar populace.""'3 The Caliph al-Ma'mun (d. 833), influenced as he was by the ashab al-ra'y (rational- ists),114 found this trend of fideistic literalism objectionable, and in 833 he instituted the Mihna in an attempt to impose elements of the rationalist creed on the public and possibly to stem the growing tide of anthropomorphism."5 Ibn Hanbal, due to his reputed refusal to comply with the caliphal mandate,"6 would become the hero-victim of the Mihna as well as the standard bearer of the anthropomorphists. The Mihna is not generally associated with an anti-anthropomorphist agenda, but there is ample evidence that aversion to the growing trend played a role in the caliph's move. Although al-Ma'mun chose as the litmus test the doctrine of the created Qur'an, this was but "the rubric under which was subsumed denial of anthropomorphism."''17 According to Wilfred Madelung, the assertion of a created Qur'an "constituted an attack on the anthropomorphic ... God of traditionalist Sunnism" and "the insistence of the traditionalists that God truly speaks is part of their general defense of an anthro-</page><page sequence="11">Anthropomorphism in Early Islam: A Reappraisal 451 pomorphic and personal concept of God.""8 A review of the caliph's letters to his governor in Baghdad, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim (d. 849-50), confirms the significant role aversion to anthropomorphism played in the government's policy. In his first letter, al-Ma'mun chided the traditionalists (hashwiyya) and their followers for, among other things, likening God to His creation: The Commander of the Faithful has realized that the broad masses and [lowly commoners] ... are a people sunk in ignorance and in blindness about God.... [They are] a people who fall short of being able to grasp the reality of God as He should be recognized, to acknowledge Him exactly as He should be acknowledged and to distinguish Him and His creation."19 In his fourth letter, written after the interrogation of the second set of jurists and traditionalists in Baghdad, the caliph applauded the work of his governor through whose efforts the cited people "agreed to reject anthropomorphism (tashbrh)."'20 Madelung is therefore incorrect when he states, "There [in the letters of the caliph] the traditionalists are not charged with anthropomorphism and ascribing organs to God."'21 As will be shown, both Ibn Hanbal and Bishr ibn al-Walid (d. 852) were accused of tashbrh.127 Abu al-cArab, in his Kitab al-Mihan, reports on a Mihna letter from al-Ma'mun in which al-Mamun stipulates not only the doctrine of the created Qur'an but also denial of Ru'ya (beatific vision), and of the denial of locating God in a place (makan) or on His Throne-that is, those issues that anthropomorphists used in argument to support their position.123 Al-Wathiq, al-Ma'mun's second successor as caliph (842-47) who continued the Mihna, forbade the profession of belief in the beatific vision.124 The Mu'tazilite essayist and polemicist al-Jahiz (d. 869), who was on personal terms with Qadi Ibn Abi Duwad, apparently understood anthropomorphism and its adherents to be at least one of the targets of the Mihna. In his Risala fi nafy al-tashbih written to the Qadi, al-Jahiz noted, "You know that although the supporters of anthropomor- phism have been crushed, reduced, and subjected to the Inquisition, their numbers have not decreased, the majority have not changed their views, and only a tiny minor- ity are dead."'25 It is noteworthy that many of the scholars cited during the first rounds of the interrogations were otherwise noted for their anthropomorphist positions or their sup- port for anthropomorphic traditions, particularly hadrth al-shabb. The prominent Iraqi traditionalist 'Affan ibn Muslim (d. 835), reportedly the first to be tried during the Mihna, was an important narrator of this hadith.126 Nu&lt;aym ibn Hammad (d. 843), who would become a martyr of the Mihna,127 was known for (and in some cases con- demned for) his narration of the report of Umm al-Tufayl.'28 In addition, the famous muhaddiths 'Ali ibn al-Madini and Yahya ibn Ma'in, both of whom were cited with the first round of interrogations, narrated similar traditions.129 Reviewing the reports of the interrogations, one discovers that Ibn Hanbal was specifically cited for corporealist views. During the second round of examinations, after first questioning three noted traditionalists on their views regarding the Qur'an's createdness, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim turned to Ibn Hanbal. Not satisfied with the imam's response, the governor took the interrogation in a different direction by asking about sura 42:11, "There is nothing like Him, He is the Hearing, the Seeing."'30 Although this verse had little bearing on the question of the Qur'an's temporality, it had by that</page><page sequence="12">452 Wesley Williams time become the bedrock of the transcendentalist interpretation of scripture.'31 During the exchange between the governor and his subject, a fellow traditionalist interrupted, "May God grant you righteousness! It speaks of 'a hearing one' because of ears and a 'seeing one' because of eyes!"'32 The governor then asked Ibn Hanbal about this, and the imam characteristically replied, "God is even as He has described Himself.""'33 Abu Nu'aym al-Isfahani (d. 1038) reported on the authority of Ahmad ibn al-Faraj, allegedly a witness to Ibn Hanbal's flogging, an isolated narration in which Caliph al-Mu'tasim (d. 842), al-Ma'mun's immediate successor, accused the imam of corpore- alism. On entering the palace, the caliph reportedly inquired, "Where is this man [Ahmad] who claims that God speaks with two organs [of speech]?"'34 During the course of the Mihna, Ibn Hanbal's standing among his peers grew, eclip- sing the prior traditionalist leaders.135 According to a reproach by Qadi Ibn Abi Du- wad, the imam became chief of a school of "commoners and riffraff."l36 As a corollary, anthropomorphism hardened and grew in influence. This is confirmed by the testi- mony of al-Jahiz, who wrote several treatises remonstrating against Ahmad ibn Han- bal and his supporters. These treatises are significant in that they provide a general time line allowing scholars to trace the development of anthropomorphism during this period and determine with relative accuracy the date it became the recognized creed of Sunni Islam under Ibn Hanbal's leadership. Al-Jahiz wrote the relevant treatises during the Mihna years (833-50).137 For him, the "great sin, the monstrous falsehood" at that time was not an uncreated Qur'an; it was anthropomorphism (tashbrh). 38 In 835, two years after the inauguration of the Inquisition by al-Ma'mun, al-Jahiz initiated a relentless literary campaign against an- thropomorphism with his epistle Risala fi nafy al-tashbih. 139 In it, one learns that before the Mihna, anthropomorphism already had "adherents of great numbers and manifest power."'40 Thanks to the Mihna, they had been crushed and afflicted, yet their numbers remained.'4' Despite the Mihna's apparent failure to eliminate or even curb the tide of anthropomorphism, al-Jahiz viewed the situation with optimism; the mushabbiha's "hearts are full and their souls troubled. This is a situation in which cunning and persuasion are called for, since force and violence are ineffectual."'42 This epistle's tone is characterized by disappointment yet also hope. Al-Jahiz can admit to fearing his antagonists while concurrently having hope for them (that they will change). Five years later, around 839-40, the situation changed. Anthropomor- phism concretized, and the optimism left. The cause was apparently Ibn Hanbal and his followers, whom al-Jahiz designated as the Nabita, a term probably meaning "con- temptible, suddenly powerful, irritating sprouters on the scene."'43 Ibn Hanbal's fol- lowers outdo the anthropomorphists of 835, who in comparison come out looking rather mild: One group among them [the people] asserted that God will be seen, without adding any expla- nation. If it feared being suspected of tashbrh, it explained, "He will be seen bi-la kayf," thus avoiding tajsrm (corporeality) and taswrr (attributing a form to God). But the Nabita sprouted, and the secessionist group insisted: He is a body; and it ascribed form and limits to Him and declared anyone who believes in the Beatific Vision without tajsTm and taswrr to be a heretic.'44 One learns here that the Nadbita emerged out of that original anthropomorphist block, the ashab al-hadrth. Second, the Nabita differ from their parent group in that they not</page><page sequence="13">Anthropomorphism in Early Islam: A Reappraisal 453 only refused to qualify their anthropomorphist affirmations with bi-la kayfa;'45 they also went a step further and declared anyone who did not go as far as they in assigning corporality to God an unbeliever. The attribution of form, limit, and a corporeal be- atific vision are all elements found in the various creedal statements of Ibn Hanbal.146 By this time, no doubt because of Ibn Hanbal's newly acquired fame, anthropomor- phism enjoyed even greater currency: "The acts of disobedience of this community had never exceeded sin and errors ... until the Nabita and their followers, the masses, appeared. Now the prevailing (ghalib) trend of this generation is kufr, that is anthropo- morphism and determinism."'47 It is now the Mu'tazila and the speculative theologians whose "hearts are full, souls troubled." The optimism of 835 had become disenchant- ment and ire by 840. Although it was the mushabbiha who were subjected to the Mihna, al-Jahiz bemoaned "this our (mutakallimtin) difficult era and corrupt time."'48 By 846, Ibn Hanbal and his band of theological upstarts could boast of having on their side "the masses, the pious recluse, the jurists, and the hadith people."'49 Discon- solate, al-Jahiz reported, "The Nabita today [indulge in] anthropomorphism with the secessionist... and the commoners are with them and the vulgar masses comply with them."'15 The Nabita are so strong that al-Jahiz anticipates the demise of Kalam at their hands, even while Kalam enjoyed the patronage and protection of the state.'15 He lamented: "the craft of Kalam ... is in retreat."'152 ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND SUNNI DOCTRINE The rise of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal during the Mihna resulted in the empowering and centering of corporealist ideas within the Sunni movement. When his ideas be- came the criterion of traditionalist orthodoxy, so too did anthropomorphism. 53 This is evident not only from the testimony of al-Jahiz, but also from the account of the Zaydi Imam and scholar al-Qasim ibn Ibrahim (d. 860). In his Kitab al-Dalil al-Kabir, al-Qasim accused the popular ulama of tajsrm: The belief which is pure of any act of disobedience is the certain knowledge of God and the freeing of thought from fancying God. For the fancies of the fancier occupy his thought only with regard to every owner of a form and body. Whoever fancies God as a body, neither knows Him rightly, nor approaches [even] slightly the certain knowledge of God. Therefore the schol- ars of the masses (hashw al-'amma) are devoid of certain knowledge of God.'54 For al-Qasim, "hashw al-'amma" and "hashwiyya" denoted the pro-Umayyad, anthropo- morphist traditionalists who accepted Ibn Hanbal as their principal authority.'55 Binya- min Abrahamov, editor of al-Qasim's works, translated the term as "scholars of the masses," indicating the general acceptance of these ideas among the community. This, however, contradicts Abrahamov's later claim that anthropomorphists "were a minority among Muslim scholars."'56 Al-Jahiz and al-Qasim seem to suggest otherwise. It is likely that Ibn Hanbal's staunch support of hadTth al-shabb explains its general acceptance among the ashab al-hadrth.'57 Abu Bakr ibn Sadaqa reported hearing Abu Zur'a al-Razi (d. 878) say, "The hadith of Qatada from 'Ikrima from Ibn 'Abbas in the Vision is sound (sah. h). Shadhan and 'Abd al-Samad ibn Kaysan and Ibrahim ibn Abi Suwayd reported it and and none denies it except the Mu'tazila."'58 'Abd Allah ibn 'Adi argued that "the report is not to be denied,"'59 and Yahya ibn Ma'in considered</page><page sequence="14">454 Wesley Williams those who denied the report innovators.160 Consequently the hadath al-shabb had a significant impact on traditionalist ideas of God at the time. Al-Qasim noted in Kitab al-Mustarshid: The Muslims [lit., those who pray] have agreed with us that the glances will not perceive God, except for a group of the Rawafid, and the Hashwiyya which agree with them. They said the Prophet had seen his Lord white-skinned and dark-haired. They related in another way that He had been seen in the form of an adolescent whose hair was cut off. Some of them claimed that this seeing was with the heart, and some others claimed that it was with the eyes.'61 The hadath al-shabb continued to shape traditionalist ideas of God well into the 10th century. Al-Ash'ari (d. 935) insisted on a vision of God by Muhammad and invoked the reports of Ibn 'Abbas and Umm al-Tufayl as proof.'62 A rescript of Caliph al-Radi issued in 935 against the Baghdadi Hanbalis under the command of al-Barbar- hari (d. 940), clearly the leader of the traditionalist block at the time, denounced them for anthropomorphist ideas based on the hadith quoted earlier: You claim that your ugly and disgusting faces are in the image of the Lord of the worlds and that your vile appearance is in His image; you talk of His feet and fingers and legs and gilded shoes and curly hair, and going up to heaven and coming down to the world-may God be raised above what wrongdoers and unbelievers say about Him.'63 The God of 9th-10th-century Sunnism was theophanous and corporeal. It was widely believed that an encounter with the divine inaugurated Muhammad's prophetic ca- reer.'64 Such a God would eventually be replaced by an invisible, non-theophanous deity, as it was in Judaism, but not before making a significant contribution to the development of Islamic orthodoxy, which has shown itself to be remarkably fluid over the years. CONCLUSION Ninth-century traditionalism laid the base for early Sunnism. Nascent Sunni doctrine, apparently due to Ibn Hanbal's influence, included elements that would be considered anathema by current standards of Islamic orthodoxy. With the patronage of the imam, anthropomorphism enjoyed a golden age of sorts. But early Islamic anthropomor- phism-at least, as represented by Ibn Hanbal-was not the result of a minimalist fideism, as is popularly assumed. "Literalism" no doubt played a part, but there was a great deal more "rationalism" and interpretation involved than has heretofore been acknowledged. In this sense, the anthropomorphism of Ibn Hanbal was not too differ- ent from that of the famous 8th-century mufassir Muqatil ibn Sulayman (d. 767), whose notions of God embarrassed later generations. In spite of Muqatil's "extreme" corporealism, he employed ta'wil in his Tafstr even on verses on the attributes.'65 Ibn Hanbal appreciated Muqatil's knowledge of the Qur'an but refused to transmit on his authority because of Muqatil's use of books.166 In any case, though the imam probably never attributed to God "flesh and blood," as did Muqatil,167 their views on God were similar. Both were greatly informed by hadith al-shdbb. What this demonstrates is that, in the early stages of Islamic theological development, when corporealist im- pulses were strongest, these trends were characterized less by blind adherence to the letter of scripture than by a significant degree of intellectuality.</page><page sequence="15">Anthropomorphism in Early Islam: A Reappraisal 455 A larger study is required to ascertain the sources of Islamic notions of a corporeal godhead. Similarities with Jewish concepts are suggestive but ultimately inconclusive. Certain pre-Islamic ideas of God survived Muslim iconoclasm, though the extent to which they did so is unclear based on the available material. The most that can be said with any degree of certainty is that normative Islam was a lot less hostile to such notions during its developmental stages than it is today. Historians of Islam must abandon the generally held assumption that, behind the divergent views that consti- tuted the "general religious movement" of the formative period, there exists an indige- nous and truly Islamic concept of God as "utterly other," and that when Muslim divines did agree, they agreed on this concept of deity. Islam, apparently from its outset, played host to varying concepts of the divine, either of which-or, possibly, none of which-could claim true indigenousness. From a historical perspective, tran- scendentalism and anthropomorphism were two alternatives available to Muslim di- vines attempting to interpret the most important pillar of their faith, "There is no god but Allah," and there were times that anthropomorphism was the model preferred by Sunni Islam.

The undisputed leader of the 9th-century traditionists/traditionalists was Ahmad ibn Hanbal. 1I use the term "orthodox" hesitantly, recognizing the difficulty with which it is employed in an Islamic context. Islam has no machinery comparable to the ecumenical councils of Christendom whereby a doctrinal tenet can be authoritatively declared orthodox or heretical. However, by a process of ijma', or consensus, a wide area of agreement can be reached, giving a doctrine or set of doctrines or practices an air of legitimacy: see Watt, Formative Period, 5 f.

In the doctrine of balkafiyya this position was regular- ized and a formal acknowledgment made of the limits to human intellect. The essence of the doctrine is that the terms and phrases of the Scripture are to be accepted bi-la kayfa. God 'has two hands bi-la kayfa. ... He has two eyes bi-la kayfa.' ... It is implied that the hands and eyes are not corporeal, and the phrase bi-la kayfa further suggests that no attempt is to be made to substitute something else for 'hands' and 'eyes' ": Watt, "Some Muslim Discussions of Anthropomorphism," 88 f. Cf. Abrahamov, "The Bi-la kayfa Doctrine," 365 ff. Although the literal meaning of the phrase is "without how" or "without asking how," it is commonly translated as "without modality" or without saying exactly how the attributes apply to God. It is further interpreted as a denial of kayfiyya or physical attribution: see R. M. Frank, "Elements in the Development of the Teaching of Al-Ash'ari," Le Mushon 104 (1991): 155 ff. 9"Watt, Islamic Creeds, 16. 91He says, "the balkayfa is primarily directed against reasoning, not against the excesses of crude anthro- pomorphism as has been supposed up to now": Joseph Schacht, "New Sources for the History of Muham- madan Theology," Studia Islamica 1 (1953): 34. See also idem, "Theology and Law in Islam," in Theology and Law in Islam, ed. G. E. von Grunebaum (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1971,) 11. 92Binyamin Abrahamov, while citing the creed attributed to the imam by al-Tamimi ('AqTda VIII) as an example of the imam's acknowledgement of this principle, notes that "the term bi-la kayfa, however, does not appear": Abrahamov, "The Bi-la kayfa Doctrine," 366. Abrahamov is thus required to derive the "con- stituents of the bi-la kayfa doctrine" from certain passages. 93Al-Ash'ari, "Al-Ibana 'an usul al-diyana," trans. Walter Klein, in The Elucidation of Islam's Foundation (New Haven, Conn.: American Oriental Society, 1940), 35 f. 94Ibn Hanbal, cAqrda I, near Ibn Abi Ya'la, Tabaqat, 1:29. 95In 'Aqtda III, Ibn Hanbal argues that one of the obligations of the sunna is "[t]o have faith in Qadar (divine predestination), its good and its evil. To affirm the hadith reports related to it and to have faith in them. It is not to be said, 'Why?' or 'How?' It is but attestation to their truthfulness and having faith in them. Whoever does not know the explanation of a hadith and whose intellect [does not have the capacity] to make him understand it, then that would be sufficient [i.e., to merely affirm the hadiths and have faith in them] .... And it is necessary for him to have faith in it and submit to it": Ibn Abi Ya'la, Tabaqat, 1: 241. The imam does not use the balkafa formula here, but he rejects the asking of questions. This is most certainly a polemic against the dialectical mode of argumentation employed by the mutakalliman. An</page><page sequence="20">460 Wesley Williams illustration of this mode of disputation and traditionalist sentiments toward it is found in the narrative of Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah al-Shaybani concerning Harun al-Rashid (d. 809), "Abu Mu'awiya al-Darir was speaking to Harun al-Rashid and he narrated to him the hadrth of Abu Hurayra, 'Adam and Musa had a dispute...' So 'Ali ibn Ja'far said, 'How can this be when there exists the gap [of time] between Adam and Musa that [which] there is?' He [the narrator] said, 'So Harun jumped up on account of it and said, "He is narrating to you from the Messenger and you oppose him by saying 'How?' " and he did not cease saying this until he calmed down and became silent." The imam's intent was to censure the mutakalliman, not the mushabbiha: cf. Ibn Hanbal, Kitab al-Sunna, 55. Although the balkafa formula is absent from all of Ibn Hanbal's extant works, the solitary witness to his use of the mediating principle is his cousin Hanbal ibn Ishaq. According to Hanbal, when the imam was asked abut the hadiths mentioning the descent (al-Nuzal), the beatific vision, (al-Ru'ya), placing the Foot on Hell, and the like, he replied, "We believe in them and consider them true without 'how' and without meaning (la kayfa wa-la ma'na)": see Ibn Taymiyya, Dar' ta'arud, 1:255. But this is certainly an erroneous attribution. Hanbal ibn Ishaq has been cited for several such attributions by respected Hanbalis: see Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, Mukhtasar al-sawa'iq al-mursala 'ala al-Jahmiyya al-Mu'attila (Cairo: Mat- ba'at al-Imam, 1960-61), 406. 96He says in 'AqTda I, "Allah spoke to Musa with His mouth": Ibn Abi Ya'la, Tabaqat, 1:29. 97'Abd Allah said, "I asked my father about a people who say: 'When Allah spoke to Musa he didn't speak with a voice.' And my father said: 'Rather, your Lord indeed spoke with a voice. These hadiths we report them as they came." Also, "My father said [from Ibn Mas'ud]: 'When Allah spoke a voice is heard like the dragging of iron chains on stones.' My father said: 'This is the Jahmiyya deny' ": 'Abd Allah, Kitab al-Sunna, 1:280, no. 533. 9From Qur'an 15:29; also, the hadith reported on the authority of Abu Hurayra, who alleges to have heard the Prophet say, "Wind comes from God's breath": Ibn Hanbal, Musnad, 2:267. 99Ibn Hanbal, Kitab al-Sunna, 151; 'Abd Allah, Kitab al-Sunna, 2:510.

'33Ibid., 33:213. After pressure from the governor to reveal his understanding of the meaning of this description, the imam feigned ignorance. Hanbal ibn Ishaq, the imam's cousin, reports from Ibn Hanbal a discussion between the latter and his interrogators. As proof of his claim that God sees, hears, and speaks in the literal sense, Ibn Hanbal cited from Qur'an 19:42 Abraham's reproach of his father for idolatry, "Oh sire, why do you worship that which hears not and sees not, nor can it avail thee aught?" Understanding the anthropomorphist intension of this recitation, the imam's examiners cry, "He has made tashbth, 'O Commander of the Faithful [al-Mu'tasim], he has made tashbTh!" On Ibn Hanbal's use of this verse, see al-Khallal, al-'Aqida, 106 f. 134Abu Nu'aym al-Isfahani, Hilyat al-awliya', 10 vols. (Cairo: Maktabat al-Khanji, 1932-38), 9:204 f. The two organs are probably the tongue and teeth. See Cooperson, "Heirs of the Prophets," 373. 135Patton claims that Ibn Hanbal was "established as the greatest traditionist of his time when al-Ma'mun introduced the Mihna": Patton, Ahmed Ibn Hanbal and the Mihna, 19. This does not, however, seem to</page><page sequence="22">462 Wesley Williams be correct. Fellow traditionist Abu Zur'a al-Razi noted, "I always hear people speaking highly of Ibn Hanbal and granting him precedence over [the traditionists] Yahya ibn Malin and Abu Khaythama. It was never that way before the Mihna; after he was tried, however, his reputation knew no bounds": Ibn al-Jawzi, Manaqib al-Imam Ahmad, 337 f. The pre-eminent traditionist during this period was 'Ali ibn al-Madini (d. 849), who presided over a study group in Baghdad attended by Yahya and Ibn Hanbal. One anecdote describes al-Madini lying on his back dictating traditions to Ibn Hanbal, who was on his right, and Yahya, who was on his left: Hurvitz, "Ahmad Ibn Hanbal," 274 f. 136Wilfred Madelung, Der Imam al-Qasim Ibn Ibrahim (Berlin: Walter De Gruyter &amp; Co., 1965), 41n. 1. 137Wadad al-Qadi, "The Earliest 'Nabita' and the Paradigmatic 'Nawabit'," Studia Islamica 78 (1993): 41 f.

'44Al-Jahiz, Risala fi al-Nabita, near al-Jahiz, Rasa'il al-Jahiz, 2:18. 145In his study of the Nabita ("Farabi's Funny Flora," 243), Alon erroneously states, "Al-Jahiz connected the Nawabit with the slogan of Bila Kaifa, the celebrated principle of the Hanbaliyah." The text clearly implies, however, that the Nabita did not use this formula. According to al-Jahiz, one of the differences between the Nabita and the earlier anthropomorphists (ashab al-hadrth) was the Nabitas' refusal to qualify their statements with balkafa. 1460n attributing a limit to God, see Ibn Hanbal al-Radd, 36 (Seal, Muslin Theology, 117). On the Ru'ya, see Ibn Hanbal, al-Radd, 23 (Seal, Muslim Theology, 112 f). 147Al-Jahiz, Risala fi al-Nabita, near al-Jahiz, Rasa'il al-Jahiz, 2:20. 148Ibid. 149A1-Jahiz, Kitab fi khalq al-Qur'an, near al-Jahiz, Rasa'il al-Jahiz, 3:297. 150Ibid., 3:300.

In his 'aqTda II, Ibn Hanbal pretends to speak on behalf of "ninety men from among the Tabi'rn (Successors), the scholars of the Mus- lims and Salaf (Pious Ancestors) and the Jurists of the various cities": Ibn Abi Ya'la, Tabaqat, 1:130. 153'Abd Allah reports in Kitab al-Sunna the statements of several prominent traditionalists condemning as JahmT those who would deny certain anthropomorphic narrations. 154Al-Qasim ibn Ibrahim, Kitab al-Dalil al-Kabir, ed. and trans.
