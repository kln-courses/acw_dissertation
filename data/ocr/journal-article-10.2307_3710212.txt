<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sociological Analysis, 1978, 39, 2:123-134 New Religious Consciousness and Personal Religious Experience* Donald Stone University of California, Berkeley The purpose of this paper is to generalize about characteristics of contemporary religious movements based on ethnographies and survey research data gathered by the Berkeley New Religious Consciousness Project. It is suggested that participants in these religious and quasi-religious groups are attracted by intense experiences of immanence. This is "new" religious consciousness to the extent to which these experiences take place in a context of pluralism, pragmatism, openness to science and rejection of dualistic theology. Religious experiences are seen as particularly attractive in reaction to continuing secularization in which innerworldly asceticism has lost its sacred underpinnings. The reaction to this loss is distinguished by an "innerworldly mysticism" compatible with science and modern bureaucratic society. The significance of these new religious groups lies in their fostering intuitive styles of consciousness rather than in their membership or longevity. Several years ago in Berkeley, I attended a movie about Carl Jung that included an excerpt from a BBC interview. The interviewer asked the venerable psychoanalyst, "Do you believe in God?" Jung replied, to the enthusiastic applause and cheers of the youthful movie audience, "Believe? I don't believe; I know!" This vignette points to one of the central threads running through contemporary religious and countercultural expression in America today. It suggests a shift from religious belief (or non-belief) to direct experience of the sacred; from faith (or doubt) to certainty of grace. This preoccupation with the personal experience of transcendence appears in a variety of religious or would-be religious pursuits ranging from LSD trips, to receiving the Knowledge from Guru Maharaj Ji, to asking Jesus into one's heart in a prayer meeting of the Jews for Jesus. Nationwide, there is a growing interest in Eastern disciplines, particularly yoga. Many of the experiences found in Eastern religions are available in the "transpersonal" trainings of Arica, est, Psychosynthesis, and Silva Mind Control. Psychology students are rediscover- ing William James and his book on The Varieties of Religious Experience. The popularity in recent years of the five books describing Carlos Castenada's apprenticeship to a Mexican sorcerer indicates the interest in intense experiences of oneself and the sacred. The Jesus People movement, which emphasizes a personal encounter with the Lord, mobilized more youth in the late 60s than any other countercultural movement, with the exception of the anti-war movement. The Catholic Charismatic Renewal founded at Notre Dame in 1967 is the fastest growing movement in the Catholic Church and it claims that hundreds of thousands have received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Hasidic Judaism is making a comeback among the children of apostate Jews, and Sufism, an ancient mystical tradition arising in Muslim countries, has taken hold on American soil. "Literary" Sufism has gained a wide following through the teaching stories collected by Idries Shah. The prominence of Bay Area Sufi communities was acknowledged in Jerry Brown's invitation to the Sufi Choir to sing at his inauguration as Governor of California. *Sponsorship and funding for the research on which this paper is based was provided by the Institute for Religion and Social Change in Honolulu and the Ford Foundation through the Research Program in Religion and Society at the University of California Berkeley's Survey Research Center.

Some of the preliminary findings of this project have been reported (Glock and Bellah, 1976; Wuthnow and Glock, 1974; Glock and Wuthnow, 1975; Heinz, 1976; Alfred, Stone and Tobey, 1975) and there is supporting evidence from many other studies in other locales which confirm the findings reported here. As a member of the research team, my particular focus has been the "human potential movement" (Stone, 1976). I also took part in investigating a variety of religious groups, and in designing and analyzing the survey. The survey, under the direction of Robert Wuthnow, was conducted in the summer of 1973, with 1000 one to two hour interviews representing a 79% completion rate of a three-stage random sample drawn to represent the population of the five counties that make up the San Francisco-Oakland Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. The survey population thus included a cross-section of "middle Americans" who do not share the countercultural lifestyles that abound in Berkeley and San Francisco. The survey over- sampled youth (under 30 years old) to assure significant numbers of persons involved in new forms of religious endeavors, and the statistics in this paper have been weighted to reconstruct the true proportion of youth and adults. The interviews included both open and closed questions about lifestyle, social and political attitudes, and religious belief and commitment. The interview schedule and details about the survey are reported in Wuthnow (1976). The case studies of religious and quasi-religious groups and their investigators include Hare Krishna (Gregory Johnson and Gar Kellom), a community of Jesus People: Christian World Liberation Front (Donald Heinz), a Kundalini yoga group: the Happy- Healthy-Holy Organization (Alan Tobey), an innovative liberal Presbyterian church Jim Wolfe), campus and youth ministries (Barbara Hargrove), the Catholic Charismatic Renewal (Ralph Lane), Divine Light Mission: Guru Maharaj Ji (Jeanne Messer), human potential movement groups, particularly est (Donald Stone), and the Church of Satan (Randall Alfred). The study of these groups varied from one to several years, and there was considerable range as to the extent the researchers were theologians rather than sociologists, and participants rather than observers. All the case studies were conducted openly with the knowledge of the groups except in the case of the Church of Satan, where only after the researcher had become Church Historian was his sociological interest made explicit. Increasing Interest in Religious Experience in the Bay Area The ethnographies of the Bay Area groups support the importance of religious experience for participation. With the exception of the Church of Satan, where interest in intense experiences was more instrumental than transcendental, a common element that seems to characterize most of the participants of these groups is intense experiences of themselves and of the sacred. The emphasis is on experience and faith rather than doctrine and belief.' 'This is consonant with Robert Bellah's distinction between "belief' and "religion" where "religious truth is embodied, not known truth." Bellah argues, "the effort to maintain orthodox belief has been primarily an effort to maintain authority rather than faith" and "is found only in religious traditions deeply influenced by Greek thought" (Bellah, 1970:220-221). Anthony and Robbins affirm the distinction between faith as an inner experience of ultimate reality and belief as objectifying religious symbols as absolutes in their contrast between "deep" and "surface" structure of religious symbol systems (Anthony and Robbins, 1975a: 410). Drawing on Chomsky's distinction between "deep</page><page sequence="3">NEW RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS 125 The experiential dimension, in contrast to the ritual, ethical or doctrinal dimensions of religion (Glock, 1965:c. 2), is salient for both leaders and participants of campus and youth ministries. In a survey of Bay Area college and university campus ministries, over two thirds of the campus ministers and 72% of the local church youth leaders chose religious experience as the most or one of the most important dimensions of religion. In a case study of a liberal Presbyterian church, the importance of the experiential dimension is demonstrated in the numbers of lay persons participating in church-sponsored yoga groups, encounter group marathons, ouija board sessions, and church festivals (Glock and Bellah, 1976:232-235). Getting high from repeating the Hare Krishna mantra is one of the most important inducements to joining the Krishna Consciousness movement. As one devotee said, "Kirtan [ritual in which the mantra is repeated] is the most exciting and sublime experience I have ever had. Every day I feel it again." The centrality of this intense experience is reflected in a temple poster which is reprinted on handbills and passed out to potential converts (Glock and Bellah, 1976:36): Stay high forever. No more coming down. Practice Krishna Consciousness. Expand your con- sciousness by practicing the Transcendental Sound Vibration. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. The chanting will cleanse the dust from the mirror of the mind and free you from all material contamination. It is practical, self-evident, and requires no artificial aid. Try it and be blissful all the time. In some groups a dramatic encounter with God or one's True Self is normative for initiation to full membership. This is particularly true for Catholic pentecostals and followers of the Guru Maharaj Ji. For the pentecostals, charismatic gifts of speaking in tongues, prophecy, healing, teaching, preaching and interpretation of tongues, often accompany or are evidence of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. The newly sanctified also usually report a sense of tranquility or of joy, or a release from tensions because they have given themselves over to the Lord (Glock and Bellah, 1976:165). In other groups such as the Happy-Healthy-Holy Organization (3 HO), the peak aspects of religious experience are devalued in favor of tuning in to the presence of God in everyday life. Religious events may be seen as lying on a continuum, ranging from aesthetic feelings of rightness and completeness to mystical ecstasy and cosmic consciousness. Religious experience is actual living through such events, observing and participating in the sense of ultimacy and sacredness. Thus religious experience may elicit a gentle "hmm" as well as an ecstatic "aha!" Respondents usually do not talk about their experiences as "mystical." Yet to the extent that they are events in which truths beyond human understanding are intuitively comprehended, they meet William James' criteria for mystical experience as noetic, ineffable, transient, and passive (James, 1963). Clearly not all the members of Eastern or Jesus groups have had an experience of extended cosmic consciousness or Divine presence, although most would like to have experiences like some that were reported in the ethnographies and survey interviews: While I was in a Bible class praying for the power to love, I had come to a sense of being a totally empty and worthless person. That night I went back to my VW van and challenged the Lord to do with me what he had done with the others. I had an immediate awareness of a supernatural presence . . . God was manifesting himself to me personally . .. grammatical structures of particular languages as derivative from a universal grammar built into the human psyche" and "surface grammatical structures of particular languages" which vary according to their interaction with non-grammatical domains, they suggest there is a core religious experience that is not determined by or reducible to other influences and is held in common across cultural influences (Anthony, Robbins and Curtis, 1974:493).</page><page sequence="4">126 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Here a devotee of Guru Maharaj Ji describes receiving the knowledge: The first experience of the knowledge consists of four events: seeing the brilliant white light, hearing the "music of the spheres," tasting the "nector" flowing in my body, and sensing the "internal vibration" .. With continued meditation there is a growing and unmistakable convic- tion that one is accompanied, tended, loved, and taught by God ... a kind of indestructible happiness that is not easily contaminated by difficulty or sorrow. A 27 year old woman, active in human potential movement trainings, says this about an experience during her year at Esalen: I took acid and then I knew beyond any doubt that there was a God. It was no longer a belief, but a reality ... I was participating in some divine pattern. There was an in and out motion or rhythm to it-first I was part of God, then I was God.. . Now my purpose in life is to reunite with God. Psychedelic drug use as a means to intense personal experience that opens the user to another reality may encourage the search for a way to be high all the time. As one Hare Krishna devotee said, "LSD opened the door, but Krishna allowed me to step through." Psychedelic drug use has been thoroughly documented as precursor to participation in Eastern groups (Robbins and Anthony, 1972; Judah, 1974). For example 95% of the 3HO members had previous drug experience. Sixty-four percent of those in the survey who mentioned participation in an Eastern group said they had been "high on drugs" compared to 23% of the rest of the Bay Area survey population. Similarly high propor- tions of Jesus People have used drugs previous to joining the movement (Heinz, 1976; Richardson, 1974). Certainly not all this prior drug use is associated with "good trips." Drug abuse may lead an addict to welcome Jesus into his heart or to seize on meditation out of despair. In some cases the lure of intense experiences may account for initial attraction to these new religious groups; in others it may be more of a factor in retaining allegiance. For example a Guru Maharaj Ji devotee said at the time he began meditating he was a thorough-going atheist and was looking for a tranquilizer rather than what he found, which was God. When intense personal experiences are facilitated through the auspices of a religious or quasi-religious organization -asanas in a yoga group, an altar call in a revival service or a guided fantasy exercise in a human potential group-the experiences may become interpreted as religious ones. The newly awakened or reborn often attribute the source of the experience to a charismatic leader or a group's gnostic powers. They are further drawn into fellowship and identification with a group that positively interprets and appreciates experiences that the everyday world discredits as deviant. While intense personal experiences contain the germ of antinomian tendencies, their first-fruits are to stimulate an identification with a community that promotes similar experiences. Thus these experiences of individual effervescence bind communities together and encourage the perpetuation of the experiences. Survey Indicators of Religious Experience in the Bay Area Estimating the numbers involved in new religious groups is problematic given that newly emerging groups rarely keep accurate records, and often overcount or undercount the many participants who do not become full-time devotees. A random population survey avoids some of these problems. The Bay Area Survey asked respondents about their acquaintance with 13 different groups. These included: Eastern and Countercultural: TM, Hare Krishna, Zen, Yoga; Personal growth: est, Scientology, Synanon; Neo-Christian: Campus Crusade, Jews for Jesus, Children of God, Groups that speak in tongues, Christian World Liberation Front.</page><page sequence="5">NEW RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS 127 Seventy-nine percent of the Bay Area respondents had heard of at least one of these groups, 48% had been attracted to at least one, and 21% had "taken part" (Glock and Bellah, 1976:275). Seventeen percent of the youth and 6% of the adults had participated at least one time in Transcendental Meditation, Hare Krishna, Zen or Yoga groups. If the premise of this paper is correct, we should find that people who had "taken part"-however that meaning varies from person to person-should indicate that reli- gious experiences are important in their lives. Of those who had participated at least once in an Eastern group, more than half described having had "a feeling that they were in harmony with the universe," and "that it has had a lasting influence." Only 15% of the other respondents feel it "has had a lasting influence." Thirty-one percent of participants in neo-Christian groups and 38% who had been in encounter groups responded similarly, while less than 14% of the other respondents mentioned such an experience. Twenty-four percent of the participants in Eastern groups reported "being high" on drugs with the experience having "a lasting influence." Five percent of the rest of the survey population reported a similarly influential drug experience. Of those who had any exposure to CWLF, Jews for Jesus, Campus Crusade, Children of God, or groups that speak in tongues, 63* said they had experienced "the feeling that [they] were in close contact with something Holy or sacred" and "that it has had a lasting influence." New Religious Consciousness American revivals have often emphasized personal experience and intuitive knowledge of the sacred (Ahlstrom, 1972; McLoughlin, 1959). Some commentators have identified the current ferment as latter-day versions of gnostic sects, antinomian cults and romantic tendencies that arose in opposition to established authorities in a declining Roman Empire, a turbulent Reformation Europe and a positivistic Enlightenment era (Adler, adler 1972, 1974:20-49; Hougan, 1976). American religious movements have been particularly susceptible to experiential religion and the authority of intuitive experience unmediated by ritual or ceremony (Judah, 1967:c. 1; Miller, 1956:c. 8). In some current groups the context for such intense experiences is science, pragmatic basis of authority, organizational pluralism, and rejection of dualistic theology. These elements are present in the Eastern disciplines and the human potential movement trainings (which have been strongly influenced by Eastern as well as Western psychological underpinnings). While these elements appear throughout American religious history, particularly in cultic movements such as Transcendentalism in the early 1800s, and in what Sidney Ahlstrom has called Harmonial Religion in the early 1900s, their incidence never has been documented to be as strong or as widespread as our study found them to be in the Bay Area in the early 1970s. It should be noted that some contemporary Christian movements, particularly so-called "Jesus freaks," fit these tendencies much less clearly. Current differences among Chris- tians parallel schisms between Liberals and Fundamentalists earlier in this century over the literal interpretation of scripture regarding geology, genetics, and historical accuracy of the Bible. Thus the religious orientation of the Jesus People of the CWLF and of less sophisticated churches serving "street Christians" differs considerably from that of liberal Protestant churches and Catholic campus ministries in this study. The contrast is greatest in the Jesus People's adherence to theological dualism, with organizational exclusivism also at issue. Catholic charismatics and "new" evangelicals fall somewhere in between (Quebedeaux, 1974). Thus, while the experiential emphasis of many new Christians is pronounced, it is not necessarily theologically innovative. Rather, iconoclastic expressions are legitimized through appeals to precedence and orthodoxy. Most of the contemporary religious and quasi-religious groups accept the authority of science as one of the bases of legitimization. This has not always been the case. Science has</page><page sequence="6">128 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS provided perhaps the greatest challenge to Christianity in the last 150 years, and many theological shifts have been prompted by the legacy of Darwin, Marx and Freud. The response to science has varied considerably. In some cases it has been unrelenting warfare between scientific explanation and literal interpretation of scriptural accounts (White, 1896). The most dramatic controversies have focused on human evolution and the historical accuracy of Biblical accounts. Predestinarian notions of God's providence and faith in personal surrender and moral willpower continued to be in conflict with social scientific explanation, especially the interpretation of the social crisis following the Industrial Revolution (Glock, 1972; Glock and Bellah, 1976:c. 16). A more recent and quite different response to science is shown in "process theology" which has been influenced by shifts from a Newtonian to an Einsteinian physics. Process theology has become an important influence in liberal Protestantism and has parallels in Catholicism such as Teillard de Chardin's evolutional theology influenced by his training as a paleontologist (Whitehead, 1929; 1933). In most contemporary groups science is not considered an automatic challenge to religious authority, where each new discovery diminishes the credulity of God's activity. Rather than the successor to a "God of the gaps," science becomes another way of knowing. Many new evangelicals and Catholic pentecostals are firm in their acceptance of the principal of historical criticism. They count respected scientists among their numbers. Evolution is accepted as the scientifically lawful way God makes His presence felt (Quebedeaux, 1974:37,75). People in Christian Science and spiritualist groups have often tried to enhance the authority of their beliefs by borrowing on the prestige of the word "science" without taking scientific investigation seriously. Mary Baker Eddy was not interested in controlled experiments in a physiology lab as confirmation of her "science." Yet today we find Zen meditators willingly don biofeedback devices to demonstrate that they meditate in alpha. Transcendental Meditation posters cover college bulletin boards citing laboratory tests that show that blood chemistry changes with repeating of the mantrum. Perhaps the paradigm for the mutuality of scientific and religious interest is the simultaneous fascination with both the ritual uses of psychedelic drugs and their biochemical processes. Scientific training may serve as preparation for appreciation of religious culture. One of the attractions of Taoist and Buddhist philosophy for educated elites from Christian backgrounds is its congruence with their scientific world view (Capra, 1975). These persons are not drawn from the same lower class blackgrounds that supply most religious movements that have emphasized direct religious experience and which have been characterized as "religions of the oppressed" (Lanternari, 1963). A second characteristic of new religious consciousness is its pragmatic attitude. Prag- matism is the democratization of the scientific method, and the new religious conscious- ness is pragmatically based. An old Sunday school song went "Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so." The contemporary approach supplements the scriptural appeal with "Try Jesus; invite him into your life and see what happens." In most Eastern disciplines the guru does not insist on belief, just on practice. 3HO holds that "kundalini yoga is a practical and objective technique for achieving liberation from the personal ego and for union with God" (Glock and Bellah, 1976). The authority underlying most human potential movement techniques is pragmatic: "If it works, do it." Gurus are followed for their expertise and proficiency in encouraging charismatic experience among their followers. Their authority is based on results first, then later perhaps on scripture or divine revelation. Hare Krishna exemplifies the use of this two step authority. Chanting and dancing provide powerful self-validating experiences that</page><page sequence="7">NEW RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS 129 create an initial attraction that is transformed into commitment through community life and intense study of the Vedic scriptures. The pull of an ecstatic state of consciousness is consolidated by learning a system of moral meanings and explanations based on A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's authoritative reading of the Bhagavad-gita as "the literal record of God's actual works." Similarly among Jesus People, the initial authority of a personal experience of Jesus or God is superseded by the Biblical authority that, interpreted literally, legitimates itself. A kind of shifting back and forth between the two authorities, like shuttling between deep structure and surface structure, corresponds to the contradictory moods that researchers have observed: alternatively an open aliveness and a dogmatic defensiveness (Heinz, 1976). Some groups such as Zen or est make valiant attempts to be dogma free, using texts to force the individual back to the authority of his own personal experience. There is not so much a search for the one true guru, but rather for any one who has got "zapping power" as a devotee of Swami Muktananda put it. As personal experence becomes the pragmatic basis for faith, cognitive and scriptural bases for belief are de-emphasized. Fifteen years ago the religious establishment was preoccupied with the theological debate over whether or not God was dead. Another important religious dimension that was stronger previously was emphasis on moral behavior and ethical imperatives. These were expressed in terms of codes for conven- tional behavior on the one hand, and radical social responsibility on the other. This ethical dimension underlay the social gospel, the civil rights, and early anti-war move- ments. In a pattern that parallels that of religious movements, radical political movements in the last decade have increasingly emphasized consciousness-raising and the direct experience of oppression rather than appeal to action out of moral duty. A third characteristic of new religious consciousness is organizational openess. If the authority of God's call is felt personally, then doctrinal differences will not be as threatening to religious personal identity. When a group claims to have "an answer" and not "The Answer" its boundaries are more permeable, particularly if survival is not dependent upon an expanding live-in community. Many of the newer groups are not set up to accommodate the totality of a person's unfolding needs, so seekers may go from group to group in what Alan Tobey has felicitously called "serial theogamy" (Alfred, Stone and Tobey, 1975:125). Syncretism is compatible with organizational openness. Thus we find Christian yoga societies, Zen Catholicism and a Buddhist group that combines Japanese fire walking with American country music. Bryan Wilson, in drawing attention to the extraordinary migration of contemporary religious ideas, says "the speed of transmission is also much greater and the possibility of syncretism far transcends that even of the plurality of agnostic cults of early Christian times" (Wilson, 1976:45). Generally there is intergroup good will and tolerance. An exception is the Jesus freaks who sometimes picket festivals of the Eastern groups and witness with an upraised index finger that there is only "One Way." One of the more conservative ministries in CWLF is the "Spiritual Counterfeits Project" which "exposes the works of darkness" by circulating well-researched pamphlets about TM, est, Hare Krishna and other "spiritual cop-outs." Liberal Protestants and Catholics have a lot more affinity for Eastern groups. They are willing to use the common metaphor that each person is on a different path up the same mountain. At least once a year there is a Bay Area festival called the Meeting of the Ways. For a weekend more than fifty religious and growth groups join together for an ecumenical happening that includes natural foods, singing, dancing, and presentations by prominent gurus and religious leaders. Contrast this with Protestant-Catholic relations twenty years ago when a Catholic risked purgatory entering a Protestant church and Protestants were fixated with Mariolatry and the eating of fish on Fridays.</page><page sequence="8">130 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS A fourth characteristic is rejection of dualistic theology. The theology of many of these groups is holistic. Dualistic conceptions of God and man are bridged in the religious experience of unity and oneness. God becomes immanent and man transcendent. A Kundalini yoga student puts it this way: Man is the finite of God and God is the infinite of Man. Throughout these groups there is a streak of environmental mysticism or what Gary Snyder calls a "Paleolithic revival" which breaks down the boundaries between human beings and the rest of the universe. Instead of receiving a revelation from God as with Moses and the burning bush, the contemporary seeker is more likely to report how he became one with the bush. The images of God held in these groups point to something less anthropomorphic and more immediate. In stressing the Holy Spirit, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal dwells on the aspect of the Trinity which emphasizes omnipresence rather than Fatherhood or Manhood. In the Eastern-influenced groups the theology is monistic, where the universe is considered an organic whole with interdependent parts. "Philosophical Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism reject dualism. For them ultimately there is no difference between myself and yourself and this river and that mountain" (Glock and Bellah, 1976:347).2 God language, except in the Jesus movement, refers less to He and more to thou, we, it and I. God is neither spirit nor flesh, female nor male. Cosmic "energy" is the image of God most universally used. Unlimited cosmic energy is not Wholly Other but open and accessible for all to tap into. In some of the current holistic world views the distinction between sacred and profane is transcended. Especially for Eastern groups there is no duality and no sin, only false awareness and insufficient harmony. The creation of evil is seen as illusion or as the refusal to take responsibility for what has been created. To the extent that people are 4"asleep" or "unconscious," evil abounds. People are not saved or damned in any final sense, but are on or off the path leading to divine unity. Karma is an increasingly used term that refers to uncompleted or unconscious experi- ence accumulated in this lifetime (or previous ones) that has to be dealt with to continue on the path toward cosmic consciousness. 3HO calls this "burning the dirt in the unconscious mind." With exposure to holistic theologies, liberal Christians are reviving an interest in life after death. Afterlife is increasingly seen as the next plane of karmic evolution rather than the final judgment of God. Karmic psycho-history is congruent with Freudian notions of complexes based on past acts and decisions. And as in psychoanalysis, karmic interpretations of fate assign responsibility without blame or guilt. Another feature of current holistic theologies is the blurring of cause and effect. The compatibility with contemporary science is seen in the view that the universe is cybernetic rather than mechanical; Einsteinian rather than Newtonian. Determinism is replaced by "an endless succession of intertwined events, each influencing the other." A Sufi riddle concerning a thief about to be hanged asks: Is that because someone gave him a silver piece and enabled him to buy the knife with which he committed the murder, or because someone saw him do it, or because nobody stopped him (Ornstein, 1972:74-75)? 2Anthony and Robbins have characterized monistic movements as stressing the metaphysical unity of all persons, an immanent Godhead, and relativistic and deterministic moral concepts such as the ultimately illusory nature of the phenomenal world (Maya), Karma and reincarnation (1976:10). They argue convincingly that monistic/dualistic concepts help to understand much of the variance between Eastern and Jesus groups. I prefer to use the term "holistic" as a trend that embraces much of the features of monism, and still applies to a number of Christian groups.</page><page sequence="9">NEW RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS 131 Significance of the Current Religious Revival In Contemporary Transformations of Religion, based in part on some of the preliminary findings of the New Religious Consciousness project, Bryan Wilson has argued that the new religious cults "do not provide the basis for a new religious culture" and that "their growth, transient appeal, decay, and eventual replacement by other enthusiasms appear . . . to be evidence of the trials of the human spirit in a world in which new techniques and increasingly rational procedures dominate man's social experience" (Wilson, 1976:viii). Wilson sees them as virtuoso religions in insulated communities whose appeal is to a minority of persons, mostly youth who are free from responsibility for family life and house and car payments. This is perhaps an accurate assessment of most current groups. Even if the Bay Area were a bellwether for national trends, and if interest in religious experience continues to grow, the membership of these groups will most likely remain only a few percent of the population. It is highly unlikely that all the groups simultaneously can be the dominant movements preordained in their millennial visions. Specific groups have most likely reached their peak growth (CWLF, 3HO, Hare Krishna). Human potential and Catholic Charismatic groups may be exceptions. The former is sufficiently removed from the counterculture and oriented toward legitimization by behavioral science; the latter is successfully institutionalizing charismatic experience with the Church. Richard Que- bedeaux estimates that 10% of the clergy have received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. While specific groups decline, a general receptivity to intuitive experience in society may increase. As new religious groups emphasize personal experience and intuitive knowledge, they may serve as midwives for new sensibilities. They provide and legitimate meaningful experiences that people in earlier years kept to themselves for fear of being ridiculed. Using a national sample, Andrew Greeley (1974:11) has found a surprisingly large proportion of people report mystical and peak experiences. A recent Gallup poll found that 31% of a national sample said "yes" to the question, "Would you say that you have ever had a religious or mystical experience, that is, a moment of sudden religious insight or awakening?" This is half again as many as the 20% who responded positively to the same question 15 years ago. Many of the questions asked in the Bay Area survey were replicated on a national sample of Psychology Today readers with similar findings of a strong interest in experiential religion (Wuthnow and Glock, 1974). Christian, Eastern and human potential groups encourage listening to an inner voice, and submitting with an open heart to personal experience and feelings as channels to the God within or True Self. This is an appeal to a self that is different than the self of rugged individualism. Particularly in the Eastern groups, non-competitiveness and the emergence of theyin is valued. The true self is not measured by its material accumulations or worldly success. These tendencies appear to reject what Weber saw as the astringent fruits of innerworldly asceticism: rationalism without transcendence and materialism without sanctification. Yet the form of the rejection is not necessarily otherworldliness or anti-rationalism. The significance of current religious groups may be less as social movements than as part of a cultural drift toward an "innerworldly mysticism" that is compatible with (non-reductionist) scientific orientations. Roland Robertson (1975) has suggested that innerworldly mysticism is one permutation of Weber's salvational typology that has been little explored but may fit the present scene. An innerworldly mysticism might have cultural survival value as compatible with contemporary science and complementary to bureaucratic post-industrial society. Interest in intuitive consciousness is increasingly present on scientific research agenda. It has become the focus for physiological research on the right hemisphere of the brain which controls the left side of the body and whose EEG activity correlates with intuitive</page><page sequence="10">132 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS and integrative functions and spatial rather than linear orientations (Ornstein, 1972; Gladman and Estrada, 1975). The timeliness of this research among lay persons is evident in the dozens of symposia and university extension courses that have attracted thousands to hear neurophysiologists discuss split brain research, demonstrate meditation tech- niques and read Sufi stories. Brian Josephson, a Nobel Prize winner in quantum physics, has been involved in esp research at Stanford Research Institute. In San Francisco the Physics Consciousness Research Group has been set up to apply human potential models of consciousness to social and political problems. Another dimension in which the current type of "mysticism" differs from Weber's retiring contemplative is in the domain of worldly action. Weber wrote that "the typical mystic is never a man of conspicuous social activity nor is he at all prone to accomplish any rational transformation of the mundane order on the basis of a methodological pattern of life directed toward external success" (Weber, 1963:176). Yet the characteristics of the current religious consciousness are ones that fit an innerworldly orientation: pragmatism, openness to science, organizational pluralism, and rejection of dualistic theology. Further, this orientation may prove to be compatible with bureaucratic life in post- industrial society. Finding satisfaction in religious experience may help accommodate late capitalism's characteristic separation of private life from vocational life, of finding meaning in consumption rather than production (Bell, 1973). A mystical orientation is applied to the private sphere of life as individuals supply their own solutions to religious problems, are assured of a sense of self (or sequence of selves), and gain respite from the workaday world to return refreshed to support bureaucratic asceticism in their work-role (Robertson, 1975:264; Anthony and Robbins, 1976). While Weber had little to say about the mystic who does not flee the world, he does give a passing reference to a fourteenth century contemporary of Luther whose attitude toward his private and public life foreshadows some current tendencies: A mystic of the type of Tauler completes his day's work and then seeks contemplative union with his god in the evening, going forth to his usual work the next morning, as Tauler movingly suggests, in the correct inner state (Weber, 1963:176). To the extent that a mystical orientation involves the insight that it is the self (or God) who creates meaning, and the workaday world is maya and not the creator of value, then boring jobs can be experienced as worthwhile by a detached perspective and a strong will. If they conceive of it as service, people may be happy in whatever work they do. In many contemporary groups the point of conversion or enlightenment comes with submission and giving up the ego. Such surrender may be functional for maintaining bureaucratic society, particularly as it becomes a value in group life and teaches the acceptance of hierarchical authority and compliance with orders. Weber's doubt about the desirability of mystical orientation was in large part due to what he saw as the relegation of the "social and ethical quality of action" to secondary importance (Weber, 1963:177). There has been considerable criticism of Jesus groups, Catholic Charismatics, Eastern devotees, and human potential movement participants for their preoccupation with individuals and their lack of concern for transformation at a societal level (Glock and Bellah, 1976; Quebedeaux, 1974; Lasch, 1976; Schur, 1976). All the groups studied insisted that self-transformation must precede social transformation, and this has a radical potential that has yet to be tested. The extent to which claims of an experience of God or inner self are reflected in people feeling more closely involved with fellow humans and other living things remains to be seen. Some evidence for the reverence for life is shown by the concern for the environment, particularly among youth in Eastern and human potential groups. Many of the participants in the groups studied</page><page sequence="11">NEW RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS 133 were appalled by private greed and bourgeois lifestyle and preferred the stance of being in the world, but not of the world. Whether these new movements will have a role in social change deserves to be addressed further than is appropriate here (Stone, 1978). What is clear is that the social forces that gave rise to these movements will not abate soon. The legacy of modern industrial society and the triumph of secularization has given rise to a crisis in moral meanings and ethical guidelines, undermined community and family life, and stimulated the quest for intense sensation and experiences to relieve boredom and affirm personal existence (Anthony and Robbins, 1975b; Wilson, 1976; Hendin, 1975). In modern secular society the "charisma of reason" continues to wane, and for those who feel reason and rationalization are not sufficient to express what is ultimately most important to them this new religious consciousness is attractive. The rationalist who undercuts traditional faith and discovers the limits of scientific explanations tends to find something to live by through establishing direct contact with the eternal (Robertson, 1975:256). The sense of certainty that accompanies personal experience and its immunity from scientific disconfirmation provides it with a charismatic aura. New religious groups are settings in which many youth look for the charismatic as one way out of Weber's iron cage. They seek the experiential and the meaning derived from it without necessarily abandoning reason, science, pluralistic views of reality and participation in everyday life.
