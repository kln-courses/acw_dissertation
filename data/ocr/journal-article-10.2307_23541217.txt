This is not simply because we are dealing with a period that is, for the most part, prehistoric; nor is it because Crete, even during so-called 'historic' periods, generally falls outside the purview of the major Classical historians, who mention the island's affairs only in passing (if at all); nor is it because of the discordant mix of overlapping approaches, assumptions and paradigms, derived from fields of study that generally do not converse with one another particularly well. The principal problem lies elsewhere, and resides in the peculiar intractability of the evidence. Why should the Cretan evidence be more intractable than that of other times and places? Part of the difficulty is one of finding a suitable model. In many areas of study of the ancient world, this would be simply the case of finding the best, or the most appropriate, analogy, and it is about this that debates would rage. But in Crete the problem seems to lie in finding any workable analogy at all. The Bronze Age palaces of Neopalatial Crete, for example, seem to be unlike either the 'palaces' of Mycenaean Greece or the earlier/ contemporary palaces of north Syria (Ebla and Mari), with their vast and complex administrative networks. This dissimilarity is not formal or architectural — since the Syrian palaces seem to share features such as central courts, storage areas and frescoes. Rather it is functional. A hundred years of trying to prove that the 'Palace of Minos' was both the residence of a king (or dynasty) called 'Minos' and the administrative/political centre of the whole of Crete has proven inconclusive at best. The 'Palace of Minos' is a structure which escapes obvious comparison with anything except another Cretan 'palace'.1 Unlike, for example, the Mycenaean palaces, where we now have the competing, if clear, analogies of the Near Eastern palaces on the one hand or the Hallstatt Heuneberg on the other, no plausible model has been successfully applied from the neighbouring societies of the Near East, Egypt or Bronze Age Europe for this structure.2 Similarly, the political communities of Iron Age, Archaic and Classical Crete have often been called 'poleis', or city states, and certainly they were, from a fairly early date, politically and juridicially autonomous communities centred on a particular settlement. But, if by 'polis' we mean to imply that in most respects they were identical to the poleis of the mainland, the Cyclades or Ionia; or if we mean to imply that either the Athenian unipolar or (following De Polignac) the Argive bi-polar model also applies with equal force to Crete, we may risk seriously misleading ourselves.3 In simply contrasting Cypriot kingdoms with Cretan poleis we may not be getting to the nub of the problem. This paper proposes that two means be used to understand the peculiarities of Cretan political structures in both the Bronze and the Iron Ages. The first is the 'threshold argument': communities larger than 500-600 individuals cannot function as 'relatively egalitarian' societies; both politics and ritual are needed.4 Site size then affects but does not determine structure. The second means (adumbrated above) is what might be called the 'negative argument' — determining what Cretan political communities were not. For this argument to develop, some clarification of terms is needed. The first term that needs attention is 'The State': at some point in Cretan history, states emerge. When? Do states emerge when civilisation emerges, or when a certain threshold of 'complexity' can be identified? * We would like to thank the other members of the Scientific Committee of the Conference (Katerina Kopaka, Maria Iacovou and Gerald Cadogan) for inviting us to write this general overview at the end. We would also like to thank Gerald Cadogan and John Bintliff for help in tracking down references, and for their other comments. ι This view is widely shared. Note the aporia of a well established 'Minoan' scholar: 'The regional dynamics and different trajectories that can be observed make me wonder whether, where Minoan Crete is concerned, we are not trapped into established theoretical models and definitions of political and territorial organisation. The scarcity of fortifications, an absence of an overt royal iconography and the difficulty of tying in the Cretan situation to territorial organisations known from the Bronze Age Mediterranean, leaves me frustrated' (Driessen 2001, 65; see also 2002; and Schoep 2010). 2 As argued by Sherratt 2001. 3 De Polignac 1984, 1995. 4 See arguments put forward by Bintliff 2000, 2010.</page><page sequence="2">332 CHRISTINA HATZIMICHAEL AND JAMES WHITLEY Following Childe, it would be easy (and perhaps misleading) to infer that, when we have scripts, palaces, some kind of 'elite' and some nice art, then we have states. In the Cretan case, the appearance of palaces at Malia, Phaistos and Knossos, constructed in a recognisable form between MM IB and MM IIA, has been taken as a clear indication that the 'state' has emerged.5 Recently such inferences, and their underlying assumptions, have been subjected to greater scrutiny.6 The term 'state' has become problematic. Some scholars (in particular anthropological archaeologists dedicated to the comparative study of ancient states) have doubted that states ever emerged in the Aegean, in either the Bronze or Iron Ages.7 It is now recognised that states can take many forms, and elite groups employ a variety of ideological, economic, administrative and political strategies within them.8 Scholars studying the Bronze Age have recently compared Cretan palatial polities to different types of states: the unitary, the segmentary9 and the 'theatre' state. For the Iron Age and later periods, archaeologists and ancient historians have made a distinction between the 'polis' (based on a single centre) and the 'ethnos'.10 The great debate, since at least De Polignac and perhaps Ehrenberg, has been 'when did the polis rise?'.11 There are difficulties with all of these terms, especially when applied to Crete; first, the 'segmentary state' is, on closer examination, is hardly a state — it is, if anything, a term describing a chiefdom-like pyramidal kingship structure, where authority is both loose and personal.12 Second, terms like state, polis (or 'micro-state') have been used for any community of a reasonable size (over 5 ha), with a likely sense of communal identity and a probable locus of politico-juridicial authority. Protopalatial Phaistos, Neopalatial Petras, 10th/9th century Sybrita13 and 7th century Dreros have all been seen as 'states' on this criterion — and certainly they were all political communities. But, while all states are political communities of some kind, not every political community is a state: a state has to be more than a community with a power structure. Rather, we have to understand on what principle that power was based — hence the disagreements over whether Classical Athens is best described as a 'citizen state' or a 'contract between gods and men'.14 Bronze Age states may be, 'defined on the basis of institutionalised power that is underwritten by social and economic stratification and maintained by a centralised administration'.15 But this definition works less well for the Iron Age. Perhaps Mann's is the best compromise: a state 'is a differentiated set of institutions and personnel embodying centrality, in the sense that political relations radiate outwards to cover a territorially demarcated area, over which it claims a monopoly of binding and permanent rule-making, backed up by physical violence'.16 This definition has the merit of accommodating a variety of ancient state forms with clearly different power structures — that is, it may apply with equal force to Bronze Age Mari as to mid-5th century Athens. There are often other assumptions made about state systems in Crete. First, there is a tendency to think that, if some kind of state had established itself in one part of the island, then states of this same kind and of this degree of complexity covered the whole island. Another, related assumption is that, once states had formed, all Cretan sites belonged to a particular state; a third is that all sites and settlements within a state's territory were integrated, economically, and administratively to the same degree, whatever their distance from the centre. The first assumption is clearly unwarranted. A counter factual is provided by the history of southwestern Crete, where states only emerge after 300 BC, and when they did emerge, as the confederacy or 'ethnos' of the Oreoi, they did not fit in to the prevailing 'polis' template evident in the rest of the island.17 The counter-factual to the second assumption is provided by the history of settlement in the Kavousi area. Here, the MM I—II settlement pattern shows no signs of site hierarchy. Settlements are small, all comfortably fitting into the 'hamlet' category.18 Neither Malia nor Petras seem to have exercised any degree of control over this area, control which, in any case, would have required a second/first order administrative centre. There is no evidence for such a centre within the survey area. Even if the sites fell within a 'polity' centred on Gournia, there is nothing to suggest that this site had any administrative control at this time. 5 See for example Cherry 1986. The existence or otherwise of proto-palaces in the preceding EM III/MM IA period is not germane to our argument here. 6 See in particular Schoep 2002a, 20026, 2006; Hamilakis 2006. 7 E.g. Marcus 1998, and other papers in Feinman and Marcus 1998. The idea that a 'chiefdom' must always precede a state (or if a polity is too small to be a state, it must therefore be some kind of 'chiefdom') is not one that has much relevance to the Aegean. 8 See for example Stein 2001 ; Blanton et al. 1996 ; Earle 1991 ; Feinman 1997. 9 See Knappett 1999. 10 A confederacy of small towns, as defined by Snodgrass (1980, 42-7). 11 See Ehrenberg 1937; and more recently De Polignac 1984, 1995. 12 Southall 1957; 1988. 13 For Sybrita, see D'Agata forthcoming. 14 See the differing views of (respectively) Runciman 1990 and Blok forthcoming.

Here the threshold argument, put forward by Bintliff, comes into play. Communities of more than 500-600 individuals cannot have been egalitarian. Relating site size to populations is a hazardous business, but, following the principles developed by Whitelaw, c. 250 persons per hectare seems a reasonable estimate for 'medium density' settlements.19 Sites over about 3 ha in size must have been organised on non-egalitarian lines, that is they must have been something more than a collection of more-or-less autonomous households. After Myrtos-Fournou Korifi in EM II, very few major communities in Bronze Age or Iron Age Crete fell below this threshold, even during periods of recession or collapse.20 This in turn implies that, for most of the period after c. 2000 BC on Crete, most communities would have had 'elites' of one kind or another. The real question is not then: do we have elites? The platitudinous and true answer is 'yes', but this tells us little about social or political change. Rather we should try to determine: what kind of elites (and accompanying power structures) do we have? In the past, it has been widely agreed that states require a stratified rather than merely a ranked social order, in Fried's terms.21 In states, political (and social) authority is partly inherited, or ascribed. In other words, states must be hierarchies. Recently, several scholars have questioned this assumption, and have proposed 'heterarchy' as an alternative — heterarchy being defined, not as the absence of power structures, nor an 'egalitarian' political order, but different and competing loci of authority within communities.22 Hierarchy implies the integration of political, judicial, economic and religious authority — if not a fully integrated elite, then a partially integrated one. Hierarchy implies a social pyramid with an apex — that is a stratified (not merely a ranked) social order {sensu Fried). Heterarchy implies separate loci of authority for 'politics' (however that may be defined pre-500 BC), or executive/legislative power, judicial authority, ritual authority, and the management of the social lives and the productive forces in any particular society. Status differences exist, and probably elites exist — but different, cross-cutting ones. In some cases, such as early 19th century ad Bali, the 'boundaries' covered by religious, political and economic authorities may cross-cut — they had separate 'religious', political and economic territories.23 When it comes to Bronze Age Crete, it is not helpful to see the political structure as being either uniformly hierarchical or wholly heterarchical. While the power structure must have been to some degree hierarchical, the society was in part heterarchical, since 'rigid hierarchies are unable to control diverse forms of social communication.'24 Given that Crete is not one region but several, and that there is strong regional variation from west to east, mechanisms we might call 'heterarchical' were necessary to maintain a range of inter-regional networks. Throughout most of its history Crete was a sum of socio-political and administrative networks with shifting boundaries rather than a centralised, hierarchical power structure. In this paper, we do not intend to look at all the evidence from all the periods. We will concentrate on three periods, and on two areas. The areas are: north-central Crete; and eastern Crete. The three periods are: the Protopalatial (i.e. MM IB—II); the LM III period (generally Postpalatial, i.e. LM IIIA2-IIIC); and the late 7th to early 5th centuries BC, the 'Archaic'. Neopalatial Crete, the best known and most widely discussed phase, will be noted by way of comparison. And we want to concentrate on four key variables. These variables are: 1) Size of major communities — as provided by Whitelaw for most of the Bronze Age, and some survey evidence (e.g. Praisos survey, Kavousi survey) and Nowicki25 for later periods. The c. 3 ha threshold is crucial. 2) Physical location of cult: is it integrated within the political community, or is cult 'apart', both physically and spatially? 3) Forms of commensality: is consumption largely household-based, or are there forms of public commensality (perhaps associated with monu mental central buildings) that serve to integrate communities, or segments of communities? Here M. Dietler's distinction between patron role feasts that make 'formalized use of commensal hospitality to legitimize institutionalised relations of asymmetrical social power' and diacritical feasts that involve 'the use of differentiated cuisine and styles of consumption as a diacritical symbolic device to naturalize and reify concepts of ranked differences in the status of social orders or classes' is crucial.26 4) Uses of writing and forms of administration: is writing used in the service of the 'state', either as 19 Whitelaw 2001,2004. This estimate is very much in line with site densities in the modern and ancient Near East, and makes the minimalist assumption that households represented 4-5 individuals (and no more). 20 This generalisation remains true whether or not we regard Fournou Korifi (at 1.25 ha) as a 'major' settlement. 21 Fried 1967. 22 Definition following Keswani 1996. For other discussions see Crumley 2001. 23 Geertz 1980. 24 Crumley 2001, 32 25 Nowicki 2000. 26 Patron role feasts (Dietler 2001, 82-3); diacritical feasts (Dietler 2001, 85-6). Haggis (2007) identifies diacritical feasting at Old Palace Petras.</page><page sequence="4">334 CHRISTINA HATZIMICHAEL AND JAMES WHITLEY archival records or as monumental law codes? Is writing connected either to ritual or forms of commensality? It might be objected that this list is hardly exhaustive, and ignores such things as rich burials, site hierarchy or monumental architecture. The importance of these latter variables may have been overstated. First, mortuary analysis has not proceeded far enough for us to make safe social inferences for any of the periods we consider; second, inferences drawn from site hierarchy in part depend on our ability to determine the boundaries of polities — for the sites could only form a political (as opposed to an economic) hierarchy in relation to the centres of such polities. It is this very point which is at issue. And, finally, monumental architecture has been over-emphasised. Large structures may be multifunctional, but that does not mean that their various functions were integrated within a 'hierarchy'. PROTOPALATIAL CRETE Much work has been done recently on the size of settlements in Neopalatial times, but much less on Protopalatial settlements. Some of these settlements were however substantial. Whitelaw's estimate for Old Palace Knossos is over 50 ha, giving a population of about 12,000.27 On some calculations, Protopalatial Malia is even larger, at 60 ha; Protopalatial Phaistos being about 15 ha. For other sites, the evidence is poorer: 20 ha has been claimed for Monastiraki, but this claim must be taken with a whole handful of salt. For sites in eastern Crete, the size of the Neopalatial settlements can provide a maximum estimate for their Protopalatial predecessors. So, Gournia cannot have been larger than circa 4 ha; Petras is no more than 2.5 ha in extent; Zakros is no more than 8 ha, and Palaikastro no more than 12 ha.28 These last two sites were, in all probability, smaller by half in Protopalatial than in Neopalatial times. On this basis, only Malia and Knossos are of a size that required the political and economic control of territory; and that territory need not have been very large (basically, from Spilia to the sea in the case of Knossos).29 Leaving aside the question of whether palaces also served as cult places, the spatial pattern of cult in Protopalatial times is not clearly connected to functioning polities. Most sites which can be unambiguously identified as sanctuaries seem rural. The peak sanctuaries, whose appearance over most of the island is one of the most striking features of the end of the Prepalatial period, are for the most part not connected to Protopalatial administrative centres (palaces), though some (e.g. Petsophas) are clearly linked to specific communities (Palaikastro).30 The greatest concentration of such sanctuaries (11) is in the Siteia peninsula. Of these, only Zou-Prinias could have had any relation to a known administrative centre (Petras). Neither Karphi nor Maza bears any obvious relation to the palace or town of Malia; Kophinas is some distance from Phaistos. And the triad of intervisible peak sanctuaries in the Rethymnon/Ayios Vasilios area (Vrysinas, Spili-Vorizi and Atsipades) seem, if anything, to be turning their backs on the site of Monastiraki.31 Similarly, the major cave sanctuaries of Psychro and the Idaean Cave, and the major 'spring' shrine of Symi (where cult begins in MM IB) are remote from any major palace, in locations which it would be extremely difficult for any centre to 'control'. Only the Kamares cave (clearly visible from the palace), and the peak sanctuary at Juktas seem obviously connected to Phaistos and Rnossos respectively. The epigraphic and artefactual evidence for cult provides a similar picture. There is no positive evidence of any palatial administration of any of these rural cult sites in either Protopalatial or Neopalatial times. The only document that would suggest some kind of administration relating to cult is a Hieroglyphic tablet from a disturbed context at Building U at Symi, probably dating to just before MM IIB.32 Nothing connects this document to any particular palatial centre. In sum, there is no conclusive evidence to support a picture of centralised control of rural religious practice. Furthermore, certain areas, such as Malia, Phaistos and possibly Chania, seem not to participate in the religious practices manifested in peak sanctuaries, and seem, if anything, to have their own, local forms of community cult. So far, the argument pulls in different directions. In central Crete, we have at least two Protopalatial polities that required a degree of economic (and so administrative) control over some (but not much) territory. Rural cult practice (leaving to one side questions of pillar cult, lustral basins and so forth) seems curiously disengaged from the palaces. This is not true however when it comes to commensality. Though plain vessels (earlier forms of the conical cup) exist, the Protopalatial period has long been famed for its fineware painted drinking vessels — the highly admired, eggshell-thin Kamares wares feature in every handbook. Less emphasised is the variety of vessels — the goblet, the tumbler, the straight-sided cup, the 27 Whitelaw 2004. Estimates for the size of Knossos in different periods are likely to be revised in light of the current urban survey of the city (the Knossos Urban Landscape Project). For preliminary notice of these results, see Whitelaw and Morgan 2009, 94-6; Evely 2010, 183-4. 28 All estimates follow those of Whitelaw 2001. Many have questioned the estimates for the size of Protopalatial Malia. 29 On the size of Knossian territory, Whitelaw (2001,2004) and Warren (2004) basically agree. 30 Rutkowski 1991. 31 See overview by Peatfield 1994. 32 Lebessi et al. 1995.</page><page sequence="5">DIFFERENTIAL COMPLEXITIES 335 concave-sided (carinated) cup and the hemispherical cup. Recently, major deposits of these drinking vessels have been found in both Knossos and Malia, which shed considerable light on questions of commensality. At Malia, Context I 3a has produced a concentration of 15 carinated cups, and 45 goblets and tall conical cups. An even more pronounced hierarchy, evident in shape, fabric, and quality, is evident in the MM IB deposit A from the West Wing of the Palace at Knossos. Of the 200 vessels, 150 are for drinking, and amongst these 'there is a remarkable hierarchy of quality'.33 One can even talk of a clear 'pyramidal' structure to the deposit, and the natural inference is that this relates to some ceremony or event serving to integrate a large segment of the population through communal drinking or 'feasting'. For a settlement of this size however (c. 10,000-12,000 inhabitants) such an event would have been more exclusive than inclusive. These drinking ceremonies are not however necessarily 'palatial'. Deposits (smaller ones, to be sure) of similar drinking vessels, albeit without the clear hierarchical pattern evident at Knossos, have turned up at Palaikastro as well as Petras.34 Even more curiously, such drinking vessels of this type (datable to MM II) have turned up in various rural locations in eastern Crete. Site 46 in the Praisos survey area, the Chosto cave and Sphakia-Pigi are about as far away from the palaces as could be imagined.35 If such drinking ceremonies served to integrate, such forms of integration were clearly not palatial. This too then supports a general argument for a diversity of political forms in Protopalatial times. This picture of diversity is reinforced when we come to look at Old Palace administrative systems. At least two scripts were in use, Linear A in the south (around Phaistos) and Hieroglyphic script in the north and east (Knossos, Malia and Petras).36 These scripts can be seen as aspects of two administrative systems. At one level these systems are complex, as they employ a variety of administrative instruments (various kinds of nodules, bars, tablets and sealing practices) — the Hieroglyphic system being the more complex of the two. At another level, these systems seem truncated. With the possible exception of Myrtos-Pyrgos, there seem to be no true second-order, administrative centres. Even in the northern-eastern area, there is no apparent implementa tion of standardised, more or less homogeneous administrative practices, especially when administra tion relies quite heavily on sealed and inscribed devices.37 There are clear differences in administrative practices between Knossos, Malia and Petras, differences that make it highly implausible that these three centres formed part of a single polity or state. What we glimpse are not so much coherent administrative systems governed by clear rules or principles (as we can see at contemporary sites in the Near East) as various heterogeneous constellations of administrative practice, some more systematic than others. Perhaps a more fundamental question is: what are these systems administering? To judge by the quantity of the surviving evidence, whatever it was, it was not much. Or rather, while some of the quantities of goods or commodities may sometimes have been large,38 the quantity of documents and their relative simplicity indicate that such large resources were mobilised only infrequently.39 That is, the evidence is consistent, not so much with administration of goods on a regular basis for such things as taxation or other forms of 'redistribution' as with irregular levies organised for very specific ceremonies or events. There is little evidence that literacy was being used either to tax or re-distribute on a large scale.40 There are no deposits that could conceivably correspond to archives, or at least none on a scale anything approaching Ebla or Mari, which would be essential if literacy was being used for the purposes of taxation and long-term record keeping. Large scale apparently archival deposits, such as those at Quartier Mu at Malia or the 'Hieroglyphic deposit' at Knossos are exactly that: deposits.41 They are not records that can be kept for later consultation. The scale of administration is much smaller than that 33 Knappett 2005, 147. This is MM IB deposit A, now fully published (Macdonald and Knappett 2007, 57-68). Drinking vessels with a pronounced 'hierarchical' structure can also be discerned in the MM IIA deposits D and Ε (MacDonald and Knappett 2007, 85-120), though here they are less pronoun ced. For the Malia deposit, see Poursat and Knappett 2005. 34 For Palaikastro, see MacGillivray et al. 1992, 132-7; for Petras, Haggis 2007. 35 For site 46, see Whitley et al. 1999, 231-3; for the Chosto cave, Schlager and Dollhofer 1998; for the site of Sphakia Pigi, see Schlager 1991, 10-20. For a comparison between these MM II and later Archaic forms of commensality, see Whitley forthcoming. 36 Watrous 2001, 198-213; Schoep 1999; Hatzimichael 2001, 102-53. For Petras, see nowTsipopoulou and Hallager 2010. 37 There are sufficient similarities between the administrative practices of Malia and Myrtos-Pyrgos to justify the inference that Myrtos might be a second-order centre of a Lasithi 'state' in MM II (Cadogan pers. comm.; see also Knappett 1999). The case for administrative links between Phaistos and Monastiraki has been made largely on the basis of the iconography of the seals. The relationship between the two sites remains unclear at present. 38 The quantities listed include: 7000 (of something) on the two sided bar #090, and 270 and 890 (of something) on two different sides of the four-sided bar #095. Both bars come from Malia Quartier Mu (CHIC, 16-17). For discussion of these large numbers, see Olivier 1990. 39 Always bearing in mind of course the fragmentary nature of the surviving evidence, and questions of preservation. 40 Contra Renfrew 1972. 41 For Quartier Mu, see Poursat et al. 1978; Poursat 1990.

Nor do these administrative devices seem to be regulating the gifts of the ruler, or ruling elite, to the gods or to sanctuaries. Of course, the surviving evidence is largely in the form of fired clay, whose survival is partly a matter of chance. Flat-based nodules (found only in Protopalatial Knossos and Phaistos) were used to seal written documents in papyrus or parchment. Might these have formed the archival missing link? It seems more likely that such perishable documents were letters — that is documents involved in transactions between local elites rather than involved in the administration of a state's 'territory'. We can then talk of literacy among an elite based in or around 'palaces', but we cannot clearly talk of literacy being used in the service of a 'state'. In sum, if the polities that developed around the centres of Monastiraki, Knossos, Phaistos, Malia and Petras can be called 'states', they were not homogeneous, all-powerful entities but rather small scale organisations with small territories and limited administrative interests. Much of Crete lay outside their control, if not their influence, and much that was new in Protopalatial Crete (including the burst of activity in rural sanctuaries) seems to have little to do with these centres. Drinking practices on the other hand do seem to be involved in forms of 'diacritical feasting' (in Dietler's terms), that is drinking/eating ceremonies which, like the Classical symposium, create 'aristocratic' bonds within a select (male?) group within a larger community. This Protopalatial pattern certainly changes in MM III-LM I, i.e. in Neopalatial times. Sites in general, and established palatial centres in particular, become larger, more clearly urban. According to Whitelaw's careful calculations, Knossos, Phaistos and Malia reach sizes of 75, 60 and 40 ha respectively.42 New palaces appear at Galatas, Gournia and Zakros.43 Established towns such as Palaikastro expand. Rural cult too seems to have a clearer link with palaces. The libation tables inscribed in Linear A from the cave at Psychro and from the peak sanctuaries of Juktas, Kophinas and Petsophas, and the inscribed 'double axes' from the cave at Arkalochori attest a greater palatial, or at least urban, interest in rural cult than before. The peak sanctuaries that flourish are those, such as Juktas or Petsophas, with clear links to palaces or towns. This fact too attests to a wider use of literacy employing the now pan-Cretan Linear A script. There are now more administrative documents in more sites and they turn up in a greater range of building types, attesting both to the existence of second-order centres and to private administration. The written record points to control of only a limited range of resource, that is chiefly wine, oil and grain.44 Evidence for archival storage remains ambiguous however — the only possible archive of clay tablets is that found at Zakros, an archive that contained tens of documents, not hundreds. The case therefore for large-scale centralised control exercised by the palaces over large territories remains weak. There is no consensus as yet about forms of commensality in Neopalatial times, but the appearance of drinking vessels with burnt bone deposits in some rural cult sites, and the gradual spread of the mass-produced conical cup throughout Crete (probably beginning with the 'squalid' vessels of MM III Knossos) may provide an argument for the 'démocratisation' of commensality in Crete at this time.45 Certainly, the pattern of 'diacritical' drinking evident in Protopalatial times is not so clear later on. Conical cups seem to be related to ceremonies involving a larger number of participants, and certainly a greater proportion of the population. This is not to say that status differences in consumption practices disappear — fine wares in MM III in many ways continue to develop from MM II forms. But we may be witnessing a shift from 'diacritical' to 'patron role' feasting. All this is not to deny the widespread evidence for Knossian 'influence' over much of the island, particularly its palatial centres. But influence is not control — and the case for Knossos or other palaces exercising 'control' by largely administrative means over much of the island is not strong. Similarly, palatial involvement in rural cult is not, in fact, evidence of control of that cult. It is more a sign of a convergence of ritual forms amounting to a common ideology that covers much (but not all) of the island. If an analogy is needed to flesh out this picture, then the 'theatre state' (Negara) of early 19th century ad Bali provides one. This was a polity with a prime centre, a primus inter pares, that did not control, but which did influence, through its monopoly, not of the material, but the 'imaginary means of production'. Ritual and ideological authority was maintained by conspicuous rituals involving a large number of participants — which have been called means of 'metaphysical theatre'. As Geertz puts it, the state did not control much if anything, and was free 'to dramatize power, rather than administer it'.46 This view of Cretan palaces is consistent with the further development of public spaces associated with them in Neopalatial times — 42 Whitelaw 2001, 2004. 43 Rehak and Younger 2001, 392-402. 44 Schoep 2002. 45 Conical cups were not an invention of MM III Crete: they are present in deposits D and Ε at Knossos, for example (MacDonald and Knappett 2007, 85-113), but in smaller numbers than more elaborate forms of drinking vessels. They are also a feature of MM IIB at Malia and Myrtos-Pyrgos, albeit of considerably finer quality than later MM III and LM I examples. Very few Neopalatial deposits dominated by conical cups have been published, a rare exception being Knappett and Cunningham 2003 (from Palaikastro). 46 Geertz 1980, 49.</page><page sequence="7">DIFFERENTIAL COMPLEXITIES 337 the West Courts of Malia, Phaistos and Knossos, and the 'Theatral Area' at Knossos. This picture cannot hold for Final Palatial (LM II IIIA) Knossos. Here, for the first time, we have evidence for a monarchy exercising administrative control over much (but not all) of the island. Writing (in the form of Linear B) is, for the first time, used almost exclusively in the service of a state we can call unitary.47 Much of the economy — textile pro duction and metalworking in particular — is being controlled, and the Palace is directly involved in cults such as that of Dictaean Zeus.48 LM IIIB-IIIC (POSTPALATIAL) CRETE But this state did not last long. Leaving aside the question of whether another palatial state, centred on Chania, survived until the end of LM IIIB, Knossos at least seems to have undergone rapid contraction. Whitelaw's (2004) estimates (supported by Hatzaki) put the size of LM IIIB-IIIC Knossos at around 6 ha. Similar contractions appear to have taken place at Phaistos. Though occupation at coastal sites in eastern Crete continued into LM IIIB, the size of such sites is hard to estimate. Even Palaikastro, where occupation seems to have been extensive (LM IIIA-B deposits turn up in most of the excavated area), seems to have contracted to around 5 ha. The end of LM IIIB and beginning of LM IIIC (c. 1200 BC) witnessed a major change in settlement pattern, with the appearance of numerous upland 'refuge settlements' or 'defensible sites' across the island. While most of these sites are small — many smaller than 1 ha, many others less than 2 ha — some (Kalamafki-Kipia in the east, Karphi in the centre, and Kolokasia-Kastri in the west) seem to be around the 3 5 ha range.49 In areas such as Kavousi where sites seem to be smaller, they seem to be connected in interdependent clusters.50 In other words, sites are not necessarily to be equated with communities, and communities must have exceeded the 'Bintliff threshold' necessary for a non-egalitarian social order. That is not to say that any of these sites were the centres of states — there are no signs of Linear Β literacy after LM IIIB Chania. Community identity however may have been reinforced through cult. The bench shrines which appear at Karphi, at Kavousi-Vronda and at Chalasmenos, and possibly also at Prinias, are the clearest sign that cultural and ritual homogeneity may not depend at all on palatial control.51 Nor does there seem to be any diminution of activity in major cave or spring shrines (such as Symi) after LM IIIB. As to commensality, we have to rely largely on pottery. As with the bench shrines, LM IIIB to IIIC painted pottery, particularly shapes associated with drinking such as the deep bowl or the kylix, show remarkable uniformity across much of the island.52 The 'spiral hook' for example can be seen on fragments of deep bowls from Karphi, Kipia above Kalamafki and Palaikastro-Kastri.53 LMIIIC is also the heyday of the large, elaborately decorated krater. Unlike cups, the decoration of kraters is far from uniform — but our point is that they are highly and elaborately decorated, and this decoration probably relates to their role as centrepieces of a certain form of 'diacritical feasting'. One of us has argued elsewhere that the drinking cups recovered from the surface at a major building at Kipia above Kalamafki represent some form of communal drinking.54 Krater-centred drinking practices evident here and in a major deposit at Phaistos certainly represent a departure from the more 'participatory' practices of Neopalatial Crete.55 We would argue that such deposits represent the re-appearance of 'diacritical feasting' — that is the use of some form of communal eating or drinking to reinforce bonds between a new kind of elite.56 This is an argument, not so much for a proto- or micro-state, as a proto-oligarchy. Before 'fast forwarding' to late Archaic and early Classical times, a word about cult in the EIA of Crete: whereas in the mainland, votive deposits of metalwork remain thin on the ground before 700 bc, large quantities of bronze continue to be deposited at the major Cretan sanctuaries of the Idaean Cave and Symi throughout the period 1000-700 BC. The Idaean Cave receives rich deposits of Oriental and Orientalising metalwork from at least 950 BC.57 Bronze figurines and plaques were deposited at Symi in large numbers from at least the 10th century onwards.58 In both these rural sanctuaries, deposition (as measured in both the quantity and the quality of metal objects) peaks in the 8th century BC, and declines in the 7th. Though we would not question the obvious inference that some kind of elite continued to exist in Iron Age Crete, we 47 Bennet 1985. 48 Ventris and Chadwick 1973, esp. 303-12. 49 Kipia above Kalamafki: Whitley et al. 1999,238-44; Nowicki 2000, 56-8; Karphi: Nowicki 2000, 157-64; Ayios Georgios (formerly Kolokasia)-Kastri: Nowicki 2000, 210-13.

Indeed, competitive gift-giving to deities may be more a symptom of a generalised status anxiety — of a status that had to be continually performed to be made real.59 The decline of such competitive gift giving may, perversely, be a more secure basis on which to infer a stratified social order. LATE ARCHAIC AND EARLY CLASSICAL CRETE (c. 600-400 BC) Paula Perlman lists 49 Cretan 'poleis' which, at some time, functioned as independent, juridicially autonomous communities during Archaic and Classical times.60 It seems to us highly unlikely that all these communities were both fully politically independent and full-functioning, unitary states during the whole of this period. Few of these sites have been investigated in such as way as to provide us with accurate estimates of size. The most important polis, Gortys, is covered by a major Roman city. Whitelaw's best estimate for the size of Archaic to Classical Knossos is around 16 18 ha, giving a population of around 4000 persons.61 This estimate may be too small — survey indicates that Praisos may have reached a maximum size of around 28 ha by 300 BC, and probably 20 ha by 400 BC. Investigations at Eleutherna have not yet provided us with an estimate of size, but both the topography and scale of this city is very similar to Praisos.62 Some of the Archaic and early Classical sites that have been most thoroughly investigated in recent years were communities that never reached the big league. Occupation at Prinias (ancient Rhizenia) seems not to have extended beyond the Patela (small plateau); it does not survive as an independent community into late Classical times. Azoria (perhaps ancient Larissa) was abandoned/destroyed in early Classical times (c. 475 BC).63 Whatever uncertainties remain about these figures, it seems clear that sites had increased in size substantially since LMIIIC times. Whereas one would be hard put to find a LM IIIC settlement over 8 ha, even the smaller autonomous communities of late Archaic times (Azoria) seemed to have reached 15 ha,64 and the upper range of settlement size must have been around 20-5 ha. Here the contrast between both the Protopalatial and the Neopalatial pattern must be stressed. In both palatial periods, there were perhaps three or, at most, four sites over 40 ha; the majority of other settlements rarely exceeded 10 ha in extent. From one perspective, cult practice in Archaic/ Classical times does seem to be linked to the polis. Urban and suburban sanctuaries are clearly attested at Eleutherna, Axos, Prinias, Knossos, Gortys, Dreros, Azoria (Pachlitzani Agriada), Praisos and Itanos.65 If we follow De Polignac's 'Argive' model, then we should also find major rural sanctuaries with clear links 59 As argued convincingly by Duplouy (2006, esp. 190-203). See also Whitley 2009. 60 Perlman 2004a. 61 Whitelaw 2004 — though this figure may, if anything, have to be revised upwards in the light of the recent survey; see Whitelaw and Morgan 2009, 94-6; Evely 2010, 183-4. Wallace (2010a, 233-53) argues that a major phase of nucleation occurred in Crete in the late 10th to 9th centuries BC, and it is this period (and not later) that marks a step change with the situation in LM IIIB/IIIC Crete. Some of the more detailed evidence for this (which is capable of a different construction) is presented in Wallace 201 Oh. 62 See discussion in Schnapp 1994 (Eleutherna); Whitley et al. 1999, 218-20 (Praisos). 63 Haggis 2005, 131-3; Haggis et al. 2004, 2007. 64 Haggis 2005, 131-3. 65 Knossos: Prent 2004; 2005, 259-63; Eleutherna, Axos and Prinias: Prent 2005, 244-59; Gortys: Prent 2005, 265-76; Dreros, Prent 2005, 283-9; Pachlitzani Agriada: Haggis 2005, 137; Prent 2005, 299-300; sanctuaries in and around Praisos: Whitley 2008; Prent 2005, 302-9; Itanos: Prent 2005, 309-10.</page><page sequence="9">DIFFERENTIAL COMPLEXITIES 339 to particular poleis. But here the evidence is ambiguous. A case can be made for linking Kommos to Phaistos, and the sanctuary of Zeus Thenatas at Amnisos to Knossos. But the location of the cave sanctuaries at Ida and Psychro, the situation of Symi almost equidistant from the weak (and poorly understood) communities of Malla and Biennos66 and the position of the sanctuary of Dictaean Zeus at Palaikastro between Itanos and Praisos follows no clear political logic.67 Or, to put it another way, if we ask the question 'which polis controlled the Idaean Cave' the answer is probably 'none'. Some of these sanctuaries may have, at some date from the 6th century BC onwards, been incorporated into the territories of poleis, but in few cases, and certainly not in those of the cave sanctuaries or Symi, can such rural sanctuaries have originated with the polis. When it comes to literacy, it is clear that by 500 BC at the latest the new 'technology of the intellect' that the Greek alphabet represented was being used in the service of the polis. Official writing, in the form of laws or even law codes inscribed on stone, have been found at Eleutherna, Axos, Prinias, Phaistos, Gortys, Knossos, Eltynia, Lyktos, Dreros and (probably) Praisos.68 The Spensithios inscription attests that many cities (in this case 'Datalla') also had official scribes (poinikastas) whose job it was to record and remember public matters, both human and divine.69 Crete is also notable for its disproportionately large number of official, monumental inscriptions, and its relative dearth of informal or votive epigraphy. Public inscriptions however clearly indicate a degree of social, political and economic complexity, particularly evident at Gortys and Eleutherna.70 These inscriptions regulate both politics — in the terms of office of the kosmoi of Dreros — and economics — in the case of pasturage rights around Lyktos.71 They regulate but, unlike documents in the earlier Hieroglyphic and Linear scripts, they do not administer. Administration is left to the public officials of the Cretan oligarchies, chiefly the kosmoi ('regulators'). Commensality seemed to form an important part of the organisation of these polis communities. Later literary evidence records a peculiar Cretan institution, the andreion, also attested in Archaic inscriptions from Eltynia, Axos, Gortys and 'Dattalla'.72 In the andreion, male citizens of the polis dined together — and the sources are clear that the purpose of this dining was to reinforce bonds of solidarity (and equality) within the restricted body of male citizens. For over a hundred years, scholars have been trying to identify the institution with a recognisable architectural form. Can didates have included small buildings with armour from Dreros and Afrati; it has been suggested that the hearth temples of Prinias, Dreros and Kommos may have been 'multi-functional', serving as both temples and andreia. The quest to identify buildings as andreia perhaps misses the point, especially if we want to understand the politics of commensality. Some clarification is needed about forms of commensality in the wider Greek world. In Archaic and Classical poleis on the Greek mainland, two main types of commensality can be identified. The first is the feasts that accompany festivals and sacrifices to the gods, where the participants, rather in the manner of a modern Greek panigyri, consume the meat from domestic animals that does not get burnt on the altar (i.e. most of the actual meat). The portions distributed in Athens were deliberately 'equal' — rank distinctions between participants were underplayed. Such sacrificial feasts can however be fitted in to Dietler's 'patron role' category, provided we remember that the patron is the god, and the participants his or her guests. Sacrificial feasting serves to reinforce rank distinctions, but rank distinctions between the human and divine, not between humans.73 The other principal form of semi-public commensality was the symposium — originally a private gathering of men of high but more or less equal status. The symposium is the locus classicus of diacritical feasting, marked out by its own very special rules of etiquette and by a particular style of food, furniture, dress and dining and drinking vessels (centred upon the mixing bowl or krater). Mainland symposia are highly self-referential — symposium vessels, especially the krater, are decorated either with mythological scenes, or with scenes that seem to make jokes about wine and its consumption.74 Such mainland patterns cannot however be mapped directly onto Crete. We do have evidence of major meat consumption at some sanctuaries — analysis of the animal bones from Kommos and the sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos testifies to that.75 But any iconography connected to Cretan symposia seems to vanish from the archaeological record in Crete from the 7th century onwards. Sixth century kraters exist, but for the most part (that is, with two exceptions) they are plain Laconian stirrup kraters. Drinking vessels exist, but for the most part they are again plain necked 66 Prent 2005, 342-8. 67 Prent 2005, 350-2, 532-50. 68 As one of us has argued: Whitley 1997, 2005. 69 Jeffery and Morpurgo Davies 1970. 70 Perlman 2002 and 20046 respectively. The process of monumentalisation of the law culminates in the Gortyn Law Code (see Willetts 1967). 71 For Dreros, see Demargne and Van Effenterre 1937; for Lyktos, Van Effenterre and Van Effenterre 1985. 72 The whole question is fully discussed by Prent (2005, 441 76; 2007); for the claimed 'andreion' at Azoria, with discussion, see Haggis et al. 2004, 387-90. 73 See now Ekroth 2008. 74 As argued brilliantly by Lissarrague (1990). 75 See Coldstream 1973 for Knossos; Shaw and Shaw 2000 for Kommos.</page><page sequence="10">340 CHRISTINA HATZIMICHAEL AND JAMES WHITLEY cups.76 Evidence for some kind of'diacritical feasting' has however turned up at Azoria, where bio archaeological analysis allows us to compare the kinds of food being prepared in purely domestic and in civic contexts.77 Each context seems to be associated with distinctive kinds of food preparation. In the civic contexts, such food preparation is connected to a ceramic assemblage that derives from the mainland symposium — with krater stands (but not fineware kraters), Cretan necked cups and some imported vessels. Though there is some iconography, it is much poorer than in contemporary deposits from, say, the Athenian Agora. It is a plainer version of the symposium, adapted to Cretan needs and in a more public setting than the contemporary mainland. Perhaps here we have the andreion. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Taking our four variables, this is the preliminary sketch we have made for our three main (and one subsidiary) periods. In Protopalatial Crete, a few settlements — Malia in particular—become very large (over 40 ha). Though most other, non-palatial sites are very much smaller, a functional site hierarchy is not evident. The numerous rural cults on peaks, by springs and in caves that appear at this time are not, for the most part, clearly connected to palaces. In some cases, ceramic evidence indicates that diacritical feasting took place in two palace sites (Malia and Knossos), though such practices do not seem to be confined to palaces. Administrative practices are diverse in form and relatively small in scale, and seem to operate more on a household than a state level. If we want to call the polities based around Malia, Phaistos, Knossos and Petras 'states', they were states which exercised limited control either over the entire economy or over cult. Our conclusions therefore generally support the broadly 'revisionist' view of Protopalatial polities put forward by Knappett, Schoep and Hamilakis. The Neopalatial picture is, to be sure, one of greater centralisation, and greater cultural homogeneity, influenced from Knossos. The case for state control however remains weak and, as in earlier times, a diverse range of political forms must have existed across the island. Certain areas may always have been outside state control, and certain settlements may have had varying degrees of autonomy. The case for unitary, strongly centralised states seems to us to be weak. The LMIIIB-IIIC picture is curious. The largest sites (Knossos among them) contract in size to a maximum of 8 ha, 4-6 ha being the median for the larger sites across the island. Literacy and literate administration disappears. New forms of cult — the bench shrine — and new forms of 'diacritical' commensality, focussed around the krater, develop and flourish. In both cases, the island-wide cultural uniformity is remarkable, suggesting a high-level of island wide interaction. States cannot have existed, but communities with asymmetrical social and political relations clearly did. By 400 BC, there can be no doubt that states had emerged across much of the island. These (for the most part) polis states were structured around the principle of elite male solidarity; writing was used to regulate and to monumentalise, but not to administer. Several forms of 'political' commensality co-existed — the austere Cretan variant on the symposium (the andreion) representing 'diacritical' feasting that reinforced the distinctions between the male, citizen elite and the rest of the population. State 'control' over cult however remained limited, some major sanctuaries, particularly the Idaean Cave, having little to do with any one particular state. Several broader conclusions can be drawn from this picture. First, asymmetrical social and political relations (and so elites) must have existed from at least Prepalatial times. This does not imply that we are dealing with a stratified society.78 Protopalatial, Neopalatial and indeed LM IIIB-IIIC hierarchies are more likely to have been ranked, even if 'heterarchies' are only ever likely to have existed in Protopalatial times. Second, in both Protopalatial and Neopalatial times political diversity is more likely than not. Relative uniformity in political forms (the polis) is a feature of the late Archaic/early Classical period, and may have its roots in the relative cultural homogeneity of LM IIIC times. Third, strongly centralised, unitary states, with stratified social hierarchies, are the exception rather than the rule in Cretan history. Only at two points do such states clearly emerge: in Final Palatial times, at Rnossos and (perhaps) Chania; and in early Classical times, at Gortys, Lyktos, Knossos and Eleutherna. Early Classical times saw the incorporation of smaller autonomous settlements (Prinias and Azoria) into larger poleis (Gortys and Hierapytna respectively). Of the two state forms that did emerge in Crete, it is the Gortys of the monumental Law Code and not the shadowy kingdoms of Minos or Idomeneus that has left a lasting legacy in the ancient world. 76 Erickson 2010, esp. 329, table 2, and Whitley 2009, 285, tables 14.4—14. 5 provide some figures. 77 Haggis et al. 2004, 2007. 78 Sensu Fried 1967.
