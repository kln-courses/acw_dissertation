<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. RELATION OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS.* Good books on this subject are needed both by the laity and the ministry. Prevailing opinions upon it in the church are either vague or erroneous. Many have no definite idea at all of the nature of the relation of the religion of Israel to Christianity; and, to many, the relation is simply one of contrast or opposition. Dr. Gardiner has, therefore, done a real service to the church in his late work* on this subject. Clear and simple in style, it is fitted to be used and understood by any intelligent layman; and, at the same time, it presents the views of the latest and best scholarship, both on the orthodox side, and on that of the " higher criti- cism," in regard to the matters of which it treats. The method of treatment is the following: In Lectures I. and II., it is shown that Revelation is both a unit and progressive, and that, therefore, the New Testament forms with the Old one great whole, of which each is an essential part. In this whole, the New Testa- ment is, however, an immense advance (p. 51) upon the Old, while not less on this account is it the complement of the latter, and characterized by the same funda- mental principles and purpose. The differences between the two " all result from the application of these [common] principles to different people at different times and under different conditions " (p. 27). It is then shown, in Lecture III., "that the Old Testament was given for the purpose of preparing for the New" (p. 62). "The New was cradled in the Old, and sprang out of it by a long designed and divine evolution " (p. 78). Thus it is shown, in these Lectures I.- III., that the Old Testament history, religion, and institutions, (1) were the divinely ordained means of that education necessary for the understanding of the New Dispensation, (2) that they prepared the way for it, and (3) that they, as well as the direct predictions of the prophets, more or less pointed forward to it as the coming completion. After establishing these points on general grounds, our author shows, in Lectures IV.-XI., how these ends were secured in the case of special elements in the Old Testament and the Old Testament Religion. This ex- amination serves to confirm the conclusion already reached in the three first chap- ters, by making the argument a cumulative one. The elements thus examined are (1) The National, Educational, Typical, and Preparatory Precepts of the Law (Lecture IV.); (2) The Sacrifices (V.); (3) The Priesthood (VI.); (4) The Theo- cratic Government of Israel (VII.); (5) The Old Testament Predictions of the Future (VlII.); (6) The Types of the Old Testament (IX.-XI.). In the lectures next following (XII.-XIV.), our author has to do with the manner in which the Old Testament is treated by the writers of the New. He here shows (1) That the New Testament use of certain passages of the Old does not, in the least, necessi- tate our supposing any "Double Sense " in the Old Testament language (XII.); (2) What is the nature of the New Testament testimony to the authorship of the Old Testament books (XIII); (3) How the New Testament writers use the Old in quoting from it for purposes of argument, or as containing expressions of general truth common to all time, or for the purpose of illustration, or merely using its words as sacred and familiar forms of expression, without regard to their original use (XIV.). In the final lecture (XV.), we are shown what are some of the neces- sary inferences in regard to the nature of the Scriptures, which follow from the unity of the two Dispensations. * THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS IN THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONS. By Frederic Gardiner, D. D., Professor in the Berkely Divinity Sehool. New York: James Pott &amp; Co., 1885. Cloth, $1.50. 44</page><page sequence="2">BOOK NOTICES. In the course of the arguments, subjects are naturally presented and treated, which have not been suggested by the brief sketch just given of the contents of the book. Thus, for example, in treating of the Unity of the Old and New Testa- ments, when showing that the differences between them are not inconsistent with their essential unity, the subject of the anthropomorphic language of the Old Testament is clearly and well handled. Again, in showing that the Old Testament was preparatory for the New, the matter of the sins and imperfections of the saints and heroes of the Old Testament time, is fairly, skillfully and successfully disposed of. These examples may serve to show the wide range of the discussion, and how the difficulties of Old Testament interpretation are allowed a proper place in it, without being in the least avoided. The book is not unworthy of its author. The method is scholarly; the dis- tinctions are almost always clear, and, when clear, uniformly just ; the exegesis is sensible and scientific; and the conclusions, in the main, are sound and true. Of course, in so wide a range of examination, it is not to be expected that every exegesis will command universal assent. It would be strange, too, if every part of the reasoning seemed conclusive to every reader. As examples of what seem to be unconvincing argumentations, may be cited the reasoning on pp. 40-42 (cf. what is said on p. 30) and that on pp. 63-67. It is not intended, however, to imply that the conclusion reached, in either of these cases, is not true. It sometimes happens also, in the reviewer's judgment, that important dis- tinctions are not clearly made. For example, clearness and force would be gained by distinguishing carefully between the two Dispensations and the two Testa- ments, and treating separately of the relation between the two in each case. For it is most important to have clearly in mind, in a discussion of this sort, that Revelation and Scripture are not synonymous terms; but that one is the fact, and the other the record and the interpretation. Another case of the lack of clear dis- tinctions is to be found in the treatment of the matter of Types. The definition adopted, "a foreshadowing example," is well enough in itself, but it leads, and leads almost inevitably, to a confusion, in the treatment, of types with symbols, and with " prophetic institutions " (p. 177) and " prophetic history " (p. 199). If one should make a general criticism on so good a book, he might express a regret that the argument for the essential unity of the Old and the New Dispen- sation is made to rest so largely on the ritualistic and predictive elements of the Old Testament Religion, rather than on its moral and spiritual elements. For, whatever may be true, or not true, in regard to the order in time of the Penta- teuchal legislation and the prophetic teaching, it is clear that the Old Testament itself treats the ritualistic and predictive elements of the religion it teaches, not as central, but as subordinate, and as occupying, so to speak, a side position. Dr. Gardiner may, however, have been influenced, in the selection of his method of argument, by the central position which the great sacrifice and the priesthood of Christ hold in the Christian system. But this must be radically different, in any view of the matter, from the place held by sacrifice and priest under the Old Dispensation. This, indeed, is clear from Dr. Gardiner's own treatment of the subject. A Good Index of Texts is to be found at the close of the volume; but an Index of Subjects would add to the usefulness of the book. It may be said, too, that it is worthy of a better binding than the publishers have given it. 45</page></plain_text>
