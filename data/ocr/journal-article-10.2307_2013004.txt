AUGUST 1, 1912 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS THE CONCEPTION OF " SOUL" THE evolution of the idea of a "soul" is one of the most inter- esting and curious chapters in the history of human thought, having an enormous influence not only upon our religious, but also upon our philosophical and scientific, conceptions. As this develop- ment is especially pertinent to some matters under current discus- sion, I present some reader's notes on the topic-with no thought, of course, that my sketch is more than provisional. I (a) As the "Life. "-Australian Blacks and Zandeh Negroes alike believe that nobody dies a natural death (and see to it that this is usually the case, being energetic cannibals!). The life is purely physical; by eating the body one absorbs the life. But corpses are realities; the life is separable from the body: hence this separable life is an entity by itself; it is a soul. Of course, plants and animals, as well as men, have souls of this sort. This, in general, is the funda- mental animistic notion. (b) As the "Life-Blood. "-The separable soul is naturally-and, where the mind is incapable of abstract ideas, necessarily-thought of as a physical or material substance. For obvious reasons, one of the earliest and most inalienable identifications is of soul and life- blood. Our very phrase "life-blood"; the notion of its physical perpetuation in "consanguinity," "of the blood"; the notion of its transmission in "blood brotherhood"-all point to this primitive identification. The blood is "the fountain of life." Plutarch states that pre- vious to the reign of Psammetichus the Egyptian priests were unused to drink wine, or even to offer it in libation to the gods, for they regarded it as the blood of those who had warred against the gods; which, falling to earth and mixing therewith, became the seed of vines. It is on account of this, said the Egyptians, that drunkenness drives men mad, they being, so to speak, filled with the life-blood of 421</page><page sequence="2">422 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY their ancestors. This is an obvious explanation of the hurtfulness of "wine when it is red," of its sacramental vicariousness, of the divine possession of the Dionysiac. A more primitive and explicit idea is that which Berosus states as held in Chaldeea, that all life, human and animal, is derived from the blood of a decapitated deity mixed with clay-which recalls the whole group of myths in which procreation of life follows bloody mutila- tion. It accounts also for such tabus as are apparent in "kosher" slaughter: "But flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof, ye shall not eat." The Arabs speak of "the life" that flows forth upon the spear-point; and we still have the saying that "blood calls for vengeance. " Says King James ("Daemonology"): " In a secret murther, if the dead carcass be at any time thereafter handled by the murtherer, it will gush out of blood, as if the Blood were crying to Heaven for revenge of the murtherer." (c) As the "Breath of Life." -Gen. ii. 7: "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." Many of the words meaning "soul" are derivatives from roots signifying "breath,"" wind." Such are Hebrew nephesh, Greek kvXy1, wvvev/a Latin spiritus, anima. The derivation offered for am, are, present of be, from a root meaning "breathe," is interesting in this connection. The invisibility, intangibility, fleetness, and ubiquity of the soul are naturally associated with this conception-perhaps as primitive as any. (d) As Wind, Smoke, Fire.-Closely associated with the pre- ceding is the body of analogies drawn from air and fire. "He opened the earth, and the spirit of Eabani he caused to rise up like a wind" (Jastrow's translation). This simile from the Babylonian epic literature recalls the Jinni of the "Arabian Nights" issuing from the flask in the form of a smoky cloud. In Beowulf the crema- tion of a hero is described gi'th-rinc a'stah, "the hero ascended"; and it is quite possible that the conception underlying cremation is that the smoke of the consumed body bears the spirit aloft, as the smoke of the burnt-offering bears the savor of life to the divinity. At all events, the flammule, nimbi, haloes, and the like, which in Occident and Orient denote spiritual endowment, are an obvious indication of a primarily material conception of the soul. (e) As Shade, or Shadow.-Egyptian chaibit, Greek o-Ka4, Latin umbra, like the Zulu zitunzela (from izitunzi, shadows), are all terms illustrative of the idea that the man's shadow is his soul, cur- rent in European poetry since Homer, though with Homer less a figure of speech than a description of spiritual reality. (f) As Phantasm.-The notion of the soul as a shadow is the</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENT'IFIC METHODS 423 natural precursor-aided, no doubt, by dream images and hallucina- tions-of the conception of a phantasmal duplicate of the body, visible, but normally intangible, and evanescent. The phantasmic soul is often a manikin, though it may be an exaggeration of the physical form. The Greek Ela&amp;coXo, Latin simulacrum, the English fetch, wraith, doubleganger (respectively of Celtic, Norse, and Scottish origins, I believe) are instances. So also is the "astral body" of the theosophists. The ghost, though originally like the Greek ix p, probabiy "the one who tears, wounds," is currently con- ceived as spectral and phantasmic in his visitations. II (a) Soul and Body.-Thus is developed the conception of a being closely associated with the body, intervolved with bodily life, yet detachable from the body- "hospes comes que corporis." The Papuans "all believe that within them resides an invisible other self, or spirit, which, if it occasionally wanders for a hurried tour from its home in the hours of sleep, goes forth for good at death, to hover for some period at least round the scenes of its embodied life before departing for some lone island or inaccessible summit. " Zulu souls "may occupy the roof of a man's hut, and if he changes his abode his soul flits also." It is the Fijian (if my memory serves) who secretes his soul at home as a precaution for his own safe return from battle. And so on ad infinitum. The whole man is the union of body and soul-the life, or the spirit, incarnate; and each of the two elements suffers in power from the separation. This is the normal view, and certainly the primitive one. But as ideas magnify, each of these elements assumes its own special importance. The relative importance of the bodily element and the unimpor- tance, or at least inefficiency, of the spiritual, is the elder notion. The discarnate soul is naked and shivering, lacking the warmth of life- "Errant exangues sine corpore et ossibus umbrae." At death "the spirit flies forth like a dream," says the mother of Odysseus; it is sinewless and fleeting, and even its voice is reduced to mumblings and mouthings; the shades are "gibbering shades" and the "ghostly voice" is only a fainting replica of human utterance- "And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets," is Shakespeare's phrase. The Scandinavian "little people" are souls awaiting their turn to be clothed in human flesh; and the whole notion of metempsychosis is founded upon the incredibility-ethic-</page><page sequence="4">424 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ally, at least-of a lastingly disembodied life: it could do nothing for the world, and so is unthinkable. The ineffectiveness of disembodiment seems to extend even to superhuman beings. At all events, the blood offering is best to be explained as an effort to nourish the immaterial "spirit" with the more substantial "life." "I took the sheep," says Odysseus, "and cut their throats over the trench, and the dark blood flowed forth, and lo, the spirits of the dead that be departed gathered them from out of Erebus." Neoptolemus, in offering Polyxena to the shade of Achilles (Euripides, "Hecuba"), cries: "Drink the maiden's blood, black and unmixed!" The pursuing Furies, in the "Eumenides," "delight in the odor of man's blood"-their vital nourishment. A higher grade of respect for spiritual power, at least in its con. junctive augmentation of the bodily, appears in the group of beliefs which concede the possession of a proper soul only to the more effi- cient persons. The Negresses of Darfur are forbidden to eat liver, because they have no souls. A Basoga chief, pointing at a peasant, exclaims: "He have an immortal soul! I can not believe it; but I will admit that perhaps Wakoli or Luba had a soul. Wakoli had four hundred wives! " Among some Polynesians only the nobles are believed to possess souls. We recall the reassurance of the pirates in "Treasure Island": "Nobody minds Ben Gunn, dead or alive, nobody minds him." The power of the spirit is more distinctly recognized in the con- ception of it as a guardian spirit which hovers about the body, or appears at necessity to render aid. The genius of the Roman is the type of such a being, exemplified again in the fravashi, who looks after the interests of the Persian "in the presence of Ormazd"- very much, we may suppose, as the Fijian's soul preserves him from battle danger. It is but a step from this idea to that of the soul's superior power and worth, which is the root of the ascetic despisal of the body. The body becomes "the spirit's house" or "the garment of flesh" and is misused accordingly. The Egyptian priests, according to Plutarch, avoided fatness for the reason that they wished their bodies to sit lightly and easily about the soul, not pressing upon and weighing down the immortal and divine with a merely mortal part. This is but the material root of the later idea of the soul as a prisoner of the flesh to be set free at death. (b) Survival of Bodily Death.-A soul which is first conceived as separable from the body, later as hardly more than accidentally con- nected with the body, and finally as the essential, but independent cause of bodily life, can not but be conceived as surviving bodily decay. Some, to be sure, have conceived the soul to survive the</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 425 death, but not the destruction of the body. This appears to have been a Stoic notion-the soul being held to survive, on an irrational plane, until the body was entirely resolved into its elements. Theosophists of our own day hold some such notion in regard to the phantasmal soul which they recognize. And it must be confessed that there is a kind of ghastly plausibility of this view in the appar- ently decaying personalities of some of the mediumistic communica- tions of the research societies. Nevertheless, advance in civilization has, on the whole, been attended by the development of more refined and convincing conceptions, founded upon ethical rather than material reasons. And it has been the affair of the science of psy- chology to give content to the more advanced ideas of spiritual being. (c) "Anthropology."-Both the spectacle of a lifeless body and the belief in a living, though soulless body, or in a bodiless, though inefficient soul, lead to the conception of a complete man combining body and soul. The science of man's nature, in this full sense, the Schoolmen named "anthropology," leaving "psychology" as the branch concerned with the analysis of the soul's life alone. The most primitive type of such an anthropology is that formed by combining the various conceptions of soul, almost universally developed, with the idea of the body, the name, and such other notions as center in a personality. Thus the Indian prophet Keokuk instructed his followers to pray for the heart, the flesh, the life, the name, the family. The Persians distinguished in man the body, the life, the soul, the form, the genius; and the Egyptians-who seem never to have relinquished an idea, no matter how primitive, once it had gained a mental hold-analyzed the personality of the deceased into mummy, genius, bird-soul, heart, form, shadow, soul, strength, name, assigning separate destinies and longevities to these numerous divisions. The ethical conception of a good and a bad inner nature in each individual is often hypostatized, giving two souls in place of two dispositions-a sort of Jekyll and Hyde double personality. Even Plato can say, "there are two souls, a good and an evil"; while the Bagobos are said to carry this idea to the picturesque extreme of con- signing the good soul to Heaven, the bad to Hell, in the dissociation which the future world is to bring about. (d) The Partitive Soul.-From this plurality of souls it is only a natural step to regard the soul as divided into a nu.mber of fairly distinct parts. In our own popular thought there is frequently an entitative distinction between Soul, Spirit, Mind, and Consciousness; and it is to be doubted if the mass of men have outpassed Purchas's conception of the soul as "conflate of the Mind, Spirit, and Animal Soul, or Idolum. "</page><page sequence="6">426 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Certainly the strong hold which the old-time " faculty " psy- chology still retains even upon scientific text-books and treatises, compartmentalizing perception, emotion, volition, reason, etc., is palpable evidence of the vitality of this primitive way of thinking. Nor can it be denied that the physiological analysis of experience given by the "Five Wits," which the miracle plays loved to per- sonify, is in itself a somewhat powerful and striking support to the compartmental mode of conceiving mental life; while in our own day the curious and complicated phenomena of multiple personality have given a semi-scientific ratification of old-fashioned beliefs in multiple entities connected with the same body. III Philosophic Conceptions.-The earliest efforts to analyze philo- sophically the nature of the soul, the earliest psychologies, are as inefficient as the early attempts to analyze nature, committing the same error of carrying simplification to absurdity. Thus for Anaxi- menes the soul is air; for Heracleitus, fire; for the Atomists, a wraith of fine and impalpable atoms; for Empedocles, the blood about the heart-all conceptions at once related to the ontologies of these thinkers and to the primitive conceptions from which their thought had developed. There is a slight advance in the Pythagorean notion of the soul as a harmony; but it is only with Plato that we attain anything like a scientific psychology. Plato regarded the soul as immaterial and as partaking of the nature and divinity of ideas. It is related to the body as is har- mony to the lyre-apparently the Pythagorean notion. Its faculties are reason, understanding, faith, perception. Here we have the gen- eral conception of an entity endowed with faculties, which is the model of most later thinking. Aristotle merely elaborates the Platonic view. A living being is a composite of soul and body, the soul being its formal, the body its material, cause. Soul is the "actuality" of life, it is "the entelechy of a natural body endowed with the capacity of life." Its powers are (1) nutritive or vegetative, (2) perceptive, (3) creative or kinetic, (4) rational or dianoetic. In every organism it is a unit, but it is found in every part of the body. Aristotle here, as elsewhere, sets the detailed model for the work of centuries; what follows is but minute elaboration of his plans. Says Burton: "According to Aristotle, the soul is defined to be e'reXe'eta, perfectio et actus primus corporis organici, vitam habentis in potentia; the perfection or first act of an organical body, having power of life, which most philosophers approve. But many</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 427 doubts arise about the essence, subject, seat, distinction, and sub- ordinate faculties of it." "The common division," Burton continues, "is into three prin- cipal faculties-vegetal, sensitive, and rational, which make three distinct kinds of living creatures-vegetal plants, sensible beasts, rational men. How these three principal faculties are distinguished and connected, Humano ingenio inaccessum videtur, is beyond human capacity." Nevertheless, it has not been beyond human speculation. Augustine described the soul as simple, immaterial, spiritual, devoid of quantity or space. He distinguished in it the lower sensu- ous and appetitive faculties from the higher volitional and cognitive; and he made it immortal because it is the repository of imperishable truth. To this the Schoolmen added little except pedantry. Body and soul, according to Aquinas, are coprinciples of the substantial unit which is man, being related as matter and form (Aristotle). Man is defined: substantia singularis rattionalis integra tota in se et sui juris. The soul is locomotive, nutritive, sensitive, rational (Aristotle once more) ; with the rational soul as the dominant and immortal part: anima intellectiva est forma corporis, sed non qua intellectiva. Sir John Davies's poem, "Of the Soul," in which he reduces psychology to rhyme, serves up the general hotch-potch in a series of powers which almost rivals Burton, but is better than Burton's analysis in that it reflects more persistent notions. The soul's powers he finds to be the vegetative, those of the "five senses" and that of the "common sense," fantasy, sense memory, passions, powers of movement, intellect, abstraction, reason-almost a modern phrenol- ogy. But the real problem is not the analysis, but the spacelessness and at the same time the ubiquity of the soul, and this Sir John resolves with a verbal dexterity that would do credit to the modern absolutistic application of the similar notion to the soul of the universe- "So doth the piercing soul the body fill, Being all in all, and all in part diffused." "Others make a doubt," says Burton, "whether it be all in all, and all in every part." But Davies has the tradition back of him, and that is better than intelligibility. He is a fair prophet of Fechner, defining the soul as "the whole unitary spiritual process in conjunc- tion with the whole unitary bodily process." Fechner is largely the founder of our most modern psychology- but not on the basis of this definition. The truth is that modern philosophy and psychology alike have largely ceased to be concerned with the "soul." Psychology has chosen the more phenomenal</page><page sequence="8">428 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY region of mind, or latterly, of consciousness for its province; and while it has sceptically hinted that there may be no ens spirituale behind or beneath or beside mind and consciousness, it has mainly left the matter to the safer handling of theologians. Where it is at all frank, it treats the brain as the sole substratum and support of conscious life. This is to be understood of physiological psychology, for which consciousness is merely a bodily habit, or of psycho- physics, which sees in mental phenomena merely a convenient index to experimentation. I think a fair-as well as a shrewd-statement of the modern view is that given by Professor Singer:1 "We are barely through those long chapters in the history of science in which the theory of a hot body composed that object of a body plus heat. This heat was first conceived as itself a kind of body-a congeries of small, round atoms; then, since heat did not increase the mass to which it was added, it became the vaguer stuff called caloric. Nevertheless, however ghostly this caloric had be- come, it still went in and out of bodies like a stuff, fell under the same principles of individuation that bodies fall under, was in short a sort of body, though a mysterious sort of body. We know with what travail this strong, primitive instinct to add was overcome, and men had the courage to say, 'Heat is not something inferred from the heated behavior of a body, it is that behavior.' . . . "As a hot body is a body plus heat, so a living body is a carcass plus life. The history of this conception is strikingly like that of the previous one. At first the thing added to body to make it alive was another body-the psyche-differing, may be, in certain of its qualities, but still falling under the same principles of individuation, having a history of its own when disembodied. Now, this psyche is reduced where it survives at all to that vague principle called 'the vital,' of which all that can be said is that it is a mystery. Few thinkers cling to this survival; for most of us a living body is a mechanism that behaves in a certain way, one that is well calculated to attain certain ends. Life is no longer a thing to be inferred from behavior; it is behavior, and while it is an aspect of a body's be- havior from which other aspects may be distinguished, we no longer think of these aspects as separate. Disembodied life has been placed among the myths. " IV Bodily and Spiritual Life.-The net result of the conceptual development traced is thus negative. It reminds one of Burton 's anecdote in regard to the discussion of the soul's immortality before rhiS JOURNAL, Vol. VIII., pages 185-6.</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 429 Leo X.: "That Epicurean pope, as some record of him, caused this question to be discussed pro and con before him, and concluded at last, as a profane and atheistical moderator, with that verse of Cor- nelius Gallus, Et redit in nihilum, quod fuit ante nihil." So our analysis shows the conception of soul to begin and end in mythic hypostatization. Nevertheless this result is mainly an appearance due to the essen- tial cloudiness of abstract thinking. The process has been one of abstraction and reification from the first; coupled, in the more ele- mentary stage, with an identification of the abstracted and reified "life" with some such concrete symbol as the breath or the blood. The "soul, the "psyche," is an ideal emblem, useful in the analysis of experience, but certainly not designating any legitimate non- experiential entity. What it properly means is a kind of fact as simple and direct as any that we know-the fact of personality. This personality consists in something more than "bodily be- havior," even while it is "incarnate" in the body with which it is objectively associated. For "behavior" and "body" represent ab- stractions of experience quite as emblematic as is "soul." Indeed, if we assume the personal, or shall I say possessional attitude toward experience, which is characteristic of philosophy as the impersonal attitude is characteristic of science, then we make rather better sense in speaking of the body as the mind's "behavior" than vice versa;2 for the body is only one among the multitude of "things" which the mind's activity generates-or, if you are a realist, identifies. Of course "the mind," too, is one of these "things"; and so we are brought through the whole circuit of abstractions without any rest in the elusive reality. But this is the general fate of thinking. The truth is that all our descriptions of life have to be from some point of view-and that an artificial, or at least an arbitrary one. If we happen to be ontologically minded we will think with the Greeks and the Schoolmen in terms of substance and attribute, and soul and body will each be an ens, whose function is to have and whose nature is to be. If we are of a more recent turn we will psy- chologize experience. The German mode of doing this is primitive and anthropomorphic, but with a peculiar bent, the parent of which is the "faculty psychology." Thus it is that Fichte makes the will -the moral and enlightened will-into the moving cause and the essence of the universe. For Schelling, sensation and imagination set the model. Hegel makes the reason the proper being of all. Schopenhauer, like Fichte, utilizes volition, only Schopenhauer uses a blind and unintelligent will. In each case we have a "faculty" artificially created by psychological analysis erected into the founda- 2As witness Strong's "Why the Mind Has a Body."</page><page sequence="10">430 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tion for all the other facts of experience. The characteristic exag- geration of the procedure is nowhere better shown than in a com- parison of Fichte and Schopenhauer, each of whom succeeds in cre- ating a universe to his taste by the simple expedient of broadening or contracting the scope of the faculty (the abstraction) which he has chosen to regard as basic. The whole operation is in kind exactly like that of the savage who places the life in the blood. Nor is the phenomenalistic, or naturalistic, mode of analysis any nearer the facts. When physiological science gives us a "body" as the core of certain "behaviors" we have simply taken old facts from a new point of view. The character of what we have been accus- tomed to term mental facts is not altered by the new name. The name does, to be sure, give a certain connotation of evanescence and destructibility to the facts, which the older terminology lacks-and this, of course, is the reason for its introduction; but it does not alter the facts nor interfere with other interpretations. For example, entirely intelligible may be that view of life which finds the founda- tion of its continuity in personality, as life constructs it, rather than in either a perishable body or an entitative soul. Many of our facts, and indeed most of those we care for, are not bodily facts, and are only incidentally associated with the bodily facts. This must not be taken to mean that we have a "dark" history concurrent with our conscious "light," founded upon some dim ulterior being. It means rather that the moments of light, which are the moments of what we call reality, are creative moments whose content and achievement far transcend bodily relations and possibilities. Continuing life means simply continuing experience, and analysis of experience, as in the body we know it, indubitably reveals a more than bodily element which we are justified in terming the spiritual element. For men will continue to speak and think in the categories of sub- stance and attribute, rest and motion, body and mind, thing and behavior. Generations of practical use have proven the value of these categories: they are simplifications, abstractions, and hence temporary falsifications of fact; but the experience of mankind cer- tainly shows that in the long run their employment leads to clarity and truth and to such general intelligibility as enables efficient living.
