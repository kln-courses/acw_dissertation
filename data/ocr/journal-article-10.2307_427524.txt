<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONTEXTUALIST DILEMMA-OR FALLACY? WALTER SUTTON Problems of critical theory, like those of theology, have an almost preter- natural capacity for renewal. Arguments which have been subjected to logical and empirical testing and utterly consumed emerge from the fires of contro- versy shining with a new splendor-the gloss of rhetorical artifice-verbally transfigured if not essentially transmuted. One such persistent problem is that of the referential as against the emotive or contextually-limited meaning of poetic language, a question given urgency for these times by the speculations of I. A. Richards in the mid-Twenties and subsequently by the contextualists among the New Critics. In the past few years the dilemma of a contextualist theory which at the same time makes cognitive claims for literature has continued to receive con- siderable attention. As Eliseo Vivas has commented, in an essay entitled "Literature and Knowledge," "How to explain the sense in which art embodies meanings which are not referential and are yet in some sense meaningful, and how to account for the mechanism by means of which it performs this feat, is a difficult problem which it is easy to overlook or to brush aside."1 It is a problem to which Murray Krieger has also addressed himself in a recent study of the New Criticism in which essentially the same question is posed: "How can poetry tell us something about our world that we can learn nowhere else when for the contextualist it is not in any obvious sense referential?"2 Although Mr. Krieger deals primarily with critics of poetry, while Mr. Vivas discusses the problem in relation to both prose fiction and verse, the dilemma is the same, and such terms as poem and novel or work may be considered interchangeable. The contemporary critics with whom Mr. Krieger is most immediately con- cerned include Cleanth Brooks, Allen Tate, and R. P. Warren, with Eliseo Vivas as aesthetician for the group.3 Of these, the most useful to Mr. Krieger as an illustration of the difficulties of the contextualist position is Cleanth Brooks, whose critical theory is seen as a development of key concepts derived from I. A. Richards. In his Principles of Literary Criticism (1925), Richards considered the function of poetry to be the efficient organization of manifold impulses or attitudes and advocated the criterion of complexity taken over by Brooks. Richards also provided Brooks with the idea of irony as a principle of structure, since he saw irony as the device which permitted the organization of opposing sets of impulses within the poem.4 Most relevant, however, to the dilemma of the later critics is the dichotomy which Richards imposed upon language in 'Creation and Discovery (New York, 1955), p. 107. 2 The New Apologists for Poetry (University of Minnesota Press, 1956), p. 192. 3 See Krieger, Chapter VIII, "The Transformation of Richards," pp. 123-139. The posi- tion of J. C. Ransom, the mentor of a number of these critics, is ambiguous; see below, note 11. 4 The Principles of Literary Criticism (London and New York, 1925), pp. 250-251. Cf. Brooks, The Well Wrought Urn (New York, 1947), pp. 191-192, 229-231. 219</page><page sequence="2">220 WALTER SUTTON his distinction between the scientific use of language, in which a "statement may be used for the sake of the reference, true or false, which it causes," and the emotive or poetic use "for the sake of the effects in emotion and attitude pro- duced by the reference it occasions."5 Although most of the contextualist critics do not profess to accept entirely the emotive theory of Richards, they continue to insist that the poetic context prevents the words in the poem from functioning referentially.6 In thus setting the contextually-controlled language of the poem apart from the language of prose, or science, the contextualists maintain a distinction comparable to that of Richards. In both Richards and the later contextualists the attitude toward language reflects an anti-science bias which may be viewed as a romantic and symbolist heritage. Although regarded in the Twenties as a leader of positivist criticism,7 Richards himself, in sharply distinguishing between the verifiable propositions of science and the "pseudo-statements" of emotive or poetic lan- guage,8 embraced a dualism comparable to the romantic distinction, as in Cole- ridge or Emerson, between the language of the rational understanding and that of the imaginative higher reason. Richards, however, disavowed the magical view of the world which supported the romantic intuitionist claim that the language of poetry provides not only truth but a higher truth, in the light of which the scientific truth of the understanding fades into the realm of illusion. For Richards in the mid-Twenties the poetic pseudo-statement was "true" only to the extent that, in the realm of beliefs and values, "it suits and serves some attitude or links together attitudes which on other grounds are desirable."9 Some of the critics, following Richards in accepting a basic distinction be- tween the language of poetry and that of science, have at the same time at- tempted to assert the cognitive status of poetry. In so doing they have often taken positions suggestive of the magical view of the world that the Richards of the Twenties considered outmoded. Even among contextualists who disclaim the supernaturalism of the nineteenth century (and their number is dwindling), the poem is conceived to be an inviolable, self-contained, organic whole which 5 The Principles of Literary Criticism, pp. 267-268. 6 Krieger points out that the contextualists (particularly Brooks, Tate, and R. P. Warren) do not accept the emotive claims of Richards and recognize that the referential aspect of language cannot be utterly neglected. Yet these critics still insist that the poetic context prevents individual words within the poem from functioning referentially. (The New Apologists, pp. 129-131.) Vivas also hews to this line, as the following statement indi- cates: "There are similarities between the work of literature and the world by means of which the work can tell us something about the world. But in spite of them the work obeys its own laws, so to speak, and does not refer to the world." (Creation and Discovery, p. 111.) 7 See Allen Tate, "Literature as Knowledge," The Man of Letters in the Modern World (New York, 1955), pp. 59 ff. Although Tate sees Richards as having come a long way from Science and Poetry in 1926 to Coleridge on Imagination in 1935, Richards' "later" position is actually implicit in the emotive-referential split with which he begins. It needed only a greater emphasis upon the idea of poetry as a necessary bulwark for belief and as a vehicle for myth, which is the "utterance of the whole soul of man," while science itself becomes seen as a kind of myth, to transform the "positivist" critic into a priest of the imagination. See Coleridge on Imagination (New York, 1935), p. 171. 8 Science and Poetry (New York, 1926), p. 70. 9 Ibid., p. 70.</page><page sequence="3">THE CONTEXTUALIST DILEMMA-OR FALLACY? 221 somehow conveys a truth distinct from the truth of science. Even though the truth of the poem is defined in such apparently-naturalistic terms as Tate's "knowledge of a whole object" and Ransom's knowledge of the world of "whole and indefeasible objects,"0l the critic's attitude is essentially the same as that of the romantic intuitionist in its assumption that the poem represents a system of values distinct from the values of experiential reality outside the poem. In its extreme form this attitude has the effect of cutting the poem off from criti- cism and even from the reader." The contextualist critic is thus left in a strad- dle, with one foot in the supposedly-inviolable world of the poem and the other in the world of common experience in which the poem is still somehow to repre- sent knowledge. This strained position the theorists are attempting to relieve, without conspicuous success. While it is true that the poet strives for unified structure and for the control of verbal meaning and value through context and while the contextualist em- phasis in criticism has been extremely helpful in directing inquiry toward the work itself, an arbitrary distinction between the language of poetry and that of science cannot be held without ignoring the actual nature of language. Al- though scientists and poets employ words differently for different purposes, the language which they use is common to them both,'2 as is whatever knowl- edge or truth the words may convey. This paper is written from the point of view that the truth of imaginative literature, like that of any linguistic for- mulation, is provisional and dependent upon the more or less exact test of experience and logical consistency. This point of view also assumes that the referential function of words-far from being alien to the poem or novel-ac- tually contributes to its aesthetic effect and to its formal integrity. II To establish an arbitrary distinction between the language of poetry and that of science is difficult, and the contextualists strive to avoid the appear- ance of dogmatism while maintaining an untenable position. Their strategy is effectively described by Mr. Krieger: These critics unanimously affirm that, while the words of a poem, considered atomisti- cally, may function referentially, the poetic structure of words, considered contextually, 10 Tate, The Man of Letters in the Modern World, p. 63; J. C. Ransom, The World's Body (New York, 1938), pp. x-xi. 11 Krieger also points out the implications of an "utterly self-contained poetic con- text ... cut off even from its potential reader" and invulnerable to criticism. (The New Apologists, p. 136.) In this connection, consider Ransom's idea of texture, in which the essence of poetry resides and which is distinct from the logical structure. See The New Criticism (Norfolk, Conn., 1941), pp. 219-220 and passim. The position of Ransom, as a contextualist, is ambiguous. In his emphasis upon logical structure he would seem to stand apart. In his emphasis upon the inviolability of the poem's irrelevant texture, which is impregnable to logical analysis, his attitude is comparable to that of the contextualist toward the poem as a whole. 12 Except, of course, when the scientist is using arbitrary counters or symbols. Morris Cohen points out, however, that "there is not a proposition in logic or mathematics that cannot be ultimately expressed in ordinary words (this is proved by the fact that these subjects can be taught to those who do not start with a knowledge of the special symbols)." (A Preface to Logic [New York, 1956], p. 22.)</page><page sequence="4">222 WALTER SUTTON prevents the individual words from so functioning. The poet knows the inherent danger in his medium: that words struggle to mean things. He must, by the formal context he imposes on them, prevent them from achieving their natural (that is, their nonpoetic) function. He must use every device at his command to block their direct pointing or he does not produce an aesthetic object.... The poet prevents his poem from competing with science or philosophy-that is, from yielding any propositional statement which can be extracted from it without loss of meaning-by making his context inviolable. As prose discourse was to be unambiguous, thin, transparent; so poetic discourse is to be purposely ambiguous, dense, opaque and indeed reflective. If there is within the poem any possible proposition, it is so laden by its context with qualifications, double meanings, and ironic contradictions that it can no longer stand as a proposition. It is too ambiguous, too con- founded for the realm of logic.13 This "solution" requires a magical control over the medium of words which is beyond the power of the writer. It is schizoid in its conception of language, assuming that a given word can be one thing at one time and something entirely different at another. Most specifically, this reaction to the problem of meaning must rest upon a radical distinction between the language of poetry and the language of science, whether it be called a distinction between the language of metaphor and the language of statement, between presentational and dis- cursive language, between the language of poetic texture and that of logical structure, or between expressive or depth language and steno-language.'4 Metaphor as the distinguishing feature of poetry is perhaps the most familiar basis for a distinction between the language of imaginative literature and that of science. Yet the usefulness of metaphor in science is obvious, as is the virtual impossibility of eliminating metaphor from the language of science. Any expres- sion describing the operation of the mind necessarily involves reification; in psychology such metaphors as "states of mind" and "stream of consciousness" have been essential to the development of theories of mental processes; in phys- ical science the metaphor of electricity as a fluid has analogically contributed much to knowledge; in metaphysics the categories of cause, force, and law are anthropomorphic (and thus metaphoric) in origin.15 But, the contextualist will object, words function differently in poems and in scientific statements. The words of poems, which are contextually controlled, interact only with the other words of the poem, thus contributing to the com- plexity and self-sufficiency of the little world of which they are the elements. The terms of a scientific statement, in contrast, reach out to the world of vi- brant particulars which they anatomize and predaceously attempt to subsume under general laws. (The animism of, as well as the animus behind this distinc- tion is typical not only of the extreme contextualists; J. C. Ransom, for example, 13 The New Apologists, pp. 131-132. One of the most effective logical refutations of this argument is R. S. Crane's demolition of Brooks' untenable distinction between scientific and poetic discourse based on an assertion of irony (and contextual qualification) as the differentia of poetry. ("The Critical Monism of Cleanth Brooks," Critics and Criticism Ancient and Modern [University of Chicago Press, 1952], pp. 102-105. 14 This last distinction is Philip Wheelwright's, in The Burning Fountain, a Study in the Language of Symbolism (Indiana University Press, 1954), p. 3. 16 See M. R. Cohen, "On the Logic of Fiction," A Preface to Logic, especially pp. 95-100.</page><page sequence="5">THE CONTEXTUALIST DILEMMA-OR FALLACY? 223 imputes feeling and volition to the Poem, as well as to Science, which he con- siders predatory and selfish in spirit.)16 In keeping with this difference, the contextualist critic will say, the poem and the scientific statement are apprehended differently. The scientific state- ment is apprehended progressively, in time, as the ramifications of its rela- tionship to the experiential world are understood. But the poem or aesthetic object is apprehended as a self-contained entity, which entraps the reader or viewer, which presents itself to him with the immediacy of revelation, and which frees him from the consciousness of self and of the common world of space and time, while he surrenders himself to the laws of the world he has imaginatively entered. The state of the reader or viewer is described by Eliseo Vivas in his "Defi- nition of the Aesthetic Experience" as "an experience of rapt attention which involves the intransitive apprehension of an object's immanent meanings and values in their full presentational immediacy." In scientific cognition, however, "the knower does not center his attention intransitively on a self- sufficient object, but on relations, implicative or causal, that branch out indefi- nitely from it backwards and forwards, towards the hypothesis his inquiry confirms or towards the consequences and the new problems it opens up."17 This distinction, which emphasizes the preoccupation with relations of the scien- tific statement, loses much of its force in the light of the fact that the creation of metaphor involves a recognition of resemblances or relationships be- tween objects of different classes, a perception regarded by Aristotle as the mark of genius. Also, the emphasis in the other term of the distinction on the self-sufficiency of the poem is weakened by Vivas' acknowledgment, in another place, that the "intrinsic meanings of the poem derive from non-aesthetic sources," such as the "source . . in life as lived by the man who wrote the poem."'8 Furthermore, in discussing the task of criticism, he speaks of certain "presuppositions" that support the aesthetic experience: Having read the novel intransitively, we can ask what the presuppositions are which must be posited as required to bring about and to sustain in the aesthetic transaction the work we have read.'9 As for C6line's Journey to the End of the Night, which Vivas uses as an example, the novel is regarded as "thoroughly consistent" and proof of "superb creative power," but because the "presuppositions that control it are perverse," aes- thetic appreciation of the work is thwarted: "Aesthetically it would have to be shown that in the case of Journey the intransitivity of the transaction is blocked by the informed substance of the novel."20 16 See Ransom, The World's Body, pp. 115-116 and passim. Ransom's hatred of abstraction and his personification of science are paradoxical in the light of Kathleen Nott's observa- tion that hypostasis is the extreme of abstraction.

Actually, the referential character of the poem's language contributes to the complexity of the work, because the associations of the words necessarily derive from the experience of the reader, are valued by him according to their truth or falsity as well as in other ways, and hence regulate the interaction of the words within the poem as well. Also, the process of reading a poem is not sustained and intransitive, as Vivas' "Definition of the Aesthetic Experience" claims. It is typically distinguished by an intermittent awareness of the world of experience, to which the words of the poem stimulate reference, and by pauses for reflection; and much of the appreciation of form is necessarily retrospective.23 III The problem of defending the cognitive status of imaginative literature while recognizing a dichotomy between its language and that of science has taxed the ingenuity of critics and aestheticians. Of their efforts, one of the most interesting and suggestive is Morris Weitz's attempt to resolve the emotive- referential dispute by a theory of linguistically-referential truth claims advanced through the "depth meaning of a poem."24 Mr. Weitz bases his discussion on a quotation from DeWitt Parker: Many poems and some works of plastic art possess what I like to call "depth meanings"- meanings of universal scope underneath relatively concrete meanings or ideas. Thus in the following line of one of Frost's little poems Nothing gold can stay the word "gold" has its usual surface meaning, but underneath that is its depth meaning, 21 Vivas explains (p. 102) that his term "informed substance" refers to "the non-aesthetic aspect of the subject matter after it has been elaborated in the creative process. .. ." How- ever, if a poem is considered as a pattern of words which constitute a complex of potential meaning and value, it is difficult to see how it can at the same time contain any "subject matter" or possess a "non-aesthetic aspect." 22 Consider Morris Cohen's definition of logic as the heart of philosophy because "the subject matter of logic is the formal aspect of all being ..." (A Preface to Logic, p. 10.) 23 For a discussion of the oscillation between absorption and reflection, between analysis and synthesis in the perception of aesthetic form, see Thomas Munro, Toward Science in Aesthetics (New York, 1956), pp. 20-21, and Theodore M. Greene, The Arts and the Art of Criticism, 2nd ed.

We can then point out that the emotive theory possesses an initial credi- bility only because it neglects the entire realm of depth meanings in literature by confining itself to the meanings presented immediately through the printed page.26 Mr. Weitz goes on to say that through the depth meanings "truth claims," which may or may not be true, are made, and that in view of this fact litera- ture is "as linguistically referential as science."27 For Mr. Weitz the "depth meaning" distinction does not solve the whole problem of the emotive-referential conflict, but it does solve at least part of it. It serves to establish the fact that even where no explicit "claims" are made by poetry, they may be inferred or interpreted as existing in the poem's meta- phorical dimension. (Actually, the term depth meaning seems to be simply a new and not particularly advantageous way of designating a metaphorical level of meaning.) The weakness of a distinction based upon depth meanings is ac- knowledged by Weitz in his comment that truth claims can also be made "within the printed sentences," or on the explicit or plain sense level. The only element of truth which Weitz allows the emotive theory is in his third category of poems, "in which there are no printed or implied truth claims, but instead articulations of wishes or commands or expressions of attitudes."28 Elizabeth Barrett Browning's "How do I love thee..." is given as an example of this type, but here as in other examples given an argument for the existence of im- plied truth claims could be made. Actually the "depth meaning" solution is even weaker than Mr. Weitz al- lows. In the Frost poem which both Parker and Weitz cite, a truth claim is made on what Parker calls the level of the poem's "surface meaning" as well as on the level of its depth meaning. Explicitly the word gold in the line, "Nothing gold can stay," refers to the delicate green-gold tint of the early leafing stage in the nature cycle, as is indicated by the first line of the poem, "Nature's first green is gold . . ." The poetic effectiveness of this opening verse depends largely upon the closeness of the poet's observation, or, more specifi- cally, upon the exactness of the reference to nature of the poem's words. Also, the assertion in the poem of the impermanence of this stage is a truth claim verifiable by common observation. However, even in the first verse it is impos- sible to limit the reference of the word gold to an objective observation of the 26 DeWitt Parker, The Principles of Aesthetics, 2nd ed. (New York, 1946), p. 32. 26 Philosophy of the Arts, p. 137. 27 Ibid., p. 141. 28 Ibid., pp. 145-146. The preceding two categories are defined as follows: "Poetry can embody truth claims within the printed sentences; this is the first category. It can also embody truth claims as depth meanings."</page><page sequence="8">226 WALTER SUTTON nature cycle, not only because of the connotations of the word but also because the poet introduces the motive of volition in the line following, "Her hardest hue to hold," and it is apparent that the observation about the passing of the golden stage refers to the transience of beauty in the world of nature and that this fact is a source of regret to the poet. When Frost extends the implications of the image from nature to the specifically human world, as he does through the lines Then leaf subsides to leaf. So Eden sank to grief ..., we recognize that the fall or passing of the early foliage represents the fall of man as well, that gold represents a complex of human values relating to the experience of idealized passion and of youthful romantic expectancy of ful- fillment. The feeling of regret expressed through the allusion to the garden myth includes the poignant sense of alienation in aging self-conscious man as he con- templates the phenomenon of renewal in unconscious nature. The word gold in the final line, "Nothing gold can stay," comprehends these meanings and more (which are not limited to the contextual world of the poem), and it is impossible to draw a line between the "surface" or "concrete" meanings and the "depth" meanings of the poem. Explicit statement, allusion, and suggestive nature images rich in human associations interact to provide expression for whatever concepts or truth claims the poem may yield.2 This statement may seem to be an argument for the contextualist point of view, since it empha- sizes the interaction of the elements of the poem, but it is not, because the poem is not regarded as a closed system but rather as dependent for its effect upon the references of its terms to observed nature, to knowledge of the human past, and to common experience. Mr. Weitz's discussion does, however, effectively expose the weakness of the emotive theory. His treatment of the depth meanings of novels like Native Son and Studs Lonigan also demonstrates the social importance of the truth claims of literature.30 The extent to which the references of words may actually contribute to the aesthetic effect of the poem or novel is not considered by Weitz, although the question is pertinent. IV It would seem to be true, as even the brief discussion of the Frost poem indi- cates, that the references of words (as to the nature cycle and to the story of the fall) contribute to the effectiveness of the work. This situation suggests that, although the words of a poem are conditioned by their context, their refer- ential functions are essential to an aesthetic response to the work. It might 29 For a discussion of the way in which propositions which refer to factual objectives can be expressed through images, see Bertrand Russell's treatment of image-propositions in "On Propositions," Logic and Knowledge, Essays 1901-1950, ed.

One perspective for considering the referential nature of poetic language is supplied by DeWitt Parker's observation that the history of aesthetics has been successively dominated by three general conceptions of art: as imitation, as imagination, and as expression or language. In Parker's view these three conceptions are not mutually exclusive. Although for him the conception of art as imagination needs to be supplemented by the conception of art as lan- guage, there is no contradiction between the two. He advances as the best short definition of art "Shelley's 'the expression of the imagination,' which unites the two points of view-of communication or language, and of the dream, self- sufficing and detached."3' Despite Parker's assurance, there is a conflict between the idea of the language of the poem as a "self-sufficing" dream, or revelation, and the idea of the poem as communication in a common language, having reference to the world of common experience. Even if we ignore for a moment the fact, for which psy- choanalysis provides abundant evidence, that dreams are not self-sufficing but refer to the experiential world, we see that to embrace both ideas in Parker's terms is not logically possible. Furthermore, to maintain as does the extreme contextualist that the language of the poem constitutes an organic and "in- violable" unity is to ignore the actual nature of language.32 The value of Parker's statement is in its suggestion that the conception of art as language has supplanted the Platonic and romantic conceptions of art as imagination. To consider art as language is at the same time to recognize that in literature the poem or novel cannot be a closed system possessing an inviolable unity or wholeness. A linguistic consideration of poetry must take account of the primary status and the complexity of the parent language and recognize that any categorical limitation of the function of language, in what- ever mode of discourse, is only provisional and a matter of emphasis. Charles W. Morris, for example, whose definition of the three dimensions of sign func- tioning (the syntactical, the semantical, and the pragmatical) has been fre- quently cited by the contextualists in support of their syntactical view of poetic language, observes that "the aesthetic sign, in common with all signs, has all three dimensions of sign functioning."33 Ren6 Wellek also, in comparing a liter- ary work to a system of language, comments that "we as individuals shall never realize it [the work] completely, for we shall never use our own language 31 "Aesthetics," Twentieth Century Philosophy, ed. D. D. Runes (New York, 1943), p. 47. I am indebted for this reference to Morris Weitz, as cited above. 32 Although critics like Brooks (The Well Wrought Urn, p. 228) issue disclaimers ac- knowledging the common nature of language which places the reader at the beginning "out- side" the poem, the emphasis upon the inviolability of the actual poem and the insistence that syntax, or context, controls the meanings and values of the words within the poem both fail to acknowledge the "impure" and spontaneously-referential nature of language in a poetic or any other context. 33 See Morris, "Science, Art and Technology," The Kenyon Review, I (1939), 409-423, and Ransom's criticism of Morris in The New Criticism, pp. 282-287.</page><page sequence="10">228 WALTER SUTTON completely and perfectly,"34-an observation that assumes the individual work to be structurally determined by its parent language and that implicitly denies the idea of contextual wholeness or self-sufficiency. A view of art as language also points up the contextualist distortion of the organic theory of form. While basing his theory upon a supposed relation to nature, the extreme contextualist tends to ignore the fact that neither a work of art nor any actual organism in nature is really self-sufficient. The organism is dependent upon external nature for its inception and development. The form of a tree is modified by the shaping influences of environment as it sends roots abroad in sparse soil for nutriment, reaches with its branches toward a northern light when shaded to the south, and inclines its trunk in the direction of pre- vailing winds. So too the poem or novel has an organic relationship to its en- vironment as the expression of an individual artist whose way of seeing and writing has been influenced by the society in which he lives. The work is com- posed of the common elements of language, given currency through conven- tion. Its linguistic structure is determined not only by the conventions of com- mon language but also by existing literary conventions as these are modified by the writer responding to his moment. The completed work is not a self- sufficient and self-integrated phenomenon. Its character changes with changes in the language from which it derives. The time comes when, either because of extreme changes in the parent language or because of changing patterns of response in readers, the words of the poem fail to stimulate continued reading. The poem or novel dies, of inanition. It may be revivified by a critic with suffi- cient historical and linguistic knowledge, but if so it is limited to a laboratory existence in a culture artificially produced and maintained. Henry James, writing as both an artist and critic in his "Art of Fiction," points out that the organic theory of form does not allow the work to be thought of as a self-sufficient, closed system. He refers to the novel as "a living thing, one and continuous, like any other organism," but he also insists that the ar- rangement of words that is the novel is effective only as it satisfies a common sense of experienced reality outside the work. James defines the novel broadly as "a personal, a direct impression of life." As an "impression of life," he de- fends the idea of the novel as history. While art necessarily involves selection, James asserts that the selection must be typical and must respect the order of events in nature or in human experience to which its words refer. Of fiction he says, In proportion as in what she offers us we see life without rearrangement do we feel that we are touching the truth; in proportion as we see it with rearrangement do we feel that we are being put off with a substitute, a compromise and convention.3s The literary work is integral with the culture in which it originates, even though it may seem sometimes an exotic growth. Its medium, language, is itself a cultural growth and an instrument for the communication of knowl- 34 Ren6 Wellek and Austin Warren, Theory of Literature (New York, 1949), p. 153. 35 "The Art of Fiction," Literary Criticism, Pope to Croce, ed.

The shaping of this medium by the writer proceeds with respect to com- mon usage and a shared sense of the meaning of the events in experience which the language evokes. In ordering his words, the writer presents a sequence of imagined events (in the broadest sense) which must refer, even if indirectly, to experienced events. The idea of a "sequence of imagined events" does not posit a narrative element in the usual sense, nor does it imply a distinction be- tween prose fiction and poetry. The images and statements of feeling in a lyric poem are events which appeal to corresponding events in the reader's experience. As James suggests, these fictional events compel imaginative accept- ance only if they satisfy the reader's sense of reality. It is through this relationship that the words receive whatever conceptual and affective "charge" they bear. Without an arrangement of words that appeals to common experience and a shared sense of value, there can be no order, or no form. (This statement is not to suggest as a criterion the conven- tional values of popular art designed for mass consumption; C6line's Journey to the End of the Night, which Mr. Vivas oddly condemns for its author's per- verse presuppositions, is imaginatively compelling precisely because it-like Orwell's 1984-appeals to common experience and a shared sense of value in a world threatened by mass destruction and totalitarianism.) The only alterna- tive to a work thus referentially ordered would be-if the contextualist were consistent-a poem or novel composed in a private language and having form only for its creator. It is perhaps preferable to view form as a potential of the linguistic structure of a work that cannot be realized by the writer or the reader without recourse to the referential world of experience, which includes the ex- perience of language.</page></plain_text>
